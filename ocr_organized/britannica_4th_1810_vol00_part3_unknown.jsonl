The orb was generally formed six deep.\n\n**Orbit**, in Astronomy, the path of a planet or comet, or the curve that it describes in its revolution round its central body; thus, the earth's orbit is the curve which it describes in its annual course round the sun, and usually called the **ecliptic**.

See Orkney.\n\n**Orchard**, a garden-department, configned entirely to the growth of standard fruit-trees, for furnishing a large supply of the most useful kinds of fruit. For the particular management of the orchard, see Gardening.\n\nIn the orchard you may have, as standards, all sorts of apple-trees, most sorts of pears and plums, and all sorts of cherries: which four species are the capital orchard fruits; each of them comprising numerous valuable varieties. But to have a complete orchard, you may also have quinces, medlars, mulberries, service-trees, filberts, Spanish nuts, berberies; likewise walnuts and chestnuts; which two latter are particularly applicable for the boundaries of orchards, to screen the other trees from the insults of impetuous winds and cold blasts. All the trees ought to be arranged in rows from 20 to 30 feet distance, as hereafter directed.\n\nBut sometimes orchards consist entirely of apple-trees, particularly in the cider-making counties, where they are cultivated in very great quantities in large fields, and in hedge-rows, for the fruit to make cider for public supply.\n\nAnd sometimes whole orchards of very considerable extent are entirely of cherry-trees. But in this case, it is when the fruit is designed for sale in some great city, as London, &c. for the supply of which city, great numbers of large cherry orchards are in some of the adjacent counties, but more particularly in Kent, which is famous for very extensive cherry-orchards; many of which are entirely of that sort called Kentish cherry, as being generally a great bearer; others are stored with all the principal sorts of cultivated cherries, from the earliest to the latest kinds.\n\nA general orchard, however, composed of all the before-mentioned fruit-trees, should consist of a double portion of apple-trees or more, because they are considerably the most useful fruit, and may be continued for use the year round.\n\nThe utility of a general orchard, both for private use and profit, stored with the various sorts of fruit-trees, must be very great, as well as afford infinite pleasure from the delightful appearance it makes from early spring till late in autumn: In spring the various trees in blossom are highly ornamental; in summer, the pleasure is heightened by observing the various fruits advancing to perfection; and as the season advances, the mature growth of the different species arriving to perfection, in regular succession, from May or June, until the end of October, must afford exceeding delight, as well as great profit.\n\n**Of the Extent, Situation, and Soil for the Orchard.**\n\nVol. XV. Part II.\n\nAs to the proper extent of ground for an orchard, this Orchard must be proportioned, in some measure, to the extent of land you have to work on, and the quantity of fruit required either for private use or for public supply; so that an orchard may be from half an acre to 20 or more in extent.\n\nWith respect to the situation and aspect for an orchard, we may observe very thriving orchards both in low and high situations, and on declivities and plains, in various aspects or exposures, provided the natural soil is good: we should, however, avoid very low damp situations as much as the nature of the place will admit; for in very wet soils no fruit trees will prosper, nor the fruit be fine; but a moderately low situation, free from copious wet, may be more eligible than an elevated ground, as being less exposed to tempestuous winds; though a situation having a small declivity is very desirable, especially if its aspect incline towards the east, south-east, or southerly, which are rather more eligible than a westerly aspect; but a north aspect is the worst of all for an orchard, unless particularly compensated by the peculiar temperament or good quality of the soil.\n\nAnd as for soil, any common field or pasture that produces good crops of corn, grass, or kitchen-garden vegetables, is suitable for an orchard; if it should prove of a loamy nature, it will be a particular advantage: any soil, however, of a good quality, not too light and dry, or too heavy, stubborn, or wet, but of a medium nature, of a soft, pliant temperature, not less than one spade deep of good staple, will be proper for this purpose.\n\n**Preparation of the Ground.**—The preparation of the ground for the reception of trees, is by trenching; or, if for very considerable orchards, by deep ploughing; but trench-digging, one or two spades, as the soil will admit, is the most eligible, either wholly, or only for the present in the places where the lines of trees are to stand, a space of six or eight feet wide, all the way in each row, especially if it be grass-ground, and intended to be kept in the furrow; or if any under-crops are designed to be raised, the ground may be wholly trenched at first: in either case trench the ground in the usual way to the depth of the natural soil; and if in grass, turn the furrow clean to the bottom of each trench, which, when rotated, will prove an excellent manure.\n\nIn planting orchards, however, on grass-grounds, some only dig pits for each tree, capacious enough for the reception of the roots, loosening the bottom well, without the labour of digging any other part of the ground.\n\nThe ground must be fenced securely against cattle, &c. either with a good ditch and hedge, or with a palisading-fence, as may be most convenient.\n\n**Method of planting the Trees.**—The best season for planting all the sorts of fruit-trees is autumn, soon after the fall of the leaf, from about the latter end of October until December; or indeed it might be performed any time in open weather from October until March.\n\nChoose principally full standards, with straight clean stems, six feet high; each with a branchy well-formed head, or from two or three to four or five years growth; and let several varieties of each particular species be chosen, that ripen their fruit at different times, from the earliest to the latest, according to the nature of the different...\nferent sorts, that there may be a proper supply of every sort regularly during their proper season. Of apples and pears in particular, choose a much greater quantity of the autumnal and late ripening kinds than of the early sorts, but most of all of apples; for the summer-ripening fruit is but of short duration, only proper for temporary service; but the later ripening kinds keep found some considerable time for autumnal use; and the latest sorts that ripen in October, continue in perfection for various uses all winter, and several sorts until the season of apples come again.\n\nHaving made choice of the proper sorts, and marked them, let them be taken up with the utmost care, so as to preserve all their roots as entire as possible; and when taken up, prune off any broken or bruised parts of the roots, and just tip the ends of the principal roots, in general, with the knife on the under side with a kind of slope outward.\n\nIf the trees have been already headed, or so trained as to have branched out into regular shoots to form each a proper head, they must be planted with the said heads entire, only retrenching or shortening any irregular or ill-placed shoot that takes an awkward direction, or grows across its neighbours, or such as may run considerably longer than all the rest, &c.\n\nThe arrangement of the trees in the orchard must be in rows, each kind separate, at distances according to the nature of the growth of the different sorts; but for the larger growing kinds, such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, &c., they should stand from 25 to 30 or 40 feet every way asunder, though 25 or 30 feet at most is a reasonable distance for all these kinds.\n\nEach species and its varieties should generally be in rows by themselves, the better to suit their respective modes of growth: though for variety there may be some rows of apples and pears arranged alternately, as also of plums and cherries; and towards the boundaries there may be ranges of lesser growth, as quinces, medlars, filberts, &c., and the outer row of all may be walnut-trees, and some chestnuts, set pretty close to defend the other trees from violent winds.\n\nAccording to the above distances, proceed to stake out the ground for making the holes for the reception of the trees, which if made to range every way, will have a very agreeable effect, and admit the currency of air, and the sun's influence more effectually.\n\nBut in planting very extensive orchards, some divide the ground into large squares or quarters, of different dimensions, with intervals of 50 feet wide between; serving both as walks, and for admitting a greater currency of air; in different quarters planting different sorts of fruit, as apples in one, pears in another, plums and cherries in others, &c., and thus it may be repeated as many quarters for each species and its varieties as may be convenient.\n\nAs to the mode of planting the trees: A wide hole must be dug for each tree, capacious enough to receive all the roots freely every way without touching the sides. When the holes are all ready, proceed to planting, one tree in each hole, a person holding the stem erect, whilst another trims in the earth, previously breaking it small, and calling it in equally all about the roots, frequently shaking the tree to cause the mould to settle in close about all the smaller roots and fibres, and so as to raise the tree gradually up, that the crown of the roots may be but two or three inches below the general surface; and when the hole is filled up, tread it gently, first round the outside, then near the stem of the tree, forming the surface a little hollow; and then, if on the top of all be laid some inverted turf to the width of the hole, forming it with a sort of circular bank, three or four inches high, it will support the tree, and guard the roots from drying winds and the summer's drought: observing that each tree stand perfectly upright, and that they range exactly in their proper rows.\n\nMethod of improving the Fruit.—The following method is said to have been successfully employed by a German clergyman, in promoting the growth of young trees, and increasing the size and flavour of the fruit in orchards. Having planted several young plum trees in an orchard, he covered the ground, for some years, around the trunks, as far as the roots extended, with flax-shows, or the refuse of flax when it is fetched or heckled; by which means these trees, though in a grass-field, increased in a wonderful manner, and far excelled others planted in cultivated ground. As far as the shows reached, the grass and weeds were choked; and the soil under them was so tender and soft, that no better mould could have been wished for by a florist.\n\nWhen he observed this, he covered the ground with the same substance, as far as the roots extended, around an old plum-tree, which appeared to be in a languishing state, and which stood in a grass-field. The consequences were, that it acquired a strong new bark, produced larger and better-tasted fruit, and that those young shoots, which before grew up around the stem, and which it was every year necessary to destroy, were prevented from sprouting forth, as the covering of flax-shows impeded the free access of air at the bottom of the trunk.\n\nIn the year 1793, he transplanted, from seed-beds, into the nursery, several fruit-trees; the ground around some of which he covered, as above, with flax-shows. Notwithstanding the great heat of the summer, none of those trees where the earth was covered with shows died or decayed, because the shows prevented the earth under them from being dried by the sun. Of those trees, around which the ground was not covered as before mentioned, the fourth part miscarried; and those that continued alive were far weaker than the former.\n\nThe leaves which fall from trees in autumn may also be employed for covering the ground in like manner; but stones, or logs of wood must be laid on them, to prevent their being dispersed by the wind. In grassland, a small trench may be made around the roots of the tree, when planted, in order to receive the leaves. If flax shows are used, this is not necessary; they lie on the surface of the ground so fast as to resist the force of the most violent storm. The leaves which our author found most effectual in promoting the growth and fertility of fruit trees, are those of the walnut-tree. Whether it is, that, on account of their containing a greater abundance of saline particles, they communicate manure to the ground, which thereby becomes tender under them; or that they attract nitrous particles from the atmosphere; or that, by both these means, they tend to nourish the tree both above and below.\n\nThose who are desirous of raising tender exotic trees from the seed, in order to accustom them to our climate, may,\nOrchestra may, when they transplant them, employ flax-shows with great advantage. This covering will prevent the frost from making its way to the roots; and rats and mice, on account of the sharp prickly points of the flax-shows, will not be able to shelter themselves under them.\n\n**Orchestra**, in the Grecian theatres, was that part of the *proscenium* or stage where the chorus used to dance. In the middle of it was placed the *orchestra* or *pulpit*. The orchestra was semicircular, and surrounded with seats. In the Roman theatres it made no part of the *scena*, but answered pretty nearly to the pit in our playhouses, being taken up with seats for senators, magistrates, vestals, and other persons of distinction. The actors never went down into it. See **Theatre**.\n\n**Orchia lex**, instituted by Orchius the tribune in the year of Rome 566. Its intention was to limit the number of guests that were to be admitted at an entertainment; and it also enforced, that during supper, which was the chief meal among the Romans, the doors of every house should be left open.\n\n**Orchis, Fool-Stones**; a genus of plants belonging to the gynandra clasps, and in the natural method giving name to the seventh order, *Orchidaceae*. See **Botany Index**.\n\n**Orcus**, god of the infernal regions, the same with Pluto, so called from the Greek word ὁρκος, signifying a \"tomb or sepulchre,\" or from ὁρκος, \"an oath by the river Styx.\" The ancients gave this name to all the divinities of the infernal regions, even to Cerberus. There was a river of the same name in Thessaly, which took its rise from the marshes of the Styx, and the waters of which were so thick that they floated like oil upon the surface of the river Peneus, into which they discharged themselves. This river probably suggested to the poets the idea of the infernal abodes, which they denominated Orcus. This deity has been confounded with Charon, he had a temple at Rome.\n\n**Ordeal**, an ancient form of trial. See **Trial**. It was an appeal to the immediate interposition of divine power, and was particularly distinguished by the appellation of *judicium Dei*; and sometimes *vulgaris purgatio*, to distinguish it from the canonical purgation, which was by the oath of the party. There were two sorts of it more common than the rest, at least in Europe; fire-ordeal, and water-ordeal. The former was confined to persons of higher rank, the latter to the common people. Both these might be performed by deputy; but the principal was to answer for the success of the trial; the deputy only venturing some corporal pain, for hire or perhaps for friendship.\n\nThat the purgation by ordeal, of some kind or other, is very ancient, admits not of a doubt; and that it was very universal in the times of superstitious barbarity, is equally certain. It seems even to have been known to the ancient Greeks; for in the Antigone of Sophocles, a person suspected by Creon of a misdemeanor, declares himself ready \"to handle hot iron and to walk over fire\" in order to manifest his innocence; which the scholiast tells us was then a very usual purgation. And Grotius gives us many instances of water-ordeal in Bithynia, Sardis, and other places. It seems, however, to be carried to a greater height among the Hindoos, than ever it has been in any nation or among any people, however rude or barbarous; for in a paper of the Asiatic Researches communicated by Warren Hastings, Esq., we find that the *trial by ordeal* among them is conducted in nine different ways: firstly, by the balance; secondly, by fire; thirdly, by water; fourthly, by poison; fifthly, by the Coflia, or water in which an idol has been washed; sixthly, by rice; seventhly, by boiling oil; eighthly, by red-hot iron; ninthly, by images.\n\nI. Ordeal by the balance is thus performed. The beam having been previously adjusted, the cord fixed, and both scales made perfectly even, the person accused and a Pandit fast a whole day; then, after the accused has been bathed in sacred water, the *homa*, or oblation, presented to fire, and the deities worshipped, he is carefully weighed; and when he is taken out of the scale, the Pandits prostrate themselves before it, pronounce a certain *mentra* or incantation, agreeably to the Sastras, and, having written the substance of the accusation on a piece of paper, bind it on his head. Six minutes after, they place him again in the scale; and, if he weigh more than before, he is held guilty; if less, innocent; if exactly the same, he must be weighed a third time; when, as it is written in the Mitacbera, there will certainly be a difference in his weight. Should the balance, though well fixed, break down, this would be considered as a proof of his guilt.\n\nII. For the fire-ordeal, an excavation, nine hands long, two spans broad, and one span deep, is made in the ground, and filled with a fire of pippal wood: into this the person accused must walk bare-footed; and, if his foot be unhurt, they hold him blameless; if burned, guilty (A).\n\n---\n\n(A) In Europe fire-ordeal was performed either by taking up in the hand, unhurt, a piece of red-hot iron, of one, two, or three pounds weight; or else by walking, barefoot, and blindfold, over nine red-hot plough-shares, laid lengthwise at unequal distances; and if the party escaped being hurt, he was adjudged innocent; but if it happened otherwise, as without collusion it usually did, he was then condemned as guilty. However, by this latter method Queen Emma, the mother of Edward the Confessor, is mentioned to have cleared her character, when suspected of familiarity with Alwyn bishop of Winchester. The first account we have of Christians appealing to the fire-ordeal, as a proof of their innocence, is that of Simplicius, bishop of Autun, who lived in the fourth century. This prelate, as the story is related, before his promotion to the episcopal order, had married a wife, who loved him tenderly, and who, unwilling to quit him after his advancement, continued to sleep in the same chamber with him. The sanctity of Simplicius suffered, at least in the voice of fame, by the constancy of his wife's affection; and it was rumoured about, that the holy man, though a bishop, persisted, in opposition to the ecclesiastical canons, to taste the sweets of matrimony: upon which his wife, in the presence of a great concourse of people, took up a considerable quantity of burning coals, which she held in her clothes, and applied to her breasts, without the least hurt to her person or her garments as the legend says; and her example being followed by her husband with the like\nIII. Water-ordeal is performed by causing the person accused to stand in a sufficient depth of water, either flowing or stagnant, to reach his navel; but care should be taken that no ravenous animal be in it, and that it be not moved by much air; a brahman is then directed to go into the water, holding a flail in his hand; and a soldier shoots three arrows on dry ground from a bow of cane; a man is next dispatched to bring the arrow which has been shot farthest; and, after he has taken it up, another is ordered to run from the edge of the water; at which instant the person accused is told to grasp the foot or the staff of the brahman, who stands near him in the water, and immediately to dive into it. He must remain under water, till the two men who went to fetch the arrows are returned; for, if he raise his head or body above the surface, before the arrows are brought back, his guilt is considered as fully proved. In the villages near Benares, it is the practice for the person who is to be tried by this kind of ordeal, to stand in water up to his navel, and then, holding the foot of a brahman, to dive under it as long as a man can walk 50 paces very gently; if, before the man has walked thus far, the accused rise above the water, he is condemned; if not, acquitted (B).\n\nIV. There are two sorts of trial by poison; first, the pandits having performed their homa, and the person accused his ablution, two rettis and a half, or seven barley-corns of vilbanaga, a poisonous root, or of faucilya, that is, white arsenic, are mixed in eight majhas, or 64 rettis, of clarified butter, which the accused must eat from the hand of a brahman; if the poison produce no visible effect, he is absolved; otherwise condemned. Secondly, the hooded snake, called naga, is thrown into a deep earthen pot, into which is dropped a ring, a feel, or a coin; this the person accused is ordered to take out with his hand; and, if the serpent bite him, he is pronounced guilty; if not, innocent.\n\nV. Trial by the colia is as follows: the accused is made to drink three daughts of the water, in which the images of the sun, of Devi, and other deities, have been washed for that purpose; and if, within 14 days, he has any sickness or indisposition, his crime is considered as proved.\n\nVI. When several persons are suspected of theft, some dry rice is weighed with the sacred stone called falgram, or certain ficus are read over it; after which the suspected persons are feverishly ordered to chew a quantity of it: as soon as they have chewed it, they are to throw it on some leaves of pippal, or, if none be at hand, on some bhujja patra, or bark of a tree, from Nepal or Cashmir. The man, from whose mouth the rice comes dry or stained with blood, is held guilty; the rest is acquitted.\n\nVII. The ordeal by hot oil is very simple: when it is heated sufficiently, the accused thrusts his hand into it; and, if he be not burned, is held innocent (C).\n\nVIII.\n\nlike success, the silly multitude admired the miracle, and proclaimed the innocence of the loving pair. A similar trick was played by St Brice, in the fifth century. Mojh. Eccl. Hist. vol. ii.\n\n(B) A very peculiar species of water-ordeal is said to prevail among the Indians on the coast of Malabar. A person accused of an enormous crime is obliged to swim over a large river abounding with crocodiles; and if he escapes unhurt, he is deemed innocent.\n\nAt Siam, besides the usual methods of fire and water ordeal, both parties are sometimes exposed to the fury of a tiger let loose for that purpose; and if the beast spares either, that person is accounted innocent; if neither, both are held to be guilty; but if he spares both, the trial is incomplete, and they proceed to a more certain criterion.\n\nIn Europe water-ordeal was performed, either by plunging the bare arm up to the elbow in boiling-water, and escaping unhurt thereby, or by casting the person suspected into a river or pond of cold water; and if he floated therein without any action of swimming, it was deemed an evidence of his guilt; but if he sunk, he was acquitted. It is easy to trace out the traditional relics of this water-ordeal, in the ignorant barbarity still practised in many countries to discover witches, by casting them into a pool of water, and drowning them to prove their innocence. And in the eastern empire the fire-ordeal was used for the same purpose by the emperor Theodore Lascaris; who, attributing his sickness to magic, caused all those whom he suspected to handle the hot iron; thus joining (as has been well remarked) to the most dubious crime in the world, the most dubious proof of innocence.\n\n(C) This species of trial by ordeal is thus performed: The ground appointed for the trial is cleared and rubbed with cow-dung, and the next day at sunrise the Pandit worships Ganesha or the Hindoo Janus, presents his oblations, and pays adoration to other deities, conformably to the Sutra; then having read the incantation prescribed, he places a round pan of gold, silver, copper, iron, or clay, with a diameter of sixteen fingers, and four fingers deep, and throws into it one fer, or eighty ficca weight, of clarified butter or oil of falamum. After this a ring of gold, or silver, or iron, is cleaned and washed with water, and cast into the oil; which they proceed to heat, and when it is very hot put into it a fresh leaf of pippola, or of bilwa: when the leaf is burned, the oil is known to be sufficiently hot. Then, having pronounced a mantra over the oil, they order the party accused to take the ring out of the pan; and if he take it out without being burned, or without a blister on his hand, his innocence is considered as proved; if not, his guilt. It is reported that this custom, with some slight variations, still prevails among the Indians on the coast of Malabar. The proofs there is said to begin after the accused person has been thoroughly washed in the presence of the prince of the country, the priests, &c.:—the pot is filled with boiling lead; and the accused must take the ring out three times successively. On the Malabar coast, this ordeal seems only to be used when the person is accused of a capital crime; for after the proofs the arm is bound with cloth and sealed; and after several days, being brought out publicly, and the arm inspected, if it is found burnt he is instantly put to death; if not, his accuser undergoes the same trial, and being burnt, forfeits his life.\nVIII. In the same manner they make an iron ball, or the head of a lance, red hot, and place it in the hands of the person accused; who, if it burn him not, is judged guilty.\n\nIX. To perform the ordeal by dharmach, which is the name of the floca appropriated to this mode of trial, either an image, named Dharma, or the genius of justice, is made of silver, and another, called Adharma, of clay or iron, both of which are thrown into a large earthen jar; and the accused having thrust his hand into it, is acquitted if he bring out the silver image, but condemned if he draw forth the iron; or, the figure of a deity is painted on white cloth, and another on black; the first of which they name dharma, and the second adharma: these are feverishly rolled up in cow-dung, and thrown into a large jar without having ever been thrown to the accused; who must put his hand into the jar, and is acquitted or convicted as he draws out the figure on white or on black cloth.\n\nThough we have proceeded thus far, we have not exhausted Mr Hastings's communication. He goes on to show (to greater extent than our limits permit us to follow him) the manner in which each ordeal above mentioned was executed, giving examples, and unfolding other particulars of some importance in developing the nature of these barbarous customs. For these particulars, however, we must refer to the book itself. But as this subject unquestionably occupies an important department in the history of human superstition, we shall give the Indian law of ordeal from the same paper; when we shall introduce some further particulars concerning this extraordinary custom, which are not to be found in the above account, but which deserve to be noticed.\n\n1. The balance, fire, water, poison, the idol—these are the ordeals used here below for the proof of innocence, when the accusations are heavy, and when the accuser offers to hazard a mula, (if he should fail):\n\n2. Or one party may be tried, if he pleases, by ordeal, and the other must then risk an amercement; but the trial may take place even without any wager, if the crime committed be injurious to the prince.\n\n3. The sovereign having summoned the accused while his clothes are yet moist from bathing, at sunrise, before he has broken his fast, shall cause all trials by ordeal to be conducted in the presence of Brahmans.\n\n4. The balance is for women, children, old men, the blind, the lame, Brahmans, and the sick; for the Sādra, fire or water, or seven barley-corns of poison.\n\n5. Unless the lots of the accuser amount to a thousand pieces of silver, the accused must not be tried by the red-hot ball, nor by poison, nor by scales; but if the offence be against the king, or if the crime be heinous, he must acquit himself by one of those trials in all cases.\n\n6. He who has recourse to the balance must be attended by persons experienced in weighing, and go down into one scale, with an equal weight placed on the other, and a groove (with water in it) marked on the beam.\n\n7. 'Thou, O balance, art the mansion of truth; thou wast anciently contrived by deities: declare the truth, therefore, O giver of success, and clear me from all suspicion.\n\n8. 'If I am guilty, O venerable as my own mother, then sink me down, but if innocent raise me aloft.' Thus shall he address the balance.\n\n9. If he sink he is convicted, or if the scales be broken: but if the firing be not broken, and he rise, aloft, he must be acquitted.\n\n10. On the trial by fire, let both hands of the accused be rubbed with rice in the husk, and well examined: then let seven leaves of the A/watt'ha (the religious fig-tree) be placed on them, and bound with seven threads.\n\n11. 'Thou, O fire, pervadest all beings: O cause of purity, who givest evidence of virtue and of sin, declare the truth in this my hand.'\n\n12. When he has pronounced this, the priest shall place in both his hands an iron ball, red-hot, and weighing fifty pala (D).\n\n13. Having taken it, he shall step gradually into seven circles, each with a diameter of fifteen fingers, and separated from the next by the same space.\n\n14. If, having cast away the hot ball, he shall again have his hands rubbed with rice in the husk, and shall show them unburned, he will prove his innocence. Should the iron fall during the trial, or should a doubt arise (on the regularity of the proceedings), he must be tried again.\n\n15. 'Preserve me, O Varuna, by declaring the truth.' Thus having invoked the god of waters, the accused shall plunge his head into the river or pool, and hold both thighs of a man, who shall stand in it up to his navel:\n\n16. A swift runner shall then hasten to fetch an arrow shot at the moment of his plunging; and if, while the runner is gone, the priest shall see the head of the accused under water, he must be discharged as innocent.\n\n17. 'Thou, O poison, art the child of Brahma, steadfast in justice and in truth: clear me then from this heavy charge, and if I have spoken truly, become nectar to me.'\n\n18. Saying this, he shall swallow the poison Sāranga, from the tree which grows on the mountain Himalaya; and if he digests it without any inflammation, the prince shall pronounce him guiltless.\n\n19. Or the priest shall perform rites to the image of some tremendous deity; and, having bathed the idol, shall make the accused to drink three handfuls of the water that has dropped from it.\n\n20. If in fourteen days after he suffers no dreadful calamity from the act of the deity or of the king, he must indubitably be acquitted.\"\n\nThe superstitious weakness of mankind, when left to themselves, is astonishing. There is indeed nothing so absurd but they may be made most firmly to believe, nor so impious but they will do. Nor can a more notorious instance of the truth of this assertion be\n\n(d) A pala is four carhas, and a carha eighty raticas, or seeds of the gunja creeper, each weighing above a grain and a quarter; or correctly, 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) gr.\nbe possibly given than that of the trial by ordeal. The grofs absurdity as well as impiety of pronouncing a man guilty unless he was cleared by a miracle, and of expecting that all the powers of nature should be suspended by an immediate interposition of Providence to save the innocent, whenever it was presumptuously required, is self-evident. Yet the origin of it may be traced as well to necessity as to superstition. At the time in which it originated in England, as well as in other countries of Europe, it was no easy matter for an innocent person, when accused of guilt, to get himself cleared by the then established mode of trial (See Trial.) It was therefore natural for superstition to fly to Heaven for those testimonies of innocence which the absurdity of human laws often prevented men from obtaining in the ordinary way; and in this way doubts did the trial by ordeal commence: and thus begun by nefecitious superstition, it was foftered by impious priestcraft and unjust power. There was during all the processions great room for collusion and deceit; and there can be no question but it was often practised: it could not therefore on any account, or in any case, be a sign of innocence or of guilt.\n\nBesides those particular methods of trial which we have already mentioned, there were some few more common in European countries; as the judicial combat—the ordeal of the crofs—the ordeal of the confined.\n\nThe judicial combat was well suited to the genius and spirit of fierce and warlike nations, and was, as we may reasonably expect, one of the most ancient and universal modes of trial. We know that it was exceedingly common in Germany in very remote ages. It was also used in some countries on the continent at pretty early periods: it is not, however, mentioned in any of the Anglo-Saxon laws; and it does not appear to have been much used in England till after the Conquest. There are, however, two remarkable instances of it upon record, which we shall give in the words of Dr Henry: \"Henry de Essex, hereditary standard-bearer of England, fled from a battle in Wales, A.D. 1158, threw from him the royal standard, and cried out, with others, that the king was slain. Some time after, he was accused of having done this with a treasonable intention, by Robert de Montfort, another great baron, who offered to prove the truth of his accusation by combat. Henry de Essex denied the charge, and accepted the challenge. When all preliminaries were adjusted, this combat was accordingly fought, in the presence of Henry II. and all his court. Essex was defeated, and expected to be carried out to immediate execution. But the king, who was no friend to this kind of trial, spared his life, and contented himself with confiscating his estate, and making him a monk in the abbey of Reading.\n\n\"The priory of Tinmouth, in Northumberland, was a cell of the abbey of St Albans'. One Simon of Tinmouth claimed a right to two corrodies, or the maintenance of two persons in the priory, which the prior and monks denied. This cause was brought before the abbot of St Albans' and his court-baron, who appointed it to be tried by combat on a certain day, before him and his barons. Ralf Gubion, prior of Tinmouth, appeared at the time and place appointed, attended by his champion, one William Pegun, a man of gigantic stature. The combat was fought, Pegun was defeated, and the prior lost his cause; at which he was so much chagrined, that he immediately resigned his office. This judicial combat is the more remarkable, that it was fought in the court of a spiritual baron, and that one of the parties was a priest.\"\n\nWe need scarcely add, that this detestable form of trial was the foundation of the no less detestable crime of duelling, which so much disgraces our age and nation; which is defended only by ignorance, false honour, and injustice; which is a relic of barbarous superstition; and which was absolutely unknown to those brave and generous nations, the Greeks and Romans, which it is so much the fashion to admire, and who in this particular so well merit our imitation. See Duel.\n\nIt was so much the custom in the middle ages of Christianity, to respect the cross even to superstition, that it would have been indeed wonderful if the same ignorant bigotry had not converted it into an ordeal: accordingly we find it used for this purpose, in so many different ways as almost to preclude description. We shall, however, transcribe, for the satisfaction of our readers, Dr Henry's account of it, and of the confined: \"In criminal trials, the judgement of the cross was commonly thus conducted. When the prisoner had declared his innocence upon oath, and appealed to the judgement of the cross, two sticks were prepared exactly like one another: the figure of the cross was cut on one of these sticks, and nothing on the other: each of them was then wrapped up in a quantity of fine white wool, and laid on the altar, or on the relics of the saints; after which a solemn prayer was put up to God, that he would be pleased to discover, by evident signs, whether the prisoner was innocent or guilty. These solemnities being finished, a priest approached the altar, and took up one of the sticks, which was uncovered with much anxiety. If it was the stick marked with the cross, the prisoner was pronounced innocent: if it was the other, he was declared guilty. When the judgement of the cross was appealed to in civil causes, the trial was conducted in this manner: The judges, parties, and all concerned, being assembled in a church, each of the parties chose a priest, the youngest and stoutest that he could find, to be his representative in the trial. These representatives were then placed one on each side of some famous crucifix; and at a signal given, they both at once stretched their arms at full length, so as to form a cross with their body. In this painful posture they continued to stand while divine service was performing; and the party whose representative dropped his arms first lost his cause.\n\n\"The confined, or the consecrated bread and cheese, was the ordeal to which the clergy commonly appealed when they were accused of any crimes; in which they acted a very prudent part, as it was attended with no danger or inconvenience. This ordeal was performed in this manner: A piece of barley bread, and a piece of cheese, were laid upon the altar, over which a priest pronounced certain conjurations, and prayed with great fervency, that if the person accused was guilty, God would send his angel Gabriel to stop his throat, that he might not be able to swallow that bread and cheese. These prayers being ended, the culprit approached the altar,\nOrdeal altar, took up the bread and cheese, and began to eat it. If he swallowed freely, he was declared innocent; but if it stuck in his throat, and he could not swallow (which we may presume seldom or never happened), he was pronounced guilty.\n\nThere were besides these a variety of other ordeals practised in Christian countries, many of which retain the same names as among Pagans, and differ only in the mode of execution. In all nations of Christians where these trials were used, we find the clergy engaged in them. Indeed, in England, so late as King John's time, we find grants to the bishops and clergy to use the judicium ferri, aquae, et ignis. And, both in England and Sweden, the clergy presided at this trial, and it was only performed in the churches or in other consecrated ground; for which Stierhoven gives the reason, Non defuit illis operae et laboris pretium; semper enim ab ejuvandi judicio aliquod luci faceretibus obveniebat. But, to give it its due praise, we find the canon law very early declaring against trial by ordeal, or vulgaris purgatio, as being the fabric of the devil, cum fit contra praecipuum Domini, Non tentabis Dominum Deum tuum. Upon this authority, though the canons themselves were of no validity in England, it was thought proper (as had been done in Denmark above a century before) to disuse and abolish this trial entirely in our courts of justice, by an act of Parliament in 3 Hen. III. according to Sir Edward Coke, or rather by an order of the king in council.\n\nIt may still perhaps be a perplexity with some of our readers how the effects of these trials were evaded, and how it was possible to appear to do, what we know could not be really done, without material injury to the persons concerned: on this subject the learned historian whom we have already quoted, observes with regard to the ordeals in ancient Britain, which, mutatis mutandis, will answer for others, that, \"If we suppose few or none escaped conviction who exposed themselves to those fiery trials, we shall be very much mistaken. For the histories of those times contain innumerable examples of persons plunging their naked arms into boiling water, handling red-hot balls of iron, and walking upon burning ploughshares, without receiving the least injury. Many learned men have been much puzzled to account for this, and disposed to think that Providence graciously interposed, in a miraculous manner, for the preservation of injured innocence. But if we examine every circumstance of those fiery ordeals with due attention, we shall see sufficient reason to suspect that the whole was a gross imposition on the credulity of mankind. The accused person was committed wholly to the priest, who was to perform the ceremony three days before the trial, in which he had time enough to bargain with him for his deliverance, and give him instructions how to act his part. On the day of trial, no person was permitted to enter the church but the priest and the accused till after the iron was heated, when twelve friends of the accuser, and twelve of the accused, and no more, were admitted, and ranged along the wall on each side of the church, at a respectful distance. After the iron was taken out of the fire, several prayers were said; the accused drank a cup of holy water, and sprinkled his hand with it, which might take a considerable time if the priest was indulgent. The space of nine feet was measured by the accused himself with his own feet, and he would probably give but feintly measure. He was obliged only to touch one of the marks with the toe of his right foot, and allowed to stretch the other foot as far towards the other mark as he could, so that the conveyance was almost instantaneous. His hand was not immediately examined, but wrapped in a cloth prepared for that purpose three days. May we not then, from all these precautions, suspect that these priests were in possession of some secret that secured the hand from the impressions of such a momentary touch of hot iron, or removed all appearance of these impressions in three days; and that they made use of this secret when they saw reason? Such readers as are curious in matters of this kind may find two different directions for making ointments that will have this effect, in the work here quoted*. What greatly strengthens these suppositions is, that we meet with no example of any champion of the church who suffered the least injury from the touch of hot iron in this ordeal: but when any one was so fool-hardy as to appeal to it, or that of hot water, with a view to deprive the church of any of her possessions, he never failed to burn his fingers, and lose his cause.\"\n\nTo this we shall add what the learned Beckmann has said concerning the imposition that was probably practised in the ordeal by fire. \"I am not acquainted with everything that concerns the trial by ordeal, when persons accused were obliged to prove their innocence by holding in their hands red-hot iron; but I am almost convinced that this also was a juggling trick of the popes, which they employed as might best suit their views. It is well known that this mode of expiation was allowed only to weak persons, who were unfit to wield arms, and particularly to monks and ecclesiastics, to whom, for the sake of their security, that by single combat was forbidden. The trial itself took place in the church, entirely under the inspection of the clergy; mass was celebrated at the same time; the defendant and the iron were consecrated by being sprinkled with holy water; the clergy made the iron hot themselves; and they used all these preparations, as jugglers do many motions, only to divert the attention of the spectators. It was necessary that the accused person should remain at least three days and three nights under their immediate care, and continue as long after. They covered his hands both before and after the proof; sealed and unsealed the covering: The former, as they pretended, to prevent the hands from being prepared any how by art; the latter, to see if they were burnt.\n\nSome artificial preparation was therefore known, else no precautions would have been necessary. It is highly probable, that during the three first days the preventive was applied to those persons whom they wished to appear innocent; and that the three days after the trial were requisite to let the hands resume their natural state. The sacred sealing secured them from the examination of presumptuous unbelievers; for to determine whether the hands were burnt, the three last days were certainly not wanted. When the ordeal was abolished, and this art rendered useless, the clergy no longer kept it a secret. In the 13th century, an account of it was published by Albertus Magnus, a Dominican monk.\nORDERS, by way of eminency, or Holy ORDERS, denote a character peculiar to ecclesiastics, whereby they are set apart for the ministry. See ORDINATION.\n\nThis the Romanists make their fifth sacrament.\n\nIn no reformed church are there more than three orders; viz. bishops, priests, and deacons. In the Romish church there are seven, exclusive of the episcopate, all which the council of Trent enjoins to be received, and believed, on pain of anathema.\n\nThey are distinguished into petty, or secular orders; and major, or sacred orders.\n\nORDERS, the petty, or minor, are four; viz. those of doorkeeper, exorcist, reader, and acolyth.\n\nThose in petty orders may marry without any dispensation: in effect, the petty orders are looked on as little other than formalities, and as degrees necessary to arrive at the higher orders. Yet the council of Trent is very serious about them; enjoins that none be admitted into them without understanding Latin; and recommends it to the bishops, to observe the intervals of conferring them, that the persons may have a sufficient time to exercise the function of each order; but it leaves the bishops a power of dispensing with those rules; so that the four orders are usually conferred the same day, and only make the first part of the ceremony of ordination.\n\nThe Greeks disavow these petty orders, and pass immediately to the subdeaconate; and the reformed to the deaconate.\n\nTheir first rise Fleury dates in the time of the emperor Justinian. There is no call nor benefice required for the four petty orders; and even a bastard may enjoy them without any dispensation; nor does a second marriage disqualify.\n\nORDERS, sacred, or major, we have already observed, are three: viz. those of deacon, priest, and bishop.\n\nThe council of Trent retrieving the ancient discipline, forbids any person being admitted to the major orders, unless he be in peaceable possession of a benefice sufficient for a decent subsistence; allowing no ordinations on patronages or pensions, except where the bishop judges it for the service of the church.\n\nA person is said to be promoted to orders per saltem, when he has not before passed the inferior orders. The council of Constantinople forbids any bishop being ordained without passing all the degrees; yet church-history furnishes us with instances of bishops consecrated, without having passed the order of priesthood; and Panormus still thinks such an ordination valid.\n\nMilitary ORDERS, are companies of knights, instituted by kings and princes, either for defence of the faith, or to confer marks of honour, and make distinctions among their subjects.\n\nReligious ORDERS, are congregations or societies of monastics, living under the same superior, in the same manner, and wearing the same habit. Religious orders\n\n---\n\n(a) In his work De Mirabilibus Mundi, at the end of his book De Secretis Mulierum, Amstelod. 1702, 12mo, p. 100.

See Monk, Canon, &c.\n\nFather Mabillon proves, that till the ninth century, almost all the monasteries in Europe followed the rule of St Benedict; and that the distinction of orders did not commence till upon the reunion of several monasteries into one congregation; that St Odo, abbot of Cluny, first began this reunion, bringing several houses under the dependence of Cluny; that, a little afterwards, in the 11th century, the Camaldulians arose; then, by degrees, the congregation of Valombrosa; the Cistercians, Carthusians, Augustines; and at last, in the 13th century, the Mendicants. He adds, that Lupus Servatus, abbot of Ferrieres, in the ninth century, is the first that seems to distinguish the order of St Benedict from the rest, and to speak of it as a particular order.\n\nWhite ORDER denotes the order of regular canons of St Augustine. See Augustines.\n\nBlack ORDER denoted the order of Benedictines.\n\nThese names were first given these two orders from the colour of their habit; but are abused since the institution of several other orders, who wear the same colours.\n\nGray ORDER was the ancient name of the Cistercians; but since the change of the habit, the name suits them no more.\n\nOrders, religious military, are those instituted in defence of the faith, and privileged to say mass; and who are prohibited marriage, &c.\n\nOf this kind are the knights of Malta, or of St John of Jerusalem. Such also were the knights Templars, the knights of Calatrava, knights of St Lazarus, Teutonic knights, &c. See Malta, Templar, &c.\n\nFather Putignani accounts those military orders where marriage is not allowed, real religious orders. Papebroch lays, it is in vain to search for military orders before the 12th century.\n\nOrders, in a military sense, all that is lawfully commanded by superior officers. Orders are given out every day, whether in camp, garrison, or on a march, by the commanding officer; which orders are afterwards given to every officer in writing by their respective sergeants.\n\nORDINAL, a book containing the order or manner of performing divine service. See Ritual.\n\nORDINAL Numbers, those which express order, as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, &c.\n\nORDINANCE or Ordonnance, a law, statute, or command of a sovereign or superior; thus the acts of parliament are sometimes termed ordinances of parliament, as in the parliament-rolls. Though in some cases we find a difference made between the two; ordinances being only temporary things, by way of prohibition; and capable of being altered by the commons alone; whereas an act is a perpetual law, and cannot be altered but by king, lords, and commons.\n\nCoke affirms, that an ordinance of parliament differs from an act, as the latter can only be made by the king, and the threefold consent of the estates; whereas the former may be made by one or two of them.\n\nORDINANCE of the Forest, is a statute made in the 34th year of Henry I. relating to forest-matters.\n\nIn the French jurisprudence, ordinances are such ordinary laws as are established by the king's authority alone. All ordinances begin with, à tous présens, et à venir futur.\n\nORDINARY, in general, signifies common, usual; thus, an ambassador, or envoy in ordinary, is one sent to reside steadily, and for a number of years, in the court of some foreign prince or state, in order to keep up a good understanding, and watch over the interest of his own nation.—This term is also applied to several officers in the king's household, who attend on common occasions. Thus we say, physician in ordinary, &c.\n\nORDINARY, in naval language, denotes the establishment of the persons employed by government to take charge of the ships of war, which are laid up in the several harbours adjacent to the royal dock-yards. These are principally composed of the warrant-officers of the said ships, as the gunner, boatswain, carpenter, deputy-purser, and cook, and three servants. There is besides a crew of labourers enrolled in the list of the ordinary, who pass from ship to ship occasionally, to pump, moor, remove, or clean them, whenever it is necessary.\n\nThe term ordinary is also applied sometimes to the ships themselves; it is likewise used to distinguish the inferior sailors from the most expert and diligent. The latter, are rated able on the navy books, and have higher pay than those who are rated ordinary.\n\nORDINARY, in common or canon law, means one who has ordinary or immediate jurisdiction in matters ecclesiastical, in any place. In this sense archdeacons are ordinaries, but the appellation is most frequently applied to the bishop of the diocese, who has of course the ordinary ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the collation to benefices within such diocese. There are some chapels, chapters, abbeys, &c. exempted from the jurisdiction of the ordinary. The archbishop is ordinary of the whole province, to visit, and receive appeals from the inferior judicatories. The Roman writers on canon law call the pope by way of eminence ordinary of ordinaries, since by the Lateran council he has usurped the right of collating, by probatum, to all benefices; in exclusion of the common collators.\n\nORDINARIES of Affizes and Sessions, was a deputy of the bishop of the diocese, anciently appointed to give malefactors their neck-veles, and judge whether they read or not; also to perform divine service for them, and assist in preparing them for death. So the ORDINARIES of Newgate, is one who is attendant in ordinary upon the condemned malefactors in that prison to prepare them for death; and he records the behaviour of such persons.\n\nORDINARY, or Honourable ORDINARY, in Heraldry, a denomination given to certain charges properly belonging to that art. See HERALDRY, Chap. III. sect. i.\n\nORDINATES, in Geometry and Conics, are lines drawn from any point of the circumference of an ellipse, or other conic section, perpendicularly across the axis, to the other side. See CONIC-SECTIONS.\n\nORDINATION, the act of conferring holy orders, or of initiating a person into the priesthood by prayer and the laying on of hands.\n\nOrdination has always been esteemed a principal prerogative of bishops, and they still retain the function\nOrdination, as a mark of spiritual sovereignty in their diocese.\n\nWithout ordination, no person can receive any benefice, parsonage, vicarage, &c. A person must be 23 years of age, or near it, before he can be ordained deacon, or have any share in the ministry; and full 24 before he can be ordained priest, and by that means be permitted to administer the holy communion. A bishop, on the ordination of clergymen, is to examine them in the presence of the ministers, who, in the ordination of priests, but not of deacons, assist him at the imposition of hands; but this is only done as a mark of assent, not because it is thought necessary. In case any crime, as drunkenness, perjury, forgery, &c., be alleged against any one that is to be ordained, either priest or deacon, the bishop ought to desist from ordaining him. The person to be ordained is to bring a testimonial of his life and doctrine to the bishop, and to give account of his faith in Latin; and both priests and deacons are obliged to subscribe the 39 articles.\n\nThe ordination of bishops is more properly and more commonly called consecration.\n\nIn the ancient discipline there was no such thing as a vague and absolute ordination; but every one was to have a church, whereof he was to be ordained clerk, or priest. In the twelfth century they grew more remiss, and ordained without any title or benefice.\n\nThe Council of Trent restored the ancient discipline, and appointed that none should be ordained but those who were provided of a benefice sufficient to subsist them. Which practice still obtains in England.\n\nThe council of Rome, in 944, orders, that no ordinations shall be held except on the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months. In England, by can. 31, ordination days are the four Sundays immediately following the Ember-weeks; being the second Sunday in Lent, Trinity-Sunday, and the Sundays following the first Wednesday after September the 14th, and December the 13th. These are the stated times; but ordinations may take place at any other time, according to the direction of the bishop or circumstances of the case.\n\nPope Alexander II. condemns ordination per salum, as they call it; i.e. the leaping to a superior order without passing through the inferior.\n\nOrdination is one of the sacraments of the church of Rome.\n\nIn the establishment of Scotland, where there are no bishops, the power of ordination is lodged in the presbytery, and by the Independents in the suffrage of the people. See Episcopacy, Presbyterians, and Independents.\n\nORDNANCE, a general name for all sorts of great guns used in war. See Gunnery.\n\nBoring of Ordnance. Till within these 20 years, iron ordnance were cast with a cylindrical cavity, nearly of the dimension of the caliber of the piece, which was afterwards enlarged to the proper caliber by means of steel-cutters fixed into the dog-head of a boring-bar-iron. Three side cutters equidistant were requisite to preserve the caliber straight and cylindrical; and a single cutter was used at the end of the bar to smooth the breech of the piece. In boring ordnance cast hollow, the piece was fixed upon a carriage that could be moved backwards and forwards in a direct line with the centre of a water-wheel; in this centre was fixed the boring-bar, of a sufficient length to reach up to the breech of the piece, or more properly to the further end of the caliber. The carriage with the piece being drawn backwards from the centre of the water-wheel to introduce the boring and finishing bars and cutters, it is then pressed forwards upon this bar by means of levers, weights, &c., and the water-wheel being set going, the bar and fullers are turned round, and clean out and smooth the caliber to its proper dimensions.\n\nExperience at last pointed out many inconveniences arising from the method of casting guns hollow, and widening the calibers by these boring bars. For the body of iron of the hollow-gun, being, at casting, in contact with the core that made the caliber within-side, and with the mould without-side, began to consolidate towards these sides in the first place, sooner than in the intermediate space, where of course the contraction of the iron takes place; by which means, all guns cast hollow become more or less spongy where they ought to have been most compact; and numberless cavities also were created round the cores, from stagnated air generated in them, which were too deep to be cut out by the boring.\n\nTo remedy these defects, iron ordnance is now universally cast solid, by which means the column of iron is greatly enlarged, and the grain more compressed; and the contraction of the iron becomes in the heart of the column, and consequently is cut out by the perforation for the caliber.\n\nGuns are bored out of the solid reversely from the hollow method. The piece A is placed upon two standards BB, by means of two journeys, turned round by the water-wheel C, the breech D being introduced into the centre of the wheel, with the muzzle towards the sliding carriage E, which is pressed forwards by a ratchet F, and weights, in the same way as the gun-carriage was in hollow-boring. Upon this sliding carriage is fixed, truly horizontal and central to the gun, the drill-bar G, to the end of which is fixed a carp's tongue drill or cutter H; which, being pressed forward upon the piece whilst it is turning round, perforates the bore, which is afterwards finished with bores and cutters as the hollow guns were. The principal difficulty of perforating solid guns truly central, arises from the contraction of the iron above-mentioned; which, resisting the drill unequally, tends to throw it out of the central line.\n\nOffice of Ordnance, an office kept within the Tower of London, which superintends and disposes of all the arms, instruments, and utensils of war, both by sea and land, in all the magazines, garrisons, and forts, in Great Britain. We have the following copious account of this establishment in Beaton's Political Index. In ancient times, before the invention of guns, this office was supplied by officers under the following names: the bowyer, the cross bowyer, the galeator or pursuitor of helmets, the armourer, and the keeper of the tents; and in this state it continued till Henry VIII. placed it under the management of a master, a lieutenant, surveyor, &c. &c.\n\nSome improvements have been since made; and this very important branch is now under the direction of the master general of the ordnance, having under him a lieutenant general, a surveyor general, a clerk, a forekeeper, a clerk of the deliveries, and a treasurer, with a very great number of inferior officers, employed in\nBoring of ORDNANCE.\n\nPlate CCCXC.\n\nD. Breech of the Gun.\nG. Drill Bar.\nH. Carps Tongue Cutter.\nOrdnance in the Tower of London, at Woolwich, and in almost all the forts, garrisons, and principal ports in his Majesty's dominions. The office of ordnance is divided into two distinct branches, the civil and the military; the latter being subordinate, and under the authority of the former. For the better understanding the business of the different officers, they shall be distinctly treated of, beginning with the principal one, viz.\n\nMajor General of the Ordnance is deemed the principal officer in the civil branch of the ordnance; yet he is always chosen from amongst the first generals in his Majesty's service. His trust is very great, as in him is vested the sole power of storing all the military magazines in the king's dominions with proper munitions of war, and likewise to supply the royal navy with what they may need in his department, the parliament granting money in the most liberal manner for this purpose. He is colonel in chief of the royal regiment of artillery, at present consisting of four battalions; and he is invested with a peculiar jurisdiction over all his majesty's engineers employed in the several fortifications in his majesty's dominions; and to him they are all accountable for their proceedings, and from him they receive their particular orders and instructions, according to the directions and commands given by his majesty in council. As master general of the ordnance he has the appointment of almost all the inferior officers and servants. He has a secretary, and an under-secretary; and besides there is a secretary and a counsel to the board of ordnance.\n\nLieutenant General of the Ordnance receives all orders and warrants signed by the master general, and from the other principal officers, and sees them duly executed, issues orders as the occasions of the state require, and gives directions for discharging the artillery when required at coronations, birth-days, signal victories, and other solemn occasions. It is also his peculiar office to see the train of artillery, and all its equipage, fitted for motion, when ordered to be drawn into the field, or sent upon any particular service. He is colonel en second of the royal regiment of artillery, and has a secretary and several inferior officers and clerks under him.\n\nSurveyor General of the Ordnance inspects the stores and provisions of war in the custody of the storekeeper, and sees that they are ranged and placed in such order as is most proper for their preservation. He allows all bills of debt, and keeps a check upon all labourers and artificers working; sees that the stores received be good and serviceable, duly proved and marked, as they ought to be, with the king's mark, taking to his assistance the rest of the officers and proof-masters. To assist him in the business of his office, he has under him the proof-master of England, and clerks, and other inferior officers.\n\nClerk of the Ordnance, an officer whose function is to record all orders and instructions given for the government of the office; all patents and grants; the names of all officers, clerks, artificers, gunners, labourers, &c., who enjoy those grants, or any other fee for the same; to draw all estimates for provisions and supplies to be made, and all letters, instructions, commissions, deputations, and contracts for his majesty's service; to make all bills of imprest and debentures, for the payment and satisfaction of work done and provisions received in the said office; and all quarter books for the salaries and allowances of all officers, clerks, &c., belonging to the office; and to keep journals and ledgers of the receipts and returns of his majesty's stores, to serve as a check between the two accountants of the office, the one for money, and the other for stores.\n\nStorekeeper of the Ordnance takes into his custody all his majesty's ordnance, munitions and stores belonging thereto, and indents and puts them in legal security, after they have been surveyed by the surveyor-general, any part of which he must not deliver without a warrant signed by the proper officers; nor must he receive back any stores formerly issued till they have been reviewed by the surveyor, and registered by the clerk of the ordnance in the book of remains; and he must take care that whatever is under his custody be kept safe, and in such readiness as to be fit for service upon the most peremptory demand.\n\nClerk of the Deliveries of the Ordnance draws all orders for delivery of any stores, and sees them duly executed; charges by indenture the particular receiver of the stores delivered; and, in order to discharge the storekeeper, registers the copies of all warrants for the deliveries, as well as the proportions delivered.\n\nTreasurer and Paymaster of the Ordnance receives and pays all moneys, both salaries and debentures in and belonging to this office. In his office are several clerks, ordinary and extraordinary, for the dispatch of business.\n\nOffice of Ordnance. Besides the principal officers already mentioned, there belong to this office two proof-masters; a clerk of the works; a surveyor for the land, and a paymaster for the sea; an architect; an astronomical observer; and other officers. The other part of this office, which is termed the military branch of the ordnance, is a chief engineer, who has under him two directors, four sub-directors, with an unlimited number of engineers in ordinary, engineers extraordinary, sub-engineers, and practitioner engineers.\n\nOrdnance Bills, commonly called ordnance debentures, are bills issued by the board of ordnance on the treasurer of that office, for the payment of stores, &c. They are not payable at any certain time, and do not bear any interest; so that the discount upon them is often very high; but they are seldom much above two years in arrears.\n\nOrdonnance, in architecture, is the composition of a building, and the disposition of its parts, both with regard to the whole and to one another; or, as Mr Evelyn expresses it, determining the measure of what is assigned to the several apartments. Thus ordnance is the judicious contrivance of the plan or mould; as when the court, hall, lodgings, &c., are neither too large nor too small, but the court affords convenient light to the apartments about it; the hall is of fit capacity to receive company; and the bed-chamber, &c., of a proper size. When these divisions are either too great or too small, with respect to the whole, as where there is a large court to a little house, or a small hall to a magnificent palace, the fault is in the ordnance. See Architecture.\n\nOrdonnance, in painting, is used for the disposition of the parts of a picture, either with regard to the whole piece, or to the several parts, as the groups, masses, contrasts, &c. See Painting.\n\nOrdovoices, ancient Britons, of whom we have the following account in Henry's History of Great Britain. They lived \"in that country which is now called...\"\nORE\n\nOrdocees, North Wales, and contains the counties of Montgomery, Merioneth, Caernarvon, Denbigh, and Flint. The Ordocees, or (as they are called by Tacitus) Ordeuces, are supposed to have been originally of the same tribe or nation with the Huicii of Warwickshire, who were under some kind of subjection to the Cornovii; but the Huicii of North Wales, being a free and independent people, were called Ordh Huici, or the free Huici. When they were invaded by the Romans, they showed a spirit worthy of their name, and fought with great bravery in defense of their freedom and independency. Though they received a great defeat from the Roman general Ostorius, in conjunction with the Silures, they maintained the war for a considerable time, until they were finally subdued, with great slaughter, by the renowned Agricola. It was probably owing to the nature of the country, and to the vicinity of Diva, now Chester, where a whole legion was quartered, that the Romans had so few towns or stations in the territories of the Ordocees. Mediolanum, which is mentioned by Ptolemy, was the capital of the nation, and was probably situated at Maywood, in Montgomeryshire. It was a place of some consideration in the Roman times, but was afterwards quite demolished by Edwin, king of Northumberland. Besides this, the Romans had a few other towns in this country; as Segontium, now Caernarvon; Conovium, now Conway; and Varce, now Bodvary, which are all mentioned in the eleventh journey of Antoninus. The country of the Ordocees was comprehended in the Roman province which was called Britannia Secunda.\n\nORE, a mineral body, partly or entirely composed of metallic substances, in the natural state in which it exists in the earth. Metallic substances are found, either native, that is, pure, and uncombined with other substances, or alloyed with other metals, or combined with oxygen, or sulphur, or with acids; and thus it appears, that metals exist in ores, in four different states. 1. In the metallic state, when they are either pure, or combined with each other, as in the state of alloy. 2. In the state of an oxide. 3. Combined with sulphur in the state of sulphuret. And 4. with acids, forming salts. For the particular description of ores, see MINERALOGY; and for the mode of their distribution in the earth, see GEOLOGY.\n\nBut ores are rarely found exactly in the state of combination now mentioned. It seldom indeed happens, that they are not mixed with various earthly minerals. As all metals are extracted from ores, it is of great importance to be acquainted in the first place, with the materials of which they are composed, as they are obtained from the earth, with the view of ascertaining the nature and proportions of the various ingredients which enter into the composition; and in the second place, to know the simplest and easiest processes by which the metals may be separated, for the purposes of economy and manufactures. Hence, in the treatment of ores, two objects are in view. The first is their analysis, which is the province of the chemical philosopher; and the second is their reduction in the large way, which is the business of the metallurgist. The most improved methods for accomplishing each of these objects, will be detailed in the following treatise.\n\nORES, REDUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF.\n\nIn the treatment of metallic ores, it has been already hinted, that two objects are in view: the one is to obtain a knowledge of the nature and proportions of their component parts; and the other is to be acquainted with the best methods of separating the metals which they contain, that they may be applied in their pure or uncombined state to useful purposes. In the following treatise, therefore, we shall keep in view the same objects; and under each of the metals we shall first detail the most improved methods of analyzing its different ores; and, secondly, give a short account of the best and most approved processes that are employed in their reduction. The last object, however, refers only to some of the metals, others not being found in sufficient quantity, or not being applicable to useful purposes.\n\nIn this treatise we shall consider the metals in the same order in which they have been described under MINERALOGY, and to each metal we shall devote a particular chapter.\n\nCHAP. I. Of the Ores of Platina.\n\nPlatina, on account of its infusibility, density, and indestructibility, is one of the most important and useful of the metals yet known, and particularly for different chemical instruments and utensils, because there are few chemical agents whose effects it cannot resist. Platina is only found in the state of alloy, with rhodium and palladium, two of the newly discovered metals; and it is accompanied also with another alloy, iridium and osmium, also newly discovered metals, as well as with particles of iron, gold, and some other substances. The discovery of these metals, and the importance of platina itself, have rendered the ores of this metal peculiarly interesting. We shall therefore in the present chapter, give a pretty full detail of the methods of analyzing the ore, and of working it for the purposes of manufacture. These subjects will occupy the two following sections.\n\nSECT. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Platina.\n\nThe whole of the platina which is brought to Europe, has been previously subjected to the process of amalgamation in South America; and hence it happens, that a small quantity of mercury remains in it, sometimes in very small distinct particles, but more commonly in a state of combination with gold, in the form of an amalgam. In treating the ores of platina, therefore, the first object is to separate the mercury, and the easiest process is to drive it off by means of heat, either in an open ladle, if it be not intended to collect the mercury, or in an earthen retort, if the object of the operator be to retain that metal. The platina remaining after the mercury is thus driven off, appears much yellower, because the particles of gold dispersed through it exhibit their peculiar colour. The ore is next to be spread out thin on a smooth table, and by means of a pair of common bellows, the lighter particles may be separated with tolerable\nPlatina, on account of its peculiar properties in resisting great degrees of heat and the action of many of the most powerful chemical agents, is by far the most important and valuable of the metals yet known for the purpose of constructing various instruments and utensils which are found highly useful in chemical analysis. But the refractory nature of this metal has presented many difficulties, and has greatly exercised the ingenuity and skill of chemists and artists to render it malleable and capable of assuming the requisite forms. It has been observed that the largest and whitest grains picked out from crude platina have a considerable degree of malleability even when cold; but when they are heated, this property appears in greater perfection: and if two of these grains be brought into contact, and subjected to the highest degree of white heat, the stroke of a hammer will make them adhere more or less perfectly. In this way, a mass of metal may be obtained by the union of a few grains. But it is obvious that the patience and dexterity required in this slow and tedious process will prevent it from being practically useful.\n\nIn the progress of experiments made on platina, it was discovered that arsenic combined readily with that metal, and formed an alloy of easy fusibility. The great volatility of the arsenic, particularly when in contact with charcoal, gave reason to hope that the whole of it, by proper management, might be driven off, leaving the platina behind in a mass, and retaining its peculiar and characteristic properties. In this way different chemists succeeded in forming, of this alloy, crucibles and other chemical utensils, which were found to be less fusible than silver, and were capable of resisting many of the common chemical agents. The most successful method of rendering platina malleable, and working it by means of this alloy, was discovered by Jeanety, a Parisian silversmith, who long directed his attention to this object. An account of his method has been given by Berthollet and Pelletier, of which the following is an abstract.\n\nThe crude platina being first ground in water, and washed for the purpose of separating the earthy matters, three half pounds of the metal, three pounds of white arsenic, and one pound of pearl ashes, are to be well mixed together. A crucible, capable of holding twenty pounds of this mixture, is then to be placed in a furnace of any convenient construction. When the crucible is thoroughly red-hot, introduce one-third of the mixture, and continue stirring it with a rod of platina till it comes to a state of quiet fusion; then add another one-third, stirring it in the same manner till the fusion is completed, and afterwards add the remaining one-third, and apply a strong heat so that the whole may become very fluid. Then withdraw the crucible, and when it has cooled gradually, break it up; a well formed metallic button will be found in it, covered by blackish brown scoriae, which has a considerable action on the magnetic needle. The button, which is very brittle, being broken to pieces, is to be fused again with white arsenic and pearl ashes as before, and the metallic mass obtained from this second fusion is generally found to have no effect on the magnetic needle; but if this should not be the case, a third fusion in the same way becomes necessary.\n\nThe first step of the process is now completed. A flat-bottomed cylindrical crucible, about three inches and a half in diameter, is to be made thoroughly hot in a furnace, and charged with one pound and a half of the arsenicated platina, mixed with an equal weight of white arsenic, and one half pound of pot-ash; and when this mixture\nmixture has been completely fluid, the crucible is to be removed from the fire, and allowed to cool in a horizontal position, that the thickness of the cake of metal may be uniform. When the crucible is cold, it is to be carefully broken, and the scoria being removed, a cake of metal is obtained, well-formed and porous, weighing three ounces more than the arsenicated platinum employed. The metal is now quite saturated with arsenic. It has been observed, that there is no inconvenience from incorporating too much arsenic, for it would appear that the full success and rapidity of the purification of the platinum, are exactly in proportion to the quantity of arsenic with which it has previously combined.\n\nThe mass of metal thus obtained, is placed in a muffle, and the heat is gradually increased, till the evaporation of the arsenic commences; after which the temperature is to be kept up as nearly as possible at the same degree, for the space of six hours, carefully watching not to increase it, lest the cake should be brought to a state of fusion. At the end of the six hours, the cake has usually become considerably porous; it is then to be withdrawn, and extinguished in common oil; after which it is returned to the muffle, by which means a further quantity of arsenic is drawn off; and this alternate heating and application of oil are to be continued till the arsenic no longer makes its appearance. In proportion as the arsenic is driven off, the fusibility of the mass diminishes, so that a greater degree of heat may be applied in the latter stage of the process. After having carefully burnt off at a high degree of heat the whole of the charcoal which is produced by the decomposition of the oil, the spongy cake of metal is to be digested in nitrous acid, and then edulcorated by repeated boiling in water. Three or more of the cakes are then to be placed in a crucible, and exposed to the highest degree of heat in a powerful furnace, and while they are thus rendered soft, an iron pestle let down upon them, will make them cohere; and being withdrawn from the crucible, they are to be heated to the utmost in a smith's fire, and carefully forged like iron on the anvil, into compact bars.\n\nThe cheapness of the process now detailed is the only advantage which it holds out, for the platinum does not require to be previously dissolved in nitric acid; but it is to be observed, that the metal by this treatment is by no means perfectly pure; a small portion of arsenic and iron still adhering to it, and probably some lead and copper, which may have been accidentally mixed with the ore, while it contains the whole of the palladium, osmium, iridium, and rhodium; and thus contaminated, it is obvious, that it must be less capable of resisting the action of alkalies, and high degrees of heat without injury, than when it is brought to a state of greater purity. Accordingly, other processes for the purification of this valuable metal, have been contrived and practised.\n\nThe following is the process proposed by Count Mouffin Poufikin, to render platinum malleable. 1. Precipitate the platinum from its solution by muriate of ammonia, and wash the precipitate with a little cold water.\n\n2. Reduce it in a convenient crucible to the well-known spongy metallic texture, which wash two or three times with boiling water to carry off any portion of saline matter which may have escaped the action of the fire.\n\n3. Boil it for about half an hour in as much water, mixed with one-tenth part of muriatic acid, as will cover the mass to the depth of about half an inch, in a convenient glass vessel. This will carry off any quantity of iron that might still exist in the metal.\n\n4. Decant the acid water, and edulcorate or strongly ignite the platinum.\n\n5. To one part of this metal take two parts of mercury, and amalgamate in a glass or porphyry mortar. This amalgamation takes place very readily. The proper method of conducting it is to take about two drams of mercury to three drams of platinum, and amalgamate them together; and to this amalgam may be added alternate small quantities of platinum and mercury till the whole of the two metals are combined. Several pounds may be thus amalgamated in a few hours, and in the large way a proper mill might shorten the operation.\n\n6. After the amalgam is completely produced, it must be quickly moulded in bars or plates, or any other forms that may be preferred; taking care that these moulded pieces should at least be half an inch in thickness, and of a proper length to manage them afterwards in the fire; it is also requisite that the mould should be perfectly even and smooth. Half an hour after the pieces are formed they begin to harden by the oxidation of the mercury, and change their brilliant metallic colour for a dull leaden one.\n\n7. As soon as the pieces have acquired a proper degree of hardness to be handled without danger of breaking, which commonly takes place in a little more than an hour, place them in a proper furnace, and keep them ignited under a muffle or in a small reverberatory. No other precaution is necessary in this operation, but that of not breaking the pieces during their transport. The mercury flies off during the heat, and the platinum remains perfectly solid; so that, after being strongly ignited two or three times before the bellows, it may be forged, or laminated in the same manner as gold or silver; care being taken, at the commencement of the forging, or of passing it between rollers, not to apply too great a force till the metal has acquired all its density. It is almost superfluous to add, that in evaporating the mercury from large quantities of amalgam, a proper apparatus, such as in the silver amalgamation, must be employed to receive the volatilized mercury; but for small quantities, where the loss of this metal is of no consequence, the furnace must have a proper chimney to carry off the metallic vapours. When the platinum comes out of the first fire, its dimensions are about two thirteenth parts smaller every way than the original amalgam from the mould. The whole of this operation seems to be governed by the prelure of the atmosphere and the laws of cohesive attraction: for the air is driven out from between the molecules of the platinum, which by their solution in mercury are most probably in their primitive and consequently uniform figure. It is very visible, and at the same time a very amusing phenomenon to observe, (during the process of ignition, which is performed in four or five minutes) how the platinum contracts every way into itself, as if prelured by some external force.\"\n\nThe count then adds, \"that, as soon as my amalgam of mercury is made, I compress the same in tubes of wood, by the pressure of an iron screw upon a cylinder of wood, adapted to the bore of the tube. This forces out the superabundant mercury from the amalgam, and renders\nrenders it solid. After two or three hours I burn upon the coals, or in a crucible lined with charcoal, the sheath in which the amalgam is contained, and urge the fire to a white heat; after which I take out the platina in a very solid state, fit to be forged.*\n\nA simpler method for rendering platina malleable, and at the same time not less effectual, has been proposed by Mr Knight. The following is an account of this method in the words of the author.\n\n\"To a given quantity of crude platina I add fifteen times its weight of nitro-muriatic acid (composed of equal parts of nitric and muriatic acids) in a tubulated glass retort, with a tubulated receiver adapted to it. It is then boiled, by means of an Argand's lamp, till the acid has assumed a deep yellow colour: it is then poured off; and if any platina remain undissolved, more acid is added, and it is again boiled until the whole is taken up. The liquor, being filtered to rest till quite clear, is again decanted: a solution of sal-ammoniac is then added, by little and little, till it no longer gives a cloudiness. By this means the platina is thrown down in the form of a lemon-coloured precipitate, which having subsided, the liquor is poured off, and the precipitate repeatedly washed with distilled water till it ceases to give an acid taste; (too much water is injurious, the precipitate being in a certain degree soluble in that liquid): the water is then poured off, and the precipitate evaporated to dryness.\n\n\"So far my process is in a great measure similar to that which some others have also followed; but my method of managing the subsequent, and which are indeed the principal manipulations, will be found to possess many advantages over any that has yet been made public. The best process hitherto followed has been, to give the precipitate a white heat in a crucible, which in some measure agglutinates the particles; and then to throw the mass into a red-hot mortar, or any similar implement, and endeavour to unite them by using a pestle or flamer. But the mass is so spongy that it is hardly possible to get a single stroke applied to it before the welding heat is gone; and though by peculiar dexterity and address some have in this way succeeded, it has been found to require such innumerable heatings and hammerings, that most of those who have attempted it, have either failed entirely, or given it up as being too laborious and expensive. I have succeeded in obviating all these difficulties by adopting the following simple, easy, and expeditious method:\n\n\"A strong, hollow, inverted cone of crucible earth being procured, with a corresponding stopper to fit it, made of the same materials, the point of the latter is cut off about three-fourths from the base. The platina, now in the state of a light yellow powder, is pressed tight into the cone, and, a cover being fixed lightly on, it is placed in an air furnace, and the fire raised gradually to a strong white heat. In the mean time the conical flopper, fixed in a pair of iron tongs suitable for the purpose, is brought to a red or to a bright red heat. The cover being then removed from the cone, the tongs with the heated flopper is introduced through a hole in the cover of the furnace, and pressed at first gently on the platina, at this time in a state nearly as soft as dough, till it at length acquires a more solid consistence. It is then repeatedly struck with the flopper, as hard as the nature of the materials will admit, till it appears to receive no farther impression. The cone is then removed from the furnace, and being struck lightly with a hammer, the platina falls out in a metallic button, from which state it may be drawn, by repeatedly heating and gently hammering, into a bar fit for flatting, drawing into wire, planishing, &c.\n\n\"Besides the comparative facility of this process, it has the farther advantage of rendering the platina much purer than when red-hot iron is obliged to be had recourse to; for platina, when of a white heat, has a strong affinity for iron, and, with whatever care it may have been previously separated from that metal, will be found to have taken up a portion of it, when it is employed of a red heat, to serve to unite the particles of the platina. To the superior purity of platina, rendered malleable by the process before described, I attribute the greater specific gravity which I find it to possess, than that prepared by other methods. Having taken the specific gravity of about ten pennyweights of it, which I had previously passed repeatedly through a flatting mill, I found it to be 22.26+.\"\n\nAnother method, which has been successfully practised, was contrived by Mr Cock. The following is an account of his process. After the solution of the platina in nitro-muriatic acid, the liquor is filtered through clean sand, for the purpose of separating the black powder which floats in it. The clear solution is then decomposed by means of sal ammoniac; the yellow precipitate being collected, is to be moderately well washed in warm water and dried; and being distributed into faucets placed in a small oven, constructed for the purpose, in which they are to be exposed for a short time to a low red heat, that the platina may be brought to the metallic state, and the greater part of the sal ammoniac may be sublimed. When the platina, after this treatment, is withdrawn, it is in the form of a gray coloured, spongy mass; and in this state half an ounce of it is to be put into a strong iron mould, one inch and a half wide, and two and a half long. It is then to be compressed as strongly as possible, by striking with a mallet upon a wooden pestle accurately cut to fit the mould; another half ounce is then added, and treated in the same manner, till five ounces have been forced into the mould: a loose iron cover, just capable of sliding down the mould, is then laid upon the platina. This part of the process requires particular care; for if any material quantity of air be left in the mass, the bar into which it is formed is extremely apt to scale and be full of flaws in the subsequent operations. The pressure being properly made, the mould is to be taken to pieces, and the platina will be found in the form of a dense compact parallelopiped. It is next to be placed in a forge fire of charcoal, and heated to the most intense white heat, in order to drive off the muriate of ammonia which remains: this being done, it is to be quickly placed on a clear bright anvil, and gently hammered in every direction by a clean hammer. This is several times to be repeated, at the end of which the mass will be perfectly compact, and fit to be laminated or wrought in any other manner at the pleasure of the artist. It is to be observed, that while the platina is heating, it must be loose in the fire, for if it were held by the tongs, they would infallibly become welded to the platina, and by this means greatly damage it. When the platina is thus drawn down to a compact bar, it will be covered by a semivitreous crust, somewhat...\nsomewhat reddish, chiefly proceeding from particles of the ashes melted down upon it, and extended by the hammer over its surface. To remove this, the bar, after being made red hot, is to be sprinkled over with glaas of borax reduced to powder, and then kept at a white heat for a few minutes; it is to be plunged into diluted muriatic acid when moderately cool, by which the borax and other vitreous matters will be dissolved, and the platina with a perfectly clean white surface left behind.\n\n* Aikin's Dict. of Chem. &c. ii. 233.\n\nCHAP. II. Of the Ores of Gold.\n\nGold exists in nature only in the metallic state; but it is scarcely ever found perfectly pure, for it is alloyed in different proportions with silver, copper, tellurium, and some other metals. When it is alloyed with silver or copper, or even with both, the gold retains its ductility; but when combined with tellurium, its distinctive characters entirely disappear.\n\nSECT. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Gold.\n\nThe method of analyzing gold ores is very simple. The principal difficulty with which it is attended arises from the small proportion of this metal contained in the greater part, even of those ores which are considered as very rich. Native gold contains invariably, but generally in small proportion, silver or copper, and sometimes both, and the gangue is often a very hard quartz. In this case the following is an approved mode of proceeding. Reduce the ore to fine powder, mix it with five times its weight of carbonate of soda, or, what answers better, with four parts of carbonate of soda, and one of glaas of borax: put the mixture into an earthen crucible, and melt it. Pour out the fused mass on a stone slab, and detach the small portion remaining in the crucible by means of a little diluted muriatic acid. Reduce the mass to coarse powder; put it into a flask with the muriatic solution; add strong muriatic acid, and apply a gentle heat. Continue the digestion, adding from time to time a little nitrous acid, till no farther action is produced, and the undissolved residue becomes of a pure white colour. Then pour off the liquor, wash the residue, and add the washings to the liquor.\n\n1. After the insoluble residue is dried, expose it to the sun, and if it contain any muriate of silver, it will assume a purplish colour. When this is the case, let it be mixed with three times its weight of pearl ash, and fused in an earthen crucible for five minutes. The silver will thus be reduced to metallic globules, and will be obtained pure by digesting it in muriatic acid, which combines with the earth and alkali, but does not act on the silver.\n\n2. The nitro-muriatic solution is now to be carefully neutralized by means of soda or of potash; and a solution of green sulphate of iron is to be added, as long as any precipitate is formed. The precipitate thus obtained is gold, and this being carefully collected, is to be fused in a small crucible with nitre just in sufficient quantity to cover its surface.\n\n3. The residual liquor, after being decomposed by the carbonate of an alkali, and the precipitate being well washed, is to be digested in liquid ammonia, to dissolve the copper. The ammoniacal solution being slightly super-\n\nsaturated with muriatic acid, a rod of zinc being introduced, will precipitate the copper in the metallic state.\n\nAuriferous pyrites. It appears that iron pyrites of a bronze yellow colour in masses, or in striated cubes, and hepatic pyrites, which are found in veins in primitive mountains, contain a quantity of pure gold, or of gold alloyed with silver, which is worth the trouble and expense of extracting it. A considerable proportion, not only of the American, but also of the Hungarian gold, is obtained from ore of this kind. The produce of the latter sometimes does not exceed a few grains of gold in the quintal, but occasionally the auriferous pyrites of the Hungarian mines yield not less than 450 ounces of gold in the quintal of the ore.\n\nThe following is the method of analysis to be followed in ores of this kind. The pyrites being reduced to powder, is digested in muriatic acid, occasionally adding a small portion of nitric acid, till everything soluble is taken up. The residue, after being well washed and dried, is to be weighed, and exposed to a heat which is just sufficient to burn off the sulphur, the quantity of which is indicated by the loss of weight. The residue is again to be digested in nitro-muriatic acid, and this solution is to be added to the first. The earthy residue, which contains the silver in the state of muriate, is then to be fused with an equal weight of glaas of borax, and three times the quantity of pearl ash. By this process the silver is reduced and may be separated from the alkali and the earth by means of muriatic acid very much diluted. The nitro-muriatic solution is to be neutralized by a fixed alkali, and if it be afterwards treated with nitrate of mercury prepared in the cold, the gold will be thrown down in the state of a brown powder. It may be reduced to the metallic state by fusing it with nitre. The oxide of iron which remains in solution, may be obtained in the usual way in the state of magnetic oxide.\n\nAuriferous galena.—Galena, or the native sulphuret of lead, almost always contains a small portion of silver, and very often it is in such quantity as to be worth the trouble of extracting it. Galena sometimes has also combined with it a little gold as well as silver, and it is worked as one of the ores of gold. This is the case with some of the galena of Hungary, as that of Boicza yields 1½ oz. of alloy in the quintal, of which 31 parts are silver, and one of gold.\n\nThe analysis of auriferous galena is to be conducted nearly in the same way as the auriferous pyrites. The pulverized ore being digested in nitro-muriatic acid, the gold and the lead, and, if any are present, the iron and antimony, are taken up; leaving behind the earthy matters, as well as the sulphur and silver, which may be separated according to the method employed in the former process. By gradually evaporating the nitro-muriatic solution, a crystallized muriate of lead is obtained; and by again diluting the solution with water, the gold may be separated by adding nitrate of mercury.\n\nThe analysis of the ores of gold containing tellurium, will be given under the head of that metal.\n\nSECT. II. Reduction of the Ores of Gold.\n\nMany of the most profitable veins of gold are of trifling magnitude, but at the same time yield ample returns to the miner, although they are mixed with fo large\nlarge a proportion of stony matter and other impurities as would render the working of any other metal altogether unprofitable. This obviously arises from the great commercial importance of gold compared with other metals, which no doubt is owing as well to its rarity as to its peculiar properties. In the Hungarian gold mines, which are the richest yet known in the old continent, the attention of the miner is not merely limited to the strings of ore, but to the whole contents of the vein, which are usually extracted and raised to the surface in large masses. These masses are distributed to the workmen, who break them down, first with large hammers, and afterwards with smaller ones, till they are reduced to pieces of the size of a walnut. In the course of this process, every piece is carefully examined, and arranged according to its value. The smallest visible grain of native gold is separated from the quartz in which it is chiefly imbedded, and put by itself. The auriferous pyrites and galena are also put into separate heaps; even the finest splinters that are detached in breaking down the masses, and the sand and mud of the mine, are all collected, washed, and sifted, and arranged according to their apparent richness. What has been rejected in the first examination, is re-examined by boys, whose labour is not of great value, and who pick out almost the whole that has been overlooked by the men, and arrange it in the same manner.\n\nThe native gold with the matrix attached to it, is again to be broken by hand into still smaller pieces, by which means other impurities and stony matters are separated. The ore is then introduced into a wooden box floored with cast-iron plates; and by the action of two or more heavy hammers of oak, which are loaded with iron, and alternately worked like the common stamping mill, it is reduced to a fine powder. This powder, which is called flour, is then removed into a vessel like a large basin, and is mixed with such a quantity of salt and water as will render it damp. The workman then takes a thin porous leather bag, introduces a quantity of mercury into it, and by a regular and continued pressure forces the mercury in very minute drops through the leather. In this divided state it falls upon the pulverized ore, and is immediately kneaded up with it, till the requisite quantity, which depends on the proportion of gold, has been added. After completing this part of the process, the next object is to incorporate the mercury and the gold. This is effected by rubbing the mixture together for some time by means of a wooden pestle. The mixture is then heated in a proper vessel, and subjected for three or four days, to the temperature of boiling water; and, lastly, the mixture is to be carefully washed by small parcels at a time, so that the earthy particles may be carried off by the water. The mercury combined with the gold, only remains behind, in the form of amalgam. A portion of this mercury is then separated by pressure in a leathern bag, and the remainder is driven off by distillation, leaving behind the gold and silver with which it may be alloyed.\n\nBut a more complicated process is requisite in separating that portion of the gold which is invisibly dispersed in the pyrites, in galena, and other metallic substances, as well as the stony parts of the matrix. In the treatment and sorting already described, these ores are separated, not only according to their apparent richness, but they are arranged also according to the degrees of hardness. They are then carried to the stamping mill, of which the principal parts are, 1. The coffers or cisterns, in which the ore is reduced to powder, and through which a stream of water continually passes, and so managed as to be increased or diminished at pleasure; 2. The tampers, or vertical beams, which are loaded with iron; and 3. The axle, which is fixed horizontally, and one end of which works in a pivot, while the other is riveted into the centre of a large water wheel. The mode of action of this apparatus is obvious. A stream of water falls upon the wheel, and turns it round, as well as the axle to which it is attached. The cogs, which are fastened to the axle, alternately raise the tampers to a given height, and then let them fall upon the ore placed in the coffers. And as the ore is sufficiently broken, it is carried by the stream of water continually passing through, out at the sides of the coffer into the labyrinths, where the stony and metallic contents of the ore are deposited, according to their specific gravity, nearer to or at a greater distance from the aperture. The coffer is a rectangular hole sunk below the level of the ground, and it is about five feet in length, two feet and sometimes less in width, and four feet deep. Five tampers are employed, they are strong oaken beams loaded with iron, and weighing about 200 pounds each. They are placed side by side, at the distance of about 2½ inches from each other.\n\nWhen the ore is to be pounded, the first thing is to cover the bottom of the coffer with a flooring or pavement, composed of large pieces of the hardest and poorest part of the vein. These pieces are to be closely fitted together, and a floor of this kind is found to answer better than an iron floor. The thickness of the floor is to be proportioned according to the degree of hardness of the ore to be pounded; for it is obvious that the higher it is, the smaller will be the space through which the tampers fall; and their momentum will therefore be proportionally diminished. One precaution must be invariably observed, that the part of the floor immediately under the middle tamper be about two inches lower than that below the tamper on each side, and that this again be an inch lower than that beneath the two outermost tampers.\n\nAfter the coffer is thus prepared, the machinery is set in motion, a small stream of water being allowed to flow into the coffer. The ore is to be carefully thrown in, just below the middle tamper, or the proper quantity is supplied by means of a hopper. The ore being thus broken down by the middle tamper, is gradually delivered to the tampers on each side, where it is still farther reduced to powder, and from them it passes on to the two outermost tampers, where it is reduced to such a degree of fineness as to be for a time suspended in the water, and carried along with the stream through the openings at the ends of the coffer.\n\nIn stamping the ores of gold and silver, great attention is necessary, that no pieces of ore be subjected to the process that can be conveniently separated from the gangue by the hand; and that the ore be reduced to a coarse or fine powder, according to its nature. When native gold is dispersed in minute particles, in a hard fibrous matrix, it is found impossible to separate the whole of the metal, unless it be very finely pulverized; and in this case the ore may be reduced to fine powder, both on account of the great difference of the specific gravity of the two ingredients of the ore, and also because the fibrous particles, however minute, acquire no degree of tenacity, so as to adhere to the particles of gold. In\n\nVol. XV. Part II,\nflampping ores of this kind, therefore, the coffers may be let very low, that the flamppers may have the greater power, and a small stream of water only may be let in, that the current which passes out may carry with it only the smaller particles. But when the gold is dispersed in an indurated and ochreous clay, or in calcareous spar; if the ore in this case be not finely pulverized, a great proportion of the metal will be retained in the earthy matrix; and if the flamping be continued too long, the whole will be brought to a fluid mud, which will prevent the subsidence of the particles of gold. In the management of this part of the process, no small degree of skill and experience is requisite, to obtain the greatest produce of gold.\n\nThe reduction of the ore to grains of a uniform size, greatly facilitates the washing which follows the flamping, and yields a greater product of metal. This is effected by taking care that the ore, when first introduced into the coffer, shall fall under the middle flampus, and also by the velocity of the water wheel being properly regulated. When the motion of the flampus is too slow, loss of time is the only consequence; but when the motion is greatly accelerated, the water is violently thrown about, carrying with it to the apertures at the end of the coffer, pieces of the ore that are not sufficiently comminuted.\n\nThe ore being reduced to particles of a sufficient degree of fineness to be carried by the force of the water out of the coffer, passes into shallow channels of different dimensions. These channels or troughs, the whole series of which is called a labyrinth, are constructed of wood or stone, and communicate with each other at the extremities. The various parts of the ore are deposited in these channels, according to their specific gravities; the heaviest particles are detained in the first, and the lightest are carried along, and subside in the last and lowest. Each of the channels has a groove at its lowest extremity, and thus admits of being closed at pleasure by pieces of wood about an inch in height, which slide down upon each other. By varying the rapidity of the current through the channels, the heavy particles can be more accurately separated from the lighter ones, which is done by diminishing the slope, and increasing the width and length of the channels.\n\nBut with whatever care the first operation of the washing may be conducted, it is by no means sufficient to separate the whole of the sand from the ore. A second washing on tables, as they are called, is requisite. These tables are long wooden planes, which are considerably inclined, and are crofted at regular distances by narrow shallow grooves. A long wicker basket, or perforated wooden trough, filled with the washed ore, is fixed to the upper extremity of the table, and a small stream of water is admitted, which passing between the twigs of the basket, carries with it particles of the ore. These particles are either carried by the current off the table, or are deposited, according to their specific gravity, in the grooves, the heaviest particles subsiding first. In this way the auriferous ores of iron and copper pyrites, galena, &c. are sufficiently separated from the quartz and other stony matter, to be fit for the furnace; but for the ores of native gold, a third washing is necessary. This is performed in small quantities at a time, in a wooden vessel resembling in shape a common fire shovel without a handle, but having the sides more elevated, and being furnished with two ears, by which it is held during the operation. The ore is put into this vessel, which is gently immersed in water, and a circular motion is communicated to it by a peculiar dexterity, which can only be acquired by practice. By this motion in the water the lighter particles are gradually thrown out of the vessel, and scarcely anything remains behind but the gold, which is either amalgamated or fused with the addition of a little nitre, in an earthen crucible. Here it may be added, that the separation of the gold which is found in alluvial soil, or in the sands of rivers, is conducted precisely in the same way, only that it is not necessary to be subjected to the process of flamping previous to washing.\n\nThe produce of the proper auriferous ores is seldom of sufficient value to admit of the same attention in washing as native gold; and therefore it is always found, after this operation, mixed with a considerable proportion of earthy matters. When the metallic part is composed of pyrites, which is frequently the case, it may be useful, previous to the fusion of the ore, to give it a moderate roasting, for the purpose of expelling the greater part of the sulphur; but it must be observed, that this process is to be regulated by the quantity, and refractory nature of the stony part of the ore; because the sulphur in the subsequent fusion acts the part of a flux, and therefore the cleaner the ore, the more perfectly it may be roasted. This part of the process being completed, a little quicklime, as a flux, is added, and carefully mixed with the ore, and a portion of galena, according to the proportion of gold and silver contained in the pyrites, previously discovered by assaying it. This mixture is next to be introduced into a reverberatory furnace, which is to be raised to a red heat; and when the mixture begins to clot together, it is to be stirred from time to time, and kept at a temperature inferior to that of fusion, till part of the sulphur is expelled; and when this is accomplished, the fire is to be increased, so that the whole may be brought to a state of thin fusion, after which it is let out in the usual way, and received in a mould of sand. During the process of fusion, the iron having a very strong affinity for sulphur, recombines with that portion of which it had been deprived by the roasting; in consequence of the decomposition of the sulphurets of lead and copper with which it is mixed; and these metals, by their specific gravity, fall in drops through the vitreous ferruginous scoriae, and carry with them the gold and silver, with which they unite at the bottom into a dense mass of metal. Thus it happens that the pig formed in the mould consists of two parts, which adhere to each other, but may be easily separated by the hammer. The superior and the larger portion, is a cellular mass of scoria, and the lower is a black, heavy, compact mass, containing the gold and silver, along with lead, copper, and a portion of sulphur and iron. It is again broken into pieces, and roasted and fused once or twice, till the whole of the sulphur and other impurities are separated, and nothing remains but the metallic substances.\n\nIn the farther treatment of the ores of gold, the object of the refiner is to separate it from the metallic substances with which it is alloyed. We shall now mention the different methods which are followed in separating the metals from gold with which it is usually alloyed.\n\n1. Separation.\n1. Separation of gold from platina.—As platina, like gold itself, is not susceptible of oxidation by exposure to heat and air, it cannot be separated by the process of cupellation; and platina having as little affinity for sulphur as gold itself, that substance, or the sulphurated metals, cannot be successfully employed for this purpose. It has been found that mercury combines more readily with gold than with platina, and from the knowledge of this circumstance a method has been devised of separating these metals. When the proportion of platina is so large, that the mass is brittle, it must be reduced to powder in a mortar; but if it be ductile, it may be reduced to small pieces by granulation. A quantity of mercury equal to seven or eight times the weight of the alloy, is then to be heated in an iron crucible, and raised to the boiling point. The alloy being first made red hot, is to be dropped in, and the whole kept for half an hour nearly at the same temperature. The mixture is then emptied into an iron mortar, and being covered with hot water, is to be carefully triturated for some hours, the water being renewed from time to time. In this way the gold combines with the mercury, and a considerable proportion of the platina will rise to the surface of the amalgam in the state of a black powder, which may be easily scraped off. In this way the alloy is to be purified as much as possible, and the superfluous mercury may be separated by draining through leather, and the amalgam deprived of the remaining mercury by the process of distillation. The gold, which still holds a small quantity of platina, is now to be melted with three times its weight of silver; and the mixture being granulated, is to be parted by means of nitrous acid. It has been found (although it be a singular circumstance) that pure platina, or even when mixed with gold, is perfectly insoluble in this acid; but, when combined with a large proportion of silver, it is readily dissolved, and the solution is of a dark yellowish brown colour; and, therefore, by digesting this triple alloy of gold, platina, and silver, in nitrous acid, the silver and platina are dissolved, and the gold remains behind. But it may be necessary to ascertain whether the whole of the platina be separated. This is done by melting a few grains of the gold, after careful washing, with three times their weight of silver, and treating it as before with nitrous acid. If it contain one half per cent, or even a smaller proportion of platina, the acid will be perceptibly coloured, and this being the case, the process must be repeated again on the whole mass. But this is rarely necessary when the previous trituration with mercury has been carefully performed. By adding to the remaining nitrous solution, a solution of common salt, the silver will be precipitated, leaving the platina in the solution.\n\nBy the following method, which is still more comprehensive, gold may be separated from platina. The alloy is dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, and the gold is precipitated by means of carbonate of soda, or a large quantity of green sulphate of iron, neither of which has the effect of decomposing the solution of platina. The precipitated gold being dried, and mixed with a little borax and nitre, is subjected to fusion, after which it will be found in a state of perfect purity.\n\n2. Separation of gold from silver.—In ores in which the proportion of gold is small, the silver may be conveniently separated by means of sulphur. The alloy is first melted, and granulated, by pouring it into cold water, which is kept in constant agitation with a rod or wicker brush. From an eighth to a fifth of the granulated metal is reserved, and the remainder is carefully mixed with about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of its weight of powdered sulphur, which adheres readily to the moist grains. The mixture is introduced into a covered crucible, and kept for some time at a gentle heat, that the metal may be completely penetrated by the sulphur, after which the heat is increased till the whole mass is brought into fusion. This sulphuret of silver becomes a tough, viscous fluid, which retains the particles of gold, and prevents them from subsiding. The mass being kept in fusion for about an hour, that the union of the sulphur and silver may be completed, and any excess may be burnt off, a third part of the reserved silver in grains is to be added, and when it is melted, is to be stirred with a wooden rod, that it may be accurately mixed with the other materials, and brought into contact with the gold, with which it immediately enters into combination. The fusion being continued another hour, a similar quantity of grained silver is to be added, and after a third hour has elapsed, the remaining third is introduced, and treated in the same manner. The crucible, which is now to be kept carefully covered, is to be exposed to a high temperature for three hours, while the melted mass is stirred from the bottom every half hour. At the end of this time the surface of the mass, instead of being dark brown, becomes whitish as the sulphur escapes, and some bright white drops of melted silver, about the size of peas, make their appearance. The fused mass is now to be poured into a greased cone; and when it is cold, it will be found to be composed of a mass of sulphuret of silver, resting upon a white metallic button, which is nearly equal in weight to the added silver, and contains the whole of the gold that originally existed in the entire mass. If it appears that any of the gold remains among the sulphuret of silver, it may be separated by fusion in an open crucible. By this process part of the sulphur is burnt off, and a corresponding quantity of silver is reduced to the metallic state, which being carefully mixed with the remainder, and repeatedly stirred with a piece of flint, the whole of the gold remaining in the silver, which is still sulphurated, will be attracted; and by being poured into a cone, will be collected at the bottom in a mass.\n\nThe silver containing the gold, which is collected in these two operations, being melted and granulated, is subjected to one or more repetitions of the same process, till the silver that remains is found to contain a sufficient proportion of gold, to render it worth while to proceed to the process of parting by means of aquafortis. The whole of the silver may be separated by means of sulphur; but when the proportion of gold is considerable, the sulphuret of silver always takes up a part of it, which cannot again be entirely separated without repeated fusions; and therefore, when the gold is equal to \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the silver, a further purification by means of sulphur, will scarcely be found advantageous.\n\nAn ingenious and economical method of separating the gold from old gilt silver lace or wire, has been extensively practised in Saxony. This method proceeds on the principle, that the affinity of gold for copper, and of silver for lead, is much greater than the affinity which subsists between gold and silver; and it is con-\nducted in the following manner. The alloyed metal is first granulated, and \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) of it is mixed with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) its weight of litharge, and \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of fandiver. This is called the precipitating mixture. The next is mixed with \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of powdered sulphur, and is brought into fusion, which being complete, as will appear from the flashing at the surface, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the precipitating mixture is added at three different times, allowing an interval of five minutes between each time; and the fusion is then continued for ten minutes longer. Part of the sulphurated silver is taken out with a small crucible made red hot, and the remainder being poured into the melting cone, a quantity of metallic silver combined with the greatest part of the gold, subsides to the bottom. The sulphuret of silver is again melted, and the remaining part of the precipitating mixture is added as at first, and thus a second portion of gold alloyed with silver is obtained. But as the sulphuret still retains a small portion of gold, it is to be fused a third time; and a precipitating mixture, equal in weight to the former, but consisting of an alloy of equal parts of copper and lead, is to be added, and thus a third precipitate of gold holding silver is obtained, and the sulphuret is now deprived of the whole of its gold.\n\nThe different metallic masses thus obtained, are melted with \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of lead, then granulated, and treated in the same way as at first, with sulphur and the precipitating mixtures. The silver thus obtained being rich in gold, is first to be granulated, then mixed with \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) of sulphur, and kept in fusion for about half an hour without any addition; and being poured into a cone, the sulphuret is separated from the metal, and this last is treated two or three times more with sulphur, in a similar manner. The metallic button obtained, which now appears of a yellow colour, is to be melted with one sixteenth of copper, then granulated, and mixed with one sixteenth of sulphur; and the mixture being first gently heated in a covered crucible, and kept in fusion for about a quarter of an hour, is poured into a cone, at the bottom of which the gold is collected of a bright colour, and about eighteen carats fine. The purification is afterwards completed by means of sulphuret of antimony, a process which will be afterwards described.\n\n3. Parting operation.—When the proportion of the gold and silver, alloyed together, is such, that the former is not much less than one sixteenth, or greater than one fourth of the whole mass, the operation of parting may be followed. In this method the gold is separated from the silver by means of diluted nitric acid, or, as it is termed by manufacturers, aquafortis, which dissolves the silver, and leaves the gold untouched. The button of gold and silver is prepared for this process by flattening with the hammer, again heating it red hot, and slowly cooling to anneal it for the purpose of increasing its malleability. It is then to be extended into a small plate as thin as a wafer, by passing it between rollers of polished steel, again heated, but only to redness, and laid off all rolled up in the form of a small loose coil or spiral, called a cornet. The annealing is useful in allowing the metal to be rolled up without cracking, and at the same time the freer action of the acid, in consequence of the texture of the metal being somewhat opened.\n\nThe cornet thus prepared is introduced into a pear-shaped matras, called a parting-glas, and three or four times its weight of pure nitric acid of 1.25 specific gravity are added; the mouth being slightly covered to keep out the dust, the glas is set on a sand bath, or over charcoal, to boil. As soon as it becomes warm, the acid begins to act on the silver, and dissolves it with the evolution of nitrous fumes. During the whole action of the acid, the cornet appears all over fludded with minute bubbles, and when these discontinue, or run into one another, forming a few large ones, the action of the acid is nearly over. The process is usually completed in about fifteen or twenty minutes from the time that the acid begins to boil. The cornet now appears corroded throughout, and has lost during the solution the whole of the silver; and the remaining gold which is slender and brittle, retains the same spiral form. Indeed it is of considerable importance that it should not be broken, for much of the accuracy of the operation depends on having the gold in one piece and not in fragments.\n\nThe acid solution of silver, while yet hot, is next to be carefully poured off, and a portion of fresh acid, somewhat stronger, is to be added, to separate all the remains of silver; the boiling is to be repeated as before, but only for five or six minutes; it is then poured off and added to the former solution, and the parting-glas is filled with hot distilled water, to wash off the remains of the solution. The cornet, which is now of a brown colour and spongy texture, and has little of the metallic appearance, is taken out in the following manner. A small crucible is inverted over the mouth of the parting-glas, while it is yet filled with the distilled water, and the latter being rapidly inverted upon the crucible, the cornet falls softly through the water down the neck of the glas into the crucible, where it is deposited, and the water is carefully poured off. The crucible after being dried is next heated to redness under a muffle. The cornet contracts greatly in all directions, becomes of a firm texture, and resumes its metallic lustre; and after being brought to a red heat and cooled, it exhibits the appearance of a cornet of pure gold, having all the splendour, softness, and flexibility of this precious metal. By accurate weighing, the amount of the product is precisely ascertained, and thus the operation of parting is completed.\n\nBut if the proportion of gold amount to one third of the mass, it combines with part of the silver, and protects the latter by its insolubility from being acted on by the acid, so that in the process of parting, too great a proportion of gold in the alloy must be avoided; and farther, as the acid is expensive, unless the silver be rich in gold, this process, which is in many respects convenient, will not be found economical. In reducing the fineness of the alloy which is too rich in gold to be advantageously parted by itself, it will be the object of the refiner not to employ pure silver, but such as contains a small portion of gold; and at the same time, it will be his study to save the quantity of acid.\n\nThe following is the usual method of conducting the process of parting. After selecting a proper quantity of rich and poor ingots of mixed metal, the whole is to be fused in an iron crucible; and being well mixed by frequent stirring, it is to be removed by a clean iron ladle, and granulated in cold water. The parting glasses, which are nearly of the form of a truncated cone with a rounded bottom, are about twelve inches high and seven inches wide at the lower extremity, and they should be of equal thickness, well annealed, and free from any kind of flaws. About forty ounces of metal are introduced into each glas, and the nitrous acid, half saturat-\nted with silver, is added till it (and two or three fingers breadth above the surface of the metal. Twenty or even more of these glasses are placed in a sand bath, and the heat, which should at first be moderate, is gradually increased till it nearly reach the boiling point about the time that the acid is saturated. The nitrate of silver is poured off, a new portion of stronger acid is added, and boiled as before till it is nearly saturated, when almost the whole of the silver is taken up, and what remains undissolved has the appearance of a brown mud, and consists of the gold finely divided with a small portion of silver. The acid again saturated is poured off, and a third portion of still stronger acid is added, which is kept at the boiling temperature till the evolution of nitrous gas ceases, and the bubbles are enlarged, which shows that all the silver is taken up. The acid is then decanted off, and reserved for the first part of a future process of the same kind; and the gold is repeatedly washed with fresh portions of hot water till the washings dropped on a polished copper plate produce no stain; and the powder, being dried and mixed with a little nitre and borax, is fused, and is then in a state of purity.\n\nTo decompose the nitrate of silver with the view of procuring the pure metal, the solution is poured into a wooden vessel lined with copper, and in which are placed plates of copper that the silver may be precipitated from its solution in consequence of the greater affinity of the nitrous acid for the copper. The surface of the plates is to be cleared from time to time of the silver crust, that a fresh surface of copper may be exposed to the action of the acid, and the decomposition of the nitrate of silver may be promoted; after which the nitrate of copper formed in the solution is decanted off, the plates are scraped, and the silver being washed is fused with nitre, and is also obtained in a state of purity.\n\n4. Separation of gold from silver, or other metals by sulphuret of antimony.—All the common metals, excepting zinc, which come under the denomination of imperfect metals, may be separated from gold by this process; for as gold is incapable of combining with sulphur, and as the affinity of almost all the other metals for sulphur is stronger than that of antimony, it is sufficiently obvious, that an alloy of gold with any of these metals, as for instance gold and copper, being added to sulphuret of antimony, the sulphur will combine with the copper, and the antimony will form an alloy with the gold. When common crucibles are employed for this process, some previous preparation is necessary. A well burned crucible is selected, and soaked for two or three days in linseed oil, which is then to be cleaned away from the inner surface till some finely powdered glass of borax dusted upon it shall just adhere, when it is to be put into a dry place for two or three weeks, after which it is fit for use.\n\nThe gold alloy is first melted in the crucible, and then about twice its weight of coarsely-powdered sulphuret of antimony is thrown in at two or three different times. At each addition the mixture froths and swells up, so that the crucible must be larger than the quantity contained, and great caution must be observed to prevent any bits of charcoal dropping into the crucible; for then the mass of melted matter would certainly flow over. When the mixture begins to sparkle on the surface, and appears to be perfectly fluid, it is to be poured into a melting cone which has been previously heated and greased, and the settling of the gold at the bottom is promoted by communicating a tremulous motion to the cone by means of slight blows. When the matter has become cold, it is removed from the cone by giving it a few blows in an inverted position. The mass is composed of an alloy of gold and antimony covered with scoria consisting of the metal formerly alloyed with the gold now in combination with the sulphur or the antimony. But the gold still retains a little of its alloy, and from this it is to be freed; the same process is to be repeated not only a second, but even a third and fourth time, with a similar quantity of sulphuret of antimony. The metals from which gold may be advantageously purified by this process are iron, copper, tin, lead, and silver.\n\n5. Separation of gold from antimony.—When the proportion of antimony exceeds that of the gold, the alloy is brittle. It must be reduced to small pieces, mixed with one-fourth its weight of sulphur, melted in a covered earthen crucible, and after the fusion is completed, poured into a melting cone previously heated and greased. When examined after being cooled, it will be found to consist of two parts, which may be easily separated by melting the alloy, exposing it to a high temperature, and at the same time directing a stream of air from a pair of bellows into the crucible which contains it. By this means the antimony is oxidated, and driven off in the form of white vapour. The gold having acquired a clear bright green colour, it is to be poured out and melted again in a smaller crucible with a little nitre. The remaining portions of antimony will be oxidated, and driven off from the gold as before. The small proportion of gold which remains attached to the sulphuret of antimony, may be separated by bringing the whole mass into thin fusion, and precipitating part of the antimony by adding about one-fifth of its weight of iron filings. In this way the gold falls down in the form of alloy with the antimony, and it may be separated by means of the process described above.\n\nSeparation of gold from lead by cupellation.—This is the most economical method of separating gold from lead. The nature of the process of cupellation, and the method of conducting it, have been already described under Chemistry, No. 2026, p. 682. But besides lead, other metals may be separated from gold, by employing that metal as a flux, the effects of which in scoriifying and carrying down most of the imperfect metals, are such, that by the process of cupellation with lead, which is to be repeated according to the proportion of the alloy, and its affinity for the gold, almost every particle of the metals combined with it, may be separated. This method is usually followed where the proportion of alloy is but small; but when it is more considerable, some of the other methods are preferable. It is found, however, that in the cupellation of pure gold with lead, it always retains a small portion of this metal, which affects its colour and ductility. But if the alloy to be purified contain, beside lead, to the amount of one-twenty-fourth of the gold of copper, the whole of the lead may be separated, but scarcely any of the copper; and if it contain silver in a greater proportion than that of copper, the latter may be separated by the process of cupellation, and a little of the lead remains. But if the silver exceed...\nexceed the gold, or be equal to it, the copper and lead may be entirely separated, while the gold and silver remain behind. From a knowledge of these facts, the refiners, in separating the base metals from gold, by the process of cupellation, add to the mixture a considerable proportion of silver. When the gold is alloyed with tin, cupellation with lead alone will not succeed, because the tin, with part of the lead, forms a spongy and refractory oxide, and floats on the surface of the fluid metal, and at the same time retains part of the gold. But as iron is found to combine with tin into an alloy that may be scorified by lead, the addition of iron filings during the process removes the difficulty.\n\nThe following table shows the quantity of gold which is got from the different countries of the old and new world, taken on an average, between the years 1790 and 1802.\n\n| Old Continent | Kilogrammes |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Siberia       | 1700        |\n| Africa        | 1500        |\n| Hungary       | 650         |\n| Salzburg      | 75          |\n| Norway        | 75          |\n| Total of the Old Continent | 4000 |\n\n| New Continent | Kilogrammes |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| North America | 1300        |\n| South America |             |\n| Spanish possessions | 5000 |\n| Portuguese possessions | 7500 |\n| Total of the New Continent | 13800 |\n\n* The kilogramme being equal to 2lbs. 3oz. 5drs. avoirdupois, the whole amount is equal to about 39,285 pounds avoirdupois.\n\n**CHAP. III. Of the Ores of Mercury.**\n\nThe ores of mercury present less variety than those of many other metals; and on account of its peculiar properties, the management of its ores, whether for the purposes of analysis or reduction, is less complicated and difficult.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Mercury.**\n\nTo analyze the ore of native mercury, or native amalgam, it is to be digested in nitric acid of moderate strength; the mercury and silver, and bismuth, will be dissolved, and if the ore should contain a minute portion of gold, it will remain untouched in the form of a brown powder at the bottom of the solution. The nitrous solution is next to be gently evaporated till it is so far concentrated as to be on the point of crystallizing. It is then to be poured into a large quantity of pure water, by which means the most part of the bismuth will be separated, and a solution of common salt, or any other neutral muriate, being added to the filtered liquor, the silver and mercury will be precipitated in the form of muriate. After this is separated, add to the clear liquor some carbonated alkali, while any precipitation takes place; then boil the liquor, and separate the precipitate by filtration. The muriatic precipitate is next to be digested in nitro-muriatic acid moderately diluted, which takes up everything excepting the muriate of silver, from which, after being washed and dried, the proportion of silver in the ore may be easily ascertained. The nitro-muriatic solution is now to be decomposed at a boiling heat, by a carbonated alkali, and the white precipitate thus obtained being added to the former carbonated precipitate, mix them with a little oil, or what answers better, sugar, and distill in a small coated glass retort. Raise it gradually to a red heat, and continue at that temperature while any mercury comes over. The residue in the retort consists of a little metallic bismuth and charcoal.\n\n**Native amalgam.**—With the view of ascertaining the proportion of mercury and silver in this ore, Klaproth examined some of the garnet-like crystals from the quicksilver mines of Deux Ponts. Some pure crystals weighing 33½ grains were introduced into a barometer tube of a larger diameter than usual, and closed at the lower end. This end was placed in sand, within a small crucible; heat was applied, and its intensity gradually increased to the degree of ignition. After cooling, he cut off the lower end from the tube, and found that it contained the silver, which had undergone ignition in its former crystalline form, and weighing 12 grains. On collecting the mercury which had been sublimed in the tube, he obtained 21 grains. Therefore since the deficiency of one-third of a grain may be reckoned as a loss of quicksilver, the following will be the proportion of the parts in 100 of this crystallized amalgam of silver.\n\n| Silver | Mercury |\n|--------|---------|\n| 36     | 64      |\n\n**Cinnabar.**—The analysis of cinnabar may be conducted in the following manner. The ore being reduced to a fine powder, is repeatedly digested in a mixture of 1 part of nitric acid, and 3 of muriatic, moderately diluted, by which every thing in the ore is dissolved excepting the siliceous earth and the sulphur. The residue being washed, dried, and weighed, is subjected to a red heat, and the remaining flux being deducted, the difference of weight shows the amount of the sulphur. The nitro-muriatic solution is next to be decomposed at a boiling heat, by carbonated alkali, and the precipitate obtained being mixed with a little lamp-black, and distilled, the mercury passes over in the metallic form. The residue in the retort consists of magnetic oxide of iron, and any accidental earth excepting fluxes that is contained in the ore, together with a little charcoal, which may be separated in the usual way.\n\n**Hepatic ores.**—The hepatic ores of mercury, and such as contain bituminous substances, may be treated in the same way; but these ores are sometimes combined with a little silver, and therefore the matter which remains undigested in nitro-muriatic acid, may be muriate of silver, as well as sulphur and fluxes. When the sulphur is burnt off, the residue is to be mixed with twice its weight of pearl-ash, and being strongly ignited in an earthen crucible, diluted muriatic acid is added, by which the alkali and the earth will be taken up, and\nMercury, the silver will remain behind in the form of small metallic grains.\n\nCorneous ore of mercury.—To analyze this species of mercurial ore, let it be digested in a little distilled vinegar, by which the native mercury which is dispersed though the ore will be left behind. Add to the clear solution nitrate of barytes, by which the sulphuric acid will be separated in the state of sulphate of barytes; and this being removed, drop in nitrate of silver, by which the muriatic acid will be separated in the form of nitrate of silver. The mercury now remains in solution in the state of nitrate, and being precipitated by means of iron, it is afterwards washed in muriatic acid, and thus appears in the metallic state. It may also be reduced to the metallic state by precipitating by carbonated alkali, and distilling the precipitate with a little lamp black.\n\nA simple and easy process is followed in assaying the ore of mercury in the dry way. The ore to be examined is first to be reduced to powder, and carefully mixed with one-fourth of its weight of quicklime, and an equal portion of iron filings. It is then to be exposed to a red heat in an iron or earthen retort, as long as any mercury passes over into the receiver.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Mercury.\n\nA very simple process is followed for reducing the ores of mercury. The following is the method practised at the celebrated mines of Almaden in Spain. The pieces of pure cinnabar are first selected and separated from the ore, to be sold to painters and manufacturers of sealing-wax. The rest is sorted into three parts, of which the first is the richest, and is broken into pieces of a moderate size; the second, containing a smaller proportion of metal, is broken into smaller pieces; and the third consists of the dust and smaller fragments of the other two. These are kneaded up with clay, and being formed into bricks, are carefully dried in the sun. The furnace which is used for extracting the mercury is built in an oblong form, and is divided horizontally by an iron grate, into an upper and lower compartment, and near its top it communicates with a series of aludels. In charging the furnace, a stratum of flat rough stones is placed on the grate, intervals between each of the stones being left for the passage of the fire. A bed of ore of the second quality is laid on the stratum of stones, and then a stratum of the ore of the first quality, after which another of the second kind, and last of all a stratum of the third kind, which has been made up into bricks. A few faggots are then thrown into the lower cavity of the furnace, and lighted up; and a gentle fire is to be kept up by occasionally adding faggots for eight or twelve hours, according to the previous state of the ore with regard to moisture. After the moisture is separated, which is known by the vapour ceasing to be exhaled, the fireplace is filled again with faggots, and by the time they are consumed, a sufficient heat will be communicated to the ore, to allow the combustion to go on, by means of the sulphur which it contains, without requiring any more fuel. In the course of the next two days, while the sulphur burns slowly away, the mercury rises in the state of vapour, and passes into the aludels, where it is condensed. When the whole of the metal is extracted, the scoria is taken out of the furnace, and the aludels are emptied of their contents. But besides the mercury, they are found to contain a quantity of black matter like foot. This matter is easily separated by spreading the whole about on an inclined table, so that the mercury may run to the lower extremity, where it is collected in a channel, and the impure footy matter remains behind.\n\nThe method of extracting mercury from its ores now described, is advantageous, on account of the simplicity of the apparatus, and the smaller expense of fuel; but it would appear that a portion of the mercury remaining in the ore is lost. There is besides a considerable loss in throwing away the foot, after separating the running mercury on the tables, not only because many of the globules of the metal itself are thrown away, but also the calomel, and cinnabar, which are found to be in considerable proportion, are wasted. Hence it has been recommended as a more profitable method, 1. To separate the sulphate of ammonia, which, according to the examination of Prout, forms part of the matter deposited in the aludels, and then by mixing what remains, with 12 or 15 per cent. of quicklime, distill it in an iron retort, by which means the whole of the running mercury would be obtained, as well as that which is produced by the decomposition of the calomel and cinnabar.\n\nA more improved process is practised at the mines of Deux Ponts, and Idria. The ore, as it is brought out of the mine, is carefully sorted by the hand, and these parts that seem destitute of metal, are rejected. This process, although tedious and expensive, is found to be more advantageous than the older method of separating the cinnabar by washing, in which there is a great loss of metal. The ore being thus sorted, it is reduced to powder, and accurately mixed with one-fifth of quicklime, which has fallen to powder by exposing it to the air; but it ought to be observed that the quantity of quicklime is to be regulated by the proportion of cinnabar contained in the ore. The mixture being thus prepared, is introduced into iron retorts, which are capable of holding about 60lbs. weight. The retorts to the number of 40 or 50, are fixed in a long furnace, and a glass receiver is attached to each, but it is not luted. A moderate heat is then applied for the purpose of driving off the whole of the moisture; and when this is done, the joinings of the vessels are to be closely stopp'd with tempered clay, and a full red heat is to be applied, and continued for seven or eight hours, at the end of which time the whole of the mercury will be volatilized, and condensed in the receiver. By this process it is found, that 100lbs of the ore yield from 6oz. to 10oz. of metal.\n\nChap. IV. Of the Ores of Silver.\n\nThe ores of silver present a considerable variety. Sometimes it is found in the metallic state in masses of from 30lbs. to 40lbs. weight, but it is often combined with sulphur in the state of sulphuret; with other metals, especially antimony, arsenic, iron, copper, lead, and bismuth; or with acids, as the carbuncle and the muriatic, forming the carbonate and nitrate of silver. The analysis and reduction of these different ores, it is scarcely necessary to observe, must be conducted according to the\nthe nature and proportion of the ingredients which enter into the composition of the ore to be examined or reduced.\n\nSect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Silver.\n\nWhen a silver ore is to be examined, and the only object in view is to ascertain the proportion of silver it contains, the operation is usually conducted in the dry way. The ore is first roasted and reduced to powder; it is then mixed with litharge in proportion to the earthy matter combined with the ore, and quickly vitrified. The mass thus obtained is again reduced to powder, and being mixed with black flux, is to be fused in a crucible, with a sufficient degree of heat. By this process the lead of the litharge is revived, and collected at the bottom of the crucible, carrying with it the whole of the silver, as well as some of the other metals which may be combined with the ore. The button thus obtained is to be subjected to the process of cupellation, with the requisite quantity of pure lead, and in this way the base metals are scorched, and the silver remains behind in a state of purity, or combined only with the gold, which many of the ores of silver contain in small proportion. The gold is to be separated by some of the methods which we have already described, in treating of the ores of gold. This operation, in which the object only is to ascertain, as in this case, the quantity of silver, is called affaying. In the examination of ores in this view, more affays than one should always be performed, that an accurate and nearly invariable result may be obtained.\n\nBut in examining metallic ores, it is always more satisfactory to ascertain the whole of the ingredients of which they are composed. We shall therefore proceed to give an account of the best conducted analysis of the ores of silver.\n\nCorneous silver ore.—The following is the analysis of this ore by Klaproth.\n\n\"Upon 250 grains of the corneous silver ore I poured three times their weight of pure nitric acid; but no action took place, either in the cold or in the heat of boiling; only a subtle brown red iron-ochre was separated, which, being washed off from the remaining ore, and dried, amounted to four grains. Caustic ammonia, added to the nitric acid employed, precipitated five grains more of iron. When it was afterwards mixed with muriatic acid, only a pale milky colour was produced, but no real corneous silver ore deposited. It followed from this, that neither any free native silver, nor any portion of it mineralized by sulphur, had been contained in that ore. The horn-silver, after treatment with nitric acid, was reduced by twice its weight of salt of tartar, and yielded 133 grains of reguline silver.\n\n\"1. For the purpose of finding out, more accurately, its constituent parts, I mixed 250 grains with 600 grains of the purest alkali prepared from tartar, and brought the mixture into the state of fusion in a glass retort, applying the necessary degree of heat. After refrigeration, I broke off the upper half of the retort, softened the fused mass, which was of a light-brown colour, with hot distilled water, filtered the whole, and edulcorated the residue.\n\n\"2. This residue was then dissolved in nitric acid. The solution acquired a brown tinge, and the scum floating upon the liquor assumed the colour of bricks. When the argentous parts were completely dissolved, there remained 8½ grains of a brown-red powder, which imparted a golden yellow colour to the aqua regia, with which it was digested, and left a white residue behind. This last consisted of horn-silver, mingled with a flight portion of the gangue, or matrix of the ore, and afforded, on reduction, two grains more of silver. Caustic ammonia precipitated from the yellow solution seven grains of oxidized iron.\n\n\"3. The nitric solution of the silver was precipitated by common salt; and the muriat of silver thus obtained weighed, after reduction by means of soda, 134½ grains of reguline silver.\n\n\"4. The fluid, left after the separation of the horn-silver, had a pale-yellow colour, owing to a portion of iron; which, precipitated by pure ammonia, weighed five grains.\n\n\"5. After this, I proceeded to examine the saline mass, dissolved in distilled water, and separated from the silver, after the corneous-ore had been fused with pure alkali. On saturating this mass with distilled vinegar, the solution was rendered turbid, and a loose white earth deposed, which, collected and dried, amounted to three grains and a half of argillaceous earth.\n\n\"6. The alumina being separated, the solution was reduced to a dry salt by evaporation, and the alcohol, affixed upon it, took up the acetite of potash. The neutral salt, which was left behind by this process, and which consisted of the mineralizing muriatic acid and the alkali employed, I dissolved in water, and obtained from it, by repeated evaporation and crystallization, 117½ grains of muriat of potash.\n\n\"7. In order to learn whether and in what proportion sulphuric acid, which by some writers has been mentioned as one of the constituent parts of the corneous silver ore, were really present in it, I again dissolved that salt in distilled water, and dropped into it liquid muriat of barytes. The mixture became turbid, exhibiting that appearance which indicates the presence of only a slight quantity of sulphuric acid. I continued to add the barytes, until no more turbidity appeared. The weight of the precipitate thus obtained was three grains: but, as in these three grains of sulphated barytes the acid cannot properly be estimated to be more than half a grain, I think this quantity is too trifling to be considered as one of the essential constituent parts of the corneous silver ore. But if that half grain of sulphuric acid be estimated equal to 1¼ grain of sulphur of potash, and be subtracted from the above 117½ grains of digestive salt, or muriat of potash, there will remain of the latter only 116 grains, in which the concentrated muriatic acid amounts to 42 grains. Therefore,\n\n\"One hundred parts of this corneous ore contain\n\n| Silver | 67.75 |\n|--------|-------|\n| Muriatic acid | 21 |\n| Oxide of iron | 6 |\n| Alumina | 1.75 |\n| Sulphuric acid | 0.25 |\n\n96.75.\"\n\nRed silver ore.—The following is the analysis of this ore, also by Klaproth.\n\"Upon 500 grains of bright, crystalline, red silver-ore, most finely pulverized, I poured five times their quantity of a mixture of equal parts of nitric acid of 1:35 specific gravity and distilled water. The phial was kept for several hours in a low digesting heat, so that the agency of the acid could be but moderate. I then diluted the solution with water; caused it to boil; and, after the residuum had subsided to the bottom, I decanted the clear solution. Upon the remaining pulverulent ore, a quantity of nitric acid and water, equal to the preceding, was again affixed; and, in the same manner, proceeded with as at first. The ore appeared now to have been effectually decomposed; and for this reason the solutions, together with the residuum, were put on the filter, and the latter properly washed.\n\n\"The filtered nitric solution had no colour at all, having been very much diluted by the water by which the residuum had been edulcorated. I subjected it to evaporation to 1/4th part, and found the bottom of the evaporating glass vessel, after cooling, covered with copious, finely grained, refractory, and heavy crystals of a gray white. To ascertain their nature, I procured, by a separate process, a quantity of a solution of the same red silver-ore, sufficient for this enquiry, and found that they were sulphate of silver. Being assured of this, I dissolved that sulphate by a proportionate quantity of water, assisted by heat, added it again to the nitric solution, and combined this last with muriatic acid, as long as any muriate of silver would precipitate; which, when collected, edulcorated, and dried, was found to weigh 391½ grains.\n\n\"The fluid, from which the horn-silver had been thus separated, was then reduced to a filter bulk, by distillation from a retort. This concentrated fluid became turbid, and left another grain of muriated silver on the filter. At this time it contained no other foreign substance, except a considerable portion of sulphuric acid.\n\n\"What remained undissolved by the nitric acid, consisted of an ash-gray, pretty loose, or flocculent powder, of 202 grains in weight. When this had been gently digested for half an hour, with a mixture of five parts of muriatic acid, mixed with one part of the nitric, and then diluted with half its quantity of water, there remained, after filtering, careful edulcoration, and drying, 65 grains; which were the sulphureous contents of the ore. When this residue had been gently heated, the sulphur desaggregated, leaving 61 grains of muriated silver behind. This sulphur, therefore, consisted of 58½ grains.\n\n\"After the filtered solution had been evaporated in part, it was poured into a large quantity of water. By management, a white precipitate immediately ensued, which being separated by the filter, edulcorated, and dried, and lastly heated in a porcelain cup, gave 133 grains in weight. But I could not find the least trace of arsenic in it, though I had subjected it to all the trials deemed proper for discovering its presence. On the contrary, it was manifest, that this precipitate wholly consisted of oxide of antimony, quite of the same nature with that which is produced when muriatic solutions of antimony are precipitated by water. On exposing it to heat, a small portion of moisture still evaporated, attended with a muriatic smell, which was hardly perceptible. When again put on a test, and mingled with a third part of charcoal dust, the coaly powder was slowly consumed, by burning, without any arsénical smell, and left behind it the metallic oxide, possessed of a gray colour, and partly blended, partly covered with a quantity of fine, gray-white, thinning, acicular crystals, or the flowers of antimony, as they are called. But when it was fused in a covered crucible with tartar and powdered charcoal, it was completely revived into reguline antimony, which being blown off with the bellows, a bead of silver was left, weighing half a grain.\n\n\"The liquor also, from which the antimonial oxide was separated, contained free sulphuric acid. On this account I put it into a retort, together with the nitric acid, from which the silver had been precipitated in the flake of horn-silver, by means of muriatic acid, and continued the distillation until, at this temperature, nothing more would pass over; but, on raising the heat, thick white vapours had begun to rise. The fluid left behind in the retort was found, upon trial, to be concentrated sulphuric acid. Upon diluting this last with water, and subsequent affusion of muriated barytes, the sulphate of barytes from thence produced, amounted, after edulcoration and defecation, to 194 grains.\n\n\"Consequently, the constituent parts discovered by these researches, are, silver, antimony, sulphur, and sulphuric acid.\"\n\nVitreous silver ore.—This has been also analyzed by Klaproth, according to the following method:\n\n1. If ductile vitreous silver ore be fused upon a piece of charcoal, by the assistance of the blow-pipe, its sulphur is quickly volatilized, and a button of pure silver remains. But it is otherwise with the brittle ore: for the bead left after the evaporation of the sulphur is brittle, and cannot be purified by the addition of borax. However, if a little nitrate of potash be added to the red-hot bead, it will destroy the portion of baser metal which it contains, and then the borate of soda causes it to yield a pure button of silver.\n\n2. One hundred grains of ore, previously levigated, were gently boiled in a sufficient quantity of nitric acid, diluted with an equal quantity of water. This operation was repeatedly performed, till the black colour of the powdered ore disappeared, and the insoluble portion had become of a loose texture, and had acquired a gray-yellow colour. When filtered and dried, this residue weighed 26 grains.\n\n3. On adding a solution of common salt to the above filtered solution, which had assumed a pale-greenish colour, a copious precipitate of horn silver ensued, which, edulcorated and dried, gave 88½ grains. Four parts of this afforded three of silver, by fusion with soda.\n\n4. The remaining solution was next combined with sulphate of soda; but neither any turbidness, nor any indication of the presence of lead, appeared. Upon this, caustic ammonia was affixed to excess; and the gray precipitate, which then fell down, and which the volatile alkali could not again render soluble, weighed five grams. Urged by heat, it melted into a confection like pap, at the same time that a weak arsénical smell was perceived. After this precipitate had been once more dissolved in nitric acid, the addition of soda caused it to yield a whitish yellow, alkaline sulphuret a dirty brown, and Prussian alkali a deep blue precipitate, liable to the attraction of the loadstone, after ignition. Therefore, it consisted of iron, with a slight trace of arsenic.\n5. The proportion of copper, indicated by a blue colour, in consequence of the addition of ammonia, and which still remained in the solution, was but slight. For, after the solution had been saturated with sulphuric acid, polished iron immersed in it, was invested with so slight a coppery crust, that no copper to any amount could be collected.\n\n6. Those 26 grains, which continued insoluble in the nitric acid (2.), were digested in nitro-muriatic acid, till nothing appeared to remain but the mere sulphur. Its weight amounted to 13 grains; but, after deflagration, it left behind it about one grain of quartzose matter of the mine.\n\n7. From this it is obvious, that 13 grains, or one-half of the above 26 grains, were held in solution by the nitro-muriatic acid; and these were precipitated entirely in the form of a white powder, upon the diffusion of 20 parts of water. When ignited, this precipitate assumed a yellowish colour; but there was nothing, either of arsenic, or any other volatile substance, perceivable. By combination with soda, it became reduced to pure reguline antimony; which, as such, admitted of being blown off without leaving any residue, in its usual form of a thick white smoke, adhering to the contiguous bodies in the form of needle-shaped flowers (oxide) of antimony. Those 13 grains of oxidized antimony are equivalent to ten grains of that matter in the reguline state.*\n\nFor the analysis of some of the other ores of silver, we must refer our readers to the ingenious and elaborate Essays of the sagacious Klaproth, from which we have extracted what is given above on this subject.\n\nSect. II. Reduction of the Ores of Silver.\n\nAlthough the ores of silver contain a larger proportion of extraneous matters than the ores of some other metals, the value of that metal being greater than that of many others, admits of greater expense in the processes employed for their reduction. The ores of silver are reduced, either by fusion, or amalgamation.\n\nReduction of silver ores by fusion.—Native sulphuret of lead, or galena, commonly contains a portion of silver, and often in such quantity, as to make its separation from the lead a profitable undertaking. The proportion of silver contained in lead is very variable. The greatest produce of silver which we have heard of, was got from the lead ore of Craven in Yorkshire, which amounted to 230 ounces of silver in the ton of lead. The mines of Cardiganshire yielded formerly 80 ounces per ton; the Durham and Westmoreland mines afford lead, from which 17 ounces of silver are obtained upon an average per ton. The lead procured from the mines of Ilay, one of the Western islands of Scotland, yielded, we have been informed, 40 ounces per ton; and the average produce of lead at the refinery at Poullauen, in Brittany in France, is above 39 ounces of silver per ton. The following is the process carried on at the latter establishment, for separating the silver from the lead.\n\nAfter the lead has been extracted from the ore, the object of the refiner is to obtain the silver in a separate state, which is dispersed through the mass of lead. This is performed by the process of cupellation on a large scale, or refining, as it is usually termed. The floor of the reverberatory furnace, in which the process is conducted, is horizontal, and it is lined with wood ashes and sand mixed together, and well beaten, and formed into a shallow basin, which is the cupel. There is an aperture at one side of the cupel, which forms a right angle with the flue by which the flame from the fireplace passes into the cavity of the furnace. Through this aperture the lead, brought to the state of litharge, runs; and opposite to it there is another aperture by which a blast of air is admitted. The top of the furnace has a circular aperture directly above, and corresponds in extent with the cupel, which may be shut up with a frame work of iron filled with bricks. When the furnace is ready, the cupel is lined with hay, and then charged with about 17 quintals of lead, in bars or pigs, through the circular aperture, and the cover being put on, the fire is lighted up. In the course of six hours, the whole of the lead being melted, and brought to a red heat, a blast of air is directed upon the surface of the lead, and the ashes of the hay, and other impurities are removed with a wooden rake. The blast being continued for half an hour and more, the surface of the lead begins to be covered with a thick crust of oxide, which is scraped off, and is soon succeeded by another, but it is not till the surface has been cleared five or six times, that the true litharge appears. When this is the case, the temperature is raised to a cherry red, and by the action of the blast, with the occasional aid of the workman, the litharge flows out through the aperture mentioned above. The intense heat volatilizes a considerable portion of lead, and so fills the interior of the furnace with vapours, that a person of experience only can discover what is going on in the cupel. At the end of 38 or 40 hours from the time that the fire is lighted, the contents of the cupel are reduced to about five quintals, and the litharge which comes over at this time is kept separate, because it contains a small portion of silver. At last the litharge ceases to flow, and the surface of the melted metal appears covered only by a thin pellicle. It then becomes gradually convex at the edges; the pellicle breaks up, and the surface of the metal appears quite bright. The blast is now to be turned off, the fire damped, and an aperture in the furnace, previously flopped with clay, is opened to admit a tin plate tube, through which a stream of water is poured into the cupel, in order to cool the metal rapidly, that it may be prevented from spitting, which would be the case, if this precaution were not observed at the moment of congelation. But the silver thus obtained is still contaminated with a portion of lead, from which it is freed by a second cupellation, which is performed in a moveable cupel containing about 700 or 800 ounces, and is placed in a small reverberatory furnace, which being heated about three hours, is charged with silver of the first cupellation. After the fusion of the silver, a proper working heat is kept up for four or five hours, when the refining is usually completed. The loss of lead by volatilization during the refining process is estimated at about eight per cent. When the quantity of litharge produced is large, it is reconverted into lead, by being returned into the reverberatory furnace, and treated in the same manner as the ore. This forms lead of the best and loftest quality, because it is in a state of the greatest purity. And besides, the scoriae that remain after the reduction of the ore, and the litharge, along\nSilver along with the old cupels, and the metallic foot which is deposited in the chimney of the furnace, are treated in a common blast furnace, and a considerable portion of lead is thus obtained.\n\nA different practice is followed in the English refineries. A common reverberatory furnace, having the area perforated with a large oval hole to receive the cupel, is employed. The cupel is formed of six parts of well burnt bone ashes, and one of good fern ashes mixed together, and moistened to a proper consistence. A quantity of this mixture is fired to the depth of about two inches in an iron frame, which consists of a raised elliptical rim, with five broad bars riveted to its bottom, so as to occupy nearly one-half of its area. The ashes are rammed down very close with a wooden beater, and particularly within the bars of the frame, as it is laid on a flat floor. More ashes are then added, and beaten carefully in, till the frame is quite full. By means of a sharp-edged spade, five inches square, a cavity is formed in the test for containing the melted metal, and at one end of the frame a semi-elliptical hole is cut through the breast, which latter is to be left of sufficient solidity and thickness. The test is now to be turned on its side, and dressed from all superfluous ashes adhering to the bottom, taking care that none shall be left flush with the bottom of the frame or cross bars, otherwise the test might be bulged, by fixing it at the bottom of the furnace. The rim being plastered with clay or moistened ashes, the test is placed upon the supporting cross bars, and fixed firmly with wedges against the bottom of the furnace, the breast being next to the feeding hole. A moderate heat is now applied, and gradually increased till the test be red hot; and when it ceases to emit steam from the under side, it is sufficiently dry. This previous preparation being completed, the following is the method of operation as it is described by Mr Sadler.\n\nLead previously melted in an iron pot is ladled into the test until the hollow part be nearly filled, the operator closes the feeding aperture, and increases the heat of the furnace until the surface of the lead is well covered with litharge; he then removes the door from the feeding hole, and with an iron rod, which has one end bent down at right angles about three inches and made flat or chisel-shaped, scrapes the small gutter or channel until the litharge just flows into it, the blast from a pair of double bellows is then directed from the back part over the surface of the test, the litharge is urged forward, and flows from the gutter upon the floor of the refinery; the operation now goes forward, gradually adding lead as the escape of litharge makes it necessary, until the gutter is so worn down that the test does not contain more than an inch in depth of lead, the blast is then taken off, the gutter filled up with moistened ashes, and a fresh one made on the other side the breast; the test is again filled, though not so full as at first, and the operation carried on until this gutter also is worn down and the test contain from about 50 to 70 pounds of alloy. This quantity is run into an iron pot, and let by until a sufficient number of pieces have been collected to make it worth while to take off a plate of pure silver from them.\n\nThe quantity of alloy left in the working off each test must depend in a great measure upon the quantity of silver which by estimation it is supposed to contain. A sufficient quantity of lead should always be left in the alloy to make it fuse easily in the iron pot.\n\nWhen the test is removed from the furnace and broken up, the litharge will be found to have penetrated to an inconsiderable but an equal depth in the ashes; that part not impregnated with litharge may be pulverized, mixed with fresh ashes, and again used for another test.\n\nThe operation of taking off the silver pure differs in no respect from the foregoing, only more care is observed in the working, not to suffer the escape of any metallic particles with the litharge, as that would occasion considerable waste of silver. As the process advances, and the proportion of silver to lead increases, the litharge assumes a darker colour, a greater heat becomes necessary, and at last the brightening takes place; the interior of the furnace, which during the whole of the process had been very obscure and misty, clears up. When the operator observes the surface of the silver to be free from litharge, he removes the blast of the bellows, and suffers the furnace to cool gradually; as the silver cools many protuberances arise on the surface, and fluid silver is ejected from them with considerable force, which falling again on the plate, spots it very fantastically with small globules.\n\nThe latter portions of litharge bring over a considerable quantity of silver with them; this is generally reduced by itself and again refined.\n\nThe litharge as it falls upon the floor of the refinery is occasionally removed; it is in clots at first, but after a short time as it cools it falls for the most part like flaked lime, and appears in the brilliant scales it is met with in commerce: if it is intended as an article for sale, nothing more is necessary than to sift it from the clots which have not fallen and pack it in barrels.\n\nIf, on the contrary, it is intended to be manufactured into pure lead, it is placed in a reverberatory furnace, mixed with clean small-coal, and exposed to a heat just sufficient to fuse the litharge. The metal as it is reduced flows through an aperture into an iron pot, and is cast into pigs for sale. During the reducing, care is taken to keep the whole surface of the litharge in the furnace covered with small-coal.\n\nIn some smelt works, instead of a reverberatory furnace for reducing, a blast furnace is made use of, on account of the greater produce, but the lead so reduced is never so pure as that made in the wind furnace. The oxides of the metals, which require a greater heat to reduce than the lead, are in the blast furnace generally reduced with it.\n\nThe volatile oxides, as zinc, antimony, and arsenic, are mostly carried off by evaporation during refining; a considerable portion of the oxide of lead itself is carried off by evaporation, making the interior of the furnace so misty and obscure that a person unused to refining cannot see more than a few inches into it.\n\nA considerable portion of these oxides is driven by the blast of the bellows through the feeding aperture, and would be dissipated in the refining-house, to the great injury of the workmen's healths; to prevent their ill effects, the arch or dome over the feeding hole is erected to carry the fume into the stack of the furnace.\n\nWe shall now describe the method of treating the\nproper ores of silver, as it is conducted by Schreiber at Allemont in France. These ores are native silver, and the Sulphuret of silver mixed with arsenical cobalt, pyrites, iron ochre, clay, calcareous spar, and some other earthy minerals. The silver being dispersed in very minute grains through the gangue, cannot be separated from the stony parts by washing. After the ore is picked by the hand, it is pounded dry in the stamping mill, and is reduced to the confluence of coarse sand. Roasting, previous to fusion is not required; but the ore being refractory, it is found necessary to employ a flux composed of quicklime, scoria from a preceding fusion, and slag from the iron forges. To supply the proper quantity of lead, powdered galena, with the litharge and scoria furnished by the refinery, and with old cupels ground to powder, is added to the ore, in such proportions that the lead, which is obtained by the fusion, may contain two per cent. of silver, allowing 20 per cent. at least of the lead to be lost by evaporation, or combining with the scoria. After being properly mixed, the materials are subjected to the heat of a powerful blast furnace, with alternate charges of charcoal. The products of the fusion are lead combined with silver, a black, compact, sulphureous, semi-metallic substance which is called matt, and some scoriae. The scoriae thus obtained is neglected, excepting a certain proportion, which is reserved as a flux for the next parcel of ore. But the matt, which is tolerably rich in silver, is again melted with litharge, and the lead carries with it almost the whole of the silver; and although this second matt contain a portion of silver, it is not found worthwhile to subject it to a second fusion. After refining the lead procured by these operations, it is found to yield about two per cent. of silver. The process of cupellation is performed at a higher heat than usual, which it is supposed is necessary by the presence of a small portion of iron; but the consequence of employing this high temperature is to increase the waste of the metal by evaporation; for instead of seven or eight per cent., it amounts to no less than 20 per cent. And as every pound avoirdupois of the lead thus volatilized, contains from six to ten grains of silver, the loss in this process is very great. Perhaps it might be diminished by mixing a larger proportion of lead with the silver ore.\n\nBut other silver ores afford both lead and copper, and in this case a more complicated operation becomes requisite. In the first part of the process the poorest kinds of silver ore, or such as contain but a small proportion of copper and lead, and a great deal of stony matter, are to be mixed with the poorer pyritical ores, or such as contain little silver and copper, and a great deal of sulphur and iron. A portion of scoriae obtained from a former process, and containing the oxides of lead and copper, with some silver, is added to this mixture by way of flux. The materials thus prepared being exposed to heat in a blast furnace, react on each other, and enter into fusion. The stony matter is dissolved, and the melted mass separates into two distinct parts, of which the heaviest occupying the bottom of the furnace, forms about one-fourth of the whole mass. This is called matt, and contains all the silver, with the greater part of the copper, most of the lead, iron, and sulphur, and generally zinc and arsenic. The slag which swims on the surface, as being the lighter portion, consists of the greater part of the sulphur, oxide of iron, and earthy matters; the small proportion of lead and copper is not worth the trouble of extraction.\n\nTo drive off part of the sulphur and other volatile impurities, the crude matt obtained in the preceding operation is roasted, and being mixed with one and a half times its weight of a richer kind of silver ore, and twice its weight of lead scoriae, by way of flux, it is again fused, and thus a rich matt is procured, which may contain from nine to ten pounds of lead, from three to four pounds of copper, and from six to seven ounces of silver in the quintal, besides a quantity of scoriae which holds a little silver, and which may therefore be successfully employed as a flux in subsequent fusions. This rich matt being roasted, is mixed with half its weight of litharge and scoriae in equal proportions, and again subjected to fusion. The product of this fusion is a quantity of metallic lead, containing from six to eight ounces of silver in the quintal; a similar quantity of copper matt, which contains from 30 to 40 pounds of copper, and about four ounces of silver in the quintal; and lastly a quantity of scoriae, which contains from six to ten pounds of lead, and about 40 grains of silver in the quintal.\n\nThe copper matt of the above operation is next roasted, and fused with a quantity of lead and copper scoriae, and the product obtained is black copper, which contains from 60 to 80 pounds of copper, and from five to ten ounces of silver in the quintal. This black copper being melted with litharge and scoriae, the molten part of the silver combines with the lead, and after one or two fusions, the copper is entirely freed, not only from the lead and silver, but also from the sulphur, iron, and other impurities.\n\nLiquation.—The affinity between lead and silver is much stronger than the affinity between lead and copper. In consequence of this affinity, lead and silver are easily separated from copper, by being exposed to a moderate heat. This process is called liquation or eliquation. When the black unrefined copper, or copper matt, contains the proper proportion of silver for this operation, it is first fused with lead or litharge, or with a mixture of the two, and an alloy consisting of copper, lead, and silver, is thus obtained. This is cast into moulds, so that the metallic product shall be in the form of round masses or loaves, which being set in a furnace on an inclined plane of iron, with a small channel grooved out, are exposed to a moderate red heat. By this process the lead melts, or, as it were, sweats out of the loaf, and carrying the silver along with it, on account of its stronger affinity for this metal, runs down the groove, while the copper remains behind as a dark red spongy mass. The lead containing the silver being subjected to the process of cupellation, the latter is obtained separate. But, in adopting this process, the proportion of the three metals must be attended to. The lead should not be more than four times the weight of the copper, otherwise the alloy becomes fusible, that part of the copper will be melted and carried along with the lead and silver; or, if too great a degree of heat is applied, the whole loaf of liquation will be fused, and the process must again be repeated. The proportion of lead should at least be 2½ times the quantity of copper, otherwise a considerable proportion of it, and also part of the silver, will remain in the loaf after heating. But as this process is now more rarely followed,\nwe shall not enter into any farther detail of the particulars connected with it.\n\nReduction of silver ores by amalgamation.—This process, by which silver ores are reduced, and which is now pretty generally followed, in different parts of Europe, was first practised by the Spaniards in South America. The ores which are subjected to amalgamation, are such as contain only a small quantity of lead or copper; but it is of some importance that there should be a certain proportion of iron pyrites, and if this proportion be not naturally mixed with the ore, it is a good practice to supply the deficiency, by adding what is wanting to the dressed ore, so that the pyritical contents may, as nearly as possible, be in a certain proportion to the quantity of silver, which is to be ascertained by previously assaying a portion of the ore.\n\nThe ore being reduced to the consistence of coarse sand, is carefully mixed with common salt, in the proportion of eight or nine per cent. when the silver in the ore amounts to eight ounces per quintal; and when the latter amount is 32 ounces, or even a greater proportion, from 10 to 12 per cent. of salt is to be added. The next process is roasting the ore, in which about three quintals are spread on the floor of a reverberatory furnace, and subjected to a moderate red heat. During the roasting the ore is to be turned twice or thrice, that every part of it may be equally exposed to the heat. The first charge being withdrawn, an experienced workman knows by its appearance whether the proportion of salt be too little or too much, and, as may be required, more salt or ore is added to the unroasted parcel. When the whole of the ore is roasted, it is ground in a mill, passed through sieves, by which it is made as fine as meal, and is then prepared for the proper process of amalgamation. This is performed in the following manner. A number of small barrels, which are made to revolve rapidly on their axes by means of machinery, or fixed tubs, either open or covered, having in the centre of each an instrument resembling a chocolate mill, which may be turned rapidly by similar machinery. The tubs or barrels are filled about one-third with water, and afterwards a sufficient quantity of roasted ore and mercury, in nearly equal proportions, is introduced, so that the whole may be of the consistence of thin mud. The machinery is put in motion, and continued without interruption for 30 or 48 hours, according to the nature of the ore, when the amalgamation is completed. About a quarter of an hour after the agitation of the matter in the barrels has ceased, the greater part of it falls to the bottom, and is withdrawn by opening a hole made for the purpose. The earthy residue is carefully washed by small portions at a time, and thus a good deal of the amalgam which, from being very minutely divided, could not sink through and mix with the rest, is recovered. The earth, however, if originally rich in silver, still retains a small proportion. It is therefore dried, and being mixed with about 3 per cent. of salt, is again roasted; but at a higher temperature than at first, and the process of amalgamation being again repeated, the whole of the silver is extracted. The fluid amalgam is strained through a closely woven bag, and is thus separated into nearly pure mercury and a stiff amalgam; and the latter being subjected to distillation, the mercury is driven over, and the silver remains behind. The copper, which is combined with the silver, is separated by cupellation.\n\nThe process of amalgamation is thus explained. The greater part of the sulphur of the silver and pyrites is, by roasting, burnt off, and converted into sulphurous acid, which latter, as soon as it is formed, and assisted also by the affinity of the silver for muriatic acid, decomposes the common salt, forming a sulphate or sulphite of soda, while the muriatic acid combining with the silver, forms muriate of silver. In the amalgamation which follows, the mercury, being in great proportion, decomposes the muriate of silver, and is partly converted into calomel. Hence it appears, that the loss of mercury, which is sometimes very considerable in this process, arises, first, from the conversion of part of it into calomel; and, secondly, from the extremely minute division of another part, so that it is carried off in washing the earthy residue; but the proportion of the latter depends much on management.\n\nBy the following method silver may be separated from copper, according to Napierone, without the expensive and complicated process of liquration. The mixed metal is melted; a quantity of sulphur is sprinkled over its surface, while the whole is stirred about with a stick by an afflant, so that the sulphur may combine with the copper into a matt, which floats above the metal, and is to be removed with a pair of tongs, previously moistening its surface with water, to make it solid. Another portion of sulphur is next to be stirred in, and the second matt produced is to be removed in the same manner. This process being repeated a sufficient number of times, the greater part of the copper is converted into matt, holding a small proportion of silver, while the remaining copper, which retains the most of the silver, originally diffused through the whole mass, becomes rich enough to be sent immediately to the refinery. In treating the matt, it is first to be reduced to powder, mixed with common salt and quicklime, in the proportion of 12 per cent. of each, roasted for 10 hours, amalgamated as before; and after three successive roastings and amalgamations, the whole of the silver may be extracted.\n\nTable of the quantity of Silver introduced into Commerce, taken at an average between the years 1799 and 1802.\n\n| Old Continent | Kilogrammes |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Siberia       | 175,000    |\n| Hungary       | 20,000     |\n| Austrian States | 5,000     |\n| Hartz and Hesse | 5,000     |\n| Saxony        | 10,000     |\n| Norway        | 10,000     |\n| France        | 5,000      |\n\n| New Continent | Kilogrammes |\n|---------------|------------|\n| North America | 600,000    |\n| Spanish possessions in South America | 275,000 |\n\nTotal: 947,500 Kilogrammes, or about 2,091,162 lbs. avoirdupois.\nCHAP. V. Of the Ores of Copper.\n\nThe ores of copper are very various. This metal is found native, in the state of oxide, in the state of sulphuret, and in that of salt, combined with carbonic, muriatic, phosphoric, and arsenic acids.\n\nSECT. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Copper.\n\nThe analysis of the ores of copper, it is obvious, must vary, according to the nature of the substances with which they are combined; but as a great proportion of the ores of that metal are combined with sulphur or arsenic, when they are to be treated in the dry way, they are first roasted, for the purpose of expelling those substances. To effect this, the ore is mixed with about one half its bulk of charcoal powder, or fine saw-dust, and then subjected to a low red heat, on a flat tile or muffle, on which it should be thinly spread. The sulphur or the arsenic rises in fumes; and to accelerate the separation of these substances, the mixture should be frequently stirred, observing at the same time not to increase the heat to such a degree as to make the ore clot together, which is one of the objects in the use of the saw-dust or charcoal. When it appears that the fumes cease to rise, and the whole of the charcoal is burnt off, the part of the ore remaining is now in the state of oxide, but mixed with a quantity of sulphur or arsenic, which cannot be entirely separated by roasting, and with the earthy matters with which the ore was originally combined.\n\nThe next object is to reduce the oxides, thus obtained, to the metallic state; and in this process of reduction the oxide is exposed to a high temperature, in contact with some carbonaceous matter, and secluded from the air. It has been a common practice to add some alkaline matters by way of flux, to promote the fusion of the extraneous matters combined with the ore; but the experience and observation of more enlightened chemists have proved, that a portion of the metallic oxide is always dissolved by saline fluxes, so that by affluence in the dry way with saline fluxes, a less proportion of metal than the ore really contains, is obtained from it. The loss, according to Klaproth, between the treatment of a copper ore in the dry way, and the same ore, in the moist way, amounted to no less than 9 per cent. To obviate this inconvenience, a flux is employed by some, composed of fusible glaas, into which a large proportion of alkali and silica enters, without any metallic matter, or fluor spar, lime, and particularly borax. By the latter, a thinner fusion of the vitrifying mixture, than by an equal quantity of any other substance, is produced, so that a smaller proportion of borax than of the alkaline matters answers all the purposes of a flux; and thus the loss of the metallic oxide, by solution, is less.\n\nBut in reducing the pure oxides, or the carbonated oxides of copper, the method which is attended with scarcely any loss, is by subjecting them in contact with charcoal, in a covered crucible, to an intense heat. It is indeed in this way that the reduction of roasted copper ores is conducted on a large scale; but as these latter contain sulphur, arsenic, iron, and other impurities, the process must be many times repeated before the copper is brought to a malleable state.\n\nIn reducing the sulphurated ores of copper, a button of metal, of considerable purity, may be sometimes obtained by means of a single operation. The tedious process of roasting is avoided by adding to the ore two or three times its weight of nitre, and projecting it into a hot crucible. When thrown into the crucible, a deflagration takes place, in which the sulphur is burnt, and converted into sulphuric acid, which unites with the potash of the decomposed nitre. The metal being now freed from the sulphur, is in a state of complete oxidation by the nitric acid, and may be reduced by adding a flux of tartar and pitch, or other similar matters, and applying a strong heat for a sufficient length of time. But it seems to be more advisable to separate the metallic oxide after deflagration. This may be done by washing the mixture, after which the oxide is to be reduced by the proper flux.\n\nIn the analysis of copper ores in the moist way, the metal is obtained separate in three states; either in the metallic state, in the state of black oxide, or in that of green carbonate. If a polished piece of iron be introduced into an acid solution of copper, it is immediately covered with a coating of shining metallic copper, which is owing to a part of the iron being dissolved by the acid, and a corresponding portion of copper being separated from the solution. The whole of the copper may be precipitated in this way, and at last the solution contains only iron. The precipitate, which is in the form of ragged filaments, may be washed, dried, and weighed, so that the proportion of the metal in the ore examined may be ascertained. It may be added, that the precipitation is greatly promoted, by boiling for a short time, especially towards the end of the process, which produces the separation of the last portions of the copper; and it should be farther observed, that a perfect separation of copper from iron is obtained only when the solution is made in sulphuric or muriatic acid, and not in nitric acid. The method of separating copper from silver has been already mentioned. It may be separated from lead, by adding sulphate of soda to the solution, by which an insoluble sulphate of lead is obtained, and the copper remains behind. To separate copper from antimony, the oxides of copper and antimony are digested with nitric acid; the copper is dissolved, and the antimony is left. By immersing a piece of metallic tin in the solution, copper may be separated from tin; for by this means the copper only is precipitated. Arsenic is separated from copper by dissolving in nitrous acid, and adding acetate or nitrate of lead, which produces an insoluble arseniate of lead, and leaves the copper behind. In case there should be an excess of lead, the addition of sulphate of soda will throw it down in the form of insoluble sulphate. When nickel is combined with copper, it is usually conjoined with iron. Ammonia precipitates all the three metals; but, when added in excess, redissolves the nickel and copper. To obtain the latter separate, superfaturate with muriatic acid, and introduce a polished piece of iron, by which the copper is precipitated, and the nickel remains in the solution.\n\nTo ascertain the quantity of precipitated copper obtained from the examination of an ore, it is to be washed and dried, put into a small crucible, moistened with a drop or two of oil, and covered with borax. Thus prepared, it is subjected to strong heat for a few minutes,\nCopper, and a solid button of malleable copper is produced, which may be accurately weighed. But if the product of the analysis be in the state of green carbonate, which is obtained by adding carbonate of potash or soda to a solution of copper, the green precipitate, thus formed, is to be washed and dried at the temperature of boiling water. An hundred and eighty parts of this carbonate are equivalent to 100 of metallic copper. The quantity of copper obtained by analysis may be estimated also in the state of black oxide. If the green carbonate be boiled for a few moments in caustic potash, it shrinks and becomes a deep brownish black fine powder, which is a pure oxide of copper in its highest state of oxidation. One hundred parts of this oxide, after being well washed, and dried in a low red heat, for a minute or two, are constantly found to contain 80 parts of pure metallic copper.\n\nWe shall now give a few examples of the analyses of particular ores of copper.\n\nVitreous copper ore, or sulphuret of copper from Siberia.—The following is the mode of analysis of vitreous copper ore by Klaproth.\n\n\"1. Upon 200 grains of the ore, coarsely powdered, moderately strong nitric acid was affused, which attacked and dissolved them with frothing and extrication of red vapours. The solution was clear, and the sulphur alone in the ore was left behind, floating in the fluid, in gray, loose flocculi, without any other residue; which indicated that no antimony was present. The sulphur collected on the filter was heated in a small crucible to inflammation, and it burned with its peculiar odour, without any trace of arsenic; yet leaving a slight portion of oxidated iron and siliceous earth.\n\n\"2. The solution, which had a pure blue colour, was treated first with muriate, and then with sulphate of soda. But none of these, nor any other salt, rendered it turbid, or produced any other alteration; by which it appears, that this ore contains neither silver nor lead.\n\n\"3. To determine, with proper accuracy, the proportion of the constituent parts, I repeated the examination in the following manner. Two hundred grains of the powdered ore were combined and heated with muriatic acid, to the degree of boiling. But as this alone manifested no action on it, I added nitric acid gradually, by drops, which exerted a strong attack in each instance. When the solution of the ore had been accomplished, I separated the fluid from the sulphur floating on the surface; and digested this last once more with a fresh quantity of muriatic acid, dropping into it some nitric acid, after which I collected it upon the filter. This sulphur, washed and dehydrated, weighed 38½ grs. out of which, after its combustion, 1½ grain of siliceous earth remained; so that the true amount of sulphur was 37 grains.\n\n\"4. The solution exhibited a glass-green colour. I divided it into two parts. Into one half polished iron was immersed, upon which the copper precipitated of a dendritical form, and pure metallic brilliance. It weighed 78½ grains, when washed, and immediately dehydrated in a moderate temperature.\n\n\"5. In order to ascertain the proportion of iron contained in the ore, I combined the other half of the solution with caustic ammonia added to excess of fumigation. The precipitated iron remained behind, in the form of a fustle brown mud, which, collected on the filter, dehydrated and ignited, weighed three grains. But as the iron is contained in the mixture of the ore, not in this calcareous state, but in the reguline, which last is to the first in the proportion of 3 to 4, these three grains of oxidated iron give 2½ of metallic iron to be added in the computation.\n\n\"Therefore, an hundred parts of the Siberian vitreous copper ore consist of,\n\n| Copper | 78.50 |\n| Iron   | 2.25  |\n| Sulphur| 18.50 |\n| Silice | 0.75  |\n\n100.00 *.\"\n\nVariegated copper ore.—This ore was analysed by Klaproth, in the following manner.\n\n\"1. One hundred grains of the pulverized ore were subjected to gentle digestion with nitric acid, whose action upon it was but moderate. From the residue, the sulphur was driven out by combustion. This residue, when a second time digested with nitric acid, dissolved in it, leaving only a slight portion of a red oxide of iron. On examining the solution, first by common salt, and then by Glauber salt, it continued limpid and unchanged.\n\n\"2. Upon 200 grains of the powdered ore, muriatic acid was affused, the mixture heated, and then combined in small portions with nitric acid. The solution, which was thus performed, had a brown colour while concentrated; but as soon as it was diluted with water, it acquired a green. The remaining sulphur was gray, tenacious, and spongy, and weighed 72 grains when dry. By slow combustion it left 3½ grains, of which, after extraction by muriatic acid, five grains still remained behind. These lost one grain more of sulphur by burning, and the remaining four grains dissolved entirely in muriatic acid. Whence the quantity of sulphur amounted to 38 grains.\n\n\"3. The muriatic solution was divided into two equal parts; and the copper was precipitated from one of them by means of iron. It amounted to 69½ grains.\n\n\"4. The other half was supersaturated with caustic ammonia, and the oxide of iron which fell down was collected. This, when moistened with linseed oil, and exposed to a low red heat, weighed 10 grains; which are equal to 7½ grains of metallic or reguline iron.\n\n\"Thus, in 100 parts of this variegated copper ore from Norway were found,\n\n| Copper | 69.50 |\n| Sulphur| 19.    |\n| Iron   | 7.50   |\n| Oxygen | 4.     |\n\n100.00\n\n\"In supplying the deficiency in the sum of weights of the copper, iron, and sulphur, from the hundred, by putting oxygen in the account, I mean to characterize this last as a constant constituent part of variegated copper ore, producing in it those variegated colours: in the same manner, as in steel, in copper pyrites, and other...\"\nother metallic substances, the beginning of their oxidation is indicated by a similar diversity of colours.\n\n\"In the last mentioned substances, however, the changeable colours are only owing to external causes; for which reason, they present themselves only on the surface, when long exposed to air. On the contrary, the variegated copper ore is penetrated throughout its whole mass by the oxidizing principle. This corresponds with the deficiency of weight to make up the sum of the fixed constituent parts of the ore here analyzed; whereas no such loss is observable in the vitreous copper ore, treated and decomposed by the same method. It is on this account also, that the action of the nitric acid is less strong, and the disengagement of nitrous gas is less copious, in the variegated than in the vitreous copper ore.\"\n\nMalachite, or carbonate of copper.—Klaproth analyzed a Siberian ore of this species, according to the following process.\n\n1. One thousand grains of compact reniform malachite, from the Turjin mines, on the Ural, were reduced to powder, and heated to complete redness in a small glass retort, connected with the pneumatic apparatus. Much carbonic acid gas was disengaged in this process, to the amount of 252 cubic inches, without reckoning that part which was absorbed by the water of the apparatus. This gas was entirely absorbed by lime water, at the same time that a proportionate quantity of carbonated or crude calcareous earth was produced. In the intermediate small receiver a moisture collected, weighing 78 grains, which, upon trial, proved to be pure water.\n\n2. The pulverulent residue taken out of the retort appeared of a black colour, and weighed 716 grains. To serve for the following experiments, it was divided into four parts, at 179 grains each; and hence corresponding to 250 grains of the rough malachite.\n\n3. One hundred and seventy-nine grains of ignited malachite, combined with three times its quantity of black flux, were put into an assay crucible, without lining it, and covered with muriated soda. In this situation it was committed to the fire of the blast furnace, and when the coals had become red hot without the action of the bellows, it was kept melting for the space of 20 minutes. After cooling, it was observed that, in the broken retort, the whole mixture, under the covering of common salt, had run into an uniform, compact, and opaque mass, of the bright red colour of ordinary sealing wax, and that no metallic button had been formed.\n\n\"It follows from this, that there was not carburetted enough present to take up entirely the oxygen of the metallic oxide. Therefore the copper has, by means of this small remainder of oxygen still united with it, been brought into the state of red oxide of copper; and, as such, it has diffused itself uniformly through the alkaline salt.\n\n4. One hundred and seventy-nine grains of ignited malachite were mingled with three times their quantity of black flux, and one-tenth of powdered charcoal. When fused in this state, during 20 minutes, under a flatrum of common salt, in an assay crucible not lined in the inside, they afforded a button of reguline copper, which had run well together, and weighed 136½ grains.\n\n5. Another 179 grains of ignited malachite, mixed with thrice as many grains of black flux, and one-fifth part of their weight of colophony, and likewise fused for 20 minutes, under a cover of muriate of soda, in a crucible not secured by lining, yielded a well-melted button of reguline copper, weighing 138 grains.\n\n6. The remaining 179 grains of ignited malachite were, like the preceding, melted during the time of 20 minutes, under a cover of common salt. But the assay crucible had previously been lined with powdered charcoal, and the malachite mingled with an equal weight of calcined borax, with half its quantity of white glass, and one-fourth part of colophony, or boiled turpentine. By this process I obtained, indeed, a well-fused button of reguline copper; but with a considerable loss, as it weighed only 103½ grains.\n\nIn order to discover more accurately the constituent parts of malachite, I performed the following experiments.\n\n7. One hundred grains of malachite, reduced to powder by trituration, were dissolved in nitric acid; which was effected without leaving any residue. The solution had a bright-blue colour, and was saturated to excess with caustic ammonia; but the precipitate produced was entirely, and without turbidness, redissolved by the excess of the alkali. This showed that the malachite here examined was perfectly free from iron, and similar admixtures.\n\n8. I combined 100 grains of triturated malachite with a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid, previously diluted with five parts of water, and accurately weighed together with the vessel. After the malachite had been wholly dissolved, which was effected gradually, and with a moderately strong effervescence, the loss of weight, occasioned by the carbonic acid gas that was extricated, was found to consist of 18 grams.\n\n9. One hundred grains of the same powdered malachite were ignited, at a moderate heat, in a covered crucible. The black residue had lost 29½ grains in weight. If from these be subtracted 18 grams for the carbonic acid, the remaining 11½ grams of loss will consist of water.\n\n10. And lastly, 100 grams, which had been dissolved in diluted sulphuric acid, and precipitated by zinc, yielded 58 grams of pure copper.\n\nIn consequence of these experiments, the Siberian malachite consists, in the 100, of:\n\n| Copper | 58 |\n|--------|----|\n| Carbonic acid | 18 |\n| Oxygen | 12.50 |\n| Water | 11.50 |\n\n100.00*.\"\n\nMuriate of copper.—This ore, when exposed upon 550° charcoal to the action of the blow-pipe, gave to the flame a blue and green colour; the muriatic acid was soon driven off, and a metallic button of pure copper remained.\n\nThis ore of copper was examined and analyzed by Klaproth in the following manner. A portion of the ore being reduced to powder, and boiled with water, communicated no colour to the solution; and, with the addition of a solution of nitrate of silver, afforded a small quantity of a white precipitate which blackened in\nin the day light. This experiment shews, that the proportion of muriatic acid is too small to give a compound soluble in water.\n\n\"1. One hundred grains of the elutriated mineral dissolved readily and quietly in nitric acid affused in the cold. The solution possessed a pure blue colour, and depolished a little of a brown iron ochre, which, separated by filtering, weighed a grain and a half. It was then diluted with water, and treated with a nitric solution of silver. The precipitated muriate of silver, when educorated, dried, and melted at a moderate degree of heat, in a silver pan, weighed 64½ grains.\n\n\"One hundred parts of metallic silver yield by such combination 133 parts of muriated silver. But as this metal, to be rendered soluble in acids, takes up 12 per cent. of oxygen, these must be subtracted; so that of this increase of weight by 33 parts, there remain 20½ for the muriatic acid.\n\n\"These principles being laid down, the above 64½ grains of muriated silver will fix the proportion of the muriatic acid, contained in 100 parts of the ore, very nearly to 10 grains.\n\n\"2. That I might be sure of having completely separated the muriatic acid from the nitric solution of this copper ore, I added the nitrated silver in a small degree of excess; and this silver I afterwards threw down with muriatic acid, and filtered it off. Which done, the copper was precipitated in the metallic state, by means of a piece of polished iron immersed in the solution. It amounted to 57½ grains when collected and carefully dried.\n\n\"The copper, however, is contained in the ore as an oxide. In this state its weight is increased 25 per cent. by the oxygen; which, for those 57.50 grains of metallic copper, just now mentioned, gives, by calculation, 14.38 grains.\n\n\"Now, since what is yet deficient from the first weight of the ore employed is to be considered for the greatest part as its water of crystallization, and since those 14½ grains of ferruginous ochre do not belong to the composition of the ore, the constituent parts of the muriated ore of copper may be said to be in the 100 as follows:\n\n| Oxide of copper | 73 |\n| Muriatic acid   | 10.1 |\n| Water of crystallization | 16.9 |\n\n*Effays, ii. 158.*\n\nPhosphate of copper.—The following is the method of analysis adopted by Klaproth, in the examination of this ore.\n\n\"1. Because this ore is very much intermixed with its quartzose matrix, I pulverized a portion of it, previously freed as much as possible from the stony matter, and ascertained the weight of quartz still united with it, by solution in nitric acid. The quartz amounted to 16 parts in 100 of the purified ore.\n\n\"On this consideration, I weighed 116 grains of the powdered ore, and poured nitric acid upon it. The mixture became of itself moderately warm. When the solution, affluted by a little heat, was thoroughly brought about, and by means of filtration freed from the undissolved quartz matrix, it shewed by its pure sky-blue colour, that it contained no iron.\n\nVol. XV. Part II.\n\n\"2. After the small portion of the predominant acid had been saturated with potash, I added to the solution diffused acetate of lead, until no farther precipitation took place. The precipitate was at first drenched for a while with weak acetic acid, then elixivated with water, and at last perfectly dried in a low heat. It weighed 138 grains.\n\n\"That this precipitate was a combination of lead with phosphoric acid, of this I had myself assured by a previous experiment, made with another portion of the same foil. It exhibited the phenomenon, which is peculiar to phosphated lead; namely, that under the blow-pipe it runs into a pearl, which in the very moment of fixation, rapidly assumes a garnet-like form with shining surfaces.\n\n\"Upon another portion of that precipitate, half its weight of sulphuric acid, sufficiently weakened with water, was poured and digested with it. The clear fluid, which had been filtered off from the generated sulphate of lead, and contained free phosphoric acid, was first half saturated with soda, and upon this perfectly neutralized with ammonia. By crystallization, it yielded microcofmic salt, or phosphate of soda and ammonia.\n\n\"3. In order to discover the proportion of the phosphoric acid combined with those 138 grains of the precipitate mentioned before, I proceeded to the following experiment.\n\n\"I burned pure phosphorus under a large glass-bell, diffused the obtained dry phosphoric acid in water, paffed it through the filter, and reduced it by evaporation, in a sand heat, to a smaller volume. When towards the end of this process, flames of phosphorated hydrogen gas appeared, I added nitric acid by drops till no longer any red vapours were discharged.\n\n\"Of this perfectly oxygenated unctuous liquid phosphoric acid, I diluted 100 grains with water, and neutralized the liquor with finely powdered white marble; of which 324 grains were employed. The mixture was evaporated to dryness, and the dry mass kept in a moderate red heat for half an hour. This ignited phosphate of lime weighed 256½ grains. In the 324 grains of marble employed in this experiment, the portion of lime, or pure calcareous earth, amounts to 178.20 grains, which if subtracted from the above 256.50 grains, determine the quantity of the phosphoric acid ingredient in that calcareous phosphate to be 78.30 grains.\n\n\"From these data, taken together, it now was rendered evident, that in those 138 grains of phosphated lead, which have been produced by the combination of lead with the phosphoric acid, constituting a component principle of the portion of the ore examined,—the concrete phosphoric acid amounts to 30.95 grains.\n\n\"4. The remaining part of the solution, which yet contained the cuprous part of the ore, was first treated with fulphate of soda, to separate the small portion of lead it still held diffused from a flight excess of acetate of lead added in the process (2.) Which done, it was mixed with a little of uncombined sulphuric acid, and a piece of polished iron put into it to precipitate the copper, which I found to weigh 54.50 grains. But as this metal is contained in the ore in an oxidated state, which requires 25 per cent. of oxygen; there must 68.13 grains be reckoned for the oxide of copper.\n\nOne\nOne hundred grains of this phosphated ore of copper, therefore, consist of,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Oxide of copper,} & \\quad 68.13 \\\\\n\\text{Phosphoric acid,} & \\quad 30.95 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{* 99.08.}\n\\]\n\nArseniate of copper, or needle-shaped copper ore.—This ore was examined by Klaproth, according to the following process.\n\n1. Under the blow-pipe, upon charcoal, this ore detonates, emits a white arsenical smoke, and runs into small reddish-gray globules, which, when again fluxed with borax, yield a pure regulus of copper.\n\n2. A pure, massive specimen of this ore, weighing 50 grains, was kept, in a porcelain crucible during 15 minutes, in a moderate red heat. Its figure was not altered by the fire; but its dark olive colour was changed into a bright grass green, inclining to that of the skin. Its weight was diminished by 1½ grain.\n\n3. Nitric acid dissolves it quietly in the cold, and the solution possesses an undefiled blue colour. By the addition of nitrated silver, the mixture is not in the least rendered turbid. Acetate of barytes produces a precipitate which entirely disappears upon dilution with water. The affluence of dissolved acetate of lead, forms with this solution a white precipitate, which upon the charcoal emits arsenical vapours, and is reduced to metallic lead, when combined with an excess of ammonia, the precipitate falling down at first, is directly redissolved, no cloudiness left behind, and the deep-blue colour is restored to the liquor.\n\n4. Also by the acetic acid this ore is gradually dissolved. Upon the evaporation of the solvent, a dark-green fault of a dendritical form remains behind.\n\n5. One hundred grams of the acicular olive copper ore, which had previously been freed, by means of elutriation, from the admixed reddish iron ochre, soon dissolved in nitric acid, and without the application of heat. The solution, being accurately neutralized with carbonated potash, was combined with dissolved acetate of lead, until all precipitation ceased. The obtained precipitate, when edulcorated and dried in a raised temperature, weighed 133½ grains.\n\n6. To be more convinced that this precipitate was an arseniated lead, I drenched it with water, and digested it with half its weight of sulphuric acid. The liquor separated by filtration, contained uncombined arsenic acid. I neutralized it with soda, and treated one part of it with a solution of nitrated silver. This produced a copious precipitate of arseniated silver, which possessed the brick-red colour peculiar to it, emitted arsenical vapours upon the charcoal, and was readily reduced to pure silver. The remaining part of the solution, when mixed with liquid nitrate of iron, afforded the common whitish precipitate of arseniated iron.\n\nNow in order to ascertain, by means of a comparative experiment, the proportion of the acid of arsenic combined with the 133½ grains of the above precipitate (1.), I dissolved in water 100 grams of solid arsenic acid, and added to it a solution of acetated lead in small portions so long as any precipitate would appear. The arseniated lead then obtained weighed 297 grams after edulcoration and drying in a warm place. Hence it followed, that the quantity of concrete acid of arsenic, combined with these 133½ grains of the precipitate, which the acid of arsenic contained in the ore had produced, must be estimated at 45 grams.\n\nAnd to be more assured that all the arsenical acid had been separated from the nitric solution of the ore, I added a little more of acetated lead than would have been absolutely requisite. This was afterwards again precipitated as sulphate of lead by adding sulphated soda, and filtered off. To the solution, thus freed from the last precipitate, I added uncombined sulphuric acid, and precipitated the copper, now disengaged from its mineralizing acid, by means of a polished piece of iron, in the metallic state. Thus I obtained of it 40½ grains.\n\nBut since in the composition of the olive copper ore the copper is contained in the state of an oxide, it yet remained to discover the proportion of oxygen. To attain this end, I dissolved 200 grams of pure copper in nitric acid, diluted the solution with a sufficient quantity of water, and again precipitated the metal with a lixivium of caustic potash. The precipitate had a light-blue colour; but after the mixture had stood a couple of days in a moderately warm place, that blue colour was changed into a brown. When separated by filtration, washed with a large quantity of water, and dehydrated in a low heat, this precipitate amounted to 260 grams. Upon ignition it weighed only 210 grams, and appeared in the form of a very flinty, fully-black powder.\n\nTherefore, because according to this experiment, copper acquires an increase of 25 per cent. of weight by combining with oxygen, it is obvious, that for the above 40½ grams of metallic copper, we must put in the account 50.62 grams of oxidated copper.\n\nIn consequence of this decomposition, 100 parts of the olive copper ore contain,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Oxide of copper,} & \\quad 50.62 \\\\\n\\text{Acid of arsenic,} & \\quad 45. \\\\\n\\text{Water of crystallization,} & \\quad 3.50 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{* 99.12.}\n\\]\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Copper.\n\nThe processes employed for the reduction of copper ores in the large way are extremely simple. It scarcely ever happens, it has been remarked, that the same order in conducting the different reducing processes, even in cases where the quality of the ore is found to be the same, is observed at two works. The same remark, however, might probably be made with regard to other manufactories, where the same practical management being long established, and attended with ordinary success, its inconveniences or advantages are rarely investigated, with regard to the abridgement of labour, or the diminution of expense. We shall now describe the processes for the reduction of copper ores, which are followed in different places, by which our readers, who are interested in the subject, will be enabled to appreciate the advantages of each, or to suggest improvements of which they are susceptible; and with this view, we shall describe the operations for reducing copper ores which are followed in Cornwall, and in Anglesea.\n\nMethod.\nMethod of reducing copper ores in Cornwall.—The ore is first broken to pieces, of the size of a hazel nut. This operation is known by the name of colking. The richer pieces of ore are then picked out by the hand. The next operation is roasting, which is performed in large reverberatory furnaces, 16 feet long, and 14 feet broad. The bottom of the furnace is composed of fire bricks, covered with sand, two feet thick. This sand becomes a lemmivitrified mass by the intense heat. The height of the chimney is from 40 to 50 feet, the draught of which is so strong, that the sulphur and arsenic, separated during the roasting, are carried almost entirely through it. The ore is introduced through a kind of funnel, and spread to the thickness of a foot over the bottom of the furnace. The fuel is placed at the anterior part of the furnace, so that the flame must pass over the surface of the ore as it is directed by the current of air towards the chimney. The ore is roasted in this furnace with a dull red heat for 12 hours, and is frequently stirred with an iron rake, to expose fresh surfaces to the flame.\n\nThe ore being sufficiently roasted, is carried to another furnace, nine feet long by six wide, where it is exposed to a fuming heat, without addition, except that of a little calcareous sand, when the flag does not rise freely. It is raked out at the end of every four hours, when it is of the consistence of soft dough, and is introduced into oblong moulds, a little water being sprinkled upon it, to make it sink down. The flag being raked off, a fresh quantity of calcined ore is introduced into the furnace, and the copper is tapped off by a hole in its side, which had been stopped up with wet clay mixed with one-fourth part of new coal, which prevents the clay from becoming so hard as to render it difficult to open the hole by means of an iron pick. As the rough copper flows from the furnace, it is conducted by a gutter into a large bucket, fulpeduled by chains in a well, through which a stream of water is passing. The metal, as it falls into the water, is granulated, without explosion or danger, and is afterwards taken out by raising the bucket.\n\nBut in this state the copper is very impure, being quite brittle, and mixed with arsenic and sulphur, which can only be separated by other processes. For this purpose it is again melted, and granulated two or three times. Each time a flag is thrown up in the furnace; but as it contains some copper, it is not, like the first flag, rejected, but worked over and over again with new charges of calcined ore. The nature of the ore must determine the number of fusions and granulations. After the granulation, the mass is melted and cast into pigs, which have a blistered appearance on the surface. These are again broken up, and melted and roasted several times, by which the metal becomes purer, and is then cast into iron moulds, after which it is carried to the refining furnace; and being again melted with the addition of some charcoal, it is brought to such a degree of purity as to bear the hammer, and be fit for the market. In this way, by repeated calcination and fusion, the common ores of copper are freed from arsenic, sulphur, and earthy matters, and brought to the metallic state. Here it is proper to add, that where there is variety of ores, no small degree of judgement is requisite in sorting and distributing them for the furnace, that the more fusible ores being mixed with such as are more refractory, will render the poorer ores, by the addition of a portion of the richer, worth the working.\n\nMethod of reducing copper ores in Anglesea.—The ore, which is the sulphuret of copper, is broken into small pieces, and exposed to heat in a kiln, which is closely covered. A little fire is applied to the mass of ore in different places, by which the whole is gradually kindled. The kiln is furnished with flues, which open into a long, close, pent-house gallery, for the purpose of collecting the sulphur, which rises in the state of vapour to the top of the kiln, passes through the flues into the long gallery, where it is slowly condensed, is afterwards taken out, and farther prepared for sale. The mass of ore, after it is once kindled, burns of itself for about six months, and in this time the sulphur chamber is four times cleared out. The improved sulphur chambers are constructed in the form of lime kilns, having the ore at the bottom, and the sulphur subliming at the top. The richer part of the roasted ore is exported without being subjected to any other preparation, but the poorer part is melted on the spot, and contains, besides a great deal of sulphur, many other impurities. The melting houses consist of a range of large reverberatory furnaces, having chimneys above 40 feet high, thus producing a very strong current of air. Thirty-one of these furnaces are arranged side by side under the same roof. The fuel, which is coal, is burnt on a grate at the anterior part of the furnace, and the flame is carried over the ore placed on the bottom of it, by the draught of air. Twelve hundred weight of roasted ore is introduced into the furnace, mixed with a small portion of coal dust. Here the ore is melted, and brought to an impure regulus, and when it is sufficiently fused, it is drawn off into earthen moulds. Each charge of the furnace is worked off in about five hours, and yields about half a hundred weight of rough copper, which after being further purified, affords about 50 per cent. of pure metal.\n\nIn reducing copper ores at Neufol in Hungary, lead is employed in the refining part of the process. The rough copper is spread out on the rough bed of a furnace, and after being five hours in fusion, a quantity of lead, in the proportion of from five to eight per cent. of the copper, is thrown in. This immediately begins to vitrify, and form a thick scoria, along with the impurities of the copper. The scoriae are successively removed, till the whole is separated, and the copper is purified. The scoriae retain a portion of the copper, and are employed in a future operation. The process continues from ten to twelve hours, with fifty quintals of raw copper.\n\nSome of the finer copper ores contain such a proportion of silver, as to render it worth while to extract the metal. In the different roastings and fusions which are employed to bring the copper to a state of purity, the silver always remains combined with it, so that it must be separated by another process. The method of separating silver from copper has been already described, in treating of the reduction of the ores of silver.\n\nThe springs which are found in copper mines, or flow from rocks which afford copper ores, are often so strongly impregnated with blue vitriol or native sulphate of copper, as to yield a considerable quantity of this metal. It is obtained by the following process. Large, square open pits, are formed of rammed clay, two or three\nthree feet deep. Into these pits the vitriol water is pumped; a quantity of refuse iron is thrown in, which being allowed to remain for a considerable time, the iron is dissolved by its stronger affinity for the acid, and the copper being separated, is precipitated in the form of brown mud. After the water appears to be exhausted of the copper, the oxide of copper collected at the bottom is raked out, and being dried in the sun, may be reduced in the usual way. This material, which is the richest employed in obtaining metallic copper, yielding fifty per cent, although contaminated with some iron and clay, is rarely melted, excepting along with the poorer ores, some of which do not afford more than five per cent. of pure metal.\n\nThe plates of copper of a fine red colour, usually known by the name of rosette copper, are made by a particular management. When the metal is found to be in a state of sufficient purity, the surface while in fusion is well scummed, and allowed to cool till it is just ready to fix. At this time the workman brushes it over with a wet broom, by which the surface is immediately fixed, and a thin plate is separated from the metal below, which is still in a fluid state. The plate thus produced is taken off and thrown into water, where it becomes of a high red colour. The same operation is repeated and continued successively till the whole of the fluid metal is converted into thin irregular plates of the above description.\n\n**Chap. VI. Of the Ores of Iron.**\n\nThe ores of iron, which present a considerable variety, are reduced, on account of the refractory nature of this metal, with no small difficulty. The most powerful agents must be employed for this purpose. And as the construction of furnaces is a matter of the greatest importance in the melting of iron ores, we will lead, when treating of that subject, to enter into a pretty full account of the processes themselves; to this account the reader is referred for information on the methods followed in the reduction of these ores. The present chapter therefore will be only occupied in giving an abridged view of their analysis.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Analysis of Iron Ores.**\n\n**Native Iron.**—In analysing this ore, it may be dissolved in diluted nitric acid; the lead may be separated by adding sulphate of soda, thus forming an insoluble sulphate of lead; the oxides of iron and copper may be precipitated by means of caustic fixed alkali at a boiling heat; the addition of caustic ammonia will dissolve the copper, and the iron will remain behind.\n\n**Pyrites.**—Iron pyrites is either magnetic, or is deficient in this property. When the ore is magnetic, it may be either proper magnetic pyrites, or common pyrites with a mixture of magnetic iron, either in the metallic state, or in that of black oxide. If the magnetism be owing to black oxide mixed with common pyrites, no hydrogen gas will be produced by digesting it in muriatic acid; and if metallic iron and pyrites be combined together, the gas obtained will be hydrogen gas; but if the ore examined be magnetic pyrites, the gas evolved by muriatic acid will be sulphurated hydrogen. The following analysis is applicable to both species of pyrites. 1. After reducing the pyrites to a very fine powder, let it be digested in nitric acid of moderate strength, and boiled almost to dryness; then add a fresh portion of acid, and repeat this process till the whole sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid. 2. Pour off the liquor, edulcorate the undissolved residue, and add the washings to the liquor. 3. Add to this carbonate of soda to a slight excess, and separate the precipitate, if any take place. 4. After neutralising the residual liquor by a little nitrous acid, it may be decomposed by muriate of barytes, which is to be added while any precipitate takes place. A hundred parts of this precipitate indicate 14.5 of sulphur in the ore. 5. The insoluble residue (2.) is next to be digested with caustic soda, and being evaporated to dryness and slightly ignited, the precipitate (3.) is to be added, and the whole dissolved in muriatic acid, and boiled nearly to dryness. By the affusion of water the silica will be left in the state of a white insoluble powder. 6. Mix the muriatic solution with ammonia in slight excess, and the alumina and oxide of iron will be precipitated together, leaving the lime, if there should be any, in the solution, from which it may be obtained in the state of carbonate, by a mild alkali. 7. The iron and alumina may be separated by boiling in nitric acid, which leaves the metallic oxide untouched, or by digestion in caustic potash or soda, which produces a similar effect.\n\n**Magnetic Iron Ore, Specular Iron Ore, and Red Iron Ore,**—are composed chiefly of oxide of iron, with an accidental quantity of silica and alumina. These ores are with difficulty acted on by acids alone. In conducting the analysis, therefore, 1. The ore is to be reduced to a fine powder, and heated in a silver crucible, with caustic soda in solution. When the whole moisture is evaporated, the remaining matter is to be ignited to a low degree for a few minutes; next dissolve the whole contents of the crucible in diluted muriatic acid; evaporate the solution nearly to dryness, and boil the residue in distilled water, acidulated with a little muriatic acid, and the silica will remain behind undissolved. 2. The solution being considerably reduced by evaporation, add caustic soda to a slight excess, and boil it upon the precipitate which is thus obtained. This precipitate, after being edulcorated, is pure oxide of iron, and being heated with a little wax, it may be brought to the state of magnetic oxide, one hundred parts of which indicate seventy-three of metallic iron. In this way the quantity of iron in the ore may be estimated. 3. The alkaline solution contains the alumina, which may be separated by muriate of ammonia, and after being washed and ignited, its quantity may be ascertained.\n\n**Black Iron Ore, and Brown Iron Ore.**—Besides the ingredients contained in the former species, these ores are combined with a portion of manganese; the precipitate obtained, therefore, is a mixture of the oxides of iron and manganese. These oxides may be separated by dissolving them in muriatic acid, and adding to the hot solution caustic soda, drop by drop, till the liquor becomes colourless, or till the precipitate thrown down at each addition of the alkali begins to be white. In this way the oxide of iron is precipitated, while that of the manganese remains in solution. The iron being removed, the oxide of manganese may be obtained, by continuing the addition of soda till no farther precipitate is produced. The two oxides may also be separated by adding succinate...\nsuccinate of soda to the muriatic solution, by which means the iron is precipitated, and the manganese remains in solution.\n\nSparry Iron Ore.—This ore of iron, which is supposed to contain carbonic acid, the oxides of iron and manganese, lime, magnesia and barytes, in the state of carbonate, with a small portion of silica and alumina, may be examined according to the following analysis:\n\n1. Digest the ore reduced to very fine powder, in muriatic acid, with a little nitric acid; a slight effervescence takes place, and the loss of weight indicates the quantity of carbonic acid driven off. 2. The insoluble portion of the ore, after being twice or thrice digested in muriatic acid, is silica. 3. The muriatic solutions and washings, being mixed together, are to be concentrated by evaporation, and decomposed at a boiling heat, by adding caustic soda in excess. 4. Boil the precipitate and supernatant fluid together for a short time, the alumina only will be dissolved. 5. The insoluble portion is next to be well washed and ignited, and being once abstracted with nitric acid, the lime, barytes, and magnesia, will be dissolved, leaving behind the oxides of iron and manganese. 6. To separate the oxides, digest the mixture with a gentle heat in diluted nitric acid, with the addition of a small bit of sugar; the manganese is dissolved, and the remaining oxide of iron may be brought to the magnetic state, by heating it with wax. 7. The nitrate of manganese may be precipitated by carbonate of soda, and after washing and drying it at a heat below redness, pure carbonate of manganese is obtained, one hundred parts of which indicate fifty-five of metallic manganese. 8. To the nitric solution (5.), a good deal diluted with water, add sulphuric acid as long as any precipitate is formed. The sulphate of barytes thus obtained being removed, the other earths may be thrown down by means of the carbonate of an alkali; they are again dissolved in diluted sulphuric acid, and the sulphates of lime and magnesia thus produced, being precipitated by alcohol, may be separated from each other by cold water. In this way the sulphate of magnesia is dissolved, with only a very inconsiderable quantity of the sulphate of lime.\n\nArgillaceous iron ore, bog iron ore, blue earthy and green earthy iron ores,—are chiefly composed of the oxides of iron and manganese, phosphate of iron, silica, alumina, and lime. The analysis of these ores may be conducted according to the following process:\n\n1. After the ore is reduced to powder, and ignited, abstract it two or three times with nitric acid; pour off the acid, and wash the residue with a small portion of strong nitric acid. 2. Add the acids together, evaporate nearly to dryness, wash the residue with cold water; the phosphate of iron remains behind. 3. Ignite the insoluble residue (1.) with caustic soda, and separate the silica as in a former analysis, by muriatic acid. 4. Mix the nitric and muriatic liquors, boil them with an excess of caustic soda, and the alumina will be dissolved, while the metallic oxides and lime are precipitated. 5. After ignition, abstract the compound precipitate with nitric acid; the lime is now dissolved, and nothing remains but the oxides of iron and manganese, which may be separated according to the preceding analysis.\n\nArseniate of Iron.—This ore is found to contain oxides of iron and copper, with arsenic acid, besides a portion of silica, and sometimes lime. It was analysed by Mr. Chenevix, according to the following process. Being reduced to powder, and subjected to less than a red heat, the water of crystallization is driven off; the residue is next boiled with caustic potash, and the alkaline solution being separated by filtration, is to be neutralized with nitric acid. The addition of nitrate of lead affords a precipitate of arseniate of lead, one hundred parts of which indicate thirty-three of arsenic acid. Muriatic acid is next to be added to the residue, which is insoluble in potash; the iron and copper are thus dissolved, and the silica remains behind. By supersaturating the muriatic solution with ammonia, the oxide of iron will be precipitated, and the oxide of copper will remain in solution by the alkali.\n\nBut, for practical purposes, we shall give a short view of the simpler methods of assaying the ores of iron, which are chiefly employed in manufacture, with the view of ascertaining the quantity of metal to be obtained from them, when treated in the large way. Among the older metallurgists it was usual to employ active saline fluxes in assaying the ores of iron; but as the metallic part of the ore can only be brought into fusion at a very high temperature, the same degree of heat effects the vitrification of the earthy matters, when aided by lime and bottle glass, so that the use of borax, or alkaline salts, which are more expensive, may be dispensed with.\n\nTo assay the richer varieties of magnetic iron ore, particularly iron sand, reduce them to a fine powder, add one twelfth of charcoal, or double the quantity of fine saw dust, and expose the mixture in a covered crucible for an hour to the heat of a powerful wind furnace. After this the iron will be found at the bottom of the crucible, in the form of an irregular button, and covered with a small portion of cellular scoriae. This process will be sufficient where the quantity of earthy matter is small; but as the common magnetic iron ore contains a considerable proportion of silica, a flux of the following materials may be necessary. For every eight parts of ore take eight parts of bottle glass, six of limestone or chalk, and one of charcoal; mix the whole carefully together with the ore, and expose the mixture to heat as in the former case. If the operation have succeeded, a button of iron will be found at the bottom of the crucible, covered by a compact, vitreous, greenish flag.\n\nAs the specular iron ore generally contains a portion of sulphur, from the admixture of pyrites, it must be roasted at a moderate red heat, till the sulphurous odour is no longer perceptible; then to eight parts of the ore, add eight of bottle glass, six of chalk, and one twelfth of charcoal, and treat the mixture as before. The red, brown, and black iron ores, may be assayed in the same way.\n\nSparry iron ore may be assayed without roasting, by reducing it to powder, and placing it in a crucible lined with a mixture of charcoal and clay, and then covering it with about one fourth of its weight of calcined borax.\n\nIn assaying argillaceous and bog ores of iron, they are first to be roasted, and then mixed with eight parts of bottle glass, seven of chalk, and one and a half of charcoal, to eight parts of ore, and subjected to fusion in an unlined crucible. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the proportion of chalk may be diminished in treating...\ning those varieties of ore which contain calcareous earth in considerable quantity.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Iron.\n\nIn treating of the construction of furnaces, the proper form and management of which are of the utmost importance in extracting the metal from the ores of iron, we were led to enter pretty fully into the nature and effects of the smelting process, or the method of reducing iron ores. We shall not, therefore, resume the subject in this place. See Furnace.\n\nChap. VII. Of Lead.\n\nIn the present chapter we shall first give an account of the most improved methods of analyzing the ores of lead; and secondly, treat of the best methods of reducing or smelting these ores.\n\nSect. I. Of the Analysis of Lead Ores.\n\nThe analysis of the ores of lead is less difficult than that of the other metals of which we have just now treated; and when accuracy is wanted, the humid way of analysis is to be preferred. The method of separating lead from silver has been already noticed, as well as that by which it is separated from iron and copper. The same process as that employed for separating iron and copper from lead, may be followed with regard to the separation of lead from tin, cobalt, and zinc. We shall now give an account of the analysis of particular lead ores.\n\nGalena, or sulphuret of lead.—This species, which is the most common ore of lead, was analyzed by Vaquelin, by the following process:\n\n1. Three hundred parts of the ore reduced to powder, were roasted, and loft during the process, twelve per cent.\n2. Three hundred parts of the same ore were heated with nitric acid very much diluted; a strong odour of sulphurated hydrogen was perceived, and the solution of the lead being completed and filtered, there remained on the filter pure silica, which being heated to redness and cooled, weighed fifty grams, or 16.67 parts per cent.\n3. The solution of lead in nitric acid being decomposed by means of sulphate of soda, and the sulphate of lead precipitated being washed and dried, weighed 250 grams, or 63.1 of metallic lead per cent.\n4. After the sulphate of lead was separated, ammonia was added, and a precipitate of oxide of iron was obtained, which being subjected to a red heat, weighed ten grams, or was equal to 3.33 per cent.\n5. Carbonate of potash being added to the residual liquor, threw down nine grams of carbonate of lime, which is equal to three per cent. The sulphuret of lead thus analyzed, afforded in one hundred parts,\n\n| Substance       | Weight |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Sulphur         | 12     |\n| Silica          | 16.67  |\n| Metallic lead   | 63.1   |\n| Oxide of iron   | 3.33   |\n| Carbonate of lime| 3     |\n| Loss            | 1.9    |\n\nTo assay galena in the dry way, it is to be mixed after roasting with three times its weight of black flux, covered with salt, and melted. A button of lead will be found at the bottom of the crucible, but the silver and other metals which existed in the ore, are still combined with the metallic lead.\n\nSulphuret of lead, antimony and copper.—An ore of this kind was analyzed by Mr Hatchett, by the following process. Two hundred grains of the ore were heated in a matras, with two ounces of muriatic acid, and nitric acid was very slowly added, till the whole exhibited a moderate effervescence. Being gently heated for an hour, the solution assumed a green colour, and a quantity of sulphur which floated on the surface, being collected, digested separately with a little muriatic acid, and washed and dried, weighed thirty-four grams; and as it burnt entirely away without any residuum, in a red earthen cup, it was perfectly pure. The solution with the muriatic acid, in which the sulphur had been washed, was first boiled, and afterwards mixed with six pints of boiling distilled water, to which it communicated a milky appearance. It was filtered while hot, and the filter washed with another portion of boiling water. The white precipitate, which was oxide of antimony, was dried in a sand bath, and weighed sixty-three grams. When the liquor with the washings cooled, some crystals of muriate of lead were deposited. The liquor was afterwards evaporated nearly to dryness, and a few drops of sulphuric acid were added, to separate the lead which remained in solution. The residue being again dissolved in boiling water, was entirely decomposed by sulphate of soda, and the sulphate of lead thus obtained being added to the former portion, was washed and dried on a sand bath. It weighed 120 grams.\n\nThe liquor, which was now bluish green, assumed a deep blue colour by the addition of ammonia; a small portion of the oxide of iron was separated, which, when dried and heated with wax, became magnetic, and amounted to 2.4 grams. The liquor, after being evaporated nearly to dryness, was boiled with a strong solution of potash, till it was nearly dry, and the residue being washed with water, a black oxide of copper remained; which, after being dried, weighed thirty-two grams.\n\nWhite lead ore, or carbonate of lead.—The white tabular lead ore, from Leadhills in Scotland, was analyzed by Klaproth, according to the following process.\n\n1. One hundred grams of it, in pure specimens, and previously triturated to a powder, were by small portions introduced into a mixture of 200 of nitric acid with 300 grams of water, and put in equilibrium upon the balance. The ore dissolved readily, and with a strong effervescence, without leaving any residue. By the carbonic acid that escaped, there was a loss of 16 grams of weight.\n\n2. The solution, which was clear and colourless, was diluted with water, and a cylinder of zinc put into it. After 24 hours, the whole of the lead had shot into beautiful metallic laminae, which collected, washed, and both quickly and carefully dried, to the end that no oxidation might take place, afforded 77 grams of lead in the reguline state, which correspond with 82 grams of oxidated lead.\n\nConsequently, the constituent parts of this tabular\nLead and carbonated white lead ore, bear to each other the following proportion:\n\n| Oxide of lead | 82 |\n|--------------|----|\n| Carbonic acid | 16 |\n| Water        | 2  |\n\n*Effus., ii. 132.*\n\nGreen lead ore, or phosphate of lead.—The following is an example of the method of analysing this species of ore, adopted by Klaproth.\n\n\"1. An hundred grains of this ore, in very pure specimen, left on solution in dilute nitric acid one half grain of the quartzose matrix behind; which I separated and replaced by an equal quantity of pure ore. The colourless solution, treated with nitrate of silver, yielded 10 grains of muriated silver; which indicates 1.54 of concrete muriatic acid, contained in 100 of the ore.\n\n\"2. In the next instance, the ingredient lead was separated by means of sulphuric acid. The collected phosphate of lead, after gentle ignition, weighed 104½ grains; for which 77.10 grains of oxidized lead must be put in the account.\n\n\"3. When after this the nitric solution had been freed, by nitrated barytes, from the portion of sulphuric acid added to excess, and subsequently treated with ammonia so far, that the acid still predominated, I continued adding a solution of acetated lead, till no more turbidness was effected. The generated phosphate of lead, when collected and exposed to a gentle red-heat, proved to weigh 85 grains; and consequently, the proportion of the phosphoric acid must have been 19 grains.\n\n\"4. The remaining fluid was mixed with muriatic acid, the mixture evaporated to dryness, and extracted with ardent spirit. The residue, after completely evaporating the spirit, was again dissolved in water, and treated with Prussian alkali. A precipitation of prussiate of iron ensued, which indicated the amount of oxide of iron 10 grains.\n\n\"From the results of this decomposition it follows, that the constituent parts of green lead ore, and their proportion to each other, are:\n\n| Oxide of lead | 77.10 |\n|--------------|------|\n| Phosphoric acid | 19   |\n| Muriatic acid | 1.54 |\n| Oxide of iron | 0.10 |\n\n+ 97.74.\"\n\nRed lead ore, or chromate of lead.—In analysing this ore, Vauquelin adopted the following simple process. Equal weights of the ore reduced to fine powder, strong muriatic acid, and distilled water, were digested together at a moderate temperature, and stirred from time to time. The chromate of lead is thus decomposed, and converted, for the most part, to muriate of lead, which is of a white colour. When the acid has ceased to act, pour off the liquor, add fresh muriatic acid, diluted as before with an equal weight of water, and to the amount of about one fourth of the former quantity, and digest till the whole of the orange coloured particles among the white muriate disappear. This liquor is to be added to the former, along with the washings; the whole is to be heated, and placed in a cool place for a few days, that the small portion of muriate of lead which it holds in solution, may be deposited; and this being removed, add very gradually oxide of silver, precipitated from its solution in nitric acid by caustic potash, till the last portions assume a red purple colour. In this way the whole of the muriatic acid is separated, and the liquors contain only chromic acid, which is deposited by slow evaporation in the form of small, prismatic, ruby red crystals. The quantity of muriate of lead, obtained by this process being ascertained, will shew the quantity of metallic lead contained in the ore.\n\nYellow lead ore, or molybdate of lead.—Klaproth analysed this ore in the following manner.\n\n\"1. A hundred grams of the crystals were carefully freed from the adhering calcareous earth and ochre of iron, and then finely pulverized. They were then dissolved in muriatic acid, assisted by heat, alternately affusing upon them the acid, and a large quantity of water. In this instance a trace of siliceous earth, though scarcely discernible, appeared.\n\n\"2. The greatest part of muriate of lead, generated in the process, was deposited in fine needles, even before the solution had completely grown cold. The supernatant clear fluid was then poured off, reduced to a smaller volume by evaporation, and freed from the muriated lead, which still separated. The muriated metal, collected with care, and briskly defecated, weighed 74½ grams. By dissolving it in hot water, and steeping into the solution a polished piece of iron, the lead precipitated upon this last in fine lamellae, and in the metallic state.\n\n\"3. But in order to find more accurately what proportion this muriated lead might bear to pure oxide of lead, I made the following experiment.\n\n\"Two hundred grams of lead, cut into shreds, were dissolved in 300 grams of nitric acid, diluted with 10 ounces of water, and, with the assistance of digestion, in a boiling heat. The solution was then divided into two parts.\n\n\"a. Into one half I dropped muriatic acid, as long as it produced any turbidness; evaporating afterwards the mixture to the most perfect dryness of the residue. The muriate of lead here produced weighed 133 grams.\n\n\"b. From the second half of the nitric solution I precipitated the oxide of lead by dissolved caustic potash. This oxide, when edulcorated and briskly dried till it began to turn yellowish, amounted to 115 grams.\n\n\"From this it followed that those 74½ grams of muriated lead, obtained from 100 grams of the yellow molybdate of lead (2.), are equal to 64.42 grams of pure oxide of lead.\n\n\"4. The concentrated muriatic solution of molybdena, which had a blue colour, was mixed with nitric acid, and lodged in a sand-bath for farther evaporation. Being thus circumstanced, it was again deprived of its blue colour, and a yellow oxide of molybdena separated. But when the evaporation had been carried on to complete dryness, I collected and weighed the remaining lemon-yellow oxide of molybdena; and found it amount to 34½ grams.\n\n\"Therefore, one hundred parts of the purest crystals of the yellow lead ore, from Carinthia, contain,\nLead.\n\nOxide of lead 64.42\nOxide of molybdena 34.25\n\n* 98.67.*\n\nSulphate of lead.—This ore of lead was analysed by Klaproth according to the following process.\n\n\"1. One hundred grains of tabular sulphate of lead from Wanlockhead, in select pure specimens, lost 2½ grains, by being heated in a covered crucible. When finely pulverized and ignited in a platina crucible with 400 grains of carbonate of potash, they yielded a brownish-yellow, moderately concrete mass. Upon this substance, previously triturated, water was affixed and heat applied to promote the solution of the soluble parts. As in the case of the preceding fossil, so in this an oxide of lead deposited from the liquor, which, when washed, dried and moderately ignited, weighed 70½ grains. Diluted nitric acid took the whole of it up without the assistance of heat, and afforded a clear solution, from which the lead has been precipitated in the reguline state, by means of zinc. The metallic lead, thus obtained, when collected, washed and quickly dried, amounted to 64½ grains.\n\n\"2. In order to ascertain the quantity of sulphuric acid contained in the alkaline solution, it was combined with nitric acid added to super-saturation in some degree, and, in the next instance, treated with acetate of barytes. By this management sulphate of barytes was formed and precipitated, to the amount of 76 grains, after being heated to redness: which indicates 25½ grains of concrete sulphuric acid.\n\nAccording to this decomposition, an hundred parts of this tabular sulphate of lead consist of,\n\n| Oxide of lead | 70.50 |\n| Sulphuric acid | 25.75 |\n| Water of crystallization | 2.25 |\n\n† 98.50\"\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Lead.\n\nGalena is by far the most abundant ore of lead, and indeed almost the only ore which is subjected to the process of reduction. The treatment of this ore of lead in this way is very simple. The first object in dressing the ore, is to separate the extraneous matters or impurities, such as iron pyrites, blende, calcareous spar, quartz, &c. The purer part of the ore is broken into pieces about the size of a hazel nut, and washed from any earthy matters which adhere to it, and then it is ready to be melted. A ton, or a greater quantity of the ore, is spread on the floor of a common reverberatory furnace, with a low arch, and with the flame of pit coal it is quickly brought to a red heat; being, during this time, occasionally fitted with iron rakes, to expose fresh surfaces to the action of the heat. When it begins to assume the consistency of paste, the heat is lowered, and kept at a dull red, till the whole of the sulphur is nearly driven off; when the heat is increased, and the ore brought to perfect fusion. The mass consists of two fluids, the upper being a vitreous flag, and the lower metallic lead. The fire is now damped, and a few handfuls of quicklime thrown in, by which the scoriae become suddenly solid, and are removed to the side of the furnace. The tap hole is now opened, and the lead runs into moulds, in which oblong masses or pigs, about 60 pounds each, are formed. After the lead has run out of the furnace, the hole is again closed, the scoriae are replaced in the bed; and the heat being raised to a glowing red, they are soon melted. The greater part of the lead separates from the flag, and collects in a mass at the bottom. The scoriae become solid with the addition of a little lime, and the lead is let off into the mould. The second scoriae still contain a portion of lead, from six to eight per cent.; but as it is not worth the expense of extracting, it is thrown away. It is found that the first running of lead is the best; the second, which is obtained from the scoriae, being considerably harder, on account of a greater proportion of iron combined with it.\n\nThe process which is followed, at least in most parts of Scotland, is somewhat different from that now described, particularly in the previous preparation of the ore. The masses of ore, as it is brought from the mine, being separated from any adhering impurities, are reduced to small pieces, well washed, and then pulverised. In this state it is ready for the melting process, which till of late was usually performed in an open furnace.\n\nIn some mining countries there is a considerable proportion of white lead ore mixed with the galena; doubts have been entertained whether it be profitable to retain this ore, even although it contain a large proportion of metal, because in the reverberatory furnace it is vitrified immediately on the application of the heat, and acting as a powerful flux, the whole is brought into fusion before the sulphur be entirely separated; so that the proportion of scoriae in this case is greatly augmented, with very little increase in the produce of lead.\n\nChap. VIII. Of the Ores of Tin.\n\nThere is no great variety of the ores of tin. It is usually found in the state of oxide, or in that of sulphuret, when it is also combined with copper, and a small proportion of iron.\n\nSect. I. Analysis of the Ores of Tin.\n\nBefore treating of the analysis of the ore of tin, we shall first describe a very simple process for assaying it. The ore is first reduced to the consistence of coarse sand, and separated from the flinty matters by washing. If it appear, by subjecting a grain or two to the action of the blow-pipe, that it contains arsenic, 200 grains of the ore mixed with a little charcoal, are to be roasted in a calcining tefl at a low red heat, till the whole of the arsenic is driven off. The residue is withdrawn, mixed with a little pitch and fine saw-dust, introduced into a crucible lined with charcoal, and after a cover is fitted on, placed in a large furnace, whose heat is to be raised to a bright red. In about 20 minutes the reduction is completed, the crucible is removed, and a button of metallic tin is found at the bottom, covered with a little scoriae. But if the ore should contain no arsenic, the previous process of roasting is unnecessary.\n\nTinstone.—The best method of analysing the ores of tin, is that contrived by Klaproth, by means of the fixed alkalies, which was conducted according to the following process.\n\n\"1.\n\"1. One hundred grains of tin-stone from Alternon, in Cornwall, previously ground to a subtile powder, were mixed in a silver vessel with a lixivium containing 600 grains of caustic potash. This mixture was evaporated to dryness in a fand heat, and then moderately ignited for half an hour. When the gray-white mass thus obtained, had been softened while yet warm, with boiling water, it left on the filter 11 grains of an undissolved residue.\n\n\"2. These 11 grains, again ignited with six times their weight of caustic potash, and dissolved in boiling water, left now only 1½ grain of a fine yellowish-gray powder behind.\n\n\"3. The alkaline solution (1. and 2.), which was in some degree colourless, was saturated with muriatic acid. A brilliant white, tender oxide of tin was thrown down, giving to the mixture a milky appearance. This precipitate, re-dissolved by an additional quantity of muriatic acid, was precipitated afresh by means of carbonated soda. When lixiviated and dried in a gentle heat, it acquired the form of bright yellowish transparent lumps, having in their fracture a vitreous lustre.\n\n\"4. This precipitate, being finely powdered, soon and entirely dissolved in muriatic acid, assisted by a gentle heat. Into the colourless solution, previously diluted with from two to three parts of water, I put a stick of zinc; and the oxide of tin, thus reduced, gathered around it in delicate dendritic laminae of a metallic lustre. These, when collected, washed, and fused, under a cover of tallow, in a capsule placed upon charcoal, yielded a button of pure metallic tin, weighing 77 grains.\n\n\"5. The above mentioned residue of 1½ grain, left by the treatment with caustic potash (2.), afforded with muriatic acid a yellowish solution; from which, by means of a little piece of zinc introduced into it, one half grain of tin was still deposited. Prussian alkali, added to the remainder of the solution, produced a small portion of a light-blue precipitate; of which, after subtracting the oxide of tin now combined with it, hardly one fourth of a grain remained, to be put to the account of the iron contained in the tin-stone, here examined.\n\n\"In these experiments, (excepting only a slight indication of filex, amounting to about three fourths of a grain), no trace has appeared, either of tungstic oxide, which some mineralogists have supposed to be one of the constituent parts of tin-stone, or of any other fixed substance. Therefore, what is deficient in the fum, to make up the original weight of the fossil analysed, must be ascribed to the loss of oxygen; and thus the constituent parts of pure tin-stone from Alternon are to each other in the following proportion:\n\n| Tin     | 77.50 |\n|---------|-------|\n| Iron    | 0.25  |\n| Silex   | 0.75  |\n| Oxygen  | 21.50 |\n\n100.00 *.\"\n\nThe analysis of grained tin ore, or wood tin, may be conducted in the same way as the former.\n\nTin pyrites.—The following is the process which Klaproth adopted in the analysis of this species of tin ore.\n\n\"1. Two drams of finely triturated tin pyrites were treated with an aqua regia, composed of one ounce of muriatic and a half ounce of nitric acid. Within 24 hours the greatest part of the metallic portion was dissolved in it, without application of heat; while the sulphur rose up, and floated on the surface of the menstruum. After the mixture had been digested upon it for some time in a low fand-heat, I diluted it with water, and filtered it. It left 43 grains of sulphur on the paper, still, however, mixed with metallic particles. When the sulphur had been gently burnt off on a tile, there still remained 13 grains; of which eight were dissolved by nitro-muriatic acid. The remaining part was then ignited with a little wax; upon which the magnet attracted one grain of it.—What remained was part of the filaceous matrix, and weighed three grains.\n\n\"2. The solution of the metallic portion (1.) was combined with carbonate of potash; and the dirty green precipitate, thus obtained, was re-dissolved in muriatic acid, diluted with three parts of water. Into this fluid a cylinder of pure metallic tin, weighing 217 grains, was immersed. The result was, that the portion of copper contained in the solution, deposited itself on the cylinder of tin; at the same time that the fluid began to lose its green colour, from the bottom upwards; until, after the complete precipitation of the copper in the reguline state, it became quite colourless.\n\n\"3. The copper thus obtained weighed 44 grains. By brisk digestion in nitric acid, it dissolved, forming a blue tincture, and left one grain of tin behind, in the character of a white oxide. Thus the portion of pure copper consisted of 43 grains.\n\n\"4. The cylinder of tin, employed to precipitate the copper, now weighed 128 grains; so that 89 grains of it had entered into the muriatic solution. From this, by means of a cylinder of zinc, I re-produced the whole of its dissolved tin, which was loosely deposited on the zinc in a tender dendritical form. Upon being assayed, that all the tin had been precipitated, I collected it carefully, lixiviated it cleanly, and suffered it to dry. It weighed 130 grains. I made it to melt into grains, having it previously mixed with tallow, and under a cover of charcoal dust, in a small crucible; which done, I separated the powder of the coal by elutriation. Among the washed grains of tin, I observed some black particles of iron, which were attracted by the magnet, and weighed one grain. Deducting this, there remain 129 grains for the weight of the tin. By subtracting again from these last, those 89 grains, which proceeded from the cylinder of tin employed for the precipitation of the copper (2.) there remained 40 grains for the portion of tin contained in the tin pyrites examined. Hence, including that one grain of tin, which had been separated from the solution of the copper (3.), the portion of pure tin contained in this ore amounts to 41 grains. An hundred parts yielded,\n\n| Sulphur | 25 |\n| Tin     | 34 |\n| Copper  | 36 |\n| Iron    | 2  |\n| Earthy matters | 13 |\n\n100 *\"\n\n* Effius, i. 523.\n\nVol. XV. Part II.\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Tin.\n\nTin stone, or vein tin, as it is called in Cornwall, contains a large proportion of stony matters. It is first broken by hammers into pieces of the size of a hen's egg, when it is ready for the operation of flanging, which is performed in the way already described for the ores of gold, excepting that there are only three tampers. A tin plate about a foot square, and pierced with holes to admit a moderate sized knitting-needle, is inserted in front of the trough, and that surface of the plate with the rough extremities of the holes is on the inside, by which the holes are prevented from being plugged up with the ore. As the ore is reduced to the proper fineness, it passes with the water through the holes into the labyrinth, where it is collected, and after being washed on a wooden table, when it is ready for roasting. In this state it has a considerable proportion of copper and iron pyrites, and is called black tin. After being calcined at a low red heat for several hours, in a large reverberatory furnace, the ore comes out of a bright ochre red colour, owing to the decomposition and oxidation of some of the metallic substances; but the oxide of tin, when the operation is properly conducted, remains unaltered. The ore is washed a second time, to separate the remaining impurities; and the water which is impregnated with sulphate of copper, is retained and decomposed by means of old iron.\n\nThe reduction of the ore is the next step in the process. Seven cwt. of roasted ore, with one fifth of its bulk of small coal, are introduced into a reverberatory furnace, which is about seven feet long, and 3½ wide. No lime, or indeed flux of any kind is required. A brisk heat is kept up for about six hours; the tin sinking down as it is reduced, and covered with black scoriae. The furnace is now tapped, and the metal flows into a shallow pit. When the whole of the metal has run out, the scoriae are removed from the furnace, and a fresh charge is made. The metal in the pit throws up a flag, rich in metal, which is immediately returned into the furnace; and after the melted tin has cooled a little, it is taken out with iron ladles, and poured into granite moulds. Each charge affords on an average from four to five cwt. of metal; but as the first scoriae are not entirely free from metal, they are again flanged and washed, and mixed with a new parcel of roasted ore. The pigs of tin are next put into a small reverberatory furnace; where, without any addition, they are subjected to a very gentle heat; the purest part of the tin melts first, and is drawn off, forming what is called common grained tin; the other part contains some copper, arsenic and iron, which is brought to a state of fusion, and cast into pigs, forming common tin.\n\nStream tin ore, which is peculiar to Cornwall, is prepared for the furnace by reducing it to powder, and passing it through wire sieves, which have 16 meshes in the square inch. A blast furnace is employed, which is about seven feet high, and is supplied with air from two cylinders washed by an overshot water wheel. The method of managing the furnace, after being fully heated, is the following: Three or four shovels full of ore, and two or three half bushels of charcoal, without any kind of flux, form a charge with which the furnace is fed at short intervals. There is a small channel at the bottom of the furnace, through which the reduced tin constantly flows into a pit below, and the slag which accompanies it is removed from time to time, and returned into the furnace. When the pit is full, the melted metal is removed into an iron boiler three feet in diameter, having a small fire under it, to keep the metal in fusion. Two or three large pieces of charcoal are then placed upon the tin, and forced to the bottom by means of an iron instrument resembling a wheel, with a long handle fixed in the axle. This produces a violent ebullition, and a little flag, before mixed with the metal, rises to the surface, and is removed. In a minute or two the metal is tried, as it is called, by taking up a ladleful, and returning it again into the mass; when, if it assume a bright silver-like appearance, and a uniform consistence, the purification is complete. When cool to the proper degree, it is removed into the moulds, where it is formed into pigs of two or three cwt. Stream tin ore yields from 65 to 75 per cent. of the best and purest tin.\n\nChap. IX. Of the Ores of Bismuth.\n\nBismuth is found in the metallic state, accompanied by native silver, blende, and galena, some other metals, and earthy substances. It is also met with in the state of oxide, and also in the state of sulphuret.\n\nSect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Bismuth.\n\nIn conducting the analysis of the ores of bismuth, previous roasting is not requisite. The native bismuth, or oxide of bismuth, dissolves readily in nitrous acid, diluted with about one third of water, and either in the cold, or with a moderate heat; but boiling is necessary for the sulphuret, to precipitate the sulphur, and dissolve the bismuth. The greater part of the nitrate of bismuth may be precipitated from the solution, and separated from the metals with which it is usually alloyed, by adding a large quantity of water. But to separate the bismuth totally, evaporate the clear liquor which remains over the precipitated oxide to a small bulk, so as to retain in solution the nitrates of the other metals. Add muriatic acid by drops, as long as any white cloud is formed. This last precipitate consists of the remaining portion of the oxide of bismuth, mixed with muriate of silver, if the ore examined contain any of that metal. Then add a few drops of strong nitric acid, which dissolves the bismuth, and leaves the silver; and to this portion of the nitrate of bismuth add water, which separates the whole by precipitation. To ascertain whether the solution contains any silver, expose the precipitate by muriatic acid to the light, which will become of a bluish or slatey colour, if any silver has been dissolved; but if not, the pure white colour remains unaltered. As the oxide of bismuth is composed of 81.3 per cent. of metal, and 18.7 of oxygen, the proportion of metal in the ore may be precisely ascertained by weighing it. The other metals held in solution by the nitrous acid, which are chiefly lead, iron, copper and cobalt, may be separated in the usual way.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Bismuth.\n\nThe low degree of heat at which bismuth is fusible, renders\nrenders the reduction of the ores of this metal a very simple process. In the treatment of the native metal, and the oxide, the weight of the ore of black flux is put into a crucible along with it, covered with falt, to about a finger's breadth, and melted for 5 minutes with a brisk fire; when it is cold, the bismuth is found in a clean button. The flux employed by others is one part of borax, and the same quantity of powdered glaas, to two of the ore, and the fusion is effected in a crucible lined with charcoal. With the oxide, a little oil, rosin, or charcoal, should also be mixed. Previous roasting is necessary in the treatment of the sulphuret of bismuth, to separate the sulphur; the other part of the treatment is the same with that now described.\n\nBut in the large way, the ores of bismuth are reduced merely by heating them along with burning fuel. Sometimes a shallow hole is made in the ground, and filled loosely with pieces of wood and buttes, and after the fire is kindled, the ore reduced to small pieces is thrown in; sometimes the fluff of a hollow pine tree is filled with wood and ore alternately, and set on fire; the bismuth separates from its matrix, and collects in a mass at the bottom.\n\n**Chap. X. Of the Ores of Zinc.**\n\nThe ores of zinc are, the native carbonate, or common calamine, the oxide of zinc, and the sulphuret.\n\n**Sect. I. Analysis of the Ores of Zinc.**\n\nOn account of the great volatility of zinc, it cannot be examined in the dry way, or subjected to assay, without particular precaution. In assaying blende, or the sulphuret of zinc, the ore, after being bruised, is to be carefully separated from particles of galena, or other impurities. It is then to be roasted, and the sulphur being driven off, to be reduced to fine powder, mixed with half its weight of charcoal, introduced into an earthen retort, to which a tube is fitted. The retort being exposed to a strong heat in a wind furnace, for three quarters of an hour, is to be gradually cooled, and on breaking it, the zinc is found in the neck, in metallic drops. The object may be accomplished in another way. Prepare the ore as before, and having mixed it with charcoal, let it be stratified in a crucible; with its own weight of copper clippings; and having luted on a perforated cover, subject it for nearly an hour to a low white heat. Allow it to cool, and examine and wash the contents. The globules of brats formed are thus easily separated from the other impurities, and the excess of weight of the brats above the copper, indicates the quantity of zinc given out by the ore.\n\n**Blende, or sulphuret of zinc.**—This ore is found to contain not only zinc and sulphur, but sometimes iron, lead, copper, and arsenic, with silica, alumina, and a portion of water. It may be analysed by the following process:\n\n1. Introduce into a small coated glass retort, 200 grains of ore reduced to powder, and let it be gently ignited for a quarter of an hour. The fluid collected in the receiver will be found to be water.\n\n2. Digest another portion of ore in repeated quantities of diluted nitric acid, till every thing soluble is taken up; wash the residue; weigh and ignite it; the loss of weight indicates the quantity of sulphur which is burnt off.\n\n3. Digest the residue in a little nitro-muriatic acid, till the insoluble portion becomes quite white, which is pure silica.\n\n4. Add to the nitric solution (2.) a few drops of sulphate of soda; evaporate gently, and continue to add sulphate of soda while a precipitate is formed, and after being evaporated nearly to dryness, digest in diluted muriatic acid; the sulphate of lead remains behind.\n\n5. Add together the nitro-muriatic solutions (3., 4.); decompose by carbonate of soda, and digest the precipitate in caustic ammonia; the zinc and copper are thus dissolved.\n\n6. Let the ammoniacal solution (5.) be saturated with muriatic acid; boil it, and add caustic soda, while a precipitate takes place: this is the brown oxide of copper.\n\n7. Oxide of zinc now only remains in the soda solution, which is to be saturated with muriatic acid, and decomposed by carbonate of soda. The precipitate obtained after ignition is oxide of zinc.\n\n8. The residue which was insoluble in ammonia (5.), is to be treated repeatedly with nitric acid, and digested in caustic soda. Oxide of iron, contaminated slightly with arsenic, remains insoluble.\n\n9. Having saturated the soda solution (8.) with nitric acid, add nitrate of lead, till no farther precipitate is formed; the precipitate is arseniate of lead.\n\n10. And to the residual liquor, add first, sulphate of soda, to separate any nitrate of lead that may remain; filter the liquor, decompose it by carbonate of ammonia; the precipitate, washed and ignited, is pure alumina.\n\n**Calamine, or carbonate of zinc.**—The ores of this species contain, besides the carbonate of zinc, the carbonates of lead, iron, and lime. The following is the mode of analysis.\n\n1. The ore reduced to powder is to be dissolved in diluted nitric acid; the loss of weight during the solution indicates the quantity of carbonic acid. Neutralize the solution with caustic soda, evaporate gently, and add from time to time, a few drops of sulphate of soda while any precipitate is formed.\n\n2. Having thus cautiously brought it nearly to dryness, digest it in highly rectified alcohol, and afterwards in a little cold water, which will take up everything but the sulphates of lead and lime.\n\n3. These may then be separated by digestion in sulphuric acid very much diluted, which will take up the sulphate of lime, leaving the sulphate of lead pure.\n\n4. Neutralize the muriatic solution by soda, and evaporate nearly to dryness; then add alcohol to the residue, which will throw down the sulphate of lime with a little sulphate of soda, which latter may then be washed away by a little cold water.\n\n5. The alcoholic solution (2.) after evaporation to dryness, may be digested in caustic ammonia, which will take up the oxide of zinc, and leave behind the oxide of iron.\n\n6. The alkaline solution, after being slightly supersaturated with muriatic acid, is to be decomposed by a perfectly carbonated alkali, by which the zinc is procured.\ncured in the state of carbonate; and this, after edulcoration, being dissolved by sulphuric acid, and the solution ignited in a platina crucible, affords dry sulphate of zinc, containing 50 per cent. of oxide of zinc.\n\n7. Thus, all the constituent parts are ascertained except the water: to determine the proportion of this, take a fresh parcel of the ore, weigh it, and then ignite it for half an hour, note the loss of weight, and transfer the residue into muriatic acid; if while it dissolves in this fluid it gives out any gas, let the loss of weight be noted; then add together the losses by ignition and solution; deduct from the sum the known weight of the carbonic acid, and the residue is water.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Zinc.\n\nThe ore being reduced to small pieces, and the different impurities being separated, it is next calcined in a reverberatory furnace at a moderate red heat, and if the ore be calamine, the carbonic acid is driven off, and if blende, it is deprived of its sulphur. After this it is washed, and the metallic oxide being separated from the earthy parts, it is dried, and carefully mixed with about one-eighth of its weight of charcoal, by grinding the ingredients together in a mill, and is now ready for the smelting process. This is performed in a circular furnace, in which are fixed five large earthen pots, about four feet high and nearly of the shape of oil jars. An iron tube is inserted into the bottom of each pot, and, passing through the arched floor of the furnace, terminates in a vessel of water placed beneath, while the other end of the tube rises within the crucible to a few inches of the top. The crucibles are then filled with the mixture of the ore and charcoal, to the level of the tube, the cover of each is carefully luted on, and an intense heat is to be kept up for several hours. The zinc, as the process of reduction goes on, rises in the form of vapour to the top of the pot, but as it cannot escape, it descends through the iron tube, passes into the water, and is condensed in small drops. The globules are afterwards fused, and cast into the form of ingots, when it is fit for the market.\n\nBut as common zinc contains a little of other metals, as copper, lead, arsenic, iron, and manganese, which impair its quality, these impurities are partially separated by melting the zinc in a crucible, and stirring into it, with a stick or earthen rod, a mixture of sulphur and fat; by the latter the zinc is preserved from oxidation, and the sulphur combines with all the other metals except the zinc, and converting them into sulphurets, they rise to the top in the form of scoriae, which may be removed. This process is to be repeated as long as any scoriae appear. The method of purifying zinc proposed by Proult, is simple distillation in an earthen retort. The zinc passes over, and the oxides of the other metals remain behind. But it is supposed that the arsenic or lead cannot be separated in this way.\n\nChap. XI. Of the Ores of Antimony.\n\nNative antimony is a very rare production; the most common ore of antimony is the sulphuret; but it is also sometimes found in the state of oxide.\n\nSect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Antimony.\n\nGray ore of antimony, or sulphuret of antimony.—As the sulphurets of antimony are the principal ores of this metal, we shall only describe the process by which the analysis of these ores may be conducted.\n\n1. Five hundred grains being reduced to fine powder, are to be digested with 1500 grains of pure nitric acid of specific gravity 1.25, and 1000 grains of water, for half an hour, at 150° Fahrenheit; then add a quantity of pure water, equal to the rest of the fluid; mix the whole well together, and pour off the liquor as soon as it becomes clear. This consists of the nitrates of silver, lead, and copper, and perhaps a little iron dissolved in an excess of acid. By simple boiling and filtration, the iron is separated in the state of red oxide.\n\n2. Add to the solution muriate of soda, while any precipitate takes place, and let the whole stand till the supernatant liquor becomes clear; the precipitate is pure muriate of silver.\n\n3. The solution (2.) is next to be saturated with potash or soda, and concentrated by evaporation to one-third of its bulk. The addition of caustic ammonia in excess throws down the lead in the state of oxide, and the copper remains in solution.\n\n4. Acidulate slightly the solution (3.) with nitrous acid; add carbonate of potash, by which the green oxide of copper will be precipitated, and being subjected to a low red heat, is reduced to the state of brown oxide, of which 100 parts indicate 85 of metal.\n\n5. The portion of ore (1.) which was insoluble, is next to be digested at a degree of heat below boiling, with successive portions of nitromuriatic acid, composed of nitric acid, as long as any thing is taken up. The different solutions are then mixed, concentrated by evaporation, and poured into a large portion of pure water; a precipitate immediately takes place, which is the white oxide of antimony, which, after being separated and washed, is to be mixed with twice its weight of crude tartar and a little nitre, and then exposed to a full red heat, which in a few minutes reduces it to the metallic state.\n\n6. The solution (4.) contains now a little sulphuric acid and iron, with some earthy matters. By adding nitrate of barytes while any precipitate is produced, the quantity of acid may be ascertained, and then adding caustic potash in excess, which assisted by a boiling heat, will precipitate the iron, and retain the alumina and silica.\n\n7. The insoluble residue (6.) contains sulphur and earth; it is decomposed by a red heat, the sulphur being dissipated, and the earth remains.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Antimony.\n\nThe ore of antimony, which is found in sufficient quantity to be employed in the process of reduction in the large way, is the sulphuret, the analysis of which has now been detailed. The ore being separated from the greater part of the stony matters which adhere to it, is placed on the bed of a reverberatory furnace, and covered with charcoal powder; and being brought to a low red heat, the sulphuret enters into fusion, and the earthy...\nAntimony earthy parts floating on the surface, are removed with a rake. The melted part is cast into the form of large cakes, and is the crude antimony of the shops.\n\nThe metal is obtained in a state of purity from the crude antimony, or sulphuret, by different processes. The following is recommended as one of the best, and most frequently practised. The sulphuret being reduced to small pieces, is strewed thinly on the floor of a reverberatory furnace, to drive off the sulphur. The heat at first must not exceed that of the melting point of tin, otherwise the antimony will melt. A lamplight blue flame is observed over the surface of the ore, which proceeds from the combustion of the sulphur; the metal is deprived of its lustre, and is converted into a grayish oxide. In the course of some hours, by carefully stirring the ore, and cautiously increasing the temperature, as the fusibility diminishes, it at last ceases to give out sulphurous vapours, and can bear a moderate red heat without melting. After the roasting, the ore is removed from the fire, and is found changed into an almost gray oxide, weighing from 30 to 36 per cent. less than the sulphuret, but it is not yet entirely free from sulphur. To reduce the oxide, mix it with half its weight of crude tartar, and subject to a full red heat in a covered crucible. The oxide is decomposed by the carbonaceous part of the tartar, and the antimony reduced to the metallic form, is collected at the bottom of the crucible. A small proportion, however, still remains, dissolved by the sulphuret of potash formed by the alkaline base of the tartar, and the sulphur of the oxide. The quantity of metal which is thus obtained in the large way, amounts to 66 or 70 per cent. of the oxide employed. The loss, however, would be greater, if the ore has not been properly roasted.\n\nThe reduction is effected also by another process, which is supposed to be more economical. The roasted oxide is mixed with oil or fat, and a little powdered charcoal, and then introduced into a crucible; and as the metal begins to appear, powdered nitre, in the proportion of an ounce to a pound of oxide, is gradually injected, after which the whole mass is brought to a perfect fusion, affording a pure metal, and in greater proportion than in the usual way.\n\nThe only other process which we shall mention, for reducing sulphuret of antimony, is that by means of some of the other metals, for which the sulphur has a greater affinity than for the antimony. Proceeding on this principle, iron, copper, lead, silver, and tin, may be employed in the process; but as iron is not only more effectual, but also cheaper, it is preferred. The antimony obtained by this process, was formerly called martial regulus, not only on account of the iron being used in the preparation, but, not improperly, on account of a small portion of that metal which still adheres to it. The proportions recommended are the following: Eight ounces of small iron nails are heated in a crucible almost to whiteness; 16 ounces of crude or roasted sulphuret of antimony, coarsely pounded, are then added; the crucible is covered, and the fire kept up; and in a few minutes, when the whole is melted, three ounces of nitre are to be added; after a slight detonation has taken place, the whole is brought to perfect fusion. It is then put into an iron cone previously heated and greased, and as the mass becomes solid, the sides of the cone are struck, to promote the precipitation of the metal. When cold and weighed, a mass of antimony is obtained, equal to about 10 ounces of the sulphuret employed, covered with alkaline ferruginous scoriae, from which it is easily separated by a blow of the hammer.\n\nBut the metal is not yet entirely free from iron and sulphur; to purify it still farther, therefore, it is to be remelted. Two ounces of crude antimony, and three of nitre being added, and when the detonation has ceased, it is poured into a cone, and the metal is separated as before, from the scoriae. Fuse the metal again; project upon it three ounces of nitre; separate the purified metal from the scoriae; remelt with a strong heat, projecting gradually three ounces of nitre, and immediately pour it into a cone. About eight ounces of a beautiful stellated regulus, covered with yellowish white scoriae, are thus obtained.\n\n**Chap. XII. Of the Ores of Cobalt.**\n\nCobalt exists usually in a state of combination with arsenic and sulphur, or in the state of oxide. Scarcely any of its ores are free from arsenic and iron. Nickel is also sometimes abundantly mixed with the ores of cobalt, and occasionally a little manganese and copper.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Cobalt.**\n\nWhite and gray cobalt ores, consisting chiefly of arsenic and cobalt, may be examined in the dry way, according to the following process, which, however, is not to be considered as very perfect. The ore is to be mixed with charcoal or saw-dust, and roasted to drive off the arsenic. The oxide after calcination is mixed with four times its weight of an equal mixture of carbonate of potash and tartar, and heated intensely, at the temperature which is required for melting cast-iron. A button of metallic cobalt is found beneath the scoriae, which are always of a deep blue, or nearly black colour, owing to the combination of part of the oxide of cobalt. A hundred grains of this ore, treated by Klaproth according to this process, yielded 44 grains of metallic cobalt; but if the ore contained iron, copper, or nickel, it must have been alloyed with these metals, and perhaps not entirely free from arsenic.\n\nBut the analysis may be conducted with more accuracy according to the following process by Taffaert. *Ann. de Chim. xxviii.*\n\n1. With a view to ascertain the quantity of arsenic, he digested 100 parts of cobalt ore with diluted nitric acid. The whole was dissolved in a few hours, and deposited on cooling, white crystalline grains. By evaporation more crystals were deposited; the whole collected and dried, weighed 56 parts, and excepting three parts, the whole was sublimed. These 53 parts are oxide of arsenic, and indicate 49 per cent. of metal in the ore.\n\n2. Three hundred parts of the ore digested with four times as much nitric acid, afforded a rose-coloured solution. After partial evaporation, and with the addition of water and heat, a pale-red precipitate (1.) was formed, leaving a rose-coloured solution. The solution being boiled with an excess of potash, afforded an oxide of cobalt, which was rose-coloured, and then green, and when dried in a red heat, black. The amount was 85 parts.\n3. These 85 parts, dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, gave, with the addition of pure ammonia, a black precipitate, which, excepting a small portion, was again dissolved by an excess of alkali. The undissolved portion treated again with nitro-muriatic acid and ammonia, was reduced to four parts, and appeared to be oxide of iron.\n\n4. The rose-coloured precipitate (2.), which was a mixture of arseniate of cobalt and iron, being decomposed by caustic potash in excess, afforded a precipitate, which weighed, after being dried, 100 parts.\n\n5. The 100 parts (4.) being again dissolved in nitric acid, and the solution being partially evaporated, and then diluted with water, gave a precipitate of 27 parts of oxide of iron, and left a clear solution of cobalt.\n\n6. The nitrate of cobalt (5.) was decomposed by ammonia; and the precipitate redissolved by an excess of the alkali, excepting an insoluble oxide of iron, amounting to 15 parts. The solution was then added to the ammoniated cobalt (3.).\n\n7. The insoluble precipitates of oxide of iron (3., 5. and 6.) were then mixed and examined. With borax they gave a blue glass, indicating a portion of cobalt still combined. They were then dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, precipitated by ammonia, and the wet precipitate was introduced into acetic acid, which at first dissolved the whole, but by boiling and evaporation nearly to dryness, four times successively, the oxide of iron became insoluble, while the cobalt remained in solution, and as it was more freed from iron, it assumed more of a fine rose colour. The solution of acetate of cobalt was supersaturated with ammonia, and the solution of ammoniated cobalt was added to the different portions of the same, obtained in former experiments. To expel the ammonia, the whole solution was boiled, and by adding potash, the whole oxide of cobalt was precipitated, which being washed and dried, amounted to 133 parts. The oxide being reduced in a crucible lined with charcoal, afforded pure metallic cobalt, of specific gravity 8.538.\n\n8. To determine the quantity of sulphur, 100 parts of the ore were separately boiled with 500 of nitric acid, and diluted with water, to separate the whole of the oxide of arsenic that depoited spontaneously. The sulphur was now converted into sulphuric acid; nitrate of barytes was added, and a precipitate of sulphate of barytes was formed, the quantity of which being ascertained, the proportion of sulphur might in this way be estimated.\n\nSect. II. Of the Reduction of the Ores of Cobalt.\n\nAs cobalt in the metallic state is not applied to any useful purpose, the reduction of its ores in this view is not an object of manufacture. But as it is extensively employed in the state of oxide, to give a fine blue colour to glasses, porcelain, &c., we shall here give a short account of the method of preparing the ores for this purpose. When the oxide of cobalt is finely mixed, after calcination, with a quantity of vitrifiable earth, it is then known by the name of zaffre, and it is in the form of a brown, gritty powder; but if it be melted with a quantity of vitrifiable matters, it yields a glass of a very deep blue colour, which being reduced to a fine powder, constitutes the final of commerce.\n\nPreparation of zaffre.—This substance is chiefly prepared in the large way, in different parts of Germany, but particularly in Saxony, and the following is the method of its preparation. The furnace employed is somewhat like a baker's oven, and is so constructed, that the flame of wood may be reverberated on all sides. The cobalt ore is placed on the hearth of the furnace, and by the action of the flame soon becomes red hot; a dense arsenical vapour arises, which is conducted through a horizontal wooden square trough or chimney, sometimes 100 fathoms long. In this chimney the arsenic is chiefly condensed, yet it is said, that some of the vapours, on account of their great volatility, escape. The calcination is continued till the exhalation of vapours nearly ceases: the ore is then reduced to powder, calcined a second time, again ground, and passed through a fine sieve. The powder is then mixed with two parts of powdered flint or quartz, after which it is moistened, and packed into barrels, where it acquires a great degree of hardness. This is the zaffre of commerce, in the state in which it is exported; the exportation of the simple coloured oxide being prohibited under heavy penalties, it is said that the flints are added with a view to conceal the real nature of the substance.\n\nPreparation of Smalt.—This is also sometimes called zaffre, and when reduced to a very fine powder, it is called assure blue. It is prepared with about equal parts of calcined cobalt ore, potash, and ground flints. This mixture is first frittered, and afterwards made into glasses, in pots like those of the glass-house. Eight or ten hours are required for its fusion. When the blue colour is perfect, the fused matter is taken out with iron ladles, and dropped into cold water, which makes it crack in all directions, so that it is easily reduced to fine powder. This operation is performed in a mill of very hard stone, inclosed in a wooden case. In the preparation of the smalt by the above process, a portion of bismuth, which usually accompanies the ores of cobalt, is found. Above it there is also a mixed alloy of iron, copper, and arsenic.\n\nChap. XIII. Of the Ores of Nickel.\n\nNickel, as it is found in the state of ore, is usually combined with arsenic and sulphur, copper and iron, or with oxygen in the form of oxide.\n\nSect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Nickel.\n\nWhen the ore contains, beside nickel, arsenic, sulphur, copper, and iron, with which it is usually accompanied, cobalt, silver, and bismuth, with some earthy matters, the analysis may be conducted according to the following process.\n\n1. The ore being reduced to an impalpable powder, is to be two or three times digested in nitric acid, considerably diluted, after which every thing soluble will be taken up. During the process, nitrous gas is given out.\n\n2. The insoluble part consists mostly of sulphur and silica, which after being dried, weighed and heated, the sulphur burns off, and the difference of weight before and after ignition, indicates its amount. The residue, after boiling in a little nitrous acid, is pure silica.\n\n3. Saturate the two nitrous solutions (1. and 2.) with\nManganese pure soda, evaporate considerably, and pour the solution into cold distilled water; the oxide of bismuth is precipitated.\n\n4. Add muriate of soda by drops to the filtered solution, while any precipitate is formed, which is the muriate of silver.\n\n5. Evaporate the solution nearly to dryness, boil it with strong nitric acid while nitrous gas is given out; red oxide of iron is precipitated during the process.\n\n6. Remove the oxide of iron, saturate the liquor with soda, and add nitrate of lead while any precipitate takes place. This is the arseniate of lead, which may be separated by filtration.\n\n7. Decompose the nitrous solution by carbonate of soda: digest the washed precipitate in liquid ammonia; the oxide of iron mixed with alumina, is left behind, and may be separated by caustic fixed alkali.\n\n8. Let the ammoniacal solution be slightly supersaturated with nitric acid, and a polished bar of iron introduced; in this way the copper will be separated: then decompose the liquid by carbonate of soda, and digest the precipitate in ammonia, and the iron employed in separating the copper will be removed.\n\n9. The solution now contains only nickel and cobalt. Let it be evaporated till the excess of ammonia be expelled. This is the case when the vapour ceases to discolour moist turmeric paper. Then add pure potash or soda to the solution largely diluted, while any precipitation takes place. The precipitate is the oxide of nickel. The cobalt now only remaining in the solution, may be separated in the usual way. To reduce the oxide of nickel, mix it with glaas of borax and a small quantity of carbonaceous matter, and then subject it in a crucible to the most powerful furnace heat. A button of pure nickel is thus produced.\n\nAs the ores of nickel are not very abundant, and as this metal is little employed for purposes of manufacture, the reduction of its ores does not extend beyond chemical analysis, which we have now detailed.\n\n**Chap. XIV. Of the Ores of Manganese.**\n\nManganese usually exists in the state of oxide, combined with a small proportion of iron, or in the state of carbonate, and sometimes in that of sulphuret.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Manganese.**\n\nRadiated gray ore of manganese.—This ore was analysed by Klaproth according to the following process.\n\n\"Two hundred grains of the ore, in grossly broken crystals, were heated to a thorough redness in a small coated glaas retort, connected with the pneumatic apparatus. The gas collected amounted only to nine grains, upon deducting the common air of the apparatus; but showed by the lively combustion of an iron wire confined in it, that it was pure oxygen gas.\n\n\"2. In the small intermediate hollow glaas-sphere of the apparatus, a considerable quantity of moisture has condensed, which weighed 14 grains, and was pure water.\n\n\"3. The manganese, having sustained that ignition, weighed 181 grains. The external lustre of the crystals was very much diminished, and their gray colour turned blackish.\n\n\"One hundred parts of this ore have, consequently, been decomposed into,\n\n| Black oxide of manganese | 90.50 |\n|-------------------------|-------|\n| Water                   | 7     |\n| Oxygen gas              | 2.25  |\n\n99.75 *\"\n\n*Effay, ii. 245.\n\nAs manganese is chiefly employed for economical purposes, in the state of oxide, the reduction of its ores forms no object of manufacture.\n\n**Chap. XV. Of the Ores of Molybdena.**\n\nFor an account of the treatment of the ores of molybdena, which exist in the state of sulphuret and in that of oxide only, see Chemistry; see also the analysis of the molybdate of lead, in the chapter on lead, in this article.\n\n**Chap. XVI. Of the Ores of Arsenic.**\n\nArsenic is found native, when it is alloyed with a small portion of iron, and sometimes also with a little gold or silver; in the state of sulphuret, or in the state of oxide.\n\n**Sect. I. Of the Analysis of the Ores of Arsenic.**\n\nThe method of analysing the ores of arsenic by Bergman, has been already given under Arsenic in the article Chemistry, as well as the method of subliming the metal in clothe vessels, to obtain it in a state of purity. The following is recommended as a successful process for preparing this metal for nice chemical purposes. Mix a quantity of arseniate of potash with about ½ part of charcoal, and let it be sublimed in a clothe glaas vessel, slowly heated to redness. The metallic arsenic thus obtained is in the form of beautiful brilliant crystals.\n\n**Sect. II. Preparation of White Arsenic and Orpiment.**\n\nWhite arsenic.—In the large way, this is prepared, by roasting the arsenical ores, previously ground to powder, and mixed with charcoal or saw dust, at a low red heat for several hours. The roasted ore is then subjected to a second sublimation, according to the following method; which is practised in Bohemia. The vessels in which the sublimation is performed, are strong square boxes of cast iron furnished with conical heads, which are closely luted with clay. These boxes are arranged in a spacious brick area, which is heated by flames proceeding from two furnaces, placed a little below them. When the impure arsenic has become red-hot, it is removed into the boxes by 15 pounds at a time, where it is brought into fusion, and about an hour after begins to sublime into the conical head. When the arsenic ceases to rise, another quantity is introduced into the vessel, and treated in the same way. These additions are continued till about 150 pounds of arsenic have been thus treated in each vessel; a period of about 12 hours is requisite for the sublimation of the whole quantity. When the vessels are cold, the conical head is taken off, and the sublimed arsenic is broken off with hammers, at the same time any impurities that adhere to it are separated, for a second operation.\n\nOrpiment.—\n**Orpiment.**—This substance is prepared in the same manner, and with the same apparatus, but the arsenic is previously mixed with half its weight of sulphur. In both cases a uniform red heat should be kept up during the operation, so that the materials in the lower vessel may be always in fusion; and when these materials are of any tolerable degree of purity, almost the whole is sublimed.\n\nAs the remaining metals have yet been found only in very small quantity, the reduction of their ores is not an object of much importance. A short account of the method of analyzing them will be found under Chemistry, and the characters of the ores, with their constituent parts, will be found under Mineralogy.\n\nFor the account of an elaborate analysis of the ores of tellurium, see Klaproth's Essays, ii. 1.\n\n---\n\n**ORELLANA, FRANCIS,** the first European, as is commonly thought, who discovered the river of the Amazons. In 1539, he embarked near Quito, upon the river Cocca, which farther down takes the name of Napo. From this he fell into another large river; and, leaving himself entirely to the direction of the current, he arrived at Cape North, on the coast of Guiana, after sailing nearly 1800 leagues. Orellana perished ten years after, with three vessels which had been intrusted to him in Spain, without being able to find again the mouth of this river. In sailing down the river, he met with some armed women, against whom an Indian cacique had told him to be on his guard; and he thence named it the river of the Amazons.\n\n**ORENSE,** an ancient town of Spain, in the kingdom of Galicia, with a bishop's see, famous for its hot baths, is seated at the foot of a mountain, on the river Minho, over which there is a handsome bridge of one arch. W. Long. 7° 27'. N. Lat. 42° 16'.\n\n**ORESTES,** in Ancient History, a son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. When his father was cruelly murdered by Clytemnestra and Ægisthus, young Orestes was saved from his mother's dagger by means of his sister Electra, called by Homer Lodoicea, having been privately conveyed to the house of Strophius, who was king of Phocis, and who had married a sister of Agamemnon. He was tenderly treated by Strophius, who carefully educated him with his son Pylades. The two young princes soon became acquainted, and from their familiarity arose the most inviolable attachment and friendship. When Orestes came to years of discretion, he visited Mycenae, and avenged his father's death by assassinating his mother Clytemnestra and her adulterer Ægisthus. Various accounts are given of the way in which these murders were committed. After their commission, however, he was acknowledged king of Mycenae; but being tormented by the Furies, a punishment which the ancients always thought followed parricide, he exiled himself to Argos, where he was still pursued by the vengeful goddesses. Apollo, however, purified him, and he was acquitted by the unanimous opinion of the Areopagites, whom Minerva herself instituted on this occasion, according to the narration of the poet Æschylus, who flatters the Athenians in his tragic story, by representing them as passing judgement even upon the gods themselves. According to Pausanias, Orestes was purified of the murder, not at Delphi, but at Troezen, where still was seen a large stone at the entrance of Diana's temple, upon which the ceremonies of purification had been performed by nine of the principal citizens of the place. There was also at Megalopolis, in Arcadia, a temple dedicated to the Furies, near which Orestes cut off one of his fingers with his teeth in a fit of insanity. These different traditions are confused by Euripides, who says that Orestes, after the murder of his mother, consulted the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, where he was informed that nothing could deliver him from the persecutions of the Furies, if he did not bring into Greece Diana's statue, which was in the Taurica Chersonesus, and which, as it is reported by some, had fallen down from heaven. This was an arduous enterprise. The king of Chersonesus always sacrificed on the altars of the goddess all such as entered the borders of his country. Orestes and his friend were therefore both carried before Thoas the king of the place, and they were doomed to be sacrificed. Iphigenia, Orestes's sister, was then priestess of Diana's temple, and it was her office to immolate these strangers. The intelligence that they were Grecians delayed the preparations, and Iphigenia was anxious to learn something about a country which had given her birth. She even interested herself in their misfortunes, and offered to spare the life of one of them, provided he would convey letters to Greece from her hand. This was a difficult trial: never was friendship more truly displayed, according to the words of Ovid, *ex Pont.* 3. el. 2.\n\n*Ire jubet Pylades carum moriturus Orestem.*\n*Hic negat; inque vicem pugnat uterque mori.*\n\nAt last, however, Pylades gave way to the pressing intrigues of his friend, and consented to carry the letters of Iphigenia to Greece. These were addressed to Orestes himself; and therefore these circumstances soon led to a discovery of the connections of the priests with the man whom she was going to immolate. Iphigenia was convinced that he was her brother Orestes; and when the cause of their journey had been explained, she herself resolved with the two friends to fly from Chersonesus, and to carry away the statue of Diana. Their flight was discovered, and Thoas prepared to pursue them; but Minerva interfered, and told him that all had been done by the will and with the approbation of the gods. Some imagine that Orestes came to Cappadocia from Chersonesus, and that there he left the statue of Diana at Comana. Others contradict this tradition; and Pausanias thinks that the statue of Diana Orthia was the same as that which had been carried away from the Chersonesus. Some again suppose that Orestes brought it to Aricia in Italy, where Diana's worship was established. It was after this that Orestes ascended the throne of Argos, where he reigned in perfect security, married Hermione the daughter of Menelaus, and gave his sister\nto his friend Pylades. The marriage of Orestes with Hermione is also a matter of dispute among the ancients. All are agreed that she had been promised to the son of Agamemnon; but Menelaus had married her to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles, who had shown himself so truly interested in his cause during the Trojan war. The marriage of Hermione with Neoptolemus displeased Orestes; he remembered that she had been early promised to him; he was therefore determined to recover her by force or artifice. This he did by procuring the afflatusion of Neoptolemus. According to Ovid's epistle of Hermione to Orestes, Hermione had always been faithful to her first lover, and even it was by her persuasions that Orestes removed her from the house of Neoptolemus, for she was dissatisfied with the partiality of Neoptolemus for Andromache, and her attachment for Orestes was increased. There are, indeed, various opinions likewise about this: he, however, certainly managed to secure her affections, and retired to his kingdom of Argos. His old age was crowned with peace and security, and he died in the 90th year of his age, leaving his throne to his son Tisamenus by Hermione. Three years after, the Heraclidae recovered the Peloponnesus, and banished the descendants of Menelaus from the throne of Argos. Orestes died in Arcadia, as some say, by the bite of a serpent; and the Lacedemonians, who had become his subjects at the death of Menelaus, were directed by an oracle to bring his bones to Sparta. They were some time after discovered at Tegea, and his stature appeared to be seven cubits, according to the traditions mentioned by Herodotus and others. The friendship of Orestes and of Pylades became proverbial: and the two friends received divine honours among the Scythians, and were worshipped in temples.\n\nORFA, a considerable town of Diarbeck (anciently Mecopotamia) in Asia, very pleasantly situated, and well fortified. It formerly belonged to Persia; but is now in the Turkish dominions, and is a place of very good trade. It has a stately castle standing on a hill, which makes a great show at a distance. They pretend to show the well where Rachel watered her father's camels when Jacob met her, and they call it Abraham's well. E. Long. 37° 45'. N. Lat. 36° 20'.\n\nORFFYREUS'S Wheel, in Mechanics, is a machine so called from its inventor, which he asserted to be a perpetual motion. This machine, according to the account given of it by Gravetande, in his Oeuvres Philo-physiques, published by Allemand, Amt. 1774, consisted externally of a large circular wheel, or rather drum, 12 feet in diameter, and 14 inches deep; being very light, as it was formed of an assemblage of deals, having the intervals between them covered with waxed cloth, to conceal the interior parts of it. The two extremities of an iron axis, on which it turned, rested on two supports. On giving a slight impulse to the wheel, in either direction, its motion was gradually accelerated; so that after two or three revolutions it acquired to great a velocity as to make 25 or 26 turns in a minute. This rapid motion it actually preserved during the space of two months, in a chamber of the landgrave of Hesse, the door of which was kept locked, and sealed with the landgrave's own seal. At the end of that time it was stopped, to prevent the wear of the materials. The professor, who had been an eye-witness to these circumstances, examined all the external parts of it, and was convinced that there could not be any communication between it and any neighbouring room. Orffyreus however was so incensed, or pretended to be so, that he broke the machine in pieces and wrote on the wall, that it was the impertinent curiosity of Professor Gravetande which made him take this step. The prince of Hesse, who had seen the interior parts of this wheel, but sworn to secrecy, being asked by Gravetande, whether, after it had been in motion for some time, there was any change observable in it, and whether it contained any pieces that indicated fraud or deception, answered both questions in the negative, and declared that the machine was of a very simple construction.\n\nORFORD, a town of Suffolk in England, 88 miles from London, situated between two channels, where the river Ore, after having joined the Ald, falls into the sea. It was once a large populous town, with a castle; of which, and of a nunnery near the quay, there are still some ruins. The towers of the castle and its church are a fair mark for colliers, coasters, and ships that come from Holland. There is a light-house at Orford-Neffe, which is also of great use to seamen, and is a shelter for them when a north-east wind blows hard upon the shore. The town was incorporated by Henry III. has a mayor, 18 portmen, 12 chief burgesses, a recorder, a town-clerk, and two sergeants at mace. Though it sent members to parliament, in the 26th of Edward I., yet it had no more elections till the reign of Edward IV. It still sends two members to parliament, and has the title of an earldom. There are still remaining the ruins of an holy house where the seamen's wives used to pray for the safety of their husbands. By the withdrawing of the sea, it has been deprived of its chief advantage, for it now deserves not the name of a harbour. It had the honour to give title of earl to the brave admiral Russell, which, after being many years extinct, was revived in the person of Sir Robert Walpole. E. Long. 1° 40'. N. Lat. 52° 15'.\n\nORGAL, among dyers, denotes the lees of wine dried.\n\nORGAN, in general, is an instrument or machine designed for the production of some certain action or operation; in which sense the mechanic powers, machines, and even the veins, arteries, nerves, muscles, and bones of the human body, may be called organs.\n\nORGAN, in Music, denotes the largest and most harmonious of all wind-instruments; on which account it is called the organ, οργανον, the instrument, by way of excellence; chiefly used for playing a thorough bass, with all its accompaniments.\n\nThat organs are the invention of remote antiquity has been argued, and seems now to be generally allowed; but the particular time and country in which the discovery was made appears to be lost amidst the ruins of time. In ancient authors there are a variety of passages where mention is made of the organ, but it is at least possible that an instrument is meant very different from that which now goes by the same name. From St Augustin's commentary on the 4th verse of the 150th Psalm we learn, that the Greeks had another name for those instruments in which bellows were employed; that the name organ was appropriated to this particular instrument merely from the usage of the Latin tongue; and that it was indifferently given to all instruments used to accompany the voice in concert. We mention this, not because we doubt of the antiquity\nantiquity of the organ, but merely to show that the time of its invention cannot be determined by the era of the authors where its name occurs. As the following observation, extracted from a periodical work which has long been in deserved esteem with the public, are intended to ascertain its early use, we submit them, without commentary, to the judgement of our readers. Caiusdorus has described our organ in a few words, lib. i. Epif. 45. Praising that art, which makes Organa extraneis vocibus infonare, et peregrinis fluitibus compleat, ut musica poësì arte cantare. And the emperor Julian has given an exact description of it in an epigram, which may be found in the Antologia, b. i. ch. 86. In his time these instruments were in such request, that Ammianus Marcellinus, b. xiv. ch. 6. complains that they occasioned the study of the sciences to be abandoned.\n\nHowever, those musical instruments whose melody is produced by wind, had been known at Rome long before. Witness that agreeable poem of Capa, which for its elegance has been ascribed to Virgil; where we find that the musician introduces the wind into her pipes by means of a pair of bellows, which he holds under her arms and blows. In the hydraulic organ, the water moves the air, instead of bellows. Cornelius Severus, in his Aetna, has given an exact description of it (A). And though there were two kinds of hydraulic and pneumatic instruments, the first of which played by the inspiration and action of bellows, and the other by the action of water, it is certain, nevertheless, that both of them were pneumatic, being inspired by the wind. And Heron of Alexandria, in his Pneumatics, has treated of hydraulics as belonging to pneumatics. This Heron lived in the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, king of Egypt. When Suetonius says, that Nero Organa hydraulica novi et ignoti generis circumduxit, he did not mean that they were unknown at Rome before Nero, but that those of Nero were of a new construction. Those were the hydraulics of a new fabric, which he exhibited to the people at the public games, as Suetonius relates a little after. Heliodorus, one of the worthy successors of Nero, like him was fond of these hydraulics; and Alexander Severus, his cousin and successor, had the same inclination. Claudian, who lived some time after, has left us this elegant description of them:\n\nFit qui magna levì detrudent murmura taìtu\nInnumeras voces fœgeis moderatur æneæ;\nIntonet erranti digito, pentüngue trabali\nVoce laborantis in carmina concusat undas.\n\nThis very construction which is observed in the pipes of an organ, gradually decreasing in magnitude, has been represented in an epigram of Optatianus Porphyrius, who lived in the time of Constantine. This epigram, which is quoted in Fichon's collection of ancient epigrams, is composed of verses of unequal length, successively increasing. This corresponds with those words of the old scholiast on Juvenal, sat. 8. ver. 270. Tunicæ Galli unntur in sacrïs in modum organi urinque decrecentibus virgulis purpureis.\n\nOn the whole, then, the antiquity of organs, or of instruments of a very similar nature, can scarcely be disputed; but nothing very particular reflecting the time, place, or manner, of the invention can possibly be determined from those incidental observations which occur in the writings of the ancients (B). It appears indeed to have been borrowed by the Latins from the Greeks, but not to have been in general use till the eighth century; and it has been affirmed, that, in France, it was not known till the time of Louis le Debonair, i. e. A.D. 815, when an Italian priest taught the use and construction of it, which he himself had learned at Constantinople. By some, however, it has been carried as far back as Charlemagne, and by others as far as Pepin. Bellarmine says that the organ began to be used in the service of the church about the year 660, as Platina relates out of the Pontifical: for when Pope Vitalian reformed the singing of the Roman church, he added to it organs in order to support and embellish it. Ammonius thinks, however, that this happened after the year 820, in the time of Louis the Pious. Perhaps the learned Bingham is our surest guide in determining this point. He positively affirms that there were no such things as organs.\n\n(A) Which is thus translated by Mr Jabez Hughes:\n\nAs in an organ*, first the rushing air\nA mass of waters does before it bear;\nAnd then the waters, in their turn, we find\nDrive through the hollow pipes the vanquish'd wind;\nWhich strongly from its strait confinement sent,\nComes loudly rattling through the narrow vent:\nStill as the waters press, the spirits sound,\nAnd spread the bubbling symphony around.\nSo air and water meet, &c.\n\nIt is by no means certain that Cornelius Severus was the author of this poem, though it is published under his name by Le Clerc. Seneca's authority, on which the Younger Scaliger founds his opinion, enforces no such conclusion. He only says, that \"Severus was not discouraged from writing on this subject, by its having been already treated by Ovid and Virgil.\" Barthius, in his notes on Claudian, refers it to Manilius, and in his Adversaria to some Christian writer. By others it has been ascribed to Virgil, and by Scaliger, the father, to Quintilis Varus. But though it is less clear and methodical than Virgil, and though it has been much mutilated by time, it certainly was penned by a masterly and truly poetical hand.\n\n(B) Vitruvius describes an organ in his 10th book, and St Jerome mentions one with 12 pair of bellows which might be heard a thousand paces, or a mile; and another at Jerusalem which might be heard at the Mount of Olives.\norgans in use in the ancient church; and that though church-music was as old as the apostles, instrumental music was not so. He also says that it was the general opinion of the learned in his days, that organs were not introduced into churches till after the time of Thomas Aquinas, A.D. 1250; and for this opinion, as far as the authority of Aquinas will go, we have a positive proof; for in his hymns we find these words: \"Our church does not use musical instruments, as harps, and psaltries, to praise God withal, that she may not seem to Judaize (c).\" From hence it has reasonably been concluded, particularly by the learned Gregory*, that they were not used in churches in his time. Mr Wharton has also observed that Marinus Sanctus (who flourished A.D. 1290) first introduced wind-organs into churches; from this circumstance he derived the name Torcellus, the name for organ in the Italian language.\n\nAbout this same time Durandus in his Rationale speaks of them as generally received in the church; and he, in Mr Gregory's opinion, is the first author who takes notice of it. These authorities are strong, and the opinions founded on them by the learned render them still more convincing: it appears, however, from the testimony of Gervas the monk of Canterbury, who flourished A.D. 1200, that organs were introduced upwards of 100 years even before that time; for in his description of Lanfranc's church, as it was before the fire in 1174, he has these words, \"Crux aultralis supra fornicem organa gestare solebat.\" We do not say that this invalidates the reasoning of the learned Bingham; of that our readers are to judge, and in forming their judgements they will be determined by the credit of the testimonies which are here opposed to each other. If we suppose that of Gervas the strongest, and in opposition to the other conclude from it, that organs were introduced into England long before the 13th century, it will give some countenance to an opinion which prevails pretty generally, viz. that in Italy, Germany, and England, they became frequent about the 10th century. See Music, p. 493. But however we are disposed to determine this matter (which is in itself but of little consequence), it is certain that the use of the organ was very common in the latter ages of the church, and the propriety of it was undisputed. In the last century, however, during the civil wars, organs were removed from the churches in England; and so generally reproached, that, at the Reformation, there could scarce be found either organists, organ builders, or fingers (d).\n\nThe organs in Germany (says Dr Burney) in magnitude, and the organists in abilities, seem unrivalled in any other part of Europe, particularly in the use of pedals. In Marpurg's Essays, vol. iii. there is a minute account of a variety of organs in Germany; of all which the longest pipe of the manuals is 16 feet long, and of the pedals 32. One of the largest organs in Germany, but which Marpurg has omitted in his list, is at Gorlitz in Upper Lusatia. It would be no purpose to enlarge our article with a more minute account of the state of organic music in different parts of the world; in various parts of the article Music, observations connected with this subject will be found, and to that we must refer. We may particularly notice, for the perusal of those who wish for further information on this subject, the observations which have been made on organs in the History of Music, at p. 493. We need scarcely refer to the life of Handel, which all our readers who are fond of music of any kind, particularly sacred, have undoubtedly perused.\n\nThe church-organ consists of two parts; the main body, called the great organ; and the positive or little organ, which forms a small case or buffet, commonly placed before the great organ. The size of an organ is generally expressed by the length of its longest pipe: thus they say, an organ of 8, 16, 32 feet, &c. The organ in the cathedral church at Ulm in Germany is 93 feet high and 28 broad: its longest pipe is 13 inches diameter, and it has 16 pair of bellows.\n\nThe several parts of the church-organ are as follow:\n\nHHH is the sound-board; which is composed of two parts, the upper board or cover HHH, and the under board HI, which is much thicker than the other; each of these consists of several planks laid with their edges to each other, and joined very close together. In the under side of the lower board there are made several channels, which run in the direction LL, MM, &c. and are continued as far as there are stops in the organ, and come almost to the edge HK. These channels are covered over very close with parchment or leather all the way, except a hole that is commonly at the fore-end next HK, upon which a valve or puff is placed. These channels are called partitions. When this valve or flap is shut, it keeps out the air, and admits it when open. On the upper side of the lower board there are likewise cut several broad square channels, lying across the former, but not so deep as to reach them; these lie in the direction LN, PQ, &c. To fit these channels, there are the same number of wooden sliders or registers J, J, J, &c. running the whole\n\n(c) The lawfulness of using organs in churches, has, however, been ably defended by an appeal to the use which the Jews made of instruments of music in divine service; and with much reason; for were the use criminal in us, as was asserted by many well-meaning men of the last century, and as it is still thought by some in this, it would unquestionably have been equally unlawful for the Jews. The Christians in Aquinas's time, however acted wisely in avoiding the use of them, if by so doing they would have given offence to their weaker brethren. For though they are highly ornamental, and in some churches may be productive of good effects, yet the use of them is far from being essential, and may be easily dispensed with.\n\n(d) Organs have never yet been used in the establishment of Scotland, since that became Presbyterian; but they are used in Holland, where that form of church-government also obtains. Bishop Horne, in a sermon which he preached at the opening of the new organ at Canterbury in 1784, says that he believes some Presbyterian dissenters in England have adopted it in their places of worship. See his Sermon, page 8.\nwhole length; and these may be drawn out or thrust in at pleasure. The number of these is the same as that of the stops in the organ.\n\nIKKK is the wind-chest, which is a square box fitted close to the under side of the lower board, and made air-tight, so that no air can get out but what goes through the valves along the partitions.\n\nVV are the valves or puffing which open into the wind-chest; they are all inclosed in it, and may be placed in any part of it, as occasion shall require. One of these valves, with the spring that flutes it, and the wire that opens it, is represented by fig. 2.\n\nC, D, E, F, &c., are the keys on which the fingers are placed when the organ is played; these keys lie over the horizontal bar of wood W, in which are fixed an equal number of wire-pins x, x, on which keys are fixed; and the keys move up and down on the bar, as on a centre. There is another bar, against which the keys fall when put down, and which is here marked 3; on this also are several wires, which go through the keys, to guide them; and on this bar a lift is fastened to hinder the keys from knocking against the wood.\n\nThe keys are made to communicate with the valves several ways, as we shall now describe. First, s, s, s, are the key-rollers, moving on the pivots t, t; these rollers lie horizontally, one above another, and are of such a length as to reach from the valve to the key: a, a, a, are arms or levers fixed to the key-rollers: w, w, the valve-wires fixed to the arms a, a, and to the valves V, and go through the holes h, h, in the bottom of the wind-chest: b, b, b, are likewise arms fixed to the key-rollers: d, d, d, the key-wires, fixed to the arms b, b, and to the keys C, D, E. Now, when the end of any one of the keys C, D, E, is put down, it pulls down the arm b, by the wire d, which turns about the roller s with the arm a, that pulls down the wire w, which opens the valve that is shut by the spring as soon as the prelude is taken off the key. In this construction there must be a worm spring fastened to the key, and to the bar W on the further side, to keep down the end of the key.\n\nAnother method of opening the valves is thus: x y, x y, are slender levers, moveable on the centres i, i; 5 x, 5 x, are wires going from the further ends of the keys to the ends x of the levers; y V, y V, are other wires, reaching from the ends y of the levers, through the holes h, to the valves V. So that putting down the key C, D, &c., raises the end 5, which thrusts up the end x of the lever, by the wire 5 x; this depresses the end y of the lever, which pulls down the wire y V, and opens the valve V.\n\nA third way of opening the valve is this: At the end of the key b, is a lever 8, 9, moving in the centre 7. This makes, with the key, a compound lever. From the end 9, a wire goes to the valve. Now the putting down the end 6 of the key, raises the end 8, which depresses the end 9, of the lever 8, 9, pulls down the wire, and opens the valve. There is only one of these drawn in the scheme, and but a few of the others, to avoid confusion.\n\nR, R, are the rollers, to move the sliders, by help of the arms c f, c f, which are fixed horizontally in the rollers: k e, k e, are also levers fixed in the rollers; l e, l e, are the handles, which lie horizontally, and pass through the holes l l; they are fastened to the lever k e, being moveable about a joint at e.\n\nNow, any handle l p, being drawn out, pulls the end e towards l, which turns about R k, along with the arm c f; and the end f pulls out the slider f g; and when p is thrust in, the arm c f likewise thrusts in the slider f g.\n\nUpon the several rows of holes which appear on the top of the upper board, there are set up an equal number of rows of pipes. The pipes of an organ are of two kinds; the one has a mouth like a flute, the other with reeds. The first, called pipes of mutation, consist (1.) of a foot AABB (fig. 3), which is a hollow cone, that receives the wind that is to sound the pipe: (2.) To this foot is fastened the body of the pipe BBDD. Between the foot and the body of the pipe is a diaphragm or partition FEF, that has a long but narrow aperture, by which the wind comes out; over this aperture is the mouth BBC, whose upper lip C, being level, cuts the wind as it comes out.\n\nThe pipes are of pewter, of lead mixed with a twelfth part of tin, and of wood. Those of pewter are always open at their extremities: their diameter is very small, and their sound very clear and shrill. Those of lead mixed with tin are larger; the shortest are open, the longest quite flopped; those of a mean size are partly flopped, and have beside a little ear on each side the mouth, to be drawn closer or let further asunder, in order to raise or lower the sound. The wooden pipes are square, and their extremity is stopped with a valve or tampion of leather. The sound of the wooden and leaden pipes is very soft; the large ones flopped are commonly of wood, the small ones of lead. The longest pipes give the gravest sound, and the shortest the most acute: their lengths and widths are determined by a fixed proportion to their sounds; and their divisions are regulated by a rule, which is called the diapason. The longest has commonly 16 feet; but in very large organs it has 32 feet. The pedal tubes are always open, though made of wood and of lead. Whatever note any open pipe sounds, when its mouth is flopped, it will sound an octave lower; and a pipe of twice its capacity will likewise sound an octave lower.\n\nA reed-pipe consists of a foot AABB (fig. 4.), that carries the wind into the flailot or reed CD, which is a hollow demi-cylinder, fitted at its extremity D, into a fort of mould, by a wooden tampion G. The flailot is covered with a plate of copper KLLL, fitted at its extremity II, into the mould, by the same wooden tampion. Its other extremity KK is at liberty: so that the air entering the flailot makes it tremble or shake against the reed; and the longer that part of the tongue LL, which is at liberty, is made, the deeper is the sound. The mould II, that serves to fix the flailot or reed, the tongue, tampion, &c., serves also to stop the foot of the pipe, and make the wind go out wholly at the reed. Lastly, in the mould is soldered the tube HH, whose inward opening is a continuation of that of the reed: the form of this tube is different in different ranks of pipes. The degree of acuteness or gravity in the sound of a reed pipe, depends on the length of the tongue, and that of the pipe CK, taken from the extremity of the flailot to the extremity of the tube. The quantity or intention of the sound depends on the width of the reed,\nthe tongue, and the tube; also on the thickness of the tongue, the figure of the tube, and the quantity of wind. To diversify the sounds of the pipes, a valve is added to the port-vent, which makes the wind go out in fits or thakes. In fig. 1. X represents a flute-pipe of wood, Z a flute-pipe of metal, Y a trumpet-pipe of metal. The pipes, to prevent them from falling, pass through holes made in boards, placed upon the upper board.\n\nThe pipes are made to communicate with the wind-chest in the following manner. There are holes bored that go through the upper and lower boards, and through the slider (when it is drawn out), into the partition below; so that any pipes placed upon those holes will then communicate with the partition, which by its valve, communicates with the wind-chest. But when the slider is thrust in, its holes do not answer to those in the upper and lower boards; therefore, the communication is stopped, so that no wind can get to the pipe.\n\nTo every large organ there must be at least two pairs of bellows, which are marked in fig. 1. by TU, TU, O, O, are the handles, moving upon the axis n, n. Each of these bellows consists of two boards, the lowest of which is immovable; and in this there is a valve r, opening inwards, and a tube leading to it, called the conveying tube. There is also a hole in this under board, from which a tube leads to the port-vent, which is a square tube marked q, rising upward, and inserted into the under side of the wind-chest at 2. In the tube leading to the port-vent, there is a valve that opens towards the port-vent, and suffers the air to go up the port-vent, but not to return. Now the handle O being pulled down, raises the upper board T, and the air enters through the valve r; and when the handle is let go, the weight of the upper board, which carries three or four pounds to every square foot, continually descending, drives the air through the port-vent to the found-board; and as the bellows work alternately, one pair is constantly descending, which occasions a continual blast through the port-vent. In chamber-organs there is but one pair of bellows; but they are formed of three boards, in the manner of a smith's bellows, and so have a continual blast. All the internal structure of the organ is concealed from the sight by the front of the instrument, which stands upon the part between the numbers 3 and 6 (fig. 1.).\n\nIn every organ, the number of partitions LL, MM, &c. there are in the found-board (fig. 1.), that of the valves VV, that of the rollers s, s, or of the levers x y or 8 g and their wires, and that of the keys ABC, &c. must be always equal. Large organs have commonly four or five sets of keys, beside those that belong to the pedals or large pipes, the stops to which are played by the feet; said to be the invention of Bernard, a German, about the year 1400. These command certain pipes, which, to increase the harmony, are turned below the diapason. The keys of an organ are usually divided into four octaves; which are, the first sub-octave, second sub-octave, middle octave, and first octave. Each octave is divided into 12 stops or frets, of which seven are black and five white; the former mark the natural notes, and the latter the artificial notes, that is, flats and sharps. The number of keys, therefore, when there are four octaves, must be 48. Some organists add one or more stops to the first and second sub-octaves. The pedals have two or three octaves, at the option of the organist; so that the number of stops is indeterminate. The keys are placed between GG (fig. 1.), but the scheme could not contain them all. There are also as many handles l, l, &c. rollers RR, &c. sliders f, f, &c. as there are stops upon the organ; and it must be observed, that between the sliders f, f, &c. there are as many sliders on the right hand, and the same number of handles and rollers, and other rows of pipes placed between LN, PQ, which could not be expressed in the figure.\n\nThe least pipes and partitions are placed toward the middle of the organ, and the greatest on the outside. The stops of an organ have various denominations, according to the sounds they are to produce; some of which are diapason, principal, fifteenth, twelfth, tierce, cornet, trumpet, French horn, vox humana, flute, bassoon, cremona, &c. The foreign organs, especially those of Germany, have many more: particularly that in the abbey church of Weingarten, a town in the Upper Palatinate, which has 66 stops, and contains no fewer than 6666 pipes. The organ at Haerlem is said to have 60 stops, many of them but little known to the English workmen, and distinguished by names that express the sound which they produce.\n\nWhen this magnificent instrument is played, the handle O of the bellows is first put down, which raises the upper board T, and gives room for the air to enter by the valve r. Then the other handle O is put down: In the mean time the board T, belonging to the first handle, descending, and shutting the valve r, drives the air through the other valve, up the port-vent, and into the wind-chest. Then drawing out any handle, as that of the flute-stop p, which draws out the slider f, all the pipes in the set LN are ready to play, as soon as the keys C, D, E, &c. are put down: therefore if the key D be put down, it opens the corresponding valve m V, through which the air enters into the pipe X, and makes it sound. In the same manner any other pipe in the set LN, will sound when its key is put down; but no pipe, in any other set, will sound till the slider be drawn out by its corresponding handle.\n\nAmong the modern improvements of the organ, the most remarkable are the swell and the tremulant: the former, invented by an English artist, consists in a number of pipes placed in a remote part of the instrument, and inclosed in a kind of box, which being gradually opened by the pressure of the foot, increases the sound as the wind does the sound of a peal of bells, or suppresses it in like manner by the contrary action. The tremulant is a contrivance by means of a valve in the port-vent or pallage from the wind-chest, to check the wind, and admit it only by fits; so that the notes seem to stammer, and the whole instrument to sob, in a manner very offensive to the ear. There is a tremulant in the organ at the German chapel in the Savoy. See Hawkins's History of Music, and Burney.\n\nHydraulic Organ denotes a musical machine that plays by water instead of wind. Of these there are several in Italy, in the grottoes of vineyards. Ctesibius of Alexandria, who lived in the time of Ptolemy Euergetes, is said to have invented organs that played by compressing the air with water, as is still practiced. Archimedes\nmedes and Vitruvius have left us descriptions of the hydraulic organ.\n\nIn the cabinet of Queen Christina is a beautiful and large medallion of Valentinian, on the reverse whereof is seen one of these hydraulic organs; with two men, one on the right, the other on the left, seeming to pump the water which plays it, and to listen to its sound. It has only eight pipes, placed on a round pedestal. The inscription is PLACEA SPETRI, if it be not wrong copied, which we suspect to be the case.\n\nORGASM, ὀξύτομος, denoting violence or turbulence; from ὀξύς, turgescere, \"I swell,\" an ecstasy or impetuous desire of coition, occasioned by a turbulence of the seminal vessels, which are no longer able to restrain their contents. The ancients also extend orgasm to the other humours, and even excrements, which being accumulated, and coming to ferment, demand excretion. Quincy uses orgasm for an impetuous or too quick motion of the blood or spirits; whereby the muscles are distended with an uncommon force.\n\nORGIA, feasts and sacrifices in honour of Bacchus, held every third year, and chiefly celebrated by wild distracted women, called Baccheae. The chief solemnities were performed in the night, to conceal, perhaps, their shocking impurities; and a mountain was generally chosen as the place of celebration. They were instituted by Orpheus; and from him are sometimes called Orphica. Authors are not agreed as to the derivation of the word; but if we consider the frantic proceedings of the Bacchanalians, ἐγκυνή, furore, bids fair for the true etymology. See BACCHANALIA.\n\nOrgia, according to Servius, was a common name for all kinds of sacrifices among the Greeks, as ceremoniae was amongst the Romans.\n\nORGUES, in the military art, are thick long pieces of wood, pointed at one end, and shod with iron, clear one of another; hanging each by a particular rope or cord, over the gateway of a strong place, perpendicularly, to be let fall in case of the approach of an enemy.\n\nOrgues are preferable to heres, or portcullices, because these may be either broke by a petard, or they may be stopped in their falling down: but a petard is useless against an orgue; for if it break one or two of the pieces, they immediately fall down again and fill up the vacancy; or if they stop one or two of the pieces from falling, it is no hinderance to the rest; for being all separate, they have no dependence upon one another.\n\nOrgues are also used for a machine composed of several harquebus or musket barrels bound together, by means whereof several explosions are made at the same time. It is used to defend breaches and other places attacked.\n\nORGYA, ὀξύα, an ancient Grecian measure containing six feet.\n\nORIBASIA, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra class, and in the natural method ranking under the 47th order, Stellatae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nORIBASUS, a celebrated physician greatly esteem'd by the emperor Julian, in whose reign he flourished. He abridged the works of Galen, and of all the most respectable writers on physic. This was done at the request of the emperor. He accompanied Julian into the east, but his skill proved ineffectual in attempting to cure the fatal wound which his benefactor had received. After Julian's death he fell into the hands of the barbarians.\n\nORICHALCUM, or Aurichalcum, a metallic substance resembling gold in colour, but very inferior in value. It was well known to the old Romans, who often took advantage of its resemblance to gold: for some sacrilegious characters, who could not resist the temptation of taking gold from temples and other public places, chose to conceal their guilt by replacing it with orichalcum. It was thus that Julius Cæsar acted when he robbed the capital of 3000 pounds weight of gold; in which he was followed by Vitellius, who depopulated the temples of their gifts and ornaments, and replaced them with this inferior metal. It has been a matter of dispute with philosophers and others, what this metal could be, or how it was procured or made; it is probable at least that it was greatly analogous to our bras, if not wholly the same with it (See BRASS). The value of our bras is much less than that of gold, and the resemblance of bras to gold, in colour, is obvious at first sight. Both bras and gold, indeed, are susceptible of a variety of shades of yellow; and, if very pale bras be compared with gold, mixed with much copper, such as the foreign goldsmiths, especially, use in their toys, a disparity may be seen; but the nearness of the resemblance is sufficiently ascertained in general, from observing that substances gilded with bras, or as it is commonly called Dutch leaf, are not easily distinguished from such as are gilded with gold leaf.\n\nThe Romans were not only in possession of a metallic substance, called by them orichalcum, and resembling gold in colour, but they knew also the manner of making it, and the materials from which they made it were the very same from which we make bras. There are, indeed, authors of great repute who think very differently; and who consider the art of making bras as an invention wholly modern. Thus M. Cronstedt does not think it just to conclude from old coins and other antiquities, that it is evidently proved that the making of bras was known in the most ancient times*; and the *Miner, authors of the French Encyclopédie assure us, that our p. 218, bras is a very recent invention (A). It appears, however, from Pliny's Nat. Hist. lib. xxxiv. §. 2, and from the concurring testimony of other writers, that orichalcum was not a pure or original metal; but that its basis was copper, which the Romans changed into orichalcum by means of cadmia, a species of earth which they threw upon the copper, and which it absorbed. It has indeed been contended, that the cadmia of Pliny was native arsenic; an opinion which scarcely merits confutation, but which must appear extremely groundless, when we reflect\n\n(A) Art. Orichalque.—\"The vessels here called brazen, after ancient authors, cannot have been of the materials our present bras is composed of; the art of making it is a modern discovery.\" See Laughton's History of Ancient Egypt, p. 58.\nreflex that it is impossible to make either brasfs or copper from arsenic, and that Pliny expressly calls it alone from which brasfs was made. The testimony of Ambrose bishop of Milan, in the 4th century, and of Priscus bishop of Adrumetum, in Africa, in the 6th, and of Isidorus bishop of Seville in the 7th, all seem to confirm Pliny's account. We may therefore safely conclude that the Romans knew the method of making brasfs by mixing cadmia or calamine with copper; yet it is probable they were not the inventors of this art, but that they borrowed it from some other country. It appears from a variety of testimonies that brasfs was made in Asia, in a manner very similar to that at Rome; and a variety of places are mentioned in that extensive country where it was commonly made; and it is supposed by some that in India, as well as in other parts of Asia, it was made in the remotest ages.\n\nWith respect to orichalcum, it is generally supposed that there were two sorts of it, one fictitious, the other natural. The fictitious, whether we consider its qualities or composition, appears to have been the same with our brasfs. As to the natural orichalcum, there is no imposibility in supposing, that copper ore may be so intimately blended with an ore of zinc, or of some other metallic substance, that the compound, when smelted, may yield a mixed metal of a paler hue than copper, and resembling the colour of either gold or silver. In Du Halde's history of China, we meet with the following account of the Chinese white copper. \"The most extraordinary copper is called de-tong, or white copper: it is white when dug out of the mine, and still more white within than without. It appears by a vast number of experiments made at Pekin, that its colour is owing to no mixture; on the contrary all mixtures diminish its beauty; for, when it is rightly managed, it looks exactly like silver: and were there not a necessity of mixing a little tutenag, or some such metal with it, to soften it and prevent its brittleness, it would be so much the more extraordinary, as this sort of copper is perhaps to be met with nowhere but in China, and that only in the province of Tun-nan.\" Notwithstanding what is here said, of the colour of this copper being owing to no mixture, it is certain that the Chinese white copper, as brought to us, is a mixed metal; so that the ore from which it is extracted must consist of various metallic substances, and from some such ore it is possible that the natural orichalcum, if ever it existed, may have been made. But, notwithstanding that the existence of natural orichalcum cannot be shown to be impossible, yet there is some reason to doubt whether it ever had a real existence or not.\n\nWe know of no country in which it is found at present; nor was it anywhere found in the age of Pliny; nor does he seem to have known the country where it ever had been found. He admits, indeed, its having been formerly dug out of the earth; but it is remarkable, that in the very passage where he is mentioning by name the countries most celebrated for the production of different kinds of copper, he only says in general concerning orichalcum, that it had been found in other countries, without specifying any particular country. Plato acknowledges, that orichalcum was a thing only talked of even in his time; it was nowhere then to be met with, though in the island of Atlantis it had been formerly extracted from its mine. The Greeks were in possession of a metallic substance, called orichalcum, before the foundation of Rome; for it is mentioned by Homer and by Hesiod; and by both of them in such a manner as shows that it was then held in great esteem. Other ancient writers have expressed themselves in similar terms of commendation; and it is principally from the circumstance of the high reputed value of orichalcum that authors are induced to suppose the ancient orichalcum to have been a natural substance, and very different from the fictitious one in use at Rome, and probably in Asia, and which it has been shown was nothing different from our brasfs.\n\nBut this conclusion cannot be validly drawn from their encomiums upon it; for at whatever time the method of making it was first discovered, both its novelty and scarceness, joined to its utility, would enhance its value, at least there can be no absurdity in supposing, that when first introduced it was greatly prized, even though it be granted that it possessed no other properties than such as appertain to brasfs.\n\nReflecting the etymology of the word there is great diversity of opinions. Those who write it aurichalcum think it is composed of the Latin word aurum, \"gold,\" and the Greek χαλκός, \"brasfs or copper.\" The most general opinion is, however, that it is composed of ὄρος, \"a mountain\" and χαλκός, alluding perhaps to its being found in mountains or mountainous countries. The above account is chiefly extracted from a paper in the second volume of Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, written by the present bishop of Landaff, Dr Watson, and communicated by Dr Percival. To this paper then we refer our readers who desire a more copious account of it. To the above two etymological meanings of the word we shall subjoin the following, mentioned by the learned bishop, and which, in our opinion, is equally well founded, and certainly as ingenious, as the other two.\n\nThe Hebrew word Or, Aur, signifies light, fire, flame; the Latin terms uro, \"to burn,\" and aurum, \"gold,\" are derived from it, inasmuch as gold resembles the colour of flame: and hence it is not improbable, that orichalcum may be composed of an Hebrew and Greek term, and that it is rightly rendered, flame-coloured copper. In confirmation of this it may be observed, that the Latin epithet lucidum, and the Greek one φωτεινός, are both applied to orichalcum by the ancients.

See PHILOSOPHY.\n\nORIGEN, one of the most celebrated ecclesiastical writers, greatest geniuses, and most learned men of\nthe primitive church, during the third century, was born at Alexandria in the year 185; and was named Adamantius, either from his indefatigable application to study, or from the firmness he discovered amidst the torments he suffered for the faith. Leonidas, his father, trained him at home with great care, and made him apply to the study of the Holy Scriptures from his infancy, in which he made surprising progress. The son's inclination and turn suited exactly with the father's design; for he pursued his studies with a most extraordinary zeal and ardour: and, being endowed with a quick apprehension and a strong imagination, did not content himself with that sense which at first presented itself, but farther endeavoured to dive into mysterious and allegorical explications of the sacred books. He would sometimes even puzzle his father, by too much soliciting him for recondite meanings; which obliged the good man to reprehend him a little, and withhold advice him not to attempt to penetrate too far in the study of the Holy Scriptures, but to content himself with their most clear, obvious, and natural sense. Hence it appears, how early he was seized with that furor allegoricus, as a learned modern calls it, that rage of expounding the Scriptures allegorically, which grew afterwards to be even a distemper, and carried him to excesses which can never be excused (a). He had afterwards in philosophy Ammonius the celebrated Christian philosopher, and St Clement of Alexandria for his master in divinity. At 18 years of age he succeeded that great man in the office of catechist; an important employment, which consisted in teaching divinity, and expounding the Scriptures. Leonidas his father had suffered martyrdom the year before, during the persecution of Severus in 202; and Origen had thrown such eagerness to follow his father to martyrdom, that his mother was obliged to hide his clothes to prevent his going abroad. Origen had a great concourse of auditors who attended his school, some of whom were of the faithful, and the others pagans. He confirmed and strengthened the first in their faith, and converted most of the others; and there were such a number of martyrs amongst his disciples, that it might be said, that he kept rather a school of martyrdom than of divinity. He taught the doctrines of Christianity to the girls and women as well as to the men; and taking in a too literal sense what Christ says of becoming voluntary eunuchs, castrated himself, to prevent his deserving or suffering scandal. He took a voyage to Rome in 211, in the beginning of Caracalla's reign, under the pontificate of Zephyrinus. At his return he published many works, by which he acquired an extraordinary reputation, that drew to him a great number of auditors. But Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, conceiving a jealousy of him, endeavoured by various pretences to injure him. At length Origen went to Antioch, whether the empress Mamaea had sent for him to hear him discourse on the Christian religion. He did not however stay long there, but returned to Alexandria, where he continued to teach till the year 228, when he left that city, and travelled into Achaia. In that journey he went into Palestine, and was ordained by the bishops of that province at 42 years of age. His being ordained by foreign bishops, without the permission of Demetrius, renewed that prelate's resentment against him; on which Origen hastily returned to Alexandria, to endeavour to mollify him: but Demetrius drove him from thence in 231, and caused him to be excommunicated, and even deposed in a council held in Egypt. Origen then retired to Cesarea in Palestine, where he raised a celebrated school, and had St Gregory Thaumaturgus, and a great number of other persons who were illustrious for their virtue and learning, for his disciples. He afterwards travelled to Athens; and then, at the desire of Firmilianus, laid some time at Cesarea in Cappadocia; whence he was invited into Arabia, to convince and bring back to the truth Beryllus bishop of Bostra; who maintained that the Word had no existence before his incarnation. Origen had the happiness to make him sensible of his mistake; and some years after was sent into Arabia by an assembly of bishops, to dispute against the Arabians, who maintained that the souls of the dead remained in a state of insensibility till the general resurrection. At length the seventh persecution of the Christians began in the reign of Decius, and none were used with greater severity than Origen. He supported with incredible constancy the dreadful torments which the persecutors of the Christians invented against them; torments that were the more insupportable, as they were made to continue a long time, and as they took the greatest care to prevent his expiring in the midst of his tortures: but in the midst of the most excruciating torments, he discovered an heroic courage, and suffered nothing to escape him that was unworthy a disciple of Jesus Christ. He died at Tyre in 254, aged 69. He was the author of a great number of excellent works. The principal of those which have been handed down to us are, 1. A Treatise against Celsus, of which Spencer has given a good edition in Greek and Latin, with notes: this learned treatise has been translated into French by Elias Bouheneau, a protestant minister, born at Rochelle. 2. A great number of Homilies, with Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures. 3. Philocalia, and several other\n\n(a) He is the first Christian (whose notions on this subject have come down to us) who believed in the restitution of all things. This is his fifth distinguishing tenet; to which is added this singular notion, that as Christ had been crucified in this world to save mankind, he is to be crucified in the next to save the devils. The other obnoxious tenets of Origen are these five: viz. 1. That in the Trinity the Father is greater than the Son, and the Son than the Holy Ghost. 2. The pre-existence of souls, which Origen considered as sent into mortal bodies for the punishment of sins committed in a former state of being. 3. That the soul of Christ was united to the world before the incarnation. 4. That the sun, moon, and stars, &c., were animated and endowed with rational souls. 5. That after the resurrection, all bodies will be of a round figure. It is probable that the mystic theology of the modern Quakers and other sects is derived from Origen. See Mosheim, Ecclesiastical History, vol. i.\nOrigen other treatises. 4. Fragments of his Hexaples, collected by Father Montfaucon, in two volumes folio. Of all Origen's books, the loss of the Hexaples is most to be regretted. This work was thus named from its containing six columns; in the first of which was the Hebrew text of the Bible; in the second, the same text in Greek characters; in the third, the Greek version of the Septuagint; in the fourth, that of Aquila; in the fifth, that of Symmachus; and in the sixth Theodotion's Greek version. This admirable work gave the first hint for our Polyglot Bibles.\n\n5. The book of Principles; of which we have only an incorrect Latin version. In all his writings he discovers a surprising degree of modesty, candour, and humility; a noble and sublime genius, profound learning, and vast erudition. His manners were extremely pure, and he had a warm zeal for spreading the truths and morals of the Gospel.\n\nMuch has been written both for and against this celebrated father, both by his contemporaries and others: he has indeed suffered great abuse, which he did not deserve, and which we shall not retail; containing ourselves with the following account of his character by Dupin, and some remarks on it by Dr Jortin. \"Origen (says Dupin) had very quick parts, a very strong and enlarged imagination; but he relied too much on the vivacity of his genius, and often lost himself, out of too great earnestness to fathom and subtilize every thing. He had a very happy invention, and a more happy delivery of what he invented: but he had not that exactness in his inventions, nor that gracefulness of delivery as might be wished. He carried on his works with so great ease, that he is said to have dictated to seven or eight persons at a time; and he was so ready in expressing himself, that he made the greatest part of his homilies extempore: upon which account his style was not very correct or coherent. He had a vast memory, but often trifled too much to it. He was a person of most profound learning: he particularly studied Plato's philosophy, and was indeed too much addicted to it for a Christian. He understood likewise the doctrines of other philosophers. He applied himself mightily to the study of human learning. He was neither ignorant of history nor mythology; and he had as great a knowledge in all the profane sciences, as those who studied nothing else. But he particularly excelled in the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, which he learned all by heart; and that he might neglect nothing for attaining a right understanding of the letter thereof, he carefully examined all the versions of the Bible, and compared them all together with the Hebrew text, subjoining a literal commentary upon the most difficult places. He was not very well skilled in the Hebrew; yet he knew enough of it to understand it, and to observe the difference of the text and the translations. Nevertheless, he did not adhere to the literal explication of the Bible, but thought it necessary, for the sake of gaining it credit with the heathens, who despised its plainness and simplicity, and of rendering it more useful to the world, to give mystical and allegorical interpretations of every thing in it.\"\n\nDr Jortin tells us, \"That Origen was very learned and ingenious, and indefatigably industrious. His whole life from his early years was spent in examining, teaching, and explaining the Scriptures; to which he joined the study of philosophy and of all polite literature. He Origenians was humble, modest, and patient, under great injuries and cruel treatment, which he received from Christians and Pagans: for though he ever had a considerable number of friends and admirers, on account of his amiable qualities and useful accomplishments, he was persecuted and calumniated by men, who had neither his learning nor his virtue, degraded from the order of presbyters, driven from his home, and excommunicated by one Demetrius bishop of Alexandria, who envied him, says Eusebius, for the reputation which he had gained. His inquisitive genius, and his mixing philosophy with Christianity, led him perhaps into some learned singularities and ingenious reveries; but he was by temper far from dogmatizing in such points, from fomenting schisms, and setting up himself for the head of a party. He lived in times when Christians were not so shackled with systems and determinations as they were afterwards, nor so much exposed to disingenuous and illiberal objections; and had more liberty to pursue their inquiries and to speak their mind.—He was ever extremely sober and exemplary, practicing what he preached to others; and he lived and died poor, and destitute even of common conveniences.\"—The most complete edition of his works is that of Father Delarue, a Benedictine, in Greek and Latin. The celebrated Montfaucon likewise published, in 2 vols folio, some remains and fragments of his Hexapla.\n\nHe ought not to be confounded with another Origen, a Platonic philosopher, and the disciple and friend of Porphyry, who studied philosophy under Ammonius: perhaps this Origen was the founder of the Origenians.\n\nORIGENIANS (Origeniani), ancient heretics, who even surpassed the abominations of the Gnostics.\n\nEpiphanius speaks of them as subsisting in his time; but their numbers, he says, were inconsiderable. He seems to fix their rise about the time of the great Origen; but does not say that they derived their name from him. On the contrary, he distinguishes them from the Origenists, whom he derives from Origen Adamantius; adding, indeed, that they first took their name from one Origen; by which he intimates, that it was not the great Origen. And St Augustine expressly affirms, that it was another. Their doctrines were shameful: they rejected marriage; they used several apocryphal books, as the acts of St Andrew, &c. and endeavoured to excuse their open crimes, by saying, that the Catholics did the same in private.\n\nORIGENISTS, in church-history, a Christian sect in the fourth century, so called from their drawing their opinions from the writings of Origen. The Origenists maintained, that the souls of men had a pre-existent state: that they were holy intelligences, and had finished in heaven before the body was created: that Christ is only the Son of God by adoption; that he has been successively united with all the angelical natures, and has been a cherub, a seraph, and all the celestial virtues one after another; that, in future ages, he will be crucified for the salvation of the devils, as he has already been for that of men; and that their punishment, and that of the damned, will continue only for a certain limited time.\n\nORIGINAL, a first draught or design of any thing, which serves as a model to be imitated or copied.\nORIGINAL Sin, the crime of eating the forbidden fruit, of which, it is said, all mankind are guilty at their conception, by the imputation of Adam's transgression; which is accounted for by supposing, that Adam, as he was to be the father, was also the federal head and representative, of the whole human race: and that, on his sinning, all that were to spring from him partook of his crimes.

It is seated between the mountains on the banks of the river Segura, in a place fortified by nature, and in a fertile plain, abounding in all things, especially corn.

See Fortification.\n\nORIOLUS, or Oriole, a genus of birds belonging to the order of piee. See ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nORION, in fabulous history, was the son of Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury. For as these gods were visiting the earth, they entered the house of Hyrieus, a native of Tanagra, in Boeotia, under the character of benighted travellers, on account of his being famed for hospitality to strangers. Hyrieus treated them in the best manner in his power; and even killed an ox, the only one he had, for their entertainment. At which the gods were so pleased, that they offered the old man whatever he would ask; who letting them know that he desired nothing so much as a son, they, to gratify his wish, caused the ox's hide to be brought before them, in which, having deposited their urine, they bade him keep it underground for nine months. He then dug for the skin, and found in it a beautiful child, whom he called Orion ab urina. The name was afterwards changed into Orion by the corruption of one letter, as Ovid observes: Perdidit antiquam litera prima forum. Orion soon became conspicuous; and Diana took him among her attendants, and even became deeply enamoured of him. His gigantic stature, however, displeased Oenopion king of Chios, whose daughter Hero or Merope he requested in marriage. The king, not willing to deny him openly, promised to make him his son-in-law as soon as he delivered his island from wild beasts. This task, which Oenopion supposed to be impracticable, was soon performed by Orion, who eagerly demanded his reward. Oenopion, on pretence of complying, intoxicated his illustrious guest, and put out his eyes on the sea-shore, where he had laid himself down to sleep. Orion found himself blind when he awoke. He went, directed by the sound, to a neighbouring forge, where he placed one of the workmen on his back, and by his directions went to a place where the rising sun was seen with the greatest advantage. Here he turned his face towards the luminous star; and, according to report, he immediately recovered his eye-sight, and hastened to punish the perfidious cruelty of Oenopion. Orion was reported to be an excellent workman in iron, and to have fabricated a subterraneous palace for Vulcan.\n\nAurora, whom Venus had inspired with love, carried him away into the island of Delos, that the might enjoy his company with greater security; but Diana, who was jealous of this, destroyed him with her arrows. Some say, that Orion had provoked Diana's resentment, by offering violence to Opis, one of her female attendants; or, as others say, because he had attempted the virtue of the goddess herself. According to Ovid, Orion died of the bite of a scorpion, which the earth produced to punish his vanity, in boasting that no animal on earth could conquer him. Some say that Orion was son of Neptune and Euryle, and that he had received from his father the privilege and power of walking over the sea without wetting his feet. Others assert, that he was a son of Terra, like the rest of the giants. He had married a nymph called Sida, before his connection with the family of Oenopion; but Sida was the wife of her own death, by boasting herself fairer than Juno. Diodorus says, that Orion was a celebrated hunter, superior to the rest of mankind, by his strength and uncommon stature. He built the port of Zancle, and fortified the coast of Sicily against the frequent inundations of the sea, by heaping a mound of earth called Pelorum, on which he built a temple to the gods of the sea. After death Orion was placed in heaven, where one of the constellations still bears his name. The constellation of Orion was placed near the feet of the bull. It was composed of 17 stars in the form of a man holding a sword; for which reason the poets often speak of Orion's sword. As the constellation of Orion, which rises about the 9th day of March, and sets about the 21st of June, is generally supposed to be accompanied at its rising with great rains and storms, it has acquired the epithet of aquilus, given it by Virgil. Orion was buried in the island of Delos; and the monument which the people of Tanagra in Boeotia showed, as containing his remains, was nothing but a cenotaph. The daughters of Orion distinguished themselves as much as their father; and when the oracle had declared that Boeotia should not be delivered from a dreadful pestilence before two of Jupiter's children were immolated on the altars, they joyfully accepted the offer, and voluntarily sacrificed themselves for the good of their country. Their names were Menippe and Metioche. They had been carefully educated by Diana; and Venus and Minerva had made them very rich and valuable presents. The deities of hell were struck at the patriotism of these two females; and instantly two stars were observed to arise from the earth, which still smoked with their blood, and they were placed in the heavens in the form of a crown. According to Ovid, their bodies were burned by the Thebans, and from their ashes arose two persons, whom the gods soon after changed into constellations.\n\nORION, in Astronomy, one of the constellations of the southern hemisphere. The word is formed from the Greek σειρα, \"to make water;\" the ancients supposing that it raised tempests at its rising and setting.

See Botany Index.\n\nORKNEY ISLANDS, called Orcades by the ancients, certain islands on the north of Scotland (A), from which they are separated by a frith 20 miles in length and 10 Orkney in breadth.\n\nAs writing seems to have been unknown in the northern islands, during those periods which the antiquarian would call the most curious and important, the chief part of our information respecting the ancient state of the Orkneys must be derived from tradition and conjecture. Their mountainous situation, and natural jealousy of strangers, obstructed the progress both of knowledge and religion: for instead of receiving either from their southern neighbours, we are certain that they derived their knowledge of Christianity from Norway, during the expeditions undertaken by that nation (in the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century) to make settlements in the Orkneys and on the coast of Caithness (B). The best (because it is in all probability\n\n(A) The northern isles of Scotland have been often mentioned by ancient authors, and called by different names from those they now go by; so that it is sometimes difficult to know which of them are meant. The ancient name, however, of the islands which are the subject of this article, has never been disputed. The Ebudei, it is agreed, are the modern Hebrides; and there is no doubt of the ancient Orcades being the same with the Orkneys. Of Thule, however, we are not so certain; and whether it means the Shetland isles, or Iceland, remains undetermined. Pythias, a Malilian, pretends to have visited these islands, and particularly Thule; but he does not mention the Orcades. The geographer Mela, who was contemporary with the emperor Claudius, is the next writer who describes the northern islands. Of the Orkneys he gives a remarkably just account, and says they were thirty in number, with narrow channels between them; but he is less accurate with respect to the rest. Pliny the Elder is the third who mentions the northern islands. He makes the number of the Orkneys to be forty, and of the Hebrides to be thirty. Solinus, the supposed contemporary with Agricola, is the next after Pliny. In his time, and according to his account, these islands had not a single inhabitant, and were overgrown with rushy grass. It seems on the whole to be pretty generally allowed, that Julius Agricola, who first sailed round Britain, discovered the Orcades, till then unknown, and subdued them*. Claudius was so far from reducing them (as is asserted by Jerome in his Chronicle), that Juvenal has these lines in Hadrian's time:\n\nArma quid ultra\nLittora Juvenae promovimus et modo captas\nOrcades, et minima contentos nocte Britannos.\nSAT. II. 160.\n\nIn vain, O Rome, thou dost this conquest boast\nBeyond the Orcades' short-nighted coast.\nDRYDEN.\n\nTacitus informs us, that before the completion of the first century, the Roman fleets sailed round Scotland, and landed in the Orcades to refresh.\n\n(B) It has been asserted, that the Orkneys, as well as the isles of Shetland, were originally peopled from Norway, in the ninth, tenth, or eleventh century. Others again imagine, with as much probability, that the Picts were the original inhabitants, and call Orkney the ancient kingdom of the Picts. Certain singular houses, now overgrown with earth, are called Piets houses; and the Pentland frith (formerly Pictland or Pielland) is supposed to retain their name. Claudian's lines, cited by Mr Camden, prove, that the Picts, with some other German colony, particularly the Saxons, were at that time in possession of these isles; and so Ninnius expressly says. Many of the present inhabitants use the Norse language, which differs but little from the Teutonic or Pictish language, and was in general use to the last century; but except in Foula, where a few words are still known by the aged people, it is quite lost. The English tongue, with a Norwegian accent, is that of these isles; but the appearance of the people, in their manners and genius, evidently shows their northern origin. Ninnius c. 5, puts their arrival at Orkney not less than 900 years after the coming of Brutus into Britain, which he says was in the time of Eli the Jewish high priest. The ancient surnames are of German original. Some date the first settlement of the Picts here A.D. 4867; when, emigrating from their native country, they planted a colony in Orkney, and thence crossing Pictland frith, and traversing Caithness, Rothes, Murray, Marr, and Angus, settled in Fife and Lothian; thence called by our writers Pictlandia. Others think they did not settle here till the time of Reuther king of Scotland, when the Picts joining with a party of the Scots, were repelled, with the loss of their king Gethus, and many of the Picts and Scottish nobility, with great slaughter; but the invasions of the Britons, at the same time, constrained the Picts to fly to Orkney, where they chose for king Gothus their deceased sovereign's brother,\n\n* The Romans, never that we know, visited these islands again but once, which was probably after Honorius had defeated the Saxons in the seas of Orkney.\nprobability the most authentic) account that we have of this early part of the history of the Orkneys, seems to be in Torfeus. See Torfeus. His history must, doubtless, have been compiled chiefly from tradition, which is far from being the surest mode of information.\n\nDuring the time of Gregory the Great, when by his policy the Picts were driven from other parts of Scotland, they came to the Orcades as an asylum; but it does not appear, and is far from being probable, that they received a favourable reception, for many of them migrated to Shetland, and from thence to the opposite coasts of Norway. A particular history of these islands during those early ages would afford little entertainment, because its authenticity is at least doubtful. These islands were at various times harassed and plundered by adventurers from Scandinavia; and the Norwegian princes frequently laid the inhabitants under tribute.\n\nWe have said that the Christian religion was transported to the Orkneys from Norway, and that this happened in the beginning of the 11th century. About which time Sigurdis possessed the entire dominion of those isles, and for many years exercised all the powers of a monarch in the north. At the same time Christianity had dawned on Scandinavia, and had become the established religion in the seat of government in Norway. Its doctrines interwove themselves with the policy of the nation; its principles, so nearly interesting to human happiness, made their farther publication an object of much moment to the adventurous princes, and gave a new law to their enterprises. While the power of these principles was acting with original force upon the minds of the people, and their zeal rendered them ambitious of any exploit, whereby they could diffuse their influence; Olaus prince of Norway equipped a squadron destined to carry the knowledge of the gospel to other shores. On this pious adventure he was accompanied not only by numbers of all ranks, whom, as usual, a love of enterprise invited; but by many persons of distinguished knowledge and abilities, men of sincere piety, who had become particularly well acquainted with the Christian doctrines, and entertained a deep sense of their infinite importance. These entered into the fleet, joyful in the prospect of spreading the truths which they revered through yet unenlightened countries; and the squadron soon appeared off the Orcades. Olaus got Sigurdis on board of his fleet, with his son, and but a few attendants, and, as the heir of Harold, he claimed all the provinces over which Sigurdis reigned; and at the same time he ordered him to renounce and abjure the religion of his fathers, and to embrace Christianity. Delay was not permitted; Christianity was forced upon him and his subjects; and, on the departure of Olaus, he carried the son of Sigurdis as an hostage for what he had engaged; which was to give honourable protection to all those holy men who might choose to reside in those parts for the purpose of instructing the people in the nature of the Christian doctrines; for many of the more intelligent and religious men who had come from Norway with Olaus, remained in the Orcades and in the north of Scotland, to fulfil their pious resolution of spreading the light of the gospel there. Olaus, with the rest of his followers, failed on another expedition towards the frith of Moray. The death of Kindius his son, which happened soon after Olaus's return to Norway, released Sigurdis from his engagements with him; and he entered into one with Malcolm II. one of whose daughters he had married, and by whom he had a son, Torphinus. Torphinus's bravery, magnificence, generosity, and hospitality, endeared him to the inhabitants; and he ruled without control for many years, till Ronald, a grandson of Sigurdis, who had lived in Norway, and who was esteemed the rightful heir of the earldom of Orkney, made a successful descent upon it. Torphinus wished to give him battle; and in a sea-fight, with the assistance of some ships from Arminus, a man who had filled some of the first places in Norway, he totally defeated him. By courting the friendship of that court, his dominions remained quiet for the greater part of his life; the latter part of which was no less eminent for establishing salutary laws, and encouraging the arts of industry, than the former had been distinguished for military fame and success in the exploits of war. He lived to an advanced age, until after Malcolm III. had ascended the throne of Scotland. Torphinus had built a sumptuous church in Byrfa, where the first bishops of Orkney resided. In the decline of life he retired to that island, and, finishing his days with exemplary piety, was with much solemnity interred in the temple which he had raised. His country long lamented the loss of so celebrated a ruler, who had established security in it, through the influence of his laws, and had taught it to enjoy the arts and blessings of peace. He left two sons, Paul and Erland, who through the whole of their lives amicably shared both in the honours and administration of their father's extensive domain. During this period, the northern counties are said to have arrived at a very superior degree of cultivation and improvement, which became equally conspicuous in the richness of their lands, and in the mildness of their dispositions. Their sons, however, did not both inherit their father's virtues. Magnus, the son of Erland, was pious and brother, till they were able to return to Lothian, and drive out the Britons. After this they flourished here, and were governed by kings of their own. There still remains a place called Cuminglga, the dwelling place of the minister of Sandwich, whose name and form bespeak it the residence of some of them. But no traces of their history remain, except the name of Belus, in ancient characters, on a stone in the church of Birfa, where still is to be seen one of the principal palaces. This government probably subsisted till the subversion of the Pictish kingdom in Scotland, A.D. 839, by Kenneth II. king of Scotland. On the whole, however, the time of the discovery and population of the Orkneys is certainly unknown. Probably it was very early; for we are told that they owe their name to the Greeks.\n\nOrcades has memorant dictas à nomine Graeco. Claudian.\nORKNEY\n\nand peaceable; a great promoter of religion, and anxious in patronizing the Roman missionaries, and in protecting the establishments of Christianity: but Hacon, the heir of Paul, was vehement, wild, and impatient of restraint. He saw how Magnus was revered, and envy drove him to revenge; for, by the most deliberate and deceitful villany, he got Magnus into his power, and murdered him without mercy. The latter part of his life was spent in penance, and in improving his dominions.\n\nMagnus's singular piety, and the manner of his unfortunate death, were so well represented at the court of Rome, that he was canonized. Hacon left two sons, Paul the Silent, and Harold the Orator. Caithness came to Harold, and the Orkneys were governed by Paul.\n\nRonald, a descendant of St Magnus, an elegant and accomplished youth, appeared at the court of Norway, and was supported in a claim upon the Orkneys, as the heir of the canonized martyr. He sent messengers to Paul, and offered to share the government with him; but this proposal was refused, and the ambassadors were treated with great contempt. They, however, found persons of power disposed to second their master's views; who soon after their return fell out, and vowed, if he succeeded, to build a magnificent church, and to dedicate it to St Magnus. All seemed satisfied with the enterprise; and, full of hope, the fleet set sail. Paul in the mean time put himself in a state of defense. By very artful manoeuvres, however, Ronald obtained his purpose, and willingly shared his sovereignty with Harold, the legal heir of Paul. They lived amicably together; and on the assassination of Ronald, which was accomplished by a proud chieftain, who thought himself insulted, he was buried with great pomp. Harold now fully possessed the unrivalled sovereignty of the north, and lived long to enjoy it. We find that in 1196 he was able to bring 7500 men to the field, and a body of cavalry, against the army of William king of Scotland, but was immediately defeated. In the next year, the Caithnessians rebelled again, headed by one Roderick, and Torphinus, son to Harold. The king met and defeated them near Inverness. Roderick was slain; and William seizing, on Harold in the extremity of Caithness, detained him till Torphinus surrendered himself as a hostage; but on some new treasons of the father, the king, according to the barbarity of the times, caused the eyes of the unhappy youth to be put out; and had him emaculated, of which he soon perished in prison. Harold died in the 73rd year of his age; and with him ended, in its earls, the independent sovereignty of the north of Scotland. The Norwegians seem to have been in possession of these isles as late as 1266; for then Magnus IV. king of Norway, being worsted in war with the Scots, yielded them to Alexander III. king of Scotland by treaty, and Haquin king of Norway confirmed the possession of them to King Robert Bruce in the year 1312. Lastly, in 1464, Christian I. king of Norway and Denmark, when he gave his daughter in marriage to James III. king of Scotland, transferred all his right to them to his son-in-law and his successors; to make which more binding the Pope's confirmation was obtained. We are told by some, that Magnus sold them to Alexander for the sum of 4000 marks sterling, and a yearly acknowledgment of 100 merks.\n\nThey are about 30 in number; but many of them are uninhabited, the greater part being small, and producing only pasture for cattle. The principal islands are denominated by the names of Mainland, South Ronaldshoe, Swinna, Flotta, Copinshe, Strupenshe, Stronshe, Sanda, &c., the terminations in a, or ha, being generally given in the Teutonic to such places as are surrounded by water. The currents and tides flowing between the islands are extremely rapid and dangerous. Near an island called Swinna are two great whirlpools, called the wells of Swinna, which are counted dangerous by mariners, especially in a calm. When sailors find themselves sucked into the vortex, it is said they throw out a barrel, or some bulky substance, which smooths the water till it is sucked down and thrown up at a considerable distance, during which time the ship passes over in safety. But when there is a breeze of wind, these whirlpools may be crossed without any danger. The largest of these islands is called Pomona, in length 33, and in breadth 9 miles, containing 9 parish-churches, and 4 excellent harbours.\n\nThe air of these isles is moist, on account of the neighbourhood of the sea; and frost and snow do not continue long. In some places the soil is bare and mountainous, and in others sandy and barren; however, many of the isles produce large crops of barley and oats, but no wheat or other grain excepting what is inclosed in gardens. These, when duly cultivated, produce all kinds of kitchen herbs and roots, bringing even fruit-trees to maturity; but out of them, in the open country, there is scarce a tree or shrub to be seen, except juniper, wild myrtle, heath, and the cyur-hodou: yet this deficiency cannot be imputed to the poverty of the soil, or the nature of the climate: for the trunks of large oaks are frequently dug up in the marshes. This is likewise the case in the most barren parts of the Highlands of Scotland, where not a shrub is to be seen above the surface of the earth; nay, the inhabitants frequently find, deep in the earth, the roots of large trees, evidently exhibiting marks of the axe by which they were felled; so that these northern parts must have undergone some strange revolutions. The Orkneys produce great variety of herbs and berries, grass and corn, which last is exported as far as Edinburgh. In some of the isles, the natives have discovered mines of tin, lead, and silver, though none of them are wrought to any advantage; in others, we find abundance of marl, gray and red flate, quarries of freestone, and even of marble and alabaster. When the wind rages to any violence, the sea throws in plenty of timber, torn from other countries; and, not infrequently, the people find large pieces of ambergrise. The fresh water in these isles is very pure and limpid; and, though there are no large rivers in the Orkneys, the ground is well watered with lakes and pleasant rivulets, that not only serve to turn their mills, but also abound with trout of the most delicate flavour.\n\nBesides the abundance of little horses, black cattle, sheep, swine, and rabbits, the inhabitants of the Orkneys rear all sorts of domestic animals and tame poultry. Their heaths and commons yield plenty of red\nOrkney deer, and all sorts of game; partridges, grouse, heath-cocks, plover, duck, teal, and widgeon: the sea-coasts teem with seals and otters; and are visited by whales, cod, ling, tusk, herrings, and all manner of fish: on the shore they find spermaceti, os sepiæ, and a great variety of shells and corallines, with a multitude of oysters, remarkably large mussels, crabs, and cockles. The rocks are covered with sea-fowl, wild geese, feral geese, barnacles, eagles, hawks, and kites. With respect to the barnacles, or, as the natives call them, the clock geese, they are said to be found in shells sticking by the bills to trees, in several islands. Martin affirms he has seen them in this situation, but could not perceive them alive; and indeed the whole account of their generation and production, exhibited by the northern naturalists, is absurd and unphilosophical. The Orkney eagles are so strong, that according to the reports of the country, they have been known to carry away young children in their talons. Certain it is, they make such havoc among the lambs, that he who kills an eagle is entitled by law to a hen from every house in the parish where it was killed. The king's falconer visits these islands every year, in order to fetch away the young hawks and falcons from their nests among the precipices: he enjoys a yearly salary of £20, and may claim a hen or a dog from every house in the country, except those that are expressly exempted from this imposition.\n\nThe gentry of the Orkneys are civilized, polite, and hospitable; and live like those of Scotland, from whom they are chiefly descended. They live comfortably, are remarkably courteous to strangers, and drink a great quantity of wine, with which their cellars are generally well stored. Indeed the inhabitants of the Orkneys may be now justly deemed a Scotch colony. They speak the language, profess the religion, follow the fashions, and are subject to the laws, of that people. They are frugal, sagacious, circumspect, religious, and hospitable. Their mariners are remarkably bold, active, dexterous, and hardy. Many surprising instances of longevity occur here, as well as in Shetland, of persons living to the age of 140. The Orkney women are generally handsome, and well shaped, and bring forth children at a very advanced age. In the Orkneys, some particular lands are held by a tenure called Udal Right, from Ulcius, or Olaus, king of Norway, who farmed the lands, on condition of receiving one-third of the produce; and this right devolved in succession, without any charter granted by the sovereign. The inhabitants of Orkney, instead of measuring their corn, weigh it in pimores or pundlers. Their least denomination is a mark, consisting of 18 ounces, and 24 marks make a lispond, which is a Danish quantity. The poorer sort of people in the Orkneys appear very meanly habituated, with a piece of seal-skin, instead of shoes; and living chiefly on salt fish, are subject to the scurvy. They are much addicted to superstitious rites; in particular, interpreting dreams and omens, and believing in the force of idle charms. The islands of Orkney, we have already observed, produce very bold, able, and hardy mariners. The common people, in general, are inured to fatigue, and remarkably adventurous, both in fishing during rough weather, and in climbing the rocks for the flesh, eggs, and down of sea-fowl. Formerly, while they were exposed to the invasions of the Norwegians, or western islanders, every village was obliged to equip a large boat well manned; and all the fishermen appeared in arms, when the alarm was given by the beacons lighted on the tops of the rocks and highest mountains. These beacons, known by the name of ward hills, are still to be seen in every island. Their corn land they inclose with mud or stone walls, to preserve it from the ravages of their sheep, swine, and cattle, which wander about at random, without being attended by herdsmen: their ordinary manure, especially near the sea-coast, is sea-weed, which they carefully gather and divide into equal portions. Their sheep are marked on the ears and nose; but so wild, that when they have occasion to shear them in the month of May, they are obliged to hunt every individual, with dogs trained for that purpose. Their manner of catching sea-fowl is curious and particular. Under the rock where these fowls build they row their boat, provided with a large net, to the upper corners of which are fastened two ropes, lowered down from the top of the mountain by men placed in that station. These hoisting up the net, until it be spread opposite to the cliffs in which the fowls are sitting, the boatmen below make a noise with a rattle, by which the fowls being frightened, fly forwards into the bottom of the net, in which they are immediately enclosed and lowered down into the boat; others practice the method used in Iceland and Norway, and are lowered down by a single rope from the summit of the mountain; this is the constant way of robbing the hawk's nest. See Bird-Catching. In these islands some strange effects are produced by thunder and lightning. In the year 1680, the lightning entered a cowhouse, in which 12 cows stood in a row, and killed every second beast as the flood, and left the rest untouched. The distempers that prevail mostly in the Orkneys are agues, consumptions, scurvy, and itch. The agues, which abound in the spring, the natives cure with a diet drink of bitters and antiscorbutics infused in ale: for phthisical complaints they use the plant arby, and the caryophyllus marinus boiled with sweet milk.\n\nThe isles of Orkney and Shetland compose one stewartry, and send one member to the imperial parliament. The right of superiority to the Orkneys was dismembered from the crown by the union parliament, and granted for a certain yearly consideration to the earl of Morton, by Queen Anne, who appointed him hereditary steward and judicatory. This nobleman possesses the power of creating certain judges, called bailiffs. There is one of these established in every island and parish, with power to superintend the manners of the inhabitants, to hold courts, and determine civil causes, according to the laws of Scotland, to the value of ten pounds Scots money, amounting to 16s. 8d.; but all contests of higher import are referred to the decision of the steward or his deputy, who resides at Kirkwall, which is the seat of justice. Subordinate to the bailiffs are six or seven of the most reputable and intelligent inhabitants, who oversee the conduct of their fellows, acting as constables, and make report of all enormities to the bailiff; who causes the delinquent to be apprehended and punished, if the crime be within the extent of his judicial power; otherwise he transmits him to Kirkwall, where he is tried by the steward. The Protestant\ntenant religion prevails in the isles of Orkney, according to the rites and discipline of the kirk; there, and the isles of Shetland, constituting one presbytery, which assembles at Kirkwall. The country is divided into 18 parishes, containing 31 churches, and above 100 chapels.\n\nThe trade of the Orkneys is not very considerable, though it might be extended to great advantage. They supply with fresh provisions, for ready money, the ships and vessels that touch upon the coast in the course of northern voyages, or in their passage from the East Indies, when they go north about Ireland and Scotland, in time of war, to avoid the privateers of the enemy. They are also visited by those engaged in the herring-fishery, though there is not such a resort on this account to these islands as to the isles of Shetland. Nevertheless a good number of boats from the western parts of Scotland, as well as from Londonderry, Belfast, and other parts of Ireland, fish for herrings as far north as the Leuze, and supply the Orkneys with tobacco, wine, brandy, and other spirituous liquors, cloths, and divers manufactures. These they exchange for fish, and oil extracted from porpoises, seals, and other sea-animals.\n\nThe people of Orkney export annually great numbers of black cattle, swine, and sheep; together with large quantities of corn, butter, tallow, salt, and stuffs made in the country, over and above the skins of seals, otters, lambs, and rabbits, down, feathers, writing-quills, hams, and wool; yet all these articles would, in point of profit, fall infinitely short of their herring-fishery, were it prosecuted with industry, economy, and vigour.\n\nThe most valuable of their manufactures is kelp, and indeed the staple commodity was first introduced in 1722, by Mr James Fen, of Whitehall, in Stromness, since which period it has been gradually on the increase. From 1763 to 1778, there were manufactured, on an average, 1800 tons annually at four guineas per ton; from 1778 to 1792, the annual average produce was 3000 at 6l. per ton; from 1792 to 1794, above 4000 tons. Thus, from 1772 to 1794, a period of 72 years, the produce of the kelp was 291,976l. sterling, or more than the value of all the Orkney islands, even at the rate of 36 years purchase; the annual rent, exclusive of the kelp and fisheries, not exceeding 800l. sterling.\n\nAs there are no merchants in the Orkneys at present who export fish on their own account, what herrings are taken they sell to the Dutch or Scotch dealers in and about Inverness. They generally fish for herring on the west side of the Orkneys; and are therefore more remote from markets than those who are employed in the same manner on the coast of Shetland. In the Orkney islands they see to read at midnight in June and July; and during four of the summer months they have frequent communications, both for business and curiosity, with each other, and with the continent; the rest of the year, however, they are almost inaccessible, through fogs, darkness, and storms. It is a certain fact, that a Scotch fisherman was imprisoned in May for publishing the account of the prince and princess of Orange being raised to the throne of England the preceding November; and he would probably have been hanged, had not the news been confirmed by the arrival of a ship.\n\nWe may reckon among the curiosities of the Orkneys, the Phaëoli, commonly known by the name of Molucca beans, and sometimes they are called Orkney beans. They are a sort of fruit found on the shore of the Orkney islands, being thrown on them by storms of westerly wind. They are of several distinct species, and are none of them the produce of those islands, nor of any places thereabout, but are probably of American origin, many of them being plainly natives of Jamaica, and other islands of the Indies.\n\nThey are found principally on those coasts which are most exposed to the waves of the great ocean, and are on these so plentiful, that they might be gathered in large quantities, if of any value; but the only use they are put to is the making of snuff-boxes out of them. Sir Robert Sibbald, and Mr Wallace, in their accounts of Scotland, have both named them Molucca Beans. Many strange fishes and curious shells are also frequently cast up by the ocean; of these last a vast variety are preferred for adorning the cabinets of modern naturalists. Sometimes exotic fowls are driven upon the Orkneys by tempestuous weather: fish, as large as whitings, have been thrown ashore to a considerable distance within the land. At Cantick-head, in the island Waez, and some other places, huge stones are often heaved up by the violence of the sea and wind, and cast over high rocks upon the land. A single Laplander has been seen more than once upon this coast, in his slender canoe, covered with skins, being driven hither by adverse winds and storms. The Orkneys are not altogether destitute of ancient monuments and curiosities of art. In Hoy we find an entire stone, 36 feet long, 18 in breadth, and 9 in thickness, lying between two hills, and known by the name of dwarfish stone. It is hollowed within by the tools of a mason, the marks of which are still apparent. The entrance is a square hole about two feet high, with a stone, by way of door, standing before it. Within we find a bed with a pillow cut out of the stone; at the other end is a couch of the same kind; and in the middle a hearth, above which there is a hole or vent for the exit of the smoke. This curiosity is found in the midst of a desolate heath, and is supposed to have been the residence of a hermit: in the very neighbourhood of this stone there is a very high and steep mountain, called the sword-hill of Hoy, near the summit of which, in the months of May, June, and July, something at noon-day is seen to shine and sparkle with remarkable lustre, supposed by the common people to be an enchanted carbuncle; many persons have clambered up the hill in quest of it, but found nothing. Perhaps this splendour is produced by the reflection of the sun on a small stream of water sliding over the face of a smooth rock. At Stennis, in Mainland, there is a causeway of stones over a loch or lake, at the south end of which we observe a circle of stones rising about 20 feet above ground, each being six feet in breadth, and from one or two feet in thickness: between this circle and the causeway two stones of the same dimensions stand by themselves, and one of them is perforated in the middle. At the distance of half a mile from the other end of the causeway appears a larger circle of the same kind of stones, the diameter of which may amount to 110 paces; some of these stones are fallen; and to the east and west of the larger circle are two artificial green mounts. Both rounds are surrounded with a ditch; and one cannot view them without admiration, considering\nconsidering the art that must have been used to bring such unwieldy masses together in this order. They were probably temples and places of sacrifice used in times of pagan superstition; and seem to bear a great affinity with the celebrated monument called Stonehenge, on Salisbury Plain in England. In one of the mounts, at the north end of the causeway, the natives found nine fibulae, or clasps of silver, formed into a circle, and resembling a horse shoe. In many different places of the Orkneys we find rude obelisks or finger stones of a great height, set up either as memorials of battles, treaties, or the decease of remarkable personages. In Roufay, between two high mountains, there is a place which the natives distinguish by the appellation of the camp of Jupiter Fring: but the meaning of this name, handed down by tradition, is not known. At the west end of the Mainland, near Skeal, we find a surprising causeway, above a quarter of a mile in length, on the summit of high hills, composed of reddish stones of different magnitudes impressed with various figures both on the upper and under surface. Some gentlemen in the neighbourhood have carried off the most beautiful of these stones, to be set in their chimneys by way of ornament, like the painted tiles of Holland. This country produces many sepulchres of different nations. In the plains or links of Skeal, the sand being blown away from the surface of the ground, several square catacombs appear built of stones well cemented together, containing some parcels of black earth, and each secured by a large stone at the mouth. Sepulchres of the same kind are found at Roufum in Stronsa; which is likewise remarkable for a different kind of monument, consisting of one entire stone cylinder hollowed, with a bottom like that of a barrel, and a round stone to fill up the entrance; above, the stone was sharpened into an edge; within were found some burned bones and red clay; and over it was placed a large flat stone for the preservation of the whole. These, in all probability, were Roman catacombs. In Westra divers Danish graves have been discovered: in one of these appeared the skeleton of a man, with a sword on one side and a Danish axe on the other. Some have been found buried with dogs, combs, knives, and other utensils. In many places of the country we find round hillocks or barrows, here known by the name of broghs, signifying, in the Teutonic language, burying place, supposed to have been the cemeteries of the ancient Saxons. In different parts of these islands we see the remains of great buildings, believed to have been fortresses erected by the Danes or Norwegians when they possessed the country. One of these in the isle of Wyre, called the castle of Coppi-row, signifying a town of security, is surrounded by a fosse, and the first floor still remains above ground, a perfect square of stone wall, very thick, strongly built, and cemented with lime, the area within not exceeding ten feet in length. Of this Coppi-row the common people relate many idle fables. In the chapel of Clet, in the isle of Sanda, there is a grave 19 feet long, in which was found part of a man's back bone, larger than that of a horse. Human bones, of nearly the same size, have been dug up in Weftra; and indeed this country is remarkable for producing men of a gigantic stature. Within the ancient fabric of Lady Kirk in South Ronaldshaw, there is a stone four feet long and two feet broad, on which the prints of two feet are engraven, supposed to be the place where, in times of popery, penitents stood to do public penance. The cathedral of Kirkwall, the capital of the Orkneys, is a fine Gothic building, dedicated to St Magnus, but now converted into a parish church. Its roof is supported by 14 pillars on each side; and its steeple, in which is a good ring of bells, by four large pillars. The three gates of the church are chequered with red and white polished stones, embossed and elegantly flowered.\n\nCampbell, in his Political Survey, suggests two improvements in the Orkneys: 1.

Allowing the East India Company to erect a spacious magazine in one of these islands; where also a collector, and a sufficient number of king's officers, should reside, to receive the duties of such East India commodities as might be taken off by British subjects.

When it is at the top or bottom of a shaft, it is called cincture. Palladio uses the word orlo for the plenith of the basis of the columns.\n\nORLE, in Heraldry. See Heraldry.\n\nORLEANOIS, a province of France, now forming the department of Loiret, and including the several districts of Orleanois-Propre, Beauce-Propre or Chartrain, Dunois, Vendemois, Blaifois, the greatest part of Gatinois, and Perche-Gonnet. The principal rivers of it are the Loire, the Loiret, the Cher, the Laconic, the Aigle, the Eyere, the Yonne, and the Eyre. There are also some remarkable canals, particularly those of Briare and Orleans. The river Loire, and the canals drawn from thence, greatly facilitate and promote the inland trade of the kingdom, and particularly of this department.\n\nOrleanois, in Latin Aurelianensis Ager, is bounded on the south by Sologne, on the north by Upper-Beauce, on the east by Gatinois, and on the west by Dunois and Vendemois. The Loire divides it into Upper and Lower; the former lying to the north, and the latter to the south of that river. It yields plenty of grain, wine, wood, and fruit, and abounds in cattle, game, and fish.\n\nORLEANS, the capital of the government of Orleanois, now the department of Loiret. It was anciently called Genabum, or Cenabum; and afterwards denominated Aurelia, Aurelie, and Aureliana, by the emperor Aurelian, who considerably enlarged it. In Julius Caesar's time it was the capital of the Carnutes. It stands about 20 leagues south of Paris, on the northern bank of the Loire; across which Mr Wraxall says there is an elegant bridge of nine arches, the entrance by which is exceedingly noble and striking; the street which leads from it being composed of most elegant modern buildings. In general, however, excepting this street, it is very meanly built; the streets are narrow, and the inhabitants in general poor. It is surrounded with walls, and fortified with 40 towers. The streets almost all terminate at the quay for the convenience of trade. It is a place of considerable magnitude; and before the revolution had several inferior courts of justice, and an university of no great repute. It was also a bishop's see; and the cathedral is a most superb Gothic structure, and had the finest steeple in France till it was damaged in the time of the civil wars. There were 22 parishes in it, and a great number of churches, some of which were collegiate, and religious houses. There is also a public walk, planted with several rows of trees; and there used to be some sugar bakers; a manufacture of stockings and sheep skins; a seminary in which divinity was taught; a great trade in brandy, wine, spices, and several manufactures, which, with many other commodities, used to be conveyed to Paris by means of the Loire, and the canal which takes its name from the city. The canal begins about two miles above the city; is near 18 leagues in length; and terminates on the Loing, which falls into the Seine.\n\nThe environs of Orleans, more especially in the province of Sologne, to the south of the Loire, are very agreeable. It is in general a level country, covered with corn and vines. To the north of the city is a forest, the largest in the whole kingdom. Before the revolution it belonged to the Duke of Orleans, to whom the timber felled in it, one year with another, brought about 100,000 livres. Ever since the year 1344 this city has been a dukedom and peerage, and usually an appendage of some prince of the blood. The late duke, who took the name of Egélie, and who was afterwards guillotined, seems to have been one of the most detestable monsters which ever disgraced humanity. Louis XIV. gave the dukedom to his own brother Philip, who began and finished the canal; which, by the duties paid by vessels going up and down, brought in, one year with another, 100,000 livres. The bishop was suffragan to the archbishop of Paris, and had a revenue of 24,000 livres, out of which his tax to Rome was 2000 florins. A new bishop, it is said, on the first day of his entering, had the privilege of releasing all the prisoners in it, except those committed for treason. In the street leading from the bridge stands the celebrated monument where Charles VII. and Joan of Arc the Maid of Orleans, are represented on their knees before the body of our Saviour, who lies extended on the lap of the Virgin. It was erected by order of that monarch in 1458, to perpetuate his victories over the English, and their expulsion from his dominions. All the figures are in iron. The king appears bareheaded, and by him lies his helmet surmounted with a crown. Opposite to him is the Maid herself, in the same attitude of grateful devotion to Heaven. It is a most precious and invaluable historical monument.\n\n\"In the Hotel de Ville (says Wraxall) is a portrait of the same immortal woman, which I studied long and attentively. Though it was not done till 1581, which was near 130 years after her decease, it is yet the oldest and best picture of her now existing. The painter seems undoubtedly to have drawn a flattering resemblance of her, and to have given his heroine imaginary charms. Her face, though long, is of exceeding beauty, heightened by an expression of intelligence and grandeur rarely united. Her hair falls loosely down her back, and she wears on her head a sort of bonnet enriched with pearls, and shaded with white plumes, tied under her chin with a string. About her neck is a little collar, and lower down, upon her bosom, a necklace composed of small links. Her dress, which is that of a woman, I find it difficult exactly to describe. It fits close to the body, and is cut or slashed at the arms and elbows. Round her waist is an embroidered girdle, and in her right hand she holds the sword with which she expelled the enemies of her sovereign and her country. I am not surprised at the animated and enthusiastic attachment which the French still cherish for her memory. The critical and desperate emergency in which she appeared; her sex, youth, and even the obscurity of her birth; the unparalleled success which crowned her enterprise; the cruel and detestable sentence by which she was put to death; the air of the marvellous spread over the whole narration, increased and strengthened by that veneration which time affixes to every great event—all these united causes confirmed\nto place her above mortality. Rome and Athens would undoubtedly have ranked her among their tutelary deities, and have erected temples to her honour; nor can I help being amazed, that amidst the almost infinite number of modern saints who crowd and disgrace their churches, no altar has yet been dedicated to the Maid of Orleans.\" See France, No 101.\n\nThe bridge was new built in the 18th century, and opened in 1760; and the French esteem it the finest in the world.

He taught belles lettres for some time in his society, but afterwards devoted himself to the writing of history. This pursuit he continued till his death, which happened in 1693. He wrote also a history of the Revolutions of Spain; A History of Two conquering Tartars, Chunchi and Cambi; The Life of Father Coton, &c. His History of the Revolutions in England, under the family of the Stuarts, from the year 1663 to 1690, was translated into English, and published at London, 1711, in one vol. 8vo: to which is prefixed an Introduction, by Laurence Echard, M. A., who says, that \"the great varieties and wonderful changes in these reigns are here judiciously comprised in a moderate volume with no less perspicuity than strictness; and with a beautiful mixture of short characters, nice reflections, and noble sentences, which render the whole agreeable and instructive. But while the reader is entertained with so much skill and fineness, we ought to caution him with relation to the education and religion of the author; for though he has great marks of a generous candour, and a laudable deference to all superiors; yet he is to be considered, in all places, as one in favour with the French king, and not only a true papist, but a complete Jesuit.\"\n\nORLOPE, in the sea language, the uppermost space or deck in a great ship, reaching from the main to the mizen mast.

For a long time it gave the title of earl, and afterwards of marquis and duke, to the noble family of Butler, descended from a sister of Thomas à Becket archbishop of Canterbury; till, at the accession of George I. the last duke was attainted of high treason, and died abroad.

By the late inland navigation, it has communication with the rivers Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Darwent, Severn, Crake, Humble, Thames, Avon, &c. which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles, in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Stafford, Warwick, Leicestershire, Oxford, Worcestershire, &c. There is a bituminous earth about this place, from which oil of amber is extracted, that preserves raw flesh, and serves the poor people instead of candles.\n\nThere is nothing remarkable at Ormskirk, but the monuments of some of the ancient family of the Stanleys before they were ennobled. Not far from it is Latham House, to which belongs a large estate, and a fine park. It is remarkable only because it was gallantly defended in the civil wars by Lady Charlotte countess of Derby, who held it to the last extremity against the parliament forces, who could never oblige her to capitulate. She held out gloriously till she was relieved by Prince Rupert. It was, however, ruined in a second siege, and sold by the family to Sir Thomas Bootle, who built a very magnificent house upon it.\n\nORMUS, a small island of Asia, at the bottom of the gulf of the same name, at the entrance of the gulf of Persia. It is about two leagues from the main land, and about six leagues in circuit. They catch excellent oysters about the island; and it yields plenty of fine white salt; also a kind of shining black sand, which is used for dusting writings, and is transported in considerable quantity to Europe. There is neither sweet water nor grass upon it, the soil being of a salt sulphurous nature. It was taken by the Portuguese in 1507, who fortified it; and it was afterwards frequented by a vast number of merchants, who were extremely rich. In 1622 the Persians, by the assistance of the English, conquered this place, and demolished the houses, which were 4000 in number, containing 40,000 inhabitants. Some time after, the Persians rebuilt the fort, and placed a garrison in it; but they could never bring it to be a place of trade as before: however, it is the key of the Persian gulf, as well on account of the importance of the place, as the commodiousness of the harbour. It is now almost deserted, for it produces nothing but salt, which sometimes is two inches deep upon the surface of the earth. E. Long. 56. 25. N.

See Botany Index.\n\nORNITHOLOGY.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe term Ornithology is derived from the Greek ὄρνις, a bird, and λόγος, discourse, and denotes that part of Zoology which treats of birds.\n\nBirds are two-footed animals, covered with feathers, and furnished with wings. Like quadrupeds and the cetaceous tribe, they have warm blood, a heart with two ventricles and two auricles, and lungs for the purpose of respiration; but they are distinguished from both by their feet, feathers, wings, and horny bill, as well as by the circumstance of their females being oviparous.\n\nThe elegant and beautiful colouring of many of the feathered race, the graceful ease of their flight, their various music, their tender solicitude for their offspring, their engaging instincts, their susceptibility of domestication, and their subservience to the fulness of man, have, in all ages, contributed to interest the latter in the study of their history.\n\nOf the naturalists, however, whose writings have descended to us from antiquity, Aristotle and Pliny are the only two who appear to have entered into any details on a subject so inviting and important. Though the former composed no particular treatise on birds, he brings them under review in different parts of his History of Animals. In the third chapter of the eighth book, for example, he enumerates the different sorts of nourishment adapted to different species, and their various modes of feeding. The ninth book contains his very imperfect nomenclature, his remarks on the diversified modes of nidification, and some valuable observations on the family of eagles. His notion of the organization and habits of birds are interspersed in the body of the work, and introduced in the way of comparative reference to the structure and manners of other animals. Pliny's enumeration of the feathered species, is extended over most part of his tenth book, but is defective of precise description, and encumbered with absurdity and fable.\n\nOf the numerous ornithologists of more modern date, some have chiefly directed their labours to method and classification, others have been more solicitous to describe and delineate; some have treated of the whole class, others of particular portions of it; while, lastly, some have been contented to define and describe, and others have illustrated and enhanced their text by more or less accurate designs from living or prepared specimens. This combination of the pen and the pencil, which has so eminently contributed, in our day, to the acquisition and diffusion of knowledge, seems to have been unknown to the ancients.\n\nAlthough the unavoidable limitation of our plan precludes a minute and critical report of the works to which we have just alluded, we shall briefly advert to a few of the most conspicuous. Among the first who excited, on the continent, a taste for the study of ornithology, and for a methodical distribution of that portion of science, we may mention Belon. Aware that nature Belon is most successfully contemplated in her own works, he travelled from the laudable desire of collecting information, and communicated to the world the results of his enquiries. His History of Birds, a thin folio volume, divided into seven books, or parts, and illustrated by wooden cuts, was published at Paris, in 1555. His principle of classification being chiefly founded on the circumstances of habitation and food, and only occasionally on external forms and characters, is obviously very defective; his descriptions, though tolerably accurate, are, for the most part too concise; and many of his plates are very inadequate representations of their originals. It must, at the same time, be allowed, that he frequently suggests judicious views of his subject; that he notes with ingenuity, the points of resemblance between the human skeleton and that of birds; that he has penned several passages which may still be perused with interest and instruction; that the naïveté of his manner is always pleasing, and that when we reflect on the period in which he flourished, he is entitled to no ordinary praise.\n\nThe celebrated Conrad Gesner, physician and professor at Zurich, and contemporary with Belon, has devoted the third volume of his History of Animals to the department of ornithology. It is an erudite, but ponderous tome, exhibiting alphabetical tables of the names of birds, in Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, Greek, Latin, and most of the spoken languages of Europe. His descriptions are compiled abridgements; but his references, at the close of each article, are very numerous; for if any author of his acquaintance happen to mention a bird, his name and the passage are duly commemorated. Gesner's arrangement differs in no respect from that of any common dictionary; and few of his engravings are executed with correctness. The curious reader will probably be gratified with the perusal of his account of the art of rearing birds for falconry, the diseases to which they are liable, and the remedies which the learned doctor prescribes.\n\nThe same topics are discussed by Aldrovandus, a physician of Bologna, who availing himself of the writings of the two preceding naturalists, added to their indebted stores, and compiled three folios, divided into 20 books, and illustrated by wooden plates. His catalogue, however, scarcely comprises any birds but such as are natives of Europe, and by no means all even of these. He too implicitly adopts the vague distinctions of Belon; and on various occasions, not only copies Aristotle with fervency, but overlays his borrowed materials with a mass of dark commentary. The motley complexion of the whole production, in fact, betrays the desire of accumulation rather than the exercise of taste and judgment.\n\nJohnston, who published in 1657 a folio volume of 160 pages, did little else than greatly condemn the heavy compliments of Gesner and Aldrovandus. He divides the whole class into land and water birds, and deduces his subordinate divisions from the nature of their aliments.\nHis descriptions are generally correct, but scanty; and even his figures, though traced with more character than those of his predecessors, bespeak a parsimony of engraving.\n\nThe next writer of eminence in this department, who merits particular quotation, is Francis Willoughby, Esq., an English gentleman, who laid the foundation of a more accurate arrangement. His work, which appeared in 1676, was revised and edited by his friend the celebrated Ray. It is divided into three books, of which the first is allotted to general views of the subject, and an explanation of the author's method. The first chapter treats of the form and external structure of birds, the second of their organization and internal structure. The third includes 24 queries, the answers to which, if founded on fact, would greatly contribute to the advancement of ornithology. Mr Willoughby formally recognizes the grand division of terrestrial and aquatic, comprising under the former those which live at a distance from water, and under the second, those which live on the margin or surface of that element. He then institutes his leading distinctions from the form of the bill and feet, and would doubtless have accomplished a more complete arrangement, had he uniformly adhered to the same principle; but in compliance with the prejudices of his time, he assumes the different kinds of food, the varieties of size, the nature of the flesh, and even moral qualities, as the grounds of subdivisions. At all events, however, he has the credit of having opened a career, which others have successfully pursued. His second and third books contain the description and history of the species, distributed according to the rules laid down in the first. To the exposition of each genus are prefixed two chapters of general observations; the first including the vague or fabulous accounts of the ancients, and the second such common properties as appertain to the genus. The author then proceeds to the specific details, stating the most important particulars with precision and neatness, and concluding with an account of peculiar habits.\n\nRay, in his Synopsis Avium, follows, with a few exceptions, the method of his friend, referring at the same time to the tail feathers, and some parts of the internal conformation. The latter, we need scarcely remark, cannot with any propriety be adopted as generic or specific characters.\n\nThe new method of classing birds proposed by Monsieur Barrere in 1745, implies either a total ignorance or blamable neglect of the writings of Willoughby and Ray. As its only tendency was to confuse and perplex, we forbear noticing its details. Suffice it to remark, that it includes the peacock and man-of-war bird in the same family, and ranks the yellow-hammer between the bustard and the ostrich. In his Essay on the Natural History of Guiana, the same author enumerates the birds in alphabetical order; but his catalogue has been more than doubled by subsequent travellers.\n\nJacob Theodore Klein, member of several learned academies, published at Lubeck in 1750 a quarto volume, entitled, Historiae Avium Prodromus, cum praefatione de ordine animalium in genere. In this work he divides birds into families, orders, and tribes. His eight families are distinguished by the conformation of the feet, his orders by the form of the bill, and his tribes, sometimes by the form and proportions of the head, sometimes by accidental differences of the bill, and sometimes by the author's own fanciful ideas. From too great an anxiety to simplify, this naturalist is generally too brief, and adds to his obscurity by an affectation of learned phraseology.\n\nThis last mentioned quality likewise disfigures the scientific catalogue of Meehring, physician to the prince of Anhalt, which appeared in 1752. His classes, orders, and genera, are founded on the formation of the feet and bill; and his descriptions of birds examined by himself, are usually accurate; but he is often misled by the errors of others, and the method which he proposes is complex and incommodious.\n\nIn this summary of celebrated systematic ornithologists, we may assign to Linnaeus the date of 1766, when he published the 12th edition of his Systema Naturae. In so far as that astonishing body of arrangement respects the feathered tribes, it certainly manifests at once the extent and minuteness of the author's discriminating powers. As the same nomenclature and divisions are still the most familiar to British naturalists, we purpose to be chiefly regulated by them in the sequel, and consequently shall, for the present, waive any explanation of the Linnean arrangement.\n\nM. Salente physician at Orleans, left behind him a sublime MS. treatise on Ornithology, which was published by his friends in 1767. His method is that of Ray. The historical part is from the pen of Salente himself; but the body of the text is a promiscuous and clumsy compilation. The typography is executed with neatness and elegance, and the plates, which are 31 in number, are engraved with uncommon skill; though the larger birds are for the most part represented on too small a scale.\n\nM. Briffon of the Royal Academy of Sciences, published, in 1760, A System of Ornithology, in Latin and French, in six quarto volumes. He distributes birds into 26 orders, instituted from the form of the feet, bill, &c. 115 genera, which are determined by the peculiarities of the bill or mandibles, and about 1300 species. Each article is preceded by a numerous and accurate list of references and figures; many species, till then undefended, are particularized; and the work is illustrated by upwards of 220 excellent engravings. The principal merit of Briffon's plan consists in the adoption of external and permanent characters, which enable the student to affix the name and station of a bird which he sees for the first time. The descriptions are equally accurate with those of Willoughby, and more copious. Though not exempt from errors and defects, this work still holds a respectable rank in the library of the ornithologist.\n\nThe Natural History of Birds, by the Comte de Buffon, and his learned associates, is too generally known to require our analysis or criticism. Its great defect is want of scientific arrangement, a want which is scarcely redeemed even by the popular, luminous, and elegant style of the descriptions, combined with the highly finished execution of the coloured plates. With the exception, however, to which we have just alluded, we feel no hesitation in adopting the language of the English translator. \"The history of birds possesses every quality that could recommend it to the public; it exhibits a clear and comprehensive view of the knowledge acquired in ornithology, scattered through a multiplicity of volumes, and\nin various languages, it diffuses and elucidates with critical accuracy, the numerous controverted points; it reduces the whole to simplicity, order, and elegance; and, by large additions of valuable matter, it greatly extends the bounds of the science.\"—M. de Buffon was not to be deterred by the difficulty and extent of the undertaking. The correspondents of the king's cabinet continued to transmit numerous communications, and specimens from all parts of the world. Above eighty artists were, under the direction of the younger M. Daubenton, employed five years in the drawing, engraving, and colouring, of upwards of a thousand birds. But the commencement of the work which these were intended to illustrate was delayed two years, by reason of a severe and tedious indisposition, which during that space afflicted the excellent naturalist. And after he had recovered his health, he reflected that at his advanced period of life he could not reasonably expect to be able to accomplish the history of birds, and also that of minerals, in which he had already made some advances. He judged it expedient therefore to have recourse to the affiance of his friends; and he was peculiarly fortunate in the choice of the learned and eloquent M. Gueneau de Montbeillard, who cheerfully undertook the laborious task, and composed the greatest part of the two first volumes of the History of Birds, which appeared in 1771, under the name however of M. de Buffon. In his complex of thought and mode of expression, M. de Montbeillard followed so closely his illustrious associate, that the public could not perceive any change. It was now proper to throw off the mask; and in the publication of the four subsequent volumes, each author prefixed his name to his own articles. The third volume was nearly printed when new affiance was received from the communications of James Bruce, Esq. of Kinmaird. That accomplished and adventurous traveller, in his return from Abyssinia, passed some days with M. de Buffon at Paris. The count was filled with admiration on seeing the numerous and elegant drawings which Mr Bruce had made of natural objects; and on several occasions he mentions the explorer of the source of the Nile in terms the most flattering and respectful. After the publication of the fifth volume in 1781, M. de Montbeillard was desirous of devoting the whole of his leisure in composing the History of Insects, which had become his favourite study. The three remaining volumes were therefore written by M. de Buffon himself; though he acknowledges that the Abbé Bexon had collected the nomenclature, formed most of the descriptions, and communicated several important hints. The work was completed in 1783; and as only a few copies of the illuminated plates were on sale, and these extremely costly, a small set of engravings were made, to accommodate ordinary purchasers.\"\n\nSoumini's recent edition of Buffon's Natural History contains many valuable additions; and forms, perhaps, one of the most complete works of the kind that has yet appeared. In the department of ornithology, it presents us with descriptions and figures of every bird to which the editors could have access, either in the living or preserved state, or of which they could be favoured with drawings.\n\nMauduyt's Dictionary of Ornithology, which makes part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique, deserves to be particularly quoted, on account of the preliminary discourse, the accuracy of the descriptions and references, and the correct execution of the plates. The whole forms an excellent collection of the most important particulars which lay within the author's reach; and we have occasionally availed ourselves of his labours in the compilation of the present article.\n\nA series of splendid plates was executed at Florence, Gerini, in illustration of Gerini's Ornithology; but they betray, in general, a disregard of nature, and are, in many instances, merely copied from imperfect drawings or inaccurate engravings. Gerini's nomenclature is, likewise, very faulty, and too frequently confounds species and varieties.\n\nIn 1773, the ingenious and indefatigable Mr Pennant published a small volume, entitled, Genera of Birds. In his preface, he enters into a minute account of the external parts of birds, their feathers, flight, nidification, &c. In his selection of systematic arrangement, he gives the preference to that of Ray, whose plan appears to him to be so judicious, that it is scarcely possible to make any change in it for the better. At the same time, he admits, that later discoveries had made a few improvements on his labours. \"My candid friend, Linnaeus,\" adds Mr Pennant, \"will not take it amiss, that I in part, neglect his example; for I permit the land-fowl to follow one another, undivided by the water-fowl with pinnated feet, placing them between the waders or cloven-footed water-fowl, and the web-footed. The ostrich, and land-birds with wings useless for flight, I place as a distinct order. The trumpet (Pipioptera Linnaei) and the lyfordes, I place at the end of the gallinaceous tribe. All are land-birds. The first multiparous, like the generality of the gallinaceous tribe; the last granivorous, swift runners, avoiders of wet places; and both have bills somewhat arched. It must be confessed, that both have legs naked above the knees, and the last, like the waders, lay but few eggs. They seem ambiguous birds, that have affinity with each order; and it is hoped, that each naturalist may be indulged the toleration of placing them as suits his own opinion.\" Mr Pennant's grand divisions, then, are into land-birds, and water-fowl. The first he distributes into the six following orders. 1. Rapacious, 2. Piers, 3. Gallinaceous, 4. Columbine, 5. Pafserine, and 6. Struthious. The second comprehends, 7. Cloven-footed, or Waders, 8. those with Pinnated feet, and 9. the Web-footed.\n\nIn 1781, Dr Latham commenced his General Synopsis of Birds, a work of much accurate detail, and extending to three double quarto volumes, with two of supplement. Admitting the primary division of Ray, he adheres, with a few exceptions, to the Linnaean genera, which as well as the species, his opportunities of research enabled him to multiply to a very considerable amount. Each genus is illustrated by one coloured copperplate at least, usually of some rare species. Of these plates, however, the execution is sometimes coarse or meagre; and candour will not permit us to compliment the author on the purity or correctness of his style. His volumes, nevertheless, constitute a precious repository of descriptions and facts, and must always hold a distinguished place in the library of the ornithologist. Dr Latham is likewise the author of an Index Ornithologicus, which forms a convenient compend of his larger work, being comprised in two quarto volumes.\nAbout two years ago, Sébastien Gérardin de Mirécourt published an \"Elementary View of Ornithology, or the Natural History of those Birds which usually occur in France,\" &c. This gentleman appears to have been born and bred in the department of the Vôges, in which he discharged the duties of professor of natural history, and which is known to contain a greater diversity of the feathered race than almost any province in Europe. His preliminary discourse explains the general topics of ornithology in language at once succinct and perspicuous. The five chapters of which it consists were submitted to the revision of the estimable Daudin, whose premature death his friends and science will long deplore. The arrangement of the work, which is limited to two octavo volumes, and a thin quarto volume of plates, has been chiefly regulated by that of Cuvier, in his Sketch of the Natural History of Animals; but M. Gérardin has ventured to introduce a few occasional alterations, which were suggested in the course of his teaching in the central school, and which he conceived would facilitate the progress of his pupils. His synonymy is that of Linnæus and Brillon; and his descriptions are generally minute, distinct, and accurate. On the whole, however, the reader is entitled to expect more copious information relative to the manners and habits of many of the species, than will be found in these results of thirty years application to the subject, combined with many favourable opportunities. We have also remarked a want of uniformity and precision in some of the author's statements. The engravings are chiefly valuable on account of the correctness of their outlines.\n\nOf the numerous writers who have treated of the birds of particular countries, we may observe, that Hernandez, a Spanish physician, has described those of Mexico. His work consists of 229 chapters, each of which, generally, treats of a single species. As they are, however, designed only by their Mexican names, and described with too much brevity, their precise stations in the Linnæan arrangement are with difficulty ascertained. Similar objections apply to the work of Nierenberg, who has described the birds of the same country. From both we may infer, that the feathered tribes in Mexico are numerous, and diversified with the most brilliant colouring; and that the natives had made considerable progress in the study of their history.\n\nBrazil presents a still more rich and splendid field to the researches of the ornithologist; but Marcgrave, who professes to delineate its natural history, and allots his fifth book to the birds, is not less defective than the two writers whom we have just mentioned. His plates are not only wretchedly executed; but frequently do not correspond with the descriptions.\n\nSir Hans Sloane, in his History of Jamaica, has represented 44 species of birds, in 18 plates, annexed to the second volume; but it is seldom that the reader can rely on the accuracy of his delineations.\n\nTo Mr Catesby of the Royal Society, we are indebted for an excellent account of the birds of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama islands, in two volumes imperial folio, in French and English. The first volume, and part of the appendix in the second, are devoted to the birds. The descriptions are concise and perspicuous, and accompanied with some interesting notices relative to the manners and habits of the species described. The plates, which are numerous, are generally faithful representations of the originals, and admirably well coloured. The introduction followed in these splendid volumes, approaches somewhat to that of Willoughby.\n\nSchwenckfeld, a physician, who published in 1603, a natural history of Siberia, in two quarto volumes, includes the birds in his fourth book. His enumeration and description of the parts which belong to birds in common with other animals, and of the appropriate parts of the organization of the former, are neat and accurate. His differences, founded on habitation, food, &c., are less valuable. The introduction is followed by the enumeration of birds, in alphabetical order, according to their Latin names. The descriptions, though accurate, are, for the most part, too short; and though adequate to recall a bird already known, are not sufficient to convey a precise notion of those which are described for the first time. The historical portion is too much condensed; and with facts which are calculated to excite interest, the author often blends such as are superfluous, or improbable.\n\nM. Brunnich published in 1764, an account of the Brunnich birds of Denmark, and the neighbouring islands and provinces. In most instances he follows the Linnæan nomenclature, and sometimes the synonymy of Brillon. He chiefly dwells on the rare and non-descript species, but even then seldom enters sufficiently into detail, to enable the student to ascertain the species in question.\n\nM. Sonnerat, corresponding member of the Royal Sonnerat Academy of Sciences of Paris, published, in 1776, an account of his voyage to New Guinea, the Molucca and Philippine islands, the Isle of France, and some other islands, in the Indian ocean; and in 1783, he favoured the world with a relation of his second voyage, to several parts of the East Indies and China. Though this zealous and learned naturalist was prevented by want of time, from forming very extensive collections, his descriptions and designs manifest both accuracy and taste. Besides correcting the errors of former travellers and voyagers, he has noticed a considerable number of birds for the first time, and most of them remarkable either for their singularity or beauty. His account of the wild cock and hen, the origin of our common domestic fowl, will be perused with peculiar interest.\n\nThe splendid work of Frisch, a German naturalist, Frisch, chiefly consists of coloured plates of the birds of Europe, arranged in 12 classes according to distinctions which are sometimes vague and inconvenient. The figures are, for the most part, accurate and lively representations from nature, though, in some instances they are larger than the life. The author has bestowed particular attention on the different colourings of the two sexes of the same species.\n\nM. le Vaillant, author of a voyage to the Cape of Good Hope, and of the natural history of the birds of Africa, is eminently distinguished by the ardour and acuteness with which he has prosecuted his ornithological researches, and has availed himself with laudable diligence of his rare opportunities of collecting accurate details relative to every species which he undertakes to illustrate. His natural history of the birds of paradise, rollers, promeropes, toucans, and barbets, is perhaps the most highly finished and sumptuous publication that has appeared in any of the departments of ornithology. The figures, about one hundred in number, are engraved by Péreé, from the drawings of Barraband, coloured by Langlois.\nLanglois, and retouched by the pencil of the original designer; while the elder Didot has executed the typography, in his best style, on vellum paper. Each figure is as large as life, and is usually drawn from a specimen in the highest state of preservation; and in many cases, an exact representation of the female bird has also been obtained. Though the pre-eminent merit of the work consists in the figures and descriptions, it is in a few instances agreeably diversified by traits of character, which the author remarked in the living bird, and by some interesting hints of a more general complexion, which his accurate and extensive observation enabled him to collect. We cannot, however, refrain from expressing a wish, that he had been more liberal of his synonyms and references, and that he had treated systematic writers with a little more respect. We should not forget, that methodical nomenclature, though the result of art, and liable to many errors, is entitled at least to subordinate regard, and as an unpleasing aid to the memory. Even if we should concede to our innovating author the propriety of those more fanciful arrangements to which he manifests a predilection, it would still admit of doubt, whether, on the whole, they would more accord with gradations unequivocally indicated by nature. Are we certain that, amid her countless productions, nature recognizes a single line of demarcation? or, that the study of ornithology would be essentially promoted by clasping the fillet with the jays, or every individual furnished with parade feathers among birds of paradise?\n\nThe natural history of tanagers, todies, and manakins, by Anfeline Gaëtan Desmaretz, with coloured engravings, from drawings by Paulina de Courcelles, pupil of Barraband, is another of those recent and splendid productions of the Parisian press, which reflect so much honour on the zeal, industry, and taste of the French naturalists. The paper, type, and figures, all bespeak the excellence of the respective artists who have produced them, as well as the love of chaste and elegant embellishment which has presided over the undertaking. The ornamental style of the work, however, is not its sole passport to our favourable notice. The exposition of the three genera mentioned in the title, is a subject which calls for much critical research and laborious investigation. M. Desmaretz, without presuming to entitle the whole nomenclature, lays down many important distinctions, and proceeds with circumspection, so far as his opportunities have enabled him to advance.\n\n\"Before we enter,\" says he, \"on the details of the species, it may be proper to mention, that we shall limit our descriptions to those which we have seen, and of which we have been enabled to exhibit figures. We shall, moreover, endeavour to analyze, and if possible, to unravel the references of authors. Should success thus far attend us, we conceive that we shall have duly performed the part of zealous naturalists.\" Besides descriptions and plates of the male, the author has also, not unfrequently, represented the female, or young of the same species, or an individual as it appears in the moulting state. His pages will afford least entertainment to those who delight to observe the instincts and economy of the feathered race; and who shrink from the minute adjustment of classification and synonymy. It ought, however, to be remembered that few authentic facts have been collected relative to the history of these foreign birds; and that though future travellers may increase the scanty stock of interesting notices, the exertions of the present author may not a little contribute to systematize and facilitate their observations.\n\nThe Natural History of Birds, by George Edwards, Edwards, in four quarto volumes, without any reference to country or method, contains many excellent coloured designs, and correct descriptions; and the same remark applies to his Gleanings of Natural History, the most considerable portion of which relates to birds.\n\nSeveral of his countrymen have expounded or delineated the birds of our own island with more or less ornithologists' city of manner. The ornithological part of Pennant's British Zoology, Hayes's Natural History of British Birds, with their portraits accurately drawn, and beautifully coloured from nature; Lord's Natural History of British Birds, Lewin's Birds of Great Britain, with their eggs, in three volumes quarto, Walcott's Synopsis of British Birds, two volumes quarto, Bewick's History of British Birds, with figures engraved on wood, &c. &c. are all entitled to critical notice; but the limitation of our plan forbids us to dwell on them. We shall, therefore, close this portion of our introduction by pointing to a work which seems not yet to have procured its due share of the public favour; we mean the Ornithological Dictionary, or Alphabetical Synopsis of British Birds, by George Montagu, F. L. S. &c. in two small octavo volumes. We are acquainted with few publications of the kind that contain a larger quantity of accurate and important information within such a narrow compass. As a book of reference and consultation, it is well calculated to suit the occasions of ordinary readers, and even to convey instruction to the learned student. The synopses and specific descriptions evince much diligence and accuracy; and various articles are enriched by the result of personal observation and extensive travel. Sufficiently aware of the fallible indications of plumage, the writer is more solicitous to reduce than to multiply distinctions; and in doubtful cases, has sometimes had recourse to the unequivocal test of dissection. A few of the articles, however, are dismissed with too much brevity, and the style is very deficient in polish and correctness.\n\nIf any of our readers are desirous of procuring a more complete catalogue of works published on ornithology prior to the year 1760, they will find it in Gronovius's Bibliotheca regni animalis atque lapidei, ac recensio autorum et librorum qui de regno animali et lapideo, methodice, physicè, &c. tractant.\n\nThe structure of the feathered tribes, and their habits of life, are wonderfully adapted to the various functions which they are destined to perform. The pointed beak, the long and plant neck, the gently swelling shoulder, the expansive wings, the tapering tail, the light and bony feet, are all wisely calculated to assist and accelerate their motion through the yielding air. Every part of their frame is formed for lightness and buoyancy; their bodies are covered with a soft and delicate plumage, so disposed as to protect them from the intense cold of the atmosphere through which they pass; their wings are made of the lightest materials, and yet the force with which they strike the air is so great, as to impel their bodies forward with astonishing rapidity, while the tail serves the purpose of a rudder to direct them to the different objects of their pursuit. The internal structure of birds is no less wisely adapted to the fame.\nsame purposes; all the bones are light and thin, and all the muscles, except those which are appropriated to the movements of the wings, are extremely light and delicate. The lungs are placed close to the back bone and ribs. The air, entering into them by a communication from the windpipe, passes through, and is conveyed into a number of membranous cells which lie on the sides of the pericardium, and communicate with those of the sternum. In some birds, these cells are continued down the wings, and extended even to the pinions, thigh bones, and other parts of the body, which can be filled and defended with air at the pleasure of the animal. The feathers, too, and particularly those of the wings, contain a great quantity of air. The almost universal diffusion of this fluid in the bodies of birds is of infinite use to them, not only in their long and laborious flights, but likewise in preventing their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium. Were it possible for man to move with the swiftness of a swallow, the actual resistance of the air, as he is not provided with internal reservoirs similar to those of birds, would soon suffocate him.\n\nBirds, like quadrupeds, may be divided into granivorous and carnivorous. The former are furnished with larger intestines than those of the latter. Their food, which consists of grain of various sorts, is conveyed entire into the first stomach, or craw, where it undergoes a partial dilution by a liquor secreted from the glands, and spread over its surface. It is then received into another species of stomach, where it is farther diluted, after which it is transmitted into the gizzard, or true stomach, consisting of two very strong muscles, externally covered with a tendinous substance, and lined with a thick membrane of prodigious power and strength, in which organ the food is completely triturated, and prepared for the operation of the gastric juices. In order to ascertain the strength of these stomachs, Spallanzani had recourse to a great variety of ingenious experiments. Tin tubes, full of grain, were forced into the stomachs of turkeys, and, after remaining 20 hours, were found to be broken, compressed, and distorted in the most irregular manner. In the space of 24 hours, the stomach of a cock broke off the angles of a piece of rough jagged glass, though, on examining the gizzard, no wound or laceration appeared. In a ball of lead were fixed 12 strong needles, with the points projecting about a quarter of an inch from the surface. Thus armed, the ball was covered with a case of paper, and forced down the throat of a turkey. The bird retained it a day and a half without manifesting any symptoms of uneasiness, and the points of all the needles were broken off close to the surface of the ball, except two or three, of which the stumps projected a little. The same interesting observer relates, that he fixed 12 small and very sharp lancets, in a similar ball of lead, which was given in the same manner to a turkey cock, and left eight hours in the stomach, at the expiration of which the organ was opened; but nothing appeared except the naked ball, the lancets having been broken to pieces, and the stomach remaining sound and entire. Hence we may infer, that the stones so often found in the stomachs of many of the feathered tribes, may powerfully contribute to the comminution of grain and other hard substances which constitute their food.\n\nGranivorous birds partake much of the nature and disposition of herbivorous quadrupeds, agreeing with them in the number of their stomachs, the comparative length and capacity of their intestines, the quality of their food, and the gentleness of their manners. Contented with the seeds of plants, with fruits, insects, and worms, their principal attention is directed to procuring food, hatching and rearing their offspring, and eluding the fancies of men, and the attacks of predaceous animals. As they are generally tractable and easily domesticated, man has selected for his own advantage those which are most prolific and profitable. Of these the hen, goose, turkey, and duck, are the most considerable, and form a valuable store of rich, wholesome, and nutritious food.\n\nCarnivorous birds are provided with wings of great length, the muscles which move them being proportionally large and strong, so that they are enabled to keep long on the wing, in search of their prey. They are, besides, armed with strong hooked bills, and sharp and formidable claws. They have large heads, short necks, strong and brawny thighs, and a flight so acute and piercing, as to enable them to view their prey from the greatest heights in the air, and to dart down on it with incredible swiftness and undeviating aim. Their stomachs are smaller than those of the granivorous kinds, and their intestines are much shorter. The analogy between carnivorous birds and quadrupeds, is too obvious to escape the notice of even the superficial observer. Both of them are provided with weapons which indicate destruction and rapine, their manners are fierce and unfeeling, and they seldom congregate, like the offensive granivorous tribes; but, when not on the wing, retire to the tops of sequestered rocks, or to the depths of extensive forests, where they conceal themselves in fullest and gloomy solitude. Such of them as feed on carrion, have the sense of smelling so acute, that they can scent carcases at astonishing distances.\n\nWithout the means of conveying themselves with great swiftness from one place to another, birds could not easily subsist; the food which nature has provided for them being so irregularly distributed, that they are obliged to take long journeys to distant parts in order to procure the necessary supplies. Hence one cause of those migrations which are so peculiar to the feathered race. Besides the want of food, however, two other causes may be assigned, namely, the want of a proper temperature of air, and of a convenient situation for the important work of breeding and rearing their young. Such birds as migrate to great distances, are alone denominated birds of passage; but most species are more or less so, although they do not move to places remote from their former habitations. At particular periods of the year, most birds remove from one country to another, or from the more inland districts towards the shores, or vice versa. The reasons of these migrations are observed with the most astonishing order and punctuality; but the secrecy with which immense flocks take their departure, and the suddenness with which they reappear, are not easily explained. We are also apt to suppose, that, during long flights over immense tracts of water, the means of subsistence would inevitably fail, without reflecting on the superior velocity with which birds are carried forward in the air, and the ease with which they continue their exertions for a much longer\nlonger time than can be done by the strongest quadruped. Our swiftest horses are supposed to go at the rate of a mile in somewhat less than two minutes; and there is one instance on record of a horse that went at the rate of nearly a mile in one minute, but only for one second of time. In such cases an uncommon degree of exertion has been attended with its usual consequences, debility, and a total want of power to continue that exertion; but the motions of birds are not impeded by similar causes, and they not only glide through the air with a quickness superior to that of the swiftest quadrupeds, but can continue on the wing with equal speed for a considerable length of time. Now, if we can suppose a bird to go at the rate of only half a mile in a minute, for the space of 24 hours, it will, in that time, have gone over an extent of more than 750 miles; which is sufficient to account for almost the longest migration; and, if aided by a favourable current of air, there is reason to believe, that it will perform the same journey in a much shorter space of time.\n\nThe wings of birds are so constructed, that, in striking downwards, they expand very considerably, and, except that they are somewhat hollow on the under side, they form, in this act, almost two planes. The muscles that move the wings downwards are very large, and have been estimated, in some instances, at not less than the fifth part of the weight of the whole body. When a bird is on the ground, and intends to fly, it takes a leap, stretches its wings from the body, and strikes them downwards with great force. By this stroke, they are put into an oblique direction, partly upwards, and partly horizontally forwards. That part of the force which tends upwards is destroyed by the weight of the bird, while the horizontal impulse serves to carry it forwards. The stroke being completed, it moves its wings; and they, being contracted, and having their edges turned upwards, meet with very little resistance from the air. When they are sufficiently elevated, it makes a second stroke downwards, and the impulse of the air again moves it forward. These successive strokes act as many leaps taken in the air. When the bird wants to turn to the right or left, it strikes strongly with the opposite wing, so as to impel the body to the proper side. If it wants to rise, it raises its tail, and if to fall, depresses it. When in a horizontal position, the tail keeps the body steady. A bird, by spreading its wings, can continue to move horizontally in the air for some time, without striking, because it has acquired a sufficient velocity; and the wings, being parallel to the horizon, meet with but small resistance. On alighting, it expands its wings and tail full against the air, that they may meet with all possible resistance. The centre of gravity in birds is somewhat behind the wings; and, to counterbalance it, most of them may be observed to thrust out their head and neck in flying. This is very apparent in the flight of ducks, geese, and several species of water-fowl, whose centre of gravity is farther backwards than in the land birds. In the heron, on the contrary, whose long head and neck, although folded up in flight, overbalance the rest of the body, the long legs are extended, in order to give the proper counterpoise, and to supply what is wanting in the shortness of the tail.\n\nThe feathers of birds would constantly imbibe the moisture of the atmosphere; and, during rain, absorb so much wet, as would almost, if not wholly, impede their flight, had not the wise economy of nature obviated this by a most effectual expedient. They are furnished on the rump with two glands, in which a quantity of unctuous matter is constantly secreting. This is occasionally preflled out by means of the bill, and used for the lubrication of the feathers. The birds which share, as it were, the habitations of man, and live principally under cover, do not require so large a supply of this fluid, and, consequently, are not provided with such a large stock of it as those that rove abroad, and reside in the open element. Hence poultry, when wet, assume a ruffled and uncomfortable appearance.\n\nAs birds are continually puffing among hedges and nettling thickets, their eyes are protected from external injuries, membrane, as well as from too much light, when flying in opposition to the sun's rays, by a nettling or winking membrane, which can at pleasure be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain. This covering is neither opaque, nor wholly pellucid, but somewhat transparent. By means of it the eagle is said to gaze at the sun.\n\nIt appears from observations, founded on numerous song experiments, that the peculiar notes, or songs, of the different species of birds, are altogether acquired, and are no more innate than language is in man. The attempt of a netting to sing, may be compared with the imperfect endeavour of a child to talk. The first effort seems not to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song; but, as the bird grows older and stronger, it is not difficult to perceive its aim. While the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his song, when he is once sure of a passage, he commonly raises his tone, which he drops again when he is not equal to what he is attempting. A common sparrow, taken from the nest when very young, and placed near a linnet and goldfinch, though in a wild state it would only have chirped, adopted a song that was a mixture of these two. Three netting linnets were educated, one under a skylark, another under a wood-lark, and a third under a tit-lark; and, instead of the song peculiar to their own species, they adhered entirely to that of their respective instructors. A linnet, taken from the nest, when but two or three days old, and brought up in the house of an apothecary at Kennington, from want of other sounds to imitate, almost articulated the words \"pretty boy,\" as well as some other short sentences. These and other well-authenticated facts seem to prove, that birds have no innate notes, but that the language of those to whose care they are committed at birth, will be the language which they adopt in after life. It may, however, appear somewhat unaccountable why, in a wild state, they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only, when so many others are to be heard around them. This arises from the attention paid by the netting bird to the instructions of its own parent only, generally disregarding the notes of all the rest. Persons, however, who have an accurate ear, and have studied the notes of different birds, can very often distinguish some that have a song mixed with those of another species; but these are in general so trifling as scarcely to be reckoned anything more than mere varieties of provincial dialects.\n\nAll birds are oviparous, or produce eggs, from which, after the process of incubation, the young are extruded. These eggs differ in different species, in respect of number, figure, and colour. They contain the\nrudiments of the future young, for the maturation of which a bubble of air is always placed at the large end, betwixt the shell and the inside skin. It is supposed, that, from the warmth communicated by the fitting bird to this confined air, its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor, and at the same time its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction. Hence prelude and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg, and seem, in some unknown way, gradually to promote the growth of the young till the appointed time of ex- citation. Houfewives, when they suspect an egg is not good, put their tongue to the great end, to feel if it be warm. If that is not the case, it is considered a certain proof, that the air, having, by degrees, effected its escape, the egg is at length become putrid or ad- dled.\n\nThe nests of birds are, in general, constructed with astonishing art, and with a degree of skill and neatness that often defies the efforts of the human hands. Both the male and female generally assist in this interesting concern. They each bring materials to the place, as sticks, moss, straws, &c. for the foundation and exterior; and hair, wool, or the down of animals or plants, to form a soft and commodious bed for their eggs, and for the tender bodies of their young when hatched. The outside of the nest usually bears no great resemblance in colour to the surrounding foliage or branches, as not easily to be discovered even by persons who are in search of them.\n\nThe term of life varies greatly in birds, and does not seem to bear the same proportion to the time of acquiring their growth as has been remarked with regard to quadrupeds. Most birds acquire their full dimensions in a few months, and are capable of propagation the first summer after they are hatched. In proportion to the size of their bodies, they possess more vitality, and live longer, than either man or quadrupeds. Notwithstanding the difficulties which arise in ascertaining the ages of birds, there are instances of great longevity in many of them, particularly geese, swans, ravens, and eagles, which have been known to attain to the age of seventy, fourscore, or even a century. Pigeons usually live more than twenty years, and even linnets and other small birds have been kept in cages for nearly the same period.\n\nThe diseases to which birds, in their natural state, are incident, are probably neither numerous nor formidable; at least we seldom meet with individuals of the feathered race which seem to labour under sickness or infirmity. In our northern latitudes they are indeed frequently subjected to the prelude of cold and hunger; but the debility and other symptoms attendant on these external accidents, hardly deserve to be noticed in a zoological point of view. Seclusion from the open air, and a total change of habits, induced by confinement and domestication, are usually accompanied by appropriate disorders, such as the pip, or swelling on the extremity of the tongue, a softening of the bill, a gradual decay of the feet, convulsions, and general pinching. The moulting process, from which none of the species are exempted, may also be regarded, in some measure, as a diseased state of the animal. All birds moult, or cast their feathers once, and some twice, in the course of a year. This change takes place in autumn, or in the season which corresponds to it in different climates, and uniformly after the breeding season. Those which moult twice a year, also change their feathers in spring. Most of the young males, which bear originally the plumage of the mother, assume, at their first moulting, the colouring which they afterwards retain; but some species do not put on their characteristic garb till the end of the second, or even of the third year. Among those which moult twice a year, both males and females change their plumage; but the latter retain the same markings, while the former exhibit a more gaudy covering in the season which precedes their pairing, and a more sober one, often similar to that of the female, after the period of breeding. In most cases, the feathers fall off in gradual succession; but in some species nearly the whole plumage comes off at once, and is speedily replaced. This periodical affection is always attended with more or less languor and depression.\n\nFor the anatomy of birds, we beg leave to refer to Anatomy, the article Comparative ANATOMY; and shall close this introduction by a brief explanation of some of the most important technical terms in ornithology, employed by Technical Pennant and Linnaeus.\n\n1. Cere (Cera, Lin.),—the naked skin which covers the base of the bill in the hawk kind.\n\n2. Capillium,—a word used by Linnaeus to express the short feathers on the forehead just above the bill. In some birds, these feathers fall forward over the nostrils; they quite cover those of the crow.\n\n3. Lore (Lorum, Lin.),—the space between the bill and the eye, generally covered with feathers; but, in some birds, as in the black and white grebe, naked.\n\n4. Orbis (Orbita, Lin.),—the skin that surrounds the eye, which is generally bare, particularly in the heron and parrot.\n\n5. Emarginatus (Emarginatum),—said of a bill which has a small notch near the end, as that of the butcher bird, thrush, &c.\n\n6. Vibrissae pectinatae,—stiff hairs which grow on each side of the mouth, formed like a double comb, as in the goatfucker, fly-catcher, &c.\n\n7. Alula Spuria, Sparious or bastard wing,—a small joint rising at the end of the middle part of the wing, or the cubitus, on which there are three or five feathers.\n\n8. Tectrices princeps, Lesser wing-coverts,—the small feathers which lie in several rows on the bones of the wings. The under coverts are those that line the inside of the wings.\n\n9. Tectrices secundae, Greater coverts,—the feathers which lie immediately over the quill-feathers and the secondaries.\n\n10. Primores, Quill-feathers or Primaries,—the largest feathers of the wings, or those that rise from the first bone.\n\n11. Secondaries, Secondary feathers or Secondaries,—those that rise from the second bone.\n\n12. Tail-coverts, (Uropygium),—those which cover the base of the tail on the upper side.\n\n13. Vent-feathers (Criftum),—those which lie from the vent to the tail, underneath.\n\n14. Rictrices, Tail-feathers.\n\n15. Scapulars, or Scapular feathers,—those which take their rise from the shoulders, and cover the sides of the back.\n\n16. Nucha,—the hind part of the head.\n17. **Subulatum**, Subulated or awl-shaped,—applied to a bill that is straight and slender, in the form of an awl.\n\n18. **Pes ambulatorius,**—all the toes divided to the bottom.\n\n19. **Pes gregorius,**—the outer toe more or less united to the middle one, particularly conspicuous in the feet of the king's fisher.\n\n20. **Pes scamnarius,**—formed for climbing, like the foot of the woodpecker.\n\n21. **Pes lobatus,**—finned, or lobed, like those of the grebes.\n\n22. **Pes pinnatus,**—pinnated, or scoloped. The webs indented in the fides, as in coots and sandpipers.\n\n23. **Pes tridactylus, or curvatus,**—wanting the back toe.\n\n24. **Pes didactylus,**—composed of only two toes, as in the ostrich.\n\n25. **Pes semi-palmatus, Semi-palmated,**—when the webs reach only half the length of the toes.\n\n26. **Ungue pediculatum,**—when the hind claw adheres to the leg without any toe, as in the petrels.\n\n27. **Digitus quattuor omnibus palmatis,**—all the four toes connected by webs, as in the corvornant.\n\n28. **Rostrum cultratum,**—when the edges of the bill are very sharp, as in that of the crow.\n\n29. **Lingua ciliata,**—a tongue edged with fine bristles, like that of the duck.\n\n30. **Integra,**—plain, or even.\n\n31. **Lumbiciformis,**—when the tongue is long, round, and slender, like a worm, as that of the woodpecker.\n\n32. **Pedes compedes,**—when the legs are placed so far behind as to make the bird walk with difficulty, or as if in fetters, of which we have examples in the auks, grebes, and divers.\n\n33. **Nares lineares,**—when the nostrils are very narrow, as in sea gulls.\n\n34. **Emarginatae,**—with a rim round the nostrils, as in the stork.\n\n**Iris,** is that part which surrounds the pupil of the eye.\n\n**Mandibles,** denote the upper and under parts of the bill.\n\n**Compressed,**—vertically flattened at the sides.\n\n**Depressed,**—horizontally flattened.\n\n**Caruncula,**—a fleshy excrescence on the head.\n\n**Hypochondria,**—the hinder sides of the breast and abdomen.\n\n**Ocellated,**—with roundish concentric spots, of different colours.\n\n**Phalanges,**—the articulations of the toes.\n\n---\n\n**SYSTEMATIC EXPOSITION OF THE CLASS.**\n\nAccording to the Linnaean method, the class of Aves, or Birds, is distributed into six Orders, denominated Accipitres, Picae, Anseres, Grallae, Gallinæ, and Pafferes.\n\n**Order I. Accipitres.**\n\nThis natural order includes birds of prey, that have the bill somewhat hooked downwards, the upper mandible dilated near the point, or armed with a tooth, the nostrils wide, the feet short and strong, with four toes, three of which are placed forwards, and one behind; toes warty under the joints; claws hooked and sharp-pointed. They live on other animals alive or dead, and are themselves not eatable. They are monogamous, or live in pairs. The females are larger and more beautiful than the males, and generally lay about four eggs. This order includes vultur, falco, strix, and lanius.\n\n**Gen. I. Vultur, Vulture.**\n\nBill straight, hooked at the point; head bare of feathers.\n\nBirds of this genus are distinguished from eagles and hawks, by being gregarious, by the comparative heaviness of their flight, and by their living on carrion. The females, too, are hardly larger than the males. Unless preffed by hunger, they seldom attack living animals; they fly slowly, unless when very high in the air, and have an exquisite sense of smell. The tongue is large and fleshy; the legs and feet are strong, and mostly covered with scales; and the wings are lined, on the inside, with down.\n\n**Condor, condur, or cuntur.**—Very large, with a runcle on the crown of the head, the whole of its length; the throat naked. Quills of the wings two feet and a half long, and an inch and a half thick; body black, back white; neck ruffled with long white feathers; throat red; head brown, and woolly; eyes black, irides chestnut; bill black, but tipped with white; feet black; claws straight; tail small.—The female differs from the male, in having a tuft on the neck, in its brown colour, and in having no ruff. Britton, however, has properly remarked, that the plumage of this species varies in colour, a circumstance which will, in some measure, account for the discordant descriptions of different authors. At the same time, we must regret, that the history of this enormous bird is so imperfectly known. Its extent of wing is variously stated, from nine to eighteen feet; and, while Freiser attributes to it sufficient strength to carry off sheep, and boys of ten years old, Marco Paolo stoutly affirms, that it can lift an elephant from the ground high enough to kill it by the fall. Though very rare, Buffon suspects that it is not confined to South America, and that it does not essentially differ from the roc of the eastern nations, so famous in the Arabian tales; nor from the laemmer geyer of the German Alps. A preserved specimen in the Leverian Museum measured ten feet, from the tip of one wing to that of the other. It is described and figured in the second supplement to Latham's Synopsis. In Chili, the condors make their nests among the most inaccessible rocks, and lay two white eggs bigger than those of a turkey. They feed on dead carcases, and sometimes prey on sheep, goats, or even young calves, when they stray far from their dams, falling on them in flocks, plucking out their eyes, and tearing them in pieces. The country people\nAccipitres. use every means to destroy such formidable invaders of their property, and seem to have succeeded in expelling them from the populous districts of both continents.\n\nKing vulture, or king of the vultures.—Caruncles on the nostrils; crown of the head and neck bare of feathers. The extreme length of the body does not exceed two feet three inches, and it is not thicker than the hen turkey. Its wings are short in proportion to the other vultures. The bill is thick and short, and begins its curvature only at the point; in some individuals it is entirely red, in others only red at the extremity, and black in the middle. In the cere, which is broad and orange-coloured, are placed the nostrils; and between them the skin projects like a loose jagged comb, falling indifferently on either side, according as the bird moves its head. Under the naked part of the neck is a collar, or ruff, composed of pretty long soft feathers of a deep ash colour, and so broad, that when the bird contracts itself, it can conceal the neck and part of the head like a cowl, whence some naturalists have given it the name of monk. The feathers on the breast, belly, thighs, legs, and the under surface of the tail, are white, slightly tinged with yellow; those of the rump and upper surface of the tail, are black in some individuals, and white in others. The other feathers of the tail are always black, and so are the great feathers of the wings, which are commonly edged with grey. The king of the vultures is a native of South America and the West Indies, and lives on carrion, rats, lizards, snakes, and excrements of all kinds, from which circumstance it has a most offensive odour.\n\nCarrion vulture, or turkey buzzard (carrion crow of Jamaica).—Body gray brown; quill feathers black; bill white; the sides of the head wanting; legs flesh-coloured. Common in the West Indies, and in N. and S. America. Somewhat larger than the black eagle. Is protected in America for its use in devouring dead carcases and serpents, which it does, along with dogs, in the greatest harmony. It will seize meat from the flambles, breathes a most fetid odour, and, when taken, vomits up an intolerably stinking matter. Roosts by night, in flocks, on the highest branches of trees. They are generally very tame in their wild state, probably owing to their being more careful than molested by man.\n\nWhite, a/b-coloured, or Angola vulture.—Body snowy; quill and tail feathers black; collar white; head and lower part of the neck covered with white down; middle toe covered with 11 distinct scales; claws black. About the size of a female turkey. The female exceeds the male in size, and differs chiefly in being less tinged with reddish. The young have the whole of the naked parts about the head covered with a grayish down.—This species is usually seen in pairs, and not in large flocks, like many of the genus; or, if 10 or 12 alight on one carcass, they are accidentally allured by the smell, which acts on their delicate organs at inconceivable distances. They feed on all manner of carrion, and on lizards, snakes, frogs, and even excrements. They build among the rocks, and lay four eggs. In some parts of Africa they are very common, and in others more rare. The natives tame and respect them, as they contribute to rid their grounds of nuisances. They likewise occur in Norway and Sardinia. Mr Latham supposes that this species is the vautour de Norvège of Buffon; the fauve d'Egypte of the same author, perhaps the Angola vulture of Pennant, and the rachianzah of Bruce. \"When, however, (adds this celebrated ornithologist), the division of the vulture genus into real species may take place, is not for us to determine; the variety among individuals, from different periods of life, as well as the different appearances of those in a state of confinement, to what the plumage has, when at large, cannot fail to create no small difficulty; added to that, very few travellers are naturalists in a sufficient degree to discriminate one part of nature from another; besides, the subjects in question being mostly extra European, we cannot wonder at being so long in the dark.\"\n\nAquiline or Alpine vulture.—The male of this species is almost wholly white; quill feathers black, with hoary edges, except the two outermost, which are wholly black. The female is all over brown, with the four outer quills black. In both the bill is black; cere yellow; nostrils constantly dripping moisture; feet naked. Inhabits Egypt, Palestine, Syria, and Persia. They fly in large troops, and are extremely useful in destroying mice, with which some countries, of which they are natives, are infested, such as Palestine. The same species, it is said, inhabits the Swiss Alps, where they are of an immense size. Some have been measured exceeding 12 feet from tip to tip of the wings.\n\nGen. 2. Falco, Falcon.\n\nBill hooked, and furnished with a cere at the base; head covered with clove-feet feathers; tongue bifid.\n\nThough the birds of this genus are all carnivorous, they seldom feed on carrion, except when preyed by hunger, which they can endure for a long time. They have a very acute sight, and pounce down on their prey with astonishing swiftness and force. From their great strength, they are capable of carrying birds nearly as heavy as themselves, to a great distance, for provision to their young. Their middle toe is slightly connected with the outermost.\n\nA. Bill hooked only at the point, bearded at the base with extended bristles.\n\nSnake-eater, or secretary vulture.—Body black; hind-head crested; tail feathers white at the tips, the two middle ones longest; legs very long. Bill black, cere white; orbits orange, and naked; irides pale cinereous; tail rounded; legs brownish; claws short, black, hooked, not very sharp; crest capable of being erected or depressed.—In seizing its prey, this bird makes use of its wings, with which it inflicts violent blows by means of a bony protuberance at the bend of the wing. It is also by its wings that it defends itself against the bites of venomous snakes, until the latter, tired with their efforts, or nearly bruised to death, are easily dispatched. This species likewise preys on turtles, lizards, and even grasshoppers and other insects. When in a domesticated state scarcely any kind of food comes amiss to it; and, if young birds are presented to it, it will take them by the bill foremoft, and swallow them whole. One of those which Le Vaillant killed, had 21 young turtles, 11 small lizards, and three snakes, in his stomach. Like other birds of prey, it is observed to bring up the undigested parts of its food, in the form of round pellets. In pairing time, two males will often be found engaged in a violent contest for a female. The secretary vulture is\nAccipiter is three feet high, remarkable for the length of its legs, and inhabits interior Africa and the Philippine islands. These birds make a flat nest, like that of the eagle, full three feet in diameter, lined with wool and feathers, in some high tuft of trees, and usually concealed from observation.\n\nCrested or Oronooko eagle.—Head crested with long feathers; body beneath variegated; eyes with a nictitating membrane. Under the crop, white feathers, which, when the bird is irritated, fall to the ground. Erects the crest in the form of a coronet, is said to be able to cleave a man's skull at a stroke. Inhabits Mexico, Brazil, and other parts of South America, and is as large as a sheep.\n\nCinerous or white-tailed eagle: erne of the Scots.—Cere and feet yellow; tail feathers white, the middle ones tipped with black; head and neck pale cinereous; irides and bill pale yellow; nostrils, and the space between the eyes, bluish, with a few bristles; body and wings cinereous, mixed with brown; tail white; legs, below the knees, downy, glossy yellow; claws black. Size of a turkey, feeds on birds and fish. Inhabits Europe, and frequently occurs in Scotland and the Orkney islands.\n\nB. Feet generally feathered, of a large size.\n\nBlack eagle.—Cere yellow; feet yellow, and somewhat downy; body rusty black, with yellow streaks; bill horn colour, verging on blue; irides chestnut; exterior part of the tail white, with blackish spots, tip whitish; legs dirty white; toes yellow, claws black. Two feet ten inches long. Inhabits Europe and America.\n\nOsprey, or sea eagle.—Cere and legs yellow; feet half covered with down; body of a rusty colour; inner vanes of the tail feathers white. It is distinguished by the colour and figure of its nails, which are of a thinning black, and form an entire semicircle; by its legs, which are naked below, and covered with small yellow scales; and by the beard of feathers which hangs from the chin, and which has occasioned its receiving the name of the bearded eagle. It measures, from the end of the bill to the point of the nails, three feet and a half, and its wings expand to between six and seven feet. It loves to haunt the sea shore, and often frequents inland tracts, near lakes, marshes, or rivers that are stocked with fish; but, though it preys on the finny tribe, it also attacks game, and, being large and strong, seizes and carries off geese and hares, and sometimes even lambs and kids. It catches fish even during the night, when the noise of its plunging into the water is heard at a great distance. In attempting to lay hold of overgrown fish, it is sometimes dragged under water, being unable to disengage its talons. It inhabits Europe and North America, and was found by Captain Cook, in Botany island. It is not uncommon in Scotland and Ireland. \"From the afflicting height (says Mr Montagu), these and some other birds fly, we are led to believe they are capable of living in a much lighter air than other animals. From the top of some of the highest mountains in Scotland we have seen several soaring together at a great distance as to appear scarcely larger than a swallow.\"—The female sea eagle seldom lays more than two eggs, and sometimes produces only a single young one.\n\nGolden eagle.—Cere yellow; feet downy, and rusty-coloured; body dark brown, irregularly barred; tail black, and covered with ash-coloured bars. It greatly resembles the preceding, but is distinguished from it chiefly by its legs, which are yellow, short, strong, and covered with feathers to the feet. The general length of this species is about three feet and a half; the breadth eight feet; and it usually weighs about twelve pounds. It breeds in the most inaccessible rocks, and lays three or four white eggs. It inhabits Europe and Siberia, and is said to be not unfrequent in the mountainous parts of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, though it has been frequently confounded with the sea eagle. It feeds on lambs, kids, and all kinds of game, and has been known to carry off infants to its nest. It is remarkable for its longevity and abstinence from food; some having been kept in menageries for upwards of a century; and Pennant records an instance of one which lived twenty-one days without any sustenance whatever. It flies high, during serene weather, and defends nearer the earth in storms.\n\nRing-tailed, white-tailed, black, or common eagle.—Fulvus Cere yellow; feet downy, and of rusty a brown colour; back brown; tail with a white transverse band. In the bill, cere, irides, and legs, it resembles the preceding, to which it is also nearly equal in size; but the plumage is rather darker, and the tail is white for two thirds of its length. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and America; and is trained by the Tartars to hunt hares, antelopes, and foxes. In Scotland, it is very destructive to deer, which it will seize between the horns; and, by incessantly beating it with its wings, soon makes a prey of the harried animal. It likewise makes great havoc among the white hares and ptarmigans. It builds in high precipices and cliffs; and the nest of a pair has been observed in the same spot, in the Orkney islands, beyond the memory of man. Willoughby describes a nest of this species found in the Peak of Derbyshire, as composed of large sticks, lined with two layers of rushes, between which was one of heath. It contained one young, and an addle egg, and by them a lamb, a hare, and three heath pouts.—There is a variety, with a white tail, tipped with brown.\n\nWhite eagle.—Entirely white. Inhabits the Alps; of the size of the golden eagle.\n\nFierce eagle.—Cere green; body brown above; back, belly, and tail coverts snowy, variegated with chestnut spots; tail feathers equal, brown, with four paler bands; bill leaden-black; eyelids blue; irides yellow; head and neck ferruginous, mixed with whitish; quill-feathers twenty-five, black above, white beneath, tipped with grey; tail feathers twelve, white beneath; claws sharp; upwards of two feet long; very rapacious; inhabits Russia, was found frequent near Astrachan in the winter of 1769; will not touch dead animals.\n\nKite.—Cere yellow; tail forked; body brown; head whitish or grey; back and wing coverts dusky, edged with ferruginous, the under parts more or less ferruginous, streaked with dusky, and lightest on the breast; quill feathers dusky black, with bars more or less obscure; tail bright ferruginous; legs yellow; claws black. But there are several varieties. The female is somewhat larger than the male, measuring in length two feet four inches, and five feet six inches of outstretched wing. It is readily distinguished from its congeners by the remarkable forking of its tail, and by its smooth and even flight, which resembles a gliding through the air.\nAccipitres, air, without any apparent motion of its wings. It frequently, however, soars very high, and, though beyond the reach of human vision, will distinctly perceive its prey, and dart down on it with irresistible force. Its attacks are confined to such animals as are found on the ground, such as young rabbits, hares, game of all kinds, poultry, and young birds incapable of flying. It will also destroy young lambs, and feed greedily on carrion; but, in default of these, will readily devour mice, rats, worms, and even snakes.—The kite occurs as far north as Greenland, and as far south as Guinea and Senegal. It is common in England, where it continues the whole year; but in the more northerly latitudes, it retires to Egypt before winter, and is said to breed there, and returns in April to Europe, where it breeds a second time, contrary to the nature of rapacious birds in general. The nest is composed of sticks, and lined with wool, the inner bark of a tree, hair, and other soft materials, and is usually made in the fork of some large tree. The eggs are generally three, rarely four, somewhat larger than those of a hen, of a dirty white, with a few rusty spots at the larger end.\n\nBald-buzzard, or grey, fishing hawk, &c.—Cere and feet blue; body brownish above, white below; head whitish; a brown bar extends from each eye by the sides of the neck to the wings; legs naked, short, strong; claws remarkably long, hooked, and black. Inhabits Europe, Siberia, and America, frequenting marshy places, and the neighbourhood of large rivers and lakes, pouncing on fish with great rapidity and dexterity, and carrying them off in its talons to a small distance to feed on them. It builds its nest on the ground among reeds, and lays three or four eggs of an elliptical form, rather less than those of a hen. Mr Montagu found the nest of this bird on the top of a chimney of a ruin in one of the islands of Loch Lomond. The usual length of the bald buzzard is two feet, and its extent of wing five. The species is now rarely met with in England, but may be frequently seen near the lake of Killarney in Ireland. There are several varieties, among which may be included those of Carolina and Cayenne. Some of the ancient writers, and even Linnaeus, have very erroneously alleged, that the left foot of the bald-buzzard is subpalmated.\n\nC. Legs naked, of a smaller size.\n\nBuzzard, or Putock.—Cere and feet yellow; body brown; belly pale, with brown spots. Scarcely any two individuals of this well-known species are precisely alike. The ordinary length of the body is twenty inches, and the extent of wing four feet and a half. The buzzard is one of our most common species of falcon. It is remarkable for its sluggish, inactive disposition, seldom remaining long on wing, except in the breeding season, when it ascends spirally to a great height. It makes its nest in the fork of a tree, of large sticks, and lines it with wool, hair, and other substances, and sometimes takes possession of a deserted crow's nest, which it accommodates to its purposes. The eggs are two or three, rather larger than a hen's, of a dirty white, and, for the most part, with rufous-coloured spots at the larger end. It feeds and tends its young with great affluence; and Ray affirms, that, if the female be killed, the male takes charge of them, and patiently rears them till they are able to provide for themselves. This bird will continue for many hours perched on a tree or eminence, whence it darts on such birds, small quadrupeds, reptiles, or insects, as come within its reach.\n\nHoney buzzard.—Cere black; feet half naked, and Apivorus, yellow; head ash-coloured; tail with cinereous bands, and tipped with white; of nearly the same size as the preceding, and, like it, subject to considerable varieties in its markings. Its nest, in respect of form and materials, is similar to that of the buzzard, and it sometimes occupies that of other birds. Its eggs are of an ash-colour, with small brown spots. Mr White of Selborne found only one egg in the nest, smaller, and not so round as that of the buzzard. The name seems to have been given it from its feeding on the larvae of wasps; but it is also fond of various other insects, and of field mice, frogs, and lizards. It occurs in all the northern parts of Europe, and in the open tracts of Russia and Siberia, but is far from common in England. Buffon observes, that it is frequently caught in the winter, when it is fat and delicious eating.\n\nMoor buzzard, duck hawk, or white-headed harpy.—Arrogino-Cere green; body brownish; crown of the head, throat, axillae, and feet, yellow. The colouring, however, is subject to considerable variety. Length twenty-one inches; weight twenty ounces. Preys on rabbits, young wild ducks, and other water fowl; and likewise feeds on fish, frogs, reptiles, and even insects; making its haunts in hedges and bushes near pools, marshes, and rivers. The nest is most frequently made on the ground, among short wood, furze, or fern, and sometimes, though rarely, in the fork of a tree. It is composed of sticks and rushes, or coarse grass. The moor buzzard is not a bird of rapid flight, but pounces its prey on the ground, and is generally seen skimming over the surface; but, in the breeding season, the male will sometimes soar to a considerable height, and remain suspended on wing for a great length of time. Inhabits Europe.\n\nGo-bawk.—Cere black; feet yellow; body brown; Palumba-tail feathers barred with pale bands, a white line over the eye; bill blue, black at the tip; irides yellow; head brown; body beneath white, waved with black; tail long, cinereous, and white at the tip; claws black. The wing, when closed, does not reach near the end of the tail; of an elegant slender shape, twenty-two inches long. Inhabits Europe, Tartary, and America; is rarely found in England, but is not uncommon in the more wooded districts of Scotland, where it breeds, and is a great destroyer of game. It feeds on small birds and mice, and eagerly devours raw flesh. It tears birds to pieces before it eats them, but swallows the pieces entire, and frequently disgorges the hair and feathers, rolled up in small pellets. This species was formerly much prized in the sports of falconry, being used not only for partridge and pheasant, but also larger fowl, as geese and cranes, and sometimes for rabbits.\n\nGentil falcon.—Cere and feet yellow; body ash-coloured, with brown spots; tail with four blackish bands; somewhat larger than the preceding, though some ornithologists reckon it only a variety. It inhabits the Alps of Europe and North America. \"In the days of falconry,\" observes the author of Elements of Natural History, \"this species was in high esteem as a bold and spirited bird. It inhabits the north of Scotland. The king's falconer was anciently obliged to supply the court with hawks; and to this day the office is kept up in...\"\nAccipitres in Scotland; a nest of young birds being annually presented by the falconer to the barons of exchequer, who generally give them away in presents.\"\n\nPeregrine falcon.—Cere and feet yellow; body ash-coloured above with brownish hands, reddish white beneath, with blackish bands; tail spotted with white. Weighs between two and three pounds, is a bold and powerful bird, and inhabits Europe, and the north of Asia and America. It is not uncommon on most of our rocky coasts, usually frequenting such high cliffs as the guillemot and razorbill resort to for breeding. One that eloped from its master in the county of Forfar, on the 24th September 1772, with four heavy bells on its feet, was killed on the morning of the 26th of the same month, at Mosfyn in Flintshire.\n\nSpotted falcon.—Cere yellow; head and body above, white, with pale reddish spots, white beneath; breast a little spotted with ferruginous. Size of the buzzard. Inhabits England; but its history is little known.\n\nGray falcon.—Cere and legs yellow; body dusky gray above, white, with oblong black spots beneath; tail feathers long, the two middle ones uniform, the rest spotted. Bill blueish; irides red; head dusky brown before, white behind; sides and chin buff; quill-feathers spotted with white. Inhabits England; but is very rare, and by some esteemed only a variety.\n\nJer-falcon, gyrfalcon, Iceland falcon, white jer-falcon, &c.—Cere and feet of a greenish ash-colour; body white, spotted with brown. Bill blueish-ash, black at the tip; claws lead colour. Larger than the goshawk, and subject to variety, from age, sex, and climate, some in the northern latitudes being found quite white, others brown above, white beneath, spotted with brown, and the tail gray, with transverse brown lines. Inhabits Iceland and the north of Scotland, is a very bold bird, and in the days of falconry, was used for the larger species of game, as cranes and herons.\n\nLaughing falcon.—Cere and legs yellow; eyebrows white; body varied with brown and whitish; crown white, with a black ring. Back, wings, and rump brown; neck, chin, breast, belly, and under parts of the wings white; tail with yellow and black bands. Inhabits South America, and is said to laugh, when looked at.\n\nLanner.—Cere dull yellow; bill and feet blue; body marked with black longitudinal spots underneath. A white stripe over each eye; breast yellowish white, with brown spots; legs short; primary quill feathers and tail dusky, with rusty oval spots; but there are two or three varieties. Rather less than the buzzard, has its name from tearing its prey into small pieces with its bill. The lanner is very bold, and was formerly used in falconry. It is found in many parts of Europe; inhabits Iceland and the Ferroe isles, Denmark, Sweden, and the Tartarian deserts. It is rare in England, but is said to breed in Ireland, and among the low trees and shrubs in the deserts about Attracon.\n\nHen-harrier.—Cere white; legs tawny; body hoary blue; edges of the eye-lids yellow, with an arched line surrounding the throat; bill black; irides yellow; hind part of the head white, with pale brown spots; breast and belly white, the former streaked with dusky; two middle tail-feathers gray on both sides, the rest gray above, white beneath, and all streaked with dusky. These characters, however, are far from constant.\n\nThis species, in its most perfect state, weighs about thirteen ounces, and is eighteen inches and a half in length. It feeds on birds, lizards, and other reptiles, and is particularly destructive to poultry. It flies low, fishing along the surface in quest of prey. The female nests on the ground, and lays four eggs of a reddish colour, with a few white spots. Inhabits Europe and Africa. Wallis, in his Natural History of Northumberland, remarks, that it breeds annually on the Cheviot hills, and on the thady precipices under the Roman wall, near Craglake. Dr Latham and other eminent ornithologists have supposed, that this and the following are male and female; but the repeated instances of hen-harriers of both sexes having been seen, leave it beyond all doubt that they constitute two distinct species.\n\nRing-tail, ring-tail hawk, white-rumped bay falcon, Pogonias, &c.—Cere and legs yellow; body cinereous; belly pale, with oblong rufous spots; orbits of the eyes white. Bill pale; irides yellow; tail longish, banded with dusky, and dotted with white, the male marked with tranverse, and the female with longitudinal, spots beneath. Length 18 or 20 inches. Inhabits Europe, and the temperate parts of Siberia. Flies higher than the preceding, and sometimes perches on trees. Its eggs are white, much freckled with red.\n\nKefiril, kefiril, stonegall, &c.—Cere and legs yellow; back purplish-red, with black spots; breast with tufted brown streaks; tail rounded. Crown of the head of a fine cinereous gray; greater quill-feathers black, very slightly tipped with whitish. Bill lead colour, irides dusky and large. The male weighs about seven ounces, and measures 13 inches in length. The female is considerably larger, and distinguished from the other sex by the head and tail being of the same colour as the back, which is not so bright a red brown as the male. Feeds principally on mice, in search of which it is frequently seen hovering in the air and stationary for a great length of time. Preys also on small birds and insects, and was formerly used for catching game. Inhabits Europe, Siberia, and the more temperate parts of North America. One of our most common birds of prey, especially among the rocks and cliffs of the coast, which favour its breeding. The nest is of sticks, and lined with wool and other soft materials; but it sometimes builds on trees, or is contented with the deserted nest of a magpie or crow. The eggs are usually four or five, of a dirty white, blotched with rust colour, of various shades.—It is a handsome bird, whose flight is acute, and whose flight is easy and graceful. It includes two or three varieties.\n\nFishing falcon.—Legs brown; head ferruginous, with Picaeus; long feathers; body cinereous above, pale yellowish white beneath; tail pale brown above, blueish-ash beneath. Bill and irides yellow; margin of the upper feathers rusty brown, the under spotted in the middle with brown. Inhabits Senegal, where it is called tanas, preying chiefly on fish, which it takes out of the water, and retires to a convenient place to eat them piecemeal.\n\nSparrow-hawk.—Cere green; feet yellow; belly Nifus white, waved with gray; tail with black bands. The weight of the male of this species is about five ounces, that of the female nine; the former measures in length about 12 inches, the latter 15. The male is inclined to rust colour on the breast, the female to whitish. On the back of the head, in both sexes, is an obscure broken patch of white. The quill feathers are dusky, barred...\nAccipitres. red with black on the outer webs, and spotted with white at the base of the inner. The legs are long, slender, and yellow. In some the back is spotted with white, and others have the body entirely of that colour. The sparrow-hawk is very common in our wooded and inclosed districts, but is less frequent in the more champaign parts. The female sometimes builds her nest in hollow trees, high rocks, or lofty ruins, but more frequently takes possession of that which has been deserted by a crow, laying four or five eggs, of a dirty white or blueish tinge, blotched at one end with rusty colour. It is very widely diffused over the world, from Russia to the Cape of Good Hope. It is bold and spirited, making great destruction among pigeons, young poultry, and small birds of all kinds, which it will attack and carry off in the most daring manner; at the same time, that it is obedient and docile, and can be easily trained to hunt partridges, quails, larks, &c.\n\nHobby.—Cere and feet yellow; back brown; neck white; belly pale, with oblong brown spots. Bill blue; orbits yellow; irides generally chestnut; lateral tail-feathers with blackish bars; primary quill-feathers with oval reddish spots; claws black. The male weighs about seven ounces, and the female nine, or more. Inhabits Europe and Siberia, breeds in Britain, but leaves us the latter end of October. It builds in trees, and sometimes takes possession of a deserted crow's nest, laying three or four eggs, which are said to be white. Though small, it is inferior to none of the falcon tribe in courage, and will frequently pounce a partridge; but its favourite prey is the lark, which it terrifies to such a degree, that it sometimes flies to man for protection, and will allow a net to be thrown over it.\n\nMerlin.—Cere and feet yellow; head rusty; body above, of a blueish ash, with spots and rusty streaks; beneath, yellowish-white, with oblong spots. Bill blueish; irides dusky; tail alternately streaked with dusky and reddish; claws black; eggs brown red. There are several varieties. The merlin is a small species of falcon, being scarcely larger than the black-bird, but is very rapid on wing, and was esteemed for its courage in hawking. It flies low, and is generally seen skimming along the side of a hedge, or over the surface of the ground, in pursuit of small birds. Inhabits Europe; visits the south of England in October, about the time the hobby retires, but has never been observed to breed farther south than Cumberland, where it has been found more than once, with four young ones, placed on the ground.\n\nMinute Falcon.—Cere brown; legs yellow; body white beneath; tail-feathers brown, banded with black. About 11 inches long. Inhabits Malta; and occurs, though rarely, in England.\n\nTiny Falcon.—Legs yellow; body brown-ash; beneath whitish, with blackish bars; crown whitish. Hardly six inches long. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\nGen. 3. Strix, Owl.\n\nCharacters. Bill hooked; no cere; nostrils oblong, covered with bristly recumbent feathers; head, eyes, and ears large; tongue bifid.\n\nThese are nocturnal birds, with the organs of vision so constructed as to see in the dark. Their sense of hearing is very acute, by means of a particular membrane at the opening of the external ear. They can move the outermost toe either backwards or forwards. Accipitres. They feed on carrion, living small birds, hares, mice, field-mice, lizards, &c. When they venture abroad in daylight, they are chased, and infatuated by smaller birds, especially by the crow. In their manner of life, round head, &c., they have some affinity to cats. During the winter, they live retired, fasting, or sleeping in towers and old walls.\n\nA. Eared.\n\nGreat owl, great eared owl, great horned owl, &c.—Bubo. Body of a reddish, or tawny colour; irides yellow; head and body variegated with black, brown, ash, and rusty spots and lines; claws large, much hooked, and dusky. Liable to considerable varieties. Nearly the size of an eagle, and very strong, preying on hares, rabbits, moles, rats, mice, and sometimes bats and reptiles. It inhabits Europe, Calmuc Tartary, and South America, haunting mountainous rocks and caverns. Its nest is nearly three feet in diameter, and composed of sticks bound together by fibrous roots, and lined with leaves. It generally lays two eggs, somewhat larger than those of a hen, and variegated, like the bird itself. The young are very voracious, and are plentifully supplied with food by the parents. This bird is by no means common in Great Britain, though it has been occasionally shot both in England and Scotland. It endures day light better than most of the genus, flies low in the day, but sometimes soars very high during the night.\n\nVirginian eagle owl.—Size of the common eagle owl; Virginiana. Ear feathers large, rife above the base of the bill which is black; irides golden yellow; upper part of the body CCXCIII. brown, variegated with flender rufous and cinereous lines; under part pale-ash, transversely striped with brown; throat white; lower part of the neck and sides of the breast orange brown, spotted with darker brown; quills and tail banded with brown; legs and half the toes covered with cinereous feathers; claws horn colour. Inhabits America, Kamtchatka, and Africa. Is a little smaller than the great horned owl, and is supposed by some to be only a variety.\n\nCeylonese eagle owl.—Bill horn colour; irides yellow; Zeylonen upper part of the body pale reddish brown, under part CCXCIII. yellowish white; ears short, pointed; first quills and tail barred with black, white, and pale red; legs naked to the knees. Length 23 inches; weight two pounds and Fig. 3 near 10 ounces. Native of Ceylon.\n\nLong-eared or horn owl.—Ears with six feathers. Ears Otus. black and yellow; irides yellow; back and wing coverts dusky brown, gray, and yellowish-rusty; breast and belly pale yellow, with brown longitudinal lines; tail barred with ash-colour, and dusky; legs and feet feathered to the claws. About 14 inches long; but there is a variety that is much smaller, and another which is distinguished by the greater darkness of the body. Diffused over the four quarters of the globe, frequenting forests and wooded tracts, and manifesting a partiality to fir, box, or holly plantations, where it more readily conceals itself by day among the ever-green foliage. Its principal food is mice, and sometimes small birds taken at roost. It remains with us the whole year, and is frequently taken; yet little is known of its habits.\n\nShort-eared owl, hawk owl, mouse hawk, &c.—Brachypterus. Ears short; body above brown, feathers-edged with yellow; beneath pale yellow, with longitudinal dusky streaks.\nAccipitres streaks; head small and hawk-like; bill dusky; irides yellow. Length 14 inches; stretch of wing three feet. Inhabits Europe, Siberia, and America, chiefly in mountainous or wooded countries, and feeds principally on field-mice. Visits England in the latter part of the year, and disappears in spring. It flies by day, and is sometimes observed in companies. It is supposed to breed in the Orkneys, and probably in Norway, making its nest of dry grass, on the ground, and laying three or four white eggs.\n\nLittle horned owl.—Ears of one feather each. Gray, rufous, brown or blackish, according to age; legs spotted with brown; toes and claws brown. Between seven and eight inches long. Inhabits Europe, and preys on field mice.\n\nB. Earlefs.\n\nSnowy, or great white owl.—Body whitish, with a few brown lunated spots. Bill black, and almost hid in the feathers; irides yellow; legs covered with white feathers to the toes; claws black. This species is sometimes quite white, and sometimes varies with very numerous spots. About two feet long; flies abroad by day; preys on herons, hares, mice, and sometimes carrion, but is particularly fond of ptarmigans. Makes a howling noise. Inhabits the northern parts of Europe and America, particularly Sweden, Iceland, and Hudson's Bay, and sometimes, though rarely, Pennsylvania.\n\nGray or barred owl.—Head, neck, breast, back, and wing-coverts brown, spotted with white; belly and vent dirty white, streaked with brown; tail with brown and whitish bands, tipped with whitish. Weighs about three pounds, is two feet long, and four in extent of wing. Feeds on hares, mice, and cranes. Inhabits Hudson's Bay and New York, and rarely occurs in England.\n\nWhite or common owl.—Body pale yellow, with white spots; beneath whitish, with black spots. Bill white; irides dusky; tail-feathers white within, with dusky lines on the outside; 14 inches long, and weighs about 11 ounces. This species is so well known, that we need not more minutely describe it. It inhabits Europe, America, and Northern Asia, and is by far the most common of British owls, being distinguished by various provincial appellations, as barn owl, gillyhowlet, howlet, madge-howlet, church owl, hissing owl, screech owl, &c. It is partial to the habitations of man, and is rarely found in woods. Its ordinary haunts are barns, churches, old houses, and other uninhabited buildings, in which it continues during the day, but which it leaves in the evening, in quest of prey. Its flight is accompanied with loud and frightful cries, and its repose with a blowing noise, like the snoring of a man; when alarmed, it snaps its bill with great force. It makes scarcely any nest, but deposits five or six whitish eggs in the holes of walls. It feeds on mice, and small birds, which it swallows whole, and afterwards discharges the bones, feathers, and other indigestible parts, at its mouth, in the form of small round cakes, which are called coo-ings, and some buffets of which are sometimes found in the hollows of decayed trees, near farm-houses or villages, in barns, out-houses, &c. When a pair have young ones, they fall out alternately in quest of food for them, and generally return every five minutes, with a live mouse. Dr Latham mentions, that he received a specimen from Jamaica, which differed in no respect from our common owl.—The white owl is very susceptible of domestication, when taken young.\n\nTawny or brown owl, common brown or ivy owl, Strixula. black owl, howlet, wood owl, &c.—Body ash-coloured, the third flag-feather the longest; plumage marked above with dusky spots and points; breast and belly yellowish, mixed with white; beneath with dusky streaks; irides dusky; tail with pale brown and black spots and lines. Fourteen inches long; stretch of wing two feet eight inches; weight of the female 19 ounces. Inhabits Europe and Tartary. This is another very common species. It resides chiefly in woods and plantations of fir; concealing itself in the thickest recesses; sometimes it settles on the ground, but if molested, takes shelter in a neighbouring tree. It is rarely seen on wing by day, except forced from its haunts, the light dazzling it to such a degree that boys hunt it down with sticks and stones. It breeds in the hollows of trees, and sometimes in barns, where it is protected by the farmer, as it is an excellent mouser. It lays two or three eggs of a roundish form, and dull white colour. It is the only species known to hoot, besides which, it makes a disagreeable screaming noise. It is a great enemy to young pigeons, leverets, young rats, &c. but chiefly subsists on mice.—\"We have taken this bird,\" says Mr Montagu, \"in its mature state, as well as young, and found no difficulty in either case of preserving them alive. They were never observed to drink; and indeed for many months together had no water offered them.\"—The ulula of Linnaeus is now esteemed only a smaller variety of the strixula.\n\nLittle owl.—With white spots arranged in five rows on the flag-feathers; bill whitish brown; irides pale yellow; head, back, and wing coverts pale brown, with white spots; breast whitish, variegated with rusty. Scarcely larger than a blackbird, but varies considerably both in respect of size and markings. Inhabits Europe, North America, and the West Indies. Is very rare in England, though it has sometimes been found in Yorkshire, Flinthire, and the neighbourhood of London. It is said to frequent ruined edifices in France, and to build in chimneys, in Carniola: but it frequently nests in the holes of rocks and walls, and lays five or six eggs, spotted with yellowish and white. It can fly by day, and give chase to swallows and other small birds on wing, but mice are its principal food.\n\nWhite-fronted owl.—Body rusty brown, paler beneath; forehead white; quill feathers barred with black and white. Only five inches long. Native of North America.\n\nGen. 4. Lanius, Shrike.\n\nBill nearly straight, with a dent on each mandible, near the end, naked at the base; tongue jagged at the point.\n\nThe birds of this genus form a connecting link between the falcons and pies, and have been differently classified by different ornithologists. Though comparatively small, they are very courageous, will attack birds much larger than themselves, and are called butcher birds, because they frequently kill several, before they begin to feed. They fix on their victims with their talons, split the skull with their bill, and then feed on them at leisure.\nCollared Shrike, canary biter or fiscal.—Tail wedged; body black, white beneath; first quill feathers white at the base; bill and head blackish; tail feathers, except the four middle ones, white at the tips. Very common at the Cape of Good Hope, also found in Senegal, and in the interior parts of Africa. Twelve inches long. Feeds on beetles, grasshoppers, and other insects, which it not only catches with great dexterity; but when it cannot consume them all, will stick them on the pales of farm yards, till it has occasion for them. It also seizes on sparrows and canary birds, of which it devours only the brains.\n\nCinerous Shrike, great cinereous shrike, greater butcher bird, mattocks, night jar, &c.—Tail somewhat cuneiform, white on the edges; back gray; wings black, with a white spot; bill black, with bristles at the base; upper parts of the plumage of a pale blue ash, the under parts white; legs black. The female differs chiefly in the under parts, which are of a dirty white, marked with numerous semicircular brown lines. There is a variety, with the body white, legs yellowish, and bill and claws blackish; and another with lesser wing coverts and reddish shoulders. Inhabits Europe and North America. Is rather a scarce bird in England, but is said to breed among some of our mountainous situations; coming in May, and departing in September. It makes a nest of heath and moss, lined with wool and gossamer, and lays six eggs, of a dull olive green, spotted with black at the larger end. According to Buffon, it is common in France, where it continues all the year; it kills rats, mice, and small birds, affixing its prey to a sharp thorn, and tearing it in pieces with its bill; it is also said to imitate the notes of some other birds, by way of decoying them to their destruction. Mr Pennant observes, that when kept in a cage, it sticks its food against the wires before it will eat it.\n\nRed-backed Shrike, lesser butcher-bird, or flutier.—Tail somewhat wedged; back hoary; four innermost tail-feathers of one colour; bill of a leaden hue. Irides hazel; head and lower part of the back of a light gray, upper part of the back and wing-coverts of a bright rusty red; breast, belly, and sides of a fine pale roe, or bloom colour; a black streak passes from the bill through the eyes; legs black. Length about seven inches; weight eight drams. The female weighs two drams more, and has all the upper parts of a ferruginous brown. The manners of this species are similar to those of the last. It kills small birds by piercing the skull with its bill, and infests by transfixing them on the thorn of the sloe-bush. It tears off the body of the chaffinch, and leaves the elytra, wings, and head behind. It imitates the song of many of the sparrow tribe, and thus entices them within its reach. It chiefly haunts inclosed moist situations, makes its nest in some thick hedge, composing it very skilfully of moss and fibrous roots put together with wool and lined with hair, and lays five or six eggs of a bluish-white colour, with a circle of brown near the broad end. It inhabits Europe and Africa, visits Britain in May, and departs to some warmer climate in September. Among its varieties Gmelin includes lanius rufulus of Latham, or woodchat, which is very rare in this country.\n\nTyrant Shrike.—Body cinereous, white beneath; crown of the head black, with a longitudinal tawny streak. Eight inches long. There are several varieties, all natives of America and the West Indies, and all of a fierce and audacious disposition, fixing on the backs of other predatory birds, and making a continual chattering noise, till they force them to retire.\n\nORDER II. PICÆ.\n\nThe distinguishing marks of this order are, a bill some-what compressed, more or less crooked, and always convex; toes divided, and adapted either for climbing (canorial) or, for flepping, (gregorial). Some feed on insects, worms, and the flesh and offal of other animals, and some on the seeds and juices of plants. During the breeding season, they are monogamous, and make their nests on trees; and during incubation, the female is often fed by the male. There are a few genera, however, which do not exactly correspond with these characters.\n\nGen. 5. Psittacus, Parrot.\n\nBill hooked; upper mandible moveable, and, for the most part covered with a cape; nostrils rounded, and placed in the base of the bill, tongue fleshy, obtuse, entire; feet canorial.\n\nThis very numerous genus, which contains upwards of 140 species, is peculiar to the warmer regions of both worlds. The birds which belong to it, resemble the accipitres in the form of the bill, but in their manners coincide with the other genera of this order. They feed on the seeds and fruits of various plants; are very docile, and by means of their obtuse tongue, may be taught to imitate human speech. They climb easily, afflicting themselves with their bill. They associate in pairs, and attain to a great age. Some species equal the domestic fowl in size, while others are no larger than a sparrow. In Europe, they sometimes lay eggs, but seldom sit on them. In their native climates, the male and female sit on them alternately.\n\nA. Tail long, and wedge-shaped.\n\nRed and blue Macaw.—Quill-feathers blue above, Macao, rufous beneath, scapulars varied with blue and green; cheek naked, wrinkled. Body leaden; upper mandible white, lower black; temples white; wing-coverts generally yellow; tail long and red; feathers blue at the tips. Two feet seven inches in length, size of a capon. Inhabits Brazil, Guiana, and other regions of South America, afflicting moor, palm woods, and living on the fruit of the trees. When driven by hunger to feed on the manchineel apple, its flesh is poisonous, though the bird itself receives no injury. Makes its nest in decayed trees, enlarging the hole, if necessary, with its bill, and lining the inside with feathers. The female lays two eggs at a time, about the size of those of a pigeon, and spotted like those of a partridge. Breeds twice a year, the male and female sitting on the nest alternately, and reciprocally nursing and feeding the young birds. The latter are tamed with great ease, and may even be taught to speak, but the old birds are clamorous and unmanageable. Though the flesh is hard, black, and unsavoury, it makes good soup, and furnishes a great part of the food of the inhabitants of Cayenne, as well as other parts of South America. Like other parrots it is subject to fits when kept tame. The strength of its\nits bill is sufficient to break a peach-stone with great ease.\n\nRed and yellow macaw.—Pale scarlet; scapulars yellow, tipped with green; quill feathers blue above, rufous beneath; cheeks naked and wrinkled. Size of the preceding. Inhabits Guiana, Brazil, and Jamaica.\n\nTabuan parrot.—Head, neck, breast, and belly, purple; back and wing-coverts green; crown terminated by a lunular blue mark; first quill-feathers and greater part of the tail blue. Length, 19 inches. A beautiful species, found at Tonga Taboo, and the other Friendly Isles in the South seas. The green variety, with the head, neck, breast, and belly, scarlet; occurs in New South Wales.\n\nBeautiful parrot.—Head, neck, and body, red beneath, brown above; intercapulars pale blue, mixed with red; tail greenish-brown, tipped with white. Varies, with the wings, tail, and body green above. From 12 to 15 inches long. Inhabits the Molucca islands.\n\nPennantii parrot.—Scarlet; fore part of the back black, waved with scarlet; sides and throat blue; quill-feathers each with a white spot. There is a variety with a pale band in the middle of each wing. The female has the upper parts of the neck and body greenish, top of the head red, and a patch of the same colour under each eye; chin and throat blue; lower part of the neck and breast, as also the rump and vent, red; middle of the belly dusky green; tail dark blue, fringed with chestnut; shoulders blue, and the rest of the wing the same, but darker. Fifteen inches long. Inhabits New South Wales.\n\nSplendid parrot.—Bright blood-red; back feathers edged with black; chin, wings, and tail blue. Sixteen inches long. Inhabits New Holland.\n\nOrange-billed parrot, or long parakeet.—Of a yellowish green colour; the hind part of the head, the throat, and breast red; crown of the head and ears blue, with ash-coloured orbits. Eight inches long. Inhabits India. Like other small species with long tails, is not easily taught to speak.\n\nGray-breasted parakeet.—Olive; face, chin, and breast mouse-colour, quill-feathers green. Bill and legs gray; tail five inches long. About the size of a thrush. Tame and gentle, and easily taught to articulate. Common at Monte Video.\n\nHorned parrot.—Green; head scarlet, with two long feathers standing out like horns; collar and rump straw-colour; outer edge of the quill and tail feathers blue. Bill and legs black blue; temples orange; irides golden; wing-coverts at the tips, and within dusky; tail black beneath. Length 11 inches, size of a small dove. Inhabits New Caledonia. Figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\nGround parrot, New Wales parrot, or black-spotted parakeet of Van Diemen's Land. Green; four middle tail-feathers barred with green and black, the rest with black and yellow; bill and legs black; tail much wedged. This is a most elegant and beautiful species, about 12 inches long, inhabiting New South Wales, and other parts of New Holland, where it is known by the name of goolgingang. It is rarely seen, except on the ground, particularly in moist places. It is not known to perch on trees like other parrots, but rises from among the grass, and immediately alights in it again. The legs and toes are more slender than usual in this genus, and the claws more straight.\n\nOtahete parakeet.—Blue; feathers of the head long; chin and throat white; bill and legs red. Tongue fringed at the end; only five inches long; inhabits Otahete, and feeds on the fruit of the banana.\n\nB. Tails short, and even at the ends.\n\nBankiian cockatoo.—Splendid black; crest small; head Bankiian; and wing-coverts dotted with buff; outer tail-feathers scarlet in the middle, barred and tipped with black. Nearly three feet long, but varies both in size and markings. Inhabits New Holland, and was brought to England by Sir Joseph Banks. Figured in Latham's first Supplement.\n\nGreat white cockatoo, or yellow-crested cockatoo.—Cirratus. White; crest folding, and yellow. Bill, cere, irides, legs and claws black; orbits naked and white; quill and lateral tail feathers, from the base to the middle fulphureous on the inside; feathers of the neck loofly flowing; crest five inches long, and erectile. Length 18 inches; size of a domestic ordinary fowl. This, and several other species frequently repeat the word cockatoo. Inhabits the Molucca islands.\n\nAsh-coloured or hoary parrot.—Bluish-gray; temples Erythacus, naked and white; tail scarlet. Bill black; cere white; irides yellowish white; legs cinereous; claws black. Subject to several varieties. About 20 inches long. Loquacious, and easily taught to speak. Inhabits Africa, and is sometimes called jaco from the sound which it commonly utters.\n\nCeram or purple parrot, Ceram lory, &c.—Red; orbits ash-coloured; cheeks and wings green; hinder parts of the tail-feathers blue. There are three or four varieties. Size of a dove. Inhabits Ceram, and the other Molucca islands.\n\nPurple or blue-cap lory.—Red; cap violet; wings Domicella, green; shoulders and cheeks blue; orbits brown. There is a variety with a blue cap, black orbits, and yellow collar. According to some writers, these are male and female. They inhabit the East Indies, and are remarkable for speaking distinctly, and quickly learning their lesson. They are in general scarce, and fetch a high price.\n\nViolet cap, or black-capped lory.—Purple; cap violet; Lory, wings green; breast, cheeks, and tail blue; orbits pale flesh-colour. Upwards of 10 inches long; inhabits the Philippine isles, particularly Yolo. It is so familiar and playful, that it is much to be regretted that its duration of life proves so short in these colder regions.\n\nYellow winged parrot, or yellow-headed creatine.—Octroo. Green; front and orbits whitish; crown, cheeks, chin, throat, and remoter wing-coverts, yellow. Thirteen inches long. Inhabits South America. A friend of the Count de Buffon had one of this species alive, which seemed much attached to its master, and yet of a very capricious temper, expecting a return for every demonstration of civility. In its wantonness, it would sometimes bite a little too hard, and laugh heartily, as if pleased with the act; but if chastised for the offence, it became the more refractory, and could be reclaimed only by gentle treatment. It took great delight in tearing everything to pieces, was dull and silent if confined\nin its cage; but when at large, chattered almost incessantly, and repeated every thing that was said to it. It was also, contrary to the disposition of many parrots, very fond of children. During the moulting season, it appeared dejected and uneasy for nearly three successive months. It was for the most part fed on hemp-feed, nuts, fruits of all kinds, and bread soaked in wine, but preferred meat, if it could get it. It was observed, that if it fed on this last, it became dull and heavy, and soon lost its feathers. It was also remarked, that it kept its food for some time in its cheeks, whence it was gradually protruded by a sort of rumination.\n\nPaffervinus. Paffervine parrot, or blue and green parakeet.—Yellow-green, with a blue spot on the wings, which are blue below. Bill, cere, orbits, legs and claws, orange; primary wing-coverts blue. Inhabits Brazil and Guiana, and is the smallest of the genus, being only four inches in length, and of the size of the house sparrow.\n\nBlue-collared parrot.—Yellow-with-green, collar blue, rump red. Larger than a pigeon. Inhabits Chili, where it is called thecau, and where it often does much injury to the corn, flying in great flocks. When the troop settles, one of them acts as sentinel on a tree, and gives the alarm if any person approaches, from which circumstance it is difficult to shoot them. This species breeds in the holes of rocks, laying two white eggs in the most inaccessible and craggy parts. From the tops of the cliff, the inhabitants let themselves down by ropes to take the eggs and young birds, which are reckoned delicate eating. If robbed of its young, this parrot will lay a second, and even a third, but rarely a fourth time. It is easily tamed, and learns to speak well.\n\nWhite-breasted parrot.—Green, yellow beneath, cap black, breast white, orbits flesh-colour. Length nine inches and a half. Inhabits Mexico, Guiana, and the Caracas in South America. Frequent woods, and seldom approaches inhabited districts. Its call is a shrill whistle, which it often repeats in its flight, nor does it learn to talk. \"These birds, says Dr Latham, fly in small numbers together, but are perpetually quarrelling with one another; and, if any one is taken, it refuses all food, till at last it is starved to death. Parrots of the most stubborn nature are often subdued by means of the smoke of tobacco; but this bird is only put into bad humour by the attempt. Whoever, therefore, would have these parrots, must train them up young; and this would scarce be worth while were it not for the sake of variety.\" Buffon has observed that it is thicker and shorter-necked than most parrots, that its feathers are more stiffly set on, and that it is of a more dull and sluggish disposition.\n\nSenegal parrot.—Green, yellow beneath, head cinereous, orbits black and naked. Bill cinereous, cere blackish, irides yellow, legs reddish-ash. Size of a black-bird, length eight inches and a quarter. Plentiful in Senegal, where it flies in companies of five or six, and perches on the tops of the trees which are scattered in the sandy plains. Its cry is shrill and dissonant.\n\nEthiopian parrot, or red-headed Guinea parakeet.—Green, front red, tail tawny, with a black band, orbits cinereous. Size of a lark; length five inches and a half. Very common in Guinea, and also occurs in Ethiopia, the East Indies, and the island of Java.\n\nSapphire parrot, or sapphire-crowned parakeet.—Green; rump and breast scarlet, crown (of the male) blue. It sometimes occurs with the head yellowish-blue, a transverse orange bar behind, and the front and under part of the throat and tail-coverts red. Five inches long. Inhabits the Philippine islands. Sleeps suspended by one foot, and is very fond of the fresh juice of the cocoa-nut tree. \"If this is put in a cage, says Obeck, it whistles very seldom, and commonly grows quite sulken; it hangs itself with its feet so, that the back is turned towards the earth, and seldom changes this situation: it is fed with boiled rice; in which manner in the year 1752, one was brought to Gottenburg.—We observed that their nests were remarkable for their exceeding fine texture; but we did not see the birds. If they had a different construction, the monkeys would be very mischievous to them; but now, before they can get to the opening, the lowest part, as the weakest, breaks in pieces, and the visitor falls to the ground without any danger to the birds.\"\n\nGen. 6. Ramphastos, Toucan.\n\nBill large, hollow, convex, and serrated at the margins; both mandibles incurvated at the tips; nostrils behind the base of the bill, long and narrow; tongue feathered at the edges; feet mostly fan-shaped.\n\nThe birds of this genus seem to be limited to the tropical regions of South America, and are very impatient of cold. They feed on fruit, especially that of the palm trees. They are generally met with in small flocks of eight or ten, moving from place to place in quest of food, and advancing northward or southward as the fruits ripen, though they are not properly migratory. They make their nests in the hollows of trees abandoned by the woodpeckers, and not formed by themselves, the structure of their bill not allowing of the efforts necessary to make, or even enlarge a hole in the most tender wood, as it yields to the least pressure of the finger. They lay two eggs, and probably breed more than once in the year, as they are pretty numerous. If brought up young they are easily tamed, and become very familiar.\n\nGreen toucan.—Green, belly yellow, rump red. Up-Vitellus, per mandible yellow, with red sides and a black line in the middle, the lower black; the base and space round the nostrils red, the teeth in both white, irides and orbits yellow, legs lead colour, claws black, tail wedged and inclining to ash beneath; head, chin, and throat in the male, black, in the female, bay, terminated by a black, narrow, transverse band. Fourteen inches long. Inhabits Cayenne. Its extraordinary large bill gives it a very singular appearance.\n\nPavonina toucan.—Green, feathers sprinkled with red Pavoninus, spots. Bill variegated with yellow and black, legs and claws black. Seventeen inches long. Inhabits the leafcoats of New Spain, and is said to feed on fish. This last circumstance, however, may admit of doubt. Most of the species will eat fish, and even flesh, in a state of confinement; but their frequent proximity to the water in their natural state, is probably occasioned by the situation of their favourite fruit.\n\nBrazilian toucan, or Brazilian pie.—Blackish, abdominal Pileivora, band and vent red, rump white. Twenty-one inches long.\nPicæ. Long; Inhabits South America. The propriety of its Linnaean designation is somewhat doubtful.\n\nTucanæ. Yellow-breasted toucan.—Blackish; abdominal band, vent, and rump yellow. Nineteen inches long. Inhabits South America.\n\nAlbius. White toucan.—Entirely white. No other particulars are known of this species.\n\nMomotus. Gen. 7. Momotus, Motmot.\n\nCharacters. Bill strong, slightly curved, ferrated at the edges; nostrils feathered, tongue feathered, tail wedged, feet gressiflorial.\n\nBraflienfis. Brazilian motmot, or Brazilian saw-billed roller.—Plate CCCXCV. Fig. 4. Green, front bluish-green, hind part of the head violet, crown black. Variegated with green, tawny, blue and cinereous. Body olive-green above, rusty beneath; head large, bill black, legs black, claws hooked. About a foot and a half in length, and nearly equal to a magpie in size. Inhabits Brazil, Cayenne, Mexico, and other parts of South America. It is a solitary bird, frequenting thick forests; chiefly seen on the ground, or on some low branch of a tree, taking short flights when disturbed, and pronouncing the word honiou. It makes a nest of dry grass and stalks on the ground, frequently in some hole deserted by an armadillo or other quadruped, and laying for the most part two eggs. It feeds on insects and raw flesh, the fragments of which it macerates in water. When taken, it strikes violently with its bill. Its voice is extremely harsh, weak, and tremulous.\n\nGen. 8. Scythrops, Channel-bill.\n\nBill large, convex, cultrated, furrowed or channelled on the sides, with the tip bent; nostrils round, naked, placed at the base of the bill; tongue cartilaginous and bifid at the end; toes placed two before and two behind; tail consisting of ten feathers.\n\nPfitteceus. New Holland channel-bill, pfitteaceous or anomalous horn-bill.—Bill pale brown, tipped with yellowish, convex, keeled; nostrils surrounded with a red wrinkled skin; orbits naked; head, neck, and under parts of the body pale bluish-gray; back, wings, and tail cinereous, the feathers mostly with dusky blackish tips; tail long, wedged, its feathers barred with black near the end, and tipped with white; legs short, scaly, and with the hooked claws black. Size nearly that of a crow, and the total length 27 inches. Inhabits New Holland, though not plentifully, and is seldom seen unless in the morning and evening, sometimes in small groups of eight or ten, but frequently in pairs, appearing about Port Jackson in October, and departing in January, but to what country is not known. Both on the wing, and when perched, they make a strange, loud, screaming noise, not unlike that of the common cock and hen when they perceive a hawk or other bird of prey hovering over them. They are supposed to feed principally on the seeds of the red gum and peppermint trees, which they swallow whole. The tail is sometimes displayed like a fan, which gives the bird a majestic appearance.\n\nGen. 9. Buceros, Horn-bill.\n\nBill convex, curved, sharp-edged, large, ferrated at the margins, with a horny protuberance on the upper mandible near the base; nostrils behind the base of the bill; tongue short, sharp-pointed; feet gressiflorial.\n\nThe birds of this genus are all inhabitants of the warmer regions of Asia and Africa, and seem to correspond to the toucans of the New World. According to Latham, the circumstance of their feeding on fish requires confirmation.\n\nPhilippine horn-bill.—Front bony, flat, and two-horned at the fore part. Varies with a vermilion bill, black belly, and the back and rump brown ash. Body black above, white beneath; quill-feathers with a white spot; tail long and black; legs greenish. Size of a common fowl; inhabits the Philippine islands, and has a cry like the grunting of a hog. It lives in the woods, and feeds on fruits, such as the Indian fig, pittachio, &c., which it swallows entire; and after digesting the pulp, brings up the stones whole, and still fit for vegetation. The Gentoos rank it among their gods.\n\nAbyssinian horn-bill.—Black; bony protuberance semicircular on the fore part; orbits, chin, and part of the throat naked, and irides brown. Greater quill feathers white. Total length, three feet ten inches; extent of wing, six feet. On the neck are several protuberances, as in the turkey cock, of a light blue colour, changing to red on various occasions. Occurs in Abyssinia, generally among the fields of taff, feeding on green beetles, which frequent that plant. It has a putrid smell, which has occasioned a supposition of its feeding on carrion. It has been seen with eighteen young ones, and usually runs on the ground; but when raised, flies both strong and far. It builds in large thick trees, and when it can, near churches; has a covered nest, like that of a magpie, but four times as large as an eagle's, placed firm on the trunk, at no great height from the ground, and the entry always on the east side.\n\nIndian horn-bill.—Protuberance flattened forwards, Hydrobelly tawny, neck with a white collar. Two feet four inches long, rather bigger than a cock. Inhabits the Moluccas, and feeds chiefly on nutmegs, from which circumstance its flesh is very delicate, and has a fine aromatic flavour. In its native places, it is frequently tamed for the purpose of destroying rats and mice.\n\nRhinoceros horn-bill, rhinoceros-bird, or horned Indian raven.—The horny protuberance on the upper mandible recurved. Inhabits India. Three feet long, and nearly as big as a turkey. Feeds on flesh and carrion, and follows the hunters for the purpose of feeding on the entrails of the beasts which they kill. It is also said to feed on rats and mice, and after preening them flat with its bill, to toss them up in the air, and swallow them whole, immediately on their descent.\n\nPanayan horn-bill.—Greenish black; under part of the body dusky red; the prominence of the upper mandible acute above and plane at the sides; bill very long, arched, dusky, having the sides marked transversely with orange-coloured furrows. Size of the raven. Native of the isle of Panay.\nGen. 10. Buphaga, Beef-eater.\n\nBuphaga. Bill straight, squarish; mandibles gibbous, entire, more gibbous at the margins; feet gregarious.\n\nAfrican beef-eater.—Upper parts of the body gray-brown, under parts and rump yellowish; bill hardly an inch long; sometimes yellowish, tipped with red, sometimes black; tail wedged; legs and claws black. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits Senegal, and other districts of Africa. Resembles the starling, in its manners, appearing in small troops of a dozen or more. Alights on the backs of oxen, antelopes, and other quadrupeds, and by preying the elevated part of the animal's hide, which contains the larva of the coirrus, forces it out, and regales on it. Is also said to feed on various kinds of insects. It has a shrill kind of cry, in no respect approaching to a song.\n\nGen. 11. Crotophaga, Ani.\n\nBill compressed, semi-oval, arched, carinate on the back; upper mandible angular at each edge; nostrils pervious, or going from one side of the bill to the other.\n\nLesser ani.—Blackish-violet; feet scaly. Body black; tail long, and wedged; upper mandible incurved at the tip; nostrils oval; tongue flecky, and entire; legs black. Length thirteen inches and a half; size of a blackbird; and sometimes known by the names of the razor-billed blackbird, or great blackbird. Inhabits South America and several of the West India islands. This species is gregarious to such a degree, that many females lay their eggs in the same nest, to make which they all unite in concert, and after depositing their eggs, fit on them close to each other, in order to hatch them, each striving to do the most for the general good. When the young are hatched, the parents exert themselves to feed the whole flock. It is still more remarkable, that as soon as the female has laid her eggs, she covers them with leaves, and repeats this operation as often as she is obliged to leave the nest for food. It generally breeds twice a year; and the eggs are about the size of those of a pigeon, of a fawn-green colour, and spotted at the ends. The lesser ani feeds on worms, insects, fruits, and grain, according to the season. The other species resemble this in appearance and manners, but vary somewhat in size and colouring.\n\nGen. 12. Musophaga, Plantain-eater.\n\nBill strong, triangular, the upper mandible at the base elevated above the crown, both mandibles dentated on edges; nostrils in the middle of the bill; tongue entire and stout; toes placed three before and one behind.\n\nViolet plantain-eater.—Bill one inch and a half; the upper mandible nearly triangular, losing its attachment at the back part, and hanging over the crown; colour of the bill yellow, and reddish towards the end; irides brown; top of the head purple; neck, breast, body, and wings violet; legs dusky-black, and very strong. This beautiful and rare bird is found on plains near the borders of rivers, in the province of Acra, in Guinea, and is said to live principally on the fruit of the plantain. Its total length is nineteen inches, of which the tail is five inches and one third. It is described and figured in Latham's second Supplement.\n\nGen. 13. Glaucomis, Wattle-bird.\n\nBill incurvated, arched, the lower mandible florent, with a caruncle below at the base; nostrils depressed, characters, and half covered with a membrane nearly cartilaginous, cut at the point, and fringed; feet gregarious.\n\nCinerous wattle-bird.—Body, bill, and legs black; caruncle first blue, then orange; irides blue, and very large; tail long and wedged; legs long; hind claws longer than the rest. Fifteen inches long; about the size of a jay. Inhabits New Zealand, where it is often seen walking on the ground, and sometimes, though more rarely, perching on trees. It feeds on various kinds of berries and insects, and even, according to some, on small birds. Its note approaches to whistling, and sometimes to a sort of murmuring that is not unpleasant. Its flesh is eatable, and by some esteemed savoury.\n\nGen. 14. Corvus, Crow.\n\nBill strong, upper mandible a little convex, edges cul-trated, and in most species, slightly notched near the tip; nostrils covered with bristles reflected over them; tongue divided at the end; toes, three forward, one backward, the middle one joined to the outer as far as the first joint.\n\nThe greater number of this tribe are found in every climate. They are prolific, social, and clamorous; building on trees; laying six eggs; and living on grain, seeds, insects, &c. Some of them are apparently hurtful to agriculture; but their use in diminishing noxious vermin more than counterbalances the waste which they occasion.\n\nRaven.—Black; back of a blueish black; tail nearly rounded. Two feet two inches long. Varies with a few scattered white feathers, or is black and white, or entirely white. A well-known bird, and native of Europe, Asia, and America. Is hardy, cunning, voracious, and yet patient of hunger. Preys on young ducks and chickens, and even destroys young lambs and sickly sheep, by first picking out their eyes. Smells carrion at a great distance; gluts itself when an opportunity offers, retires to digest, and returns again to feed. Though easily domesticated, and taught to speak, it has a mischievous trick of purloining anything glittering, and concealing it. \"We have been assured, (says Mr Montagu), by a gentleman of veracity, that his butler having missed a great many silver spoons and other articles, without being able to detect the thief for some time, at last observed a tame raven with one in his mouth, and watched him to his hiding-place, where he found more than a dozen.\" The raven usually makes choice of the forks of the largest trees to build in; but many of them likewise breed on rocky coasts, and nestle in the most inaccessible parts of them. At this time they are very bold, and will not allow even the falcon to approach their nest with impunity. The male and female pair for life, and drive their young from their haunt, as soon as they are able to provide for themselves. The female lays five or six eggs, of a blueish green.\nCarrion crow.—Blueish-black; tail rounded; tail feathers acute. Varied with spotings of white, or entirely white; bill black, irides dusky, legs black. Distinguished from the rook by the bill, which is rather more convex towards the end, and by the reflected brilliess at the base being always perfect. These marks, however, are obvious only in adults, and in young birds, the note is the only criterion, which in this is much more hoarse than that of the rock. This species weighs about nineteen ounces, and is eighteen inches long. It feeds on flesh, insects, and grain, but is particularly fond of carrion. It frequently attacks the eyes of dying animals, destroys weakly lambs, and when palled with hunger, will even pursue birds on wing. It likewise makes havoc among young game and poultry. It will frequently hide its food till hunger becomes more urgent. With the lesser species of hawks it wages constant war; nor will it suffer the kite, the buzzard, or the raven, to approach its nest with impunity. Carrion crows keep in pairs all the year, and seldom congregate but to regale on some carcass, or to roost in winter. They build in woods, on the branches of trees, making a nest of sticks, plastered with earth, and lined with some soft materials, as wool and hair. The eggs are four or five in number, of a greenish colour, spotted with dusky and ash.\n\nRook.—Black; fore-part of the head cinereous; tail somewhat rounded. Very like the preceding; but differs in its manners, being content with feeding on the insect tribe and grain. It is particularly fond of what is commonly called the grub-worm, which is the larva of the chaffier. The rook is gregarious at all seasons, retorting every spring to breed on the same trees, where their nests may be seen crowded, one over another, on the upper branches. It lays four or five eggs, much like those of the crow. After their young have taken wing, they all forsake their nest-trees, but return to them again in October, to roost. On the approach of winter, they usually seek some more sheltered situation at night, but generally assemble first in the usual place, and then fly off together. Rookeries are sometimes the scene of violent contests between the old and new inhabitants. An unfortunate couple of strangers will sometimes have their half-built nests torn in pieces, and be compelled to begin their work anew in some more undisturbed situation. \"Of this (says Mr Bewick) we had a remarkable instance in Newcastle. In the year 1783, a pair of rooks, after an unsuccessful attempt to establish themselves in a rookery at no great distance from the exchange, were compelled to abandon the attempt. They took refuge on the spire of that building, and although constantly interrupted by other rooks, built their nest on the top of the vane, and brought forth their young, undisturbed by the noise of the populace below them; the nest and its inhabitants turning about with every change of the wind. They returned and built their nest every year on the same place till 1793, soon after which the spire was taken down.\" In England, rooks remain during the whole year; but both in France and Silesia, they migrate. It is a singular circumstance, that the island of Jersey should be entirely without rooks; particularly when we know that they frequently fly over from Britain to France. The young birds, when skimmed, and made into pyes, are much in request at some tables, but are nevertheless coarse eating.\n\nHooded crow, or royston crow.—Ash-coloured; head, throat, wings, and tail black. Length twenty-one inches. Visits the south of England in October, and retires north to breed, in the beginning of April. In the Hebrides, and some parts of Scotland and Ireland, it is resident throughout the year. In open campaign districts, it feeds on grain, worms, and carrion; but it often resorts to the neighbourhood of the sea coast, where the various animal matters thrown up by the tide, afford a constant supply of food. It not only picks out the eyes of lambs and diseased sheep, but of horses, when entangled in hogs. The nest and eggs are similar to those of the common crow. It is not uncommon in many parts of Europe and Siberia.\n\nJackdaw.—Brownish black; hind part of the head hoary; front, wings, and tail, black. Its varieties are, a white collar round the neck; white, with a yellowish bill; bright black, and eyes surrounded with white-dots; black, with bill and legs red; wings white, bill somewhat curved; brownish, with white shoulders, &c. Weighs about nine ounces; length near thirteen inches. This very common bird frequents old towers, ruined buildings, and high cliffs, where it builds, as well as in holes of trees. The nest is made of sticks, and lined with wool and other soft materials; the eggs are five or six, and blueish, spotted with black. The jackdaw is gregarious, frequently flocks with rooks, and like the latter, feeds on grain and insects, is fond of cherries, and will devour carrion in severe weather. It is frequently seen to perch on the back of sheep, not only to rob that animal of its wool as a lining to its nest, but also to pick out the ticks with which it is infested. Though easily made tame, and taught to speak, it is mischievous, and full of tricks.\n\nJay.—Wing-coverts blue, with white and black transverse lines; body variegated with purple and gray. This beautiful bird is very common in Great Britain, and in various parts of Europe and Siberia; frequenting wooded tracts, but not in flocks. It weighs seven ounces, and measures nearly thirteen inches in length. The nest, which is commonly built in high coppice wood, or hedges, and sometimes against the side of a scrubby tree, is formed of sticks, lined with fibrous roots, and contains five or six eggs, of a light brown colour, not very unlike those of the partridge, but smaller, and obscurely marked with a darker shade of brown. The jay is a great devourer of fruit and grain, particularly acorns, peas, and cherries; will frequently plunder the nests of smaller birds of their eggs and young, and sometimes pounce on the old birds, on which it preys, as well as on mice. Its common notes are various, but harsh, and manifest a singular propensity to imitation and mimicry, counterfeiting the bleating of a lamb, the mewing of a cat, the cry of a kite or buzzard, the hooting of an owl, the neighing of a horse, &c. It has even been known to imitate very exactly the sound made by the action of a saw.\n\nBlue jay.—Blue; collar black; wing-coverts with transverse black lines; crest blue; cheeks, chin, and belly, white; breast pale red; back pale purple; tail long, wedged, with black and blue lines, and tipped with white; legs black. Eleven inches long; inhabits North\nNorth America; is gregarious; builds in marshy places; has a pleasant note; feeds on worms, serpents, chestnuts, &c., and is particularly destructive to the maize fields.\n\n**Nut-cracker.**—Brown, dotted with white; wings and tail black; tail feathers black at the tip, the middle ones as if worn. Body with triangular white spots; vent white; crown and tail-feathers without spots; feathers of the nostrils sometimes wanting; tongue bicuspidate. Length thirteen inches; size of a magpie. Inhabits Europe and Siberia, but is very rare in England. Its favorite food seems to be the kernels of nuts, which it hacks or splits with its bill.\n\n**Magpie.**—Variegated black and white; tail wedged. Subject to considerable varieties. About eighteen inches long, and weighs between eight and nine ounces. Too well known to require particular description, being a common inhabitant of many parts of Europe, Asia, and America. Generally continues in pairs through the year; is mischievous and clamorous, and has a very indiscriminate appetite, rejecting hardly any species of animal food, or fruits, and devouring grain, when nothing else can be got. Is crafty and familiar; may be taught to pronounce words, and even short sentences, and will imitate any particular noise which it hears. Like other birds of its kind, is addicted to pilfering, and will hoard its provisions. The female builds her nest with great art, leaving a hole in the side for her admittance, and covering all the upper part with thorny branches, closely entangled, so as to secure her retreat from the rude attacks of other birds. The inside is furnished with a sort of matting, composed of wool, and other soft materials. She lays seven or eight eggs, of a pale green color, spotted with black. During winter nights, magpies assemble in great numbers in some coppice or thicket, to roost, but separate again in the day.\n\n**Mexican crow.**—Entirely bluish black. Bill, legs, and claws black. Size of the jackdaw. Inhabits New Spain, frequenting the neighborhood of towns, and perpetually chattering with a strong and sounding voice.\n\n**Alpine crow.**—Blackish; bill pale yellow, legs black. Size of the jackdaw; length fifteen inches. Inhabits the Alps and Pyrenees; has a harsh, disagreeable voice; lives on seeds and grain, and is injurious to corn fields. Its flesh is reckoned good eating.\n\n**Red-legged crow or Cornish chough.**—Violet blackish; bill and legs red. Weighs about fourteen ounces; length nearly seventeen inches. Inhabits the Alps, Norway, England, Egypt, and Persia. In this island, it seems to be chiefly confined to Devonshire, Cornwall, and Wales. Mr Pennant observes, that it is also found in some parts of Scotland and the Hebrides. It is seldom seen at any great distance from the sea coast, where it breeds in the rocks and caverns, and not unfrequently in ruined towers. The nest is composed of sticks, and lined with a great quantity of wool and hair. The eggs are generally five, of a dull white, sprinkled with light-brown and ash-colored spots, mostly at the larger end. The note of the Cornish chough is somewhat like that of the jackdaw, but more shrill. Its food is grain and insects, though, in a state of confinement, it will greedily feed on flesh. It is easily tamed, but crafty, and will hide not only part of its food, but things of value. It is even alleged, that houses have been set on fire by its carrying off lighted sticks in its bill.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 15. Coracias, Roller.**\n\nBill sharp-edged, bent in at the point, bare naked of coracoid feathers; tongue cartilaginous, and bifid; legs short; feet gressorial; toes three before, and one behind, divided to their origin.\n\nThis genus is not confined to any particular region of the globe, as one or other of the different species may be met with in each of the four quarters of the world.\n\n**Common or garrulous roller.**—Blue; back red; flag-Garrula; feathers black.—The only species that has ever been met with in England, and that very rarely. Length twelve inches and a half; size of a jay. Vies with some of the parrots, in its shades of blue and green, mixed with white, heightened by the contrast of graver colours. It is wilder than the jay; frequents the thickest woods, and builds its nest chiefly on birch trees. It is plentiful in Germany, Sicily, and Malta, where they are sold in the markets and poulterers shops. It feeds on frogs, beetles, acorns, grain, and fruit, and in cases of necessity, will even eat carrion. It is remarkable for making a chattering kind of noise. Its flesh tastes like that of a turtle.\n\n**Long-tailed roller.**—Bill blackish, one inch and a half long; hind parts of the head green; upper parts of the back and scapulars fulvous glossed with green; lower part of the back, rump, and wing coverts, fine blue; upper tail coverts blue green; two middle feathers of the tail deep green, rest blue green; outer ones on each side twice the length of the others, and the projecting part deep blue; the shafts of all black; legs gray; claws blackish. Inhabits Angola.\n\n**Docile or tame roller.**—White, interspersed with reddish, bay beneath; legs yellow; tail feathers black, tipped with white; bill yellow; claws flesh-color. Size of a jackdaw. Inhabits Persia; and has obtained its name from imitating the words and actions of those around it.\n\n**Noisy roller.**—Black; patch on the wings; vent, Strepera, bare, and tip of the tail white. This species is very numerous at Norfolk island; and is very clamorous, especially at night. It is a very foolish bird; running after any person, and allowing itself to be knocked down with a stick. It is about nineteen inches long, and rather bigger than a jackdaw.\n\n---\n\n**Gen. 16. Oriolus, Oriole.**\n\nBill conical, convex, very acute and straight; upper mandible somewhat longer than the under, and slightly emarginated; tongue bifid and acute; feet gressorial.\n\nThe birds of this genus are gregarious, noisy, numerous, voracious, and great devourers of corn. They chiefly inhabit America, and often build pendulous nests. The only European species, which also inhabits Asia and Africa, is the\n\n**Golden oriole, or golden thrush.**—Pale yellow; lores and limbs black; outer tail feathers yellow on the hind part; bill and irises yellow; legs plumbeous. Nine inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa; and is incident to several varieties. It is by no means uncommon in France, where it summers and breeds. Its nest is in the shape of a purse, fastened to the extreme divarications...\ndivarications of the outmost twigs of tall trees, and composed of fibres of hemp, or straw, mixed with fine dry stalks of grass, and lined within with moss and lichens. The female lays four or five eggs of a dirty white, marked with small brown spots. She sits three weeks, and will not unfrequently suffer herself to be taken with the eggs and nest, and continue to fit on them in a cage, till she dies. The golden oriole is partial to grapes, figs, cherries, berries, and insects. It has a loud cry. Its flesh is reckoned good eating.\n\nClimbing oriole.—Tawny; head, neck, and breast spotted with white; tail rounded; bill yellowish gray; legs blackish. Seven inches long. Inhabits Guiana, among trees, which it climbs like a pie, and picks out insects from under the bark.\n\nIcteris oriole.—Tawny; head, throat, back, quill and tail feathers, black; wings with a white spot; bill mostly black, with a brown base; irises yellowish; legs sometimes black and sometimes lead coloured, or gray white. Nine inches and a half long. Inhabits the warmer parts of America and the Caribbee islands. Domesticated for the purpose of killing insects. In its wild state it is very agile and bold. It builds a large cylindrical nest, suspended to the end of a twig of a tree, with a view to defend its young from the attacks of snakes and other animals. Of these nests several may sometimes be seen near to one another, and not far from housetops.\n\nPhoeniculus. Red-winged oriole.—Black; wing coverts tawny. Size of a starling; length from eight to nine inches. Occurs in Mexico, the Carolinas, Virginia, and as far as New York. Builds a thick penile nest among reeds, or between the forks of trees, three or four feet from the ground, along with other birds. In the swamps, which are seldom accessible by man. In Louisiana these birds appear only in winter, and sometimes in such immense flocks, that three hundred or more are taken at one draught of the net. These nests are spread on some bare smooth path, at the side of a wood, with rice strewed to decoy the birds. To secure the multitudes that are caught, it is often necessary to knock most of them on the head upon the spot. Their common name in America is maize-thief, which they have acquired from the circumstance of their pecking a hole in the plant when green, and destroying it.\n\nRed-breasted oriole, or mocking-bird of Guiana.—Black; chin, throat, breast, and upper corner of the wings red. Seven inches long, less than a blackbird. Inhabits Guiana and Cayenne; sings pleasantly, and imitates the notes of many other birds. The nest, which is built of hay, &c., is long, cylindrical, twelve or fifteen inches in circumference, and hangs from the high branches of the tallest trees.\n\nBlack and yellow oriole.—Black; hind part of the back, spot on the wing-coverts and base of the tail feathers, yellow. There are, however, several varieties. Bigger than a blackbird. Inhabits South America; forms a pendent nest, shaped like an alembic; four hundred of which may sometimes be seen together, hanging from the extreme branches of trees. The eggs are dirty white, with small pale brown spots.\n\nBaltimore oriole, or Baltimore bird.—Blackish; the under parts of the body, and the band on the wings tawny; bill lead colour; greater wing coverts black, tipped with white; first quill feathers dirty white, edged with white; two middle tail feathers black, the rest black on the lower part, and orange above. These birds are found in many parts of America, the northern regions of which they occupy in summer, advancing even to Montreal in May, and returning southward in winter, which accounts for their appearance in Maryland and Virginia at that time. They make their nest of a soft downy matter, in the shape of a purse, tying it with threads to the extreme forks of the twigs of the tulip, plane, and locust trees. The country people call them fire-birds; and indeed when in high plumage, their motions from branch to branch not unaptly resemble a flail of fire.\n\nWeaver oriole.—Yellow; head brown, with a shade of golden; quill and tail feathers blackish, edged with orange. Inhabits near the Senegal; size of the golden oriole. \"In the cage where these birds were kept, (says Dr Latham,) it was observed, that they entwined some of the stalks of the pimpernel, with which they were fed, in the wires; as this seemed to show a disposition of making a nest, some rush-stalks were put into the cage; on which they presently made a nest large enough to hide one of them at least; but it was as often disarranged as made, the work of one day being spoiled the next; serving to show that the fabrication of the nest in a state of nature was the work of both male and female, and in all probability is finished by the last. They had a sharp but lively note.\n\n\"A friend of mine described a bird to me, which he saw at the house of an acquaintance, which seemed to be this very bird. By accident having got a bit of sewing silk, it wove it among the wires of the cage, on which, more being put to it, it interlaced the whole very confusedly, so as to hinder most part of that side of the cage from being seen through. It was found to prefer green and yellow to any other coloured silk.\"\n\nBanana oriole.—Tawny; head and breast chestnut; banana back, quill, and tail feathers, black. Seven inches long. Inhabits South America and the West India islands. Makes a nest of a curious construction, composed of fibres and leaves, exactly in the shape of the fourth part of a globe, sewed with great art under a leaf of a banana tree, in such a manner that the leaf forms one side of the nest.\n\nHang-nest oriole, American hang-nest, Spanish night-Nidipendigale, &c.—Frontlet and wreath black; crown, neck, dulux, back, and tail, reddish-brown; breast and belly tawny yellow. Inhabits the woods in Jamaica; sings sweetly; and builds a pendulous nest of stalks or thready moss, on the extreme branch of a high tree.\n\nGen. 17. Gracula, Grackle.\n\nBill convex, sharp-edged, somewhat naked at the base; tongue entire, somewhat sharp, fleety; feet formed characters for walking.\n\nAll the species are extra-European; have a thick bill, compressed at the sides, with small nostrils at the base, and sharp-hooked claws; the middle toe of the fore-feet connected at the base to the outer.\n\nMinor, or religious grackle.—Violet black; spot on the wings white; hind-head with a yellow naked band. Size of a blackbird; length ten inches and a half. Inhabits\nhabits various parts of the East Indies; is very fond of cherries and grapes; and can be easily trained to whistle, sing, or speak.\n\nBoat-tailed grackle.—Grayish; shoulders blue; quill feathers green on the outside. Size of a cuckoo, nearly thirteen inches long. The folding up of the tail feathers, instead of forming a plain surface at top, sinks into a hollow, like a deep gutter, which singularity is manifest only when the bird is flying, or perched, for when on the ground, it always carries its tail expanded. It inhabits Jamaica and North America, keeping company with the maize-thief and red-winged oriole. It feeds on maize, the fruit of the banana, &c., as well as on bees and other insects.\n\nPurple grackle.—Violet black; tail rounded. Upwards of thirteen inches long, though the female measures only eleven and a half. Inhabits Mexico, the warm parts of America, and Jamaica; sings sweetly; feeds on all kinds of grain, and makes great havoc in the maize plantations. It lays five or six blueish eggs, with black stripes and spots.\n\nGen. 18. Paradisaea, Bird of Paradise.\n\nBill covered with a belt of downy feathers at the base; feathers of the sides very long; two of the tail feathers naked. Legs and feet very large and strong; three toes forward, one backward, the middle connected to the outer one as far as the first joint.\n\nThe birds of this genus, till lately, were very imperfectly known, and had given rise to various idle tales, such as their never alighting on the ground from their birth to their death; their living entirely on dew; their being produced without legs, &c. The circumstance which led to the last-mentioned error, was merely accidental; the legs and coarser parts of the wings having been pulled off in the course of preparing the birds for an ornamental article of dress. Though the birds of paradise occur in Japan, China, Persia, and various parts of India, they are believed to be properly natives of New Guinea, where they breed. The Dutch get them chiefly from Banda, where the story of their want of legs has been propagated, in order to enhance their value.\n\nGreat bird of Paradise.—Feathers of the hypochondria longer than the body; the two intermediate tail feathers longest and fattest; the size of the body scarcely exceeds that of a thrush, though the plumage would indicate a bird as large as a pigeon; the length from the end of the bill to that of the tail is twelve inches and a half; the bill is greenish yellow, and an inch and a half long; the eyes are very small; the head, which is also small in proportion to the bird, as well as the throat and neck are covered with very short, dense, stiff feathers, of which those on the head and hind part of the neck are of a pale gold colour; the base of the bill is surrounded with black feathers, appearing like velvet, and changing in different lights to green; the fore part of the neck is golden green; the lower part of the neck behind the back, wings, and tail, are chestnut; the breast is of a deep chestnut, verging to purple; from under the wings proceeds a great quantity of feathers, with the webs so loose, as to appear like a herring-bone, some of them nearly eighteen inches long, some chestnut and purplish, others yellowish, and a few almost white; from the rump arise two feathers without webs, except for four inches next the base, and the same at the tips; the legs are stout and of a brown colour. These birds are found in the Molucca islands, and those surrounding New Guinea, particularly in Aroo, where they arrive with the wetterly or dry monsoon, and whence they return to New Guinea, when the easterly or wet monsoon sets in. They are seen going and returning in flights of thirty or forty, conducted by a leader, which flies higher than the rest. During this flight they cry like flarlings. By a sudden shifting of the wind, their long scapular feathers are sometimes so dishevelled as to preclude flying, when they fall to the ground, or are lost in the water. In the former case they cannot rise again into the air, without gaining an eminence, and are secured by the natives, and killed on the spot, as they cannot be preserved alive by art. They are likewise caught with bird-lime, or shot with blunt arrows, or intoxicated with the berries of menispernum cocculus put into the water which they are accustomed to drink. Their real food is not known with certainty. According to some, they feed on the red berries of the warung tree (ficus benjamina), according to others, they are particularly fond of nutmegs; some assert that they live on large butterflies, and others, that they chase and devour small birds. It is only for ornament that they are coveted by each of the inhabitants of the east as are able to purchase them, the chiefs of the country wearing them constantly in their turbans. The grandees of Perlia, Surat, and the East Indies, use them as aigrettes, and even adorn their horses with them. There is a lesser variety of this species, found in the Papua islands.\n\nKing's bird of Paradise, or king's bird.—Chestnut Regia purple, whitish beneath; two middle tail-feathers filiform, feathered, and semilunar at the tips; breast bluish; cirri of the tail very long; feathers under the wings longer than the rest; tail short, truncate; from five to seven inches long, and about the size of a lark. It is said not to associate with any other of the birds of paradise, but shifts solitary from bush to bush in quest of red berries, and never gets on tall trees. It occurs in the islands of the Indian ocean, and returns to New Guinea in the rainy season, but is much more scarce than the preceding.\n\nMagnificent bird of Paradise.—Chestnut brown above; Magnifica chin green, with golden lunules; crown with a tuft of yellow feathers; first quill-feathers brown, secondary deep yellow; middle tail-feathers very long, with a very short fringe; legs and bill yellow, and the latter black at the tip and base. A singular and beautiful species, figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\nGorget bird of Paradise.—Black, slight green beneath; hind head, nape, crown, and band on the middle of the belly fine green, a splendid gold-coloured crescent under the chin; tail feathers 12, unequal, the outer ones five inches long, and the two in the middle 22. Twenty-eight inches long. Figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\nSuperb bird of Paradise.—Crested; head, crown, and Superba belly green; chin violet, silky; wings black; tail with a shade of green; bill black; legs brown, under the wings a tuft of loofe, black, silky feathers, as long as the wings when folded. Eight inches and eight lines long. Native of the northern parts of New Guinea.\nWhite bird of Paradise.—Entirely white. Inhabits the Papuan islands, and is very rare.\n\nGen. 19. Trogan, Curucui.\n\nBill shorter than the head, sharp-edged, hooked; mandibles ferrated at the edge; feet fcanforial; body long; nostrils covered with bristles; feet short, woolly; tail very long, consisting of 12 feathers.\n\nThe birds of this genus are all inhabitants of the tropical regions, and mostly inhabit South America. They live solitary, in the thickest recesses of moist woods, fitting and building on the lower branches of trees. They take but a short flight, and feed on insects and fruit. As they differ much in appearance, in different stages of life, a considerable degree of confusion has prevailed in the illustration of the species. They have the name of curucui from their note.\n\nRed-bellied curucui.—Of a greenish-gold colour, tawny beneath; throat black; lateral tail feathers, with white and black bars, the middle ones tipped with black. Somewhat less than a magpie; length 10 inches and a half. Inhabits Mexico, Brazil, and Peru. There are two or three varieties. At pairing time, only two or three are found together; and the male has a kind of melancholy note, by which their haunts are discovered. They begin to pair in April, and build in the hole of a rotten tree, laying three or four white eggs, about as big as those of a pigeon, on the bare rotten stuff. During the incubation of the female, the male takes care to provide food for her, and to beguile the time by his song. The parents feed the young with small worms, caterpillars, and insects; and, when their nestlings are able to shift for themselves, they forsake them, and return to their solitary haunts, till nature prompts them to produce their second brood in August or September. Various attempts have been made, but without effect, to domesticate this species, as it obliquely refuses food, when in confinement.\n\nGen. 20. Bucco, Barbet.\n\nBill cultrate, compressed laterally; apex emarginated on both sides, and incurved, gape reaching below the eyes; nostrils covered with recumbent feathers; feet fcanforial; bill strong, somewhat straight, almost covered with bristles; tail feathers usually ten.\n\nThe birds of this genus are all inhabitants of Africa, and the warmer parts of Asia and America, and are a dull and stupid race.\n\nSpotted-bellied barbet.—Tawny brown, tawny white, spotted with black beneath; chin tawny; neck with a tawny lunule varied with black, a black spot behind the eyes; head very large; bill black; crown and front tawnyish; legs black. This bird occurs both at Cayenne and Brazil. It is clumsy, solitary, silent, and pensive, afflicting only such places as are farthest from habitations, generally in the woods, where it chooses some low branch, well covered with twigs and foliage, on which it perches, with its large head resting between its shoulders for a long time together, allowing itself to be shot at several times before it makes its escape. It feeds on insects, particularly large beetles.\n\nBeautiful barbet.—Green; head and chin red, edged with blue; quill feathers brown, throat and breast yellow, the latter spotted with red; belly yellow, spotted with green; bill, legs, and claws cinereous, the latter tipped with yellow; a blue streak on each side of the mouth; tail wedged; quill feathers edged with green. Size of a sparrow, nearly six inches long. Inhabits the country of Maynas, on the borders of the Amazons, and is the most beautiful and active of the tribe.\n\nGen. 21. Cuculus, Cuckoo.\n\nBill smooth, weak, a little curved; nostrils bounded by a small rim; tongue arrowed, short, and pointed; feet fcanforial.\n\nOf upwards of 50 species belonging to this genus, the first mentioned only is a native of Great Britain; and very few of the others are natives of Europe.\n\nCommon cuckoo.—Cinereous, whitish beneath, transversely streaked with brown; tail rounded, blackish, dotted with white; edges of the eyelids, opening of the mouth and palate saffron; when young, the whole body is brownish, the feathers edged with white; the upper part of the body is sometimes varied with reddish. It likewise occurs with wavings of gray; a double row of white dots on the middle tail feathers, and the bill, orbits, and legs of a sulphur colour. Size of the turtle dove 14 inches long, and weighs about four ounces and a half. The female is rather less, and, in general, differs from the other sex, in the neck and breast, being of a tawnyish brown, barred with dusky, and the wing-coverts marked with light ferruginous spots. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa.—This well-known bird comes to us early in the spring, and almost invariably leaves us by the first of July, though the females may sometimes remain a little later, till they have deposited all their eggs. Such as are seen about the latter end of September or beginning of October, are the young of that year, or stragglers which have been wounded. The singular note of the male has given rise to the name of this bird, in most languages; the female is either silent, or makes only a chattering noise. Cuckoos build no nest, and what is more extraordinary, the female deposits her solitary egg in the nest of another bird, by which it is hatched. The nest which she selects for this purpose is usually that of the hedge sparrow, though sometimes also that of the water-wagtail, tit-lark, yellow hammer, green linnet, &c. Dr Jenner, in his valuable communication to the Royal Society, published in the second part of the 78th volume of their Transactions, observes, that while the hedge sparrow is laying her eggs, which generally takes up four or five days, the cuckoo contrives to deposit her egg among the rest, leaving the future care of it entirely to the hedge sparrow. This intrusion often occasions some discomposure, for the old hedge sparrow at intervals, while she is sitting, not only throws out some of her own eggs, but sometimes injures them in such a way, that they become addle; so that it frequently happens that not more than two or three of the parent bird's eggs are hatched with that of the cuckoo: and, what is very remarkable, it has never been observed, that the hedge sparrow has either thrown out or injured the egg of the cuckoo. When the hedge sparrow has sat her usual time, and has discharged the young cuckoo and some of her own offspring from the shell, her own young ones, and any of her eggs that remain unhatched, are soon turned out; the young\nyoung cuckoo then remains in full possession of the nest, and is the sole object of the future care of its foster-parent. \"The mode of accomplishing this, (says the ingenious and interesting inquirer, in reporting his observations on a particular case,) was curious; the little animal, with the assistance of its rump and wings, contrived to get the bird upon its back, and making a lodgement for its burden, by elevating its elbows, clambered backwards with it up the side of the nest till it reached the top, where, resting for a moment, it threw off its load with a jerk, and quite disengaged it from the nest. After remaining a short time in this situation, and feeling about with the extremities of its wings, as if to be convinced that the business was properly executed, it dropped into the nest again.\" Dr Jenner made several experiments in different nests, by repeatedly putting in an egg to the young cuckoo, which he always found to be disposed of in the same manner. But we are reluctantly compelled to withhold various other interesting details relative to this subject, and to refer our readers to the original communication. The young birds are observed to be helpless and foolish for a great length of time, but are capable of being tamed, and, when in confinement, will eat bread and milk, fruits, insects, eggs, and fish, either cooked or raw; but, in a state of nature, they live chiefly on caterpillars and insects.\n\nLong-billed rain cuckoo.—Tail wedged; body brownish, tefaceous beneath; eyelids red. Rather bigger than a blackbird. Inhabits woods and shrubberies in Jamaica, is easily tamed, flies short, sings before rain, and feeds on grains, insects, worms, small serpents, frogs, lizards, and small birds.\n\nRain cuckoo.—Olive ash, rufous beneath; chin and throat white; outer tail feathers edged with white. From 16 to 17 inches long, like the preceding. Inhabits Jamaica, and sings before rain. Both species are familiarly known by the names of old man, and rain bird.\n\nLaughing cuckoo.—Tawny; chin, throat, and breast cinereous; belly, thighs, and lower tail coverts black; bill bluish black; irides white; tail half as long as the body. Sixteen inches long. Inhabits New Spain; has a voice like a man laughing, on which account it is dreaded by the Indians as ominous.\n\nCoromandel crested cuckoo.—Upper parts of the body black; under part white; a white spot on the edge of the wing; tail wedge-shaped and tipped with white; head crested; bill black; legs brown. Length eleven inches. Inhabits the coast of Coromandel.\n\nPifan cuckoo.—Tail wedged; body above varied with white and black, white beneath; head black and crested; chin and breast rufous. Rather larger than the common species, and has its name from having been once caught in Pifa.\n\nBee cuckoo, honey-guide, moroc, &c.—Rusty gray, white beneath; eyelids naked; black; shoulders with a yellow spot; tail wedged, rusty; bill brown at the base, and surrounded with bristles, yellow at the tip; feathers of the thighs white, with a longitudinal black streak; quill feathers brown above, gray brown beneath; first tail feathers very narrow, rusty; the rest brown at the tip on the inner web. Somewhat larger than the common sparrow. Native of the interior parts of Africa. This bird is very fond of honey and bee maggots; but being unable, by its own efforts, to procure them from the hollow of trees, it points out to man and to the animal called ratel, the nests of wild bees. The morning and the evening are its principal meal times; at least it is then that it shows the greatest inclination to come forth, and with a grating cry of cherr, cherr, cherr, to excite the attention of the ratel, as well as of the Hottentots and colonists. Somebody then generally repairs to the place whence the sound proceeds, when the bird, continually repeating its cry, flies on slowly and by degrees to the quarter where the bees have taken up their abode. The persons thus invited, follow accordingly, taking great care, at the same time, not to frighten their guide by any unusual noise; but rather to answer it now and then with a very soft and gentle whistle, by way of letting the bird know, that its call is attended to. When the bee's nest is at some distance, the bird often makes long flights, or flights, waiting for its sporting companions between each flight, and calling to them again to come on; but it flies to shorter distances, and repeats its cry more frequently, and with greater earnestness, in proportion as they approach nearer the nest. When the bird has sometimes, in consequence of its impatience, got too far a-head of its companions, but particularly when, on account of the unevenness of the ground, they have not been able to keep pace with it, it will fly back to meet them, and, with redoubled cries, denoting still greater impatience, upbraid them as it were, for being so tardy. When it arrives at the nest, whether the latter is built in the cleft of a rock, or in a hollow tree, or in some cavity of the earth, it hovers over the spot for a few seconds, then sits in silence, and for the most part concealed, in some neighbouring tree or bush, in expectation of the result, and with a view of receiving its share of the booty. Nor is it disappointed; the hunters, by way of acknowledgement, leaving it a considerable portion of that part of the comb in which the bees are hatching. Mr Barrow corroborates these details, and adds, that the moroc intimates to the inhabitants with equal certainty the dens of lions, tigers, hyenas, and other beasts of prey, and noxious animals. Le Vaillant mentions that the Hottentots are very partial to this bird on account of its services, and that once when he was on the point of shooting one, they threatened him to spare its life. Mr Bruce, by confounding this species with another, peculiar to Abyssinia, has indulged in some very misplaced strictures on the accounts of Sparrman and Lobo.\n\nGen. 22. Yunx.\n\nBill smoothish, cylindrical, pointed, a little curved, weak; nostrils concave, naked; tongue very long, smooth, worm-shaped, armed at the point; tail feathers 10, flexible; feet fanatorial.\n\nThis genus consists of only one species, and has, by most authors, been held distinct; for, though allied to some other genera, it perfectly coincides with none. The tongue and disposition of the toes correspond to those of the woodpecker; but the weakness of the bill distinguishes it from that family. It seems also to be nearly related to the cuckoo, did not its length of tongue form a marked distinction.\n\nWryneck.—Gray, varied with brown, and blackish belly reddish, with blackish spots; tail feathers waved with...\nwith black spots, streaks, and bars. Description, however, is very inadequate to convey an accurate idea of the elegant markings of this little bird. Its name seems to have been given it from the singular manner of turning its head over its shoulder and perpetually looking about, when the black line on the back of the neck gives it a twisted appearance. The weight of this beautiful bird is about ten drams, and its length seven inches. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa, appearing in Britain about the same time with the cuckoo, and chiefly frequenting woods, or thickly inclosed countries, where trees or orchards abound. Its food principally consists of ants and other insects, of which it finds great abundance lodged in the bark and crevices of trees, and which it secures by a horny substance at the end of its long tongue. It likewise frequents ant hills, into which it darts its tongue, and draws out its prey. It is never seen with any other society than that of its female, and, as soon as the domestic union is dissolved, which is in September, they retire and migrate by themselves. It makes an artless nest of dry grass, on duty rotten wood, in holes of trees, and lays nine or ten eggs, which are white and transparent. If surprised in its nest, it stretches itself at full length; and erecting the feathers on the crown of its head, suddenly rises, making, at the same time, a short hissing noise, like that of a turkey cock. In the beginning of spring, it very frequently repeats a noise like that of the smaller species of hawks.\n\nGen. 23. Picus, Woodpecker.\n\nBill angular, straight, wedged at the tip; nostrils covered with recumbent feathery feathers; tongue round, worm-shaped, very long, bony, muffle, daggered, befit at the point with reflexed bristles; tail feathers ten, hard, rigid, pointed; feet scansorial.\n\nThe birds of this genus climb trees, particularly those that are decaying or dead, in search of insects and their larvae. The bone of their tongue terminates in two long slender cartilages, which proceed from below upwards, and from behind forwards, over the whole skull, under the skin, and are attached to the forehead near the base of the bill. By means of these elastic cartilages, the woodpeckers thrust out their filiform tongue to catch insects. The feet are formed for climbing; their tail is fitted for resistance and support, and their sharp-pointed and barbed tongue enables them to extract insects from their lurking places in trees. They are therefore unjustly persecuted and driven from plantations. They make their nests in hollows of trees. They have a membranous stomach and want the caecum.\n\nGreat black woodpecker.—Black, cap vermilion. In the female the hind head only is red; length 17 inches and a half. Size of a jackdaw; bill nearly two inches and a half long, of a dark ash colour, and whitish on the sides; irides pale yellow. Has all the habits of the green woodpecker, and is a great destroyer of bees. Makes its nest deep in some tree, which it has excavated for the purpose, and lays two or three white eggs; a circumstance which seems peculiar to most of the genus. Occurs in Europe, Siberia, and Chili; but rarely visits England.\n\nRed-headed woodpecker.—Head wholly red; wings and tail black; belly white. Eight inches and three quarters-long, and weighs two or three ounces. This species inhabits Virginia, Carolina, Canada, &c.; but, on the approach of winter, migrates more or less to the southward, according to the severity of the season, from which circumstance the North Americans foretell the rigour or clemency of the ensuing winter. The red-headed woodpeckers are very destructive to maize fields and orchards, and are fond of acorns. During the winter they are very tame, and sometimes come into houses, as the red-breast with us. They are found chiefly in old trees; and the noise that they make with their bills may sometimes be heard at a mile's distance.\n\nGold-winged woodpecker.—Striated transversely with auratus black and gray; chin and breast black; nape red; rump white. Chin of the female cinereous; length 11 inches; weight five ounces. Inhabits North America; is almost continually on the ground; feeds on worms and insects; and, in default of these, on berries and grubs. When fat, is esteemed good eating.\n\nGreen woodpecker.—Green; crown of the head crimson; son; bill dusky, two inches long; inner circle of the irides reddish; outer white; temples blackish; quill feathers dusky, with whitish spots; tail blackish, obscurely barred with green, and tipped with white; legs greenish ash. Weighs about six ounces, and is thirteen inches long. Inhabits Europe, and is by no means uncommon in the wooded parts of England. It feeds on insects, and is particularly fond of bees. It is frequently seen climbing up a tree, or on the ground, in the neighbourhood of an ant hill. The hole which they make is as perfect a circle as if it had been described by a pair of compasses. It is curious to observe them try every part of a dead limb of a tree, till they have discovered the most porous, and then the strokes are reiterated with such velocity, that the head is scarcely perceived to move. The softer woods, such as the elm, ash, and sycamore, are, for the most part, attacked, for the purpose of nidification, and are perforated only where they exhibit symptoms of decay. The excavations are often deep, to give security to the eggs, which are generally four or five, and placed on the rotten wood, without any nest.\n\nDowny woodpecker.—Back longitudinally downy; pubescens; outer tail feathers white, with four black spots. Weighs an ounce and a half, and measures only five inches and a half in length. Inhabits Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, &c., and is a daring bird, and dangerous to orchards. As soon as it has pecked one hole in a tree, it makes another close to the first, in a horizontal direction, proceeding till it has made a circle of holes quite round the trunk, so that the tree frequently dries up and decays.\n\nHairy woodpecker.—Back somewhat downy, in a Villarius longitudinal direction; outer tail feathers entirely white. From nine to twelve inches long. Like the former, is the pest of orchards. Inhabits North America, from Hudson's Bay to Carolina; and likewise occurs in the north of England.\n\nGreater spotted woodpecker.—Variegated with black Major and white; hind head and vent red. Female, without red on the hind head. The weight of this species is about two ounces and three quarters, and the length nine inches. The bill is dusky, and an inch and quarter long; the irides are reddish brown. Inhabits Europe, North America, and Siberia. Is less frequent in England than the green species, to which it is nearly allied.\nallied in manners and habits, except that it rarely descends to the ground in search of food. Lays four or five white and glossy eggs on the decayed wood, without any formal preparation of a nest.\n\nMiddle-spotted woodpecker.—Variegated with white and black; vent and cap red; cheeks white; three lateral tail feathers, tipped with white. Supposed by some to be only the young of the preceding species.\n\nLesser-spotted woodpecker.—Variegated with white and black; crown red; vent teltaceous or brick-coloured. There are two or three varieties. The weight of this small species is not quite five drams; and the length is about five inches and a half. Inhabits Europe and Asia, and has the habits of the major; but is of more rare occurrence.\n\nMinute woodpecker.—Chefnut gray; whitish, waved with brown beneath; crown red; hind head black, spotted with white. Only three inches and a half long, the least of its tribe. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\nCardinal woodpecker.—Black; under part of the body white, spotted with black; crown and back part of the head red; wings spotted with white; legs and bill blackish. Inhabits the isle of Luzonia.\n\nGen. 24. Sitta, Nuthatch.\n\nBill subulated, roundish, unbent, projecting straight forwards, and entire; the upper mandible somewhat longer than the under, compressed at the point; tongue notched, short, and horny at the apex; nostrils small, covered with bristles; feet gregarious.\n\nThe general manners of the whole of this genus are supposed to correspond with those of the ensuing species, which is the only one that is found in Britain.\n\nEuropean nuthatch.—Cinerous, reddish beneath; tail feathers black, the four lateral ones beneath tipped with white. A black line through the eyes and ears; rump white, varied with rusty; the first tail feather with a white bar, two with a white spot, three or four tipped with white, five colour of the back. Inhabits Europe and Asia. Remains in England the whole year; but is local, and chiefly affects wooded and inclosed situations, selecting the deserted habitation of a woodpecker for its nest. The hole is first contracted by a plaster of clay, leaving only sufficient room for the bird to pass in and out. The nest is made of dead leaves, especially of those of the oak, which are heaped together without much order. The number of eggs is six or seven, and they are scarcely to be distinguished from those of the great titmouse, in size and markings. If the plaster at the entrance be destroyed when there are eggs in the nest, it is speedily replaced, to prevent the intrusion of the woodpecker and other birds of superior size which build in the same situation. No persecution will force this little bird from its habitation when fitting. It defends its nest to the last extremity, strikes the invader with its bill and wings, makes a hissing noise; and, after every effort of defence has been practised in vain, will suffer itself to be taken in the hand rather than desert its charge. The nuthatch is more expert in climbing than the woodpecker; for it runs in all directions up and down a tree. When employed in breaking a nut, its favourite position is with the head downwards. In the autumn it is no uncommon thing to find, in the crevices of the bark of an old tree, a great many broken nut shells, the work of this bird, which repeatedly returns to the same spot for this purpose. When it has fixed the nest firm in a chink, it turns on all sides, to strike it with most advantage. This, with the common hazel-nut, is a work of some labour; but it breaks a fibbert with ease. In default of nuts, this bird searches for insects and their larvae among the mosses on trees and old thatched buildings. It is commonly met with among orchards, and is sometimes seen, in the cider season, picking the seeds from the refuse of the pressed apples. In spring it has a remarkably loud, shrill whistle, which ceases after incubation, and gives place, in autumn, to a double reiterated cry. It deserves to be remarked, that the singular jarring noise produced by some species of woodpeckers, by repeated strokes of the bill against the decayed limb of a tree, has been erroneously ascribed to the nuthatch.\n\nSurinam nuthatch.—Reddish chestnut, dirty white beneath; middle of the back white; wings and tail black; first and tail coverts tipped, and secondary quill feathers edged with white. Only three inches and a half long. Inhabits Surinam.\n\nGen. 25. Todus, Tody.\n\nBill subulate, somewhat depressed, obtuse, straight, covered at the base with bristles; nostrils small, oval; feet gregarious.\n\nThese mostly inhabit the warmer regions of America, and are nearly related to the family of fly-catchers; but are distinguished from them by having the middle and outer toe much connected, which, in the fly-catchers, are divided to the base.\n\nGreen tody.—Green, yellowish rosy beneath; breast viridus; red; upper mandible brown, lower orange; irides chestnut; cheeks with a red spot; legs and claws gray. The male, according to Buffon, has the upper part of the body of a pale blue, the belly white, the breast and sides rose colour. This pretty species, which is about the size of a wren, and four inches long, occurs not only in the warmer parts of the American continent, but also in St Domingo, Jamaica, and other islands of the West Indies. The females are not uncommon in Jamaica. It is supposed to feed on soft insects, and is of a fly solitary disposition, frequenting the lonely parts of moist tracts of country, where it is observed to fit all of a heap, its head drawn in between its shoulders, and so stupid as almost to allow itself to be taken by the hand.\n\nWhite-headed tody.—Black; subcrested head and chin leucocephalus; white; bill blackish; the lower mandible white, tipped blackish; wings short; tail even. Less than the redstart. Inhabits America. Figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\nOlive tody.—Olive brown, yellowish-white beneath; olive crown, quill, and tail feathers blackish. Size of the hedge sparrow. Inhabits North America, where it feeds on insects. Frequent the decayed parts of trees, and has all the actions of the fly-catcher. It has an agreeable note, two or three times repeated, but not what can be called a song.\n\nKing tody.—Blackish brown, reddish beneath; crest regius; chestnut, spotted with white at the tip; chin and eyelids white; bill dusky brown; breast with transverse blackish lines; legs flesh colour. This singular and beautiful species\nspecies measures seven inches in length. Inhabits Cayenne, and is very rare.\n\nBroad-billed tody.—Yellowish-brown, yellow beneath; chin and spot on the crown white; wings and tail brown; bill very large and broad. Size of the nightingale. Figured by Latham.\n\nCrested tody.—Crest scarlet; body brown, spotted with white; wing coverts spotted with white; feathers of the crest tipped with black. Native of Guinea.\n\nGen. 26. Alcedo, King's-fisher.\n\nBill triangular, thick, straight, long, and acuminate; the tongue fleshy, very short, flat, and acute; feet, for the most part, gregarious.\n\nThe birds of this genus are dispersed over the whole globe; though it is supposed that only one species inhabits Europe. Most of them frequent rivers and the vicinity of waters, and live on fish, which they catch with singular art and dexterity. Sometimes they hover over the water, where a shoal of small fishes is seen playing near the surface; at other times, they wait with attention on some low branch, hanging over the water, for the approach of a single one, which is so unlucky as to swim that way. In either case they drop like a stone, or rather dart with rapidity on their prey. They seize the latter crofs-ways in their bill, retire to a resting place to feed on it, devour it piecemeal, bones and all; and afterwards bring up the indigestible parts in pellets. The wings of most of this genus are very short; yet the birds fly rapidly, and with great strength. In their colours, blue of different shades predominates. Their nostrils are small, and generally covered.\n\nCrested king's-fisher.—Bill black; an inch and a half long; crown feathers long, forming a crest, of a greenish colour, and barred with black; a fine blue stripe on each side of the neck; upper part of the body bright blue; upper wing coverts violet, and each feather tipped with a bright blue spot; legs and claws reddish; length nearly five inches. Inhabits Amboyna and the Philippine islands.\n\nSplendid king's-fisher.—Tail short; body yellowish-green; shoulders, throat, and rump yellow; wings and crown of the head blue; bill yellowish-brown colour; head with a bright yellow stripe on each side; smaller wing coverts edged with yellow; legs reddish-brown. A beautiful species, which inhabits South America.\n\nCommon king's-fisher.—Tail short; body blue above, orange-coloured beneath; lores red; bill black; crown and wing coverts green, with blue spots; tail of a beautiful blue; irides and legs red. In the female the bill is not so long as in the other sex. Frequent running streams and rivers, in the banks of which it generally takes possession of a rat's hole to deposit its eggs. This hole is ascending, and generally two or three feet in the bank; at the end is scooped a hollow, at the bottom of which is a quantity of small fish-bones, nearly half an inch thick, mixed with the earth, and which are probably the castings of the parent birds, as they are found even before they have eggs. On this digested matter the female lays to the number of seven eggs, which are perfectly white and transparent, and of a short oval form. Before the young are able to fly, the hole becomes extremely fetid by the faeces of the brood, which cannot be carried away by the parent birds, as is common with most of the smaller species. As the old birds have nothing in their bill, when they go in to feed their young, it has been inferred, that they eject from the stomach for that purpose. When the young are nearly full feathered, they are extremely voracious, and may be discovered by their constant chirping. This species is reckoned the most beautiful of all the British birds, weighs one ounce and a quarter, and measures seven inches in length. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. It was formerly believed that if the body of this bird was suspended by a thread, some magnetic influence always turned its breast to the north. This, however, is as fabulous as the tradition, that its stuffed skin will preserve woollen cloth from the depredations of moths. There is a variety found in Senegal, about six inches and a half long, blue green varied with brown above, tawny beneath, and chin yellowish.\n\nBelted king's-fisher.—Tail long, crested, blueish; belly white; breast ferruginous; a white spot before and behind the eyes; bill black; chin white; breast with a ferruginous band on the fore part; thighs rusty; thighs very short; legs brown; outer toe connected with the middle toe. Eleven inches long. Inhabits Carolina, and feeds on lizards and fish. It is subject to several permanent varieties, which occur in different parts of America.\n\nAmazonian king's-fisher.—Glossy green; under parts of the body and lunule on the neck white; sides variegated with green; tail spotted with white; bill and legs black. Twenty inches long. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\nRespected king's-fisher.—Tail long; body olive above, white beneath; eyebrows white; collar greenish black. Bill black; lower mandible white. Legs black. Eight inches and a half long. Native of the Society islands, where it is held sacred by the inhabitants, as are the species denominated venerata and sacra.\n\nGreat brown king's-fisher.—Crested, olive above, whitish and obscurely striated beneath; temples and hind head dirty white; tail rounded with rusty and steel-blue lines, and tipped with white. The female has no crest. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits New Guinea.\n\nCrab-eating king's-fisher.—Tail long; body blue-green, cancro-yellowish-tawny beneath; band through the eyes; wing coverts and tips of the quill feathers black. Twelve inches long. Inhabits Senegal, and feeds on crabs.\n\nEgyptian king's-fisher.—Brown, with rusty spots; Egyptia whitish, with cinereous spots beneath. Size of the Royton crow. Inhabits Lower Egypt, about Cairo; builds in fycamore and date trees, and feeds on frogs, insects, and small fish, which last it meets with in the field, when they are flooded. Its cry approaches to that of the common crow.\n\nGen. 27. Galbulia, Jacamar.\n\nBill straight, very long, quadrangular, pointed; nostrils oval, at the base of the bill; tongue short, sharp-pointed; thighs downy on the fore part; feet fanatorial.\n\nThis is much allied to the preceding; but the toes are differently placed, namely, two before and two behind. The food of the jacamar is likewise different, as it feeds on insects alone; and, for that purpose, frequents moist woods.\nwoods. Only four species have been described, and scarcely any information has hitherto been obtained relative to their economy and manners.\n\nGreat jacamar.—Copper gold above, ferruginous beneath; head and limbs green gold; tail wedged, and longer than the body. Size of the green woodpecker. Native country unknown.\n\nParadise jacamar.—Two middle tail feathers very long; body golden green; throat and wings white beneath; bill and legs black; head violet brown; tail much wedged. Inhabits Cayenne and Surinam; is 11 inches and a half long; flies in pairs; is less solitary than its congeners, and feeds on insects.\n\nGen. 28. Merops, Bee-eater.\n\nBill curved, quadrangular, compressed, carinated, pointed; nostrils small, at the base of the bill; tongue slender, the tip generally jagged; feet gregarious.\n\nThe birds of this genus, with a few exceptions, inhabit the old continent. Their general food is insects, and they are particularly fond of bees and wasps. They have no note beyond a whistle, and that far from agreeable. Like the king's-fisher, they breed in holes in the banks of rivers.\n\nCommon bee-eater.—Back ferruginous; belly and tail bluish-green; two of the tail feathers longer than the others; chin pale yellow; bill black; irides red; front blue green; crown, hind head, and neck, bay; a black streak from the bill to the hind head; tail wedged, the feathers edged inwardly with cinereous; legs chestnut; claws reddish-black. A variety sometimes occurs with the bill convex and uncarnated, and the toes unconnected at the last joint. The common bee-eater measures 10 inches from bill to tail. It inhabits various parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa; and is very plentiful in the southern parts of Russia, particularly about the rivers Don and Wolga. In the third volume of the Linnaean Transactions an account is given of one of this species having been shot, for the first time, in Britain, near Mattishall, in Norfolk, in July 1794. A flight of about 20 was seen in June; and the same flight, as was supposed, much diminished in number, was observed passing over the same spot in October following. They feed, on the wing, upon bees, gnats, flies, and other insects; or, in defect of these, upon seeds. Their nest is composed of moss, and the eggs, from five to seven, are perfectly white, and about the size of those of a starling. They are gregarious and migratory, quitting the colder latitudes, in great flocks, in autumn. When the sun shines on them, in their flight, they are a pleasing object, as they appear gilded. Kolben remarks, that they guide the Hottentots to the honey, which the bees lay up in the crevices of the rocks.\n\nIndian bee-eater.—Green; band on the breast black; chin and tail blue; two of the tail feathers longer than the others; bill and band across the eyes black; legs brown. There are several varieties. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits India.\n\nSuperb bee-eater.—Red; front, throat, and rump, blue; two middle tail feathers longer than the others. Nine inches long.\n\nWattled, or New Holland bee-eater.—Brown; belly yellow; wattles carunculated; tail wedged, tipped with white; bill black; nostrils pervious, and half covered with a membrane; crown blackish; a silvery stripe at the angle of the mouth; a long, orange, pendent caruncle behind the base of the lower mandible; legs brownish, the outer toe connected at the base to the middle one. Fourteen inches and a half long. Inhabits New Holland; is pretty numerous on the sea shores of that country; chatters incessantly; is very bold; feeds on insects, and sucks the honey from the different sorts of Banikia.\n\nHorned, or knob-fronted bee-eater.—Brown; head Cornicula—somewhat naked; under parts of the body and tips of toes; the tail feathers whitish; a blunt short eminence, like the rudiment of a horn, on the fore head. Size of a missel thrush. This singular species also inhabits New Holland, and is well figured in White's Journal.\n\nRed-winged bee-eater.—Under part of the body of an Erythrolaevicorne dirty-white colour; throat yellow; wings and pterus tail red, tipped with black; bill one inch long, black; legs black. Six inches long. Inhabits Senegal.\n\nGen. 29. Upupa, Hoopoe, or Hoopoe.\n\nBill arched, long, slender, convex, a little compressed, somewhat obtuse; nostrils small, at the base of the bill; tongue obtuse, entire, triangular, very short feet gregarious.\n\nOf the species included under this genus, the first only is found in Britain. They feed on insects, haunt dunghills, and are, in general, uncleanly in their manners.\n\nCommon hoopoe.—Variegated with blackish and rufous Epopteris; white, beneath; crest pale orange, tipped with black; tail black, with a white band; bill and legs black; irides hazel; back and wings with black and white lines; neck reddish-brown; crest of a double row of feathers; tail feathers 10. The weight of this beautiful bird is about three ounces, and the length 12 inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa; but only visits this country occasionally, in autumn, and is very seldom known to breed with us. The female is said to have two or three broods in the year. Seldom makes a nest; but lays her eggs, which are generally four or five, blueish-white, and marked with pale brown spots, in the hollow of a tree, and sometimes in a hole of a wall, or even on the ground. Its food consists chiefly of insects of the beetle tribe. It is a solitary bird, two of them being seldom seen together. In Egypt, where they abound, they are seen only in small flocks. Its crest usually falls behind on its neck, except when it is surprised or irritated, and then it stands erect; the tail, too, being, in that case, usually erected, and spread like a fan.\n\nGrand hoopoe, or grand promerops.—Black; head, neck, and breast, glossy green; scapular and lateral tail feathers falcated; tail very long. \"This most extraordinary and beautiful bird (observes Dr Latham), is near four feet in length, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail; the body is the size only of a middling pigeon, though much elongated in shape. The bill is three inches long, pretty much curved, and black; the head, hind part of the neck, and upper part of the belly, are of a shining green; the fore part of the neck, and lower part of the belly, without gloss; the scapular feathers are of a singular construction; the webs on one side of the shaft being exceeding short, and on the other of a great length; the shape of them falciform:\nthey are of a purplish black colour, with the ends, for three quarters of an inch, of a most brilliant gilded glory green, though some of them, in a different light, reflect a blue gloi; beneath each wing arises a thick tuft of feathers, eight inches and a half in length, and of a texture resembling the herring-bone ones in the greater bird of Paradise; and, besides these, on each side of the tail are five or six falconiform feathers, with unequal webs, as the scapulars, though not half so much curved; the colour half dusky, half-greenish brown; the last divided from the other colour, on each feather, in an oblique manner; the tail consists of 12 feathers, and is of an enormous length, the middle ones measuring no less than 28 inches; but each of the others shortens as it proceeds outwards, to the outer one of all, which is only five inches in length; the colour of all of them is blue-black, with a polished steel gloi in some lights; the legs are black.\" Dr Latham has annexed a coloured figure. Little else is known of this remarkable species, except that it inhabits New Guinea.\n\nRed-billed hoop.—Black green; belly black; tail wedged; first quill and lateral tail feathers spotted with white; bill and legs red; feathers of the head and neck silky, and somewhat downy. Fifteen inches long. Inhabits Asia and Africa. Figured by Latham.\n\nGen. 30. Certhia, Creeper.\n\nBill arched, slender, somewhat triangular, pointed; tongue various, though generally pointed; feet formed for walking.\n\nThe birds of this genus are spread over the globe. They live chiefly on insects; their nostrils are small; their tail is composed of 12 feathers; their feet are large, with a large back toe; their claws are long and hooked. Most of them have an acute tongue; though in some it is flattened at the point, in others ciliated, in a few tubular. There are a considerable number of species, of which only one is a native of Britain.\n\nCommon creeper—Gray; white beneath; quill feathers brown, ten of them with a white spot; head and neck brown, with black streaks; rump tawny; wing coverts varied brown and black; quill feathers dusky, tipped with white, edged and barred with tawny; breast and belly filvery; tail long, tawny, the feathers sloping off to a point. Weighs about two drams; length five inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Runs with great facility on all sides of small branches of trees, in search of insects and their eggs, which constitute its food. Except the crested wren, it is the smallest of British birds; and, though pretty common, is not seen without difficulty, from the ease with which, on the appearance of any one, it escapes to the opposite side of the tree. Its nest is composed of dry grass and the inner bark of wood, loosely put together, and lined with small feathers; and it is usually constructed in some hole, or behind the bark of a decayed tree. The eggs are from six to eight, white, and minutely speckled with bright rust colour. During incubation, the female is fed by the other sex. The note of the common creeper is weak, monotonous, and deliberately uttered, but rarely heard in winter.—In North America, is found a variety of a considerably larger size.\n\nHook-billed redcreeper.—Scarlet; wings and tail black; bill longer than the head, bent like a scimitar, whitish; legs and long claws blackish; tail feathers short, pointed; edges of the wings, and roots of the throat feathers white. This beautiful species inhabits the Sandwich islands, and is much used by the natives in their feathered drestes.\n\nMocking creeper.—Olive; crown inclining to violet; Sannio; spot on the cheeks white; wings and sublacked tail brown. Seven inches long. Inhabits New Zealand; has a very imitative voice, and laps the sweet moisture from the nectaries of flowers.\n\nCardinal creeper.—Black; head, neck, breast, and Cardinalis line down the middle of the back, red; tail even. Size of the common species. Inhabits the island of Tanna, and sucks the nectaries of flowers.\n\nWall creeper, or spider catcher.—Cinereous; wings Muraria with a tawny spot; bill fulvate, sharp edged, longer than the head; neck whitish beneath; quill feathers black; wings with a rosy spot; tail feathers whitish; claws strong, particularly the hind one. The chin and throat of the female are white. Size of a sparrow; length five inches eight lines. Inhabits southern Europe and Asia. Is solitary; feeds on insects, and has the same manners as the common creeper, except that it haunts ruined edifices, old walls, arches, &c., and is particularly fond of spiders. According to Scopoli, it migrates singly towards the end of autumn. Its flight is vague and uncertain, and it climbs by leaps. Builds frequently in holes of walls.\n\nLittle brown and white creeper.—Brown; white be-puffila; beneath; eyebrows white; tail feathers brown, the outer ones white at the tip; a black streak from the bill to the eyes; quill feathers edged with a buffy hue. Three inches and a half long. Inhabits India. Feeds on flies, and is fond of honey.\n\nBlue creeper, or certhia of Guiana.—Blue; band Cerulea across the eyes, chin, wings, and tail, black. Four inches long, and somewhat bigger than the common creeper. Makes its nest of dried stalks or grass, in the form of a retort, and open beneath, suspending it from the slender and extreme branches of trees, and thus securing it against the attacks of the monkey, snake, and lizard.—Varies, in having the bill and legs sometimes red.\n\nCollared creeper.—Glossy green; breast red, with a Chalybea-steel-blue bar on the fore-part. Four inches and a half long. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope; feeds on insects and the nectar of flowers, and sings sweetly.\n\nBlack and yellow creeper, yellow-bellied creeper, &c.—Flavolela.—Black; pale yellow beneath; eyebrows whitish; outer tail feathers tipped with white. The markings, however, vary considerably. From four to five inches long. Inhabits the West Indies, and feeds principally on the juice of the sugar cane, which it draws out by infusing its bill into any crevice or crack of the stalk.\n\nBraceletted creeper.—Green; wings, when folded, black above; beneath yellow; shoulders, bracelets on Plate the thighs, and spots on the rump, sapphire blue; bill CCCXCIV. black; legs yellowish; body beneath whitish-green; vent yellowish; quill feathers black, inner edge yellow. Length five inches. Native of Surinam.\n\nOrange-backed creeper.—Bluish-gray; spot on the Cantillans, back, and under parts of the body yellow; bill and legs black; irides red. Three inches long. Inhabits China, and is remarkable for the sweetness of its song.\nBeautiful creeper.—Two middle tail feathers very long; body glossy green; breast red; bill, legs, and tail feathers, blackish, the latter edged with gold; belly whitish; wings and greater coverts brown. Seven inches long. Inhabits Senegal.\n\nFamous creeper.—Two middle tail feathers very long; body glossy green; armpits yellow; lores black; bill, legs, claws, and tail black; a black line between the bill and eyes. Female green brown; yellowish beneath; breast green; two middle tail feathers shorter than in the male. Nine inches long. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nLoten's creeper.—Blue; bar on the breast gold-red; lores black; bill subulate, black, twice as long as the head; tongue compressed at the tip; head, neck, back, rump, and upper tail coverts sometimes blue, sometimes gold-green; breast, belly, and vent glossy black; in the female dirty white, spotted with black; wings black; lesser coverts violet; middle green; greater black; tail even. Upwards of five inches long. Inhabits Madagascar and Ceylon. Makes a cup-shaped nest, like that of a chattech, of the down of plants. The female generally lays five or six eggs. This species is sometimes chased by a very voracious spider, as large as itself, which seizes on the whole brood, and sucks the blood of the young birds.\n\nGen. 31. Trochilus, Humming bird.\n\nBill subulate, filiform, tubular at the tip, longer than the head; upper mandible sheathing the lower; tongue filiform, the two threads coalescing, and tubular; feet gressorial.\n\nThe birds of this species are very small, and, with a very few exceptions, inhabit South America. Their bill and feet are weak, their nostrils minute, and their tongue is capable of being darted far out. They fly very rapidly, take their food on the wing, sucking the honey juice of flowers, and sometimes also swallowing insects, the fragments of which have been found in their stomachs. They are bold, pugnacious, and gregarious, and make a louder noise by the motion of their wings than by their voice. They construct an elegant hemispherical nest of the down of a species of thistle, and suspend it from the branches of trees, where it is hid by the leaves, the female laying too white eggs of the size of peas, which are hatched by the alternate incubation of the male and female. These minute birds are taken by aspersing them with water from a syphon, as the finest shot would blow them to pieces. They are said to hibernate. The brilliancy of their colouring greatly exceeds the powers of painting and description. The green, red, and blue of their diminutive plumage is like beaten gold, and reflects the most beautiful splendor in sunshine.\n\nA. Bill curved.\n\nParadise humming bird.—Red; wings blue; head crested; middle tail feathers very long; bill and legs black; wing coverts blue. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits Mexico.\n\nLittle humming bird. Greenish-brown, with a scarlet gloss; wings and tail black; crest green at the base, tipped with gold; bill black. One inch and a half long. Inhabits Guiana.\n\nTopaz humming bird.—Red; middle tail feathers very long; head brown; chin gold-green; rump green; bill, head, and neck black; breast rosy; back and wing coverts orange red; quill and middle tail feathers purple; the rest orange. Female almost entirely green gold. Six inches long. Inhabits Surinam.\n\nMango humming bird.—Glossy green; tail nearly equal, and ferruginous; belly black; bill and legs black; a blue line dividing the colours of the back and belly; vent white; two middle tail feathers black. Four inches long. Inhabits Mexico, Brazil, and St Domingo. According to Albins, it is also found in Jamaica, building its nest of cotton in the physic-nut-tree, and laying two white eggs as big as peas. There are several varieties. Under this species, Dr Latham relates the following interesting particulars:\n\n\"We have before related a circumstance of the possibility of keeping humming birds alive for some time, by means of sugar and water; but this was in their own country and climate. In addition to this, we have been informed, on undoubted veracity, of the following fact: A young gentleman, a few days before he set sail from Jamaica to England, was fortunate enough to meet with a female humming bird, fitting on the nest and eggs; when, cutting off the twig, he brought all together on board the ship; the female became sufficiently tame, so as to suffer itself to be fed with honey, and during the passage hatched two young ones; however, the mother did not survive long, but the young were brought to England, and continued alive for some time in the possession of Lady Hammond. Sir H. Englefield, Baronet, and Colonel Sloane, both witnesses of the circumstance, informed me that these little creatures readily took honey from the lips of Lady Hammond, with their bills: one of them did not live long, but the other survived at least two months from the time of its arrival.\"\n\nB. Bill straight.\n\nRed-throated humming bird.—Green-gold; tail feathers black, the three lateral ones ferruginous, tipped with white; chin flame colour; bill black; chin scarlet, with a beautiful gold gloss. The female brown above, whitish beneath; tail subequal, rusty at the base, and tipped with white. Three inches and one fourth long. Inhabits America, as far north as Canada. This beautiful little creature flies so swiftly, that the eye is incapable of pursuing it, and the motion of its wings is so rapid as to be imperceptible to the nicest observer. It never feeds but on the wing, suspended over the flower from which it extracts its nourishment. Like the bee, having exhausted the honeyed juice of one flower, it wanders to the next, in search of new sweets. It is most partial to those flowers which have the deepest nectaries: and, in the countries which these birds inhabit, whoever sets plants of this description before his window, may depend on being visited by multitudes of them. It is very entertaining to see them swarming around the flowers, and trying every tube by thrusting in their bills. If they find that their companions have anticipated them, and robbed the flower of its honey, they will frequently, in a fit of rage, pluck it off, and throw it on the ground, or even tear it in pieces. Numbers will sometimes contend very fiercely for the possession of the same flower. During the conflict, they frequently pursue the fugitives into the apartments of those houses whose windows are left...\nleft open, take a turn round the room as flies do with us, and then suddenly regain the open air. When feeding, they will allow persons to come within two yards of them; but, on a nearer approach, they dart off with wonderful swiftness. The red-throated humming bird most frequently builds on the middle of a branch of a tree, and the nest is so small, that it cannot be seen by a person who stands on the ground. It is quite round, the outside, for the most part, composed of the green moss common on old pales and trees, and the inside of the softest vegetable down which the birds can collect. Sometimes, however, they vary the texture, using flax, hemp, hairs, and other similar materials. They are sometimes, likewise, known to fix it on some low bush, on a stalk of the tobacco plant, or even on the side of a pod of oca (Hiliscus efeulentus, Lin.). The female lays two eggs, which are white, and equal in thickness at both ends. When these birds observe any one climbing the tree in which they have their nests, they attack him in the face, attempting to strike him in the eyes, and coming, going, and returning, with such swiftness, that one would scarcely credit it who had not seen it himself. This species, like the others of its genus, is seldom caught alive. A friend of Monsieur du Pratz had, however, this pleasure. He had observed one of them enter into the bell of a convolvulus; and, as it had quite buried itself to get at the bottom, he ran immediately to the spot, hit the flower, cut it from the stalk, and carried off the bird a prisoner. He could not, however, prevail upon it to eat; and it died in the course of two or three days. Charlevoix informs us, that he had one of them in Canada, for about twenty-four hours. It suffered itself to be handled, and even counterfeited death, that it might escape; but it fell a real sacrifice to a flight from daring the night. \"My friend Captain Davies informs me,\" says Dr Latham, \"that he kept these birds alive for four months by the following method:—He made an exact representation of some of the tubular flowers, with paper fastened round a tobacco pipe, and painted them of a proper colour. These were placed in the order of nature, in the cage in which the little creatures were confined: the bottoms of the tubes were filled with a mixture of brown sugar and water as often as emptied; and he had the pleasure of feeding them perform every action; for they soon grew familiar, and took their nourishment in the same manner as when ranging at large, though close under the eye.\"\n\nRuby-necked humming bird.—Green-gold; tail even and ferruginous, the two outer feathers tipped with brown; wings black; bill and legs blackish; crown, hind head, and neck ruby; body brown beneath. Female whitish-gray beneath, with a gold spot on the breast and throat. Upwards of three inches long. Inhabits Guiana, Brazil, and Surinam. Reputed the most beautiful of the tribe.\n\nWhite-bellied humming bird.—Tail feathers black, the lateral ones white; head blue; back green; belly white. Above four inches long. Inhabits Surinam. Edwards remarks, that the whole of the plumage, in the sun, seems as if mixed with threads of gold.\n\nLegless humming bird.—Green; whitish beneath; lateral tail feathers white on the outer edge; bill and legs blackish; wings violet brown; tail feathers bluish-black, the primary totally gray; secondary gray from the middle to the tip. Female dirty greenish-brown, whitish beneath. Inhabits South America, and some of the West India islands. The leaf of all known birds; being hardly an inch and a quarter in length, and weighing from twenty to forty-five grains; thus being surpassed in weight and dimensions by more than one species of bee. The female is even less than the male.\n\nOrder III. ANSERES.\n\nBill somewhat obtuse, covered with a skin, gibbous at the base; mouth toothed; tongue fleshy; feet palmarated, and formed for swimming.\n\nMost of the birds belonging to this order dwell much in the water. Their feet and legs are short, concealed under the feathers, and placed more behind than in other birds. Their toes are short, and generally compressed, so that they easily cleave the water, and by means of their membranes or webs, form, as it were, broad oars. Their plumage is thicker, closer, and better furnished with down than that of other birds. The gland which all birds have at the rump, and from which they express an oily matter to preserve their feathers moist, is most considerable in the anseres, and contributes to make their plumage impermeable to water. They feed on fish, aquatic animals, and plants. In general they are polygamous, and make their nests among reeds, or in moist places. The young are soon able to seek their own food; yet the mother leads and protects them for some time, and the male frequently kills them. For the most part they lay many eggs; and the flesh of many is eatable, though it frequently favours of oil, or of fish.\n\nGen. 32. Anas.\n\nBill convex, obtuse, the edges divided into lamellated teeth; tongue fringed and obtuse; the three fore toes connected, the hind one solitary.\n\nThis is a very numerous genus, and includes swans, geese, and ducks.\n\nA. Bill gibbous at the base.\n\nWild swan, hoopoe, elk, whistling swan, &c.—Bill cylindrical, and black; cere yellow; body white; eyelids naked, yellow; legs black; ribs eleven. This is obviously a distinct species from the common or mute swan, being of a smaller size, and having the windpipe differently constructed. It weighs from fifteen to twenty-five pounds, and measures nearly five feet in length. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, affecting chiefly the northern regions of the globe, and seldom appearing in England, except in hard winters. On the approach of spring, they quit their southern stations, and again retire northward to breed. A few indeed drop short, and perform that office by the way, halting in some of the Hebrides, Orkneys, Shetland, or some solitary island. But the great bodies of this species occur on the large rivers and lakes near Hudson's bay, and those of Kamtschatka, Lapland, and Iceland. They are said to return to the latter place in flocks of about a hundred at a time, in spring; and also to pour in on that island from the north, in nearly the same manner, on their way southward, toward the close of autumn, flying very high in the air, and in such a compact body, that the bill of one touches the tail of another. The young, which\nare bred there, remain throughout the first year; and in August, when they lose their feathers, and are unable to fly, the natives kill them with clubs, shoot, and hunt them down with dogs, by which they are easily caught. The flesh is highly esteemed, as are the eggs, which are gathered in the spring. The Icelanders, Kamtchatkaldes, and other inhabitants of the northern world, dress their skins with the down on them, sew them together, and convert them into various sorts of garments. The northern American Indians have recourse to the same expedient for clothing themselves, and sometimes weave the down as barbers do the caws for wigs, and then manufacture it into ornamental draperies for the women of rank, while the larger feathers are formed into caps and plumes, to decorate the heads of their chieftains and warriors. They likewise gather the feathers and down in large quantities, and barter or sell them to the inhabitants of more civilized nations. Notwithstanding the fabulous accounts and poetical descriptions of the song of the dying Iwan, its voice is shrill, harsh, and piercing, not unlike the sound of a clarionet, when blown by a novice in music. It is asserted, however, by those who have heard the united and varied voices of a numerous assemblage of them, that they produce a more harmonious effect, particularly when softened by the murmur of the waters. At the setting in of frosty weather, wild swans are said to associate in prodigious multitudes, and, thus united, to use every effort to prevent the water from freezing; which they are enabled to accomplish for a considerable length of time, by constantly flapping and dashing it with their extended wings. The wild Iwan has been styled \"the peaceful monarch of the lake,\" because, conscious of his superior strength, he fears no enemy, nor suffers any bird, however powerful, to molest him, at the same time that he preys on none of the feathered tribe. His vigorous wing thwarts him against the attacks even of the eagle, and his blows from it are so powerful, as to stun or kill the fiercest of his foes. His food consists of the grasses and weeds, and the seeds and roots of plants which grow on the margins of the water, and of the myriad insects which skim over or float on its surface; occasionally, too, of the slimy inhabitants within its bosom. The female makes her nest of the withered leaves and stalks of reeds and rushes, and commonly lays six or seven thick-shelled, white eggs. The incubation is said to last six weeks. Both male and female are very attentive to their young, and will suffer no enemy to approach them.\n\nTame Iwan.—Bill femicylindrical, black; cere black; body white. The plumage of this species is of the same snowy whiteness as that of the preceding, and the bird is covered next the body with the same kind of fine soft down; but it is of a larger size, and is furnished with a projecting, callous, black nubecle, or knob, at the base of the upper mandible. But the most remarkable distinction consists in the conformation of the windpipe, which, in the present species, enters at once into the lungs, so that the utmost noise the bird can utter, is a mere hiss; whereas, in the wild species, the windpipe first enters the chest a little way, is then reflected in the form of a trumpet; after which it enters a second time, when, dividing into two branches, it goes on to join the lungs. The manners and habits of both species in the wild state are very similar. The beauty, graceful motion, and majesty of this bird, when it is wafted along a piece of water, attract the admiration of every beholder: but, out of the liquid element, the elegance of its form in a great measure disappears. While the male and female are employed with the cares of the young brood, it is not safe to approach them; for they will fly on a stranger, and sometimes beat him to the ground by repeated blows. Notwithstanding, however, their great strength of wing, a flight blow on the head will dispatch them. Multitudes of this species are found in Russia and Siberia, as well as farther southward, in a wild state. They occur, without an owner, on the Trent, on the inlet of the sea, near Abbotbury in Dorsetshire, and on some other rivers and lakes, in different parts of the British isles. Those on the Thames have, for ages, been protected as royal property; and it is still reckoned felony to steal their eggs. In former times great numbers were reared for the table; but they are now reckoned by most a coarse kind of food. A fattened cygnet, however, is still accounted a great delicacy, and usually fetches upwards of a guinea in the poultry market. It is generally believed that the swan lives to a great age, though the term of three centuries, assigned to it by some authors, is certainly much exaggerated. The female needles among the rough herbage near the water's edge, lays from six to eight large white eggs, and sits on them about as many weeks before they are hatched. The young do not acquire their full plumage till the second year. If kept out of the water, and confined to a court-yard, the swan soon becomes dirty, dull, and spiritless. Its usual food consists of fish and water plants.\n\nBlack Iwan.—Black; wings edged with white; bill Atatra. red; upper mandible blackish at the tip, a yellow spot near the lip; legs black; feet paler. Extent of wing four feet eight inches. Inhabits various parts of New Holland; but little is known respecting its manners.\n\nSnow goose.—Body snow-white; front yellowish; ten Hybergoe first quill feathers black; bill and legs red. Size of a Ica. goose; length two feet eight inches; extent of wing three feet and a half; weight between five and six pounds. Great numbers of this species occur about Hudson's bay; visit Severn river in May, and stay a fortnight, but go farther north to breed. They return to Severn Port about the beginning of September, and stay till the middle of October, when they depart for the south, and are observed in immense flocks attended by their young. At this time many thousands are killed by the inhabitants, who pluck and evicerate them, and put them into holes in the earth, where they are preserved quite free by frost, throughout the severe season. These birds seem also to occupy the west side of America and Kamtchatka. In the summer months they are plentiful on the arctic coast of Siberia; but never migrate beyond 130° of longitude. They are supposed to pass the winter in more moderate climes, as they have been seen flying over Silesia; probably on their passage to some other country, as it does not appear that they continue there. Those of America, in like manner, winter in Carolina. The Siberians decoy them by a person covered with a white skin, and crawling on all fours, whom they are stupid enough to mistake for their leader, and whom they follow, when driven by men in their rear, till he entangles them in nets, or leads them into a sort of pond prepared for the purpose.\n\nAntarctic goose.—Snowy; bill black; legs yellow. Antarctica.\nThe female has the tail flesh coloured, and the body brown, with transverse white lines. From twenty-four to twenty-six inches long. Inhabits Falkland islands.\n\n**Bufflehead goose.**—White; two middle tail feathers, primary quill feathers, and greater wing coverts, black; nape, and upper part of the back, with numerous black lines; wings with a blunt spine at the flexure, and a dusky green spot; greater wing coverts tipped with white; secondary quill feathers half black, half white; legs black. This is the sea-goose of Clayton, and the white-winged antarctic goose of Brown. It measures from thirty-two to forty inches in length, stands pretty high on its legs, walks and flies with great ease, and has not that disagreeable cackling cry peculiar to the rest of its kind. It generally lays six eggs; and its flesh is reckoned wholesome, nourishing, and palatable. Inhabits the Falkland islands.\n\n**Loggerhead goose, or racehorse duck.**—Cinerous; dusky beneath; vent white; wings and tail short and black; bill, irides, and tubercle on the wings and legs yellow. Length thirty-two inches; weighs from twenty to thirty pounds. Observed on Falkland islands, Staten Land, &c.; mostly in pairs, though sometimes in large flocks. From the shortness of their wings, they were unable to fly, but they used them in the water as oars, and swam so rapidly, that it was very difficult to shoot them when on that element. In order to catch them, the sailors would surround a flock with boats and drive them on shore, where, unable to raise themselves from the ground, they ran very fast; but soon growing tired, and squatting down to rest, were easily overtaken and knocked on the head. Their flesh, however, was not much relished, being rank and filthy.\n\n**Sheldrake, or burrow duck.**—Bill turning up at the point; forehead compressed; head greenish-black; body white and variegated; bill and legs red; head and neck violet; collar white; back white; breast brown; belly white, with a black line; first quill feathers black, the next violet, inner ones ferruginous, the last white; tail white, tip with black. The female has less vivid colours. This elegant species of duck weighs about two pounds and a half, and measures about two feet three inches. It inhabits Europe and Asia, and is not uncommon on many parts of our coasts, remaining all the year. The female makes choice of a rabbit-burrow, wherein to deposit her eggs, which are numerous, amounting sometimes to fifteen, and which she covers with down from her own body. The nest is generally near the water, whether the female leads her young soon after they are hatched. This species is rarely met with remote from salt water; but if the eggs are taken, and hatched under a hen, the young become tame, and may be kept in ponds. They very seldom breed when in a state of confinement. Their principal food consists of sea-weeds, small shell-fish, and marine insects. The flesh is rancid.\n\n**Velvet duck.**—Blackish; lower eyelid, and spot on the wings, white; bill yellow, black in the middle, gibbous at the base; legs red. Female without the gibbosity on the bill, and body blackish. From 20 to 22 inches long. Inhabits Europe and South America. It is sometimes, though not often, seen on our coasts in winter. Frequent Hudson's bay, where it breeds in summer; and is not uncommon in Russia and Siberia. Lives on fuci and shell-fish. The female makes its nest of grass, and lays from four to ten white eggs. The catching of this species is a favourite diversion of the Tunguiti, who dwell on the river Ochota, and who chase great numbers of these birds, during the moulting season, into shallow water, and then knock them down with clubs. They take many of them alive, and, thrusting a needle through their eyes, carry fifty or more on a string. It is alleged that the birds, thus treated, will live for two or even three days.\n\n**Scooter, or black diver.**—Body quite black; bill gibbose at the base; head and neck sprinkled with purple; tail somewhat wedged. Female of a browner hue, and without the protuberance at the base of the bill. Length 22 inches; feeds on grats and shell-fish, and taints rancid. These birds inhabit Europe and North America, and mostly reside at sea, distant from the shore. With us they are seen only in the winter season, when they are plentiful on some parts of the coast of France. They are great divers, and abound in most of the northern regions of the world. They want the horny nail at the end of the bill, which is common to the rest of the genus. As they taste strongly of fish, they are allowed by the Romish church to be eaten in Lent.\n\n**White-fronted, or laughing goose.**—Brown; white, Albinos; spotted with black beneath; front and rump white; bill and legs flame colour. Breast cinereous; tail dusky, edged with white. Two feet four inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, and visits the fenney parts of England, in small flocks, in winter. During severe weather it is killed on the coast as well as on rivers, and not uncommonly brought to market and sold for the common wild goose. It leaves us in the earliest spring, none being seen after the middle of March.\n\n**B. Bill equal at the base.**\n\n**Scaup duck.**—Black; shoulders waved with ash colour; belly and spot on the wings white; bill broad, bluish-ash; irides yellow; head and neck greenish-black; back and wing coverts waved with black, and cinereous; legs and primary quill-feathers dusky; secondaries white, tipped with black; tail coverts, and vent, black. Female brown; bill black, surrounded with a circle of white feathers; neck rusty; belly, and bar on the wings, white; legs black. From 18 to 20 inches long; feeds on shell-fish, and inhabits Europe, northern Asia, and America. It is found in Iceland, Lapland, Sweden, Norway, Russia, and Siberia, and as high as Hudson's bay in America. In England, it appears in the winter season, in small flocks, and is frequently observed in fresh waters. In October it begins to emigrate southward in flocks. It also frequently lives in holes under ground.\n\n**Gray lag goose, or wild goose.**—Bill femicylindrical; body cinereous above, paler beneath; neck striated; bill flesh-coloured and tipped with white; rump and vent white; legs flesh-coloured; claws black, wants the wing spot. Weighs eight or nine pounds, and is about 33 inches long. Varies much in colour by domestication, in which state it is our common tame goose. Inhabits in flocks the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and America; resides the whole year in the Lincolnshire fens, where it breeds, laying eight or nine eggs which are hatched in 28 or 30 days. Frequent lakes and rivers, and lives to a great age. The domestic goose is well known. It is bred in great multitudes in the fens of Lincolnshire, both on account of its flesh and feathers. The geese are there attended by a person called...\na goszard, who drives them to feed and water. They are plucked five times a year, once for quills and feathers, and four times for feathers only. If the fowl prove cold, many of them die by this cruel operation. Tame geese have been known to live for 80 years. They generally retain the white rump and vent feathers of their original stock. They feed on water insects, worms, and plants; and by means of two rows of strong sharp teeth within their bills, they crop the herbage in meadows, and do much injury to young corn.\n\nRed-breasted goose.—Black; white beneath; bill small, conical; neck rufous; spot between the bill and eyes white. Length 21 inches; weight about three pounds. Inhabits Russia and the northern parts of Siberia, but is very rarely found in England. In winter it migrates towards Persia. It is a beautiful species, and its flesh is in high request.\n\nBean goose.—Cinerous; dirty white beneath; bill compressed at the base; tail-coverts white; legs saffron; bill reddish in the middle, black at the base and tip; head and neck inclining to ferruginous; quill-feathers edged with black; tail with white; claws white. Measures from two feet and a half to three feet in length, and weighs from five to seven pounds. Inhabits Hudson's bay and the Hebrides, particularly the isle of Lewis, where it remains all summer and breeds. These birds migrate to England in autumn, and leave it again in May, lighting, on their passage, on corn fields, and feeding on the green wheat. In their migration they fly at a great height, sometimes in a straight line, and sometimes in the form of a wedge, cackling as they advance. This species is often killed, and sold for the common wild goose, with which it has been long confused.\n\nGarland duck.—Bill narrow; head green; breast and belly white. Inhabits the fens of Iceland, but is very rare.\n\nBernacle goose.—Ash-coloured; front white; body waved with black and white above; neck black; belly white; bill short, black, with a flesh-coloured spot on each side, a black spot between the bill and eye; tail white beneath; legs blackish. Twenty-five inches long. Inhabits the north of Europe and Hudson's bay, and appears in large flocks on the north-west coasts of Britain during winter. They are then very wild and shy; but, on being taken, become quite familiar in a few days. In February they quit our shores, and retire as far as Lapland, Greenland, and even Spitzbergen to breed. In the darker ages this species was seriously believed to be produced from the lepas anatifa, a shell which is often found adhering by a pedicle to logs of wood that have lain long in the sea, from which circumstance it obtained the name of tree-goose and clakis.\n\nBrent, or brand-goose.—Brown; head, neck, and breast, black; collar white; bill, wings, tail and legs, black; broad spot on each side of the neck; tail-coverts and vent white; belly and shoulders cinereous; flanks streaked with white; considerably smaller than the preceding. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and North America. These birds appear on our coasts, particularly in the west of England, during winter, and in Shetland are called horra geese. But they are most plentiful in Ireland, where they are taken in nets placed across the rivers, especially in those which empty themselves into the northern parts of the Irish channel. Sometimes they appear in vast flocks on the coast of Picardy, destroying all the corn near the sea. They migrate northward in summer, and return south in autumn, flying high in wedge-shaped flocks. They feed on polygonum viviparum, empetrum nigrum, and other plants, but chiefly on aquatic plants and marine vermes. They are easily tamed, and reckoned good for the table.\n\nEider, eider, or Cuthbert duck.—Bill cylindrical; mouth large, wrinkled, and bifid on the hind part; bill, legs, front, ocular band, breast, lower part of the back and belly black; middle of the head, upper part of the back, shoulders and wing-coverts white; a green blotch beneath the hind head. The female almost wholly obscurely ferruginous, with black lines; tail and primary quill-feathers dusky. The young are not mature in plumage till the third, or perhaps the fourth year. This species is nearly double the size of the common duck, and about 22 inches long. It inhabits the high latitudes of Europe, Asia, and America, and feeds chiefly on testaceous animals. It is rarely, if ever, seen in the south of England, but breeds in the north of Scotland, particularly on the western isles, as also on the Faroe islands, on the coast of Northumberland, in June and July. The nest is made on the ground, composed of marine plants, and lined with down of exquisite fineness which the female plucks from her own body. The eggs are usually five, and of a greenish colour. In Iceland the eider ducks generally build their nests on small islands not far from the shore, and sometimes even near the dwellings of the natives, who treat them with so much attention and kindness as to render them nearly tame. Two females will sometimes lay their eggs in the same nest, in which case they always agree remarkably well. As long as the female is fitting, the male continues on watch near the shore, but as soon as the young are hatched, he leaves them. The mother, however, remains with them a considerable time afterwards; and it is curious to observe her attention in leading them out of the nest almost as soon as they creep from the eggs. Having conducted them to the water's edge, she takes them on her back and swims a few yards with them, when she dives, and leaves them on the surface to take care of themselves. They are seldom afterwards seen on land. When the natives come to the nest, they carefully remove the female, and take away the superfluous down and eggs. They then replace the mother, and she begins to lay afresh, covering the eggs with new down; and when she can afford no more, the male comes to her assistance, and covers the eggs with his down, which is white. When the young ones leave the nest, which is about an hour after they are hatched, it is once more plundered. The best down and most eggs are got during the first three weeks of their laying; and it has generally been observed that they lay the greatest number of eggs in rainy weather. One female, during the time of laying, usually yields half a pound of down, which, however, is reduced one half after it is cleaned. When pure, it is sold in Lapland at the rate of two rixdollars a pound. It is extremely soft and warm, and so light and elastic, that a couple of handfuls, squeezed together, are sufficient to fill a covering like a feather bed, which is used in those cold countries instead of a common quilt or blanket. The Iceland company at Copenhagen, generally export every year...\nyear from 1500 to 2000 pounds weight of down, cleaned and uncleaned, exclusive of what is privately exported by foreigners. The Greenlanders kill these birds with darts, pursuing them in their little boats, watching their course by the air-bubbles when they dive, and always striking at them when they rise wearied to the surface. Their flesh is valued as food, and their skins are made into warm and comfortable under garments.\n\n**Mufcovy duck.**—Face naked, with red caruncles; legs and orbits naked, and with the bill red; tip of the bill and space round the nostrils black; crown black; temples, chin, and throat white, varied with black; breast and lower part of the belly brown, mixed with white; back and rump brown, with a green gold gloss; upper part of the belly white; three first quill-feathers white, the rest brown; tail feathers twenty, the outer white, the rest green gold. Two feet long; native of Brazil, and is domesticated in Europe. Has its name, not as vulgarly alleged, from the country of Mufcovy, but from the circumstances of its smelling of musk, which arises from the liquor secreted in the gland of the rump. Like other domesticated fowls they are subject to great varieties. They are a thriving and prolific species, and not only afficiate, but sometimes breed with the common duck. Their flesh is much esteemed. Mr Pennant says they are met with wild about Lake Baikal in Asia; Ray, that they are natives of Louisiana, Marckgrave, that they reside in Brazil, and Buffon, that they occur in the overflowed savannas of Guiana, where they feed in the daytime on the wild rice, and return in the evening to the sea. He adds, that they nestle on the trunks of rotten trees, and that after the young are hatched, the mother takes them, one after another, by the bill, and throws them into the water. Great numbers of the young brood are said to be destroyed by the alligators.\n\n**Shoemaker.**—Extremity of the bill dilated, rounded, with an incurved nail; bill black; irides yellow; head and neck violet green; breast white, and immaculate; back, wings, and wedged-tail brown; belly chestnut; vent white; first and second wing coverts pale blue, greater brown, tipped with white, the rest edged with white; legs tawny. The female has a considerable resemblance to the common duck, but both sexes are very apt to vary in their colourings. This species inhabits Europe, Asia, and North America, but is by no means common in Britain. A few remain in France during the breeding season, making a nest of rushes in which they lay 10 or 12 rufous-coloured eggs.\n\n**Red-breasted shoemaker.**—Brown; chin and breast chestnut; wings tipped with gray, wing-spot purple, edged with white; tail short, white; bill broad, brownish yellow; head large; eyes small; irides yellow; legs small, slender, and bay. Size of a tame duck. Sometimes found in the fens of Lincolnshire, but is rare, and little known.\n\n**Ural duck.**—Waved with cinereous and yellowish, and spotted with brown; brown, speckled with gray beneath; throat brown-yellow, waved with black; tail long, black, wedged. Rather bigger than the common teal. Is not unfrequent in the greater lakes of the Ural mountains, and the rivers Ob and Irtish. Is not seen on the ground, being, from the situation of its legs, unable to walk; but it swims well and quickly, with the tail immersed in the water as far as the rump, and steering as a rudder, contrary to the common method of a duck's swimming. The nest is formed of reeds.\n\n**Gadwall, or gray.**—Wing-spot rufous, black, and white; bill flat, black; legs tawny; rump black; back brown, waved with paler; breast and belly gray, varied with white. Nineteen inches long. Inhabits Europe and Northern Asia, visits Britain in winter, but not in great numbers. Supposed to breed in Sweden, and probably in Russia and Siberia. It is said to be a great diver, and to feed chiefly by night, concealing itself among the reeds and rushes during the day. It makes a note not unlike that of the mallard, but louder. Its flesh is savoury.\n\n**Golden eye.**—Black and white; head turned; violet; a large white spot at each corner of the mouth; bill black; irides golden; lower part of the neck, breast, and belly, white; back and rump black; legs red. The markings of the female are, head red brown; neck gray; breast and belly white; wing coverts varied with dusky and cinereous; middle quill-feathers white; the rest and tail black; legs dusky. About 19 inches in length. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nBirds of this species do not assemble in large flocks, nor are they numerous on the British shores or on the lakes in the interior. They are late in taking their departure northward in the spring, and in their flight they make the air whistle with the vigorous quick strokes of their wings. They are excellent divers, and seldom set foot on shore; on which, it is said, they walk with great apparent difficulty, and, except in the breeding season, only repair to it for the purpose of taking their repose. They build in the hollows of trees, and prey on shell-fish, mice, fish, and frogs.\n\nThe *anas glaucion*, or *musillon*, seems to be only a variety of the golden eye in one stage of its plumage, before it arrives at maturity.\n\n**Bimaculated, or clucking duck.**—Subcrested; brown, waved with black; head green; a ferruginous spot before and behind the eyes; breast with black spots; wing-spot green, edged with white. Length 20 inches; occurs along the Lena, and about Lake Baikal, and has been taken in a decoy in England. Has a singular note, somewhat like clucking.\n\n**Wigeon, whiever, or whin.**—Tail pointed; vent feathers black; head bay; front white; back waved with black and white; bill plumbous, with a black nail; head and upper part of the neck red, with blackish spots; breast claret; body above waved with cinereous and blackish; wing-spot blue-green; black before and behind; wing-coverts varied brown and white; belly white; legs lead-colour. Female waved with brown; breast paler. Twenty inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. Visits England in autumn, when great numbers are taken in decoys, being esteemed an excellent food. It likewise frequents our rivers and salt-water inlets in small flocks. It is remarkable for uttering a whistling or piping noise, which is frequently heard as it flies during the night. It lives on frogs, worms, insects, and water plants, and is sometimes domesticated. There is a variety with a filivery wing-spot, and the throat waved with ash-colour.\n\n**Pin-tail duck.**—Tail pointed, long, black beneath; hind head with a white line on each side; back waved with cinereous; bill black, bluish at the sides; head ferruginous; throat white, a little spotted; body white beneath;\nneath; wings brown; wing spot violet, ferruginous on the fore-part, black and white on the hind-part; tail brown, edged with white, two middle feathers longer. Female less; wing-spot straw-coloured, and edged with white. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. These birds are seldom numerous in England, but flocks of them are sometimes abundantly spread along the isles and shores of Scotland and Ireland, and on the interior lakes of both these countries. This species measures twenty-eight inches in length, and is esteemed excellent eating.\n\nFerruginous duck.—Reddish-brown; bill dilated and rounded at the base; feet pale blue. Weight 20 ounces. Inhabits Denmark and Sweden, but very rarely occurs in this country.\n\nLong-tailed duck.—Tail pointed, long; body black, white beneath; bill black, orange in the middle; head on the fore-part and sides reddish-gray; hind-part, breast, and belly, white; speculums long and white; sides of the neck with a black spot; lower part of the breast, back, wings, and tail, chocolate; four middle tail-feathers black, two middle ones longer, the rest white; legs dusky-red, or blackish. The female has the tail shorter and wedged; the body varied with blackish, rufous, and gray; the back black; collar and lower part of the belly white. Of the size of a wigeon. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, frequenting both the interior lakes and the sea shores of these quarters of the world. The birds of this species, do not, in the winter, like many of the other tribes, entirely quit their northern haunts, but considerable numbers remain there, enduring the rigours of the season, and enjoying, in summer, the perpetual day of an unletting sun. Numerous flocks, however, spread themselves southward in the winter, from Greenland and Hudson's bay, as far as New York in America, and from Iceland and Spitzbergen over Lapland, the Russian dominions, Sweden, Norway, and the northern parts of the British isles in Europe. The flocks which visit the Orkney isles appear in October, and continue there till April. About fifteen they are seen in large companies going to and returning from the bays, in which they frequently pass the night, making such a noise, as in frosty weather may be heard some miles. They are rather scarce in England, to which they resort only in very hard winters, and even then in small straggling parties. They fly swiftly, but seldom to a great distance, making a loud and singular cry. They are expert divers, and supposed to live chiefly on shell-fish. The female makes her nest among the grass near the water, and, like the eider duck, lines it with the fine down of her own body. According to Latham, she lays five eggs, which are of a bluish white colour, and about the size of those of a pullet.\n\nPochard, or red-headed wigeon.—Waved with ash-colour; head brown; pectoral band; vent and rump black; bill broad, blue, tipped with black; irides tawny; head and neck grey; breast and upper part of the back black; speculums and inner wing-coverts undulated with black and white; belly whitish, with dusky lines at the sides; legs plumbeous. Female darker; head pale reddish-brown; wing-coverts and belly cinereous. Nineteen inches long; weight 28 ounces. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. This species is frequently caught in the decoys in England, though it is not known to breed there. In some counties it is called pocher, dunbird, or green-headed wigeon. It is of a plump round shape, walks with a waddling and ungraceful step, but flies rapidly, and in flocks of from 20 to 40, commonly in a compact body. It is much in request for the table, but is not easily domesticated. The male has a labyrinth, or enlargement of the trachea, near the junction with the lungs, a singular conformation peculiar to the male of several species of the duck tribe, but the use of which is still unknown. In winter the pochard migrates southward, as far, it is said, as Egypt.\n\nGarganey.—Wing-spot green; a white line above the eyes; bill lead-colour; crown dusky with oblong streaks; cheeks and neck purple, with white streaks; breast light brown, with semicircular black bars; belly white, lower part and vent speckled; first quill-feathers cinereous, outer webs of the middle ones green; speculums long, narrow, striped with white, dull-colour and black; tails dusky; legs lead-colour. Female, with an obscure white mark over the eye; plumage brownish; wings without the green spot. Length 17 inches. Inhabits Europe and Asia. By some called pied wigeon, or summer teal. Frequent only the fresh waters, feeding on seeds and aquatic plants. Is not common in Britain, and is said to be impatient of cold.\n\nTeal.—Wing-spot green; a white line above and beneath the eyes; bill black; irides hazel; head and neck bright bay; a broad, green band behind the eyes to the nape, and terminating beneath in a white line; body whitish, with transverse blackish lines above; fore-part of the neck and breast with round black spots; wing-spot green, edged beneath with white, obliquely black above; vent black in the middle. The female is distinguished by the head and neck varied with whitish and brown, and the vent totally white. There are two permanent varieties, of which the first has the wing-spot varying in colour; the body brown-ash above, rufous-white beneath, and black spots on the belly. The second has the cheek, chin, and under parts of the body white-rufous, and the wing-spot without black. Weight about 12 ounces; length 14 inches and a half. The smallest of the duck tribe, and in high request at the table. Inhabits Europe and Asia; visits us in winter, and frequents our fresh waters in small flocks. Many are caught in the decoys, and a few breed in Wolmer Forest, in the marshes about Carlisle, &c. The female makes a large nest composed of soft dried grasses lined with feathers, and cunningly concealed in a hole among the roots of reeds and bulrushes, near the edge of the water. The eggs are of the size of those of a pigeon, from six to ten in number, and of a dull white colour marked with small brownish spots. The male has a bony labyrinth in the lower part of the windpipe.\n\nMallard, or wild duck.—Cinereous; middle tail-feathers (of the male) recurved; bill straight; collar white; bill greenish-yellow; head and neck glossy-green; speculums white, with waved brown lines; back brown; vent black-green; breast chestnut; belly grey; wing-spot violet-green, edged above with a black and white line; two middle tail feathers dark green, and recurved. Female reddish-brown, spotted with black. Very subject to vary, especially by domestication, when it is our common tame duck. About 23 inches long. Weight about two pounds and a half. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America; is very common in marshy places in many\nAnferees. ny parts of this kingdom, but no where occurs in greater plenty than in Lincolnshire, where prodigious numbers are annually taken in the decoys. In only ten decoys in the neighbourhood of Wainfleet, as many as 31,200 have been taken in one season. There is a prohibition, by act of parliament, against taking them between the first of June and the first of October. They do not always build their nests close to the water, but often at a good distance from it, in which case the female will take the young in her beak, or between her legs to the water. They have sometimes been known to lay their eggs in a high tree, in the deserted nest of a magpie or crow; and an instance has likewise been recorded of one found at Etchingham in Sussex, fitting on nine eggs in an oak, at the height of 25 feet from the ground, the eggs being supported by some small twigs laid crossways. Like many of the tribe, the mallards, in vast numbers quit the north at the end of autumn, and migrating southward, arrive in the beginning of winter in large flocks, and spread themselves over the lakes and marshy wastes of the British isles. They pair in the spring, when the greater number of them again retire northward to breed, but many straggling pairs stay with us; and they, as well as preceding colonists, remain to rear their young, which become natives, and remain with us throughout the year. The common domestic variety of this species affumes very different markings; but the male, even in its tame state, retains the curling of the feathers at the tail. Habits of domestication, however, have deprived the tame duck of that sprightly look and shape which distinguishes the mallard, and have substituted a more dull and less elegant form and appearance in their stead. It is also deserving of remark, that ducks pair, and are monogamous in the wild state, but become polygamous when tame. The Chinese make great use of ducks, but prefer the tame to the wild. We are told that most of them in that country are hatched by artificial heat. The eggs being laid in boxes of sand, are placed on a brick hearth, to which is communicated a proper degree of heat during the time required for hatching. The ducklings are fed with cray-fish and crabs, boiled and cut small, and afterwards mixed with boiled rice; and in about a fortnight they are able to shift for themselves. The proprietors then provide them with an old step-mother, who leads them where they are to find provender; being first put on board a boat, which is destined for their habitation, and from which the whole flock, amounting often to 300 or 400, go out to feed, and return at command. This method is commonly practised during the nine warmest months of the year, and especially during rice harvest, when the masters of the duck boats row up and down according to the opportunity of procuring food, which is found in plenty at the tide of ebb, as the rice plantations are overflowed at high water. It is curious to observe how these birds obey their masters; for some thousands belonging to different boats will feed at large on the same spot, and on a signal given will follow their leader to their respective boats without a single stranger being found among them. No fewer than 40,000 such boats are supposed to ply on the Tigris. When confined to dry situations, ducks degenerate in strength, beauty, and flavour. They feed on various animal and vegetable substances, for which they uneasily search with their curiously constructed bills, fitting and separating every alimentary particle from the mud. When older, they also devour worms, spawn, water-insects, and sometimes frogs and small fishes, together with the various seeds of bog and water plants.\n\nBlack-billed whistling duck.—Brown; head somewhat Arborescent; belly spotted with white and black. Smaller than the preceding. Inhabits Guiana and Jamaica; winters in Carolina, and builds and sits on trees.\n\nRed-crested duck.—Black; head and upper part of Rufina; neck tectaceous; crown reddish, that of the male crested; wings beneath, and at the edges white; tail brown. Female brown, and wants the crest. Inhabits the Caspian sea, and the lakes of the Tartarian deserts; is sometimes also found in Italy and Barbary.\n\nTufted duck.—Crest pendent; body black; belly and Fuligula-wing-float white; bill broad, livid, tipped with black; irides golden; head greenish; shoulders blackish-brown, with pale straw-coloured dots; legs dusky-blue. Female brownish, wants the crest. Sixteen inches long. Inhabits Europe and Northern Asia. There are several varieties. It is not uncommon with us in winter, and is frequently seen in our fresh waters as late as near the end of March. It is often brought to market, and sold for wigeon. It lives not only in fresh water, but in the sea; dives well, and feeds on small fishes, crabs and shellfish, and likewise on the seeds of aquatic plants, particularly those of the common ruff.\n\nGen. 33. Mergus.\n\nBill toothed, slender, cylindrical, hooked at the point; nostrils small, oval in the middle of the bill; feet four-toed, outer toe longest.\n\nThe birds of this genus live on fish, and are very destructive in ponds.\n\nCrested merganser.—Crest globular, white on each side; body brown above, white beneath; bill and legs black; irides golden; crest larger than the head, edged with black. Female brown; crest less and ferruginous. Length seventeen inches and a half; weight nearly 23 ounces. An elegant species, which inhabits North America, appearing at Hudson's bay about the end of May, and building, close to the lakes, a nest composed of grass, lined with feathers from its own breast.\n\nGoosander.—A longitudinal crest, somewhat erect; the breast white, without spots; the tail feathers ash-coloured; shaft black; bill, legs, and irides red; greater quill-feathers black; lesser white. Weight about four pounds; length two feet four inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Sometimes visits our rivers and lakes in severe winters, but retires to the more northern latitudes to breed. It has been known to build on trees, but more frequently among rocks or stones, and lays 14 eggs, which, with the bird itself, are eagerly devoured by the weasel. It swims with only the head above the surface of the water; dives deep; remains a long time below, and rises at a considerable distance. Its flesh is rancid and scarcely eatable. In quest of fish, it dives with great celerity, and holds its slippery prey with great security by means of its toothed bill, so admirably adapted to the purpose.\n\nDun diver, or sparkling fowl.—Crested; cinereous; Caftor-head and upper parts of the neck bay; chin, middle quill feathers, and belly white; bill and irides red; belly sometimes flesh-colour. Weighs about 38 ounces; measures\nmeasures 2½ inches in length. Inhabits the same countries with the preceding, and by some naturalists is reckoned the female; but the labyrinth, or enlargement at the bottom of the windpipe, seems to prove it to be a male, and consequently a distinct species.\n\nRed-breasted merganser.—Crest pendent; breast reddish and variegated; collar white; tail-feathers brown, varied with cinereous; under part of the bill and legs red; feathers of the sides of the breast large, white, edged with black, covering the fore part of the folded wings. Female with scarcely any crest; head and beginning of the neck rufous. Twenty-one inches long. Inhabits the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and America. Breeds in Greenland, Hudson's bay, Newfoundland, Siberia, the north of Scotland, &c. Makes its nest of withered grass, and down torn from its own breast, on dry land, and lays from eight to 13 white eggs, equal in size to those of a duck.\n\nSneew, or white nere.—Crest pendent; hind head black; body white; back and temples black; wings variegated; bill and legs black; wing-spot white; nape; oval spot from the bill surrounding the eyes, back, and two arched lines on each side, near the beginning of the wings, black. Female has the head smooth and gray; band across the eyes black, and under the eyes a white spot; body blackish-brown above; white beneath; upper part of the head bay; chin white. From 15 to 17 inches long. Inhabits Europe and America. Breeds in the Arctic regions, and is driven to the south only by severe weather.\n\nMinute sneew, or long diver.—Brown-ash; under parts of the body and chin white; head and upper part of the neck ferruginous; wing-spot white before and behind. Very much resembles the female of the preceding, but wants the black oval eye-spot. About 14 inches and a half long. Is rarely met with in the south of England, and only in winter when the weather is severe. It dives with great ease in pursuit of fish, and remains long under water.\n\nGen. 34. Alca, Auk.\n\nCharacters. Bill toothless, short, compressed, convex, often transversely furrowed; lower mandible gibbous near the base; nostrils linear; legs (in most cases) three-toed.\n\nThe birds of this genus are mostly inhabitants of the Arctic seas; are accounted stupid, breed in holes, which they themselves often dig, and in the caverns and fissures of rock, where they rest during the night. In respect of colour, they are generally uniform, being black above, and white beneath. They are shaped like a duck, with their feet placed behind the centre of gravity; their bills are large, having the surfaces crossed with furrows, and ending in an acute point. They lay but one egg, which is very large, considering the size of the bird.\n\nPuffin.—Bill compressed, two-edged with two grooves; orbits and temples white; upper eye lid daggered or furnished with a pointed callus; body black; cheeks, breast, and belly white; bill red, with a black base; legs red. Weighs between 12 and 13 ounces; length upwards of 12 inches. Inhabits the northern seas of Europe, Asia, and America, in vast flocks. Appears on many parts of our rocky coast about the middle of April, and begins to breed about the middle of May.\n\nOn the Dover cliffs, and other such places, they deposit their single egg in the holes and crevices; in other places they burrow like rabbits, if the soil is light, but more frequently take possession of rabbit burrows, and lay their egg some feet underground. On St Margaret's island, off St David's, the fishermen put their hands into the holes, and the puffins seize them so obstinately, that they allow themselves to be drawn out. In other places they are caught with ferrets, and the young are taken and pickled. About the latter end of August they retire from our coasts, and have all migrated by the beginning of September. Their principal food is small fish, particularly sprats, with which they feed their young.\n\nGreat ank or penguin.—Bill compressed, edged; an Impennir, oval spot on each side before the eyes. Bill black, with eight or ten grooves; wings short and imperfect; secondary quill feathers tipped with white; legs black. Three feet long. Inhabits Europe and America; occurs in the most northern parts of Britain, and breeds in the Isle of St Kilda, appearing about the beginning of May, and retiring about the middle of June. The shortness of its wings renders them useless for flight, but of singular service in diving under water, where they act as fins, and thus enable it to pursue its prey with great velocity. It lays an egg six inches long, white and marked with purple spots, close to the sea mark, being incapable of flying, and almost of walking.\n\nRazorbill.—Bill with four grooves, and a white line on each side as far as the eyes. Bill black; the largest groove white; body black above, the under parts, from the middle of the throat white; secondary quill feathers tipped with white; legs black. In the young bird the bill has but one groove, and, in the still younger, there is no line from the bill to the eyes. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits Europe and North America. The birds of this species associate with the guillemots, and also breed in the same places. About the beginning of May they take possession of the highest impending rocks, for the purpose of incubation, and on the ledges of these rocks they assemble in great numbers, fitting closely together, and often in a series of ones above another. There they deposit their single large egg on the bare rock, and notwithstanding the multitudes of them which are thus mixed together, yet no confusion takes place; for each bird knows her own egg, and hatches it in that situation. The razorbill is principally called auk, murre, falke, marrot, and scot.\n\nDufty auk.—Size of the miffel thrush; the length 11 inches. Upper mandible of the bill bent at the point; colour yellow brown; the ridge white; irides white and surrounded with a black circle; forehead covered with downy feathers, which are reflexed, half one way, and half the other; behind the eyes a stripe of white; head and neck black; upper parts of the body black; legs livid; webs black. Inhabits Japan and Kamtschatka. Is sometimes seen at a great distance from land, when it is solitary, but on land is gregarious.\n\nPerroquet auk.—Bill compressed, with a single groove in each mandible; a white spot on the upper eyelid, between and under the eyes. Inhabits the sea between Japan and Kamtschatka, and often intimates approaching land to mariners.\n\nTufted auk.—Entirely black; bill with three transverse grooves, 1½-inch in length, scarlet; sides of the head, Fig. 1.\nhead, space round the eyes, and the angle of the throat white; a yellow tuft of feathers rises from the upper eyebrow and stretches to the neck; legs brownish orange; claws black; length 19 inches; female less; the tufts smaller, and the bill crooked only with two grooves. Inhabits Kamtschatka and the neighbouring islands.\n\nLittle auk, little black and white diver, Greenland dove, sea turtle, &c.—Bill without furrows and conical; the whole abdomen and tips of the flag feathers white; feet black. There is a variety that is totally white, and another with a rufous breast. Nine inches long. Inhabits Europe and America, particularly Spitzbergen, Greenland, and Newfoundland, where they are called ice birds; but they are rare visitants of the British isles.\n\nPigmy auk.—Bill carinated, depressed at the base; body black above, cinereous beneath. Seven inches long. Inhabits the islands between Asia and America.\n\nGen. 35. Aptenodytes, Penguin.\n\nBill straight, a little compressed and sharp-edged; upper mandible longitudinally and obliquely grooved, the lower truncated at the tip; tongue with reflected prickers; wings fin-shaped, without quill feathers; feet placed behind, four-toed, and palmated.\n\nThe birds of this genus resemble those of the preceding in colour, food, habit, and apparent stupidity, as also in the situation of their feet, in their erect walk, in their nests, and in their eggs. They differ from them, however, in this, that they are all inhabitants of the South seas, from the equator to the Antarctic circle. They are quite incapable of flying, the feathers on their wings being too short as to resemble scales. They are fortified against cold by an abundance of fat; they swim very swiftly; on land they sit erect, in a singular manner, and in vast multitudes, and they cackle like geese, only in a hoarser tone. Their nostrils are linear, and hidden in a furrow of the bill; their wings covered with a strong dilated membrane, and their tail feathers very rigid.\n\nCrested penguin.—Bill reddish brown; legs reddish; frontal crest black, erect, auricular, sulphur colour, and shed on each side; body blueish black, white beneath; wings white beneath. Female with a yellowish stripe on the eyebrow. Twenty-three inches long. Inhabits the Falkland islands, and the southern parts of New Holland. Called hopping penguin and jumping jack, from its action of leaping quite out of the water, for three or four feet, at least, on meeting with the least obstacle. Though more lively than its congeners, it is so foolish as to allow itself to be knocked on the head with a flick, or even to be taken by the hand. When irritated, it erects its crest in a beautiful manner. These birds make their nests among those of the pelican tribe, with which they live in tolerable harmony, and seldom lay more than one egg, which is white, and larger than that of a duck.\n\nPatagonian penguin.—Bill and legs black; ears with a golden spot; lower mandible tawny at the base; irides hazel; head and hind part of the neck brown; back dark blue; breast, belly, and vent white. Four feet three inches long. Inhabits Falkland islands and New Guinea. M. Bougainville caught one, which soon became so tame as to follow and know the person who had the care of it; at first it fed on flesh, fish, and bread, but after some time, grew lean, pined and died. This species is not only the largest, but the fattest of its genus; and its flesh, though not very unpalatable, is black.\n\nCape penguin.—Bill and legs black; eyebrows and Demerfa-pectoral band white. Size of a large duck; length 21 inches. Inhabits the Atlantic and Antarctic seas, chiefly round the Cape of Good Hope. Lays two white eggs, which are reckoned delicious eating. Like all of the genus, swims and dives well, but hops and flutters in a strange awkward manner on land, and if hurried stumbles perpetually, or makes use of its wings instead of legs, till it can recover its upright posture, crying at the same time like a goose, but with a hoarser voice. There are two or three varieties.\n\nLittle penguin.—Bill black; legs white. Fifteen inches long. Inhabits New Zealand. Digs deep holes in the earth, in which it lays its eggs.\n\nGen. 36. Procellaria, Petrel.\n\nBill toothless, a little compressed, hooked at the point; mandibles equal; nostrils cylindrical, tubular, trun- cated, lying on the base of the bill; feet palmated, hind claw feebly, and without a toe.\n\nThe birds of this genus all frequent the deep, where they endure the greatest storms, being hardly ever seen on shore, except at breeding time. They are, however, capable of walking, and their legs are bare of feathers a little above the knee. They feed on the fat of dead whales and fish, and have the faculty of spouting oil from their nostrils.\n\nPacific petrel.—Black; dusky beneath; legs spotted with black; bill plumbeous and much hooked; nostrils elevated, oval, distinct, obliquely placed; legs pale. Twenty-two inches long. Inhabits, in vast flocks, the islands of the Pacific ocean. These flocks disappear at once, dipping under water altogether, and then rise as suddenly.\n\nDriving petrel.—Blackish brown; white beneath; bill Urinatoria; and chin black; legs blue green, without the spur behind. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits New Zealand in numerous flocks, and dives remarkably well, often rising at considerable distances, with surprising agility. They croak like frogs, and sometimes make a noise like the cackling of a hen.\n\nStormy petrel, stormfinch, Mother Carey's chicken, &c. Pelagica.\n\n—Black, with a white rump. This species is about the size of a swallow, and in its general appearance and flight, not unlike that bird. Length of about six inches. The stormy petrel is rarely seen on our shores, except in some of the northern islands, where it breeds in the holes of rocks, or under loose stones, in the months of June and July. At all other seasons it keeps far out at sea. Multitudes of them are seen all over the vast Atlantic ocean, especially before stormy weather. They often skim with incredible velocity along the hollows of the waves, and sometimes on the summits, braving the utmost fury of the tempest. As they appear to run on the surface of the sea, they have their name from an allusion to Peter's walking on the water. The inhabitants of the Faroe islands draw a wick through the body of this bird, which is so fat as to burn when lighted, and serve the purpose of a candle.—There is a variety with\nthe body black; head and sides bluish; breast green, and wing coverts and rump spotted with green. Both sorts are excellent divers, feed on small fishes, are mute during the day, and clamorous in the night.\n\n**Snowy petrel.**—Snow white; shafts of the feathers and bill black; legs dusky blue. One foot long. Inhabits the colder parts of the Southern sea, especially in the neighbourhood of ice, the masses of which they often haunt in considerable flocks.\n\n**Fulmar petrel or fulmar.**—Whitish; back hoary; bill and legs yellowish; nostrils composed of two tubes, lodged in one sheath. About the size of the common gull, and 17 inches long. Inhabits the Northern and Southern seas; breeds in Greenland, Spitzbergen, St Kilda, &c., laying one large white egg. It is a bold and stupid bird, and very fat, living on fish, dead whales, and other carcases and filth, in quest of which it often follows ships for a great way. Its flesh, though rancid, is eaten raw, dried or boiled by the Kurile islanders, the Greenlanders and St Kildians, and the oil when expressed is used both for food and lamps. The young are in feather about the beginning of August, when the inhabitants of St Kilda endeavour to surprise them in their nests, to prevent them from spouting out their oil, which they do by way of defence. This oil is there valued as a catholicon; and every young bird yields nearly an English pint of it, which is carefully preserved. When the thermometer is above 52 degrees, it is very pure, but at a lower temperature becomes turbid.\n\n**Giant petrel, or prey petrel, or break bones.**—Brownish, spotted with white; white beneath; shoulders, wings and tail brown; bill and legs yellow; naked, wrinkled, yellow membrane at the angles of the mouth. Bigger than a goose; length 40 inches; expansion of the wings seven feet. Common in the high southern latitudes, and sometimes found, though more rare, in the Northern seas. Is often seen sailing with the wings expanded, close to the surface of the water, but without appearing to move them. At Christmas harbour, Ker-guelen's land, &c., they were so tame, that they suffered themselves to be knocked on the head with a stick, by our sailors, on the beach. Though their chief food is fish, they also feed on the carcases of seals and birds. Many of the sailors confound them with the albatrosses, though such of them as are better informed, call them Mother Carey's geese. They are reckoned to be very good food. An individual of this species is figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\n**Glacial petrel.**—Bluish-ash; back blackish; chin, throat and breast white; bill yellow; legs blue. Nineteen inches long. Inhabits the icy seas.\n\n**Pintado, or pintado petrel.**—Variegated with white and brown, and sometimes with yellowish and brown; bill and legs black; temples white and black. Size of the kittiwake; length 14 inches. This is the pintado bird of Dampier, the white and black spotted petrel of Edwards, and the Cape pigeon of our sailors. It is seldom seen much to the north of 30 degrees, and is most frequent about the Cape of Good Hope, and the neighbouring regions. It flies in very numerous flocks, which almost sweep the surface of the water. Our voyagers have traced them to New Zealand, Falkland islands, and various regions of the southern hemisphere. The sailors often catch them with some tarred string, or a bit of lard on a fishing rod. Sometimes they appear in such immense numbers, that 700 have been taken in one night. They feed on fish, but more frequently on the carcases of whales, &c.\n\n**Shearwater petrel or shearwater.**—Black above; white beneath; legs rufous; bill yellow, tipped with black; hind head whitish-ash; spurious wings spotted with black; first quill and tail feathers brown without and white within. Weight 17 ounces; is 15 inches long, and nearly the size of a pigeon. Inhabits the Southern and Arctic seas. Breeds in the Isle of Man, and in the Orkneys, in the former of which it is called manks puffin, and in the latter lyre. It takes possession of a rabbit burrow or other hole, and lays one white egg; blunt at each end, which is hatched in August. Though the flesh is rank and fishy, it is much relished by some. Great numbers are killed and barrelled with salt. These the inhabitants boil, and eat with potatoes. There is a variety that is cinereous above; white beneath, and with a clear white tail.\n\n**Gen. 37. DIOMEDEA, Albatrosses.**\n\nBill straight, upper mandible hooked at the point, lower truncated; nostrils oval, wide, prominent, lateral; tongue very small; toes three, all placed forwards.\n\nOnly four species are known to belong to this genus.\n\n**Wandering albatross, or man of war bird.**—White; back and wings with white lines; bill pale yellow; legs flesh-colour; quill feathers black; tail rounded and lead coloured; bill grooved, dirty yellow; nostrils remote from the base, and rising out of the furrow; tail feathers fourteen; thighs naked. From three feet and a half to four feet, long; bigger than a swan; weighs from twelve to twenty-eight pounds; and extends its wings from ten to thirteen feet. Inhabits most seas, but chiefly occurs within the tropics. It is frequent about the Cape of Good Hope, and towards the end of July appears in great numbers in Kamtschatka, and the seas which separate that part of Asia from America. It is very voracious, feeding on the salmon, which are found in shoals, in the mouths of rivers, on the flying-fish, when forced out of the water by the coryphaena, and on other fishes, which it devours whole, and in such quantities, as to be prevented by their weight from rising, though in general it soars very high. It likewise preys on mollusca, and is itself attacked by the sea-eagle, and the larus catarractus. On the shores of South America, it builds about the end of September, a nest of earth on the ground, from one to three feet high, and lays a number of eggs, which are four inches and a half long, and eatable, though the white of them does not coagulate with heat. Its voice resembles the braying of an ass, and its flesh is dry and hard.\n\n**Chocolate albatross.**—Bill whitish; body deep chestnut-brown; belly pale; face and wings whitish beneath. Three feet long. Inhabits the Pacific ocean.\n\n**Yellow-nosed albatross.**—White; bill black; keel of the upper mandible and base of the lower yellow; body chestnut-blue, white beneath. Three feet long. Occurs in the Southern hemisphere, from 30° to 60° round the pole. Flies five or six feet above the water.\n\n**Sooty albatross.**—Brown; head, bill, tail, quill feathers and claws footy-brown; area of the eyes white. Three feet long. Inhabits the Southern ocean within the antarctic.\nGen. 38. Pelecanus, Pelican.\n\nBill straight, bent at the point, and furnished with a nail; the nostrils form an almost obliterated slit; face somewhat naked; legs balancing the body equally; the four toes connected by a membrane.\n\nThe pelicans are gregarious, fond of fish, and in general remarkable for their extreme voracity. For the most part they keep out at sea, but some of them are likewise found in the interior parts of continents. They have all a long bill, in a lateral furrow of which lie the nostrils. Several of the tribe are rendered useful to mankind by being taught to fish.\n\nA. Bill without teeth.\n\nWhite, or common pelican.—White; gullet pouched; bill from fifteen to sixteen inches long, red; upper mandible depressed and broad, the lower forked; bag at the throat flaccid, membranaceous, capable of great distention; irides hazel; gape of the mouth wide; head naked at the sides, covered with a flesh-coloured skin; hind-head somewhat crested; body faintly tinged with flesh colour; spurious wings and first quill feathers black; legs lead colour. Larger than a swan, and about five feet long. Inhabits Asia, Africa, and South America. In fishing, this bird does not immediately swallow its prey, but fills its bag, and returns to the shore to devour at leisure the fruits of its industry. As it quickly digests its food, it has generally to fish more than once in the course of the day. At night it retires a little way on the shore to rest, with its head resting against its breast. In this attitude it remains almost motionless, till hunger calls it to break off its repose. It then flies from its resting place, and raising itself thirty or forty feet above the surface of the sea, turns its head, with one eye downwards, and continues to fly in that posture till it sees a fish sufficiently near the surface, when it darts down with astonishing swiftness, seizes it with unerring certainty, and stores it up in its pouch. It then rises again, and continues the same manoeuvres, till it has procured a competent flock. Clavigero informs us, that some of the Americans, to procure a supply of fish without any trouble, cruelly break the wing of a live pelican, and after tying the bird to a tree, conceal themselves near the place. The screams of the wounded and confined bird attract others of its kind, which eject for it a portion of provisions from their pouches. As soon as the men observe this, they rush to the spot, and after leaving a small quantity for the bird, carry off the remainder. The female feeds her young with fish macerated for some time in her bag. The pelican is susceptible of domestication, and may even be trained to fish for its master. Faber mentions an individual of this species which was kept in the court of the duke of Bavaria above forty years, and which seemed to be fond of the company of mankind, and of vocal and instrumental music. When a number of pelicans and corvoraunts are together, they are said to practice a singular method of taking fish. They spread into a large circle, at some distance from land; the pelicans flapping on the surface of the water with their extensive wings, and the corvoraunts diving beneath, till the fish contained within the circle, are driven before them towards the land; and as the circle contracts by the birds drawing closer together, the fish at last are brought into a small compass, when their pursuers find no difficulty in filling their bellies. In this exercise they are often attended by various species of gulls, which likewise obtain a share of the spoil. The pelican generally builds in marshy and uncultivated places, particularly in islands and lakes, making its nest, which is deep, and a foot and a half in diameter, of carices, and lining it with grass of a softer texture. It lays two or more white eggs, which, when persecuted, it sometimes hides in the water. When it builds in dry and desert places, it brings water to its young in its bag. It walks slowly, flies in flocks, and lives in society with other birds.\n\nRose-coloured pelican.—Rufy; gullet pouched; bill Rostrum and legs black; area of the eyes naked; pouch yellow. Size of a goose. Inhabits Manilla.\n\nFrigate pelican, or frigate bird.—Tail forked; body Aquilus; and orbits black; bill red; belly of the female white. Three feet long; extent of the wings fourteen feet. Inhabits within the tropics. This is the frigate bird of Dampier and other navigators. From its great expanse of wing, it is capable of flying very smoothly, and so high as to be scarcely visible, remaining much in the air, and remote from land. It feeds on fishes, particularly flying fish, on which it darts with the greatest velocity. It not unfrequently likewise preys on other piscivorous animals. It builds in trees or on rocks, and lays one or two eggs of a flesh colour, and spotted with red.\n\nLesser frigate pelican.—Tail forked; body ferrugineous; bill and orbits red. Resembles the last, but less.\n\nCorvoraunt.—Tail rounded; body black; head fome-Carbonate crested; bill blackish; the base of the lower mandible covered with a yellowish skin, extending under the chin, and forming a pouch; irides green; chin white, surrounded with a yellowish arch; tail long and lax, consisting of fourteen feathers; thighs with a white spot, dotted with black; legs black. Three feet long; size of a goose, but more slender, and weighs about seven pounds. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Common on many of our sea-coasts, building its nest on the highest parts of cliffs that hang over the sea, and laying three or more pale green eggs, about the size of those of a goose. In winter these birds disperse along the shores, and visit the fresh waters, where they commit great depredations among the fish. They are remarkably voracious, and have a very quick digestion. Though naturally extremely shy and wary, they are stupid and easily taken when glutted with food. Their smell, when alive, is more rank and offensive than that of any other bird, and their flesh is so disgusting, that even the Greenlanders will hardly taste it. It is not uncommon to see twenty of these birds together, on the rocks of the sea coast, with extended wings, drying themselves in the wind. In this attitude they sometimes remain for nearly an hour, without once closing their wings; and as soon as the latter are sufficiently dry to enable the feathers to imbibe the oil, they press this liquor from the receptacle on their rumps, and dress the feathers with it. It is only in one particular state that the oily matter can be spread on them, namely, when they are somewhat damp; and the instinct of the birds teaches them the proper moment. Corvoraunts were formerly sometimes\nsometimes trained in this country, as they still are in China, for the purpose of catching fish for the table. With this view they were kept with great care in the house, and when taken out for fishing, they had a leathern thong tied round their neck, to prevent them from swallowing their prey.\n\n**Graculus.**\n\n*Shag.*—Tail rounded; body black, brown beneath; tail feathers twelve; head and neck black, with a green gloss; back and wing-coverts purple black, glossy at the edges; middle of the belly dusky; legs black. Weighs about four pounds. Length twenty-nine inches. The female weighs about three pounds and a quarter; and is only twenty-seven inches long. Inhabits the northern seas of Europe. Swims with its head erect, and the body under water. On perceiving the flash of a gun, dives instantaneously, and rises at a considerable distance. Has the manners and habit of the preceding, and devours a prodigious quantity of fish. Near the Cape of Good Hope, a variety occurs with a yellow chin, and wedged tail. Another, which frequents the coasts of Cayenne and the Carribbee islands, is blackish above, brown beneath; and has the feathers above edged with black.\n\n**Pygmelus.**\n\n*Dwarf shag.*—Tail wedged; feathers twelve; body black, with a few scattered white spots. Female brown, without spots. Size of the garganey. Inhabits the Caspian sea.\n\n**Cristatus.**\n\n*Crested shag.*—Shining green, dusky beneath; bill and legs dusky; head crested. From two to three feet long. Inhabits the northern seas of Europe, occurs on our own coasts, and both in appearance and manners, resembles the graculus.\n\n**B. Bill serrated.**\n\n**Thagus.**\n\n*Saw-billed pelican.*—Brown; tail rounded; gullet pouched, and covered with short cinereous feathers; bill one foot long; each mandible hooked; pouch very large; legs black. Size of a turkey; extent of wings nine feet. Inhabits Chili.\n\n**Balsanus.**\n\n*Gannet, or soland goose.*—Tail wedged; body white; bill and quill feathers black; face blue; irides yellowish; tail feathers twelve; eyes surrounded with a naked skin of fine blue; legs black, and greenish on the fore part. Three feet long. Weighs seven pounds; and inhabits Europe and America. This species of pelican haunts the Bals island in the frith of Edinburgh, Ailfa, on the coast of Ayrshire, the island of St. Kilda, and hardly anywhere else in Europe. It arrives at these spots in March, and continues till September. As it must let itself fall before it takes wing, it requires a steep and precipitous breeding station. It makes a rude nest of sticks, grass, sea-plants, &c., and lays one egg. While the female is occupied with incubation, the male brings her food, which consists almost entirely of herrings and sprats. In the bag under their bill they are able to fetch four or five herrings at a time, and a great number of sprats, which the young bird extracts from the mouth of the old one, with its bill, as with pincers. The young begin to be taken in August, and by some are reared as an exquisite morsel; but the old ones are tough and rancid. The fowler who seizes the young, is let down by a rope from the top of a cliff, and is sometimes stationed on the slippery projection of a rock, with the perpendicular precipice of four hundred feet or more beneath him. The young are of a dark-gray colour, and continue so for a year or more, when they gradually become white, except the tips of their wings, which are always black. In September and October the old birds leave their breeding places, and migrate southward, following, as is alleged, the shoals of herrings. In December they are often seen off Lisbon plunging for sardines; but after that period, it is not well known what becomes of them till March. They are common on the coasts of Norway and Iceland, and are said to be met with in great numbers about New Holland and New Zealand. They also breed on the coast of Newfoundland, and migrate southward along the American shores as far as South Carolina. Of this species there are two varieties. The first is brown, spotted with white, and white beneath, with naked and blackish. The second is brown, with triangular white spots, whitish, and spotted with brown beneath; the bill, wings, tail, and legs brown.\n\n**Leffler gannet.**—Tail wedged; body whitish; all the Pifcater quill feathers black; face red. Two feet and a half long. Inhabits the Chinese, Indian, and American seas.\n\n**Booby.**—Tail wedged; body whitish; primary quill Suia feathers tipped with blackish; face red; bill gray, brownish at the base; irides pale ash; chin bald, yellowish; body white beneath; tail brownish at the tip; legs yellowish. Has its name from being so foolish as to alight on one's hand, if held out to it, when tired. Builds in places bare of trees, making its nest on the ground. Its flesh is black and rancid.\n\n**Fishing corvoraunt.**—Tail rounded; body brown, Sinenis. whitish, and spotted with brown beneath; throat white; bill yellow; irides blue. Inhabits China, where it is tamed for the purpose of catching fish.\n\n**Leffler booby.**—Black, white beneath; face downy, Parvus. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\n**Gen. 39. Plotus, Darier.**\n\n**Plotus.**\n\nBill straight, pointed, toothed; nostrils an oblong slit Characters near the base; face and chin naked; legs short; all the toes connected.\n\nThe birds of this genus have a small head, and long slender neck. They inhabit the southern and warmer latitudes, and live chiefly on fish, which they take by darting the head forwards, while the neck is contracted like the body of a serpent.\n\n**White-bellied darter.**—Head smooth; belly white, Anbinga. Inhabits Brazil. Two feet ten inches long. Builds on trees, and is scarcely ever seen on the ground. When at rest, it sits with the neck drawn in between the shoulders. The flesh is oily and rancid.\n\n**Black-bellied darter.**—Head smooth; belly black, Melanogaster. About three feet long. Inhabits Ceylon, Java, &c. Plate ccxcvi. There are several varieties.\n\n**Surinam darter.**—Head crested; belly white. Thirteen inches long. Inhabits Surinam. Is domesticated, and feeds on fish and insects, especially flies, which it catches with great dexterity.\n\n**Gen. 40. Phaeton, Tropic Bird.**\n\n**Phaeton.**\n\nBill sharp-edged, straight, pointed, the gape extending bey'nd the bill; nostrils oblong; hind-toe turned forwards.\nThe species of this genus inhabit the South sea, especially between the tropics. Their bill is compressed, and bent a little downwards; the lower mandible angulated. The feet have four toes, which are palmated. The tail is cuneiform, and distinguished by the great length of the two intermediate feathers.\n\nCommon tropic bird.—White; back, rump, and lesser wing-coverts streaked with white; two middle tail feathers black at the base; bill red. Two feet ten inches long; size of a wigeon. Flies very high, and at a great distance from land; feeds on young hawks, dolphins, and albatrosses. On land, where it is rarely seen except in the breeding season, it sits on trees, and builds on the ground, in woods. It is well known to navigators, to whom it generally announces their approach to the tropic, though this indication is by no means infallible, as the bird sometimes wanders to the latitude of 47°. It is subject to varieties. Its flesh is indifferent.\n\nBlack-billed tropic bird.—Streaked black and white, white beneath; bill black; quill feathers tipped with white; tail feathers with black. Nineteen inches and a half long. Inhabits Palmetto and Turtle islands.\n\nRed-tailed tropic bird.—Rufous flesh colour; bill and two middle tail feathers red. Two feet ten inches long, of which the two middle tail feathers measure one foot nine inches. Builds in hollows in the ground, under trees, and lays two yellowish-white eggs, with rufous spots. Inhabits the Mauritius.\n\nGen. 41. Colymbus.\n\nBill toothless, subulate, straight, and pointed; throat toothed; nostrils linear, at the base of the bill; feet placed far behind.\n\nThe birds of this family walk on land with awkwardness and difficulty, but swim and dive with great dexterity. The guillemots chiefly inhabit the seas; have a slender tongue, of the size of the bill. The latter is compressed, and covered with short feathers at the base; the upper mandible a little bent; flesh tough, and like the eggs, nauseous. The divers frequent also the northern lakes, have a strong bill, legs pointed, cylindrical, the edge of the mandible turned in, and the upper longer than the under; the nostrils divided in the middle by a membrane; the tongue long, sharp, serrated at the base on each side; legs slender, a black band between the thighs; tail feathers twenty. These birds are monogamous, fly with difficulty, and frequent fresh water in the breeding season. The grebes have no tail, a strong bill, lores naked, tongue a little cleft at the tip, body depressed, thickly covered with short shining plumages, wings short, and legs compressed. They are frequently found about the fresh waters of southern Europe.\n\nA. Feet three-toed. Guillemot.\n\nWhite guillemot.—Snowy; bill and legs brownish and flesh-coloured. Size of the garganey. Inhabits the Netherlands.\n\nBlack guillemot, spotted guillemot, Greenland dove, sea turtle, &c.—Body black; wing-coverts white. But these general markings are incident to great variety. The more special characteristics are; bill black, inside of the mouth and legs red; upper wing-coverts in the middle, and lower part of the belly white. Weighs fourteen ounces, and measures nearly the same number of inches in length. Inhabits Europe and America. Frequent the Faroe islands, the Balearic, St Kilda, &c., visiting these places in March, making its nest far under ground, and laying one egg of a dirty white, blotched with pale rust-colour. Except at breeding time, it keeps always at sea, lives on fish, flies low, and generally, in pairs. It cannot without much difficulty, rise from the ground. In the Orkney islands, it is called tytle. The Greenlanders eat its flesh, and use its skin for clothing, and its legs as a bait to their fishing lines.\n\nLeather guillemot.—Black, with a narrow stripe across Minor. the wings, cheeks and under parts white. Weight eighteen or nineteen ounces; length about fifteen inches. Inhabits the northern seas of Europe, and in winter frequents the frith of Forth in vast flocks; where it feeds on sprats, and is called marrot, or morrot. Many doubts have been entertained with regard to this bird, Dr Latham and other ornithologists having considered it as the young of the succeeding species. It is to be observed, however, that besides the difference in size and plumage, this bird is rarely met with in the fourth till the month of November, whence it has been called the winter guillemot, whereas the other species always leaves us before September, and does not again appear till the ensuing spring; and that its young, when they depart, are exactly like the old ones.\n\nFoolish guillemot or scout.—Body black; breast and belly snowy; secondary quill feathers tipped with white; bill black; inside of the mouth yellow; legs and tail blackish. Seventeen inches long. Inhabits the northern seas of Europe, Asia, and America. This species is likewise called marrot in Scotland, and lavie in St Kilda. In that island it appears about the beginning of February, and is hailed by the inhabitants as the harbinger of plenty. A St Kilda man descends in the night, by the help of a rope, to the ledge of a precipice, where he fixes himself, and tying round him a piece of white linen, awaits the arrival of the bird, which, mistaking the cloth for a piece of the rock, alights on it, and is immediately dispatched. In this way 400 are sometimes taken in one night, and at dawn the fowler is drawn up. The foolish guillemot lays but one egg, which is very large, unprotected by any nest, and has such a slender hold of the rock, that when the birds are surprised, and fly off suddenly, many of them tumble down into the sea. These birds seldom quit their eggs unless disturbed, but are fed with sprats and other small fish by the male. In places where they are seldom molested, it is with difficulty they are put to flight, and may sometimes be taken with the hand; others flutter into the water, appearing not to have much use of their wings.\n\nB. Four-toed, and palmated. Diver.\n\nRed-throated diver or loon.—A ferruginous shield-like Septentrion spot beneath the neck; body brown, with minute white spots above, white beneath; bill black; head and chin cinereous, spotted with brown; neck with small white and brown lines above; legs dark. Weighs about three pounds. Length near two feet and a half. Inhabits the north of Europe, Asia, and America, and is seldom seen far southward, except in very severe winters. In the breeding season it frequents the lakes, making a nest among the reeds and flags, and lays two eggs of an ash colour, marked with a few black spots. In Iceland\nit is said to make its nest of moss and grass, lined with down, among the grass of the shores contiguous to the waters. It breeds in the north of Scotland, but is seldom observed in the south of England. It lives on marine vermes, crabs, and the smaller fishes, with which it is sometimes taken in nets. It swims and flies swiftly; and when it screams in its flight is said to prefigure a storm.\n\n**Black-throated diver.**—Head hoary; neck violet black beneath, with an interrupted white band; bill black; body black above, white beneath; sides of the neck white, spotted with black; shoulders and wing-coverts with white spots, the former square, the latter round; quill feathers dusky. Two feet long. Inhabits the northern parts of Europe, Asia, and America, frequenting both the sea and lakes. Before rain, it is restless and clamorous; occurs in Scotland, but is not common in England.\n\n**Speckled diver or loon.**—White beneath; hind-head and quill feathers dusky; throat pale-ash; back, flanks, rump, and tail spotted with white; bill horn colour; legs brown. The weight of this species is about four pounds, and the length 27 inches. It inhabits the north of Europe and America, and is among the most common of the diver tribe found in this country, being frequently seen in winter, in our bays and inlets, and sometimes in fresh water rivers and lakes. From its attending the sprats in the Thames, it is called *sprat-loon* by the fishermen. In the northern regions it lays two eggs, the size of those of a goose, dusky, and with a few black spots, in the grass, on the borders of lakes.\n\n**Northern diver or greatest speckled diver.**—Head and neck purplish-black; chin and upper part of the neck with a white interrupted band; upper part of the body, bill, legs, and tail black; back with square white spots disposed in rows; wing-coverts with white dots. The largest of the genus sometimes weighing fifteen or sixteen pounds; and measuring nearly three feet and a half in length. Inhabits the north seas, and breeds in the fresh waters, in Iceland, Greenland, &c. Frequent the seas about the Orkneys, all the year round, without breeding there. The skin, which is tough, and well covered with soft down, is dressed in some parts of Russia, &c., and used as clothing.\n\n**Immer, imber, or ember goose, or diver.**—Body blackish and waved with white above, white beneath; feathers of the back, wings, and tail edged with white. Two feet long. Inhabits the Arctic ocean, and also, it is said, the lake of Constance, where it is called *fluder*. Unless in severe winters, it is rare in England, but is more common on the Scottish and Orkney coasts. It makes its nest on the water, among reeds and flags. It feeds on fish, after which it dives with great celerity, and is sometimes taken under water, by a baited hook.\n\n**C. Feet four-toed, lobed. Grebe.**\n\n**Crested grebe, gray, or ash-coloured loon, &c.**—Head rufous; collar black; secondary quill feathers white; bill flesh-coloured, brown at the tip; lores and irises red; body brown above, white beneath; head tumid, and varies in colour by age. During the first year, this bird has a smooth head, and a white spot on the wings; and during the second, a long downy tuft on each side of the throat. This is the largest of the grebes, weighing about two pounds and a half, and measuring twenty-one inches in length. It occurs in almost every lake in the northern parts of Europe, as far as Iceland, and southward to the Mediterranean, and is also found in various parts of America and Siberia. It is common in the fens and lakes in various parts of England, where it breeds. The female makes her nest of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, as of the nymphea, potamogoton, hottonia, &c., and the roots of menyanthes trifoliata, and conceals it among the flags and reeds which grow in the water, and where it erroneously said to float. The young are fed on small eels. In some countries, ladies' muffs and other ornamental articles of dress are made of the skin of the belly of this species, which has a fine down of a dazzling whiteness. It requires five skins to make a muff which sells at four or five guineas. The tippet grebe is the female or young of this species.\n\n**Eared grebe or dobchick.**—Blackish-brown above, white beneath; head black; ears crested, and ferruginous; bill and legs black; irides and lores red; primary quill feathers dusky, secondary white. There is a smaller variety, with a double crest, and the neck spotted with chestnut. This species is about twelve inches long, and inhabits the northern lakes of Europe and Siberia. It is also met with in southern climates, but is not numerous in England. According to Pennant, it breeds in the fens near Spalding in Lincolnshire, and the female makes a nest not unlike that of the preceding, laying four or five small white eggs.\n\n**Horned grebe.**—Head glossy-green; a yellow tufted coronet band through the eyes; neck and breast tawny. Size of the preceding. Inhabits North America.\n\n**Little grebe or small dipper.**—Of a reddish-brown above, white, with spots beneath; head smooth; feathers of the body edged with reddish; lower part of the belly grey; upper wing-coverts, and first and last quill feathers blackish, rest of the quill feathers white; bill blackish; base of the lower mandible reddish; legs blackish-green. Inhabits Europe, North America, the Philippine isles, and the Delta in Egypt. The least of the grebe tribe, weighing only between six and seven ounces, and measuring from the tip of the bill to the rump, ten inches. It seldom quits the water, and is a remarkable diver, feeding on fish, insects, and aquatic plants; constructing a large nest, a foot thick, of grass and the stalks of aquatic plants, in the midst of the waters which pervade it, and laying five or six whitish eggs, which it covers when it leaves the nest. In several parts of this country it is called *didapper*.\n\n**Red-necked grebe.**—Subcrested, brown; chin, cheeks, and region of the ears cinereous; under part of the bill, neck and breast rusty-red; belly, and secondary quill feathers white; bill black, the sides tawny at the base; irides tawny; legs dusky. Seventeen inches long; and weighs nearly nineteen ounces. Inhabits Europe, but is very rare in Britain.\n\n**Dusky grebe or black and white dobchick.**—Head smooth; body dark brown above; front, under parts of the body, and tips of the secondary quill feathers, white. Eleven inches long. Inhabits Europe and America. Breeds in the fens of Lincolnshire, and is found, in the winter, in our inlets on the coast, particularly in Devonshire, where it is by no means uncommon.\n\n**Black-chin grebe.**—Head smooth; body blackish; chin black; throat ferruginous; belly cinereous, mixed with\nAnseres. with silvery. Somewhat larger than the little grebe. Inhabits Tiree, one of the Hebrides.\n\nGen. 42. Larus, Gull.\n\nBill straight, sharp-edged, a little hooked at the tip, and without teeth; lower mandible gibbous below the point; nostrils linear, broadest on the fore part, and placed in the middle of the bill.\n\nThe birds of this genus have a light smooth body; long wings; a strong bill; the tongue somewhat cleft; the feet short; bare of feathers above the knee; with a small back toe. They inhabit the north; feed chiefly on fishes, and even on those that are dead. When harried, they throw up or discharge their food. As the young are sometimes spotted to their third year, the extrication of the species is attended with doubt and difficulty.\n\nA. Nostrils without a cere.\n\nTarrack or kittiwake.—Whitish; the back grayish; tips of the tail feathers, except the outermost, black; three toes. In mature age, the characters are; back whitish-hoary; quill feathers white; hind toe unarmed. Ornithologists, in fact, seem now to be agreed, that L. tridactylus and L. rissa, are only varieties of the same species. A third variety occurs, distinguished by an oblique black band on the wings, and white chin. About the size of a pigeon; about fourteen inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Breeds on the cliffs about Flamboroughhead, the Bays, Isle of May, the rocks near Slains Castle, &c.; lays two eggs; feeds on fishes, and seeks its food in company of seals and whales. It swims and flies rapidly, and is often clamorous. Its flesh is much relished by the Greenlanders, who also make clothing of its skin. One that was kept and tamed, knew its master's voice at a distance, and answered him with its hoarse piping note. It had a voracious appetite, and though plentifully fed on bread, would rob the poultry of their share.\n\nLittle gull.—Snowy; head and beginning of the neck black; back and wings russet; bill brown-red; legs scarlet. Size of a thrush. Inhabits Russia and Siberia.\n\nCommon gull.—White; back hoary; primary quill feathers black at the ends, the fourth and fifth with a black spot at the tip, the outer one black without; bill yellow; irides hazel; legs greenish white. A variety is met with that has the head spotted with brown; neck brown above, and tail feathers white, with a black band. This is generally supposed to be the younger bird. Inhabits Europe and America. Seventeen inches long; of the size of a pigeon; and is seen in numerous flocks, continually screaming. Lives on fishes, vermes, and the larvae of insects; builds among rocks and stones, and is a foolish bird. The most common and numerous of all the British gulls, breeding on rocky cliffs, and laying two eggs, nearly the size of those of a common hen, of an olive brown colour, marked with dark reddish blotches. At the mouths of the larger rivers they are seen in numbers, picking up the animal substances which are cast on shore, or come floating down with the ebbing tide. For this kind of food they watch with a quick eye, and it is curious to observe how such as are near the breakers will mount up the surface of the water, and run splashing towards the summit of the wave to catch the object of their pursuit. At particular seasons, this species also resorts to the inland parts of the country, to feed on worms, &c. Some persons who live near the sea, commonly eat this, as well as various other kinds of gulls, which they describe as being good food, when they have undergone a certain sweetening process before cooking; such as burying them in fresh mould for a day, or washing them in vinegar. This species breeds on the ledges of rocks, close to the sea-shore, sometimes not far above the water. This bird is frequently seen in winter, at a considerable distance from the coast. It flocks with rooks in severe weather, and will follow the plough for the sake of the larva of the chaffier.\n\nBlack-backed gull or great black and white gull.—Marinus. White; back black; bill yellow; lower mandible with a red spot near the tip and black in the middle; irides yellow; lower part of the back white; quill feathers black, tipped with white; legs flesh-coloured. The markings, however, vary considerably with the age of the bird. The weight of this species is four pounds and three quarters; and the length near thirty inches. It inhabits Europe and America. Though not very plentiful on our coasts, it is occasionally seen in small flocks of eight or ten, sometimes in pairs, but never associating with the other gulls. It cackles like a goose, lives chiefly on fish, but also infests the elder duck, and even lambs. It has been known to tear and devour the largest fish on the hooks, when left dry by the ebbing tide. It breeds on the steep holmes, and Lundy island, in the Bristol channel, makes a nest in the crevices of the highest rocks, and lays three eggs of a blackish-gray colour, with dark purple spots; and eatable. Its skin is used for clothing by the Esquimaux and Greenlanders; and the young not only affords a fine down, but an article of food.\n\nHerring gull.—White; back brown; legs yellow; Fuscus. Bill yellow; irides straw-coloured; five first quill feathers black above. Weight about thirty-three ounces; length twenty-three inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and North America, proceeding southward in winter as far as the Black and Caspian seas, Jamaica, and the islands on the shore of South Carolina. It lives on fish, especially herrings, which it seizes with great boldness, and the shoals of which it accompanies in flocks. It is sometimes observed to trample the soft land, by moving its feet alternately in the same place, for the purpose, it is supposed, of forcing up sand-eels, or some hidden prey. This species is very common on the British shores; makes its nest of dry grass on the projecting ledges of the rocks, and lays three eggs of a dull whitish colour, spotted with black. Fishermen describe it as the constant, bold, and intruding attendant on their nets, from which they find it difficult to drive it away.\n\nBlack-headed gull.—Whitish; head blackish; bill Atricilla. Red; legs black. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits Europe and America. Flies about the shores in flocks, with a continual clamour; and builds in pine-trees.\n\nLaughing or black-headed gull.—Whitish; head black-Ridibundus; bill and legs pale red. Eyelids red; irides hazel; dusky-brown; and in the full-grown bird, black; first ten quill feathers white-edged, and tipped with black, the rest cinereous, tipped with white; claws black. This species has its name from its singular cry, which resembles a hoarse laugh. It is fifteen inches long; inhabits Europe, America, and the Bahama islands; and breeds in the pools and fens of England, making its nest on the ground, with rushes, dried grass, &c., and laying three greenish-brown eggs, spotted with tawny.\nIn former times, (says Mr Bewick,) these birds were looked upon as valuable property by the owners of some of the fens and marshes in this kingdom, who every autumn caused the little ells or harts in those waters, to be cleared of the reeds and rushes, in order properly to prepare the spots for the reception of the old birds in the spring, to which places at that season they regularly returned in great flocks to breed. The young ones were then highly esteemed as excellent eating; and on that account were caught in great numbers before they were able to fly. Six or seven men, equipped for this purpose, waded through the pools, and with long poles drove them to the land, against nets placed upon the shores of the harts, where they were easily caught by the hand, and put into pens ready prepared for their reception. The gentry assembled from all parts to see the sport. \"There were the sea-gulls of which we read as being so plentifully provided at the great feasts of the ancient nobility and bishops of this realm. Although the flesh of these birds is not now esteemed a delicacy, and they are seldom sought after as an article of food, yet in the breeding season, where accommodation and protection are afforded them, they still regularly resort to the same old haunts, which have been occupied by their kind for a long time past.\"\n\nB. Nyctilis covered with a core.\n\nParusitius. Arctic gull.—Two middle-tail feathers very long; bill and legs dusky; body black above; temples, throat, and under parts of the body white; breast with a dusky band. Female brown beneath; twenty-one inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Breeds in the Hebrides and Orkneys, among the heath, making its nest of grass and moss, in some marshy place, and laying two eggs, the size of those of a hen, ash-colored and spotted with black. It is very rapacious, and pursues the lesser gulls, not for their dung, as some have asserted, but to make them disgorge what they have lately eaten, which it dexterously catches and devours before it reaches the water. It is to be remarked, that all this tribe are voracious, and if chased by a hawk, or other bird that creates alarm, readily disgorge, in order to lighten themselves, and thus escape by flight. It is no uncommon thing to see them bring up a large quantity of half digested food, when slightly wounded by shot; and tame gulls will do the same, if driven by a dog. It may also be observed, that gulls float highly on the surface of the water by reason of the quantity of feathers in proportion to their weight, and seem to be incapable of diving. If they should be wounded ever so slightly, and fall into the water, they never attempt to dive like other aquatic birds.\n\nCrepidatus. Black-toed gull.—Varied with dirty white and brown, paler beneath; two middle tail feathers a little longer; bill black; breast and belly white, with numerous dusky and yellowish lines; flanks and vent transversely black and white; wing-coverts and tail black edged with white or brownish; legs bluish; toes and connecting membrane black. Weight about eleven ounces; length fifteen or sixteen inches. Inhabits Europe and America, but is not common on the British shores. Its habits nearly coincide with those of the preceding species. Its excrement is said to be red, from the circumstance of its feeding on the helix fanthina.\n\nSkua quill.—Grayish; quill and tail feathers white at the base; tail nearly equal; bill dusky, much hooked, upper mandible covered half way with a black cere; body brown above, rusty-ash beneath; legs blackish, rough, warty; claws hooked, black; hind-toe short, with a sharp-hooked claw; two feet long. Inhabits Europe and America. These fierce birds are met with by navigators in the high latitudes of both hemispheres, where they are much more common than in the warm or temperate parts of the globe. They are often mentioned in Captain Cook's Voyages, and, from their being numerous about Falkland islands, the seamen call them Port Egmont hens. They are also common in Norway, Iceland, the Shetland and Faroe isles, &c. They prey not only on fish, but also on the lesser sorts of water fowl, and are so courageous in defence of their own young, that they attack either man or beast, that dares to disturb their nest. They make their nests among the dry grass, and, when the young are reared, they disperse themselves commonly in pairs over the ocean. In the island of Foula, in Shetland, the skua gull is called bonzie, and is a privileged bird, there being a fine of 10l. Scotch for destroying its eggs, because it keeps off the eagle during the whole breeding season.\n\nGen. 43. Sterna, Tern.\n\nBill subulate, somewhat straight, pointed, a little compressed, without teeth; nostrils linear; tongue pointed; wings very long; tail generally forked.\n\nThe birds of this genus are mostly inhabitants of the ocean, and feed on fishes. They are seldom afraid of man.\n\nSooty tern.—Black above; upper parts of the body, cheeks, and front shafts of the quill and tail feathers white; fifteen inches long. Inhabits the Atlantic and Antarctic seas.\n\nNoddy.—Body black; front whitish; eye-brows black; bill and legs black; hind-head cinereous; fifteen inches long; found chiefly within the tropics; is clamorous, seldom goes far from shore, and always rests there during the night. It builds on the rocks, and its eggs are reckoned excellent food.\n\nSandwich tern.—White; back and wings hoary; cap black; front with white spots; quill feathers black; iris, with a white shaft; bill black, yellowish at the tip; legs black; wings longer than the tail; egg olive-brown, with purplish and crowded spots; eighteen inches long. Inhabits the Kentish coast, generally appearing about Romney, in the middle of April, and departing in the beginning of September. It is not uncommon about Sandwich, where it was first particularly noticed by Mr Boys. The circumstance of its breeding in England has not been perfectly ascertained. The hævia of some authors, or the Kamtschatkan tern of Pennant, appears to be only a variety, which is black, with paler colours above; white beneath; and bill and legs black.\n\nCommon, or greater tern.—Two outer tail feathers black, and half white; bill and legs crimson; the former tipped with black; crown and area of the eyes black; rest of the head, neck, tail, and body, white beneath; back and wings cinereous; outer tail feathers black on the outer edge. There is a variety with black legs, and the outer tail feathers entirely white. The weight of this species is about four ounces and a quarter;\nand its length fourteen inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. It frequents our flat, sandy, or thinly shores, and lays three or four eggs, of the size of a pigeon's, of an olivaceous brown, and spotted and blotched with dusky; among stones, without making any nest. It is noisy and restless, constantly on wing, in search of insects and small fish; in pursuit of which it darts into the water with great force, seizes its prey, and instantly returns; for, though web-footed, it is not observed to swim or dive. It is commonly known by the name of the sea swallow, and, in some parts, by that of the gull rooster, from its persecuting the smaller gulls, and obliging them to disgorge. In New England it is called mackerel gull, and at Hudson's bay it is known by the name of black-head. The young birds are mottled with brown and white, and are, most probably, the brown tern described by Ray and other ornithologists.\n\nWhite tern.—White; bill and legs black; length between two and three inches. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nBlack-headed tern.—Body hoary; head and bill black; legs red; size of the preceding. Inhabits Europe.\n\nLeffler tern.—Body white; back hoary; front and eye-brows white; bill yellow, tipped with black; irises brown; cap black; a black band through the eyes; legs yellow; eight inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe and America. It has the habits of the common species, but is far less numerous. It lays two eggs, of a very pale brown, spotted all over with cinereous and dusky, and placed in a small depression among the flingle, without any nest.\n\nBlack tern.—Body black; back ash-coloured; belly white; feet red; bill black; male with a white spot on the chin; wings and tail cinereous; vent and lower tail coverts white; length ten inches. Inhabits Europe and America, and has all the actions and manners of the other species, but seems to prefer fresh-water insects and fish to marine. It feeds on the verge of pools, in swampy places, and often remote from the sea. In the fenny parts of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire it is called ear-swallow. Though very plentiful about the reedy pools of the Romney marshes, it keeps to the edges of the stagnant water, and is rarely seen on the adjoining sea shore, till after the breeding season, and even then not very commonly. It lays three or four eggs about the size of those of a magpie, of an olive brown colour, blotched and spotted with brown and black.\n\nGen. 44. Rynchos, Skimmer.\n\nBill straight; upper mandible shorter than the under, the latter truncated at the apex; tail forked and shorter than the wings; nostrils linear, and the back toe small.\n\nBlack skimmer, or cut-water.—Blackish; white beneath; bill red at the base; the lower mandible grooved; front and chin white; wings with a transverse white band; two middle tail feathers black, the next edged with white; legs red; twenty inches long. Inhabits Asia and America. This bird is ever on the wing, sweeping the surface of the water, dipping in its bill, or at least the under mandible, to scoop out the smaller fishes on which it feeds. In stormy weather it frequents the shores, and is contented with oysters and other shell-fish.\n\nORDER IV. GRALLÆ.\n\nBill subcylindrical, and somewhat obtuse; tongue entire and fleshy; legs naked above the knees; the characters feet are commonly furnished with four toes, of which three stand forwards, and one backwards, sometimes wholly unconnected, and at other times half connected by a web. Some species, too, have only three toes; their legs are long, that they may seek their food in marshy and swampy places, for which reason they have also a long neck, and, for the most part, a long bill. Their bodies are oval, and somewhat compressed, and their tail is generally short. They build chiefly on the ground and in marshy places, and feed principally on fishes and water insects. They are all more or less migratory, and such as inhabit the more northern countries of Europe, universally leave them at the approach of winter.\n\nGen. 45. Phænicopteros, Flamingo.\n\nBill bare; toothed and bent as if broken; nostrils linear; the feet four-toed and palmated, the membranes semicircular on the fore part; hind toe not connected.\n\nThe birds of this genus combine the anseres with the grallæ. They have the neck and legs long; the bill strong and thick, the upper mandible carinated above, and denticulated at the margin, the under one compressed and transversely fulcated; the nostrils above covered with a thin membrane, and communicating with each other; the back-toe very small, and the web which connects the fore-toes, reaching to the nails.\n\nRed flamingo.—Flag feather black. This singular Ruler bird is scarcely so big as a goose, but has the neck and legs in a greater disproportion to the body than any other bird; the length from the end of the bill to that of the tail being four feet, and two or three inches; but, to the end of the claws, sometimes more than six feet; the bill is four inches and a quarter long, and of a structure different from that of any other bird, the upper mandible being very thin and flat, and somewhat moveable, the under thick and both bending downwards from the middle; the end, as far as the curvature, is black, and the rest reddish-yellow; a flesh-coloured cere extends round the base of the bill to the eye; the neck is slender and of an immoderate length; the tongue, which is large and fleshy, fills the cavity of the bill, has a sharp cartilaginous tip, and is furnished with twelve or more hooked papillae on each side, which bend backwards. The bird, when in full plumage, which it does not acquire till the third year, is of a most beautiful deep scarlet, except the quills, which are black. The flamingo affects the warmer latitudes; and, in the old continent, is not often met with beyond the 45th degree north or south. It is met with everywhere on the African coast and adjacent islands to the Cape of Good Hope, and sometimes on the coasts of Spain and Italy, and even on those of France that lie on the Mediterranean, having been found at Marseille and for some way up the Rhone. It is seen also on the Persian side of the Caspian sea, and from thence along the western coast as far as the Wolga. They breed in the Cape de Verd islands, particularly in that of Sal, constructing a nest\nGrallae. of mud in the shape of a hillock, with a cavity at top, in which the female generally lays two white eggs, of the size of those of a goose, but more elongated. The hillock is of sufficient height to admit the bird's sitting on it conveniently, or rather standing, as the legs are placed one on each side at full length. Sometimes the female will deposit her eggs on the projecting part of a low rock, if otherwise adapted to the above-mentioned attitude. The young are not able to fly till they are grown, but they can previously run with amazing swiftness. In this immature state, they are sometimes caught and easily tamed. In five or six days, they become familiar, and even eat out of the hand, and drink a great quantity of sea water. It is, however, difficult to rear them, as they are very liable to pine from want of their natural subsistence, which chiefly consists of small fish and water insects. These they take by plunging the bill and part of the head into the water, and from time to time trampling the bottom with their feet, to disturb the mud, and raise up their prey. In feeding they are said to twist the neck in such a manner, that the upper part of their bill is applied to the ground. Except in the breeding season, flamingos are generally observed in great flocks, and at a distance appear like a regiment of soldiers, being often ranged alongside of one another on the borders of rivers. When the Europeans first visited America, they found these birds on the shores tame and gentle, and no way distrustful of mankind. We learn from Cateley, that when the fowler had killed one, the rest of the flock, instead of attempting to fly, only regarded the fall of their companion in a kind of fixed astonishment; so that the whole flock were sometimes killed in detail, without one of them attempting to make its escape. They are now, however, extremely shy, and one of their number acts as sentinel, while the rest are feeding. The moment that this guard perceives the least danger, he gives a loud scream, like the sound of a trumpet, and instantly all are on the wing, and fill the air with their screams. The flamingo, when at rest, stands on one leg, the other being drawn up to the body, with the head placed under the wing on that side of the body on which it stands. Its flesh is esteemed tolerable eating, and that of the young has been compared to partridge. Pliny, Martial, and other writers of antiquity, have celebrated the tongue as a morsel of exquisite relish.\n\nChili flamingo.—Quill feathers white; bill covered with a reddish skin; head subcerebrated; measures five feet from the bill to the claws. Inhabits Chili; frequents only fresh waters, and is extremely shy.\n\nGen. 46. PLATAEA, Spoonbill.\n\nBill long and thin, the tip dilated, orbicular and flat; nostrils small at the base of the bill; tongue short and pointed; feet four-toed and semipalmated.\n\nWhite spoonbill.—Body white; chin black; hind head somewhat crested. Bill black, brown or spotted; tongue heart-shaped; irides gray; lores, orbits, and naked dilatable chin black; quill feathers sometimes tipped with black; legs black. This species admits of two varieties, of which the first has the wings varied with black and white, and the legs yellowish, and the second has the body all white, and the legs flesh coloured. The white or common spoonbill weighs about three pounds and a half, and measures two feet eight inches in length. It inhabits from the Ferozilles to the Cape of Good Hope; but rarely occurs in England. It lives on grass, carices, the roots of reeds, serpents, frogs, mussels, and other shell-fish, but especially on fishes, which it often seizes from other birds. It makes its nest in high trees, near to the sea, and lays three or four white eggs, sprinkled with a few pale red spots. The flesh, especially of the young bird, tastes like that of a goose.\n\nRed-cate spoonbill.—Body rosy-coloured; tail coverts scarlet; bill cinereous white, with a furrow parallel with the edge; face and chin naked and whitish; legs gray. This species also frequently appears of a blood red hue; the neck white; collar black; and tail feathers flecked. Two feet three inches long. Inhabits South America and Jamaica. Figured in Latham's Synopsis.\n\nDwarf spoonbill.—Body brown above; white beneath. Size of a sparrow. Inhabits Guiana and Surinam.\n\nGen. 47. PALAMEDEA, Screamer.\n\nBill conical, the upper mandible hooked, nostrils oval; feet four-toed, cleft, a very small membrane connecting the toes at the root.\n\nHorned screamer.—Wings with two spines at the curvature, front horned; bill and legs black; irides golden; body blackish above, white beneath; wings reddish beneath; spines strong, sharp, horny, triangular, yellow; horn on the front recurved, round, whitish; three inches long; hind toe straight. Three feet four inches long. Inhabits the fenny parts of South America; making a large nest of reeds, in the shape of an oven, on the ground, and laying two eggs the size of those of a goose. It is remarked, that they are always met with in pairs, and if one dies, the other mourns to death for the loss. On hearing the least noise, or seeing any one, even at a distance, they rise from the ground and make a loud screaming noise. They feed principally on herbs, seeds, and reptiles. The flesh of the old bird is tough and ill tasted; but that of the young, though very dark, is frequently eaten by the natives.\n\nCrested screamer.—Wings unarmed; front crested. Size of a heron. Inhabits Brazil.\n\nGen. 48. MYCTERIA, Jabiru.\n\nBill a little bending upwards and sharp-pointed; upper mandible triangular; front bald; nostrils linear; tongue small or wanting; feet four-toed and cleft.\n\nAmerican jabiru.—White; quill and tail feathers purplish-black; bill long, stout and black; head and neck bald, two thirds of the neck blackish, the rest red; hind head cinereous; legs long, stout and blackish. Nearly six feet long. Inhabits the savannas of South America; is migratory and gregarious, makes its nest in large trees, lays two eggs, and tends the young till they can descend to the ground. The colour of the young birds is gray; the second year it changes to rose colour, and the third to pure white. They are very wild and voracious, and destroy great quantities of fish. The flesh of the young birds is said to be good eating, but that of the old is hard and oily.\n\nIndian jabiru.—White; band over the eyes, lower part of the back, quill and tail feathers black; bill blackish;\nGen. 49. CANCROMA, Boatbill.\n\nBill gibbous, and shaped like an inverted boat; nostrils small, and placed in a furrow; tongue small; toes divided.\n\nCrested boatbill.—Crested; cinereous; belly rufous; crown and lermule on the neck black; bill brown; lores naked and blackish; crest long, pendulous and pointed; legs yellowish-brown; toes connected at the base. The body is sometimes spotted with brown. Twenty-two inches long. Inhabits South America; perches on trees which overhang the water, and darts down on the fish as they swim underneath. It likewise feeds on crabs.\n\nGen. 50. SCOPUS, Umbre.\n\nBill thick, compressed, long and straight; nostrils linear and oblique; feet with four unconnected toes.\n\nTufted umbre.—With a crest; bill brown, with a longitudinal furrow on each side, in which are placed the nostrils; lower mandible narrower towards the end, and a little truncated; crest thick, tufted and lax; body brown; tail obscurely barred; legs length and brown. Female not crested. Twenty inches long. Inhabits Africa.\n\nGen. 51. ARDEA.\n\nBill straight, pointed, long, somewhat compressed, with a furrow from the nostrils towards the tip; nostrils linear; tongue sharp; feet four-toed, cleft; toes connected at the base.\n\nThe birds of this numerous genus have long feet and necks, and live on amphibious animals and fishes.\n\nA. Crested, and bill scarcely longer than the head.\n\nCrowned heron or crown bird.—Crest bristly and erect; temples with two naked wattles; bill brownish; irides gray; crown covered with short silky feathers; crest circular, yellowish, tipped with black; temples and wattles red; body bluish ash; wing coverts white, the greater ones reddish, those next the body blackish; tail and greater quill feathers black, the secondary bay; legs dusky. The female is black, where the male is bluish-ash, has no wattles on the throat, and the long feathers on the breast less conspicuous. This beautiful species, the balearic crane of Ray, and the crowned African crane of Edwards, is two feet nine inches long; and inhabits Africa, particularly the coast of Guinea, as far as the cape de Verd islands. At the latter it is said to be very tame, and so familiar as to come into the court-yards to feed with the poultry. It is supposed to feed chiefly on worms and vegetables, often sleeps on one leg, runs very fast, and not only flies well, but continues on wing for a long time together. The flesh is said to be very tough.\n\nDemoiselle heron, demoiselle of Numidia, or Numidian crane.—A tuft of long, white, pendant feathers behind each eye; bill yellowish; the base greenish, tip red; irides red; head and tips of the primary quill feathers black; feathers of the breast long and pendulous; crest over the eyes turned back; and pendulous; body bluish-ash; crown cinereous; head, neck, throat, breast and legs black. The wind-pipe does not, as in the generality of birds, go straight forwards into the lungs, but first enters a cavity in the keel of the breast bone, for about three inches, when it returns, after making a bend forwards, and then passes into the chest. This elegant species is about the size of the common crane; and three feet three inches long. It is found in many parts of Africa and Asia, but most plentifully about Bithynia, the ancient Numidia, and Tripoli. It also occurs at Aleppo, and in the southern plain, about the Black and Caspian seas, and not unfrequently beyond Lake Baikal, about the rivers Selenga and Argun, but never ventures to the northward. It affects marshes and rivers, subsisting chiefly on fish. In the Crimea it builds its nest in open plains, generally in the vicinity of the salt lakes. The young birds are brought to market by the Tartars, and are so susceptible of domestication, that they even afterwards breed in the farm yards. From the gentleness of its manners and the elegance of its form, it is often kept in menageries. In confinement, it often assumes strange and uncouth attitudes, and seems occasionally to imitate dancing; and Keyser mentions one in the gallery at Florence, which had been taught to dance to a certain tune, when played or sung to it.\n\nB. Cranes; head bald.\n\nCommon crane.—Hind head naked and papillose; cap and quill feathers black; body cinereous; innermost tail feathers jagged; bill greenish-black; front covered with black down; hind head red, with a few scattered hairs, and a cinereous area beneath; temples and upper neck white; legs black. There is a variety with the body white; and the lower part of the neck and quill feathers black; bill greenish black; front covered with black down; hind head red, with a few scattered hairs, and a cinereous area beneath; temples and upper neck white; legs black. Weighs near 10 pounds; length five feet. Inhabits Europe and Asia, and annually migrates in flocks to the southern parts of Asia and Africa, in autumn. The course of their flight is discovered by the loud noise which they make; for they soar to such a height as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye. Like the wild geese, they form themselves into different figures, describing a wedge, a triangle, or a circle. It is said that formerly they visited the fens and marshes of England, in great numbers; but they seem now, in a great measure, to have forsaken our island. They are seen in France in the spring and autumn; but generally only as passengers. They make their nests in marshes, and lay two bluish eggs. They feed on reptiles of all kinds, and on several sorts of vegetables, particularly green corn; among which, if a flock alights, it makes great havoc. Like other large birds, the crane has much difficulty in commencing its flight.\n\nSiberian crane.—White; temples and front naked, Gigantea; red, wrinkled; ten first quill feathers thinning black; bill and legs red. Stands four feet and a half high. Inhabits the marshy flats of Siberia, and feeds on reptiles, worms, and small fish.\nC. Storks; orbits naked.\n\nWhite stork.—White; orbits and quill feathers black; bill, legs and skin red; greater wing coverts black. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. Is about the size of a turkey; and measures three feet three inches in length. Feeds on fish and reptiles, and in several countries is protected for its use in destroying serpents. Vast numbers annually resort to some parts of Holland, and even as far north as Russia, to breed, but rarely visit England. They observe great exactness in the time of their autumnal departure from Europe to more favoured climes. They pass a second summer in Egypt, and the marshes of Barbary; pairing in the former country, and rearing a second brood. Before each of their migrations, they rendezvous in amazing numbers, and are for a while much in motion among themselves, till, after making several short excursions, as if to try their wings, they all on a sudden take flight with great silence, and with such speed as in a moment to be out of sight. At Bagdad, hundreds of their nests are to be seen about the houses, walls and trees; and at Persepolis, the remains of the pillars serve them to build on, every pillar having a nest on it. Shaw mentions flights of them leaving Egypt, and passing over Mount Carmel, each half a mile in breadth. The good-natured Dutchmen provide boxes for them to build their nests in, on the tops of their houses, and resent any injury done to the birds as an offence committed against themselves. The stork is of a mild and affectionate disposition; and though it has a grave air, yet, when roused by example, is not averse from gaiety. \"I saw,\" says Dr. Hermann, \"in a garden where children were playing at hide and seek, a tame stork join the party, run its turn when touched, and distinguish the child whose turn it was to pursue the rest, so well, as, along with the others, to be on its guard.\"—To this bird the ancients ascribed many of the moral virtues, as temperance, vigilance, conjugal fidelity, and filial and parental piety.\n\nBlack stork.—Brown; breast and belly white. Two feet nine inches long. Inhabits Europe and Asia. Feeds on fish and reptiles; is timid, and retires into thick woods and inaccessible fens.\n\nD. Herons; middle claw inwardly serrated.\n\nGigantic heron.—Glaucoous above; dirty white beneath; bill a little triangular. This is a large species, measuring from tip to tip of the wings, nearly 15 feet. The bill is of an enormous size, and 16 inches round at the base. The head and neck are naked, except a few straggling curled hairs. The feathers of the back and wings are of a bluish-grey colour, and very stout; those of the breast long. The craw hangs down the fore part of the neck, like a pouch, thinly covered with down. The belly is covered with a dirty white down, and the upper part of the back and shoulders surrounded with the same. The legs and about half of the thighs are naked, and the naked parts are full three feet in length. The gigantic heron inhabits Bengal, and is sometimes found on the coast of Guinea. It arrives in the interior parts of Bengal before the period of the rains, and retires as soon as the dry season commences. Though its aspect is far from inviting, it is one of the most useful birds of these countries, in clearing them of snakes and noxious reptiles and insects. They sometimes feed on fish; and one of them will generally devour as much as would serve four men. On opening the body of an individual of this species, a land tortoise, 10 inches long, and a large black cat, were found entire within it, the former in the pouch, and the latter in its stomach. Being unacquainted at the sight of mankind, they are soon rendered familiar; and when fish or other food is thrown to them they catch it very nimbly, and immediately swallow it entire. A young bird of this kind, about five feet in height, was brought up tame, and presented to the chief of the Banumas, where Mr. Smeathman lived. It regularly attended the hall at dinner time, placing itself behind its master's chair, frequently before any of the guests entered. The servants were obliged to watch it carefully, and to defend the provisions by beating it off with sticks: yet notwithstanding every precaution, it would frequently snatch off something from the table, and one day purloined a whole boiled fowl, which it swallowed in an instant. It used to fly about the island, and roost very high among the silk cotton trees; from this station, at the distance of two or three miles, it could see when the dinner was carried across the court; when darting down, it would arrive early enough to enter with some of those who carried in the dishes. When fitting, it was observed always to rest itself on the whole length of the hind part of the leg. Sometimes it would stand in the room for half an hour after dinner, turning its head alternately as if listening to the conversation. These birds are found in companies, and, when seen at a distance, near the mouths of rivers, advancing towards an observer, it is said that they may be easily mistaken for canoes on the surface of a smooth sea, and when on the sand banks, for men and women picking up shell-fish on the beach.—From their immense gape, they have obtained the name of large throats, and from their swallowing bones, that of bone eaters or bone takers.\n\nNight heron.—Crest on the hind head white, horizontal, of three feathers; back black; belly yellowish. The female has the head smooth and brown; belly brownish and white beneath; and the first quill feathers with a white spot at the tip. About 20 inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Only one instance occurs of its having been met with in England. It is pretty common in Russia, particularly on the Don, where it builds in trees, and is also met with at Africane during summer. It is said to lay three or four white eggs, and sometimes to build among the rocks. It has a very uncouth and rough voice, like that of a person straining to vomit.\n\nCrested purple heron.—Hind head black; crest pendent, and composed of two long feathers; body olive above, purplish beneath. Two feet 10 inches long. Inhabits Asia.\n\nAfrican heron.—Crested; body cinereous; neck breast and belly ferruginous; chin white; neck with three black lines; bill and legs yellow; crest of three long feathers; feathers of the breast and rump mixed with ferruginous; a broad black line from the nape to the back, and another on each of the sides. About three feet long; and smaller than the common heron. Inhabits Asia and Africa, and has been twice found in England.\n\nCommon heron.—Hind head with a pendent crest; Major. body ash-coloured; line on the neck beneath and pectoral bar black. The female has the hind head smooth and\nBlue heron.—Hind head crested; body blue; bill and lores blue; legs green. In the female, the head and neck are dull purple; the chin and middle of the throat white, and the back lead colour. There is a subfertile variety blue green, with the chin and throat white. Another is varied with brown, yellow and cinereous; fleck black above; white beneath; and wings and tail greenish. From 16 to 18 inches long. Inhabits America. Found in Carolina in spring, and in Jamaica, and other islands of the West Indies, in winter. It has also been met with at Otaheite, and other islands of the South seas, where it is much respected.\n\nSquacco heron.—Ferruginous; white beneath; hind Comata head with a long white pendent crest, edged with black. About 15 inches long. Inhabits Europe and Asia. A white variety, with a smooth head, the upper part, crown, breast and back, reddish, which inhabits Coromandel, has been once shot in England.\n\nBittern; in provincial English, bittour, bumpy co'st, Stellarius.\n\nButter bump and miredram.—Head smooth; body tefaceous above, with transverse spots; paler beneath, with oblong brown spots. About two feet and a half long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, afflicting the more temperate regions in winter, and migrating northwards in summer. Though not a plentiful species in Britain, it is occasionally found in the breeding season, in the less frequented reedy marshes, and swampy moors, well clothed with rushes, where it forms a nest on some lump, by collecting fedges or other coarse plants together. It lays four or five eggs of a light olive green colour, inclining to cinereous. At this season the male makes a singular bellowing noise, vulgarly supposed to be produced by the bird putting his bill into a reed. It is with difficulty roused from its lurking place, flies heavily, and frequently lights again at a small distance, so that it becomes an easy prey to the sportman. About sunset, it sometimes soars to a great height in the air, with a spiral ascent, making at the same time, a loud and singular noise. Its flesh is accounted a delicacy.\n\nGreater bittern.—Head smooth; body white; bill tawny; legs black; bill six inches long; irides yellowish; lores green. Three feet six inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Is rare in England.\n\nWattled heron.—Back, wings, legs and crown black-blue; smooth head and neck white; body black beneath; bill and chin carunculated. Five feet long. Inhabits Africa.\n\nMinute bittern.—Smooth head and upper part of the Exilis body reddish-bay; white beneath; sides of the neck rufous; wings and tail black. Twelve inches and a half long. Inhabits Jamaica.\n\nLittle bittern.—(Male). Head smooth; body brown; reddish beneath; tail feathers greenish-black; lores yellowish. (Female). Body brown; edges of the feathers reddish; reddish beneath; crown, back, wings and tail black; bill yellow-green; naked part of the face yellow; irides fawn; legs green brown. This beautiful species is scarcely larger than a fieldfare, and about 15 inches long, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail. The female lays four or five white eggs, of the size of those of the blackbird, and which are placed on...\nGrallae. a few dried flags on the ground. Inhabits Europe and Asia, but is rare in England.\n\nE. Bill gaping in the middle.\n\nPondicery heron.—Gray-ash; quill feathers long and black; middle claw not ferrated; bill yellow, thick at the base, pointed at the tip, and a little bent in, gaping in the middle; space between the bill and toes feathered; legs yellow. Fourteen inches and a half long. Inhabits India.\n\nCoromandel heron.—White; back, wings and tail black; upper mandible ferrated from the middle to the tip; bill yellow, thick at the base, and pointed at the tip; legs reddish-yellow; upper part of the head with black lines; lores and chin naked and black; irides red; toes connected at the base. Inhabits Coromandel, and feeds on fish and reptiles.\n\nScopaceous heron.—Brown; throat and breast streaked with white; chin and legs white; wings and tail copper-colour. Twenty-five inches long. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\nTantalus.\n\nGen. 52. TANTALUS, Ibis.\n\nCharacters. Bill long, subulated, roundish, somewhat arched; face naked; tongue short and broad; jugular pouch naked; nostrils oval; feet four-toed and palmated at the base.\n\nWood ibis.—Face bluish; bill reddish; legs, quill and tail feathers black; body white; bill nine inches long, yellowish-brown; irides reddish. The male has the head and neck naked, wrinkled and black-blue; and the female has the neck gray and downy. Three feet long. Inhabits New Holland and the warmer parts of America. Is stupid and slow in flight, sitting on trees, and feeding on herbs, seeds, fruits, fish, and reptiles. The flesh is good. Of this species there are two varieties, the first having the head and neck white, blended with yellow; the body black, and belly cinereous, and the second distinguished by white wing coverts, with a black blotch in the middle.\n\nGloppy ibis.—Head and neck black; legs green; body varied with gloopy-blue, blackish, green and claret; dark rufous beneath; quill and tail feathers green-gold; bill green. Thirteen inches and a half long. Inhabits Russia, and was once shot in Cornwall.\n\nBlack ibis.—Face, bill and legs red; body black. From 30 to 40 inches long. Inhabits Egypt.\n\nEgyptian ibis.—Face red; bill pale yellow; quill feathers black; body reddish-white. This is a large bird, somewhat exceeding the flor's, and measures from 30 to 40 inches in length. The bill is seven inches long, the colour yellow, growing reddish towards the tip, slightly curved, and ending in a blunt point. The fore part of the head, all round as far as the eyes, is naked and reddish. The skin under the throat, is also bare and dilatable; the plumage reddish white, most inclining to red on the back and wings; quills and tail black; the legs long; and the thighs bare for three parts of their length. Haffelquill adds, that the irises are whitish, and the end of the bill and the legs black; and that it is found in Lower Egypt, in great plenty, in places just freed from the inundations of the Nile. It lives on frogs and insects, and is seen in gardens morning and evening, and sometimes so abundantly, that whole palm trees are covered with them. When at rest they sit quite erect, Grallae. their tail touching their legs. The same author believes it to be the ibis of the ancients; first, because it is common in, and peculiar to Egypt; secondly, as it eats serpents; and, thirdly, because the urns, which contain the remains of embalmed birds, found in the sepulchres along with the mummies, seem to contain birds of this size. Its figure represented Egypt, in the hieroglyphic writing of its inhabitants. In that country it is still called Pharaoh's bird, and builds in the palm trees.\n\nScarlet ibis.—Face, bill and legs red; body scarlet; Ruber. wings tipped with black. Twenty-one inches long. Inhabits South America. Sits on trees, but lays its greenish eggs on the ground. The young are at first black, then gray, whitish just before they fly, and afterwards grow gradually red.\n\nWhite ibis.—This species is 22 inches long, and about Albus. the size of the whimbrel; the face, bill and feet reddish; Plate body white; tips of the wings green; the male and feccxcviii, male nearly alike. Native of Brazil, but towards the Fig. 2. end of summer migrates to the north, and is found in great numbers in the marshy lands of Carolina, feeding on fish and aquatic insects. Here they remain for about five weeks: the fat and flesh of the white ibis are said to be of a saffron colour, but though not much esteemed, is sometimes eaten.\n\nGen. 53. CORRIRA, Courier.\n\nBill short, straight, toothless; thighs longer than the Characters body; feet four-toed, palmated; hind toe unconnected.\n\nItalian courier.—Ferruginous above; white beneath; Italica. two middle tail feathers white, tipped with black; bill pale yellow, black at the end, with a large gap; irides a double circle of bay and white. Lets than the curlew. Inhabits Italy, and runs swiftly.\n\nGen. 54. SCOLOPAX.\n\nBill roundish, obtuse, and longer than the head; nostrils linear; face covered with feathers; feet four-toed; hind toe consisting of many joints.\n\nThe birds of this and of the succeeding genus are with difficulty ascertained, being subject to differ in appearance from sex and age, and their colours shading into one another. The markings of their feet, however, are pretty constant, and therefore afford one of the best criteria.\n\nPigmy curlew.—Arched bill, and legs black; body Pygmaea. varied with ferruginous, brown, and white; white beneath; rump white; quill and outer tail feathers edged with white. Size of a lark. Inhabits Europe, and is very rare in England.\n\nCommon curlew.—Bill arched, blackish; legs bluish; Arquata. wings blackish, with snowy spots; lower mandible reddish at the base; body above, and breast streaked with dusky brown; chin, rump, belly, and vent, white; quill feathers black, spotted with white within; legs bluish; toes flat and broad. This species is subject to vary considerably in size, weighing from 20 to upwards of 30 ounces; the length of the largest being about 25 inches. Inhabits the moist and fenny places of Europe, Asia, and Africa. A rufous and black variety, with a smaller body, and longer bill, occurs in America. The curlew\ncurlew is common on most of our coasts, in winter, when it is gregarious, and feeds on small crabs, and other marine insects and worms. In the spring it retires inland, and commonly to the more northern parts of the kingdom, to breed, resorting to the most retired situations on the heath-covered mountains, or in extensive and unfrequented marshes. It makes no nest; but deposits among the heath, rushes, or long grass, four eggs, of a pale olive colour, marked with brownish spots. The young make use of their legs as soon as they are hatched, but cannot fly for a considerable time. The flesh of this species is eatable, but is best in summer, when the bird feeds on frogs, worms, and water insects. In winter it is rank and fishy.\n\n**Whimbrel.**—Bill arched, and black; legs bluish; back with rhomboid brown spots; rump white; lower mandible reddish at the base; body above, and breast brownish, with dusky brown streaks; chin, rump, belly, and vent, white; tail brown, with dusky bars; quill feathers black, spotted with white on the inside. About half the size of the preceding; but agreeing with it in appearance and habits. It is also more scarce in this country.\n\n**Black snipe.**—Bill and legs red; body black. Inhabits the islands between Northern Asia and America.\n\n**Nodding snipe.**—Bill black; legs greenish; body cinereous; crown and upper part of the back dusky red, and streaked; the lower white, spotted with black. Size of the common snipe. Inhabits Labrador, and is constantly nodding the head.\n\n**Woodcock.**—Bill straight, reddish at the base; legs cinereous; thighs covered; head, with a black band on each side; upper mandible longer, reddish at the base; front cinereous; lower eyelid white; crown, neck above, back, and wing coverts, ferruginous, mixed with black and gray; chin pale ash; throat yellowish, with small dusky spots; body whitish beneath, with dusky lines; quill feathers dusky, with triangular rufous spots; tail rounded, cinereous at the tip; legs brownish. Length 15 inches; weight from 12 to 15 pounds. This well-known species is subject to great variety, and inhabits the northern countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa, migrating in winter to the more temperate regions. In Britain it seldom appears in numbers till about the middle of November; but some occasionally appear as early as the latter end of September, or beginning of October. They generally come to us with northerly or easterly winds, when the more northern countries become frozen; and if the frost in those parts where they breed is suddenly severe, large flights are sometimes met with on our coasts, where they remain for a day, to recruit their strength, and then disperse. In England they are not so plentiful as formerly, when the art of shooting flying was less practised. A great many, however, are yet to be found in the more uncultivated parts of Devonshire, Cornwall, and Wales, as well as in the north of Scotland; but they are nowhere so abundant as in the large tracts of woods in Ireland. In severe weather, they accumulate, from the moors and inland counties, to the woods in the west of England. It is one of the few winter birds that occasionally breed with us. It builds a nest of a few fibres, or dry leaves, on the ground, generally at the root of a tree, and lays four eggs, somewhat larger than those of a pigeon, of a yellowish-white, spotted and blotched with rufous brown and ash colour. Its usual food is insects and worms, for which it bores with its bill into moist places, feeding principally at night, when its call resembles that of the snipe. In some countries the woodcock remains the whole year, only moving, in the breeding season, from the plains to the mountains. In this country, it usually prepares for its departure about the middle of March, when flocks come down to the sea coast, and, if the wind is favourable, are soon out of sight; but if it be contrary, they linger till it change.\n\n**Little woodcock.**—Bill straight; legs brownish; front cinereous; hind head black, with four transverse yellowish lines; chin white; body above black, waved with light tawny; yellow beneath. Eleven inches and a half long. Inhabits America. Its flesh is reckoned exquisite.\n\n**Great snipe.**—Legs and crown black, the latter with a pale divided line down the middle, a pale streak above and beneath the eyes; body varied above, white beneath; bill like that of the woodcock; lower feathers of the body, except the middle of the belly, edged with black; quill feathers dusky; tail feathers reddish, and except the two middle ones, with black lines. Weighs about eight ounces; length 16 inches. Inhabits Siberia, and very rarely England.\n\n**Common snipe.**—Bill straight, tuberculated; legs brown; body varied with blackish and tawny, white beneath; front with four brown lines; crown, bill, ocular band, and wings black; chin pale rusty; tail feathers black at the base; rump variegated. The weight of this species is about four ounces, and the length nearly 12 inches. It is met with, in marlily situations, in almost every part of the world, and is very plentiful in our own island. In very wet times it resorts to the hills; but more generally frequents the marshes of the plains, where it can penetrate the earth with its bill, in quest of worms. Some few remain with us the whole year, and breed in the more extensive marshes and mountainous bogs. The nest is made of the materials around it, as coarse grass, or heath, and placed on a dry spot, near a splat or swampy place, the eggs, like that of the lapwing, being much pointed, and invariably placed with their smaller ends inwards. In the breeding season the snipe changes its note entirely. The male will keep on the wing for an hour together, mounting like a lark, uttering a shrill piping note, and then descend with great velocity, making a bleating sound, like that of an old goat, which is alternately repeated round the spot pecked by the female, especially while she is fitting on her nest. The young ones run off soon after they are freed from the shell; but they are attended by the parent birds, until their bills have acquired a sufficient firmness to enable them to provide for themselves. When undisturbed in its retreats, the snipe walks leisurely, with its head erect, and keeps moving the tail at short intervals. But it is rarely observed in this state of tranquillity, being extremely watchful, and perceiving the sportsman, or his dog, at a great distance, and either concealing itself among the variegated withered herbage, so similar in appearance to its own plumage, that it is almost impossible to discover it, or, as happens more frequently, springing and taking flight beyond the reach of the gun. When first disturbed it utters a kind of feeble whistle, and generally flies against the wind, turning nimbly in a zig-zag direction,\nand sometimes soaring almost out of sight. From its vigilance and manner of flying, it is very difficult to shoot; but some sportsmen can draw it within range of their fowling-piece, by imitating its cries, and others are contented to catch it in the night by springs. The snipe is much esteemed as a delicious and well-flavoured dish; and though it is very fat it rarely disagrees even with the weakest stomach.\n\nJack-snipe, jadock, or gil.—Bill straight, tuberculated; body variegated; legs greenish; lores brown; rump varied with violet; bill black; body variegated with tawny, black, violet, and glossy green; head with pale yellow and black lines, reaching from the bill to the hind head; breast spotted; belly and vent white. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Is found in the same places with the preceding, but is more solitary and rare. It will lie among rushes, or other thick covert, till in danger of being trampled on, and, when roused, seldom flies far. It comes to us later than the common snipe, and is never known to remain in this country during the breeding season. It is as much esteemed as the snipe, and is cooked in the same manner.\n\nGreenhank.—Bill straight, the lower base red; body beneath snowy; legs greenish; bill black; the lower mandible bending a little upwards; eyebrows and lower part of the back white; head, neck, and back, pale cinereous; shafts of the feathers spotted with brown; quill feathers dusky, spotted with white on the inside; tail white, with dusky lines; legs very long. Weight about six ounces; length 14 inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Is sometimes seen, in small flocks, on our coasts, in winter; as also in the marshes and fens contiguous to the sea. Some few are supposed to remain with us all the summer, and to breed in our fens. The greater part, however, retire northward to breed, and are found in Sweden, Russia, and Siberia. Their flesh, like all the rest of this genus, is well-flavoured, and reckoned good eating.\n\nRedhank, or pool-snipe.—Bill straight, red; legs scarlet; secondary quill feathers white; bill black towards the tip; irides reddish-brown; head and neck cinereous above; back and shoulders greenish-brown; wing coverts cinereous, mixed with dusky and brown, and spotted with whitish; secondary quill feathers, except the two inner ones, white towards the tip; primary dusky, the four or five inner ones tipped with white; line over the eyes white; a dusky spot between the bill and eyes; short dusky streaks on the chin and throat; under part of the body and rump white, with small dusky spots; each of the tail feathers with 12 or 13 transverse black lines. Weighs about five ounces, and is 12 inches long. Inhabits Europe and America. Is not uncommon in some parts of England, rearing the greater part of the year in the fen countries, where it breeds and rears its young. It lays four eggs, which are whitish, tinged with olive, and marked with irregular spots of black, chiefly on the thicker end. When disturbed it flies round its nest, making a noise like a lapwing. It is not so common on the sea shores as several of its congeners, and is of a solitary disposition, being mostly seen alone, or only in pairs.\n\nSpotted snipe, red-legged godwit, or spotted redhank.—Blackish, with white spots; white beneath; lines on the breast and bands on the lateral tail feathers blackish; legs red. Size of the greenhank. Inhabits Europe, frequenting the banks of rivers, and feeding on the smaller shell-fish and other vermes. Seldom visits Britain.\n\nLesser godwit, jadreka snipe, or stone plover.—Bill inclining a little upwards at the point, red at the base; body gray brown, varied with rufous; white beneath; quill feathers white at the base, the four first without spots; tail white at the base; irides whitish; cheeks reddish; back brown; quill feathers blackish; feathers round the bill reddish-white. Seventeen inches long, and weighs nine ounces. Inhabits the north of Europe, and is gregarious; but seldom occurs in Britain.\n\nRed godwit, or red-breasted godwit.—Bill a little recurved, yellowish; legs black; body reddish-rufous beneath; bill blackish at the tip, head, neck, breast and body, ferruginous above, and, except the neck, streaked with black; lower part of the back and rump rufous white; greater quill feathers black without, the base white within; secondary and tail feathers half black and half white. Weight about 12 ounces; length 18 inches. There is a variety with the head and neck cinereous, and the chin and belly white. Inhabits Europe and America, and is gregarious, but rarely seen with us.\n\nCommon or gray godwit.—Bill straight, reddish-yellow; legs greenish; head and neck reddish; three of the quill feathers black, with a white base; a broad white streak from the bill to the eye; body reddish-brown above; feathers with a dusky spot in the middle. Subject to very considerable variety both in size and plumage. In general, it weighs from seven to twelve ounces, and measures from 15 to 16 inches. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa; continues with us the whole year, and retires to the fens in spring for breeding. In the winter it is found on our shores, particularly at the mouths of large rivers and inlets, where the mud and sand become bare at low water, and where it feeds on insects. It is much esteemed by epicures as a great delicacy, and sells very high. It is caught in nets, to which it is allured by a flake, or stuffed bird, in the same manner, and at the same season as the ruffs and reeves.\n\nGodwit.—Brown, edged with whitish; neck whitish; Leucophaea. with small brown spots; chin and belly white; quill feathers with black bands; bill a little turned up, brown, with a purple base; tail feathers white; the two middle ones wholly, the rest barred with brown on the outer side. Sixteen inches long. Inhabits Europe. Regarded by some ornithologists as only a variety of the egoccephala.\n\nCineraceus godwit.—Legs long, cinereous; head, neck, and back varied with cinereous and white; chin and breast white, spotted with ash; bill thicker than in the greenhank; tail with cinereous lines. Size of the greenhank. Inhabits Lincolnshire; but is very rare, and seems to be imperfectly known.\n\nCambridge godwit.—Legs orange; bill red; body Cantabrigi-brown ash above, white beneath; wing coverts brown, edged with white and barred with black; quill feathers blackish, white within; the secondary barred with white. Larger than the redhank. Was shot near Cambridge, and first described by Pennant. Gen. 55.\nGen. 55. Tringa, Sandpiper.\n\nBill roundish, as long as the head; nostrils furall, li-\nnear; tongue slender; feet four-toed; hind toe of\none joint, and raised from the ground.\n\nThe birds of this genus frequent the plains and shores,\nand hardly touch the ground with their back toe.\n\nRuff and reeve.—Bill and legs rufous; three lateral\ntail feathers without spots; face with flesh-coloured gra-\nmulations; bill sometimes black or yellowish; irides ha-\nzel; back of the neck with a large tuft of feathers,\nwhich fall off in moulting season. Female pale brown;\nback spotted with black; tail brown; the middle fea-\nthers spotted with black; breast and belly white. The\nruffs, or males, are so very variable in their markings,\nthat two are seldom found alike. Buffon mentions that\nKlein compared above 100 ruffs together, and found on-\nly two that were similar. About one foot long. Inha-\nbits Europe and Siberia. The male does not acquire\nthe ornament of his neck till the second season, and be-\nfore that time, is not easily distinguished from the fe-\nmale, except by being larger. After moulting, at the\nend of June, he loses his ruff and the red tubercles of\nhis face; and from that time, till the spring of the year,\nhe again, in plumage, looks like his mate. These birds\nleave our island in the winter, and are then supposed to\nassociate with other congenerous species. In the spring,\nas soon as they arrive again in England, and take up\ntheir abode in the fens where they were bred, each of\nthe males (of which there appears to be a much greater\nnumber than of females) immediately fixes on a particu-\nlar dry or grassy spot in the marsh, about which he runs\nround and round, until it is trodden bare, withering, appa-\nrently, to invite the female to take joint possession, and be-\ncome an inmate. As soon as a single female arrives, and\nis heard or observed by the males, her feeble cry seems\nto rouse them all to war; for they instantly begin to\nfight; and their combats are described as being both\ndexterous and of long continuance, the female, at the\nend of the battle, remaining the prize of the victor. It\nis at the time of these battles, that they are caught in\nthe greatest numbers in the nets of the fowlers. They\nare also at other times caught by day nets, and are\ndrawn together by means of a stuffed reeve, which is\nplaced in some suitable spot for that purpose. The ruff\nis much prized as a delicious dish, and is sought after\nwith great eagerness by the fowlers who live by catch-\ning them and other fen birds, for the markets of the me-\ntropolis, &c. Before they are offered for sale, they are\ncommonly put up to feed, for about a fortnight, on boil-\ned wheat, and bread and milk, mixed with hemp-feed, to\nwhich sugar is sometimes added; in consequence of\nwhich mode of treatment they soon get very fat. In the\nbeginning of May the female makes her nest in a dry\ntuft of grass, in the fens, and lays four white eggs,\nmarked with rusty spots.\n\nLapwing, pewit, bearded plover, &c.—Legs red;\ncrest pendent; breast black; bill black; irides hazel;\ncrown thinning black; crest on the hind head four inches\nlong; cheeks and sides of the neck white; a black line\nbeneath each eye; throat black; hind part of the neck\nmixed with white, ash colour, and red; back and fea-\npulvers glossy green; some of the feathers with ferrug-\ninous tips; lesser wing coverts thinning black, blue and\ngreen; greater quill feathers black, the four first with\na white spot at the end; lesser black on the upper half,\nwhite on the lower; belly white; vent and tail coverts\norange; outer tail feathers white; the rest on the lower\nhalf black, tipped with dirty white; upper white. Weighs\nbetween seven and eight ounces. Is found in most parts\nof Europe, as far north as Iceland; and in the winter is\nmet with in Persia and Egypt. The chief food of the\nlapwings is worms; and sometimes they may be seen in\nflocks nearly covering the low marshy grounds in search\nof these, which they draw with great dexterity from\ntheir holes. When the bird meets with one of those\nrolls of earth that are thrown out by the perforations of\nthe worm, it first gently removes the mould from the\nmouth of the hole, then strikes the ground at the side\nwith its foot, and steadily and attentively waits the re-\nsult; while the reptile, alarmed by the shock, emerges\nfrom its retreat, and is instantly seized. In the evening,\nthe lapwings pursue a different plan, running along the\ngrass, and feeling under their feet the worms, which\nnow come forth, invited by the coolness of the air.\nThus they obtain a plentiful meal, and afterwards wash\ntheir bill and feet in the small pools or rivulets. They\nremain in this country the whole year. The female lays\nfour olive-coloured eggs, spotted with black, on the dry\nground, near some marsh, on a little bed of dry grass\nwhich she prepares. She sits about three weeks, and\nthe young are able to run within two or three days after\nthey are hatched. The parent exhibits the greatest at-\ntachment to them, and has recourse to very amusing ar-\ntifices to allure boys and dogs from approaching them.\nIn place of waiting the arrival of the enemies at the\nnest, the boldly rushes out to meet them. When as\nnear as the dare venture, she rises from the ground with\na loud screaming voice, as if just flushed from hatching,\nthough, probably, at the same time, not within 100\nyards of her nest. She then flies with great clamour\nand apparent anxiety, whining and screaming round the\ninvaders, striking at them with her wings, and some-\ntimes fluttering as if she was wounded. To complete\nthe deception, she becomes still more clamorous as she\nretires from the nest. If very near, she appears alto-\ngether unconcerned; and her cries cease in proportion\nas her fears are increased. When approached by dogs, she\nflies heavily, at a little distance before them as if maim-\ned, still clamorous and bold, but never offering to move\ntowards the quarter where her young are stationed. The\ndogs pursue, in expectation every moment of seizing the\nparent, and by this means actually lose the young; for\nthe young cunning bird, having thus drawn them off to\na proper distance, exerts her powers, and leaves her\nastonished pursuers to gaze at the rapidity of her flight.\nThese birds, when tamed, clear gardens of worms and\nsnails. Their flesh and eggs are both reckoned delicacies\nfor the table. In winter they join in large flocks,\nbut are then very shy.\n\nGambet, gambet sandpiper, or red-legged horsemans.—Gambetta.\nBill and legs red; body variegated with pale yellow,\nand cinereous; white beneath; bill tipped with black;\nirides yellowish-green; wing-coverts and scapulars cine-\nreous, and edged with yellow; first quill and tail fea-\nthers dusky, the latter edged with yellow. About the\nsize of the greenshank. Inhabits the northern parts of\nEurope and America, but seldom occurs in France or\nEngland.\n**ORNITHOLOGY**\n\n*Wheatear sandpiper.*—Blackith-thigh; chin and middle of the belly white; base of the bill and legs red. Eight inches and a half long. Inhabits Glamorganshire and Caerphillyshire.\n\n*Turton's Hebridean sandpiper,* or *sea-dottrel.*—Legs red; body black, varied with white, and ferruginous; breast and belly white; bill black, a little turned up at the tip; cheeks and neck black above; tail black in the middle, and white at the ends. Female more dusky; head varied with brown and whitish; neck blackish above. Though these are the usual characteristics, the species is very subject to varieties. About the size of a thrush; length nine inches and a half, and weight rather more than four ounces. Inhabits the sea coasts of Europe and America. Though not known to breed with us, it visits some of our shores in August, and departs in spring. The name has been given it from its manner of turning up the stones in search of worms and marine insects. It makes a flight net on the dry ground or land, and lays four olive-colored eggs, spotted with black. This species is not uncommon in the north of Scotland.\n\n*Striated sandpiper.*—Base of the bill and legs yellow; tail feathers white, barred with brown; most of the quill feathers white. Nearly 11 inches long. Inhabits Europe and North America. Feeds on shell-fish and mollusca, which it searches for at the ebb of the tides, and on insects which it catches, hanging over the water like a swallow.\n\n*Spotted sandpiper.*—Base of the bill and legs flesh color; all the body spotted; eyebrows and double band on the wings white; bill dusky; body above greenish-brown, white, with dusky spots beneath; two middle tail feathers greenish-brown, the rest white, with dusky lines. Female without spots beneath. About the size of a thrush, and eight inches long. Inhabits Europe and North America; is migratory, and is sometimes, though rarely, found in Britain.\n\n*Ash-colored sandpiper.*—Cinerous above, white beneath; legs dusky green; head spotted with black; neck with dusky streaks; back and wing-coverts with concentric black semicircles, varied with cinereous and white; tail coverts black and white; tail cinereous, edged with white; breast spotted with black; membrane surrounding the toes narrow and toothed. Length about 10 inches; weight from four ounces and a quarter to five and three quarters. This species, like most of the tribe, is subject to considerable variety. It inhabits Europe and America; visits some parts of our coasts, in large flocks, in winter, and departs about the latter end of March or beginning of April.\n\n*Brown sandpiper.*—Pale brown, spotted with black above, white beneath; fore part of the neck streaked with black; tail cinereous; wing-coverts edged with whitish; bill and legs black. Size of a jack-snipe. Inhabits England, but is very scarce.\n\n*Black sandpiper.*—White, varied with gray and brown spots above, with oblong brown and black spots beneath; two middle tail feathers all black. Size of a thrush. Inhabits England, chiefly in Lincolnshire.\n\n*Gray phalarope,* or *great coot-footed tringa.*—Bill fulvulate, and bent in at the tip; feet pinnate; breast varied with white; bill black; front white; crown dusky; neck pale ash above; back, rump, and shoulders dove-color, with dusky spots; wing-coverts and quill feathers brown; breast and belly white; tail dusky, edged with cinereous; legs black; membrane round the toes indented. Size of the common purre; weight one ounce. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Congregates about the borders of the Caspian sea, and is not common in Britain. In stormy weather, it swims in numbers on lakes; but in fine weather, is solitary among the fens.\n\n*Red phalarope,* or *cock footed tringa.*—Bill sub-fulvulated, bent in at the tip; feet pinnate; breast cinereous; sides of the neck ferruginous; bill black; band through the eyes blackish; bar on the wings white; rump with blackish bands. The female is gray above, rufous beneath, with the eyebrows and base of the tail reddish, and the rump white; bill yellowish; band above the eyes reddish; bar on the wings white, and the rump spotted with blackish. Eight inches long. Inhabits northern Europe and America; but is rarely met with in our own country. These birds go in pairs, and catch insects in the water with their bill. They do not dive, and are but bad swimmers. The female makes her nest on dry ground, and lays four eggs.\n\n*Alpine sandpiper,* or *dunlin.*—Brown tellaceous; breast blackish; tail feathers whitish-ash; legs brownish; belly white; two middle tail feathers a little longer. Weighs from nine to eleven drams; length of the largest eight inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, and is not uncommon on our own coasts during great part of the year. The female lays four eggs, of a dirty white, blotched with brown round the thicker end, and marked with a few small spots of the same colour on the smaller end.\n\n*Green,* or *wood sandpiper.*—Bill dotted at the tip; legs greenish; back brown green; belly and outer tail feathers white; bill greenish; crown and hind head dusky ash; rump variegated; eyebrows white. Inhabits Europe, North America, and Siberia. This elegant species weighs about three ounces and a quarter; length full 10 inches. It is by no means plentiful in Britain, and, except in pairing time, lives solitary. It is never seen near the sea; but frequents rivers, lakes, and other fresh waters. It runs on the shores, or skims the surface of the water. It utters a cry as it rises, and sometimes dives when pursued by the buzzard. It feeds on the fry of small fishes and worms. Though its flesh tastes somewhat of musk, it is considered as a great delicacy. It comes to us about the middle of September, and leaves us as late as the end of April, when it departs northward to breed.\n\n*Skore sandpiper.*—Smooth bill, and legs cinereous; quill feathers brown, the shaft of the first frothy. Near 11 inches long. Inhabits Europe; and is ranked by some ornithologists among British birds.\n\n*Greenwich sandpiper.*—Body varied above; neck cinereous beneath; belly, vent, and sides of the rump cinereous; white; bill black; legs greenish; crown brown, streaked with black; neck ash-colored beneath; back and wing-coverts brown ferruginous, edged with whitish; hind part of the back, rump, and lesser wing-coverts cinereous; tail cinereous, the feathers waved towards the tip, which is pale rusty. Size of the preceding, but very rare. The circumstance of one having been shot near Greenwich, has given rise to the trivial name.\n\n*Sea,* or *selinger sandpiper.*—Varied above with gray and black, white beneath; legs yellow; middle of the back...\nback violet; throat and tail dusky; four outer tail feathers very short, and edged with white. Size of a flake. Inhabits Norway and Iceland. A small flock of this species, consisting of 10 or 12, was once observed, some years ago, near Bexhill, on the 9th of December.\n\n**Common sandpiper.**—Bill smooth; legs livid; body cinereous, with black stripes, white beneath; bill brown; irides hazel; head brown, with black streaks; eyebrows white; neck cinereous above; back and wings greenish-brown, with numerous, narrow, dusky lines; quill feathers brown, and, except the first, with a white spot within; tail rounded, and glossy-green brown. Weight about two ounces; length seven inches and a half. Inhabits Europe and America. Visits this country in the spring, chiefly frequenting our lakes and rivers, on the borders of which it makes a nest composed of moss and dried leaves, and most commonly placed in a hole in the bank. It lays four or five eggs of a dirty white, marked with dusky and cinereous spots, mostly at the larger end. When disturbed, it makes a piping noise as it flies; and, when running on the ground, the tail is constantly in motion. In autumn it is liable to be much infested with the *hippopotamus hirundinis*.\n\n**Knot.**—Bill broad; legs ash-coloured; primary quill feathers ferruginous; outermost tail feather white, without spots; bill dusky ash; irides hazel; lores dusky; eyebrows and band on the wings white; body cinereous above, white beneath; lower wing-coverts tipped with white; chin and breast with minute spots; belly and vent with dusky lines; rump with brown femoralics. Nine inches long, and weighs four ounces and a half. Inhabits Europe and America. In Lincolnshire, and the other fenney districts of England, it is caught, in great numbers, by nets, into which it is decoyed by carved wooden figures to represent itself. It is also fattened for sale, and esteemed by many equal to the ruff in the delicacy of its flavour. The season for taking it is from August to November, after which the froth compels it to disappear. This bird is said to have been a favourite dish with Canute king of England; and Camden remarks that its name is derived from his.\n\n**Stint, purree, or wanderling.**—Bill and legs black; lores white; body and rump gray and brown; head and neck pale cinereous above, with brown streaks; back and wing-coverts brownish-ash, the greater tipped with white; throat white, mixed with brown; breast and belly white; two middle tail feathers more dusky, the rest edged with white; the legs are sometimes brown. The country people frequently call it *ox-lark, ox-eye, leaf-snipe, sea-lark*, or *wagtail*. It is nearly eight inches in length, and weighs about an ounce and three quarters. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. During winter it is found on all our coasts, appearing in vast flocks, and especially affecting the flat sandy shores and inlets. They leave us in April, though it is suspected that some remain with us all the year. These birds run nimbly near the edges of the flowing and retiring waves, and are almost perpetually wagging their tails, while they are, at the same time, busily employed in picking up their food, which consists chiefly of small worms and insects. On taking flight, they give a kind of scream, and skim along the surface of the water with great rapidity, as well as with great regularity, not flying directly forward, but performing their evolutions in large semi-circles, alternately approaching the shore and the sea in their sweep, the curvature of their course being indicated by the flocks appearing suddenly and alternately in a dark or in a snowy-white colour, as their backs or their bellies are turned to or from the spectator.\n\n**Little sandpiper.**—Bill and legs brown; body reddish buff beneath; outer tail feathers with a white shaft; rump variegated; tail tipped with black; greater wing-coverts and quill feathers brown, tipped with white; tail dusky; breast and belly white. About the size of a hedge-sparrow, and between five and six inches long. Inhabits Northern Europe and Nootka Sound; and has been once or twice killed in England.\n\n**Gray sandpiper.**—Bill black; legs greenish; body Squatarola gray, white beneath; head, back, and wing-coverts, edged with greenish-ash; cheeks and chin with oblong dusky spots, and with the belly and rump white; tail barred with black and white. Weight about 7 ounces; length 12 inches. Inhabits Europe and America. Is not plentiful on our shores, seldom more than five or seven being seen in a flock, and all of them retiring northward to breed. In Siberia and Carolina, it is said to be found in large flocks.\n\n**Red, or Aberdeen sandpiper.**—Bill and legs brown; body Squatarola ferrugineous beneath; secondary quill feathers edged with white; body thickly sprinkled with black and ferruginous above; wing-coverts white on the outer edge; rump and vent whitish, the former waved with black, the latter with a few black streaks; quill feathers black, with white shafts; tail feathers cinereous, with white shafts. From eight to ten inches long. Inhabits the north of Europe and America. Sometimes appears in great flocks on the coasts of Essex and the north of Scotland. In summer it frequents the neighbourhood of the Caspian sea, and also the river Don. It is perpetually running up and down on the sandy banks, picking up insects and small worms, on which it feeds.\n\n**Gen. 56. Charadrius, Plover.**\n\n**Bill roundish, obtuse, straight; nostrils linear; feet formed for running, three toed.**\n\nThe birds of this genus frequent the mouths of rivers, and the neighbourhood of torrents, and seem to enjoy rainy weather. From this last circumstance is derived their French name *pluvier*, and the English *plover*.\n\n**Ring plover, ring dotterel, or sea lark.**—Breast black; front blackish, with a white band; crown brown; legs yellow; upper half of the bill orange, lower black; irides hazel; body gray-brown above, white beneath; eggs bluish-white, with small round purplish spots. Of this species there is also a gray variety, with the collar and belly white; and another gray-ash, with the front and collar white, and the lower half of the tail black, tipped with rusty; the former inhabiting Spain, and the latter America. The more common sort is a native of both Europe and America, and is a well known visitant of our shores in summer; usually arriving in spring, and migrating in autumn, or at least retiring to the more inland parts of the country. It weighs about two ounces, and is between seven and eight inches long. It pairs early in May, and makes no nest, but lays four eggs in a small cavity in the sand, just above high-water mark. They are of a cinereous brown, marked all over with small black and ash-coloured spots. It is to be remark-\nthat these and other birds which lay invariably only four eggs on the ground, place them so as to occupy the least possible space, that is, with their small ends touching each other as a centre. The ringed plover is greatly attached to its young, and will practise various deceptions to save them from men and dogs; sometimes fluttering along the ground as if crippled, and sometimes seeming to tumble head over heels repeatedly, till it has enticed its enemy to a distance from its young, and then it flies off.\n\n**Nobby plover.**—Bands on the breast, neck, front, and cheeks white; tail pale yellow, with a black bar; legs yellow. Between nine and ten inches long. Inhabits America. Is very restless and clamorous.\n\n**Dotterel.**—Breast ferruginous; band over the eyes, and line on the breast white; legs black; bill black, depressed in the middle; front mixed with dusky and gray; hind head black, temples and chin white; upper part of the neck, back and wings, gray-brown; line across the breast white; middle of the belly black, reddish-white below; greater quill feathers brown, and some of them edged with white; tail olive brown, with a dusky band near the end, and tipped with white. The female is distinguished by a dusky band over the eyes, and brown crown. The crown of this species is sometimes varied with white, gray-brown, and yellowish; the body beneath yellowish, mixed with white; the two middle tail feathers brown, and the lateral ones white. Weight between four and five ounces; length nearly ten inches. Inhabits Europe, and makes this island a resting place in its migratory flights to and from its breeding place. It is seen on some of our downs, heaths, and moors, from April to the beginning of June; returns again in September, and remains till November. On the Wildfire downs, it resorts to the new fown corn or fallow-ground, for the sake of worms and beetles, its principal food. In the autumn it flies in flocks of five, six, or more. It is a stupid bird, and easily shot, but much esteemed for the delicacy of its flesh.\n\n**Long-legged plover, or long shanks.**—White; back and wings black; bill black, longer than the head; legs red, and very long; bill black, slender, tapering to a sharp point, the upper mandible a little longer than, and bent over, the lower; irides red; neck dusky spots above. There is a variety with white and black wings, and the tail feathers white. This extraordinary species is certainly the longest legged bird, in proportion to its bulk, hitherto known; the length from the apex of the bill to the end of the tail being thirteen inches, and from that to the end of the toes, five inches more. It is rare in Britain, and in many parts of Europe, so that its manners are very imperfectly known. According to Latham, it is common in Egypt, being found there in the marshes in October. Its food is said to consist principally of flies. It is likewise plentiful about the salt lakes, and often seen on the shores of the Caspian sea, as well as by the rivers which empty themselves into it, and in the southern deserts of Independent Tartary. It is also often met with in the warmer parts of America, and sometimes in Jamaica.\n\n**Hooded plover.**—Bill and feet red; face naked, having a yellowish carunculated membrane; head and part of the neck black; hind head furnished with a few short pointed feathers hanging like a crest; beneath white; body above rufous gray; under part white. Ten and a half inches long. Native of Senegal.\n\n**Gen. 57. Recurvirostra, Avocet.**\n\nBill depressed, subulate, recurved, pointed, flexible at the tip; feet palmated, four toed, hind toe not connected, very short, and placed high up; nostrils narrow, pervious; tongue short.\n\nOf this singular genus there are only three species, of which the first inhabits Europe.\n\n**Scooping avocet.**—In provincial English, butter-flip, avocetta, feooper, yelper, picarint, crooked bill, cobler's awl, &c. Variegated with white and black; bill three inches and a half long; irides hazel; c. own black, a white spot behind and beneath the eyes; rest of the head, neck, back, exterior part of the wings, lesser quill feathers, tail, and under part of the body white; inner scapulars and greater quill feathers without and at the tips black; legs bluish, and very long membrane connecting the toes indented. Resides in the temperate parts of Europe; weighing thirteen ounces, and measuring, from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail, eighteen inches. It breeds in the fens of Lincolnshire, and on Romney Marsh, in Kent. The female lays two white eggs, tinged with green, and marked with large black spots. In winter these birds assemble in small flocks of six or seven, and frequent the shores, particularly the mouths of large rivers, in search of worms and marine insects, which they scoop out of the mud or sand. They seem to be particularly fond of the cancer pulex, or locust. By means of their long legs, they run over shores that are covered five or six inches with water. In their movements they are lively, alert, volatile, and difficult to catch. When the female is frightened off her nest, the counterfeiters lament; and, when a flock is disturbed, they fly with their necks stretched out, and their legs extended behind, over the head of the spectator, making a shrill noise, and uttering a yelping cry of twit, twit, all the time.\n\n**American avocet.**—Head and neck reddish; back black, white beneath. Fourteen inches long. Inhabits North America and New Holland.\n\n**White avocet.**—White; lower wing coverts brownish; bill orange; legs brown. Fourteen inches and a half long. Inhabits Hudson's bay.\n\n**Gen. 58. Haematopus.**\n\nBill compressed, the tip an equal wedge; nostrils linear; tongue a third part as long as the bill; feet formed characters for running, three toed, cleft.\n\n**Sea pie, or pied oyster catcher.**—Bill, eyelids, and legs red, the former sometimes tipped with black; irides scarlet; body sometimes totally black; frequently the head, neck, and body above, black; white beneath; a small white spot under the eyes; breast with a white semicircular band; middle wing coverts at the tips, and greater, entirely white; quill feathers spotted with white on the inside; tail from the middle to the base white, lower half black; claws black. Weight seventeen ounces, length fifteen inches. Inhabits almost every sea shore, but seems never to quit the coast. Congregates in small flocks in winter, and chiefly subsists on marine insects.\nfeet and shell-fish, especially on oysters, which it seizes with great dexterity. It makes no nest, but deposits its eggs on the bare ground, above high-water mark. The eggs are generally four, of an olivaceous brown, blotched with black, and somewhat larger than those of the lapwing. The male is very watchful at the time of incubation, and on the least alarm, flies off with a loud scream, and the female instantly runs from her eggs to some distance, and then takes wing. It is a shy bird, but becomes bolder when the young are hatched. The latter are capable of running as soon as they quit the egg, and are led by their parents to their proper food. The young are easily tamed.\n\nGen. 59. Glareola, Pratincole.\n\nBill strong, short, straight, and hooked at the tip; nostrils at the base of the bill, linear and oblique; gap of the mouth large; feet four-toed, toes long, slender, connected at the base by a membrane; tail forked, consisting of twelve feathers.\n\nAurifrons pratincola.—Gray-brown above; collar black; chin and throat white; breast and belly reddish-gray. Very subject to vary in its plumage. Inhabits the heaths of northern Europe. About nine inches long. Feeds on worms and aquatic insects; is very restless and clamorous, and lays about seven eggs.\n\nSenegal pratincola.—Bill, legs, and whole body brown. Nine inches and a half long. Inhabits near the Senegal, and also Siberia.\n\nSpotted pratincola.—Brown, spotted with white; lower part of the belly and vent reddish-white, with black spots; bill and legs black. Size of the aurifrons. Inhabits Germany.\n\nGen. 60. Fulica.\n\nBill convex; upper mandible arched over the lower at the edge; lower gibbous near the tip; nostrils oblong; front bald; feet four-toed and sub-pinnated.\n\nBirds of this tribe frequent waters and feed on worms, insects, and small fish. They have a compressed body; the bill thick, and bent in towards the tip; the upper mandible reaching far up the forehead, and the wings and tail short. They are divided into gallinules or water hens, and coots. The former have the feet cleft; the upper mandible membranaceous at the base, and the wings concave; while the latter have the toes surrounded by a falcated membrane; the mandibles equal; nostrils oval, narrow and short.\n\nA. Feet cleft. Gallinule.\n\nCommon gallinule, or moor hen.—Front tawny; bracelets red; body blackish; bill red, with a greenish tip; irides red; body footy above, mixed with olive; cinereous beneath; outer edge of the wings and lower tail-coverts white; legs greenish; toes flat and broadish. Weighs from 14 to 16 ounces; length 14 inches. Inhabits Europe and America, and is a very common species, being found in most fedgy and flow rivers, or streams of water, and frequently in ponds abounding in weeds, where it can lie concealed. It feeds principally on insects, seeds, and vegetable productions of various sorts, in quest of which it frequently quits the water. It runs fast, and is equally expert in swimming and diving, but flies heavily, and with its legs hanging down. As it runs or swims, it is continually flitting up the tail, when the white underneath is very conspicuous. The nest is made of flags or rushes, and placed near the surface of the water, on some branch of a tree or bush, and sometimes on the stump of an old willow. The eggs are commonly five or six, but sometimes nine or ten, of a light yellowish brown, marked with rufi-coloured spots. The young are hatched in about three weeks, and instantly take the water. This species breeds twice or thrice in the course of a season. Its flesh is reckoned delicious.\n\nPurple gallinula.—Front red; bracelets many; body Porphyrio green; violet beneath. Fifteen inches long. Common in most temperate and warm countries. Is docile and easily tamed. Stands on one leg, and lifts the food to its mouth with the other. Feeds on fish, roots, fruits, and seeds.\n\nB. Feet pinnated. Coot.\n\nCommon, black, or bald coot.—Front flesh-coloured; bracelets greenish-yellow; body blackish; bill yellowish-white; front, except in pairing time, white; legs yel-CCGXCIX: lowish-green; outer edge of the wings white. There are several varieties. Length 18 inches; weight from 20 to 30 ounces. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. It occurs in Great Britain at all seasons of the year, and is not supposed to migrate to other countries, but changes its stations, and to remove from the pools, where the young have been reared to the larger lakes, where flocks assemble in the winter. The female commonly builds her nest of a great quantity of coarse dried weeds, well matted together, and lined within with softer and finer grasses, in a bush of rushes surrounded by the water. She lays from 12 to 15 eggs at a time, and commonly hatches twice in a season. Her eggs are about the size of those of a pullet, and of a pale brownish-white colour, sprinkled with numerous small dark spots, which, at the thicker end, seem as if they had run into each other, and formed bigger blotches. As soon as the young quit the shell, they plunge into the water, dive, and swim about with great ease, but they still gather about the mother, and take shelter under her wings, and do not entirely leave her for some time. They are first covered with a footy-coloured down, and are of a shapeless appearance; and, while in this state, before they have learned by experience to shun their enemies, they are often sacrificed to the rapacity of the pike, the kite, moor-hawk, &c. A female of this species built her nest in Sir William Middleton's lake at Bellay, in Northumberland, among the rushes, which were afterwards loosed by the wind, so that the nest was driven about, and floated on the surface of the water; notwithstanding which, she continued to sit as usual, and brought out her young on her moveable habitation. The common coot swims and dives with great ease, but is a bad traveller, and may be said not to walk, but to splash and waddle between one pool and another, with a laboured, ill-balanced, and awkward gait. During the day it usually skulks among the rushes or other water plants, rarely venturing abroad, except in the dusk, or at night, in quest of herbage, seeds, insects, and fishes. The sportsman and his dog can seldom force it to spring from its retreat, as it will rather bury itself in the mud than take wing, or,\nif it be very closely pursued, and compelled to rise, it gets up with much flustering and apparent difficulty.\n\nGreater coot.—Front white; bracelets red; body blackish. Has much the appearance and manners of the last, but is larger and blacker. It is found both in England and Scotland. The French eat it on meagre days.\n\nCrested coot.—Blue black; naked front and crown red; caruncle red; bill; erect; bracelets red, green, and yellow; bill whitish, with a red base; legs dusky. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits China and Madagascar.\n\nGen. 61. VAGINALIS, Sheath-bill.\n\nBill strong, thick, conical, convex, and compressed; upper mandible covered above with a moveable horny sheath; nostrils small, placed before the sheath; tongue round above, flattened beneath, and pointed at the tip; face naked and papillose; wings with an obtuse excrescence under the flexure; legs strong; four toes; naked a little above the knees; toes rough beneath; claws grooved.\n\nWhite sheath-bill.—Bill black at the base; sheath a horny-yellow or black plate, nearly covering the nostrils; face naked; and in the adult bird, befit with white, or pale orange warts; a brown or blackish wart above the eyes, larger than the rest; feathers white; excrescence on the wings blackish; legs two inches long, and generally reddish. The only species of the genus; about the size of a pigeon. From 15 to 18 inches long; inhabits New Zealand and the South seas, and feeds on shell-fish and carcasses.\n\nGen. 62. PARRA, Jacana.\n\nBill tapering, somewhat obtuse; nostrils oval, in the middle of the bill; front covered with lobated caruncles; wings spinous.\n\nChilean jacana.—Claws moderate; legs brown; hind-head subcrested. Inhabits Chili. Size of a jay, but has longer legs; feeds on worms and insects; is noisy, and defends itself by the spurs on the wings. Builds in the grass, and lays four tawny eggs, speckled with black.\n\nCheesnut jacana.—Hind claws very long; legs greenish. Ten inches long; inhabits watery places in South America, and utters almost uneasily, a shrill disagreeable cry.\n\nFaithful jacana.—Toes long; legs tawny; hind head crested; bill dirty white; upper mandible like that of the dunghill cock; a red membrane on both sides at the base of the bill extending to the temples, in the middle of which are the eyes; irides brown; hind head with about 12 blackish feathers; three inches long, forming a pendent crest; rest of the neck covered with thick black down; body brown; wings and tail blackish; wing-spurs two or three, and half an inch long; belly light black; thighs half bare; toes so long as to entangle each other in walking. About the size of a cock, and stands a foot and a half from the ground. Inhabits the rivers and inundated places near Carthage, in America; feeds on herbs; has a clear and loud voice, a slow gait, and easy flight. The natives keep one of these birds tame to wander with the poultry, and defend them against birds of prey, which it does by means of the spurs on its wings. It never defects the charge committed to its care, and brings them home at night. It will readily fulfill itself to be handled by grown up persons, but not by children.\n\nGen. 63. RALLUS, Rail.\n\nBill thickish at the base; attenuated on the back towards the tip; compressed; a little incurved and pointed; tongue rough at the tip; body compressed; tail short; feet four-toed and cleft.\n\nThe birds of this genus have the bill a little inflected; small nostrils; tongue rough; and the tail very short.\n\nLand rail, crake, corn crake, daker hen, &c.—Wings reddish-brown; bill and legs brownish; irides hazel; feathers of the body reddish-brown; the upper ones black in the middle; chin very pale; belly whitish-yellow. About nine inches and a half long. Inhabits the fedge parts of Europe and Asia. From its appearing at the same time with the quail, and frequenting the same places, it is sometimes called king of the quails. Its well-known cry is first heard as soon as the grass becomes long enough to shelter it, and continues till the grass is cut; but the bird is seldom seen, as it skulks in the thickest parts of the herbage, and runs so nimbly through it, winding and doubling in every direction, that it is difficult to come near it. When hard pushed by the dog, it sometimes stops short and squats down, by which means its too eager pursuer overhoots the spot, and loses the trace. It seldom springs but when driven to extremity, and generally flies with its legs hanging down, but never to a great distance. As soon as it alights, it runs off, and before the fowler has reached the spot, the bird is at a considerable distance. It is a migrative species, appearing with us about the latter end of April, and departing in October. On its first appearance, and till the female begins to fit, the male is frequently heard to make a singular kind of noise, much resembling that of a comb when the finger is drawn along the teeth of it, and which has been used as a decoy. When they first arrive, they are very lean, but before their departure, become excessively fat, and are much sought after for the delicacy of their flesh.\n\nWater rail, brook ouzel, bitcock, velvet runner, &c.—Aquaticus. Wings gray, spotted with brown; flanks spotted with white; bill orange beneath; bill black, reddish at the base; irides red; feathers of the upper part of the body olive-brown, and black in the middle; the lower ones cinereous; those of the lower part of the belly and vent edged with rufous; quill feathers dusky; lower tail-coverts white; tail feathers short, black; the two middle ones at the tip, the rest edged with ferruginous; legs dusky-red. Length about 12 inches; weight four ounces. Inhabits watery places in Europe and Asia. Though not very plentiful, it is sometimes found in various parts of Great Britain, in low situations, about water courses and rivulets, where it seeks shelter among fedge-ruthes and reeds, and is seldom put to flight, depending chiefly on its legs for safety. When roused, it flies only a small distance, and that in a heavy and awkward manner, with its legs hanging down. It runs nimbly, and frequently flirts up its tail. The nest is made\nmade of fedge and coarse grass among the thickest aquatic plants, or in willow beds. The female lays five or more eggs, rather larger than those of a blackbird, very smooth, and of a pure white. This bird continues with us all the year, and by many is erroneously believed to be the land rail metamorphosed in the autumn, without knowing perhaps that the latter leaves this country at that season, and that the difference of the bills alone constitutes an essential distinction.\n\nSpotted gallinule, or spotted water-hen.—Two middle tail feathers edged with white; bill and legs pale olive; bill greenish-yellow; irides hazel; head brown, spotted with black; line over the eyes pale gray; neck above, and flanks brown-ash, with small white spots; back and wing-coverts olive with black stripes, and near the edges of the feathers with white spots; the greater with white stripes and lines; cheeks, chin, and throat pale gray, with brown spots; breast brown, with white spots; belly varied with cinereous and white; vent ochre-yellow. The weight of this elegant species is about four ounces; length nine inches. Inhabits Europe and North America; is migrative and scarce in England, and seems to have the manners and habits of the preceding.\n\nBlack rail.—Black; bill red at the base, brown at the tip; legs brown, or red. Nine inches long. Inhabits Africa.\n\nDwarf rail.—Striped with ferruginous and black; body black beneath, with narrow white bands; throat and breast buffish. Size of a lark. Inhabits near the salt lakes of Dunria.\n\nGen. 64. Psophia, Trumpeter.\n\nCharacters. Bill cylindrical, conical, convex, somewhat pointed; the upper mandible longest; nostrils oval and pervious; tongue cartilaginous, flat, and fringed at the tip; feet four-toed and cleft.\n\nGold-breasted trumpeter. Black; back gray; breast glossy-green; orbits naked, red; bill yellowish-green; legs strong, tall, brownish ash or green; the back to a round protuberance beneath, at a little distance from the ground; tail very short; feathers of the head downy; of the lower part of the neck squamiform; of the shoulders ferruginous, lax, pendulous, and silky; scapulars long and hanging. The agami of voyagers and others. Nearly 22 inches long, and about the size of the common domestic fowl. Inhabits South America, particularly the interior of Guiana in considerable troops. In its native haunts is not distrustful of man, and is susceptible of domestication in an eminent degree, acquiring many of the social habits of the dog. It emits from the lungs a harsh and uncommon noise, not unlike that of a child's trumpet. It stands on one leg, and sleeps with its neck drawn in between the shoulders.\n\nUndulated or African trumpeter.—Crest of the hind head short, whitish; that of the breast long, black, and pendent. Size of a goose. Inhabits Africa.\n\nORDER V. GALLINÆ.\n\nBill convex; the upper mandible arched and dilated at the edge over the lower; nostrils half covered with a convex cartilaginous membrane; tail feathers more than 12; feet cleft, but connected at the innermost joint; claws broad; toes scabrous below, and formed for scratching up the ground. In most species the males have spurs on the legs. They live chiefly on the seeds of plants, but likewise eat insects, grubs, and worms, which are macerated in their crop. They are polygamous, and build rude nests, for the most part on the bare ground, the female laying many eggs at a time. They collect their young about them by a particular cry when they feed them, and lead and protect them till they moult. They are easily tamed, and are useful on account of their flesh, their eggs, and their feathers.\n\nGen. 65. Otis, Bustard.\n\nBill somewhat convex; nostrils oval and pervious; tongue bifid, pointed; feet formed for running; three-toed; tall; naked above the thighs.\n\nGreat bustard.—Wave spotted, with black and rufous; whitish beneath; head, (of the male) and each side of the throat crested; head and neck cinereous; quill feathers black; tail with rufous and black lines, and from 18 to 20 feathers; pouch beginning under the tongue, and reaching to the breast; long, capacious, and fit to hold near seven quarts of water; legs dusky. The male weighs from 20 to 30 pounds, and the female about 10 or 12; length about four feet. Inhabits the open plains of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is the largest of British birds, and is now almost extinct in our island. It makes no nest, but the female lays her eggs in some hole in the ground, in a dry corn field. The eggs are two in number as big as those of a goose, and of a pale olive-brown marked with spots of a deeper colour. If during her absence from the nest, any one handles, or even breathes on the eggs, she immediately abandons them. Bustards feed on green corn, the tops of turnips, and various other vegetables, as well as on worms; and they have also been known to eat frogs, mice, and young birds of the smaller kind, which they swallow whole. They are remarkably shy and timid, carefully avoiding mankind, and being easily driven away in whole herds by the smallest dog. They are slow in taking wing, but run with great rapidity; and the young are even sometimes couried and taken by greyhounds. Though not properly migratory, they leave their usual haunts in very severe winters, when the downs are covered for any length of time with snow, and repair to the more inclosed and sheltered situations, in small flocks, and even stray to a great distance. In the Crimea they are seen in large flights, especially during winter, when the wings and crop feathers are sometimes so encumbered with ice, that the bird is unable, in the snow, to take the run previous to flying, in consequence of which many are caught by the hand, or by means of dogs, and brought to market alive. The flesh, particularly of the young, when kept a little time, is excellent.\n\nArabian bustard.—Ears with erect crests. Size of the preceding. Inhabits Asia and Africa.\n\nLittle bustard, or field duck.—Head and throat smooth; bill gray-brown; crown black, with rufous bands; temples and chin reddish-white, with small dark spots; neck (of the male) black, with a white collar; body above varied with black, rufous, and white; beneath\nand outer edge of the wings white. About the size of a pheasant; length 17 inches. Inhabits Southern Europe and Asia. A few instances are on record of its having been found in England. In France, it is frequently served at table as a delicacy, though the flesh be blackish. In June it lays from three to five eggs, of a glossy green, and the young are able to fly in August.\n\nWhite-eared bustard.—Black; back cinereous; ears white; in the male the bill and legs are yellow; the crown is cinereous, and the wings are marked with a large white blotch; the neck behind, and thighs above the knees, have a white collar; the tail feathers 14; the female is cinereous, and the thighs and belly black. Length 22 inches. Native of the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nRuffed bustard.—Yellowish, spotted with brown; feathers of the neck long, whitish, with black shafts; quill feathers black, with a white spot in the middle. Size of a capon. Inhabits Africa and Arabia.\n\nThick-kneed bustard, stone curlew, or Norfolk plover.—Gray; two first quill feathers black, white in the middle; bill sharp pointed; legs cinereous; bill black; legs greenish-yellow; lower eyelid naked, pale yellow; a yellow line above and beneath the eyes; a brown line from the bill, under the eyes to the ears; knees thick, as if swollen; belly and thighs white. Weight about 17 ounces; length 18 inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. With us it is a migrative species, making its first appearance the latter end of April, or beginning of May, when the male is heard to make a very loud shrill noise, particularly in the dusk of the evening. It chiefly frequents large corn fields, heaths, or warrens, in open hilly situations; makes no nest, but lays two light-brown coloured eggs, blotched and streaked with dusky, on the ground. Its food chiefly consists of insects and worms, and sometimes also of mice, frogs, and toads. In the autumn, these birds assemble in small flocks preparatory to their departure, and are seldom seen after the beginning of October. When flying, they stretch out their feet straight behind, like the heron. The young are hardly to be distinguished from the stones in which they generally harbour.\n\nGen. 66. Struthio.\n\nBill subconical; nostrils oval; wings short, unfit for flight; feet formed for running.\n\nBlack ostrich.—Feet with two toes; head small; bill horn-colour; irides hazel; eyelids fringed, head and greater part of the neck bald, flesh-coloured, with a few scattered hairs; feathers of the body lax, black, and decomposite; the webs on each side equal; quill and tail feathers snowy, waved, and long, with a sprinkling of black on the edge or tip; chest callous; wing spurs two, one at the end of the wing, and one on the spurious wing; thighs and flanks naked; feet strong, gray-brown; toes connected at the base, the outer very short, and unarmed. The ostrich stands so very high as to measure from seven to nine feet, from the top of the head to the ground; from the back, however, it is seldom more than three or four feet, the rest of its height being made up by its extremely long neck. In the sandy and burning deserts of Africa and Asia, the black ostriches are seen in such large flocks, as sometimes to have been mistaken for distant cavalry. Their strong jointed legs, and cloven hoofs, if we may use the expression, are well adapted both for speed and defence. Their wings and all their feathers are insufficient to raise them from the ground. Their voice is a kind of hollow mournful lowing; and they graze on the plain with the quagga and the zebra. In the interior parts of southern Africa they frequently make great havoc in the corn fields, destroying the ears of wheat so effectually, that in a large tract of land, it often happens that nothing but the bare straw is left behind. In running, they have a proud and haughty look, and even when closely pursued, never appear to be in great haste, especially when the wind is with them, and they can easily accelerate their progress by flapping their wings, so as to outstrip the swiftest horse. But if the weather be hot and calm, or if the birds have by any accident lost a wing, the difficulty of outrunning them is not of great. The ostrich is one of the few polygamous birds found in a state of nature, one male being generally seen with two or three, and frequently with five females. It has been commonly believed that the female, after depositing her eggs in the sand, and covering them up, allows them to be hatched by the heat of the climate, and leaves the young to shift for themselves. Recent travellers have, however, assured us, that no bird whatever has a stronger affection for her offspring, and that none watches her eggs with greater fidelity. It is true, that during the intense heat of the day, when incubation is less necessary, she sometimes forsakes them, but she always carefully broods over them by night. Kolben affirms that this species fit on their eggs like other birds, and that the males and females take this office by turns, as he had frequent opportunities of observing. Nor is it more true, that they forsake their young as soon as excluded from the shell. On the contrary, the old ones are very industrious in supplying them with grass and water, are careful to defend them from harm, and will even themselves encounter every danger in their defence. All the females which are attached to one male, deposit their eggs in the same place, to the number of ten or twelve each, about the size of a child's head. These they hatch all together, the male also taking his turn of sitting on them. Thus from sixty to seventy eggs have sometimes been found in one nest, and Linnæus erroneously assigned them to one female. The term of incubation is six weeks. The nest appears to be merely a hole in the ground, formed by the birds trampling the earth for some time with their feet. If the eggs are touched by any person in the absence of the parents, they immediately discover it by the scent, at their return, and not only desert from laying any more in the same place, but trample to pieces with their feet all those that have been left. On this account the Africans are very careful in taking part of the eggs away not to touch any of them with their hands, but always fetch them out of the nest with a long stick. Within the eggs are frequently discovered a number of small oval-shaped pebbles, of the size of a marrow-fat pea, of a pale yellow colour, and exceedingly hard. These eggs are reckoned a great delicacy, and are prepared in various ways. From their large size, one of them is sufficient to serve two or three persons at a meal. The ostrich itself is chiefly valuable for its plumage; and the Arabs have reduced the chase of it to a kind of science. They hunt\nit, we are told, on horseback, and begin their pursuit at a gentle gallop; for should they, at the outset, use the least rashness, the matchless speed of the game would immediately carry it out of their sight, and in a very short time, beyond their reach. But when they proceed gradually, it makes no particular effort to escape. As it does not go in a direct line, but runs first on one side, and then on the other, its pursuers save much ground by rushing directly onward. In a few days at most, the strength of the animal is exhausted, and it then either turns on the hunters, and fights with the fury of despair, or hides its head, and tamely receives its fate. Frequently, also, the natives conceal themselves in ostrich skins, and thus are enabled to approach near enough to surprise them. Some persons breed up these birds in flocks, for they are tamed with very little trouble, and may be rendered very useful in a domestic state. Besides the valuable feathers which they cast, the eggs which they lay, their skins, which are used by the Arabians as a substitute for leather, and their flesh, which many esteem excellent food, they are sometimes made to serve in place of horses. It is pleasant to observe with what dexterity they play and frolic about in a tame state, particularly in the heat of the day, when they will strut along the sunny side of a house, with great majesty, perpetually fanning themselves with their expanded wings, and seeming, at every turn, to admire and be enamoured of their own shadows. They are very tractable and familiar towards persons who are acquainted with them, but are often fierce towards strangers, whom they frequently attempt to push down by running furiously on them, and when they succeed thus far, they not only peck at their fallen foe with their bill, but strike at him violently with their feet. While thus engaged, they sometimes make a fierce hissing noise, and have their throat inflated, and mouth open; and at other times, make a kind of cackling noise. During the night they often utter a doleful or hideous cry, somewhat resembling the distant roaring of a lion, or the hoarse tone of a bear or an ox, as if they were in great agony. They will swallow with the utmost voracity rags, leather, wood, iron, or stone, indiscriminately. \"I saw one at Oran (says Dr Shaw), that swallowed, without any seeming uneasiness or inconvenience, several leaden bullets, as they were thrown upon the floor, scorching hot from the mould.\" Mr Adanson mentions two ostriches which afforded him a fight of a very extraordinary nature. They were so tame, that two little blacks mounted both together on the back of the largest. No sooner did he feel their weight, than he began to run as fast as possible, and carried them several times round the village, as it was impossible to stop him otherwise than by obstructing the passage. To try their strength, he directed a full-grown negro to mount the smallest, and two others the largest. This burden did not seem at all disproportionate to their strength. At first they went at a pretty sharp trot, but when they became heated a little, they expanded their wings, as if to catch the wind, and moved with such fleetness that they scarcely seemed to touch the ground. \"Most people (observes M. Adanson) have, one time or other, seen a partridge run, and consequently must know that there is no man whatever able to keep up with it: and it is easy to imagine, that if this bird had a longer step, its speed would be considerably augmented. The ostrich moves like the partridge, with this advantage; and I am satisfied that those I am speaking of would have distanced the fleetest race-horses that were ever bred in England. It is true, they would not hold out so long as a horse, but they would undoubtedly be able to go over the space in less time. I have frequently beheld this flight, which is capable of giving one an idea of the prodigious strength of an ostrich, and of shewing what use it might be of, had we but the method of breaking and managing it as we do a horse.\"\n\nEmu or cassowary.—Feet three-toed; helmet and Cassarius, dewlaps naked; bill and legs black; gape very large; irises topaz; eyelids fringed; nostrils nearly at the tip of the bill; eyes large; helmet horny, reaching from the base of the bill to the middle of the crown, three inches high, the fore part blackish, the hind part yellow; temples and neck bald, wrinkled, and reddish, with a blue or purple tinge, and covered with a few scattered hairs; two pendent caruncles, partly red and partly blue one each side of the neck; chest on which it refts callous; feathers brownish-black, lax, generally two from one shaft; no tail; wings consisting of about five naked fulvy shafts; claws straight. Five feet and a half long. Inhabits within the torrid zone in Asia; is a fierce and bold bird; kicks with its feet like a horse, grunts like a hog, feeds on vegetables, which it swallows whole; lays greenish eggs, more oblong than those of the black ostrich; runs very swiftly, and is incapable of flying.\n\nNew Holland cassowary.—Feet three-toed; crown New Holland flat; flanks serrated behind. Seven feet two inches long. Inhabits New Holland.\n\nAmerican ostrich.—Feet three-toed, and a round cal- Rheas behind. Nearly the height of a man. Inhabits South America; feeds on fruits, flesh, and flies, defends itself with its feet, and calls its young by a kind of hiss.\n\nGen. 67. Didus, Dodo.\n\nBill narrowed in the middle, with two transverse Characters, wrinkles; each mandible bent in at the tip; nostrils oblique, near the edge of the middle of the bill; face naked beyond the eyes; legs short and thick; feet cleft; wings unfit for flight; no tail.\n\nHooded dodo.—Black, waved with whitish; head Ineptus, hooded; feet four-toed; bill strong, large, bluish, with a red spot; the upper mandible yellowish at the tip, the lower bulging near the tip; gape very large; irises whitish; plumage soft; belly whitish; head large, black, as if covered with a cap; feathers of the rump curled, inclining to yellow; legs yellowish; claws wanting. This uncouth species is rather bigger than a swan, and nearly three feet in length. It inhabits the islands of Mauritius and Bourbon in the Indian ocean. According to Herbert, it seldom weighs less than 50 pounds; has a slow pace; the body round and fat; and the stomach so strong as to digest stones. It is, however, seldom met with that its true history is little known.\n\nSolitary dodo.—Varied with gray and brown; feet Solitarius, four-toed; eyes black; spurious wings, terminating in a round protuberance. The female with a white protuberance, resembling a teat on each side of the breast. Size of a turkey. Inhabits the island of Rodrigue, where it is not uncommon, though seldom more than two\ntwo are found together. It makes its nest in by-places, of leaves of the palm, a foot and a half in thickness, and lays one egg, bigger than that of a goose. The male fits in his turn, and does not suffer any bird to approach within two hundred yards of the spot when the hen is fitting. The incubation lasts seven weeks. Some months elapse before the young can shift for itself. The old ones in the mean time treat it with affection and tenderness, and are faithful to each other afterwards, though they may occasionally mix with others of their kind. The young bird, though timid, is stupid enough to allow a person to approach it; but when grown up, it is more shy, and will not be tamed. They are chased in the winter season, viz. from March to September, being then fat, and the young birds are much esteemed for the table.\n\nGen. 68. Pavo, Peacock.\n\nBill convex and strong; head with a crest of feathers turning forwards; nostrils large; rump feathers long, broad, expanse, and covered with eye-like spots.\n\nCrested peacock.—Head with a compressed crest; spurs solitary. It is impossible to describe the beauties of this well-known species in adequate terms. Its matchless plumage, as Buffon observes, seems to combine all that delights the eye in the soft and delicate tints of the finest flowers, all that dazzles it in the sparkling lustre of the gems, and all that astonishes it in the grand display of the rainbow. Its head is adorned with a tuft, consisting of 24 feathers, whose slender shafts are furnished with webs only at the ends, painted with the most exquisite green, mixed with gold. The head, throat, neck, and breast, are of a deep blue, glopped with green and gold; the back of the same, tinged with bronze; the scapulars and lesser wing-coverts are of a reddish cream-colour, variegated with black; the middle coverts deep blue, glopped with green and gold; the greater coverts and purplish wing are of a reddish-brown, as are also the quills, some of which are variegated with black and green; the belly and vent are black, with a greenish line. But the distinguishing character of this bird is its train, which rises just above the tail, and when erected, forms a fan of the most resplendent hues. The two middle feathers are sometimes four feet and a half long, the others gradually diminishing on each side. The shafts, which are white, are furnished from their origin nearly to the end with parted filaments of varying colours, ending in a flat valve, which is decorated with what is called the eye. This is a brilliant spot, enamelled with the most enchanting colours, yellow, gilded with various shades, green, running into blue and bright violet, varying according to its different positions, the whole receiving additional lustre from the centre, which is a fine velvet black. When pleased or delighted, and in sight of his females, the peacock erects his tail, and displays all the majesty of his beauty, and he frequently turns slowly round, as if to catch the sunbeams in every direction, accompanied with a hollow murmuring voice. His cry at other times is very disagreeable, and often repeated. The peahen is somewhat less than the cock, and though furnished both with a train and crest, is destitute of those dazzling beauties which distinguish the male. She lays five or six eggs of a whitish colour, in some secret spot, where she can conceal them from the male, who is apt to break them; and she sits from 25 to 30 days, according to the temperature of the climate and the warmth of the season. Peacocks were originally brought from the distant provinces of India, and thence have been diffused over every part of the world. They are sometimes found in a wild state in many parts of Asia and Africa. The largest and finest are said to be met with in the neighbourhood of the Ganges, and on the fertile plains of India, where they grow to a great size. In colder climates, they require care in rearing; and do not acquire their full plumage till their third year. In former times they were considered as a delicacy, and made a part of the luxurious entertainment of the Roman voluptuaries. The females of this species, like the pheasant, have been known to assume the appearance of the male, by a total change of colour, which is said to take place after they have done laying. A white variety of peacock occurs not unfrequently, in which the eyes of the train are barely visible, and may be traced by a different undulation of shade on the pure white of the tail.\n\nIris peacock.—Brown; head subcrested; spurs two; bill blackish; the upper mandible, from the nostrils to the tip, red; irides yellow; crown black; face naked; temples white; neck thinning-brown, with black lines; upper part of the back, shoulders, and wing-coverts brown, with yellowish stripes; the feathers near the tip with a large purple gold spot; lower part of the back and rump spotted with white; body brown beneath, with transverse black streaks; quill feathers dusky; legs brown. Larger than a pheasant. Inhabits China.\n\nGen. 69. Meleagris, Turkey.\n\nBill conical, and incurved; head covered with spongy caruncles; chin with a longitudinal membranaceous caruncle; tail broad, and expanse; legs spurred.\n\nAmerican, or common turkey.—Front and chin carunculated; breast of the male tufted. Female without a spur. Upwards of three feet and half long. Inhabits America; and is very generally domesticated. In a wild state it lives in woods, and feeds on nuts, acorns, and insects. It roosts on the highest trees; is very irritable, and impatient of anything red. The cock utters with an inflated breast, expanded tail, red face, and relaxed frontal caruncle, making a singular inward noise, which, when it is uttered, shakes the whole body. The eggs are numerous and white, with reddish or yellow spots. The females lay them in spring, generally in some retired and obscure place; for the cock, enraged at the loss of his mate while she is employed in hatching, is otherwise apt to break them. They fit on their eggs with so much perseverance, that if not taken away, they will almost perish with hunger before they will entirely leave the nest. In a wild state, turkeys are gregarious, and associate in flocks, sometimes of about five hundred. They are very swift runners, but fly awkwardly; and about the month of March, they become too fat, that they cannot fly beyond three or four hundred yards, and are then easily run down by a horseman. The hunting of these birds forms one of the principal diversions of the Canadians. When the latter have discovered the retreats of the turkeys, which in general are near fields of nettles, or where there is plenty of any kind of grain, they send a well-trained dog into the midst of the flock.\nThe birds no sooner perceive their enemy than they run off at full speed, and with such swiftness that they leave the dog far behind; he, however, follows, and as they cannot go at this rate for any length of time, at last forces them to take shelter in a tree, where they fit, spent and fatigued, till the hunters come up, and with long poles, knock them down one after another. Turkey cocks, among themselves, are very fierce and pugnacious, and yet, against other animals, are usually weak and cowardly. The disposition of the female is in general much more mild and gentle than that of the male; and when leading out her young family to collect their food, though so large and apparently so powerful a bird, she gives them very little protection against any rapacious animal that comes in her way, but rather warns them to shift for themselves. It deserves to be remarked, that though this species is reared with some difficulty, yet in its wild state it is found in great plenty in the forests of Canada, that are covered with snow for more than three-fourths of the year. It is easily hurt by hunger or rain. They are bred in great numbers in Norfolk, Suffolk, and some other counties, from whence they are driven to the London markets in flocks of several hundreds. The drivers manage them with great facility, by means of a bit of red rag tied to the end of a long stick, which, from the antipathy that these birds bear to that colour, effectually answers the purposes of a scourge. We need scarcely notice, that the flesh of the turkey is reckoned a delicate food. The Indians make an elegant clothing of the feathers, by twisting the inner webs into a strong double string with hemp, or the inner bark of the mulberry-tree, and working it like matting, so that the whole appears rich and glossy, and as fine as silk flax. The natives of Louisiana make fans of the tail; and of four tails joined together the French used formerly to form a parasol.\n\n**Horned turkey.**—Head with two horns; body red, with eye-like spots; bill brown; nostrils, front, and area of the eyes covered with black hair-like feathers; crown red; horns callous, blue, bent back; caruncle of the chin dilatable, blue, varied with rufous; legs whitish; spurred; tail feathers twenty. The female has the head covered with feathers, without horns or gular caruncle; feathers of the head and upper part of the neck black-blue, long, and decumbent; rest of the body, as in the male, red with eye-like spots; spurs more obtuse. Rather less than the preceding. Inhabits India.\n\n**Gen. 70. Penelope.**\n\nBill naked at the base; head covered with feathers; chin naked; tail with twelve feathers; legs without spurs.\n\n**Guan.**—Head with an erect crest; temples violet. Two feet six inches long. Inhabits Brazil and Guiana, where it is frequently tamed, its flesh being reckoned very delicate. It frequently utters a sound like the word jacu.\n\n**Jacu or yacou.**—Blackish; crest and first quill feathers white. Size of a hen turkey. Inhabits Cayenne and Guiana. It erects its crest, expands its tail, and cries in a mournful tone, like a young turkey. It builds on the ground, is easily tamed, and is often domesticated.\n\n**Marail turkey.**—Greenish-black; naked orbits; and legs red; throat somewhat naked, speckled with white.\n\nSize of a common fowl, and not dissimilar in shape. Though not much known to naturalists, it is common in the woods of Guiana, at a distance from the sea. It is generally seen in small flocks, excepting at breeding-time, when it is only met with in pairs, and then frequently on the ground, or on low shrubs, at other times on high trees, on which it roosts during the night. The female makes her nest on some low bushy tree, as near the trunk as possible, and lays three or four eggs. When the young have been hatched for ten or twelve days, they descend with the mother, which scratches on the ground like a hen, and broods them, till they can shift for themselves. They breed twice a-year. The young birds are easily tamed, and seldom forsake the places where they have been brought up. Their cry is not unharmonious, unless they be irritated or wounded, when it is harsh and loud. Their flesh is much esteemed.\n\n**Gen. 71. Crax, Curassow.**\n\nBill strong and thick; the base of each mandible covered with a cere; nostrils in the middle of the cere; feathers covering the head turned spirally forward; tail large, straight, and expandible.\n\n**Crested curassow.**—(Male). Cere yellow; body Aleutian black; belly white; bill black or horny; cere reaching from the middle of the bill behind the eyes; crest erect, black, and three inches long; tail black and roundish, eleven inches long, feathers fourteen; spurs none. (Female.) Red; head bluish; crest white, tipped with black; bill cinereous; irides red; legs brown. Subject to much variety. Three feet long. Inhabits the mountainous woods of South America. Lives on fruits, roots or trees, and is often domesticated on account of its white and delicate flesh. They are frequently kept tame in our menageries, and readily mix with other poultry, feeding on bread and grain, but they are unable to bear the dampness of the grass of our meadows, which renders their toes subject to rot off. Dr Latham mentions an instance in which the whole of one foot was gone, and but part of one toe left on the other, before the creature died.\n\n**Globicurassow, or curassow bird.**—Yellow; gibbosity globicera of the nostrils globular; body blackish-blue, lower part of the belly white; bill yellow, tipped with cinereous; gibbosity yellow, and very hard; irides red; orbits white; crest black, tipped with white; legs pale rusty. (Female.) Bill and legs cinereous; head and crown black; crest black, with a white band; some of the feathers of the neck tipped with white; throat, breast, back, and wings brown; upper part of the belly white, and some of the feathers tipped with black; vent yellowish-brown; tail black, with four transverse white bands. Size of the preceding. Inhabits Guiana.\n\n**Gen. 72. Phasianus, Pheasant.**\n\nBill short and strong; cheeks covered with a smooth naked skin; legs generally with spurs.\n\nThe females produce many young ones at a brood, and take care of them for some time, leading them abroad, and pointing out food for them. The young are at first clad with a thick soft down. The nests of the whole tribe are formed on the ground.\nCommon cock, or wild cock.—Comb on the crown, and two wattles on the chin comprifhed; ears naked; tail comprifhed and crested; feathers of the neck linear, long, and membranaceous at the tips; body, when wild, lefs than the common cock; comb large, indented, thinning-red; temples and line from the creft to the eyes naked and fhef-coloured, a clay-coloured spot of the shape of a man's nail, and covered with fhort feathers behind the eyes; feathers of the reft of the head and neck long, narrow, gray at the bafe, black in the middle, and tipt with white; feathers of the upper part of the body grayifh, with a white and a black fleck; breast red-dift; greater wing-coverts reddifh-chefnut, with tranfverfe black and white fleaks; tail coverts glafly-violet; middle tail feathers long and falcated; fpurs large and curved. The female without comb and wattles; head and neck gray; cheeks and chin whitish; body more dufky, and varied with brown, gray, and rufous; and wants the fpurs. Inhabits India in a wild ftate, is every where dometifed, and fubject to innumerable varieties in size and colour. His beaufiful plumage and undaunted spirit, as well as his great utility, have rendered him a favourite in all countries into which he has been introduced. The cock is very attentive to his females, hardly ever lofing fight of them. He leads, defends, and cherifhes them, collefts them together when they ftraggle, and feems to eat unwillingly till he fees them feeding around him. Whenever a strange cock appears within his domain, he immediately attacks the intruder, and if poffible, drives him away. The patience and perfeverance of the hen in the hatching, are truly extraordinary, but are too familiar to moft of our readers to require to be detailed. Though by nature timid, and apt to fly from the meaneft affaultant, yet, when marching at the head of her brood, she is fearless of danger, and will fly in the face of the fiercet animal that offers to annoy her. As the chickens reared by the hen bear no proportion to the number of eggs which he produces, many artificial schemes of rearing have been attempted. Chickens have long been hatched in Egypt by means of artificial heat. This is now chiefly practifed by the inhabitants of a village called Berne, and by thofe who live at a little diftance from it. Towards the beginning of autumn, thefe perfons spread themfelves all over the country, and each of them is ready to undertake the management of an oven. Thefe ovens are of different fizes, each capable of containing from forty to eighty thoufand eggs; and the number of ovens in different parts is about three hundred and eighty-fix. They are usually kept in exercife for about fix months; and as each brood takes up twenty-one days in hatching, it is eafy in every one of them to produce eight different broods of chickens in the year. The ovens confift only of a low arched apartment of clay. Two rows of shelves are formed; and the eggs are placed on them in fuch a manner as not to touch each other. They are flightly moved five or fix times in the courfe of twenty-four hours. All poffible care is taken to diffufe the heat equally throughout, and there is but one aperture, juft large enough to admit a man flopping. During the firft eight days, the heat is rendered great, but during the laft eight it is gradually diminifhed, till at length, when the young brood are ready to come forth, it is reduced almost to the ftate of the natural atmosphere. Every keeper of an oven obliges himfelf to deliver to his employer only two thirds of as many chickens as there have been eggs entrufied to him; and he is a gainer by this bargain, as it always happens, except from fome unlucky accident, that many more than that proportion of the eggs are productive. In this way it has been calculated that the Egyptian ovens give life annually to near a hundred millions of chickens. This ufeful and advantageous mode of hatching eggs was introduced into France by the ingenious and indefatigable Monfieur de Reaumur, who, by a number of experiments, reduced the art to certain principles, and applied it to the production of all kinds of dometifc fowls. The young brood are generally hatched a whole day before they take food, and then a few crumbs of bread are given for a day or two, after which time they begin to pick up grain and infeds for themfelves. In order to fave the trouble of attending them, capons are taught to watch them in the fame manner as hens. M. de Reaumur informs us, that he has feen above two hundred chickens at once, all led about and defended by only three or four capons. It is afiered that even cocks may be taught to perform this office, which they will continue to do all their lives afterwards. Among the endles varieties of this fpecies, the Englifh game cock stands unrivalled by thofe of any other nation for its invincible courage, and on that account is made ufe of as the instrument of the inhuman fport of cock-fighting. The Athenians allotted one day in the year to this barbarous paffion; and the Romans are faid to have learned it from them, and to have introduced it into this ifland. Henry VIII. was fo fond of the fport, that he caufed a commodious houfe to be erected for that purpofe, which, though now applied to a very different ufe, still retains the name of the cock-pit. The Chinefe, the Sumatrins, and others in the eaftern parts of the world, are fo addicted to this favage divertion, that, in the paroxyfms of their phreny, they will fometimes rifk not only the whole of their property, but their wives and children on the ifide of a battle. The cock, it is well known, is a watchful bird, and crows clapping his wings. The hen will lay eggs the whole year, provided she has plenty of food and cold water, gravel, and a warm place. After laying she has a peculiar note of triumph and exultation. Her heat is increafed while hatching, but if put into cold water, she ceafes to fit.\n\nCourier pheafant.—Rufous, head blue; tail wedged; cheeks papilous; bill pale, horn colour; irides yellow; cheeks red, fpockled with black; in the old birds wrinkled and pendulous; a greenifh-black feathered line from the noftrils to beneath the eyes; reft of the head and neck green-gold, with a glofs of violet and blue; lower part of the neck, breast, back, and rump, flining tawny; quill feathers brown, with ochrous fpots; belly and vent white; tail feathers eighteen, with tranfverfe black bars; legs dufky, armed with fpurs. Female lefs, varied with brown, gray, rufous, and blackifh; cheeks feathered; and, after the has done breeding, puts on the appearance of the male. There are feveral varieties. This beaufiful bird is about nineteen inches long, and weighs from two pounds twelve ounces to three pounds four ounces. It is faid to have been brought from the ifland of Colchis.\nGallinae. chis by the Argonauts; is a native of Africa, and very common in almost all the southern parts of the old continent, whence it was originally imported into Great Britain. Pheasants are much attached to the shelter of thickets and woods, where the grass is very long; but they also often breed in clover fields. They form their nests on the ground, and the females lay from twelve to fifteen eggs, which are smaller than those of the domestic hen. The nest is usually composed of a few dry vegetables put carelessly together, and the young follow the mother like chickens, as soon as they break the shell. The parents and their brood remain in the stubble and hedge rows, undisturbed, for some time after the corn is ripe. If disturbed, they seek the woods, and only come forth in the mornings and evenings to feed in the stubble. Though very fond of corn, they are often obliged to content themselves with wild berries and acorns. In confinement, the female neither lays too many eggs, nor hatches and rears her brood with so much care and vigilance as in the fields. In a new life will very rarely dispose her eggs in a nest, or sit on them at all; and the domestic hen is usually entrusted with the charge of incubation and rearing the young. The wings of the pheasant are very short, and ill adapted for considerable flights. As the cold weather approaches, these birds begin to fly at sunset among the branches of oak trees for roosting during the night; and thus they do more frequently as the winter advances, and the trees lose their foliage. The male birds at these times make a noise, which they repeat three or four times, and which the sportmen call cooing. The hens on flying up utter one shrill whistle, and then are silent. Poachers avail themselves of these notes, and, unless the woods are strictly watched, secure the birds with the greatest certainty. The crowing of the males, which begins in the first week of March, may be heard at a considerable distance. During the breeding season, the cocks will sometimes intermix with the common hen, and produce a hybrid breed. The pheasant does not appear to pair, for the female carefully hides her nest from the male; and where they are in plenty, and food provided for them, the two sexes are said in general not to feed together. In a domestic state, they are sometimes more or less mixed with white, and sometimes wholly so. A variety with a white ring round the neck, and whence called the ring pheasant, is not uncommon in some parts of England. This species rarely occurs in Scotland.\n\nArgus pheasant.—Pale yellow, spotted with black; face red; hind head crested, blue; bill yellowish; orbits and whiskers black; front, chin, and throat red; hind-head and nape blue; wings gray, with eye-like spots; tail wedged, the colour of the wings; two middle feathers three feet long, with large eye-spots at the shaft; feet armed; size of a turkey. Inhabits Chinese Tartary and Sumatra. This is a most beautiful bird, though its colours are not brilliant. It is with great difficulty kept alive for any time after it has been caught in the woods. It seems to have an antipathy to the light, being quite inanimate in the open day; but when kept in a dark place, it appears to be perfectly at ease, and sometimes makes its call, which is rather plaintive, and not harsh like that of the peacock. The flesh resembles that of the common pheasant.\n\nImpeyan pheasant.—Crested, purple, glossy green, black beneath; feathers of the neck with a changeable lustre of gold, copper, and green; tail entire, rufous; larger than a common fowl. Inhabits India, but not plentifully, being brought from the hills in the northern parts of Hindustan to Calcutta, as curiosities. Lady Impey attempted, with great probability of success, to bring over with her some of them to England; but after living in health on board the ship for two months, they caught a disorder from the rest of the poultry, similar to the smallpox, and died in consequence. They bear cold, but are impatient of heat. The cock was never observed to crow, but had a strong hoarse cackle, not unlike that of a pheasant.—Described and figured by Latham.\n\nCrested pheasant.—Brown above; beneath reddish-white; vent rufous; head crested; orbits red, naked; tail wedge-shaped, and tipped with yellow; bill and unarmed legs black; feathers of the crest whitish-brown; beneath black; feathers from the hind head to the lower part of the neck have a white streak down the middle; covert of the wings at the tip and edge white; quill feathers rufous; tail ten inches long; length of body 22 inches. Native of New Spain. Frequent trees in the neighbourhood of water, and feeds on worms, insects, and serpents.\n\nPainted pheasant.—Crest yellow; breast scarlet; secondary quill feathers blue; tail wedged; bill, irides, and armed legs, yellow; feathers of the crest silky, and hanging backwards; cheeks naked and flesh coloured; feathers of the hind head tawny, with black lines, and beneath these green ones; back and rump yellow; upper tail covert long, narrow, and scarlet; wing covert varied with bay and brown; scapulars blue; quill feathers brown, with yellowish spots; tail feathers varied bay and black, and 23 inches long. Female reddish brown; yellowish brown beneath; legs unarmed; less than the common pheasant; length two feet nine inches and a half. The native country of this beautiful species is China, where it is called Kin-ki. It bears confinement well, and will breed readily in that state. The eggs are redder than those of the common pheasant, and somewhat resemble those of the Guinea fowl. An instance of their breeding with the common pheasant is mentioned by Buffon. Edwards informs us, that some females of this species, kept by Lady Essex, in the space of five years gradually gained the male feathers; and we are told, that it is not unusual for the hen birds, when about four or five years old, to be neglected by the cocks, and gradually to gain the plumage of the males.\n\nSuperb pheasant.—Unarmed; rufous, varied with green and blue; caruncles of the front rounded; wattles awl-shaped; bill and body red; each side of the neck with long feathers turned back; crown green; the hind part with a folding blue crest; shoulders green, spotted with white; primary quill feathers blue; tail long, wedged, the feathers varied with blue and red; covert declined, and of various mixed colours; legs yellow. Inhabits China.\n\nGen. 73. Numidia, Pintado, or Guinea Fowl.\n\nBill strong and short; the base covered with a carunculated cere, receiving the nostrils; head horned, with a compressed coloured callus; tail short, bending down; body speckled.\nCommon Guinea hen.—Caruncles at the gape double, and no gular fold; bill of a reddish horn colour; head blue; the crown with a conical, compressed, bluish red protuberance; upper part of the neck bluish ash, almost naked; lower feathered, verging to violet; body black, with round white spots; legs gray brown; gular caruncle of the male bluish; of the female red. There is a variety with the breast white, and another with the body entirely white; somewhat larger than the common hen. Inhabits Africa, and is domesticated in most parts of Europe, the West Indies, and America. It formed a part of the Roman banquets, and is now much esteemed as a delicacy, especially when young. The female lays a great number of eggs, which she frequently secretes till she has produced her young brood. The eggs are smaller than those of a common hen, and of a rounder shape, and are delicious eating. The Guinea hen is a restless and very clamorous bird, and has a harsh creaking note, which is peculiarly grating and unpleasant. Like the common domestic fowl it scurries the ground, and rolls in the dust to free itself from insects. During the night it perches on high places, and, if disturbed, alarms the neighbourhood by its unceasing cry. In its natural state of freedom it is said to prefer marshy places. It is easily tamed, but often abandons its young.\n\nGen. 74. Tetrao.\n\nNear the eyes, a spot which is either naked, or papillose, or rarely covered with feathers.\n\nThe birds of this genus have a strong convex bill; grouse, partridges, and quails, agree in having a short convex bill. The grouse chiefly inhabits the colder regions, and is distinguished by small nostrils, hid under the feathers; an acute tongue; strong feet; and a pretty long tail. Partridges and quails are less in size; have a short tail; and their nostrils covered above with a callosus prominent margin. They inhabit the temperate and even the warmer climates. The tinamous are a tribe peculiar to Guiana, and approach the pheasant in manners. Their bill is longer and obtuse at the apex; the nostrils are placed in the middle; their gape is very wide; the throat thinly covered with feathers; the tail very short; the back-toe short, and useless for running. The female is larger than the male.\n\nA. Spot over the eyes naked; legs downy. Grouse.\n\nWood grouse, cock of the wood, or capercailzie.—Tail rounded; arm-pits white; bill horn colour; spot above the eyes scarlet; irides hazel; nostrils covered with short feathers; feathers of the chin black, longer; head and neck cinereous, with fine transverse black lines; body bay, with blackish lines above; breast blackish green; belly and vent black, varied with white; tail feathers 18, each side spotted with white; legs robust and brown; toes pectinated at the edge. Of the female the bill is dusky; chin red; body with alternate red and black transverse lines above; breast with a few white spots, the lower part orange; belly spotted with pale orange and black, the feathers tipped with white; shoulders black, the feathers edged with black and pale tawny, and tipped with white; tail rufly, barred with black, and tipped with white. In size, this species is little inferior to a turkey, and sometimes weighs 12 or 13, but more frequently seven or eight pounds. The male Gallinga is two feet nine inches, and the female two feet two inches long. Inhabits the mountainous and woody parts of Europe and northern Asia. It is not uncommon in the pine-forests of Normandy, in Russia and Siberia, in Italy, and several parts of the Alps. In Scotland and Ireland it is nearly extinct. It feeds on the berries of the juniper and vaccinium, and on the seeds of the pine tribe and other trees. It is a solitary bird, except in the season of love, when, in the beginning of February, perched on the top of a tree, it calls the females about it with a loud voice, its tail expanded, its wings hanging down to its feet, its neck stretched out, and the feathers of its head erected. The female builds on the ground among mosses, and lays from eight to fifteen eggs. The flesh of this species is much esteemed, and its eggs are accounted preferable to those of every other bird. They are white, spotted with yellow, and larger than those of the common hen. The young follow the hen as soon as they are hatched, and sometimes with part of the shell attached to them.\n\nBlack game, black grouse, or black cock.—Violet Tetrix.\n\nblack; tail forked; secondary quill feathers white towards the base; bill black; body shining glaucous-black; wing coverts black-brown; four first quill feathers black, the rest white at the base; tail feathers from 16 to 18, black; legs black-brown; toes pectinated. Female less; the weight of an old cock is nearly four pounds, but that of the female is not often more than two. Length about 23 inches: there are several varieties. Inhabits mountainous and woody parts of Europe. In Britain it is chiefly confined to the northern parts of the kingdom, and especially to the Highlands of Scotland; population and culture having driven them from the south, except in a few of the more wild uncultivated parts, as in the New Forest in Hampshire, Dartmoor and Sedgemoor in Devonshire, and the heathy hills in Somersetshire contiguous to the latter. It also occurs in Staffordshire, North Wales, and the north of England. It feeds principally on the tops of heath and birch, except when the mountain berries are ripe, at which time it devours billberries and cranberries with the greatest voracity. In the month of April the male places himself on an eminence, at morning dawn, and invites the females by crowing and clapping his wings. The males are polygamous, and fight desperately for the females. They afterwards associate peaceably in small packs, are fond of woody, heathy, and mountainous situations; but occasionally visit the corn fields in autumn, retiring wholly to woods in the winter, and perching on trees. It is somewhat remarkable that they are killed by eating cherries or pears. The female forms an artless nest on the ground, and lays six or eight eggs, of a dull yellowish white colour, marked with numerous very small ferruginous specks, and with blotches of the same towards the smaller end. The young are hatched very late in summer. The young males quit their parent in the beginning of winter, and keep together in flocks of seven or eight till the spring. They do not acquire their male garb till towards the end of autumn, when the plumage gradually changes to a deeper colour, and assumes that of a bluish-black, which it afterwards retains.\n\nPtarmigan, white grouse, or white game.—Cinereous; Lagopus. toes downy; quill feathers white; tail feathers black, tipped\nGallinæa: tipped with white, the middle ones white; body, in summer cinereous, varied with white and brown, in winter nearly all white; but in all seasons the lateral tail feathers are black, tipped with white; legs and toes covered with a thick wool like a hare's. From 14 to 15 inches long. Inhabits the Alpine parts of Europe and Siberia. In this country it is met with only on the summits of our highest hills, chiefly in the Highlands of Scotland, and sometimes, but rarely, on the lofty hills of Cumberland and Wales. As the snow melts on the sides of the mountains, it constantly ascends till it gains the summit, where it forms holes and burrows in the snow. These birds pair at the same time with the red grouse; the female lays eight or ten white eggs, spotted with brown, not in any regular nest but on the ground. In winter they fly in flocks, and are so little accustomed to the sight of man, that they are easily shot, or taken in a snare. They feed on the wild productions of the hills, as the buds of trees, the young shoots of pines, the heath, crow-berry, rhododendron, &c. They fly swiftly, fly heavily, are impatient of the sun and wind, and are unsuited to the climate of domestication. The flesh of the young is accounted a great delicacy. That of the full-grown birds has sometimes a bitter, but not unpalatable taste; it is also dark coloured, and, according to Buffon, approaches in flavour to that of the hare.\n\nWhite grouse.—Orange, varied with black bands and white blotches; toes downy; tail feathers black, tipped with white, the middle ones entirely white; bill black; belly and legs white; claws broad and flat. Upwards of 16 inches long. Inhabits the woods of Europe and Asia, and, like the preceding, grows white in winter.\n\nPinnated grouse.—Back of the neck with supplemental wings, which are wanting in the female. The male is smaller than a partridge. Inhabits North America; feeds chiefly on acorns; and at sunrise erects his neck wings, and sings for the space of half an hour.\n\nHazel grouse.—Tail feathers cinereous, with black spots and a black band, except the two middle ones. Fourteen inches long. Inhabits the hazel woods of Europe; feeds on catkins; when terrified, erects the feathers of the crown.\n\nRed grouse, or moorcock.—Transversely streaked with rufous and blackish; six outer tail-feathers blackish on each side; caruncle on the eyebrows lunated and scarlet; greater quill-feathers brown; tail feathers sixteen, the four middle ones the colour of the back, the rest blackish. Length fifteen inches; weight about nineteen ounces. This species is only to be met with in the extensive uncultivated wastes that are covered with heath, particularly the most mountainous situations, having been driven from the south by cultivation. It still occurs in the mountains of Wales, and in the moorlands of Yorkshire and the north of England, but is nowhere so plentiful as in the Highlands of Scotland, and in the waste moors of North Britain, in general. It is also found in the Western islands, and in the mountains and bogs of Ireland; but seems to be unknown on the continent of Europe, those mentioned by Buffon as natives of France, Spain, Italy, &c., either forming a distinct species, or at least a variety. Linnaeus did not seem to be acquainted with it, and Gmelin gave it as a variety of the ptarmigan. The red grouse never resort to woods, but confine themselves wholly to the open moors, feeding on the mountain and bog berries; and, in defect of these, on the tops of the heath. They pair in the spring; and the female lays from 8 to 14 eggs, much like those of the black grouse, but smaller, on the ground. The young keep with the parent birds till towards winter, and are called a pack, or brood. In November they flock together in greater numbers, sometimes to the amount of thirty or forty, and are then extremely shy and difficult to be shot.\n\nB. Orbits granulated; legs naked.\n\nGreek, or red partridge.—Bill and legs blood-red; Rufus. Chin white, surrounded with a black band, and spotted with white; feathers of the sides with a double black stripe; tail feathers fourteen, cinereous, the five outer rufous for the last half. Rather larger than the next species. Inhabits various parts of southern Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Greek islands. A variety called the Guernsey, or red-legged partridge, has sometimes been found on the Suffolk or Norfolk coasts. It is distinguished by a single black stripe on the feathers of the sides, and fifteen tail feathers, of which the five outer are rufous on each side. The red partridge frequently perches on a tree, and will breed in confinement, which the common one is never known to do.\n\nCommon partridge.—A naked scarlet spot under the eyes; tail ferruginous; breast brown; legs white; face yellowish; cap and neck waved ash; quill feathers brown, with ferruginous bands; tail feathers eighteen, lower part of the breast with two chestnut spots. Several varieties of this species are enumerated by ornithologists, but most of them appear to be accidental. Length about 13 inches; weight 15 ounces. Inhabits Europe and Asia, though chiefly in temperate regions, the extremes of heat and cold being equally unfavourable to it. They are nowhere in greater plenty than in this island, where, in their season, they contribute to our most elegant entertainments. They haunt corn fields, and are never found at any distance from arable land. They pair early in the spring; and the female is very prolific, laying from 12 to 20 eggs. It makes no nest, but scrapes a small hole in the ground, and throws into it a few contiguous fibres, on which to deposit the eggs. The old birds fit very close on the latter when near hatching. The incubation lasts three weeks, and the young birds learn to run as soon as hatched, frequently with part of the shell sticking to them. It is no uncommon thing to introduce partridges' eggs under the common hen, who hatches and rears them as her own; but, in this case, the young birds require to be fed with the larvae of ants, which are their favourite food, and without which it is almost impossible to rear them. They likewise eat insects, and, when full grown, feed on all kinds of grain and young plants. \"The affection of the partridge for her young (says Mr Bewick), is peculiarly strong and lively; she is greatly afflicted in the care of rearing them by her mate: they lead them out in common, call them together, point out to them their proper food, and assist them in finding it by scratching the ground with their feet; they frequently sit close by each other, covering the chickens with their wings like the hen. In this situation they are not easily flushed; the sportsman, who is attentive to the preservation of his game, will carefully avoid giving any disturbance to a scene...\"\nscene so truly interesting; but should the pointer come too near, or unfortunately run in upon them, there are few who are ignorant of the confusion that follows: the male first gives the signal of alarm by a peculiar cry of distress, throwing himself at the same moment more immediately into the way of danger, in order to deceive or mislead the enemy; he flies, or rather runs, along the ground, hanging his wings, and exhibiting every symptom of delirium, whereby the dog is decoyed, in the too eager expectation of an easy prey, to a distance from the covey; the female flies off in a contrary direction, and to a greater distance, but returning soon after by secret ways, she finds her scattered brood closely situated among the grass, and, collecting them with haste, she leads them from the danger, before the dog has had time to return from his pursuit.\"\n\nb. Legs without a spur. Quail.\n\nGreen quail.—Green; bill and legs reddish; wings chestnut, speckled with black; bill a little bent at the tip; hind toe unarmed; tail and vent black. Between 11 and 12 inches long.\n\nCalifornia quail.—Lead colour; crown with an upright crest; throat black, edged with white; belly yellowish brown, with black creolents. The female wants the black throat and whitish margin. Larger than the common quail. Inhabits California.\n\nNatal quail.—Varied with yellowish, rufous, black, and gray; bill longer than in others of the genus. A very clamorous bird, which inhabits the woods in Java.\n\nChinese quail.—Body spotted with gray; throat black, with a white arch. From four to six inches long. Inhabits China and the Philippine isles, and is carried alive by the Chinese, in the winter, between their hands, for the purpose of warming them.\n\nCommon quail.—Body spotted with gray; eyebrows white; tail feathers with a ferruginous edge and crescent; bill black; head black, varied with rufous; a yellowish streak down the middle of the crown and neck; feathers of the neck rusty brown, varied with gray; the shafts with a longitudinal yellowish streak; body beneath dirty ochreous; throat and breast reddish; quill feathers gray-brown, with rufous bars on the outside; tail feathers twelve, with reddish and black lines; legs brownish. Seven inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. When these birds migrate to and from the north, they are found in prodigious quantities in all the islands of the Archipelago. One hundred thousand, it is said, have been taken in one day on the west coast of the kingdom of Naples. A small portion only extend their flight to this country. With us they appear about the beginning of May, in our cultivated campaign districts, though not in such numbers as formerly. On their first arrival, the males are constantly uttering a whistling note, thrice successively repeated, which being imitated by a whistle or quail-call, they are easily enticed into a net. Before the revolution, great quantities used to be sent alive from France to the London market. In confinement they fatten, and seem to lose much of their fierce and pugnacious disposition. The female deposits eight or ten yellowish eggs, blotched, or spotted with dusky, on the bare ground, and usually with us among green wheat. The young birds follow the mother as soon as hatched, but do not continue long together; for they are scarcely grown up when they separate, or, if kept together, they fight obstinately, and frequently destroy one another. From this quarrelsome disposition it was, that the Greeks and Romans used them as game cocks; and that the Chinese, and some of the Italians are, at this day, addicted to the diversion of quail-fighting. After feeding two quails very highly, they place them opposite to each other, and throw in a few grains of feed between them, when the birds rush on each other with the utmost fury, striking with their bills and heels till one of them yields.\n\nC. Orbits with a few feathers; legs naked, four-toed, and unarmed. Tinamou.\n\nCayenne tinamou.—Bill and legs brown; back ash-brown, varied with blackish stripes; chin cinereous; belly pale orange. Eleven inches long. Inhabits Cayenne and Guiana.\n\nGreat tinamou.—Legs yellowish-brown; bill black; crown rufous; body olive; back and tail with black spots. Eighteen inches long. Inhabits the woods of South America; roosts on the lower branches of trees; feeds on worms, insects, seeds and fruits; builds twice a year, at the root of a large tree, and lays from twelve to fifteen green eggs.\n\nLittle tinamou.—Bill and legs yellow; head and neck black; body brown above, rufous beneath; chin mixed with white; quill feathers brown. Nine inches long. Inhabits Guiana. Builds an hemispherical nest in the branches of trees.\n\nORDER VI. PASSERES.\n\nBill conical, pointed; nostrils oval, pervious, and naked.\n\nThe birds of this order have the feet formed for walking or hopping. They live, some at the time of breeding, and others constantly, in monogamy. Some which feed on the seeds of plants have a short bill, others that live on insects and worms are generally furnished with a longer bill. They nestle on trees, in bushes, in houses, and on the ground. They often build very artificial nests, and feed their young with their bill. This order includes all the fining birds; the males are the songsters. They are for the most part eatable.\n\nGen. 75. COLUMBA, Pigeon.\n\nBill straight, descending towards the tip; nostrils oblong, and half covered with a soft tumid membrane.\n\nThe birds of this genus have a weak and slender bill, short feet, and many of them red toes, divided to their origin. They extend their residence even to the arctic regions. They drink much, and not at intervals like other birds, but by continuous draughts like quadrupeds. Their note is plaintive or mournful. They form the connecting link between this and the preceding order; but are more nearly related to the passerine tribes, in being monogamous, in caring for each other by their bills, in the male and female alternately hatching, in both joining to feed the young, in laying but few eggs, and in their nidification. Of upwards of seventy species which belong to this genus, only five or six are natives of\nA. Tail even and moderate.\n\nCommon, or flock pigeon, or flock dove.—Bluish; neck above glossy green; double band on the wings, and tip of the tail blackish; throat and breast claret colour; claws black. Length 13 or 14 inches; weight 11 ounces. Inhabits Europe and Siberia; is wild in many places, but is kept in pigeon-houses everywhere, and is the parent stock whence all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived, and is on that account called the flock-dove. It builds in towers, in caverns of rocks, and in cliffs in unfrequented islands. On the approach of winter, it migrates southward. It is gregarious; lays two eggs, and breeds several times in the year.\n\nDomestic pigeon.—Cinerous; rump white; band on the wings, and tip of the tail blackish. The varieties are, however, very numerous, and not easily reducible to distinct descriptions. Some of the more remarkable are, the rock, Roman, Barbary, Jacobine, flaker, tumbler, carrier, horseman, and turner pigeons. From 14 to 15 inches long. Inhabits and is domesticated in almost every part of Europe and Asia, and lays from nine to eleven times a year. Though only two eggs are laid at a time, at the expiration of four years, the produce and descendants of a single pair may amount to nearly 15,000. A composition of loam, old rubbish and salt, will not only entice birds of this species to remain in a required spot, but will even decoy those belonging to other places, and is therefore prohibited by law. The carrier pigeon is easily distinguished from the other varieties, by a broad circle of naked white skin round the eyes, and by its dark blue or blackish colour. The bird is conveyed from its home to the place whence the information is intended to be sent; the letter is tied under its wing, and it is let loose. From the instant of its liberation, its flight is directed through the clouds, at an amazing height, to its home, and it darts onward in a straight line to the very spot from which it was taken, by virtue of some faculty or instinct which it is very difficult to explain. To measure their speed with some degree of exactness, a gentleman some years ago, on a trifling wager, sent a carrier-pigeon from London, by the coach, to a friend at St Edmund's-bury, and along with it a note, requesting that the pigeon, two days after its arrival there, might be thrown up precisely when the town-clock struck nine in the morning. This was accordingly done, and the pigeon arrived in London, and flew into the Bull Inn in Bishop's-Gate Street, at half an hour past eleven o'clock of the same morning, having flown 72 miles in two hours and a half.\n\nGreat crowned Indian pigeon.—Bluish; cinereous above; orbits black; crest; shoulders ferruginous. Size of a turkey. Inhabits New Guinea.\n\nLesser crowned pigeon.—Eyelids white; hind head with a red gold crest; breast and belly violet; back, rump, and tail green; legs yellow; hind toe unarmed. Size of the common pigeon. Inhabits Malacca.\n\nRing dove.—Cinerous; tail feathers black on the hind part; primary quill feathers whitish on the outer edge; neck white on each side; bill yellowish; cere red and fleshy; irides yellowish; head, back, and wing coverts bluish; rump and throat pale ash; breast claret colour; belly and vent whitish; neck above and at the sides green gold, with a white crescent on each side; feet rough as far as the toes. Weighs about 20 ounces; length eight inches. Inhabits Europe, and rarely Siberia. From its living in woods, and building in trees, it is not uncommonly called wood pigeon. It seems to be originally a native of this island, and probably migrates no farther than from the northern to the southern parts of it. Early in spring it begins to pair, at which time the male is observed to fly in a singular manner, alternately rising and falling in the air. It forms a nest of a few small sticks loosely put together. Its common food is grain and seeds of all kinds, acorns and beech-nuts, and in default of these, turnip-greens, and young clover, or even green corn, and ivy berries. Various attempts to domesticate this species have proved unsuccessful.\n\nGreen turtle.—Breast-green above, purple-violet beneath. Near eight inches long. Inhabits Ambona.\n\nTurtle dove.—Tail feathers tipped with white; back Turtur-gray; breast flesh coloured; a spot of black feathers, tipped with white, on each side of the neck; bill brown; irides yellow; crown olive-ash; front and chin nearly white; scapulars and coverts reddish-brown, spotted with black; throat and breast claret coloured; belly and vent white; two middle tail feathers dusky brown, the end and exterior side of the outermost feathers white. Subject to several varieties. About 12 inches long. Inhabits Europe, China, and India. Visits the southern parts of England in the spring, and leaves them in the beginning of September. Is very shy and retired, breeding in thick woods, and netting on high trees. Is very destructive to fields of peas.\n\nB. Tail long and wedged.\n\nPassenger pigeon.—Orbits naked and fangmine; breast rufous. From 15 to 16 inches long. Inhabits North America, migrating southward in December in quest of food. The multitudes which pass in hard winters are truly astonishing, as they fly by millions in a flock, and literally intercept the light of the sun. As soon as one flock has passed, another succeeds; and these movements sometimes continue for three days without intermission. Their favourite food is acorns; but they not only eat the fruit of various kinds of trees, but also corn and rice, of which they are very unsparing in the course of their passage.\n\nBlack-winged pigeon.—Body livid; wings black. Inhabits Chili.\n\nMarginated turtle.—Breast red; tail feathers tipped Margina-with black, and edged with white; bill horny; irides rufous; front and chin reddish brown; lores white; hind head bluish-ash colour; a black spot under the ears; body above brown; shoulders spotted with black; rump cinereous; throat and breast rosy; two middle tail feathers blackish; the rest ash colour. Ten inches long. Native of America.\n\nBantam pigeon.—Orbits naked and flesh coloured; Bantam-neck, breast, and flanks, waved with black and white. Size of the wry-neck. Inhabits Java.\n\nGen. 76. Alauda, Lark.\n\nBill cylindrical, subulated, straight; the mandibles equal, and a little gaping at the base; tongue bifid; hind claw straight, and longer than the toe.\nField, or sky lark.—Outer webs of the two middle tail feathers white, middle ones ferruginous on the inner side; body above varied with blackish, reddish-gray, and whitish; reddish-white beneath; bill and legs black; throat spotted with black. A variety sometimes occurs that is wholly white, another which is black-brown, and a third, which is found in Russia, and distinguished by its very long legs. This well-known species is about seven inches long, and inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is most common in the open and upland cultivated districts in which corn abounds, and is rarely seen on extended moors at a distance from arable land. The nest is placed on the ground, among grass or corn, and is formed of dry grass and other vegetable stalks, and lined with fine dry grass. The eggs are generally four, rather larger than those of a tit-lark, and of a dirty white, blotched and spotted with brown. The sky lark begins to breed in May, and will lay as late as September, if its first nests are destroyed. The incubation lasts a fortnight, and two broods are usually produced in the course of the year. When hatched, the mother watches over them with the most tender solicitude and affection. They are first fed with worms and insects; but after they are grown up, they live chiefly on seeds, herbage, and most other vegetable substances. They are easily tamed, and become so familiar as to eat off the table, and even alight on the hand. The lark becomes tuneful early in spring, and continues so during the summer. His song is chiefly heard in the morning and evening; and he is one of those few birds that chant their mellownotes on the wing. We need scarcely remark, that he mounts almost perpendicularly, and by successive springs into the air, where he hovers at a great height, and whence he descends in an oblique direction, unless threatened by some ravenous bird of prey, or attracted by his mate, when he drops down to the ground like a stone. When he first leaves the earth, his notes are feeble and interrupted, but, as he rises, they gradually swell to their full tone. These birds cease their strains in winter, when they assemble in flocks, grow fat, and are taken in multitudes by the bird-catchers. Four thousand dozens have been taken in the neighbourhood of Dunstable, between September and February; and Kepler informs us, that the excise on larks alone produces about 900l. a year to the city of Leipzig, whose neighbourhood is celebrated for larks of a peculiarly delicate flavour.\n\nTit lark.—Greenish-brown, outer webs of the two outermost tail feathers white; eyebrows with a white line; bill black; body white beneath; breast ochreous yellow, with oblong black spots; legs yellowish. Length nearly five inches and three quarters. Inhabits Europe, and is very common in most parts of this island, though it seems partial to barren situations, and occurs both in mountainous and low swampy places. In Scotland, it is almost the only bird which frequents the extensive heath tracts on which it breeds. It has a fine note, and sings either fitting in trees, or on the ground.\n\nLeffer field lark.—Reddish-brown, spotted beneath; chin and belly white; throat and breast obscure yellow; legs brownish; wing coverts edged with white; quill feathers dusky, the outer web of the first edged with white, the others with yellowish-green; hind claw short, and sometimes hooked. Somewhat larger than the preceding, with which it has been often confounded. It visits this country in spring, but is rarely seen till the beginning of May; is not plentiful, and chiefly affects enclosed situations. From the beginning of May till July, it may be seen mounting in the air in a fluttering manner, at the same time uttering a twittering note, and then descending to some neighbouring tree with motionless wing and the tail thrown up. It then sings sweetly, but never when rising. It generally nests in the high grass or green wheat, and lays four eggs of a dirty bluish white, thickly blotched, and spotted with purplish brown.\n\nWood lark.—Head surrounded by a white annular fillet; body varied like the arvensis; legs flesh coloured. Weighs about eight drams; length six inches. Inhabits Europe and Siberia, and is met with, though sparingly, in various parts of Britain. It sings delightfully on wing, but rarely when sitting on the ground, though sometimes when perched on a tree. Its song is much more melodious than that of the sky lark, but does not consist of so great a variety of notes; but then it frequently sings in the night, and through most of the year, except in the months of June and July. It does not ascend in the air perpendicularly, and continue hovering and singing in the same spot, like the sky lark, but will sometimes soar to a great height, and keep flying in large irregular circles, singing with little intermission; and will thus continue in the air for an hour together. It is an early breeder, the eggs being sometimes found in the nest in the beginning of April.\n\nRed lark.—Brown; orbits blackish; two outermost tail feathers white. About the size of the sky lark. Inhabits North America, and is sometimes found near London.\n\nMalabar lark.—Wings and tail dirty brown colour, with reddish edges; bill black; crest long, brown and tipped with white; chin and belly reddish white; feathers of the back, and coverts of the wings, brown; the edge reddish towards the tip, and marked with a white spot; legs reddish. Five inches and a half long. Native of Malabar.\n\nGrasshopper lark, or grasshopper warbler.—Tail feathers brown, the outer one half white, the second with a white wedged tip; wings with two whitish lines; bill dusky; legs whitish; lores white; body greenish-brown above, feathers dusky in the middle, yellowish-white beneath; breast dirty white; tail longish, and somewhat wedged. Length five inches and a half; weight about three drams and a quarter. Inhabits Europe. Though not plentiful in Britain, it perhaps appears to be much less from its extreme thyness, and its habit of concealing itself among furze and thick hedges. Its fingural note resembles the chirping of the larger species of crickets.\n\nRock lark.—Olive brown, varied with blackish; yellowish beneath; sides of the neck and breast with brownish spots; outermost tail feathers obliquely half whitish, second whitish at the tip. Upwards of seven inches long. In its song, manner of flying, and general habits, is much allied to the tit-lark. Inhabits some of the rocky shores of England, and seems to subsist chiefly on marine insects.\n\nLeffer crested lark.—Tail feathers black, the two outermost white on the outer edge; head crested; legs red; body pale brown. Inhabits Europe and Siberia, and is\nCalandra lark.—Outermost tail feathers totally white without, second and third tipped with white; pectoral band brown. Seven inches and a quarter long. Inhabits Italy and Russia. Builds on the ground. Sings sweetly, and imitates the notes of other birds.\n\nGen. 77. Sturnus, Stare, or Starling.\n\nBill subulate, angular, depressed, somewhat blunt; the upper mandible entire, and somewhat open at the edges; nostrils surrounded with a prominent rim; tongue notched and pointed.\n\nCommon starling.—Bill yellowish; body black, with white dots; quill feathers and tail dusky; the former edged with yellow on the outer side, the latter with dirty green; lesser coverts edged with yellow, and slightly glossed with green; legs reddish-brown. Male shining with purple, green, and gold. There are several varieties. Weight about three ounces; length eight inches and three quarters. Found in almost every part of the old continent. It breeds in the hollows of trees or rocks, among rubbish, or in old towers, and sometimes appropriates the nest of another bird. Myriads of this species breed among the rocks in the Orkney islands, and in winter feed on the cancer pulex. Their general food is insects, earthworms, seeds, berries, &c. They migrate in flocks, and are very noisy. In confinement it may be taught to mimic various sounds, and even to speak. So attached are they to society, that they not only join those of their own species, but also birds of a different kind; and are frequently seen in company with redwings, fieldfares, and even with pigeons, jackdaws, and owls. They chatter much in the evening and morning, both when they assemble and disperse.\n\nWater-ousel, or crane.—Black; breast white; chin white; tail black; belly ferruginous; legs pale blue before, black behind. Length seven inches and a half. Inhabits Europe and northern Persia. Is shy and solitary, and rarely to be seen, except on the banks of rivers and streams of water. It is not unfrequent in the mountainous parts of Scotland and Wales, and in some districts in Devonshire. In these places it breeds, and continues the whole year. The nest is very large, formed externally of moss and water plants, and lined with dry oak leaves, resembling that of the wren, with a dome or covering. It is usually placed in some mossy bank, impending on the water, and contains five or six eggs of a transparent white. \"A pair of these birds,\" says Mr Montagu, which had for many years built under a small wooden bridge in Caernarvonshire, we found had made a nest early in May. It was taken, but had no eggs, although the bird flew out of it at the time. In a fortnight after they had completed another nest in the same place, containing five eggs, which was taken; and in a month after we took a third nest under the same bridge with four eggs; undoubtedly the work of the same birds, as no others were seen about that part. At the time the last was taken, the female was sitting, and the infant quitted her nest, plunged into the water, and disappeared for a considerable time; at last she emerged at a great distance down the stream. At another time we found a nest of this bird in a steep projecting bank over a rivulet clothed with moss. The nest was so well adapted to the surrounding materials, that nothing but the old bird flying in with a fish in its bill would have led to a discovery. The young were nearly full feathered, but incapable of flight, and the moment the nest was disturbed, they fluttered out and dropped into the water, and to our astonishment, instantly vanished; but in a little time made their appearance at some distance down the stream; and it was with difficulty two out of five were taken, as they dived on being approached.\n\nThe aquatic habits of this bird have not escaped the notice of ornithologists, some of whom speak of their flying under water. If, indeed, the wings being in motion can be called flying, it certainly does; but this is no more than is common to all diving birds, which, in pursuit of fish, or to escape danger, always use their wings to accelerate their motion. In this case, however, the wings are not extended, for that would retard their progress; but it is affected by short jerks from the shoulder joint. Whether these birds can run at the bottom of the water, as some have asserted, is much to be doubted, as it is requisite all birds should use a considerable exertion to keep them under water, by reason of their specific gravity being so much less. It is certainly a most curious and singular circumstance, that a bird, not apparently in the least formed for diving, should pursue its prey under water, living chiefly on small fish and aquatic insects. It cannot, however, swim on the surface.\"\n\nGreen starling.—Green above; bluish beneath; a tuft viridis of black and white feathers on the front and chin. Inhabits China.\n\nWattled starling.—Bill and legs black; a pendent carunculae orange wattles at each angle of the mouth. Male black, with the back and wing-coverts ferruginous. Female rufly-brown, with very small wattles. Ten inches long. Inhabits New Zealand.\n\nCollared starling.—Blackish-brown, spotted with brown; flanks rufous; chin white, spotted with brown. Size of the fieldfare. Inhabits Switzerland and Italy. Is solitary, wags its tail, feeds on seeds, sings with a very weak voice, and builds in the ground, or in clefts of rocks.\n\nGen. 78. Turdus, Thrush.\n\nBill somewhat straight; upper mandible a little bending and notched near the point; nostrils naked or half covered with a small membrane; mouth ciliated with a few bristles at the corners; tongue jagged.\n\nMost of the numerous species of this genus feed on berries, especially those of the juniper; and many of them are excellent songsters.\n\nMistle thrush.—Back brown; neck spotted with white; bill yellowish; body whitish-yellow beneath, with spots brown on the chin and white beneath; quill and tail feathers brown, with paler edges; the three outermost tipped with white; legs yellow; claws black. Weight near five ounces; length 11 inches. Inhabits the woods of Europe. It is by no means plentiful in Britain, and appears to be less so in winter. It begins to sing in January if the weather is mild, but ceases as soon as the thermometer sinks below 40 degrees. About\nabout the middle of March it makes a nest in the fork of some tree, especially if covered with lichen, and seems partial to the apple tree, frequenting orchards more than other situations in spring, and never building in a bush. The nest is made of mosses, lichens, and dry leaves, lined with withered grass, and fortified on the outside with small sticks. The eggs are four or five, rarely six, of a flesh colour, and marked with deep and light rust-coloured spots. The song of this bird is louder than that of the thrush, and superior to it. Perching on the uppermost branch of a tall tree, the miffel thrush sings when its mate is making the nest, and during incubation; but becomes silent as soon as the young are hatched, and is no more heard till the beginning of the new year. If the young are taken, its song continues as before, and if the female is destroyed, it continues in song the whole summer. The miffel is very bold during the breeding season, driving other birds from the neighbourhood of its nest, and even attacking the magpie and jay. Its food is insects and berries, particularly those of the millet, which are frequently propagated after passing through the digestive organs of this bird.\n\nField fare.—Tail feathers black, the outermost at the inner edge tipped with white; head and rump hoary; bill yellowish, tipped with black; crown and neck olive-buff above; body buff above; quill feathers cinnamon; throat and breast yellowish-rufous; belly and vent whitish; legs blackish. Subject to three or four varieties. Length 10 inches; weight four ounces. Inhabits Europe, Syria, and Siberia. Arrives in Britain, in large flocks, about Michaelmas, and leaves us in March. It feeds on the berries of the holly, thorn, juniper, *enepetrum nigrum*, *arbutus alpina*, &c., as well as on worms and insects. In very severe weather they migrate farther south, if not prevented by a sudden fall of snow. In 1798, when a very heavy snow fell on the northern and eastern parts of England, prodigious flocks of field fares appeared in the west; but as that part of the island also was soon covered with snow, which lay on the ground for a considerable time, they became too weak to advance farther south, and thousands were picked up, starved to death. Though it builds in trees, and sits on them in the daytime, it always roosts on the ground. When a person approaches a tree that is covered with them, they continue fearless, till one at the extremity of the bough rising on its wings, utters a loud and peculiar note of alarm, when they all immediately fly, except one other, which remains till the person approaches still nearer, and then it also flies off, repeating the note of alarm. Field fares were highly esteemed by the Roman epicures, who kept them in their aviaries, and fattened them with crumbs of bread, mixed with minced figs. According to Varro and Plutarch, the flesh was sometimes bitter.\n\nRed wing, or wind thrush.—Wings ferruginous underneath; eyebrows whitish; bill blackish; legs pale gray; body gray-brown, whitish beneath, with brown spots; sides and inner coverts ferruginous; vent white. Weight nearly two ounces and a half; length eight inches and a half. Inhabits Europe, and is a winter guest with us, appearing a few days before the preceding, migrating in vast flocks. It breeds in Sweden, Norway, &c., where it inhabits the maple woods, and sings delightfully from their highest tops. It builds in hedges or thickets, and lays six bluish-green eggs, spotted with black. In the southern countries of Europe, it does great injury to the vineyards.\n\nThrush or song thrush; mavis of the Scotch.—Quill feathers ferruginous at the inner base. Resembles the miffel in colour, but the inner wing-coverts are yellow, irides hazel, bill brown, and the mouth yellow within. Inhabits the woods in Europe. Weight about three ounces; length nine inches. This well-known species is generally admired for its song. Every wood and grove re-echoes with its notes, which sometimes vie with those of the miffel. The thrush frequently sings as early as February, if the weather is mild, and in March the female makes its nest, composed of dried grass and green moss externally, and plastered within with rotten wood, mixed with cow dung or clay, and so compactly as to hold water, a circumstance which, in a rainy season, sometimes proves fatal to the eggs. The latter are four or five, of a blue colour, and spotted with black at the larger end. The nest is sometimes placed on the stump of a tree, very near the ground, or against the side of a tree, and frequently in a hedge, or solitary bush. Though the thrush feeds on berries and insects in general, it is particularly fond of shellfish snails, especially of the *helix nemoralis*, whose shells it breaks by repeated strokes against a stone. It is not uncommon to find a great many fragments of shells together, as if a number had been conveyed to one particular stone for the purpose. This species breeds twice, and sometimes thrice in the year, and consequently continues long in song. Like the preceding, it is very hurtful to vineyards.\n\nMocking bird, or mimic thrush.—Dusky-buff above; pale ash beneath; primary quill feathers white on the outer half; bill black; irides yellow; tail four inches long; legs cinereous. Nine inches and a half long. Inhabits the moor woods of Virginia, Carolina, Jamaica, &c. In the summer is seen much more to the northward than in winter. This singular species not only possesses musical and solemn notes of its own, but can at pleasure assume the tone of every other animal in the forest, from the humming bird to the eagle, and descending even to the wolf or the raven. One of them, confined in a cage, has been heard to mimic the meowing of a cat, the chattering of a magpie, and the creaking of the hinges of a sign-post in high winds. It is said to take a pleasure in archly deceiving other birds, alluring the smaller kinds, for example, with the call of their mates, and then terrifying them with the scream of an eagle. In the warmer parts of America, it sings incessantly from March to August, both day and night, beginning with its own compositions, and frequently finishing by borrowing from the whole feathered quire, repeating its tunes with such artful sweetness as to excite both pleasure and surprise. The female frequently builds her nest in the bushes or fruit trees about houses, but is so very shy, that if a person only looks at the nest, she immediately forsakes it. It feeds on grasshoppers, different kinds of berries, &c., and is itself eaten by the Americans, who account it very delicate food.\n\nMocking thrush.—Back brown; breast and lateral Orpheus. tail feathers whitish; eyebrows white. Eight inches and a half long; inhabits South America, and resembles the last in its fine song and imitative notes.\n\nPagoda thrush.—Black; back and rump gray; vent Pagoda-white; um.\nwhite; head crested. Size of a finch. Inhabits Malabar and Coromandel, chiefly about the temples and pagodas.\n\nChilli thrush.—Gloomy black; bill somewhat striated; tail wedged; bill, eyes, legs, and flesh black; tail five inches long. About the size of the millet; is common in Chili, where it sings sweetly; imitates the notes of other birds, and, when tamed, the voice of man. Feeds on worms, seeds, and even on smaller birds, which it kills by perforating the skull with its bill. Congregates with starlings, and makes a nest of twigs and fibres, mixed with mud, and lined with hair. Lays three bluish-white eggs.\n\nRose-coloured thrush.—Pale rosy; head, wings, and tail black; hind head crested. About eight inches long. Inhabits Europe and Asia, and has been found, though very rarely, in England. As it feeds chiefly on locusts, it is held sacred by the Turks.\n\nMusician thrush.—Reddish-brown, varied with transverse dark streaks; whitish beneath; chin, cheeks, and throat reddish-orange; a black blotch spotted with white on each side of the neck. Four inches long. Inhabits the woods of Cayenne. Is solitary; feeds on ants and other insects, and is celebrated for its sweet and variable note.\n\nChiming thrush.—Brown above; under parts and rump reddish-tawny; chin white; cap and cheeks white, spotted with black; eyebrows and flecks behind the eyes black. Four inches long. Inhabits the woods of Cayenne and Guiana. Its note resembles the chiming of bells.\n\nAlarum thrush.—Brown above; white beneath; breast spotted with black; tail even; bill black above, white beneath; legs pale plumbeous. Six inches and a half long. Inhabits Cayenne. Every morning and evening, for the space of an hour, cries with a harsh loud voice, like an alarm bell.\n\nKing thrush.—Reddish-brown above, paler beneath; hind head lead-coloured; front varied with white and brown. Seven inches and a half long. Inhabits South America, near the hillocks raised by the white ants on which it feeds.\n\nBlackbird.—Black; bill and eyelids yellow. Female, and the young male rusty black, and bill dark. There is a variety with the head white, another with the body white and black, and a third entirely white. Inhabits Europe and Asia. A well-known species, admired for its song, which is a thrill kind of whistle of various notes, calling the early days of spring. The nest is externally composed of green moss, fibrous roots, &c., having the inside plastered with earth, and then lined with fine dry grass. The female lays four or five blue eggs, thickly covered with pale ferruginous brown spots. The blackbird feeds principally on worms and shelled snails, but is also fond of insects and fruit in general. It breaks the shell of the snail with great dexterity on a stone. In confinement it readily eats crumbs of bread, and flesh either raw or prepared for the table. With us, it is never observed to migrate or to congregate, but lives solitary in woods and inclosed situations. It is easily tamed, and imitates other sounds, even that of the human voice.\n\nRing ouzel.—Blackish; bill yellowish; collar white. Rather larger than the blackbird. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. Is migratory in some countries, but is known to remain and breed in the mountains of Scotland and Wales. When fattened, its flesh is much esteemed. In its habits it is nearly allied to the blackbird.\n\nReed thrush.—Rusty brown; white tesselaceous beneath; quill feathers brown, tipped with reddish. Frequently varies in its markings. Inhabits the reedy marshes of Europe, builds a hanging nest among the reeds, and lays from five to six yellowish-white eggs spotted with brown. The male sings while the female is sitting.\n\nSong thrush.—Greenish-black, shining with blue or violet; wings and tail black. Inhabits the Philippine islands in numerous flocks; sings very sweetly, and often lays in pigeon houses.\n\nGen. 79. Ampelis, Chatterer.\n\nBill straight, convex, somewhat incurved; each mandible notched; nostrils covered with bristles; tongue sharp, cartilaginous, and bifid; middle toe connected at the base to the outermost.\n\nWaxen, or Bohemian chatterer.—Hind head crested; secondary quill feathers tipped with red horny appendages; bill and legs black; irides bright ruby; cheeks tawny; throat black, with a small bristly tuft in the middle; head and body reddish-buff above; ocular line and chin black; breast and belly pale purplish-bay; lesser wing-coverts brown; greater remotest from the body black, tipped with white; quill feathers black, three first tipped with white; tip next with half an inch of the exterior edge yellow; inner white; tail black, tipped with yellow. Length about eight inches; size nearly that of a starling. Inhabits Europe, Northern Asia, and America. Occasionally visits this country, migrating in flocks. In the month of February, it frequents the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, where it feeds on the berries of the mountain ash. It is supposed to breed farther north, and to build in the holes of rocks. Its flesh is excellent.\n\nThe other species of this genus are all inhabitants of the warmer parts of America.\n\nGen. 80. Colius, Coly.\n\nBill short, thick, convex above, and flat beneath; upper mandible bent down at the tip; nostrils small at the base of the bill, and nearly covered with feathers; tongue jagged at the tip; tail long and wedged.\n\nCape coly.—Outermost tail feathers white on the outside; body cinereous; whitish beneath. Ten inches and a quarter long. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nPanayan coly.—Above yellowish ash colour; beneath rufous; breast streaked with black; head crested; bill black; legs pale flesh colour; tail very long, the feathers of which are of different lengths. Native of Panay, one of the Philippine islands.\n\nGreen coly.—Shining green; hind head and eyelids silvery black; wings and tail blackish. Twelve inches long. Inhabits New Holland.\n\nIndian coly.—Cinereous above; rufous beneath; hind head and chin yellow; lores and naked orbits yellow. Fourteen inches long. Inhabits India.\n\nGen.\nGen. 81. LOXIA, Grosbeak.\n\nBill strong, thick, convex, and rounded at the base; lower mandible bent in at the edge; nostrils small, round at the base of the bill; tongue truncated.\n\nCrosbill, or field apple.—Mandibles crossing each other; body varying in colour; wings and forked tail brown; varies, with a reddish head and flecklet body. Male red, varied with brown and green. Female olive green, mixed with brown. Weighs about an ounce and a half; length near six inches and a half. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Is not known to breed with us, but is more or less found among fir plantations from June to the latter end of the year, feeding on the feed by dexterously dividing the scales of the cones, for which purpose the bill is admirably adapted. It is sometimes found in orchards in autumn, and will readily divide an apple to get at the kernels. Many are taken with a bird-call and birdlime; and others by a horsehair noose fixed to a long fishing rod; for no intent are these birds on picking out the seeds of the cone, that they will suffer themselves to be taken by the noose being put over their head. The crosbill breeds in the northern countries early in the month of March, on the tops of the pine trees, making its hemispherical nest of twigs, and of the Sphagnum arboreum, two inches and a half thick, lining it with the lichen floridus, and stopping up the chinks with rosin. It is capable of being tamed, and in confinement climbs up the wires of a cage by the claws and beak.\n\nGrosbeak, or hawfinch.—Cheesnut ash; wings with a white line; middle quill feathers rhombic at the tips; tail feathers black at the base of the thinner web; orbits and chin black; tail spotted with white within. The length of this species is six inches; weight about two ounces. The plumage is subject to great variety. It inhabits Europe, and usually appears in Britain in the autumn, continuing till April, and appearing in small flocks of four or five, but not commonly. It is more plentiful in France, and breeds in Burgundy in April. The nest is composed of dried fibres intermixed with liver wort, and lined with finer materials. The eggs are of a bluish green spotted with olive brown, with a few irregular black markings. This bird lives on the kernel of the almond, walnut, and cherry, breaking with the greatest ease their hard stones with its bill.\n\nPine grosbeak.—Wings with a double white line; tail feathers all black; head, neck, breast, and rump in the young bird, red; in the 'old yellow; female olive. Nine inches long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America, but is limited to the northern regions of these quarters of the globe, and especially to the pine forests. In this island it is only found in the north of Scotland, where it is also supposed to breed. It sings excellently, and during the night, but soon ceases. It builds in trees pretty near the ground a nest of small sticks, and lines it with feathers, laying four eggs. Its food is the seed of the pine.\n\nBullfinch.—Cinerous; head, wings, and tail black; coverts of the tail, and hindermost quill feathers white; crown black; breast cinereous; belly of the male red, of the female cheesnut. Scarcely six inches long, and liable to vary in its markings. Inhabits Europe and Siberia.\n\nIn summer it frequents woods, and in winter haunts orchards and gardens, where it preys on the young buds of the trees. It is not gregarious, but is usually observed in pairs, or in broods, and remains with us all the year, making a nest of small dry twigs, lined with fibrous roots in some thick bush, either in woods or hedges about the latter end of April or beginning of May, and laying four or five eggs of a bluish-white, speckled and streaked with purple, and rather larger than those of a linnet. The native notes of the bullfinch are few, but remarkably soft, and uttered in low a tone as to escape a common observer; the call notes are simple, but more audible. In confinement it becomes very docile, and may be taught a great variety of tunes, and even to imitate human speech. But it also acquires harsh strains with equal facility. A friend of the Comte de Buffon saw one of this species that had never heard any person whistle but carters; and it whistled with their strength and coarseness. These birds are also susceptible of strong and durable attachments. Some have been known, after escaping and living a whole year in the woods, to recognize the voice of their mistress, and return to forsake her no more; and others have died of melancholy on being removed from the first object of their attachment.\n\nCardinal grosbeak.—Crested; red; frontlet black; bill and legs blood red; crest, when erect, pointed. Nearly eight inches long. Inhabits North America. From the melody of its song, some of the Americans call it nightingale. In spring, and during great part of summer, it sits on the tops of the highest trees, and makes the forests echo with its song. During summer, it lays up its winter provision of maize and buck-wheat. Nearly a bushel of the former grain has been found in the retreat of one of these birds, artfully covered with leaves and small branches of trees, and only a small hole left at which the bird enters. In cages it will sing with a very short interval of silence, through the whole year.\n\nMolucca grosbeak.—Colour brownish; the head, throat, and tail feathers are black; beneath waved white and black; bill black; hindhead, wings and legs brown; rump waved white and black. Four inches long. Inhabits the Molucca islands.\n\nHamburg grosbeak.—Head and neck chestnut above; hindneck, band in the middle of the white throat and rounded tail brown; back, breast, and rump yellowish-brown, spotted with black; belly, vent, and two bands on the wing-coverts white. Nearly six inches long. Inhabits the neighbourhood of Hamburg. Feeds on insects, and climbs trees like the creeper.\n\nGreenfinch, or green grosbeak; provincially green linnet.—Yellowish-green; primary quill feathers edged with yellow; four lateral tail feathers pale yellow at the base; bill brownish; legs flesh coloured; female browner. Rather larger than the house sparrow; weight nearly eight drams; length six inches and a half. Inhabits Europe and Kamtchatka; is very common in most parts of this country in summer; becomes gregarious in winter, and associates with chaffinches and yellow hammer; but in severe weather migrates from particular districts. It is rather a late breeder. The nest is composed of small dry twigs, bents, and moss, interwoven with wool, and lined with hair and feathers. It is commonly placed among ivy surrounding a tree, or in some\nsome thick bush. The eggs are four or five; white, speckled with rusty red at the larger end, and much like those of the linnet, but larger. The principal food of this bird is seed and grain. It is easily tamed if held on one's fingers in the dark, and heated gently. Though its native song is trifling, in confinement it will catch the notes of other birds.\n\n**Brinifone grosbeak.**—Olive brown; throat and belly pale yellow; eyebrows yellow. Nearly six inches long. Inhabits in flocks near the Cape of Good Hope, frequents the banks of rivers, and builds a pendulous nest, with a long neck beneath, in trees and shrubs.\n\n**Bengal grosbeak.**—Gray; crown yellow; temples whitish; belly whitish, spotted with brown. \"This bird (says Sir William Jones) is exceedingly common in Hindustan: he is affonishingly sensible, faithful and docile; never voluntarily deserting the place where his young are hatched, but not averse, like most other birds, to the society of mankind, and easily taught to perch on the hand of his master. In a state of nature he generally builds his nest on the highest tree that he can find, especially on the palmrya, or on the Indian fig tree, and he prefers that which happens to overhang a well or a rivulet; he makes it of grass, which he weaves like cloth, and shapes like a large bottle, suspending it firmly on the branches; but so as to rock with the wind, and placing it with its entrance downward to secure it from birds of prey. Its nest usually consists of two or three chambers; and it is popularly believed that he lights them with fire flies, which he is said to catch alive at night, and confine with moist clay or with cow-dung. That such flies are often found in his nest, where pieces of cow dung are also struck, is indubitable; but as their light could be of little use to him, it seems probable that he only feeds on them. He may be taught with ease to fetch a piece of paper, or any small thing that his master points out to him. It is an attested fact, that if a ring be dropped into a deep well, and a signal given to him, he will fly down with amazing celerity, catch the ring before it touches the water, and bring it up to his master with apparent exultation; and it is confidently asserted, that if a house or any other place be shown to him once or twice, he will carry a note thither immediately on a proper signal being made. One instance of his docility I can myself mention with confidence, having often been an eye witness of it. The young Hindoo women at Benares, and in other places, wear very thin plates of gold called teas, tightly fixed, by way of ornament, between their eyebrows; and when they pass through the streets, it is not uncommon for the youthful libertines who amuse themselves with training these birds, to give them a signal which they understand, and send them to pluck the pieces of gold from the foreheads of their mistresses, which they bring in triumph to their lovers.\"\n\n**Brown checked grosbeak.**—Dirty greenish; cinereous beneath; cheeks brown, surrounded with a yellow fringe. Inhabits Mexico, and sings delightfully.\n\n**Philippine grosbeak.**—Brown; yellowish-white beneath; crown and breast pale yellow; chin brown. Inhabits the Philippine islands. A variety found in Abyssinia, has the tail and quill feathers greenish brown, and edged with yellow. Constructs a nest like the bengal.\n\n**Abyssinian grosbeak.**—Yellowish; crown, temples, throat and breast black; shoulders blackish; quill and tail feathers brown, and edged with yellow; irises red; wing-coverts brown, edged with gray; legs reddish-gray. Size of the hawfinch. Inhabits Abyssinia. This bird forms a curious nest of a pyramidal shape, which is suspended from the ends of branches like the nests of some others of this tribe. The opening is on one side, facing the east; the cavity is separated in the middle by a partition of half its height; up this the bird ascends perpendicularly, and then descending on the other side, forms its nest in the further chamber. By this means the brood is defended from snakes, squirrels, monkeys, and other mischievous animals, besides being secured from the rains, which in that country last sometimes for five or six months together.\n\n**Penfia grosbeak.**—Green; head and throat yellow; ocular band green; belly gray; vent rufous red; bill, legs, tail and quill feathers black; the last edged with green. Size of a house sparrow. Inhabits Madagascar. Constructs a hanging nest of straw and reeds, shaped like a bag with an opening beneath, on one side of which is the true nest. The bird does not choose a new situation every year, but fastens a new nest to the end of the last, so that five may sometimes be seen hanging from one another. Builds in large societies, and produces three at each incubation.\n\n**Sociable grosbeak.**—Rufous brown; yellowish beneath; forehead black; tail short; bill black; region of the ears yellowish; legs brown. Inhabits the interior parts of the Cape of Good Hope, where they were first discovered by Mr Pateron. They build their nests in a species of mimosa, which grows to an uncommon size; and which, from its ample head and strong wide spreading branches, is well calculated to admit and support their dwellings. The tallness and smoothness of its trunk are also a perfect defence against the invasions of the serpent and monkey tribes. In one tree described by Mr Pateron, there could not be fewer than from eight hundred to a thousand nests under one general roof. Mr Pateron calls it a roof, because it resembles that of a thatched house, and projects over the entrance of the nest below in a very singular manner. \"The industry of these birds (says this traveller) seems almost equal to that of the bee. Throughout the day they seem to be busily employed in carrying a fine species of grass, which is the principal material they use for the purpose of erecting this extraordinary work, as well as for additions and repairs. Though my short stay in the country was not sufficient to satisfy me by ocular proof, that they added to their nest as they annually increased in numbers; still, from the many trees which I have seen borne down by the weight, and others which I have observed with their boughs completely covered over, it would appear that this is really the case. When the tree, which is the support of this aerial city, is obliged to give way to the increase of weight, it is obvious that they are no longer protected, and are under the necessity of building in other trees. One of these deserted nests I had the curiosity to break down, to inform myself of the internal structure of it, and found it equally ingenious with that of the external. There are many entrances, each of which forms a regular street with nests on both sides, at about two inches distance from each other. The grass with which they build is called the Boorman's grass; and I believe the seed of it to be...\ntheir principal food; though, on examining their nests, I found the wings and legs of different insects. From every appearance, the nest which I dissected had been inhabited for many years; and some parts of it were much more complete than others. This, therefore, I conceive to amount nearly to a proof, that the animals added to it at different times, as they found necessary from the increase of the family, or rather of the nation or community.\"\n\nGrenadier grosbeak.—Gray; bill, front and belly black; neck and rump tawny; sometimes the wings are white, and the tail is brown. Size of a sparrow; inhabits Africa, and is found chiefly in marshy and reedy grounds. The nest is formed among the reeds with small twigs, so closely interwoven with cotton, as not to be penetrated by any weather. It is also divided into two compartments, of which the upper is for the male, and the lower for the female and the young.\n\nAmong various other species which we have not room to describe, there are two or three of a very small size, which inhabit Surinam.\n\nGen. 82. Emberiza, Bunting.\n\nCharacters. Bill conical; mandibles receding from each other from the base downwards, the lower with the sides contracted, the upper with a hard knob within.\n\nNiculae.\n\nSnow bunting, snow bird, or snow flake.—Quill feathers white, the primaries black on the outer edge; tail feathers black, the three lateral ones white; bill and legs brown. Besides the varieties induced by age, sex, and climate, there are others which seem to be more permanent. In winter, the whole body, except the back and middle coverts, often becomes nearly white. Somewhat larger than the chaffinch. In summer, inhabits in vast flocks, the north of Europe, Asia, and America. In winter, migrates to some warmer climate. Breeds in some of the mountains of Scotland, where it is sometimes mistaken for the ortolan. It builds in the fissures of rocks, constructing a nest of grass and feathers, lined with the hair and wool of the arctic fox or other quadruped, and lays five eggs. It sings well, fitting on the ground, feeds on grain, and is wakeful during the night. It is taken in great numbers in winter, when it is fat, and its flesh esteemed delicate.\n\nTawny bunting.—Quill feathers dusky, white at the base, the last wholly black; tail feathers black, the middle ones at the edge, and three lateral ones white on each side, with a dusky spot without. Nearly seven inches long. Inhabits with the lark; but is more rare. In some places it is called sea-lark and brambling.\n\nMountain bunting, lesser mountain finch or brambling.—Five first quill feathers blackish-brown, the rest white, spotted with brown at the tips; tail feathers brown, three lateral ones all white on each side; bill yellow, tipped with black; head chestnut; chin white; upper part of the neck and back cinereous; breast and belly with longitudinal flame coloured spots. Found in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Northamptonshire, but is not common.\n\nCommon bunting.—Brown; spotted with black beneath; orbits rufous; bill and legs brownish; quill feathers dusky; outer edges pale yellow; tail a little forked, edged with white; legs yellowish. Weight nearly two ounces; length seven inches and a half. Inhabits Europe in large flocks during the autumn and winter.\n\nSeems partial to champaign countries, abounding with corn, and is rarely found in uncultivated parts, or in grass fields remote from arable land. While the female is employed in incubation, the male sits on the branch of a neighbouring tree, and cheers her with his rude song. The nest is placed on the ground, formed externally of straw, lined with fibrous roots or dry grass, and sometimes finished with long hairs. The eggs are from four to six, of a dirty white, spotted and veined with reddish-brown and ash-colour. These birds are sometimes brought to market, and sold for larks, to which they are little or nothing inferior, but are easily distinguished by the form of the bill, and the tooth-like knob in the roof of the mouth, by the most common observer.\n\nOrtolan.—Quill feathers brown, the first three whitish at the edges; tail feathers brown, the two lateral ones black on the outer side; bill, naked eyelids and legs yellowish; head and neck olive-ash; chin yellowish, surrounded with a cinereous line; feathers of the back and scapulars brownish-bay, black in the middle; body reddish beneath. The female is distinguished by the head and neck being cinereous, and each feather with a narrow blackish line. Somewhat less than the yellow hammer; length six inches and a quarter. Inhabits several parts of Europe, but is not found in Britain. Ortolans are common in France, Italy, some parts of Germany, Sweden, &c., migrating in spring and autumn, when they are caught in great quantities, and fattened for the table. For this purpose, they are confined in a dark room, and fed plentifully with oats and millet. They are then killed for sale, and reckoned the most delicate of food. The ortolan will sometimes sing very prettily, its note being not unlike that of the yellow hammer, but finer and sweeter. In some parts, it makes its nest on a low hedge, in others on the ground, and constructs it carelessly, like that of the lark. The female lays four or five grayish eggs, and in general has two broods in the year.—There are five or six varieties.\n\nYellow hammer or yellow bunting.—Tail feathers blackish, the two outer ones on the inner edge, with a pointed white spot; bill black; crown, cheeks and body beneath yellow; eyebrows brownish; nape greenish; feathers of the neck and back blackish down the middle, rufous at the sides, and edged with gray; rump pale tawny; wings chestnut, olive or black, mostly edged with gray; lateral ones olive without; the tip edged with white; legs yellowish-brown. The weight of this species is about seven drams; length six inches. Inhabits Europe, and is one of the most common indigenous birds of this country. Its song is as little attractive as that of the common bunting, consisting only a repetition of the same note, five or six times successively, and terminating in one more lengthened and shrill. It congregates in winter, approaching housetops, and picking up scattered grains. It does not breed till late in the spring. The nest is generally placed near the ground, in some low bush or hedge, and is composed of straw and various dried stalks, lined with fine dry grass, and finished with long hair. The eggs differ somewhat in colour and size, some being nearly white, and others having a purplish hue, but all more or less marked with hair-like streaks. The number is usually three, four, or five.\n\nFoolish bunting or foolish sparrow.—Pedophilus; head Cia. with a few blackish lines; eyebrows white. Size of the yellow\nyellow hammer. Inhabits Europe and Siberia. Is so tame as to be caught in any snare. Has a trilling note, like that of the yellow hammer.\n\nCirl bunting.—Brown; breast spotted; eyebrows pale yellow; two outmost tail feathers, with a white wedged spot; bill brownish; head olive; temples yellow; a black spot between the bill and eyes; throat black, with a yellow band; body yellow beneath; tail slightly forked, the feathers edged with gray. Female streaked with brown beneath; chin and vent white. Length five inches and a half; weight about seven drams. Inhabits France and Italy. \"We first discovered this species,\" says Mr Montague, \"near Kingbridge in the winter of 1800, not uncommon amongst flocks of yellow buntings and chaffinches, and procured several specimens of both sexes, killed in different places six or seven miles from that place. They are indigenous to Devonshire, but seem to be confined to the southern parts of that county contiguous to the coast, having found them extending as far as Teignmouth, at both of which places we found their nests; but have never observed them far inland. It generally builds in furze or some low bush; the nest is composed of dry stalks, roots, and a little moss, and lined with long hair and fibrous roots. The eggs are four or five in number, cinereous white, with irregular long and short curved lines, terminating frequently with a spot at one end; size rather inferior to those of the yellow bunting, to which it bears great resemblance. These birds pair in April, and begin laying early in May.—The female might readily be mistaken for that sex of the yellow bunting at a little distance, but is materially different when compared, especially in the chestnut colour of the upper parts of this bird. The note is also similar to that of the yellow bunting, but shorter, not so shrill, and the latter part not drawn out to such length.—It is remarkable, that so common a bird as the cirl bunting seems to be in the west of England, should have so long escaped the notice of British naturalists; but in all probability this has been occasioned by their locality. It is said to be only found on the continent in the warmer parts of France and Italy; so with us it seems confined to the milder part of England; but the winter of 1800, which was severe in Devonshire, did not force them to seek a warmer climate, but, on the contrary, they continued gregarious with other small birds, feeding their food among the ploughed lands.\"\n\nFamiliar bunting.—Cinereous, spotted with brown; tail feathers tipped with white; hind part of the back yellow. Size of a finch. Was found at Java by Olbreck, and was so familiar, that if the cage door was opened, it would leap on the first person's hand that was offered; if any one whistled to it, it sang very sweetly in return, and if it saw a dish of water, it went immediately and bathed in it. It was fed with rice.\n\nRice bunting or rice bird.—Black; crown reddish; belly black; tail feathers daggered. Six inches and three quarters long. Inhabits Cuba. These birds feed on the early crops of rice in the island of Cuba; but when the rice in Carolina begins to ripen, they quit the island, and proceed to Carolina, in amazing and destructive multitudes. They arrive there in September, while the rice is yet milky; and when it grows hard they return. The birds which thus migrate are all females; but both sexes make a transient visit to Carolina in the spring.\n\nReed bunting or reed sparrow.—Head black; body gray and black; outmost tail feathers with a white wedged spot; bill brown; throat and breast black; belly white, streaked with black at the sides; wing coverts and quill feathers brownish-red, black down the middle; tail feathers pointed, the eight middle ones black, two middle ones rufous on each edge, the rest on the outer only; legs brownish. Weight near five drams and a half; length five inches. Inhabits the marshy and reedy districts of Europe and southern Siberia. A brown variety occur at the Cape of Good Hope, and a white one about Altamira. \"It is somewhat extraordinary,\" observes the intelligent ornithologist quoted above, \"that the manners and habits of so common a bird should remain so long in obscurity; even modern authors tell us it is a long bird, that it sings after sunset; and describe its nest to be suspended over the water fastened between three or four reeds. There can be no doubt, however, that the nest, as well as the song of the hedge warbler, have been taken and confounded for those of this bird; for as they both frequent the same places in the breeding season, that elegant little warbler is pouring forth its varied notes concealed in the thickest part of a bush; while this is conspicuously perched above, whose tune is not deserving the name of song, consisting only of two notes, the first repeated three or four times, the last fling and more shrill. This inharmonious tune it continues to deliver with small intervals from the same sprig, for a great while together when the female is sitting. The nest is most commonly placed on the ground near water; sometimes it builds in a bush some distance from the ground; at other times in high grass, reeds, sedge, or the like, and even in furze at a considerable distance from any water; in all these situations we have met with it, but never fastened or suspended as authors have related. The nest is composed of stalks of grass, or other dry vegetable substances, sometimes partly moss, and lined with fine grass; frequently finished with long hair. The eggs, which are four or five in number, weigh about 36 grams, and are of a dirty bluish-white or purplish-brown, with numerous dark-coloured spots and veins, much resembling those of the chaffinch.\"\n\nWhitewash bunting.—Black; breast red; four middle tail feathers long and pointed, two very long; bill black. The two middle tail feathers are four inches in length, very broad, and ending in a long thread; the two next are 13 inches or more in length, very broad in the middle, narrower at the end, and rather pointed; from the middle of the shaft of this last arises another long thread; the rest of the tail feathers are only two inches and a quarter long; the two middle long ones are placed somewhat vertically, appear undulated across, and are more glossy than the others; the legs are flesh-coloured. The female is wholly of a deep brown, approaching to black, but does not acquire its full plumage till the third year. This species inhabits Africa, particularly Angola. It moults in November, and also late in spring.\n\nShaft-tailed bunting.—Four middle tail feathers black, from nine to ten inches long, equal and feathered only at the tip; bill and legs red; body above, and vent black; body beneath and throat, temples, and orbits, rufous; neck above spotted with black. Native of Africa. Less than the linnet.\n\nGreen-headed bunting.—Brown; head and neck olive; back plate.\nback and wing coverts varied with brown and black; tail forked. Only two instances are recorded of this species having been found in England.\n\n**Gen. 83. Tanagra, Tanager.**\n\n**Characters.** Bill conical, pointed, notched, almost triangular at the base, and a little inclining at the tip.\n\n**Red-breasted tanager.**—Black; front, throat and breast scarlet; bill black; lower mandible filvery, and convex on the hind part; front sometimes black; legs brown. Female purplish-brown; reddish beneath; wings and tail brown. Six inches and a half long. Inhabits South America, frequenting inhabited places, building a pendulous cylindrical nest, and feeding on fruits.\n\n**Bishop tanager.**—Cineraceous; wings and tail blue without. Six inches and a half long. Inhabits Cayenne, especially about the skirts of the forests, and feeds on the lesser kinds of fruits. During night it roosts on the palm leaves.\n\n**Jacamar tanager.**—Black violet; wings whitish beneath; tail divaricated and forked; bill and legs cinereous. Inhabits Brazil and Guiana. Is fond of newly cultivated land; haunts small trees, particularly coffee trees. The male frequently hops upwards from a branch, alighting again first on one foot, and then on the other, accompanying each leap by a note, and spreading out the tail at the same time. The nest is hemispherical, about two inches in diameter, and composed of dried herbs of a gray colour. The eggs are two in number, of a greenish-white, marked with small numerous red spots, deepest and most numerous at the large end.\n\n**Siberian tanager.**—Black; tips of the intercapular and rump feathers fringed with white; bill short, pale, tipped with brown; tail notched at the tip; legs black. Native of Siberia; size of a thrush.\n\nThe other species, which are numerous, and not very distinctly ascertained by authors, seem to differ from one another more in their markings than their habits.\n\n**Gen. 84. Fringilla, Finch.**\n\n**Bill conical, straight, and pointed.**\n\nThis is a numerous and active tribe of birds, very generally dispersed over the world, and feeding principally on insects and grain.\n\n**Lapland finch.**—Head black; body gray and black; eyebrows white; outmost tail feathers with a white wedged spot. Six inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. Runs along the ground like a lark, and sings on the wing.\n\n**Chaffinch; provincially, beech finch, horse finch, pink, and twunk.**—Limbs black; quill feathers white on both sides, the three first without spots; two of the tail feathers obliquely white; bill white, but in spring and summer bluish, tipped with black; crown, nape, and sides of the neck hoary; temples and throat reddish; belly and vent reddish-white; wing coverts with a white blotch, the greater with a white band besides; quill feathers yellowish at the edge, and white at the base; tail a little forked; legs brown. The female wants the red on the breast and other parts. Rather less than the sparrow. Inhabits Europe and Africa. Continues with us the whole year; but the females migrate from Sweden to Holland in the autumn, leaving their mates behind, and return in the spring. This bird makes a most elegant nest of green moss, curiously fluffed with lichen, intertwined with wool, and lined with feathers and hair. It builds against the side of a tree, particularly in ivy, or in some forked branch of a bush; but particularly in apple trees overgrown with moss and lichen, and, like many other birds, adapts the materials of its nest to the surrounding colour. The eggs are four or five, larger than those of the goldfinch, of a dirty white, tinged with purple, marked with streaks and spots of dark purple. Its notes are few, and scarcely deserve the name of song. Both sexes have a monotonous call-note, which seems to express the word twunk. This species is subject to several varieties.\n\n**Mountain finch, brambling, or bramble.**—Base of the Montifringilla; wings fine yellow beneath; bill yellowish, tipped with black; head, neck, and back black; in the female brown; the feathers edged with reddish-brown; rump, lower part of the breast and belly white; throat and upper part of the breast reddish-tawny; in the female reddish-gray; lesser wing coverts reddish; middle ones reddish-white; greater black, tipped with white; those next the body reddish at the tip; quill feathers black, edged with yellowish; tail a little forked; legs gray. Rather larger than the preceding; length about six inches. Inhabits Europe and Asia, breeding in the northern regions. Is frequently seen in large flocks in the winter, on the coasts of Kent and Sussex, when the weather is severe, when it is sometimes so exhausted as to suffer itself to be taken up. They are also found in the interior parts of the kingdom at that season, flying in company with chaffinches and yellow hammers. In hard winters, they are also frequently seen in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. They are partial to the pine forests in the Highlands, and live on beechnuts and the seeds of other trees. They build in trees a nest formed of hypnums without, and of wool and feathers within, the female laying four or five yellowish spotted eggs. Their flesh is eatable, though sometimes bitter.\n\n**Goldfinch or thistlefinch.**—Quill feathers black; and except the outmost marked with fine yellow in the middle; two outmost tail feathers in the middle, and the rest at the tips white; bill white, tipped with black; forehead scarlet, in the female brown; cheeks, hind head, and belly white; top of the head black; wing coverts black, in the female brown; back, rump, and breast chestnut-brown. This beautiful species, which is subject to great variety, is rather less than the chaffinch, and inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is gregarious in winter, lives to a great age, subsists chiefly on the seeds of the thistle, hemp, and capitated plants; is docile and easily tamed, and sings delightfully, even in confinement. It sometimes builds in hedges, but most commonly in trees, especially those that are evergreen. The nest is neatly constructed of bents, moss, and lichen, woven together with wool, and sometimes lined with wool, or hair covered with thistle down, or the papery of the willow. The eggs are four or five, of a bluish white, with a few small spots, chiefly at the larger end. The goldfinch readily breeds with the canary and other congenerous birds.\n\n**Lepid finch.**—Greenish-brown; band above and beneath the eyes and chin orange; breast black. Only half the size of the canary bird. Inhabits the woods of Cuba, and sings with a weak, but very sweet note.\n\n**Ethiopian finch.**—Deep black; irides rufous. Inhabit...\nhabits the woods of America, feeds on fruits and seeds, is easily tamed, and sings with the feathers of the head erected.\n\n**Calpa finch.**—Reddish-gray; front and chin white; wings and tail black. Inhabits Barbary and Abyssinia, frequents granaries in large flocks, and excels the canary bird in its song.\n\n**Beautiful finch.**—Green above; neck cinereous; breast yellow; frontal, chin, rump, and tail red; belly with curved white spots; bill and legs red; rump and tail chestnut red. Five inches long. Inhabits Africa.\n\n**Canary bird, or canary finch.**—Bill and body straw colour; quill and tail feathers greenish. Is now well known over Europe, into which it was brought from the Canary islands, about the beginning of the 16th century. It is somewhat longer than the siskin, and about five inches and a half in length. With us they are kept in a state of captivity, and partake of all the differences and varieties incident to that condition. Buffon enumerates 29 varieties, and more might probably be added to his list. \"The breeding and rearing of these charming birds,\" says Mr Bevick, \"form an amusement of the most pleasing kind, and afford a variety of scenes highly interesting and gratifying to innocent minds. In the places fitted up and accommodated to the use of the little captives, we are delighted to see the workings of nature exemplified in the choice of their mates, building their nests, hatching and rearing their young, and in the impassioned ardour exhibited by the male, whether he is engaged in afflicting his faithful mate in collecting materials for her nest, in arranging them for her accommodation, in providing food for her offspring, or in chanting his lively and amorous songs during every part of the important business. The canary will breed freely with the siskin and goldfinch, particularly the former; it likewise proves prolific with the linnet, but not so readily, and admits also the chaffinch, yellow bunting, and even the sparrow, though with still more difficulty. In all these instances, excepting the first, the pairing succeeds best when the female canary is introduced to the male of the opposite species. According to Buffon, the siskin is the only bird of which the male and female propagate equally with those of the male or female canaries. Great numbers of these birds are reared in the Tyrol. Four Tyrolese usually brought over to England about 1600 of them annually; and though they carried them on their backs 1000 miles, and paid 20l. for such a number, they were enabled to sell them at five shillings a-piece. It is not generally known, that the song of the canary bird is usually composed of the notes of the tit-lark or of the nightingale. Mr Barrington saw two of the species which were imported from the Canary islands, neither of which had any song; and he was afterwards informed, that a ship brought over a great many of them with the same defect. Most of those from the Tyrol have been educated under parents whose progenitors were instructed by a nightingale. Our English canary birds, however, have more of the tit-lark's than of the nightingale's notes. The canary bird lives chiefly on the seeds of *Phalaris canariensis*, *canabiss*, *myagrum*, *brassica napus*, *avena*, &c.\n\n**Siskin or aberdeene.**—Quill feathers yellow in the middle; the first four without spots; tail feathers yellow at the base, and tipped with black; crown black; body yellowish; greenish above, breast greenish; wings green; throat brown, of the female white; head and back, in the female, greenish-ash, spotted with brown. Four inches and three-fourths long. Inhabits Europe, and is liable to several varieties. Though migratory in most places, it does not seem to observe any regular periods, as it is sometimes seen in large, and at other times in very small numbers. Buffon remarks, that the great flights happen only once in the course of three or four years. It conceals its nest with so much art, that it is extremely difficult to discover it. Kramer informs us, that in the forests bordering on the Danube, thousands of young siskins are frequently found, which have not dropped their first feathers, and yet it is rare to meet with a nest. It is not known to breed in this island; nor is it known whence they come over to us. In some parts it is called the barley bird, from its appearing when that grain is sown. Its song, though not so loud as that of the canary, is pleasing and various. It is docile and familiar in captivity, and will imitate the notes of other birds, even to the chirping of a sparrow. Like the goldfinch, it may easily be taught to draw up its little bucket with water and food. It drinks frequently, and seems fond of throwing water over its feathers. The male breeds freely with the hen canary, and is affiduous in his attention to her, carrying materials for the nest, and arranging them, and, during the time of incubation, regularly supplying her with food.\n\n**Bearded finch.**—Pale yellow; wings green, spotted with black and red; chin bearded. Size of the canary bird. Inhabits the mountains of Chili, except in winter, when it descends into the plains. It is easily tamed, sings charmingly, and imitates the notes of other birds.\n\n**Greater redpole or red-headed linnet.**—Chefnut brown; reddish-white beneath; wings with a longitudinal white band; tail feathers edged with white on each side; bill black; head and neck cinereous; sides yellow; middle of the belly white; tail forked, dusky, both sides edged with white. Head of the female ash-colour, spotted with black; crown and breast without the red; breast dirty yellow with black lines. Subject to considerable variety in the markings. Five inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe and America. These birds fly in flocks during winter, at which time the males have little or none of the red markings, which in the return of spring they put forth. In many parts they haunt the sea shore, and, in the breeding season, often resort to furzy commons. The nest is composed of moss and bents interwoven with wool, and lined with wool and hair. The eggs are four or five, of a bluish-white, with purplish specks and short lines. The redpole sings nearly the whole year, is very familiar, and so easily tamed, as to be cheerful in five minutes after it is taken.\n\n**Common or brown linnet.**—Chefnut brown; whitish beneath; wings with a longitudinal white band; tail feathers edged with white on each side. Though this is usually described as a distinct species, it seems to be only a variety of the preceding.\n\n**Lesser redpole or lesser red-headed linnet.**—Brown, varied with gray; reddish-white beneath; wings with a double white band; crown and breast red; bill and legs brown; back black, the feathers edged with chefnut; sides with narrow dusky lines; quill feathers dusky, edged with dirty white; legs dusky. Female with a saffron spot on the front. Weight about two drams and a half; length\nlength five inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. It is gregarious in winter, when many are taken by the bird-catchers near London, &c., under the name of stone redpole. It breeds in Scotland and the north of England; building in the trunk of the alder a nest of dry sticks and wool, lined with hair and feathers, or willow down. Lays four eggs of a light bluish-green, thickly sprinkled with reddish spots, especially at the larger end.\n\nMountain linnet or twite.—Black, varied with reddish; whitish beneath; feathers of the lower part of the neck black in the middle; wings with a white band; rump red; feathers of the throat and breast black, edged with white; middle quill feathers edged; secondary tipped with white. Rather larger than the greater redpole; length about six inches and a half. Inhabits Europe. Is gregarious, and has much the habits of the other linnets, with which it associates.\n\nScarlet finch.—Bright orange; wings and even tail black; quill feathers orange at the outer edge; the primaries tipped with black; bill brownish; legs black. Four inches and a half long. Inhabits the Sandwich islands.\n\nHouse sparrow.—Quill and tail feathers brown; body gray and black; wings with a single white band; bill black; crown gray; a black spot under each eye; a broad bay mark surrounding the hind part of the head; cheeks white; chin and under side of the neck black, the latter edged with white; lesser wing coverts bright bay; the last row black, tipped with white. The lower mandible of the female white, and a white line beyond each eye. The most remarkable varieties are, 1. white, 2. yellow, clouded with chestnut above, and 3. blackish. Weighs nearly seven drams; length about six inches. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. This well-known species inhabits the dwellings of the rich and the poor, and is rarely seen far from the habitation of man. It lives on seeds and fruits, and often cunningly avoids the snares that are laid for it. In autumn it is often gregarious, but more frequently so in winter. It does not sing, except when tamed, and then the male will imitate the song of a linnet, or other bird within hearing. It makes a nest conformable to the place which it chooses for incubation, whether in a hole of a wall, in thatch, under the tiles of a house, or in the nest of a martin, or other bird; but when it builds in a tree, the nest is of a large size, and covered at the top, composed of hay and straw, lined warmly with feathers and fragments of thread or worsted, bits of cloth, or any refuse material of that sort found about houses. The female lays six eggs of a whitish colour, spotted with dusky and cinnamon, and usually breeds thrice in the year. Mr Smellie relates a pleasing anecdote of the affection of these birds towards their young. \"When I was a boy,\" says he, \"I carried off a nest of young sparrows, about a mile from my place of residence. After the nest was completely removed, and while I was marching home with them in triumph, I perceived, with some degree of astonishment, both parents following me at some distance, and observing my motions in perfect silence. A thought then struck me, that they might follow me home, and feed their young according to their usual manner. When just entering the door, I held up the nest, and made the young utter the cry which is expressive of the desire of food.\" I immediately put the nest and the young in the corner of a wire cage, and placed it on the outside of a window. I chose a situation in the room where I could perceive all that should happen, without being myself seen. The young animals soon cried for food. In a short time both parents, having their bills filled with small caterpillars, came to the cage; and after chatting a little, as we would do with a friend through the lattice of a prison, gave a small worm to each. This parental intercourse continued regularly for some time, till the young were completely fledged, and had acquired a considerable degree of strength. I then took one of the strongest of them, and placed him on the outside of the cage, in order to observe the conduct of the parents after one of their offspring was emancipated. In a few minutes both parents arrived, loaded as usual with food. They no sooner perceived that one of their children had escaped from prison, than they fluttered about, and made a thousand noisy demonstrations of joy both with their wings and their voices. These tumultuous expressions of unexpected happiness at last gave place to a more calm and soothing conversation. By their voices and their movements it was evident that they earnestly entreated him to follow them, and to fly from his present dangerous state. He seemed to be impatient to obey their mandates; but, by his gestures, and the feeble sounds he uttered, he plainly expressed that he was afraid to try an exertion he had never before attempted. They, however, incessantly repeated their solicitations; by flying alternately from the cage to a neighbouring chimney top, they endeavoured to show him how easily the journey was to be accomplished. He at last committed himself to the air, and alighted in safety. Upon his arrival, another scene of clamorous and active joy was exhibited. Next day I repeated the same experiment, by exposing another of the young on the top of the cage. I observed the same conduct with the remainder of the brood, which consisted of four. I need hardly add, that not one either of the parents or children ever afterwards revisited the excrated cage\".—Few birds are more persecuted by the farmers, and, perhaps, more unjustly so, than sparrows; as it has been proved, that they are more useful than noxious. Mr Bradley, in his Treatise on Husbandry and Gardening, shows, that a pair of sparrows, during the time that they have their young to feed, destroy, on an average, every week 3360 caterpillars. He discovered that the two parents carried to the nest 40 caterpillars in an hour. He supposed the sparrows to enter the nest only during 12 hours each day, which would cause a daily consumption of 480 caterpillars. This sum gives 3360 caterpillars exterminated weekly from a garden. But the utility of these birds is not limited to this circumstance alone; for they likewise feed their young with butterflies and other winged insects, each of which, if not destroyed in this manner, would be the parent of hundreds of caterpillars.\n\nTree or mountain sparrow, Hamburgh grobbeck of Montana, Latham, &c.—Quill and tail feathers brown; body gray and black; wings with a double white band; bill, chin, and spot on the ears black; head and nape bay; body above reddish-brown, spotted with black; whitish beneath; wing coverts black, edged with rufous; tail feathers blackish, edged with rufous; legs yellowish.

Inhabits Chili, where it is not uncommon. Has a rough voice, and utters at intervals, the syllable ra, ra, very distinctly. Feeds on vegetables, digging and cutting about their roots, with its bill as with a saw, and thus making great havoc in gardens. Builds in lofty trees, in retired situations.\n\nGen. 86. Muscicapa, Fly-catcher.\n\nBill nearly triangular, notched on each side, bent in at the tip, and beset with bristles at the root; toes in most cases divided to their origin.\n\nThe birds of this genus live on insects, particularly flies. Of 92 species, two only inhabit Britain.\n\nParadise fly-catcher, or pied bird of Paradise.—Crested; head black; body white; tail wedged; two middle feathers very long; head, neck, and chin greenish-black; back, rump, throat, and body white beneath; wing coverts and quill feathers black, edged with white; two middle tail feathers 15 inches long; legs lead-coloured. Eight inches and a quarter long. Of this species there are several varieties. Inhabits Asia and Africa.\n\nFork-tailed fly-catcher.—Tail very long and forked; body black; white beneath. Fourteen inches long. Inhabits Canada and Surinam.\n\nSoft-tailed fly-catcher.—Brown; ferruginous beneath; throat of the male blue; tail long, wedged, with loose webbed feathers. Inhabits New Holland, being found about Sidney and Botany Bay, in marshy places, abounding with long grass and rushes, which afford it a hiding place, and where, like the bearded titmouse, it is supposed to make its nest. When disturbed, its flight is very short; but it runs on the ground with great swiftness. This singular bird, which is but three inches long, is well represented in the fourth volume of the Linnaean Transactions.\n\nDwarf fly-catcher.—Straw-coloured beneath; head and neck rufous, spotted with black; feathers of the back and wing coverts cinereous, edged with greenish; quill feathers black, edged with gray; tail black and short. Hardly three inches long. Inhabits Cayenne.\n\nPurple-throated fly-catcher.—Black; chin and throat with a large purple red spot. Twelve inches long. Inhabits woods in South America, is gregarious, feeds on fruits and insects, and often associates with the toucan.\n\nPied fly-catcher.—Black above; under parts, spot on the front and shield on the wings, white; lateral tail feathers white without; bill and legs black; tail coverts spotted with white. Female brown; white beneath, and wants the frontal spot. About the size of a linnet, and nearly five inches long. There are three or four varieties, and the young birds at first resemble the female. It is local, and by no means plentiful in this island, affecting wild and uncultivated tracts of furze. According to Dr Latham, it builds in some hole of a tree, not very near the ground, making a nest of a few fibres, mixed with moss, and laying six eggs.\n\nChattering fly-catcher.—Green; yellow beneath; belly Viridit. and vent whitish; eyebrows and spot under the eyes whitish; tail brown. Seven inches and three quarters long. Haunts unfrequented places in Carolina; is very shy, and flies with its legs extended.\n\nAzure fly-catcher.—Blue; hind head and breast with a black spot; belly and vent bluish-white; quill and tail feathers dusky-blue. Five inches long. Inhabits the Philippine islands.\n\nFan-tailed fly-catcher.—Olive above, ferruginous beneath; eyebrows, chin, throat, sides of the neck, and lateral tail feathers white; middle tail feathers, head, and collar black. Six inches and a half long. Inhabits New Zealand. Flies with its tail expanded like a fan; and is easily tamed.\n\nBlack fly-catcher.—Totally black; bill, head, and legs dusky black. Inhabits Society islands.\n\nActive fly-catcher.—Olive-brown; whitish beneath; quill and tail feathers black, and edged with olive-brown. Four inches and a half long. Inhabits Cayenne. Is continually hunting after insects, which it picks out from under the bark of trees.\n\nSpotted fly-catcher.—Brownish, whitish beneath; neck longitudinally spotted; vent pale-rufous; bill black, whitish at the base; inside of the mouth yellow; head large, brownish, and spotted with black; back moulte-coloured; wings and tail black; the former edged with white; chin spotted with red; legs black. About the size of the tit-lark; length five inches and a half. Inhabits Europe. This bird visits us in spring, and departs in September. It frequents orchards and groves, and will make its nest on the limb of some fruit-tree nailed against the wall, or in a hole, sometimes in outbuildings, on the end of a beam or rafter, and at other times against the body of a large tree, on the stump of a decayed branch. The nest is formed of bents, mosses, and such materials, interwoven with spiders' webs, and lined with feathers. The female lays four or five eggs, not much unlike those of the redbreast, but rather less, and the rufi-coloured spots more distinct, and not so much confined to the larger end. Its food seems to be entirely winged insects, though it is said to be particularly fond of cherries, probably from the circumstance of its frequenting the cherry tree for the sake of flies that are attracted by the fruit. As soon as the young birds leave the nest, they are led by the old ones to some neighbouring wood or grove where insects abound, and where they may be seen darting in every direction in pursuit of flies, and frequently returning to the same station. The note of this species is a simple weak chirp, not frequently used till after the young are fledged, so that the bird, though not uncommon, is not readily discovered.\n\nDesert fly-catcher.—Body ferruginous and foot; wings and tail blackish; bill yellowish. Inhabits the deserts of Arabia.\nGen. 87. Motacilla.\n\nBill subulated, straight; the mandibles nearly equal; nostrils obovate; tongue lacerated at the end.\n\nMost of this genus feed on insects; a few are gregarious; and on the approach of winter, migrate to warmer climates.\n\nNightingale.—Rufous-ash, white-ash beneath; tail feathers rufous-brown; bracelets cinereous; bill brown; head and back pale mouse-colour, with olive spots; tail red-mouse colour; legs and quill feathers brown-ash, the latter chestnut on the outer edge. About the size of the sky-lark, but of a more slender and elegant form. Weighs six drams; and measures between five and seven inches in length. There is a variety with the body somewhat larger, and another that is entirely white. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. Appears in England sometimes in April, but most commonly not till the beginning of May. The females do not arrive till a week or ten days after the males; so that on the first arrival of these birds none but males are caught, a circumstance which has given rise to the supposition, that the proportion of males exceeds that of females. The nightingale is said to be found as far north as Yorkshire, and certainly not farther west than the eastern borders of Devonshire; it is plentiful both in Somersetshire and Dorsetshire. This bird resides wholly in woods and thickets, and is seldom seen. About the latter end of May it prepares a nest of dry leaves, generally of the oak, and lined with dry grass, usually placed on the ground, among the same materials of which it is composed, so that it is not readily discovered. The eggs are four or five, of an uniform brown colour, and rather larger than those of the hedge-sparrow. As soon as the young are hatched, the song of the nightingale ceases; and it is a mistaken notion that this, or any of the later breeding birds, have a second brood in the same season, except when some accident has befallen the first. The young are not easily reared in confinement. At first they are fed with meal-worms, and afterwards with boiled sheep's heart. The winter residence of this bird is said to be in Asia. The sweetness and variety of its notes have been universally admired, and the more so perhaps, because they are uttered in the silence of night. In a wild state, it does not sing above ten weeks in the year, while those confined in a cage continue their song for nine or ten months. The honourable Daines Barrington once kept a very fine nightingale for three years, during which time he paid particular attention to its song. Its tone was infinitely more mellow than that of any other bird, though at the same time, by a proper exertion, it could be very brilliant. When it sang its song round, in its whole compass, he observed fifteen different beginnings and closes; at the same time that the intermediate notes were commonly varied in their succession with so much judgement as to produce the most pleasing variety. Sometimes it would continue its song twenty seconds without a pause; whenever respiration, however, became necessary, it was taken as skilfully as by an opera singer. Nightingales will also adopt the notes of other birds, may be instructed to sing by turns, with a chorus, and even to articulate words. The London bird-catchers take them by net-traps, baited with meal-worms from the bakers' shops. It is with great difficulty that the old birds are induced to sing, after being taken; for a considerable time they refuse to eat; but by great attention to their treatment, and avoiding every thing that might agitate them, they at length resume their song, and continue it during the greater part of the year.\n\nHang-nest warbler.—Greenish-brown above, tawny Calidris beneath, ocular line, and one beneath black. Size of a robin-red-breast. Inhabits Jamaica, and builds a hanging nest.\n\nHedge-sparrow, or hedge-warbler.—Gray-brown Modulatrix above; wing-coverts tipped with white; breast buffish-ash; bill blackish; cheeks striped with white; feathers of the back and wing-coverts edged with chestnut; wings and tail dusky; rump greenish-brown; chin and breast cinereous; belly whitish; vent yellowish; legs flesh-coloured. Length five inches and three quarters; weight nearly six drams. Inhabits Europe; and is one of the few of the warbler tribe that remains with us the whole year. It has a pleasing plaintive song, which it begins with the new year, if the weather is mild, breeds early, making, in March, a nest composed of green-moss and wool, and lined with hair, which is placed in some low ever-green shrub, thick bush, or cut hedge, and sometimes in faggot piles. The female lays four or five blue eggs. In default of insects and worms, the hedge-sparrow will pick up crumbs of bread, and seems to prefer situations near the habitation of man. The cuckoo frequently makes choice of this bird's nest for the purpose of depositing its egg.\n\nLesser petty-chaps.—Greenish-ash above, yellowish below; limbs brown; eyebrows whitish; upper mandible black, lower bluish; inside of the mouth red; a yellowish line above and beneath the eyes; quill and tail feathers mouse-coloured, and edged with greenish; the shafts black; lower wing-coverts yellow; belly silvery. Weight about two drams; length rather more than four inches and a half; size inferior to that of the yellow wren, which it much resembles in plumage, and with which, and the wood-wren, it has been often confounded. It is the first of the warblers that visits us in the spring, being generally heard on or before the first of April, repeating its song, if so it may be called; for it consists only of two notes, which seem to express the words chip, chop, four or five times successively. It is a busy, restless bird, always active among the trees and bushes, in search of insects. The nest is oval, with a small hole near the top, composed externally of dry leaves and coarse dry grass, and lined with feathers. For the most part, it is placed on, or near the ground, frequently on a ditch-bank, or in a tuft of grass or low bush. The eggs are five or six, white, speckled with purplish-red at the larger end only, with here and there a single speck on the sides. This species is found in almost every part of the country where wood or hedges can shelter it. Its note is heard long after the yellow wren is silent; and it remains with us, not unfrequently, till the latter end of October.\n\nWood-wren.—Olive-green above; throat and cheeks Sylvatica yellow; belly and vent fine silvery; tail feathers brown, and, except the first, green on the outer webs, and white on the inner; bill horn-colour; irides hazel; breast pale-yellow; a yellow line through the eye; tail somewhat forked, and brown; under part of the shoulder bright yellow; legs horn-colour. Weight about two drams.\ndrams and forty grains; length five inches and a quarter. The female is rather larger. This is a migrative species, appearing about the end of April, and departing in September. The females arrive ten days or a fortnight after the males. From its great familiarity to the yellow wren, it has been little noticed as a distinct species, but is far from uncommon in some parts of England. It seems partial to oak and beech woods, where it may be found by its singular note, expressive of the word 'twice,' drawn out to some length, and repeated five or six times in succession, terminating with the same notes, delivered in a hurried manner, and accompanied by a flapping of the wings. The nest, which is oval, with a small hole near the top, is constructed of dry grass, a few dead leaves, and a little moss, and is invariably lined with finer grass and a few long hairs. It is placed on the ground, and contains six white eggs, sprinkled all over with purplish spots.\n\n**Petty-chaps, or greater petty-chaps.**—Gray-brown above, white beneath; eyebrows whitish; quill feathers brown-ash, edged with gray; bill blackish; lateral tail feathers edged with gray-brown; legs brown. Length five inches; weight about five drams. Inhabits Europe; and occurs during summer in Lancashire, and in some of the southern counties of England. It chiefly frequents thick hedges, where it makes a nest composed of goose-grass, and other fibrous plants, firmly put together, with sometimes an addition of a little green moss externally. It usually contains four eggs, about the size of the hedge-pigeon's, of a dirty white, blotched all over with light brown, especially at the larger end, where spots of ash-colour also appear. The song of this species is little inferior to that of the nightingale. Some of the notes are sweetly and softly drawn, others quick, lively, loud, and piercing, reaching the distant ear with pleasing harmony, not unlike the blackbird's whistle, but in a more hurried cadence. It frequently sings after sunset.\n\n**Sedge warbler.**—Cinereous above, white beneath; eyebrows white; bill black; head brown, with dusky streaks; hind part of the neck and back reddish-brown; back spotted with black; tail coverts tawny; wing-coverts dusky, edged with pale brown; tail brown and wedged; legs dusky. Weight about three drams; length five inches and a half. Inhabits fenny situations in Europe. It comes to us about the middle of April, and leaves us again in September. It has a variety of notes, which it utters in a hurried manner, and which partake of those of the sky-lark and swallow, as well as of the chatter of the house-pigeon. It is frequent by the sides of rivers and watery places, where sedges and reeds grow, among which it makes a nest, composed of a little moss, intermixed with dried stalks, and lined with dried grass, and occasionally a few hairs, sometimes fastened between two or three reeds, sometimes placed on a tuft of rushes, and fastened round the bottom of them, and at other times, in a low bush, or on the trunk of a willow. The eggs are five or six, of a light-brown colour, mottled with darker shades of the same. Various authors have erroneously ascribed the song of this warbler to the reed-bunting, which has no notes that deserve the name of song, a mistake which has originated from both species breeding in the same places, and the reed-bunting being conspicuous on the upper branches of a tree, while the little warbler, concealed in the thickest part, is heard aloud. It has been remarked, that if it be silent, a stone thrown into the bush, will make it begin singing instantly, and that it will also sing during a moon-light night.\n\n**White-throat.**—Cinereous above, white beneath; first Sylvia tail feathers longitudinally half-white, the second tipped with white; bill black, white at the base; head brownish-ash; back reddish. Female, with the breast and belly snowy. There is a variety that is reddish-ash above, and reddish-white beneath, with the throat white; the most tail feathers on the upper part of the inner side, and whole of the outer side white. Weight about four drams; length five inches and three quarters. Inhabits Europe, and is very common in our inclosed countries. It arrives about the middle of April, and enlivens our hedges with its song, when it erects the feathers on the crown of the head. The nest is made of goose-grass, lined with fibres, and sometimes a few long hairs, but is of so flimsy a texture that it can afford little warmth to the eggs of young. It is generally placed in some low bush, among nettles or other luxuriant plants. The eggs are four or five, of a greenish-white, and speckled all over with light brown or ash-colour. The white-throat feeds on insects and berries, and frequents our gardens in the summer, for the sake of cherries and currants.\n\n**Lesser white-throat.**—Brown-ash, dirty-white beneath; Sylvia two middle tail feathers shorter and subulated; bill dusky, the base beneath yellowish; irides dusky; crown deeper than the body; legs brown. Scarcely five inches long. Though not so common as the preceding, it occurs in many of the hedges of Gloucestershire and Wiltshire; builds in low shrubs, and has a shrill whistling note.\n\n**Epicurean warbler.**—Brownish, white beneath; breast Ficedula spotted with cinereous. About five inches long. Inhabits Europe. Its flesh is reckoned delicious.\n\n**Darford warbler.**—Cheesnut above, ferruginous beneath; middle of the belly, edge of the quill feathers, iridescent wings, and outside of the most tail feathers white; eyebrows red; bill black, the base beneath white; irides scarlet; tail black, and as long as the body; legs yellow. Inhabits Provence, and rarely England. A pair were shot on a common near Dartford in 1773, and others have since been observed about Falmouth, Wandsworth, &c. As yet the nest and eggs are unknown. It is rather larger than the common wren, and five inches and a half in length. It is a shy bird, concealing itself among the thickest furze, on the least alarm, and creeping from bush to bush. The shortness of the wing and length of tail give it a singular manner of flying, which is in short jerks, with the tail thrown up. Its note is a weak but shrill piping noise, several times repeated.\n\n**Penful warbler.**—Gray, yellow beneath; belly and Penful eyebrows white; lores fringed with yellow; wing-coverts with alternate white and black bands. Nearly five inches long. Inhabits St Domingo, and some of the West India islands, where it feeds chiefly on insects and fruits; and has a very delicate song, which is continued throughout the year. \"The sagacity displayed by this bird (says Mr Bingley), in building and placing its nest is truly remarkable. She does not fix it at the fork of the branches, as is usual with most other birds,\"\nbirds, but suffers it to binders hanging from the netting, which she forms from tree to tree, especially those which fall from branches that hang over the rivers and deep ravines. The nest consists of dry blades of grass, the ribs of leaves, and exceedingly small roots, interwoven with the greatest art; it is fastened on, or rather it is worked into, the pendent strings. It is in fact a small bed rolled into a ball, so thick and compacted as to exclude the rain; and it rocks in the wind without receiving any harm. But the elements are not the only enemies against which this bird has to struggle; with wonderful sagacity it provides for the protection of its nest from other accidents. The opening is not made on the top nor side of the nest, but at the bottom. Nor is the entrance direct. After the bird has made its way into the vestibule, it must pass over a kind of partition, and through another aperture before it descends into the abode of its family. This lodgment is round and soft, being lined with a species of lichen, which grows on the trees, or with the silky down of plants.\n\nWhite, or water-wag-tail; provincially, d/bwa/ber, or wa/lervoman.—Breast black; two lateral tail feathers obliquely half white; bill, hind head, nape, throat, and legs black; front, orbits, sides of the neck, and belly white; body cinereous above; greater quill feathers blackish; secondary, and wing-coverts dusky, and edged with gray; middle tail feathers black, and edged with gray. Female with the crown brown. Weight nearly six drams; length seven inches and a half. This species inhabits almost everywhere; is a very active bird, and continually in motion, running after flies. In this country, as the weather becomes severe, it is apt to haunt marshes that are subject to the flow of the tide. Early in spring they return to their usual summer situation; and from the number which are sometimes seen together at this time attending sheepfolds and newly ploughed fields, we may presume that they are gregarious in their flights. In the breeding season they seem to prefer pasture grounds that are constantly mowed, on which they run unencumbered, and where the insects have not sufficient cover to evade their flight. The nest is found in various places, sometimes on the ground, in a heap of stones, the hole of a wall, or on the top of a pollard tree. It is composed of moss, dried grass, and fibres, put together with wool, and lined with feathers or hair. The eggs are four or five, white, and spotted all over with light brown and ash-colour; weighing about forty grains, and much resembling that of the cuckoo, which bird frequently makes choice of the wagtail's nest, in which to deposit her egg. It sings very prettily early in spring, and frequently gives the alarm on the appearance of a hawk, which it pursues in company with the swallows. The young birds have no black on the throat till the returning spring, and the old ones lose it in winter. In this state they have been erroneously described as a variety.\n\nYellow wagtail.—Breast and belly yellow; two lateral tail feathers obliquely half white; bill and legs black; hind claw very long; body olive above; band through, and one beneath the eyes, black; throat with a few black spots; middle and greater wing-coverts black, edged with yellowish; tail black. Female with whitish eyebrows. Length six inches and a half. Inhabits Europe and Asia. Visits this country in April, and departs in September. It frequents arable land, especially in the more champaign parts, and sometimes uncultivated ground, interspersed with furze. It is also partial to bean fields; and breeds in all such situations, being more negligent of water than the white or gray wagtail. The nest is always placed on the ground, composed of dried stalks and fibres, and lined with hair. The eggs are four or five; not very unlike those of the hedge warbler. Its note is more shrill than that of the white, and less so than that of the gray wagtail.\n\nWheatear.—Back hoary; front, line above the eyes, rump, and base of the tail white; a black band through the eyes; crown, neck, and back reddish-gray; eyebrows, rump, upper tail coverts, and upper half of the tail white; lower half, legs, and quill feathers black, the latter edged with reddish-brown; body yellowish-white beneath. The female wants the line over the eyes. There are, however, several varieties. Weighs about six drams and a half; length near six inches and a half. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa. This bird visits England annually in the middle of March, and leaves it again in September. In some parts they are found in great plenty, and are much esteemed. About Eastbourne in Sussex, they are taken in traps made of horsehair, placed beneath a long turf. Being naturally very timid, the motion even of a cloud, or the appearance of a hawk, will immediately drive them into the traps. These last are first set, every year on St James's day, the 25th of July; soon after which they are caught in astonishing numbers, considering that they are not gregarious, and that more than two or three are scarcely ever seen flying together. The number annually entrained in the district of Eastbourne alone, is said to amount to nearly two thousand dozen. The birds caught are chiefly young ones; and they are invariably found in the greatest number when an easterly wind prevails. They are very fat in autumn, and esteemed a great delicacy, little inferior to the ortolan. They live chiefly on insects and earthworms, frequent open stony places, warrens, downs, &c., and breed in stone walls, old rabbit holes, or under stones, making a large nest of dry grass, rabbit's down, feathers, and horse-hair. The female lays five or six eggs, of a uniform pale-blue colour. The wheatear sings prettily, and not unfrequently on wing, hovering over the female.\n\nWhinchat.—Blackish; eyebrows white; wings with two white spots; chin and breast yellowish; bill and legs black; chin white; tail white; the lower third part blackish; two middle feathers all blackish. Weighs about four drams and a half; length full five inches. Inhabits Europe, and appears in this island about the middle of April, frequenting the same places with the stonechat, and corresponding with it in most of its habits.\n\nStonechat or moor titling.—Gray, pale rufous beneath; throat with a white band; lores black; bill and legs blackish; head and neck nearly black; body above blackish, varied with pale rufous; breast and belly reddish-yellow; vent and rump white; tail feathers black, the two outmost, on the outer edge and tip, pale ferruginous; quill feathers black, edged with ferruginous; those next the body at the base, and wing-coverts, with a white spot. Female varied with blackish and reddish. Weight about five drams; length five inches and a quarter. Inhabits hedges and dry moors in Europe and Siberia. Feeds on insects and worms, and frequently\nPaffres. ly sits on the uppermost sprays, daring at every fly that paffes. The neft is placed on, or very near the ground, at the bottom of a furze bush, or fome fimilar fiation, is compofed of mofs and bent, lined with hair, and fometimes mixed with fmall feathers. The eggs are five, of a blue colour, with fmall rufous spots at the larger end. When the young leave the neft, the old birds are extremely bold and clamorous, and are as artful in enticing any one from their young as they are in concealing their neft. In the early part of the fpring, the flonechat fings very prettily, springing into the air, and fupending itfelf for fome time on wing. But as it breeds fo early, its long is of fhort duration.\n\nBlackcap.—Brick-colour above, cinereous beneath; cap dark-brown; bill brown; crown black, in the female cheanut; body greenifh-above, gray beneath, gradually growing white; temples gray; quill and tail feathers brown-afh, edged with greenifh-afh, the middle ones very fhort; legs lead-colour. Of this species there are at leaft three or four varieties. Length full fix inches. Inhabits Europe. It is a migrative bird, visiting us early in the fpring and retiring in September. It frequents woods and thick hedges, and feems very partial to orchards and gardens, where it delights us with its charming melodious fong, which is very little inferior to that of the nightingale, except in variety of notes. It makes a neft in fome low bush or thurb, compofed of dried stalks, generally of goode-grafs, put together with a little wool, and fometimes a little green mofs on the outside, and lined with fibrous roots, on which are frequently placed a few long hairs. The eggs are four or five, of a pale reddifh-brown, mottled with a deeper colour, and fometimes sprinkled with a few afh-coloured spots. On the firft arrival of this bird it feeds greedily on ivy berries, but forfakes that food as foon as the ver- al fun has roufed the infect tribe.\n\nThorn-tailed warbler.—Cheanut, white beneath; crown spotted with yellow; face and eyebrows yellow; wing-coverts rufous, varied with brown; the greater and quill feathers brown; tail wedged, the feathers daggered. Four inches and a half long. Inhabits Terra del Fuego.\n\nLeaf warbler.—Pale brown, whitish beneath; bill and very short tail yellowifh. Three inches long. Inhabits New Holland.\n\nRed-throat.—Throat black; belly and tail rufous; head and back hoary; front white; bill, cheeks, and legs, black; belly white; rump, breast, and lateral tail feathers rufous; the middle ones brown; wings brown. Female with the crown and back gray-afh; and chin white. Five inches and a quarter long. Inhabits Europe. It is feen in this country only in fpring and fummer. It builds in holes of walls, or even of houfes, or in hollow trees; and lays four or five eggs. It fings prettily, and imitates the notes of other birds. It is lefs than the redbreath, and moves its tail horizontally.\n\nBlue-throated warbler.—Breaf t ferruginous, with a blue band; tail feathers brown, ferruginous towards the tip. Size of the redbreath. Inhabits Europe and Siberia. Sings fweetly, and does not migrate.\n\nSuperb warbler.—Black-blue above, white beneath; feathers of the head long, lax, and turgid; front, cheeks, and lunule on the neck fine blue. Five inches and a half long. Inhabits New Holland.\n\nReed wren.—Olive-brown above, whitish beneath; lores and orbits whitish-brown; band in the middle of the wings tawny-yellow beneath; tail brown, slightly wedged; under part of the toes greenifh-yellow. Upper mandible horn-colour, lower teeth-colour; mouth orange; irides brown; chin white; legs pale-olive. Length scarcely five inches and a half; weight nearly three drams. Has often been confounded with the fedge warbler, to which it is nearly allied in form, fize, and habits; but it may at once be diftinguifhed by the greater broadnefs of the base of the bill, by the want of a light stroke over the eye, and having the upper parts of one plain colour. The neft and eggs are alfo different. The former is compofed of long grafs, and the seed-branches of reeds, and lined with the finer parts of the latter. It is very deep, and is generally faftened by long grafs to feveral reeds, which are drawn together for that purpofe. The eggs are four or five, rather larger than thofe of the fedge-warbler, of a greenifh-white, blotched all over with dark brown. This species inhabits near Uxbridge, in the fens of Lincolnshire, and in many parts of the looth of England and Wales; arriving about the end of April, or beginning of May, and departing again in September.\n\nRedbreath, or robin redbreath.—Gray; throat and breast ferruginous; bill and legs dark; tail feathers terminating in an acute angle; belly white; edges of the quill feathers inclining to yellow. There is a variety with a white chin; wing-coverts varied with white, black, and rufous; quill and tail feathers black, and edged with rufous: and another that is entirely white. This well-known species is a conftant inhabitant of moft parts of the European continent, and appears about our dwellings in winter, when the woods and fields are deftitute of infeds. \"When the cold grows more fevere (says Buffon), and thick snow covers the ground, it approaches our houfes, and taps on the window with its bill, as if to entreat an afylum, which is cheerfully granted; and it repays the favour by the moft amiable familiarity, gathering the crumbs from the table, diftinguifhing affectionately the people of the houfe, and affuming a warble, not indeed fo rich as that of the fpring, but more delicate. This it retains through all the rigours of the fefon; to hail each day the kindnels of its holt, and the fweetnefs of its retreat. There it remains tranquil till the returning fpring awakens new defires, and invites to other pleafures: it now becomes uneafy, and impatient to recover its liberty.\" The redbreath generally builds its neft by the roots of trees, in fome concealed spot near the ground, compofing it of dried leaves mixed with hair and mofs, and lined with feathers. The female lays from five to feven eggs, which are whitifh, and fpotted with rufi-colour, and cinereous. In order the more fucceffully to conceal its neft, we are told, that it covers it with leaves, fuffering only a narrow winding entrance under the heap to be left. This bird feeds principally on infeds and worms: and its delicacy in preparing the latter is somewhat remarkable. It takes a worm by one extremity, in its beak, and beats it on the ground, till the inner part comes away; then taking it in the fame manner by the other end, it cleanfes the outer part, which alone it eats. Besides infeds, it is fond of the seeds of the spindle tree. It is a folitary and quarrelfome species, infomuch that two are never feen on the fame tree.\n\nWren.—Gray; eyebrows white; wings waved with Troglodytes black etc.\nPallidus black and cinereous; bill dark brown; head and body deep reddish-brown above; quill feathers alternately barred with black and red; throat yellowish-white; belly and sides crossed with narrow, dusky, and pale reddish-brown lines; tail with dusky bars; legs brownish. Length nearly four inches and a quarter; weight about two drams and three quarters. Inhabits Europe and Asia. Its nest curiously constructed, and not begun at the bottom, as is the case in most instances, but first traced, as it were, in oval frame-work, and equally fastened in all its parts to a tree, or other support, and afterwards inclosed on the sides and top, a small hole only being left near the latter, for entrance. If the nest is placed under a bank, the top is first begun, and well secured in some small cavity by which the fabric is suspended. The materials are generally adapted to the place; if built against the side of a hayrick, for example, the nest is composed of hay, if against the side of a tree covered with Eichen, it is made of that species of mosses, &c. The lining is invariably feathers. The eggs are seven or eight, and sometimes more, white, and sparingly marked with small reddish spots. The song of the wren is much admired, being, though short, a very pleasing warble, and louder than could be expected from the size of the bird. This it continues throughout the year; and it has been heard to sing, with apparent unconcern, even during a fall of snow. It also sings very late in the evening, though not like the nightingale, after dark. The wren feeds on insects, which it finds in sufficient abundance to support life, even in the severest winters.\n\nGolden-crested wren.—Greenish; secondary quill feathers yellow on the outer edge, and white in the middle; crown orange; bill black; crest orange (of the female yellow), each side edged with black; body yellowish-green above, reddish-white beneath; wing-coverts dark-brown, with two transverse white bars; legs yellow. Inhabits every quarter of the globe. This is the smallest British bird; its weight seldom exceeding eighty grains, and its length three inches and three quarters. It migrates from the Shetland islands in winter, but continues in the Orkneys the whole year. Its song is like that of the common wren, but its voice is weaker. It builds a nest nearly of a round form, with a hole in the side; and lays from six to eight eggs. It erects or depresses the crest at pleasure. Though not uncommon, it often eludes observation, from the smallness of its size. It has also been remarked, that the female, from some cause which has not yet been discovered, is frequently destroyed during the time of incubation; and the nest, with the eggs, left to decay. Mr Montagu communicates the following interesting details relative to a young family of this beautiful species. \"When first I discovered the nest I thought it a favourable opportunity to become acquainted with some of the manners of this minute species, and to endeavour to discover whether the male ever sang by way of instructing the young ones. Accordingly I took the nest when the young were about five days old, placed it in a small basket, and by degrees enticed the old ones to my study window; and after they became familiar with that situation, the basket was placed within the window; then at the opposite side of the room. It is remarkable, that although the female seemed regardless of danger from her affection to her young, yet the male never once ventured within the room; and yet would constantly feed them while they remained at the outside of the window; on the contrary, she would feed them at the table at which I sat, and even when I held the nest in my hand, provided I remained motionless. But on moving my head one day, while she was on the edge of the nest, which I held in my hand, she made a precipitate retreat, mistook the open part of the window, knocked herself against the glass, and laid breathless on the floor for some time. However, recovering a little, she made her escape, and in about an hour after I was agreeably surprized by her return, and would afterwards frequently feed the young while I held the nest in my hand. The male bird constantly attended the female in her flight to and fro, but never ventured beyond the window-frame; nor did he latterly ever appear with food in his bill. He never uttered any note but when the female was out of sight, and then only a small chirp. At first there were ten young in the nest, but probably for want of the male's affluence in providing food two died. The visits of the female were generally repeated in the space of a minute and a half or two minutes, or upon an average, thirty-six times in an hour; and this continued full fifteen hours in a day, which, if equally divided between the eight young ones, each would receive 72 feeds in the day; the whole amounting to 576. From examination of the food, which by accident now and then dropped into the nest, I judged from these weighed that each feed was a quarter of a grain upon a medium; so that each young one was supplied with 18 grains weight in a day; and as the young birds weighed about 77 grains at the time they began to perch, they consumed nearly their weight of food in four days at that time. I could always perceive by the animation of the young brood when the old one was coming; probably some low note indicated her near approach, and in an instant every mouth was open to receive the insect morsel. But there appeared no regularity in the supply given by the parent bird; sometimes the same was fed two or three times successively; and I generally observed that the strongest got most, being able to reach farther, the old one delivering it to the mouth nearest to her, and after each feed the waited a while to see if any missed.\"\n\nYellow wren.—Dusky green above, yellowish-white beneath; wings and tail brown, and edged with green; eyebrows yellow. Four inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe and America. Frequent wooded and inclosed situations, especially where willows abound. Visits us early in April, and soon begins its usual song, which is short, with little variety. Makes an oval nest, with a small opening near the top, composed of moss and dried grass, and lined with feathers, either in the hollow of a ditch, or in a low bush, close to the ground. The eggs are six or seven, white, and spotted with light rust colour. Has often been confounded with the lesser whitethroat, and the wood wren.\n\nTailor warbler, or tailor bird.—Entirely yellow, and suturia. Very small, scarcely exceeding three inches in length. Inhabits India. Its nest is composed of two leaves, the one generally dead, which it fixes, at the end of some branch, to the side of a living one, by sewing both together with little filaments (its bill serving as a needle), in the manner of a pouch or purse, and open at the top. Sometimes, instead of a dead and a living leaf, two living\nGen. 88. Pipra, Manakin.\n\nBill shorter than the head, hard, nearly triangular at the base, and slightly incurved at the tip; nostrils naked; feet greyish; tail short.\n\nCrested or rock manakin.—Crest erect, edged with purple; body saffron; tail coverts truncated.—Size of a small pigeon; from 10 to 12 inches long; is shy, but may be tamed, if taken young; feeds on small wild fruits, and builds in the clefts of the most remote rocks, laying two white eggs. Inhabits the rocky parts of South America.\n\nBlack-capped manakin.—Black above, white beneath; spot on the neck above, and on the wings, white; bill black; legs yellow. Inhabits the woods of Guiana. Is reclusive and gregarious.\n\nLittle manakin.—Grey; head black, speckled with white. Size of a small wren. Inhabits India.\n\nTuneful manakin.—Black above, orange-beneath; front and rump yellow; crown and nape blue; chin and throat black. Four inches long. Inhabits St Domingo. Is very shy, and easily eludes the vigilance of such as attempt to take it. Its note is musical, and forms a complete octave, one note succeeding another.\n\nGen. 89. Parus, Titmouse.\n\nBill very entire, narrow, somewhat compressed, strong, hard, pointed, and covered at the base with bristles; tongue truncated, and bristly at the end; toes divided to the origin, the hind one large and strong.\n\nThis is a numerous and prolific tribe, some of the species laying from 18 to 22 eggs at a time. Most of them feed on seeds, fruits, and insects, and some on flesh. They are particularly fond of the brains of other birds, which they get by cleaving the skulls of such as they find dead. They are restless, bold, cruel to birds less than themselves, and will attack such as are three times their own size. Their note is generally unpleasant.\n\nCrested titmouse.—Head crested; collar black; belly white. Nearly five inches long. Inhabits Europe, chiefly in fir woods. Is solitary, and not easily tamed.\n\nGreat titmouse, or ox-eye.—Head black; temples white; nape yellow; bill, chin, and tail black; back and wings olive; rump blue gray; belly greenish-yellow, divided in the middle by a band of black, extending to the vent; quill feathers dusky, edged partly with blue, partly with white; exterior sides of the outmost tail feathers white, of the others bluish; inner sides dusky; legs lead-coloured. This species weighs about 10 drams; length five inches and three quarters. It inhabits Europe, Asia, and Africa; and is common in many parts of Britain, frequenting gardens and orchards, where it does much mischief by picking off the tender buds of trees. The nest is made of moss, lined with hair, and placed in the hole of a wall, or of a tree. The female sometimes lays eight or ten eggs, but more commonly six, which are white, spotted with rust-colour, and so exactly like those of the nuthatch, as not to be distinguished from them. The common note of the great titmouse is a sort of chatter; but in the spring it attunes a greater variety, a shrill whistle, and a very singular noise, something like the whetting of a saw; but these cease with incubation. A variety was once killed near Faversham in Kent, that had the bill crooked, as in Loxia curvirostra. Its characters were olive brown above, dirty yellowish beneath; head black; temples cinereous, and bill forked.\n\nCreeping titmouse.—Bluish; temples, breast, and back American-yellowish; flanks purplish. Four inches and three quarters long. Inhabits Carolina and Canada. Is constantly running up and down trees in search of insects.\n\nBlue titmouse, or tomtit.—Quill feathers bluish, the primaries white on the outer edge; front white; crown blue; bill blackish; line from the bill to the eyes, and one surrounding the temples black; back yellowish-green; wing-coverts blue; quill feathers black, with dusky edges; tail blue, the middle feathers longer; body whitish-yellow beneath; legs and claws black. Length about four inches and a half; weight three drams. Inhabits Europe. This species would probably be more admired for its beauty, if it was less common. In winter it frequents houses for the sake of plunder, and will devour flesh greedily, whether fresh or putrid. It is also a constant attendant where horse-flesh is kept for hounds, and in the farm-yard, being partial to oats, which it plucks out, and retiring to a neighbouring bush fixes the grain between its claws, and hammers it with the bill, to break the bulk. In summer, it feeds chiefly on insects, in search of which it plucks off a number of young buds from the trees. The nest is always made in some hole, either of a tree or wall, composed of moss, and lined with feathers and hair. The eggs are white, and speckled with rust-colour at the larger end. The female is so tenacious of her nest, that she will often suffer herself to be taken rather than quit it, and will frequently return again after being taken out. It menaces every intruder in a singular manner, hissing like a snake, erecting all its feathers, and uttering a noise like the spitting of a cat, biting, at the same time, feverishly, if handled. It has no song, but utters a shrill note quickly repeated.\n\nColemouse, or cole titmouse.—Head black; back cinereous; hind head and breast white; bill and chin black;\na broad black stripe beneath the eyes, from the bill to the neck; belly-and vent reddish white; wing coverts gray, tipped with white; quill and tail feathers brownish-ash, edged with gray; legs and claws lead-colored.\n\nWeight about two drams and a quarter; length four inches and a quarter. Has frequently been confounded with the palustris; but it is not so plentiful a species; keeps more to woods; seems to live entirely on insects, and has also a different note.\n\nMarib tit-mouse.—Head black; back cinereous; temples white. The markings are, however, very subject to vary; the length is about four inches and a half; and the weight two drams and a half. Inhabits Europe. With the blue species it partakes of flesh, and haunts the oat-ricks. It seems to be partial to low wet ground, where old willow trees abound, in the holes of which it frequently nests.\n\nLong-tailed tit-mouse.—Crown white; tail longer than the body; weighs only two drams, and measures five inches and a quarter in length. This very elegant and singular species is confined chiefly to the woods and thickets of Europe and Siberia, where it makes a curious oval nest of lichens, firmly woven together with wool; and having only a small hole on the side, placed in the fork of some bush or branch of a tree. The female lays from nine to seventeen eggs, which are white, and sparingly marked with small rufous colored spots towards the larger end.\n\nCape tit-mouse.—Gray ash; quill feathers black, edged with white; tail black above; bill and legs black. Inhabits the Cape of Good Hope. Constructs a luxurious nest of the down of a species of acclapias; near the upper end projects a small tube, about an inch in length, with an orifice about three-fourths of an inch in diameter. Immediately under the tube is a small hole in the side, that has no communication with the interior of the nest. In this hole the male sits at night; and thus both male and female are screened from the weather.\n\nBearded tit-mouse.—Rufous; crown hoary; tail longer than the body; head bearded; vent black; bill pale orange; irides yellow; legs black; tail wedged; whiskers composed of long black feathers; three outer tail feathers black at the base, and whitish at the tips; middle of the breast flesh coloured; sides and thighs pale orange; six inches and a quarter long. Inhabits marshy situations in Europe. Though it breeds with us, and continues the whole year, its history is little known; and authors differ not only with respect to the shape and composition of the nest, but even with respect to the place of nidification.\n\nPenduline tit-mouse or remiz.—Head ferruginous; ocular band black; quill and tail feathers brown, and edged on each side with ferruginous; four inches and a half long. Inhabits Europe and Siberia, frequenting watery places for the sake of aquatic insects, on which it feeds. The most curious fact in the history of these birds is the exquisite art displayed in the construction of their nest. They employ the light down found on the buds of the willow, the poplar, and the aspen, on thistles, dandelion, &c. With their bill they entwine this filamentous substance, and form a thick clothe web, almost like cloth. This they fortify externally with fibers and small roots, which penetrate into the texture, and, in some measure, compose the basis of the nest. They line the inside with the same down, but not so\n\nven, that their young may lie soft; they flit it above, Paffres, to confine the warmth, and they suspend it with hemp, nettles, &c. from the cleft of a small plant branch over some stream, that it may rock more gently, affixed by the spring of the branch. In this situation, the brood are well supplied with insects, which constitute their chief food, and are at the same time protected from their enemies. The nest sometimes resembles a bag, and sometimes a short purse. The aperture is made in the side, and is almost always turned towards the water. It is nearly round, and only an inch and a half in diameter, or even less, and is often, though not always, surrounded by a brim. These nests are found in the fens of Bologna, Tuscany, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany. The peasants regard them with superstitious veneration, one of them being usually suspended near the door of each cottage, as a charm against lightning.\n\nLanguedoc tit-mouse.—Rufous gray; crown hoary; Narbonet wings and tail blackish, edged with rufous; primary quill feathers edged with white; four inches long. Inhabits France. Builds a strong pendulous nest on the forked branch of a tree.\n\nAmorous tit-mouse.—Blackish blue; longitudinal spot Amatorius on the middle of the wings, half yellow and rufous; five inches and a half long. Inhabits Northern Asia, and is remarkable for the mutual affection of the sexes.\n\nGen. 90. Hirundo, Swallow.\n\nBill small, weak, curved, subulated, depressed at the Character. base; gape larger than the head; tongue short, broad, cleft; wings long; tail mostly forked.\n\nThe birds of this genus are readily distinguished, not only by their structure, but by their twittering voice, and their manner of life. They fly with great rapidity, seldom walk, and perform all their functions either on the wing or sitting. By means of their wide mouth they easily catch insects (their principal food) in the air, or on the surface of the water. Naturalists have been much divided in their opinions respecting the migration of the swallow tribe. The Hon. Daines Barrington and others have supposed that they do not leave this country, but that they lie concealed and torpid, during winter, under water, in crevices of rocks, holes in sand banks, &c. In confirmation of this opinion they quote instances which appear to be sufficiently well authenticated. But a migration of the greater part of the birds is not to be contradicted, by what seems to be rather the effect of chance than design. Those that have been hatched late, and have not acquired sufficient strength to accompany their companions in their journey, may alone have supplied the above-mentioned instances. Were all to remain, we should undoubtedly be furnished with more numerous and more generally known examples than have hitherto been recorded. The ingenious Mr John Hunter, on dissecting several swallows, observed in them nothing different from other birds in the organs of respiration, and hence inferred, perhaps too hastily, that none of them can remain, for any length of time, under water. That the migration of swallows does, however, really take place, appears to have been fully proved by a variety of well attested facts, most of which have been observed by navigators, who were eye-witnesses of the flights of these birds, and whose ships have sometimes afforded\nA. Three toes before, and one behind.\n\nChimney or common swallow.—Front and chin chestnut; tail feathers, except the two middle ones, with a white spot; bill black; body blackish blue above, whitish beneath; tail very much forked; legs short and blackish; weight between five and six drams; length five inches and a half. Inhabits all the quarters of the world; visits us early in April, if the weather be mild, and retires about the end of September or beginning of October. It is supposed to winter in Senegal, and other warm countries. It has got the name of chimney swallow, from the circumstance of breeding in chimneys. It also nestsles on the beams or rafters of out-houses, and sometimes on rocks. The nest is made of mud, plastered together, and lined with feathers, and is open at top. The eggs are four or five, white, and speckled with rusty red. Its velocity of wing and quickness of flight are truly astonishing, and enable it to pursue its prey with precision and effect. When a fly is taken, a smart snap from the bill is to be heard, not unlike the noise of the flapping of a watch case; but the motion of the mandibles is too quick for the eye. Wonderful is the address with which this bird ascends and descends through the piaffages of a chimney. When hovering over the roof of the funnel, the vibration of its wings acting on the confined air, occasion a rumbling like distant thunder. It is not improbable that the female submits to the inconvenience of having her nest low down in the shaft, in order to secure her offspring from the birds of prey, particularly from owls, which are frequently found to fall down chimneys, probably in their attempts to get at the nestlings. The progressive method by which the young are introduced to their proper habits, deserves to be noted. They first, though not without difficulty, emerge from the shaft, and, for a day or two, are fed on the chimney top; thence they are conducted to the dead leafless bough of some neighbouring tree, where, sitting in a row, they are attended by the parents with great affluency. In a day or two after this they are strong enough to fly, but continue still unable to take their own food; they therefore play about near the place where the females are watching for flies; and, when a mouthful is collected, on a certain signal, the dam and the nestling advance, rising towards each other, and meeting at an angle, the young all the while, uttering a short quick note of gratitude and complacency. As soon as the mother has disengaged herself from the first brood, she immediately commences her operations for a second, which is produced about the middle or latter end of August.\n\nEfculent swallow.—Blackish, whitish beneath; all the tail feathers with a white spot; bill black; tail tip with white; legs brown. Two inches and a quarter in length; in size rather less than the wren. Inhabits China and the islands of the Indian ocean. Many of our readers must have heard of the curious eatable nests of this species. The following is the account given of them by Sir George Staunton. \"In the Cats, a small island near Sumatra, were found two caverns, running horizontally into the side of the rock; and in these were a number of those bird's-nests so much prized by the Chinese epicures. They seem to be composed of fine filaments, cemented together by a transparent viscid matter, not unlike what is left by the foam of the sea upon stones alternately covered by the tide, or those gelatinous animal substances found floating on every coast. The nests adhere to each other, and to the sides of the cavern; mostly in rows, without any break or interruption. The birds that build these nests are small gray swallows, with bellies of a dirty white. They were flying about in considerable numbers; but were so small, and their flight was so quick, that they escaped the shot fired at them. The same sorts of nests are said to be also found in deep caverns at the foot of the highest mountains in the middle of Java, at a distance from the sea; from which source it is thought that the birds derive no materials, either for their food, or the construction of their nests; as it does not appear probable they should fly in search of either, over the intermediate mountains, which are very high, or against the boisterous winds prevailing thereabout. They feed on insects, which they find hovering over stagnated pools between the mountains, and for the catching of which their wide-opening beaks are particularly adapted. They prepare their nests from the best remnants of their food. Their greatest enemy is the kite, who often intercepts them in their passage to and from the caverns, which are generally surrounded with rocks of gray limestone, or white marble. The nests are placed in horizontal rows, at different depths, from 50 to 300 feet. The colour and value of the nests depend on the quantity and quality of the insects caught, and perhaps also on the situation where they are built. Their value is chiefly ascertained by the uniform fineness and delicacy of their texture; those that are white and transparent being most esteemed, and fetching often in China their weight in silver. These nests are a considerable object of traffic among the Javanese, many of whom are employed in it from their infancy. The birds, after having spent nearly two months in preparing their nests, lay each two eggs, which are hatched in about 15 days. When the young birds become fledged, it is thought the proper time to seize upon their nests; which is done regularly three times a-year, and is effected by means of ladders of bamboo and reeds, by which the people descend into the caverns; but when these are very deep, rope ladders are preferred. This operation is attended with much danger, and several perish in the attempt. The inhabitants of the mountains, generally employed in this business, begin always by sacrificing a buffalo; which custom is observed by the Javanese, on the eve of every extraordinary enterprise. They also pronounce some prayers, anoint themselves with sweet-scented oil, and smoke the entrance of the cavern with gum-benjamin. Near some of the caverns a tutelar goddees is worshipped, whose priest burns incense, and lays his protecting hands on every person preparing to descend. A flambeau is carefully prepared at the same time, with a gum which exudes from a tree growing in the vicinity, and which is not easily extinguished by fixed air or subterraneous vapours.\"—The nest of this species generally weighs about half an ounce; and is in shape something like a half lemon. The confectionery of the several layers of component matter approaches to that of infusoria, or of fine gum-dragon. Such of these nests as are perfectly free from dirt, are dissolved in broth, to thicken it, and are said to give it an exquisite flavour; or they are soaked in\nin water to soften them, then pulled in pieces, and, after being mixed with ginfeng, are put into the body of a fowl. The whole is then steamed in a pot, with a sufficient quantity of water, and left on the coals all night. On the following morning it is ready to be eaten.\n\nMartin, martlet, martinet, or house martin.—Bluish-black above, white beneath; tail feathers without spots; bill black; mouth yellow; rump white; legs covered with a short white down. There is a variety that has the quill and tail feathers tipped with white. About five inches and a half, and rather inferior in size to the chimney swallow. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and North America. Visits Britain in spring, rather later than the common swallow, making its first appearance in low, warm situations, and if the weather is fine, beginning to build early in May. It builds a close nest, made of straw and clay, and lined with feathers, with a hole at top for admission, in windows, under the eaves of houses, the projecting ornaments of steeples and churches, &c., and sometimes against rocks or cliffs, contiguous to the sea. The eggs are four or five, and pure white. The manners and habits of this well-known species nearly resemble those of the common swallow.\n\nSand martin, bank martin, or shore bird.—Cinerous; chin and belly white; bill blackish; throat encircled with a mouse-colored ring; legs black, and downy behind. Four inches and three quarters long. Inhabits Europe and America, in which last country it is called ground swallow. In this country it is not so plentiful as the preceding, with which it associates, and which in its manners it much resembles, except that it nests in the banks of rivers or sand pits, and makes a nest of straw and dried fibres, lined with feathers.\n\nPurple swallow.—Entirely violet; tail forked; bill black; legs blackish. Female brown. Seven inches and three quarters long. Inhabits Carolina and Virginia, during summer. Is much valued by the inhabitants for its use in alarming poultry on the approach of birds of prey, which it does not only by shrieking, but attacking them with the greatest fury.\n\nCanada swallow.—Bluish black; beneath and mouth whitish-buff; belly white, clouded with brown; quill and tail feathers blackish, edged with brown; legs and claws dusky. Eight or nine inches long. Native of Hudson's bay.\n\nAmbergris swallow.—Grayish-brown; bill blackish; legs brown. Five inches and a half long. Inhabits Senegal. Smells strongly of ambergris.\n\nRed-headed swallow.—Dusky-black, the feathers edged with white; under part of the body white; head red. Size of the least humming bird. Inhabits India.\n\nBlack swallow.—Entirely black. Six inches long. Inhabits the interior parts of South America, and builds in a deep hole in the ground, with a long entrance.\n\nSwift, black martin, &c.—Blackish; chin white. Weight nearly an ounce; length about eight inches. Inhabits almost everywhere. The swift makes its appearance with us later than any of the other species, being seldom seen till May. It frequents steeples, towers, and other lofty buildings, in the holes of which, or under the tiles of houses and barns, it makes a nest of dried grass, lined with feathers, which it collects on wing, sweeping them off the ground in a dexterous manner. Like the swallow, it laps the water, and at the same time, picks up flies as it skims over the surface. The female lays only two white eggs of an oblong shape, larger than that of the swallow; and while she is fitting, the male is continually flying to and from the spot, making a screeching noise, which is its only note. At night, both fit on the nest, or at least roost in the same hole. In very warm weather, these birds soar to a great height; but in cold or moist weather, fly low in search of flies and other winged insects, which at that time cannot ascend. This species disappears about the middle of August, remaining here no longer than is necessary for its breeding. It is remarkable that it disappears soonest in the best and warmest weather; and that in the very inclement season of 1782, numbers of them were seen in the neighborhood of Edinburgh, so late as the 25th of August, flying about with their usual spirit and vivacity, when the thermometer stood at 36°. It is neither cold, therefore, nor the want of food, which disposes them to quit us so early. They have the privilege of moulting to undergo, which cannot be performed in a state of torpor. Their place of retirement, however, has not been ascertained.\n\nWhite-collared swift.—Blackish-violet; head black; cayenne-collar buff; ocular band and thighs white. Five inches, feet, and one quarter long. Inhabits Cayenne. Builds a long conical nest, with a division in the middle.\n\nGen. 91. Caprimulgus, Goatfucker.\n\nBill slightly curved, very small, fulvulated and depressed at the base; mouth extremely wide, and furnished with characters. The sides with a series of bristles; ears very large; tongue pointed and entire; tail unforked, with 10 feathers; legs short, middle claw with a broad ferrated edge.\n\nThe birds of this family seldom appear in the daytime, except they are disturbed, or in dark cloudy weather, but wander about in the evening, in search of insects. They lay two eggs on the naked ground. The lateral toes are connected to the middle one by a small membrane.\n\nEuropean or nocturnal goatfucker; provincially, night European, or dorhauk, charm or goatsoul, wheelbird, nightjar, &c.; Black, varied with cinereous, brown, ferruginous and white; beneath reddish-white, with brown bands; irides hazel; legs short, fealy, and feathered below the knees. The male is distinguished from the female by a large oval white spot near the end of the three first quill feathers, and another on the outmost tail feathers. Inhabits Europe, Asia, and America. With us this bird is only a summer visitant, appearing about the middle of May, and departing again the latter end of September, or beginning of October. It makes no nest, but lays two eggs on the bare ground, among fern, heath, or long grass, sometimes in woods or furze, but at all times contiguous to woods, in which it chiefly conceals itself by day. The eggs are larger than those of a blackbird, oblong oval, whitish, and elegantly marbled with light brown and ash-color. It generally sits on the ground, but if molested, frequently perches on the limb of a tree, most commonly lengthwise, and not across, as is common with most birds. In the dusk of the evening, it begins its flight in pursuit of the larger insects, particularly Sciarabius melolontha, and Siphonitis, which rise from their earthy abode about that time. It is also fond of the large-bodied moths, and indeed allows few winged\nwinged insects to escape its wide extended gape. It makes a singular noise, like the sound of a large spinning wheel, and which it is observed to utter perched, with the head lowermost; besides which, it utters a sharp squeak, as it flies. It has its name from the ancient, but erroneous belief, that it sucked the teats of goats.\n\nGreat goatfucker.—Blackish, with small brown spots and streaks; area of the eyes yellowish; legs white; middle claw not ferrated. Nearly two feet long. Inhabits Cayenne. The gape of its mouth can readily admit a man's fist.\n\nCrested goatfucker.—Waved with brown, black, and whitish; whitish beneath; neck and breast with dusky bands; crest on the front crest; and fetaceous. Nine inches and a half long. Inhabits New Holland. No account has hitherto been procured of its manners, except that it appears about our settlement at Port Jackson in March.\n\nLeone goatfucker.—Variegated gray; wings spotted with rufous and black; a very long naked-flafted feather on each shoulder. \"This singular species,\" says Dr Latham, \"is about the size of the European one, and not far different from it in the general markings: the length from the bill to the end of the tail is eight inches and a quarter; but the remarkable circumstance belonging to it, is the having a single feather springing out of the middle part of the covert of each wing, full 29 inches in length: this continues as a plain unwebbed shaft for 14 inches and three quarters, having a few filary hairs, on the inside only; from thence it expands into a broad web for the remaining five inches and a quarter of its length. This part is mottled, not unlike the darker part of the rest of the plumage, and crofted with five dusky bars; the web or blade has almost the whole of its breadth on the inner side, being there more than one inch broad, but very narrow on the outer part of the shaft; the legs are small. Inhabits Sierra Leone in Africa; several of them have been brought into England,\" &c.—The same bird is described by Dr Shaw in his Naturalists Miscellany.\n\nWe have purposely reserved for an Appendix, the following description of menura superba, a bird of New South Wales, by Major-general Thomas Davies, F. R. and L. S.\n\n\"Menura.\n\nChar. gen. Rostrum validiusculum, convexo-conicum. Nares ovate in medio rostri. Rectrices elongatæ, pinnum decompositis; intermedie dua longiores angustæ, exteriores ad apicem patulæ, revolutæ. Pedes validi ambulatorii.\n\nMenura Superba.\n\n\"The total length of this singular bird, from the point of the bill to the end of the broad tail feathers, is 43 inches; 25 of which are in the tail alone. The bill rather exceeds an inch in length, is strong, formed much like that of a peacock, and black, with the nostrils, which are long open slits, rather large, placed near the middle of its length; the head, which is somewhat crested at the hind part, neck, shoulders, back, upper tail coverts, and upper surface of the tail feathers, of a dark brownish-black; throat rufous, reaching some way down the middle of the neck; breast, belly, and vent gray; Appendix. the feathers of the latter are long, very soft, and of a silky texture; thighs nearly of the same colour, rather long, and feathered down to the knee; scapulars of a brownish tinge; upper tail coverts and prime quill feathers, which are somewhat curved at the ends, brown black; edges of the quills gray; the legs long and very strong, covered with large scales, especially in front; the feet, which are likewise large, and the nails, are black; the last somewhat crooked, convex above and flat beneath; the hind nail near three quarters of an inch long.\n\n\"The tail consists in the whole of 16 feathers; all of which, except the two upper or middle ones, and the two exterior on each side, have long slender shafts furnished on each side with delicate long filaments, four inches or more in length, placed pretty close towards the rump, but more distant from each other as they approach the extremity, and resemble much those of the greater Paradise bird. The two middle or upper ones are longer than the rest, slender, narrow at the base, growing wider as they approach the ends, which are pointed; webbed on the inner edge all the way, and furnished with some distant hair-like threads near the end on the outer side, of a pale gray colour beneath, and brown black above, as is the rest of the tail. The two exterior feathers on each side are of an extraordinary construction, rather more than an inch wide at the base, and growing wider as they proceed to the ends, where they are full two inches broad and curve outwardly; the curved part is black with a narrow white border; the quills of these feathers are double for two-thirds down from the rump. The general colour of the under sides of these two feathers is of a pearly hue, elegantly marked on the inner web with bright rufous coloured crescent-shaped spots, which, from the extraordinary construction of the parts, appear wonderfully transparent, although at first sight seemingly the darkest; they are also elongated into slender filaments of an inch or more, especially towards the extremities.\n\n\"The figure of the male, which accompanies this description, was taken from a specimen sent from New South Wales as a present to Lady Mary Howe. I have also seen two other specimens in the possession of the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, which I believe have since been deposited in the British Museum.\n\n\"Since I had the honour of communicating to the Linnean Society the foregoing description of the menura, I have been favoured with both male and female of that extraordinary bird from my friend Governor King, by the Buffalo store ship; and I am thereby enabled to lay before the society a description of the different sexes. I find, indeed, that, with a little deviation, the same characters and colours will serve for both of them. The female, however, is somewhat smaller, being in length, from the crown of the head to the end of the tail, only 31 inches. The general plumage of the whole bird is of a dull blackish colour, a little rufous under the chin and throat, and of a brownish cast on the scapulars, as in the male. The plumage of the whole body, from the breast to the vent, and from the shoulders to the rump, is composed of long, slender, thread-like, silky feathers, resembling fringe, of a dull grayish-black; lighter on the breast, belly, and vent. The bill and legs, which are strong and furnished with large scales, as in the cock, are black. From the head to the rump...\"\n14 inches; the tail 18 inches, all of a dull brown black colour above and gray beneath; the two upper tail feathers are sharp-pointed at the ends; the rest are rounded and darker in colour, and shorter by degrees, as they approach the rump, so as to appear cuneated; the two outer feathers are shorter than the rest, but in form like those of the male; brown black above, of a pearly gray beneath; and the crests, which are of a deeper rufous colour, are not so visible nor so large, but more transparent if possible, than those of the cock. They are about an inch and a half broad, and not black or longer at the ends as in the other sex.\n\n\"From these birds being found in the hilly parts of the country, they are called by the inhabitants the mountain pheasant. With respect to their food or manners I have not as yet obtained any particular account. In my specimens, there is a nakedness round the eyes, but whether this is from the feathers having fallen off I know not. I rather think otherwise, and that it may be brightly coloured as in many other birds.\"\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.\n\nPlate CCCXCIII. Accipitres.\n\nFig. 1.

See Botany Index.\n\nOROBIO, Don Balthasar, a celebrated Jew of Spain. He was carefully educated in Judaism by his parents, who were Jews, though they outwardly professed themselves Roman Catholics; abstaining from the practice of their religion in every thing, except only the observation of the fast of expiation, in the month Tifis or September. Orobio studied the scholastic philosophy usual in Spain, and became so skilled in it, that he was made professor of metaphysics in the university of Salamanca. Afterwards, however, applying himself to the study of physic, he practised that art at Seville with success; till, accused of Judaism, he was thrown into the inquisition, and suffered the most dreadful cruelties, in order to force a confession. He himself tells us, that he was put into a dark dungeon, so strict that he could scarce turn himself in it; and suffered to many hardships, that his brain began to be disturbed. He talked to himself often in this way: \"Am I indeed that Don Balthasar Orobio, who walked freely about in Seville, who was entirely at ease, and had the bleatings of a wife and children?\" Sometimes, supposing that his past life was but a dream, and that the dungeon where he then lay was his true birth-place, and which to all appearance would also prove the place of his death. At other times, as he had a very metaphysical head, he first formed arguments of that kind, and then resolved them; performing thus the three different parts of opponent, respondent, and moderator, at the same time. In this whimsical way he amused himself from time to time, and constantly denied that he was a Jew. After having appeared twice or thrice before the inquisitors, he was used as follows: At the bottom of a subterraneous vault, lighted by two or three small torches, he appeared before two persons, one of whom was judge of the inquisition, and the other secretary; who, asking him whether he would confess the truth? protested, that in case of a criminal's denial, the holy office would not be deemed the cause of his death, if he should expire under the torments, but that it must be imputed entirely to his own obstinacy. Then the executioner stript off his clothes, tied his feet and hands with a strong cord, and set him upon a little stool, while he pulled the cord through some iron buckles which were fixed in the wall; then drawing away the stool, he remained hanging by the cord, which the executioner still drew harder and harder, to make him confess, till a surgeon assured the court of examiners, that he could not possibly bear more without expiring. These cords put him to exquisite tortures, by cutting into the flesh, and making the blood burst from under his nails. As there was certainly danger that the cords would tear off his flesh, to prevent the worst, care was taken to gird him with some bands about the breast, which however were drawn so very tight, that he would have run the risk of not being able to breathe, if he had not held his breath in while the executioner put the bands round him; by which device his lungs had room enough to perform their functions. In the feverest extremity of his sufferings, he was told that this was but the beginning of his torments, and that he would better confess before they proceeded to extremities. Orobio added further, that the executioner, being on a small ladder, in order to frighten him, frequently let it fall against the shin-bones of his legs; so that the flames being sharp, created exquisite pain. At last, after three years confinement, finding themselves baffled by his perseverance in denying his religion, they ordered his wounds to be cured, and discharged him. As soon as he had got liberty,\nOrobio liberty, he resolved to quit the Spanish dominions; and, going to France, was made professor of physic at Thou-\nloufe. The theses which he made as candidate for this place were upon putrefaction; and he maintained them with so much metaphysical subtlety, as embarrassed all his competitors. He continued in this city for some time, still outwardly professing popery; but at last, weary of dissembling, he repaired to Amsterdam, where he was circumcised, took the name of Isaac, and pro-\nfessed Judaism; still continuing, however, to practise physic, in which he was much esteemed. Upon the publication of Spinoza's book, he despised a system the fallacies of which he quickly discovered; and when Bredenbourg's answer to it came to his hands, Orobio, being persuaded that the writer in refuting Spinoza, had also admitted some principles which tended to Atheism, took up his pen against them both, and published a piece to that pur-\npose, intitled, Certamen philosophicum adversus J. B. Principia. But the dispute which he held with the cele-\nbrated Philip Limborch against the Christian religion made the greatest noise. Here he exerted the utmost force of his metaphysical genius, and carried himself with great temper. The three papers which he wrote on the occasion were afterwards printed by his antagonist, in an account which he published of the controversy, under the title of Amica Collatio cum Judeo. Orobio died in 1687.\n\nOROBUS, bitter vetch, a genus of plants belong-\ning to the diadelphia class; and in the natural method ranking under the 32nd order, Papilionaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nORODES, a prince of Parthia, who murdered his brother Mithridates, and ascended his throne. He de-\nfeated Crassus the Roman triumvir, and poured melted gold down the throat of his fallen enemy, to reproach him for his avarice and ambition. He followed the interest of Cassius and Brutus at Philippi. It is said, that when Orodus became old and infirm, his 30 children ap-\nplied to him, and disputed in his presence the right to the succession. Phraates, the eldest of them, obtained the crown from his father; and, to hasten him out of the world, he attempted to poison him. The poison had no effect; and Phraates, still determined on his father's death, strangled him with his own hands, about 56 years before the Christian era. Orodus had then reigned about 50 years.\n\nORONOKO, a large river of South America, which rises in Popayan, and enters the Atlantic ocean after a course of 755 leagues, in N. Lat. 9°.

See Botany Index.\n\nORPHAN, a fatherless child or minor; or one that is deprived both of father and mother.\n\nORPHEUS, a celebrated poet and musician of anti-\nquity. His reputation was established as early as the time of the Argonautic expedition, in which he was himself an adventurer; and is said by Apollonius Rhodius not only to have excited the Argonauts to row by the sound of his lyre, but to have vanquished and put to silence the sirens by the superiority of his strains. Yet, notwithstanding the great celebrity he had so long enjoyed, there is a passage in Cicero, which says, that Aristotle, in the third book of his Poetics, which is now lost, doubted if such a person as Orpheus ever existed. But as the work of Cicero, in which this passage occurs, is in dialogue, it is not easy to discover what was his own opinion upon the subject, the words cited being put into the mouth of Caius Cotta. And Cicero, in other parts of his writings, mentions Orpheus as a person of whose existence he had no doubts. There are several ancient authors, among whom is Suidas, who enumerate five persons of the name of Orpheus, and relate some particulars of each. And it is very probable that it has fared with Orpheus as with Hercules, and that writers have attributed to one the actions of many. But, how-\never that may have been, we shall not attempt to col-\nlect all the fables that poets and mythologists have in-\nvented concerning him; they are too well known to need insertion here. We shall, therefore, in speaking of him, make use only of such materials as the best an-\ncient historians, and the most respectable writers among the moderns, have furnished towards his history.\n\nDr Cudworth, in his Intellectual System*, after exa-\nmining and confuting the objections that have been made to the being of an Orpheus, and with his usual learning and abilities clearly establishing his existence, proceeds, in a very ample manner, to speak of the opi-\nnions and writings of our bard, whom he regards not only as the first musician and poet of antiquity, but as a great mythologist, from whom the Greeks derived the Thracian religious rites and mysteries.\n\n\"It is the opinion (says he) of some eminent philo-\nlogers of later times, that there never was any such per-\nson as Orpheus, except in Fairy land; and that his whole history was nothing but a mere romantic allegory, utterly devoid of truth and reality. But there is nothing alleged for this opinion from antiquity, except the one passage of Cicero concerning Aristotle; who seems to have meant no more than this, that there was no such poet as Orpheus anterior to Homer, or that the verses vulgarly called Orphical, were not written by Or-\npheus. However, if it should be granted that Aristotle had denied the existence of such a man, there seems to be no reason why his single testimony should preponde-\nrate against the universal consent of all antiquity; which agrees that Orpheus was the son of Oegar, by birth a Thracian, the father or chief founder of the mythologi-\ncal and allegorical theology amongst the Greeks, and of all their most sacred religious rites and mysteries; who is commonly supposed to have lived before the Trojan war, that is, in the time of the Israelitish judges, or at least to have been senior both to Hesiod and Homer; and to have died a violent death, most affirming that he was torn in pieces by women, because their husbands de-\nfected them in order to follow him. For which reason, in the vision of Herus Pamphilus, in Plato, Orpheus's soul passing into another body, is said to have chosen that of a swan, a reputed musical animal, on account of the great hatred he had conceived for all women, from the death which they had inflicted on him. And the historic truth of Orpheus was not only acknowledged by Plato, but also by Ifocrates, who lived before Ari-\nstotle,\"\nOrpheus, noble, in his oration in praise of Busiris; and confirmed by the grave historian Diodorus Siculus, who says, that Orpheus diligently applied himself to literature, and when he had learned ἐν μυθολογίᾳ, or the mythological part of theology, he travelled into Egypt, where he soon became the greatest proficient among the Greeks in the mysteries of religion, theology, and poetry. Neither was his history of Orpheus contradicted by Origen, when so justly provoked by Celsus, who had preferred him to our Saviour; and, according to Suidas, Orpheus the Thracian was the first inventor of the religious mysteries of the Greeks, and that religion was thence called Θρησκεία, Threkeia, as if a Thracian invention. On account of the great antiquity of Orpheus, there have been numberless fables intermingled with his history; yet there appears no reason that we should disbelieve the existence of such a man.\n\nCudworth is also of opinion, that the poems ascribed to Orpheus were either written by him, or that they were very ancient, and contained his doctrines. He farther argues, that though Orpheus was a polytheist, and affected a multiplicity of gods, he nevertheless acknowledged one supreme unmade deity, as the original of all things; and that the Pythagoreans and Platonists not only had Orpheus in great esteem, being commonly called by them the Theologer, but were also thought in great measure to have owed their theology and philosophy to him, deriving it from his principles and traditions.\n\nThe bishop of Gloucester* speaks no more doubtfully of the existence of Orpheus than of Homer and Hesiod, with whom he ranks him, not only as a poet, but also as a theologian, and founder of religion.\n\nThe family of Orpheus is traced by Sir Isaac Newton for several generations: \"Sefac passing over the Hellespont, conquers Thrace; kills Lycurgus king of that country; and gives his kingdom and one of his singing women to Oeagrus, the son of Tharops, and father of Orpheus; hence Orpheus is said to have had the muse Calliope for his mother.\n\nHe is allowed by most ancient authors to have excelled in poetry and music, particularly the latter; and that to such a degree, that he is represented as taming the most ferocious animals, changing the course of the winds by his melody, and as caulking the trees of the forest to dance in concert with his lyre. This account, though we must suppose it fabulous, yet proves his excellence to have been great before he could have given rise to such fictions. He is said to have early cultivated the lyre, in preference to every other instrument; so that all those who came after him were contented to be his imitators; whereas, according to Plutarch, he adopted no model; for before his time no other music was known, except a few airs for the flute. Music was so closely connected in ancient times with the most sublime sciences, that Orpheus united it not only with philosophy, but with theology and legislation. He abstained from eating animal food; and held eggs in abhorrence as aliment, being persuaded that the egg sufficed before the chicken, and was the principal of all existence: both his knowledge and prejudices, it is probable, were acquired in Egypt, as well as those of Pythagoras many ages after.\n\nWith respect to his abstaining from the flesh of oxen, Gesner supposes it may have proceeded from the veneration shown to that animal so useful in tillage, in the Orphic Eleusinian mysteries instituted in honour of Ceres, the goddess of agriculture. He might have added, that, as those mysteries were instituted in imitation of those established in Egypt in honour of Osiris and Isis, this abstinence from animal food was of the like origin, and a particular compliment to Apis. But Abbé Fagnier, in an ingenious dissertation upon the Orphic Life, gives still more importance to the prohibition; for as Orpheus was the legislator and humanizer of the wild and savage Thracians, who were cannibals, a total abolition of eating human flesh could only be established by obliging his countrymen to abstain from everything that had life.\n\nWith respect to theology, Diodorus Siculus tells us, that his father Oeagrus gave him his first instructions in cultus, lib. religion, imparting to him the mysteries of Bacchus, asiv. cap. 25., they were then practised in Thrace. He became afterwards a disciple of the Idaei Dactyli in Crete, and there acquired new ideas concerning religious ceremonies. But nothing contributed so much to his skill in theological matters, as his journey into Egypt; where being initiated into the mysteries of Isis and Osiris, or of Ceres and Bacchus, he acquired a knowledge concerning initiations, expiations, funeral rites, and other points of religious worship, far superior to any one of his age and country. And being much connected with the descendants of Cadmus, the founder of Thebes in Boeotia, he resolved, in order to honour their origin, to transport into Greece the whole fable of Osiris, and apply it to the family of Cadmus. The credulous people easily received this tale, and were much flattered by the institution of the ceremonies in honour of Osiris. Thus Orpheus, who was held in great veneration at the Grecian Thebes, of which he was become a citizen, admirably adapted this fable, and rendered it respectable, not only by his beautiful verses and manner of fingering them, but by the reputation he had acquired of being profoundly skilled in all religious concerns. Diodorus Siculus also says that he was a most attentive student in all kinds of literature, whether sacred or profane.\n\nAt his return into Greece, according to Pausanias, he was held in the highest veneration by the people, as they imagined he had discovered the secret of expiating crimes, purifying criminals, curing diseases, and appeasing the angry gods. He formed and promulgated an idea of a hell, from the funeral ceremonies of the Egyptians, which was received throughout all Greece. He instituted the mysteries and worship of Hecate among the Eginetans, and that of Ceres at Sparta.\n\nJustin Martyr says, that he introduced among the Greeks near 360 gods; Hesiod and Homer purified his labours, and followed the same clue, agreeing in the like doctrines, having all drank at the same Egyptian fountain.\n\nProphane authors look upon Orpheus as the inventor of that species of magic called evocation of the manes, or raising ghosts: and indeed the hymns which are attributed to him are mostly pieces of incantation, and real conjuration. By all accounts he was an admirable musician: he is said to have received a lyre from Apollo, or according to some from Mercury, upon which he played with such a masterly hand, that even the most rapid rivers ceased to flow, the savage beasts of the forest...\nrest forgot their wildness, and the mountains came to listen to his song. All nature seemed charmed and animated, and the nymphs were his constant companions. Eurydice was the only one who made a deep impression on the melodious musician, and their nuptials were celebrated. Their happiness, however, was but short; for Aristeus became enamoured of her; and as she fled from her pursuer, a serpent that was lurking in the grass bit her foot, and she died of the poisoned wound. Her loss was severely felt by Orpheus, and he resolved to recover her or perish in the attempt. With his lyre in his hand, he entered the infernal regions, and gained an easy admission to the palace of Pluto. The king of hell was charmed with the melody of his strains; and according to the beautiful expressions of the poets, the wheel of Ixion stopped; the stone of Sisyphus stood still; Tantalus forgot his perpetual thirst, and even the furies relented. Pluto and Proserpine were moved with his sorrow, and consented to restore him Eurydice, provided he forbore looking behind him till he had come to the extremest borders of hell. The conditions were gladly accepted, and Orpheus was already in sight of the upper regions of the air, when he forgot his promise, and turned back to look at his long-lost Eurydice.\n\nAll dangers past, at length the lovely bride In safety goes, with her melodious guide; Longing the common light again to share, And draw the vital breath of upper air: He first, and close behind him followed she; For such was Proserpine's severe decree. When strong desires th' impatient youth invade; By little caution, and much love betrayed: A fault which easy pardon might receive, Were lovers judges, or could hell forgive. For near the confines of ethereal light, And longing for the glimm'ring of a sight, Th' unwary lover cast a look behind, Forgetful of the law, nor master of his mind. Straight all his hopes exhale'd in empty smoke; And his long toils were forfeit for a look.\n\nDRYDEN'S Virgil.\n\nHe saw her, but she instantly vanished from his eyes: He attempted to follow her, but he was refused admission; and the only comfort he could find was to soothe his grief at the sound of his musical instrument in groves or on the mountains. He totally separated himself from the society of mankind; and the Thracian women, whom he had offended by his coldness to their amorous passion, or, according to others, by his unnatural gratifications and impure indulgencies, attacked him while they celebrated the orgies of Bacchus; and after they had torn his body to pieces, they threw his head into the Hebrus, which still articulated the words Eurydice! Eurydice! as it was carried down the stream into the Aegean sea. Others think, that, as he attempted to conjure his wife from the dead, which they understand by the story of his going down to hell, he thought he saw her; and when afterwards, on looking back, he missed her, he died of grief. There is certainly some reason for supposing this to be the case; for there were persons and temples publicly appointed for the purpose; and Pantheas really speaks of that temple which was in Thesprotia, and where Orpheus went to call up the ghost of Eurydice. Poets often mention this subject; and instances of it occur in history both sacred and profane. The witch of Endor is well known to those who read the historical part of the Bible. But to particularise instances, whether sacred or profane, would be endless. Some maintain that he was killed by a thunderbolt. He was buried at Pheria in Macedonia, according to Apollodorus. The inhabitants of Dion boasted that his tomb was in their city, and the people of Mount Libethrus in Thrace claimed the same honour; and farther observed that the nightingales which built their nests near his tomb, sang with greater melody than all other birds. Orpheus, as some report, after death received divine honours; the muses gave an honorable burial to his remains, and his lyre became one of the constellations in the heavens.\n\nTzetzes explains the fable of his drawing his wife Eurydice from hell, by his great skill in medicine, with which he prolonged her life, or, in other words, snatched her from the grave. Aesculapius, and other physicians, have been said to have raised from the dead those whom they had recovered from dangerous diseases.\n\nThe bishop of Gloucester, in his learned, ample, and admirable account of the Eleusinian mysteries, says, \"While these mysteries were confined to Egypt their native country, and while the Grecian lawgivers went thither to be initiated, as a kind of designation to their office, the ceremony would be naturally described in terms highly allegorical. This way of speaking was used by Orpheus, Bacchus, and others: and continued even after the mysteries were introduced into Greece, as appears by the fables of Hercules, Castor, Pollux, and Theseus's descent into hell; but the allegory was so circumstantial, as to discover the truth concealed under it. So Orpheus is said to get to hell by the power of his harp:\n\nThreici fretus cithara, fidibusque canoris.\n\nVIRG. En. vii. ver. 119.\n\nThat is, in quality of lawgiver; the harp being the known symbol of his laws, by which he humanized a rude and barbarous people.—Had an old poem, under the name of Orpheus, intitled A descent into Hell, been now extant, it would perhaps have shown us, that no more was meant than Orpheus's initiation.\" See Mysteries.\n\nMany ancient writers, in speaking of his death, relate, that the Thracian women, as hinted at above, enraged at being abandoned by their husbands, who were disciples of Orpheus, concealed themselves in the woods, in order to satiate their vengeance; and notwithstanding they postponed the perpetration of their design some time through fear, at length, by drinking to a degree of intoxication, they so far fortified their courage as to put him to death. And Plutarch affirms us, that the Thracians stigmatized their women, even in his time, for the barbarity of this action.\n\nOur venerable bard is defended by the author of the Divine Legislation, from some imputations to his dilatory advantage in Diogenes Laertius. \"It is true (says he), if uncertain report was to be believed, the mysteries were corrupted very early; for Orpheus himself is said to have abused them. But this was an art the debauched mystics of later times employed to varnish their enormities;\"\nOrpheus; as the detested pederasts of after ages scandalized the blameless Socrates. Besides, the story is so ill laid, that it is detected by the surest records of antiquity; for in consequence of what they said of Orpheus in the mysteries, they pretended he was torn in pieces by the women; whereas it appeared from the inscription on his monument at Dium, in Macedonia, that he was struck dead with lightning, the envied death of the reputed favourites of the gods.\n\nThis monument at Dium, consisting of a marble urn on a pillar, was still to be seen in the time of Pausanias. It is said, however, that his sepulchre was removed from Libethra, upon Mount Olympus, where Orpheus was born, and from whence it was transferred to Dium by the Macedonians, after the ruin of Libethra by a sudden inundation which a dreadful storm had occasioned. This event is very minutely related by Pausanias.\n\nVirgil bestows the first place in his Elysium upon the legislators, and those who brought mankind from a state of nature into society:\n\nMagnanimi heroës, nati melioribus annis.\n\nAt the head of these is Orpheus, the most renowned of the European lawgivers, but better known under the character of a poet: for the first laws being written in measure, to allure men to learn them, and, when learnt, to retain them, the fable would have it, that by the force of harmony Orpheus softened the savage inhabitants of Thrace:\n\nThreiclus longa cum stylo sacerdos\nObloquitur numeris septem, discrimina vocum:\nJamque cadem digitis, jam pecline pulsat eburno.\nÆn. lib. vi. ver. 645.\n\nThe seven strings given by the poet in this passage to the lyre of Orpheus, is a circumstance somewhat historical. The first Mercurean lyre had, at most, but four strings. Others were afterwards added to it by the second Mercury, or Amphion: but, according to several traditions preserved by Greek historians, it was Orpheus who completed the second tetrachord, which extended the scale to a heptachord, or seven sounds implied by the septem discrimina vocum. For the assertion of many writers, that Orpheus added two new strings to the lyre, which before had seven, clashes with the claims of Pythagoras to the invention of the octachord, or addition of the sound proslambanomenos to the heptachord, of which almost all antiquity allows him to have been the inventor. And it is not easy to suppose, that the lyre should have been represented in ancient sculpture with four or five strings only, if it had had nine so early as the time of Orpheus, who flourished long before sculpture was known in Greece. See the article Lyre.\n\nWith respect to the writings of Orpheus, he is mentioned by Pindar as author of the Argonautics, and Herodotus speaks of his Orphics. His hymns, says Pausanias, were very short, and but few in number: the Lycomides, an Athenian family, knew them by heart, and had an exclusive privilege of singing them, and those of their old poets, Musaeus, Onomacritus, Pamphus, and Olen, at the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries; that is, the priesthood was hereditary in this family.\n\nJamblicus tells us, that the poems under the name of Orpheus Orpheus were written in the Doric dialect, but have since been transdialected, or modernized. It was the common opinion in antiquity that they were genuine; but even those who doubted of it, gave them to the earliest Pythagoreans, and some of them to Pythagoras himself, who has frequently been called the follower of Orpheus, and has been supposed to have adopted many of his opinions.\n\nOf the poems that are still subsisting under the name of Orpheus, which were collected and published at Nuremberg 1722, by Andr. Chitt. Elchenbach, and which have been reprinted at Leipzig 1764, under the title of ΟΡΦΕΩΣ ΑΠΑΝΤΑ, several have been attributed to Onomacritus, an Athenian, who flourished under the Pythiastridae, about 500 years before Christ. Their titles are, 1. The Argonautics, an epic poem. 2. Eighty-six hymns; which are so full of incantations and magical evocation, that Daniel Heinsius has called them veram Satanae liturgiam, \"the true liturgy of the devil.\" Pausanias, who made no doubt that the hymns subsisting in his time were composed by Orpheus, tells us, that though less elegant, they had been preferred for religious purposes to those of Homer. 3. De lapidibus, a poem on precious stones. 4. Fragments, collected by Henry Stevens. Orpheus has been called the inventor, or at least the propagator, of many arts and doctrines among the Greeks. 1. The combination of letters, or the art of writing. 2. Music, the lyre, or cithara, of seven strings, adding three to that of Mercury. 3. Hexameter verse. 4. Mysteries and theology. 5. Medicine. 6. Magic and divination. 7. Astrology. Servius upon the fifth Æneid, p. 450, says, Orpheus first instituted the harmony of the spheres. 8. He is said likewise to have been the first who imagined a plurality of worlds, or that the moon and planets were inhabited.\n\nOrpheus, in Ichthyology, the name of a fish caught in the Archipelago. It is of a broad and flat figure, and of a fine purple colour; its eyes are large and prominent, and its teeth serrated; it has only one fin on the back, and the anterior rays of that are prickly, the others soft to the touch; its anus is small, and is said to have no passage for the semen.\n\nThis was the fish called orpheus by the ancients, but the modern Greeks call another fish by that name. It is a species of the sparus, of a flat figure, but very thick, has a small mouth, and is covered with small but very rough scales, which adhere very firmly to the flesh; the tail is not forked; it has fleety lips, and very small teeth; its back and sides are black; its belly white: it has a large black spot at the root of the tail; its head is reddish, and its fins are very elegantly diversified with various colours; it has only one back-fin, and that has the anterior ray prickly, the hinder ones not at all so. It grows sometimes to 20 pounds weight, and is much esteemed among the modern Greeks.\n\nORPIMENT, auripigmentum, in Natural History, a mineral which is composed of sulphur and arsenic, found native in the earth, and constituting one of the ores of arsenic, but sometimes artificially prepared. It is of two kinds, red and yellow. See Arsenic, Mineralogy Index, and Arsenic under Ores, Reduction of.\n\nORPINE. See Sedum, Botany Index.\nORRERY, a curious machine for representing the motions or phases of the heavenly bodies. See ASTRO-\nNOMY, p. 171.\n\nThe reason of its being called an Orrery was this: Mr Rowley, a mathematical instrument maker, having got one from Mr George Graham, the original inventor, to be sent abroad with some of his own instruments, he copied it, and made the first for the earl of Ortery. Sir Richard Steele, who knew nothing of Mr Graham's machines, thinking to do justice to the first encourager, as well as to the inventor of such a curious instrument, called it an Orrery, and gave Mr Rowley the praise due to Mr Graham.\n\nORRERY, Earls of. See BOYLE.\n\nORRICE. See IRIS, BOTANY Index.\n\nORTEGAL, cape, the most northern promontory of Spain, where there is also a castle of the same name. W. Long. 8. 29. N. Lat. 44. 0.\n\nORTELIUS, Abraham, a celebrated geographer, born at Antwerp, in 1527, was well skilled in the languages and the mathematics, and acquired such reputation by his skill in geography, that he was furnished the Ptolemy of his time, Julius Lippus, and most of the great men of the 16th century, were Ortelius's friends. He resided at Oxford in the reign of Edward VI, and came a second time into England in 1577. His Theatrum Orbis was the completest work of the kind that had ever been published, and gained him a reputation equal to his immense labour in compiling it. He also wrote several other excellent geographical works; the principal of which are his Theatrum, and his Synopsis Geographica. The world is likewise obliged to him for the Britonnia, which he persuaded Camden to undertake. He died at Antwerp in 1598.\n\nORTHEZ, a city in the province of Bearn, and before the Revolution, a bishop's see. The cathedral is a wretched edifice, very ancient, built in a barbarous style, and almost in ruins. The remains of the castle of Orthez are very noble, and its situation is fine, on a hill which commands the town and a great extent of country. The people call it Le Chateau de la Reine Jeanne, because that queen resided in it during many years, in preference to the castle of Pau. Some of the apartments, though in ruins, may yet be entered. The princess Blanche, daughter to John king of Arragon and Navarre, was shut up, and died here, in 1464. Her brother being dead, she became heiress to the crown of Navarre; but her father having delivered her into the hands of her younger sister Leonora countess of Foix, she confined the unhappy Blanche in the castle of Orthez, and, after an imprisonment of two years, caused her to be poisoned.\n\nORTHODOX, in church history, an appellation given to those who are found in all the articles of the Christian faith.\n\nORTHOGRAPHIC PROJECTION OF THE SPHERE, that wherein the eye is supposed to be at an infinite distance; so called, because the perpendiculars, from any point of the sphere, will all fall in the common intersection of the sphere with the plane of the projection. See GEOGRAPHY AND PROJECTION.\n\nORTHOGRAPHY, that part of grammar which teaches the nature and affections of letters, and the just method of spelling or writing words, with all the proper and necessary letters, making one of the four greatest divisions or branches of grammar. See GRAMMAR.\n\nORTHOGRAPHY, in Geometry, the art of drawing or delineating the fore-right plan of any object, and of expressing the heights or elevations of each part. It is called Orthography, for its determining things by perpendicular lines falling on the geometrical plane.\n\nORTHOGRAPHY, in Architecture, the elevation of a building.\n\nORTHOGRAPHY, in Perspective, is the fore-right side of any plane, i.e. the side or plane that lies parallel to a straight line, that may be imagined to pass through the outward convex points of the eyes, continued to a convenient length.\n\nORTHOPNOEA, a species or degree of asthma, where there is such a difficulty of respiration that the patient is obliged to sit or stand upright in order to be able to breathe. See MEDICINE Index.\n\nORTIVE, in Astronomy, the same with eastern. The ortive or eastern amplitude, is an arch of the horizon intercepted between the place where a star rises, and the east point of the horizon, or point where the horizon and equator intersect.\n\nORTOLAN. See Emberiza, Ornithology Index.\n\nORTNAU, a county of Germany, in the circle of Swabia, lying along the Rhine, and separating it from Alsace. It is bounded on the south by Breisau, on the north by the margravate of Baden, and on the east by the duchy of Wurtemberg. It contains three imperial towns; namely, Offenburg, Gengenbach, and Zell. It belongs partly to the house of Austria, partly to the bishopric of Spire, and partly to the county of Hanau.\n\nORTYgia, the birthplace of Diana, was a beautiful grove of trees of various kinds, chiefly cypresses, near Ephesus; on the coast, a little up from the sea. This place was filled with shrines and images. The priests of the goddess were eunuchs, and exceedingly respected by the people. A general assembly was held there yearly, and splendid entertainments were provided, and mystic sacrifices solemnized. The Cenchrus, probably a crooked river, ran through it; and above it was the mountain Solmilius, on which, it was fabled, the Curetes stood, and rattled on their shields, to divert the attention of Juno. The improved face of a country is perishable like human beauty. Not only the birthplace of Diana and its sanctity are forgotten, but the grove and buildings which adorned it appear no more; and perhaps, says Dr Chandler, the land has encroached on the sea, and the valley, in which Arvissia is, was once Ortygia. See Ephesus, and Diana, &c.\n\nORVIETO, a town of Italy, in the patrimony of St Peter, with a bishop's see, and a magnificent palace. It is the capital of the province of Orvietano, in the ecclesiastic state, in E. Long. 13. Lat. 43. It is a large thriving town, situated at the confluence of the Tiber and the Chiane, on a steep hill, surrounded on every side with rocks and precipices. To this situation it is owing that it has no springs; but there is a very surprising well cut into the rock, to supply it with fresh water. The mules, which bring up the water on their backs, go down by a staircase of 150 steps, and 60 windows, and come up by another, without meeting. The architect of\nof this singular building was the famous Antonio de San Gallo, employed by Clement VII. At the entrance is this inscription, *Quod natura monumentum incidit, industria adject.* This city, called Herbanum by Pliny, and Urbevetanum by Procopius, is the see of a bishop suffragan of Rome. The cathedral, which is of Gothic architecture, is a handsome building, which was begun in 1250 by Nicola Pisano. The front is adorned with fine statues, among the rest the Virgin Mary and the four Evangelists, with a bas-relief of the last judgment, by the said Nicola Pisano, and others representing some histories of the Old Testament. The other half of the front is a surprising work in mosaic, by Scalzi, expressing the history of the New Testament. In the church there is a very fine organ, and a bas-relief of Raphael da Monte Lupo. Here is also a chapel, which was begun to be painted by E. Angelio, a Dominican, and finished by Luke Signorelli, where you see a very beautiful representation of the last judgment. Orvieto was once a potent and populous city, but is now much upon the decline.\n\n**ORYZA**, rice, a genus of plants belonging to the hexandria class, and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Graminae. See Botany Index.\n\nThere is but one species, namely the sativa, or common rice. This plant is greatly cultivated in most of the eastern countries, where it is the chief support of the inhabitants; and great quantities of it are brought into England and other European countries every year, where it is much esteemed for puddings, &c., it being too tender to be produced in these northern countries without the assistance of artificial heat; but from some seeds which were formerly sent to Carolina there have been great quantities produced, and it is found to succeed as well there as in the east.\n\nThis plant grows upon moist soils, where the ground can be flowed over with water after it is come up. So that whoever would cultivate it in this country should sow the seeds upon a hot-bed; and when the plants are come up, they should be removed into pots filled with light rich earth, and placed in pans of water, which should be plunged into a hot-bed; and, as the water wastes, it must from time to time be renewed again. In July these plants may be set abroad in a warm situation, still preserving the water in the pans, otherwise they will not thrive; and, toward the latter end of August, they will produce their grain, which will ripen tolerably well, provided the autumn proves favourable. The leaves of rice are long, like the reed, and flabby; the flowers blow on the top like barley; but the seed which follows is disposed in clutters, each of which is inclosed in a yellow husk, ending in a spiral thread. The seed is oblong, or rather oval, and white.\n\nRice is the chief commodity and riches of Damietta in Egypt. Dr Hasselquist gives the following description of the manner in which they dress and separate it from the hulls. \"It is pounded by hollow iron pestles of a cylindrical form, lifted up by a wheel worked by oxen. A person fitting between the two pestles, pushes forward the rice when the pestles are rising; another sifts, winnows, and lays it under the pestles. In this manner they continue working it until it is entirely free from chaff and husks. When clean, they add a third part of salt, and pound them together; by which the rice, formerly gray, becomes white. After this purification, it is passed through a fine sieve to part the salt. Oryzivora from the rice; and then it is ready for sale.\" Damietta sells every year 60,800 sacks of rice, the greatest part of which goes to Turkey, some to Deghorn, Marfeilles, and Venice.\n\n**ORYZIVORA**, called the rice-bird of Cateby, a species of emberiza, which see, Ornithology Index.\n\n**OSCHOPHORIA**, a festival celebrated by the Athenians, which receives its name απὸ τοῦ ἐγκεῖν ταῖς στροβάλαις, \"from carrying boughs hung up with grapes,\" called στροβάλαι. The original institution is thus mentioned by Plut. in Theseus, on returning from Crete, forgot to hang out the white sail, by which his father was to be apprised of his success. This neglect proved fatal to Aegeus, for he threw himself into the sea, and perished. Theseus no sooner reached the land, than he sent a herald to inform his father of his safe return, and in the mean time he began to make the sacrifices which he had vowed to make when he first set sail from Crete. The herald, on his entrance into the city, found the people in great agitation. Some lamented the king's death, while others, elated at the sudden news of the victory of Theseus, crowned the herald with garlands in token of their joy. The herald carried back the garlands on his staff to the sea shore; and, after waiting till Theseus had finished his sacrifice, he related the melancholy account of the king's death. Upon this the people ran in crowds to the city, showing their grief by cries and lamentations.—From this circumstance, therefore, at the feast of Oschophoria, not the herald but his staff is crowned with garlands, and all the people that are present always exclaim ἀληθές, ἀληθές, the first of which expresses haste, and the others a consternation or depression of spirits. The historian further mentions, that Theseus, when he went to Crete, did not take with him the usual number of virgins, but that in the place of two of them, he took two youths of his acquaintance, whom he caused to pass for women, by disguising their dress, and by accustoming them to the ointments and perfumes of women, as well as by a long and successful imitation of their voice. The imposition succeeded; their sex was not discovered in Crete; and when Theseus had triumphed over the Minotaur, he with these two young men led a procession, with branches in their hands, in the same habit, which is still used at the celebration of the festival. The branches which were carried were in honour of Bacchus or Ariadne, or because they returned in autumn, when the grapes were ripe. Besides this procession, there was also a race, in which young men only whose parents were both alive were permitted to engage. It was customary for them to run from the temple of Bacchus to that of Minerva, which was on the sea shore. The place where they stopped was called στροβάλαι, because the boughs which they carried in their hands were deposited there. The rewards of the conqueror was a cup called πυριστήρας, \"five-fold,\" because it contained a mixture of five different things, wine, honey, cheese, meal, and oil.\n\n**OSCILLA**, small images of wax or clay made in the shape of men or women, and consecrated to Saturn, to render him propitious. The word is sometimes used to signify a kind of masks scooped from the bark of trees, and worn by the performers of comedy in the rude ages of Rome. In this sense we find it in Virg. Geo. ii. 386. It also signifies little heads or images of Bacchus.\nBacchus, which the country men of old hung upon trees, that the face might turn every way, out of a notion that the countenance of this god gave felicity to themselves, and fertility to their vineyards. An allusion to this opinion and custom is also found in Virgil, Geo. ii. 388.\n\nOSENLEY-ISLAND, in England, is formed by the river Isis, in the meadows near Oxford, where a magnificent abbey was erected, at the instigation of a concubine of King Henry I. to atone for her sins; and the said king built a palace there, wherein King Richard I. was born, which Edward II. converted into a monastery.\n\nOSIRIS, in Mythology, one of the gods of ancient Egypt, and very generally believed to have been the sun, or at least the mind actuating that luminary.\n\nThe Egyptians derived all things from two principles, an active and a passive. Their active principle, according to the learned Jablonski *, was an infinite and eternal spirit; and their passive principle was night. This spirit they considered sometimes as a male, sometimes as a female divinity, and occasionally they attributed it to both sexes; but it does not appear to have been the object of their worship. It shall be shown elsewhere (see Polytheism), that the earliest objects of pagan adoration were the sun, moon, and planets; and that the philosophers and priests of ancient Egypt worshipped the sun by the name of Osiris, may be proved by numberless testimonies from the most authentic records of antiquity. Diogenes Laertius affirms, that they held the sun and moon for divinities, and that they called the latter Isis; and Macrobius says expressly, \"Nec in occulto est, neque aliud illae Osiris quam sollem, nec ilium aliud quam terram.\" The same writer informs us, that in the hieroglyphic writings of ancient Egypt, \"Osiris was represented by a sceptre and an eye,\" to denote that this god was the sun looking down from heaven on all things upon earth.\n\nIt must not, however, be concealed, that some of the most learned moderns, have contended, that by Osiris the Egyptians understood the Nile or spirit of the Nile, whilst others have confounded them with the Grecian Bacchus. Scaliger and Selden have adopted the former of these opinions, and Servius on Virgil has given his countenance to the latter. But that they are all mistaken, has been evinced by Jablonski in such a manner as to enforce the fullest conviction: \"When the Egyptians, in their sacred books, sometimes gave the name of Osiris to the Nile and its wonderful increase during the heat of summer, they mean nothing more (says he) but to attribute to their god Osiris the gift which fertilizes their country.\" This they would the more readily do that they believed the Nile to have its source in heaven. Hence Eusebius tells us, Οσιρίς εἰναι ἡ Νεῖλος, ὥσπερ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πέσῃ αὕτη, Osiris is the Nile, because they think it is sent down from heaven. In one sense Osiris might be Bacchus, because the original Bacchus was himself the sun (see Mysteries, No. 12.); but that the Egyptian god could not be worshipped as the inventor of wine is indeed undeniable, if, as Jablonski labours to prove, the primitive religion of that country inculcated upon its votaries, that wine was the gift, not of a benevolent good, but of an evil genius, the enemy of the human race. In support of this opinion our learned author quotes a passage from Plutarch, from which it appears, that before the era of Plutarchus, the Egyptians neither drank wine themselves nor offered it in libations to the gods, because they believed that the first vine sprung from the earth was impregnated by the blood of those giants who perished in the war with the gods. It is indeed true, that the Greeks, who borrowed their religion as well as the first principles of science from Egypt, attributed to their Bacchus many of the actions of Osiris; but it is likewise true, that they gave him other attributes, which the Egyptian god could not possess consistently with the known superstitions of that country. Salmonius, however, attempts to prove, from the import of the name, that the Osiris of Egypt must have been the Bacchus of Greece. Σοῖς or Σοῖς, he says, signifies a son in the Egyptian language; and hence he concludes, that the god was by that people called Osiris, for the same reason that by the Greeks he was called Κόρης, and by the Romans Liber. But this seems all to be a mistake. Siri makes a part of many Egyptian proper names, as Basi-siri, Terma-siri, Tapo-siri, &c., and is in all probability derived from the Hebrew word Sar, Sir, or Sir, which signifies a prince, potentate, or grandee. As the name of the god was in Egypt not Osiris, but Jiris or Yiris, it was probably made up of Sir or Siri, and the Hebrew prefix I or i, denoting strength; so that the whole word will signify the strong or mighty prince. If so, we cannot doubt, as Diodorus Siculus, Eusebius, Sextus Empiricus, &c., all affirm, that the Egyptians worshipped the sun by the name of Osiris, but that by this name they meant the power or governing mind of the sun, as the Greeks and Romans seem to have done by their Phoebus and Apollo.\n\nBut though the original Osiris was undoubtedly the sun, or the intelligence actuating the sun, yet there is reason to believe that there was a secondary Osiris, who at a very early period reigned in Egypt, and was deified after his death for the benefits he had rendered to his country (see Polytheism). This is indeed so generally admitted, as to have occasioned great controversies among the learned reflecting the time when he flourished, and whether he was the civilizer of rude barbarians or the victorious sovereign of a polished nation. The illustrious Newton, it is well known, has adopted the latter opinion; and with much plausibility endeavoured to prove, that Osiris was the same with Sebostris or Sebset; but it must be confessed, that his conclusion is contrary to all the most authentic records of antiquity; and that it would be easy, by the same mode of arguing, to give a show of identity to two persons universally known to have flourished in very distant ages (A). The annals of Egypt, as may be seen in the writings of Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Plutarch, and others, who co-\n\n---\n\n(A) This has been in fact done by Warburton; who employs Newton's mode of reasoning with equal plausibility, and perhaps superior force, to prove the identity of King Arthur and William the Conqueror. See Divine Legation of Moses, vol. iii. book iv. sect. 5.\npied from those animals, expressly affected the distinct personality of Osiris and Setosiris, and placed them in a vastly distant from each other. Osiris, if any credit be due to those historians, was the founder of the Egyptian monarchy; and, as was customary in those days, having either received the name of the sun, or communicated his own to that luminary, was after his death deified for the benefits which he had rendered to his country: and being at first worshipped only as a demi-god, was in process of time advanced to full divinity, and confounded with his heavenly godfather. The Greeks, who, though original in nothing, were always prompted by their vanity to hold themselves out as the first of the nations, claimed this Osiris as their own, and pretended that he was the son of Jupiter and Niobe. He reigned, say they, over the Argives; but afterwards delivered his kingdom to his brother Algieus, and took a voyage into Egypt, of which he made himself master, and married Io or Isis. He established good laws there; and they were both after their deaths worshipped as gods. That this is a ridiculous fiction needs no proof; since every one knows, that good laws were established in Egypt long before the Argives had any king, or indeed existed either as a tribe or nation.\n\nOSMUNDA, MOONWORT; a genus of plants belonging to the cryptogamia class. See Botany Index.\n\nOsnaburg, a bishopric of Germany, situated in the centre of the circle of Westphalia, between the Weser and the Ems, having Minden on the east, Munster on the west, Diepholtz on the north-east, and Ravensburg on the south-west. It is about 45 miles long and 25 broad, producing some rye, several sorts of turf, coal, marble, and good pastureage. The inhabitants, who are a mixture of Protestants and Roman Catholics, breed a considerable number of cattle, especially hogs, of which they make excellent bacon and hams; but a great part of the country consists of heaths. By the treaty concluded here in 1648, the bishopric was to be an alternative between the Roman Catholics and Lutherans; and the Lutheran bishop was to be a younger prince of the house of Brunswick-Luneburg, or in failure thereof, of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel. In consequence of this settlement, it has been twice held by a British prince since the accession of the family of Hanover. The bishop is able to raise 2,500 men, his revenue being between 22,000 and 32,000l. The chief manufactures of the country are a coarse kind of linen cloth and yarn, which are said to bring into it annually about 1,000,000 of rixdollars. There are also some woollen manufactures in Osnaburg and Bramsche. The land estates of the bishopric are, the chapter, the knights, and the four towns. The diets are held at Osnaburg, when called together by the bishop. The count of Bar is hereditary seneschal or fleward, and president of the college of knights. The bishop is a prince of the empire; and in the matricula is rated at six horse and 36 foot, or 216 florins monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber of the empire he contributes each term 81 rixdollars, 14 kreutzers and a half. The capital of this bishopric is\n\nOsnaburg, or Osnabruck. It was formerly an imperial city, and one of the Hanse towns; but it is now subject to the bishop, though it still enjoys many privileges, and a revenue of about 8,000 or 9,000 rixdollars. It has its name from a bridge over the river Hase, or Ose, which divides it into the Old and New Town, and stands 75 miles west of Hanover, and 30 north east of Munster, being surrounded with walls and ditches, but commanded by a mountain within cannon shot. It stands in a fine plain, and is adorned with several good buildings, and on the mountain there is an abbey. The magistracy of this city, which is re-chosen yearly on the 2d of January, is Lutheran; and the churches belong, some to the Lutherans, and some to the Papists. Both parties have the full and free exercise of their religion, whether the bishop be Protestant or Papist. The bishop's palace, called Petersburgh, was built by Bishop Ernst Augustus, brother to King George I. It is well fortified and separated from the town by a bridge. It is a hexagon with a court in the middle, and at each corner a turret. In the town-house are still preserved the pictures of the plenipotentiaries that attended at the conferences there for the famous treaty of Westphalia. In the treasure of the cathedral are still to be seen some ornaments given by Charlemagne, as also his crown, which is only of silver gilt, and his comb and baton, five feet in length, both of ivory; together with other curiosities. Charlemagne is said to have erected here a school for Latin and Greek, which the Jesuits in 1625 converted into an academy. They have the best bread and beer that is to be met with in all Westphalia, and have a pretty good trade in bacon and linen; as also by brewing a palatable thick sort of beer called bude. This city is noted for a treaty betwixt the emperor and the king of Sweden in 1648, wherein the affairs of the Protestants were regulated, which was a branch of the treaty of Westphalia. The town, with the rest of the principality, is subject to its bishop, who is a count of the empire, and by the treaty of Westphalia must be alternately a Protestant and Papist. The Popish bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Cologne; but the Protestant bishop is invested a temporal prince, and always of the house of Brunswic, in consideration of the principality of Halberstadt, which was taken from this house, and conferred upon the elector of Brandenburg. Frederic duke of York, second son of his majesty George III., is the present bishop. The cathedral is in the hands of the Roman Catholics, with the church and monastery of the Dominicans in the old city, and the collegiate church of St John in the new. The Protestants are masters of the great parochial church of St Mary in the old city; and both religions have a voice in the election of the magistrates. Of 25 canons belonging to the cathedral, 18 are Roman Catholics, and the revenues of 4 more are enjoyed by the Jesuits for the support of their college; so that there are but 3 Protestant canons, who have no voice in the election of the Roman Catholic bishop, when it is his turn to succeed. The bishop's palace is fortified like a castle: here it was that George I. was born on the 28th of May 1660, his father Ernst-Augustus being then bishop and prince of the place; and here also he died in the night of the 10th of June 1727, and, as some say, in the very room in which he was born. The bishopric is situated in the centre of the circle; the north part of it is marshy, and at the south extremity it is mountainous. The inhabitants have considerable manufactures.\nmanufactures of linen and a good breed of cattle; and of their hogs, for which they are remarkable, is made the best Westphalia bacon. Not far from this city are to be seen the ruins of an old church and castle called Beelzebub, which some say was built by King Witekind upon his conversion; and about two miles from it lies the monastery of Ittila, on the bank of a lake so deep, that report says it could never yet be fathomed. This was the first town in Westphalia which received the Lutheran doctrine.\n\nOSNABURG Island, one of the islands in the South sea, discovered by Captain Wallis in 1767. It is a high, round island, not above a league in circuit; in some parts covered with trees, in others a naked rock. S. Lat. 22° 48'. W.

He was educated at the university of Salamanca, and afterwards studied at Paris and Bologna. On his return to Portugal he gradually rose to the bishopric of Sylves, to which he was appointed by Catherine of Austria, regent of the kingdom in the minority of Sebastian. At the request of Cardinal Henry of Portugal, he wrote his History of King Emanuel, and the Expedition of Gama; which his great contemporary Camoens made at the same time the subject of his immortal Lusiad; a poem which has at length appeared with due lustre in our language, being translated with great spirit and elegance by Mr Mickle. It is remarkable that the history of Oforius, and the epic poem of Camoens, were published in the same year, 1572: but the fate of these two great authors were very different; the poet was suffered to perish in poverty, under the reign of that Henry who patronized the historian: yet allowing for the difference of their professions, they possessed a familiarity of mind. There appear many traces of that high heroic spirit even in the priest Oforius, which animated the soldier Camoens; particularly in the pleasure with which he seems to describe the martial manners of his countrymen under the reign of Emanuel. \"In that age (says the historian in the cloke of his manly work), poverty and sadness were banished from Portugal. Complaints were never heard; but every place, from the court to the cottage, resounded with mirth and music. Illicit love was unknown; nor would the ladies listen to the most honourable addresses of such youths as had not signalized themselves in war. No young man about court, however noble by birth, was permitted to wear the dress of manhood till he had passed over into Africa, and thence brought back with him some animal esteemed for its rarity; and such was the hardy education of the nobility in that age, that many of them travelled everywhere in quest of adventures.\" This is a striking picture of the manners of chivalry, to which Portugal owed much of its glory in that splendid period. There is one particular in the character of Oforius, which, considering his age and country, deserves the highest encomium; and that is his tolerating spirit. In the first book of his history, he speaks of Emanuel's cruel persecution of the Jews in the following generous and exalted language: \"This (says he) was authorized neither by law nor by religion. Can men be compelled to believe what they reject with abhorrence? Do you take upon you to restrain the liberty of the will, or to fetter the under-\n\nflanding? Such an attempt must be unsuccessful; and Oforius is not acceptable to Christ, who expects from man devotion of the heart, and not that formal worship which is the offspring of pains and penalties. He wishes them to study his religion, and adopt it from conviction, not from terror: for who does not feel that forced belief is mere hypocrisy?\" Oforius is said to have used many arguments to dissuade Sebastian from his unfortunate expedition into Africa, and to have felt so deeply the miseries which befell the Portuguese after that fatal event, that his grief was supposed to accelerate his death. He expired in 1580, happy, says De Thou (who celebrates him as a model of Christian virtue), that he died just before the Spanish army entered Portugal, and thus escaped being a witness to the desolation of his country.—His various works were published at Rome in 1592, by his nephew Oforius, in four volumes folio, with a life of their author. Among these are two remarkable productions; the first, An Admonition to our Queen Elizabeth, exhorting her to return into the Church of Rome; the second, An Essay on Glory, written with such classical purity, as to give birth to a report, that it was not the composition of Oforius, but the last work of Cicero on that subject.\n\nOSPREEY. See Falco, Ornithology Index.\n\nOSSA, a lofty mountain of Thessaly, near the Peneus, which runs between this mountain and Olympus; famous in the fabulous story of the giants (Homer, Virgil, Horace, Seneca, Ovid). The bending and unbending of its pines, on the blowing of a strong north wind, formed a clashing sound like thunder (Lucan). It was once the residence of the Centaurs, and was formerly joined to Mount Olympus; but Hercules, as some report, separated them, and made between them the celebrated valley of Tempe. This separation of the two mountains was more probably effected by an earthquake which happened about 1885 years before the Christian era. Its greatest celebrity arises from its being one of those mountains which the giants in their wars against the gods heaped up one on the other to scale the heavens with more facility. A town of Macedonia.\n\nOSSAT, Arnauld de, a learned French ecclesiastic, was born in the diocese of Auch in 1536, of mean parentage, and was taken notice of by a gentleman in the diocese, who made him study with his ward the Lord of Cafflenan de Magnoac. He studied the law at Dijon under Cujace, and applied himself to the bar at Paris. He was secretary at Rome to M. de Foix, archbishop of Toulouse; to Cardinal Elite; and afterwards to cardinal de Joyeuse, by the French king's express command. After rising to the highest dignities both in church and state, in 1599 he was created a cardinal by Pope Clement VIII. He died in 1604. An eminent French writer gives him the following character: \"He was a man of prodigious penetration: applied himself so closely to affairs, and especially was judicious in forming his resolutions, that it is almost impossible to find out one false step in the many negotiations in which he was concerned.\" His works, and especially his letters, have been much esteemed in the learned world.\n\nOSSIAN, the son of Fingal, a celebrated Celtic poet, who flourished about the end of the second and beginning\nbeginning of the third century. Several incidents in his poems point out this as his era: particularly the engagement of Fingal with Caracul, or Caracalla, the son of the emperor Severus, styled by Offian, The Son of the King of the World. M. Tillemont fixes the elevation of Caracalla to a share in the government to the year 193, and the association of his brother Geta to 208. About which time Gibbon fixes the Caledonian war, and speaks thus upon the subject: \"This Caledonian war, neither marked by decisive events, nor attended with any important consequences, would ill deserve our attention; but it is supposed, not without a considerable degree of probability, that the invasion of Severus is connected with the most flourishing period of the British history or fable. Fingal, whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been revived in our language by a recent publication, is said to have commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture, to have eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a signal victory on the banks of the Caran, in which the Son of the King of the World, Caracul, fled from his arms along the fields of his pride.*\n\nSomething of a doubtful kind still hangs over these Highland traditions; nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most ingenious researches of modern criticism (A); but if we could with safety indulge the pleasing supposition, that Fingal lived, and that Offian sang, the striking contrast of the situation and manners of the contending nations might amuse a philosophic mind. The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more civilized people, if we compared the unrelenting revenge of Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal; the timid and brutal cruelty of Caracalla, with the bravery, the tenderness, the elegant genius of Offian; the mercenary chiefs who, from motives of fear or interest, served under the Imperial standard, with the free-born warriors who started at arms at the voice of the king of Morven: if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored Caledonians glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the degenerate Romans polluted with the mean vices of wealth and slavery.\"\n\nThe date of this action, if the poems be true, is rather confounding; for the next expedition, which is produced to fix the time in which Offian flourished, was conducted by Oscar (against the usurped Carausius, the Caros of Offian), who did not assume the purple till so late as the year 287. This account indeed corresponds pretty well with the account given by Irish histories, which place the death of Fingal in the year 283, and that of Oscar (who died many years before his father Offian) in the year 296. These hints are not thrown out because we think they militate against the authenticity of the poems; for dilatant though these dates be, it is yet possible to reconcile them. Old age was and is very common in those regions; and Offian himself, we are told, was an instance of great longevity. Indeed at such a distance of time, it cannot be expected that we should give either a very particular or a very exact account of Offian and his heroes. Were there no doubts remaining of the truth of the facts, it is still natural to suppose that they may have suffered obscurity through the rust of time, and above all through the neglect of the poems, which till lately were unknown.\n\nThe first expedition on which Offian's father sent him was, to raise a stone on the banks of Crona, to perpetuate the memory of a victory which the king of Morven had obtained at that place. The Highlanders talk of this as being emblematical of that immortality which heroes were to receive from his future compositions. In this expedition he was accompanied by Tofcar, father of the beautiful Malvina, the amiable companion of his grief, after the death of her beloved Oscar, his son. It appears from his poems, that in one of his early expeditions to Ireland, he had fallen in love with and married Evirallin, daughter to Branno, petty king of Lego. \"I went in suit of the maid of Lego's fable surge; twelve of my people were there, the sons of streamy Morven. We came to Branno, friend of strangers; Branno of the founding mail.—From whence (he said) are the arms of steel? Not easy to win is the maid that has denied the blue-eyed sons of Erin. But blest be thou, O son of Fingal! happy is the maid that waits thee. Though twelve daughters were mine, thine were the choice, thou son of fame.\"—Then he opened the hall of the maid; the dark-haired Evirallin.* This Evirallin *Fingal*, was the mother of his son Oscar, whose exploits he B.iv. celebrates in many of his poems, and whose death he laments in the first book of Temora. Evirallin died some time before Oscar (FINGAL, B. iv.), who seems to have been her only child; and Offian did not marry afterwards; so that his posterity ended in the death of Oscar; who seems to have died as he was about to be married to Malvina, the daughter of Tofcar. Several of her lamentations for her lover are recorded by Offian, which paint her grief in the strongest and most beautiful colours. \"It is the voice of my love! few are his visits to my dreams.—But thou dwellest in the soul of Malvina, son of mighty Offian. My sighs arise with the beams of the east; my tears descend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree in thy presence, Oscar, with all my branches round me: but thy death came like a blast from the desert, and laid my green head low; the spring returned with its showers, but no green leaf of mine arose.\" Poem of Cromla.\n\nThe principal residence of Offian was in the vale in Cona, now Glencoe, in Argyllshire. See FINGAL.\n\nHis poems relate many of his expeditions to Ireland,\n\n---\n\n(A) \"That the Caracul of Offian is the Caracalla of the Roman history, is perhaps the only point of British antiquity in which Mr Macpherson and Mr Whitaker are of the same opinion; and yet the opinion is not without difficulty. In the Caledonian war, the son of Severus was known only by the appellation of Antoninus; and it may seem strange that the Highland bard should describe him by a nick name, invented four years afterwards, scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor, and seldom employed by the most ancient historians. See Dion. lib. lxvii. p. 1317. Hist. August. p. 89. Aurel. Viator. Euseb. in Chron. ad ann. 214.\nland, Scandinavia, Clyde, and Tweed or Teutha. His exploits on these occasions, after making a large allowance for poetical exaggeration, show him to have been no less a warrior than a poet. (See Ossian's Works, in the poems Caillum and Colmáil, Lathmon, Berrathon, &c.) By these expeditions, which were always undertaken for the relief of the distressed, the mind of Ossian seems to have been cultivated and enlarged beyond what is usually to be met with in so rude a period of society as that in which he lived. His poems breathe, throughout, such a spirit of generosity and tenderness, especially towards the fair sex, as is seldom or never to be met with in the compositions of other poets who lived in a more advanced state of civilization. He lived to an extreme old age; having survived all his family and friends, many of whom perished by a fatal accident, recorded in one of his poems called the fall of Tura *. Malvina alone, the love of his son Ossian, remained with him till within a few years of his death, and paid him every attention that could be expected from the tender relation in which she stood to him. To her he addresses many of his poems, which seem to have been composed for the most part in his old age. Her death is pathetically lamented by him in the poem of Berrathon: towards the close of which, he gives the preludes of his own departure; an event which he often wishes for, under the blindness and other calamities of his declining years.\n\n\"Roll on, ye dark brown years, for ye bring no joy on your course. Let the tomb open to Ossian, for his strength has failed. The sons of the long are gone to rest: my voice remains, like a blast, that roars lonely, on the sea surrounded rock, after the winds are laid. The dark moss whistles there, and the distant mariner sees the waving trees.\" But Ossian is a tree that is withered. Its branches are blasted and bare; no green leaf covers its boughs. From its trunk no young shoot is seen to spring. The breeze whistles in its gray moss: the blast shakes its head of ages.—The storm will soon overturn it, and strew all its dry branches with thee, O Dermid! and with all the rest of the mighty dead, in the green winding vale of Cona t.\"\n\nIt is not certain at what age Ossian died; but from his having been long blind with years, and from the many contrasts between his present and past situations, in poems composed, as it would appear, at a considerable distance of time from each other, it is most likely he lived to an extreme old age. The current tradition is, that he died in the house of a Culdee, called the Son of Alpin, with whom he is said to have held several conferences about the doctrines of Christianity. One of these dialogues is still preserved, and bears the genuine marks of a very remote antiquity; (Differation prefixed to Ossian's Works). Several of Ossian's poems are addressed to this son of Alpin, who was probably one of those Christians whom the persecution under Diocletian had driven beyond the pale of the Roman empire.\n\nThe poems of Ossian, though always held in the highest esteem by those who knew them, were allowed to remain in the obscurity of their original Gaelic, till Mr Macpherson, above 40 years ago, translated a collection of them into English, which immediately attracted the attention of every person who had a true taste for poetry. Dr Blair, in particular, introduced these poems into the world with those critical remarks which do no less honour to himself than to the poet. According to that eminent critic, the two great characteristics of Ossian's poetry are tenderness and sublimity. Ossian is, perhaps, the only poet who never relaxes, or lets himself down into the light and amusing strain. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and pathetic. The events which he records are all serious and grave; the scenes wild and romantic. We find not in him an imagination that sports itself, and drestles out gay trifles to please the fancy. His poetry, more perhaps than that of any other, deserves to be styled the poetry of the heart. It is a heart penetrated with noble sentiments, with sublime and tender passions; a heart that glows and kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours itself forth. Of all the great poets, Homer is the one whose manner and whole times come nearest to Ossian's. Homer's ideas were more enlarged, and his characters more diversified. Ossian's ideas fewer, but of the kind fitted for poetry; the bravery and generosity of heroes, the tenderness of lovers, and the attachment of friends. Homer is diffuse; Ossian abrupt and concise. His images are a blaze of lightning, which flash and vanish. Homer has more of impetuosity and fire; Ossian of a solemn and awful grandeur. In the pathetic, Homer has a great power; but Ossian exerts that power much oftener, and has the character of tenderness more deeply impressed on his works. No poet knew better how to seize and melt the heart. With regard to dignity of sentiment, we must be surprised to find that the pre-eminence must clearly be given to the Celtic bard. This appears nowhere more remarkable than in the sentiments which he expresses towards his enemies. \"Uthal fell beneath my sword, and the sons of Berrathon fled.—It was then I saw him in his beauty, and the tear hung in my eye. Thou art fallen, young tree, I said, with all thy beauty round thee. Thou art fallen on thy plains, and the field is bare. The winds come from the desert, and there is no sound in thy leaves! Lovely art thou in death, son of car-borne Lathmore t.\" His supposition, that all the little feuds and differences of Works, this life should be forgotten in a future state, and that poems of those who had once been foes would \"stretch their arms to the same shell in Leda,\" gives us the highest idea of the man as well as of the poet. \"Daughter of beauty, thou art low! A strange throe receives thy corse. But the ghosts of Morven will open their halls when they see thee coming. Heroes around the feast of dim thells, in the midst of clouds shall admire thee; and virgins shall touch the harp of mist t.\" The Gaelic feuds of other years by the mighty dead are forgotten. Antiquities. The warriors now meet in peace, and ride together, poem on the temple's wing. No clang of the shield, no Trathal, noise of the spear, is heard in their peaceful dwellings. Side by side they sit, who once mixed in battle their feet. There, Lochlin and Morven meet at the mutual feast, and lift together to the song of their bards t.\" Ib. poem\n\nBut the sublimity of moral sentiments, if they want of Darga, ed the softening of the tender, would be in hazard of giving a stiff air to poetry. It is not enough that we admire. Admiration is a cold feeling in comparison of that deep interest the heart takes in tender and pathetic scenes. With scenes of this kind Ossian abounds; and\nand his high merit in these is incontestible. He may be blamed for drawing tears too often from our eyes; but that he has the power of commanding them no man who has the least sensibility can question. His poems awake the tenderest sympathies, and inspire the most generous emotions. No reader can rise from him without being warmed by the sentiments of humanity, virtue, and honour.\n\nBut the excellency of these poems occasioned in many persons a doubt of their authenticity. Their genuineness, however, has been very ably defended by Dr Blair and Lord Kames, and warmly supported by the author of the Gaelic Antiquities, who has given the public some more remains of Ossian's poetry.\n\nAs the nature of our work will not allow us to treat this matter at full length, we shall only give a brief view of the arguments offered in support of the authenticity of these poems, referring our readers to the authors just now mentioned and others, for fuller satisfaction.\n\n\"In every period of society (says Dr Blair), human manners are a curious spectacle; and the most natural pictures of ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of nations. These make us acquainted with the notions and feelings of our fellow-creatures in the most artless ages; discovering what objects they admired, and what pleasures they pursued, before those refinements of society had taken place, which enlarge indeed, and diversify the transactions, but dignify the manners of mankind.\n\n\"Besides this, ancient poems have another merit with persons of taste. They promise some of the highest beauties of poetical writing. That state, in which human nature flows wild and free, though unfit for other improvements, certainly encourages the high exertions of fancy and passion.\n\n\"In the infancy of societies the passions of men have nothing to restrain them; their imagination has nothing to check it. And as their feelings are strong, so their language of itself assumes a poetical turn. Men never have used so many figures of style, as in those rude ages, when, besides a warm imagination to suggest lively images, the want of proper and precise terms for the ideas they would express, obliged them to have recourse to circumlocution, metaphor, comparison, and all those substituted forms of expression, which give a poetical air to language. An American chief, at this day, harangues at the head of his tribe in a more bold metaphorical style than a modern European would adventure to use in an epic poem.\n\n\"Poetry has been said to be more ancient than prose, which, in a qualified sense, is true. Music or song has been found coeval with society among the most barbarous nations; and the only subjects which could prompt men, in their first rude state, to utter their thoughts in compositions of any length, were such as naturally assumed the tone of poetry; praises of their gods, or of their ancestors; commemorations of their own warlike exploits; or lamentations over their misfortunes. And before writing was invented, no other compositions, except songs or poems, could take such hold of the imagination and memory, as to be preserved by oral tradition, and handed down from one race to another.\n\nVol. XV. Part II.\n\n\"Hence we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all nations. It is probable, too, that an extensive search would discover a certain degree of resemblance among all the most ancient poetical productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a similar state of manners, similar objects and passions operating upon the imaginations of men, will stamp their productions with the same general character. Some diversity will, no doubt, be occasioned by climate and genius. But mankind never bear such resembling features as they do in the beginnings of society. What we call the oriental vein of poetry, because the earliest poetical productions have come to us from the east, is probably no more oriental than accidental; it is characteristic of an age rather than a country; and belongs, in some measure, to all nations at a certain period. Of this the works of Ossian seem to furnish a remarkable proof.\n\n\"He appears clearly to have lived in a period which enjoyed all the benefit I have just now mentioned of traditionary poetry. The exploits of Trathal, Tremor, and the other ancestors of Fingal, are spoken of as familiarly known. Ancient bards are frequently alluded to. In one remarkable passage, Ossian describes himself as living in a sort of classical age, enlightened by the memorials of former times, conveyed in the songs of bards, and points at a period of ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition. Ossian himself appears to have been endowed by nature with exquisite sensibility; prone to that tender melancholy which is so often an attendant on great genius; and susceptible equally of strong and of soft emotions. He was not only a professed bard, but a warrior also, and the son of the most renowned hero and prince of his age. This formed a conjunction of circumstances, uncommonly favourable towards exalting the imagination of a poet.\n\n\"The manners of Ossian's age were favourable to a poetical genius. Covetousness and effeminacy were unknown. The cares of men were few. The great object purified by heroic spirit, was, 'to receive their fame,' that is, to become worthy of being celebrated in the songs of bards; and 'to have their names on the four gray stones.' To die lamented by a bard was deemed to great a misfortune as even to disturb their ghosts in another state. In such times as these, in a country where poetry had been so long cultivated, and so highly honoured, is it any wonder that, among the race and succession of bards, one Homer should arise: a man who, endowed with a natural, happy genius, favoured by peculiar advantages of birth and condition: and meeting, in the course of his life, with a variety of incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch his heart, should attain a degree of eminence in poetry, worthy to draw the admiration of more refined ages?\"\n\nBesides, his compositions, when viewed in themselves, have, we are told, all the internal marks of antiquity strongly impressed upon them, that no reader of taste and judgement can deny their claim to it. They exhibit so lively a picture of customs which have disappeared for ages, as could be drawn only from nature and real life. The features are so distinct, that few portraits of the life continually passing before us are found to be drawn with so much likeness. The manners uniformly relate to a very early stage of society; and no hint, no allusion to the arts, customs, or manners, of a more advanced\nvance period, appears throughout the poems. To that distinction of ranks, which is always found in adult societies, the poet appears to have been a perfect stranger. The first heroes prepare their own repasts, and indiscriminately confide to the most menial services. Their quarrels arise from causes generally slight, but in such a period extremely natural. A rivalry in love, an omission at a feast, or an affront at a tournament, are often the foundation of a quarrel among single heroes. And the wars in which whole tribes are engaged, are carried on with a view, not to enlarge their territory, but to revenge perhaps the killing of a few deer on their mountains, or the taking forcibly away one of their women. Their occupation was war and hunting; and their chief ambition was to have their fame in the songs of the bards.\n\nThe notions of a future state, exhibited in these poems, are likewise strongly marked with the character of antiquity. A creed so uncommon, that the imagination of a modern could not be supposed to grasp so strong an idea of it from mere fancy, is uniformly supported throughout. This creed is extremely simple, but admirably suited to the times.\n\nThe language, too, and the structure, of these poems, bear the most striking characters of antiquity. The language is bold, animated, and metaphorical, such as it is found to be in all infant states; where the words, as well as the ideas and objects, must be few; and where the language, like the imagination, is strong and undisciplined. No abstract, and few general, terms appear in the poems of Ossian. If objects are but introduced in a simile, they are always particularized. It is \"the young pine of Inithuna;\" it is \"the bow of the thorny Lena.\" This character, so conspicuous in the poems of Ossian, is a striking feature in the language of all early states; whose objects and ideas are few and particular, and whose ordinary conversation is of course highly figurative and poetical. A picture, therefore, marked with such striking features, could not be drawn without an original.\n\nThe whole texture of the composition is also, like the language, bold, nervous, and concise; yet always plain and artless; without any thing of that modern refinement, or elaborate decoration, which attend the advancement of literature. No foreign ornaments are hunted after. The wild and grand nature which lay within the poet's view, is the only source from which he draws his ornaments. Beyond this circle, his imagination, though quick and rapid, seldom made any excursion. We perceive his language always to be that of a person who saw and felt what he describes; who bore a part in the expeditions which he celebrates, and who fought in the battles which he sings. Such is the nature of the internal proof adduced in the present case, which unquestionably has weight, and that not inconsiderable; but unsupported by external proof, or contrary to facts, however forcible it may be in itself, when considered in this connection, and found wanting, it will neither silence the querulous sceptic, nor, in all probability, will it ever convince those who have truth for their object, and who wish to investigate, and, if possible, discover it on surer grounds. Internal proof is of the greatest service in a variety of excellent causes; but it comes in rather as a succedaneum than as direct evidence; and without something more to the purpose, it may excite admiration, but will seldom enforce belief.\n\nOf the customs and manners of ancient times we know but little, and of that little we have often but a confused notion. There is therefore room for genius and ability to exert itself in deceiving; and in proportion to the darkness in which the subject is involved, the deception will generally be the more complete, and the secret windings of error less easy to be developed.\n\nDefective of external proof, authenticity may appear to be probable, but cannot be certain; and in such circumstances, on many occasions, and especially with respect to ancient writings, we may, without any offence to truth or to sound reasoning, give them up as spurious. In the present instance, therefore, it is just and proper to add to what has been already said, the more external and positive proofs of the authenticity of the poems in question, by the strength or weakness of which the subject must be finally determined. It is observed, therefore, That there have been in the Highlands of Scotland, for some ages back, a vast many poems ascribed to Ossian: That these poems have been held in the highest veneration, repeated by almost all persons, and on all occasions. There are facts so well known, that nobody as yet has been hardy enough to deny them. There is not an old man in the Highlands, who will not declare, that he heard such poems repeated by his father and grandfather as pieces of the most remote antiquity. There is not a district in the Highlands where there are not many places, waters, hills, caves, and mountains, which from time immemorial are called after the names of Ossian's heroes.—There is not a lover of ancient tale or poetry, however illiterate, who is not well acquainted with almost every single name, character, and incident, mentioned in those translations of Ossian's poems, which he may have never heard of.—Bards, who are themselves several centuries old, quote those poems, imitate them, and refer to them.—The ordinary conversation and companions of the Highlanders frequently allude to the customs and characters mentioned in them—and many of their most common proverbs, established by the most ancient use, are lines borrowed from the poems of Ossian.*—The most ancient of the *See extracts boast of deriving their pedigree, each from some names under each of Ossian's heroes;—and many of the signs armorial assumed by them, are drawn from the feats ascribed to their predecessors in those poems†. Manuscripts are Antiquities, mentioned, in which some of those have been preserved‡; p. 93, for several centuries‡; and a list of living names, in different parts of the Highlands, is appealed to, as persons who still repeat a part of these poems‖. Whilst Mr Macpherson was engaged in the translation, many respectable persons, gentlemen and clergymen, avowed to the public, that these were Ossian's poems, with which they had long been acquainted, and that the translation was literal§. This appears also from the 123. large specimens of the originals published and compared §See list of by proper judges. The originals lay a considerable number of names, Appendix to the hands of the bookseller, for the inspection of Dr Blair's the curious; they have been afterwards shown frequently to many of the best judges, and offered for publication, Ossian if the editor had been favoured with subscriptions. The editor of the pamphlet, in which their authenticity is attested by many respectable names of undoubted veracity, observes, by way of conclusion, \"that more testimonies might have been produced by a more enlarged correspondence.\"\ncorrespondence with the Highland counties: But I apprehend, if any apology is necessary, it is for producing so many names in a question where the conferring silence of a whole country was, to every unprejudiced person, the strongest proof that spurious compositions, in the name of that country, had not been obtruded upon the world.\" It is likewise argued in support of the authenticity of these poems, that candid sceptics, on hearing some of them repeated by illiterate persons, who had never seen the translation, caused them to give the meaning of what they repeated, by an extempore translation into English, and by this means had all their doubts of the authenticity of Ossian removed *. They urge further, that such palliages of Ossian's works as are still beautiful parts of Ossian's poems; such as the battle of Lora, the most affecting parts of Cartho, Berrathon, the death of Ossian, and Darthula, or the children of Ufioth, &c.; which gives a credibility to his being equal to the other parts of the collection, none of it being superior to those in merit.\n\nTo these and the like arguments advanced in support of the authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian, many objections have been urged. Those of Johnson and his friend Shaw are universally known. A later writer objects to them in the following manner: No fragments of British poetry in Scotland are to be found. Many specimens of Irish poetry in Scotland have been published; but none older than a century or two. Translations have also appeared; but, in general, of no fidelity. Those of the poems ascribed to Ossian, in particular, have deservedly drawn much of the public attention; but they will only mislead any reader who wishes to form an idea of Celtic poetry. He that believes Ossian to have flourished about the year 300, and his writings preserved by oral tradition for 1460 years, is his faith, and he might move mountains! Gentlemen of the Highlands of Scotland, with whom our author conversed on the subject, assured him, that they looked upon nine-tenths of Mr Macpherson's work as his own; and upon the other tenth, as so much changed by him, that all might be regarded as his own composition. There are positive evidences, he says, which convince him that not one of the poems given to Ossian, and probably not one palliage of them, is older than the 15th century. The very first author we know who mentions Fingal, is Barbour, a Scotch poet, who wrote in 1375. Fingal was an Irish hero: and one Good, a schoolmaster of Limerick, sent some account of Ireland to Camden, in 1566, in which mention is made of some strange fables, that the people amuse themselves with, about the \"giants Fin Mac Huyle, and Otker Mac O'huin,\" of which we shall speak more largely presently. In the mean time, to these and such like objections, it has been answered, That poetry has been cultivated with most success in the earliest ages of society; that in Greece, Orpheus, Linus, Hesiod, and Homer, wrote their admirable poems some ages before any thing had been written in prose in the Greek language; that the book of Job, written in a very early period of society, is highly poetical; that among the tribes of Lapland and America, there have been found, in the earliest state, some excellent pieces of poetry. That the Caledonians, in particular, had some peculiar institutions, which tended to improve their poetry: their druids were among the most learned philosophers which perhaps any age or country produced; their bards or poets were the disciples of those druids, and were always a standing order, to which none but the most promising geniuses were admitted. This standing college of poets was furnished, not only with the fruits of their own long study and observation, but also with as much as merited to be preserved of the compositions of their predecessors in office, since the \"light of the long?\" first dawned. They had the advantage of one another's conversation; which would excite their emulation, and make them aspire to eminence: They were always present, and generally engaged, in every grand operation that was transacted; which could not fail to inspire their muse with the truest poetic fire.\n\nThe case of Ossian was particularly favourable. He lived in an age when manners came to a considerable degree of refinement under the care of the bards and druids. Poetry in his day was considerably advanced; and the language, though strong and figurative, had undergone some degree of cultivation, and learned to flow in regular numbers, adapted to the harp, the favourite instrument of the times. As a prince and a warrior, his mind must have been expanded and much enlarged by his excursions to other countries. At home he had Ullin, Alpin, Carril, and Ryno, to converse with; all of them poets of eminence, who would have advanced him greatly by their example and conversation. All these advantages, meeting with a native fire and enthusiasm of genius, as in the case of Ossian, may well be supposed to have produced poems that might challenge the veneration of ages.\n\nBut it is not to their merit alone that we owe the preservation of these poems so long by oral tradition. Other circumstances concurred; of which, the institution of the Bards deserves particular notice. In a country, the only one perhaps in the world in which there was always, from the earliest period almost to the present age, a standing order of poets, we cannot reasonably be surprized, either at finding excellent poems composed, or, after being composed, carefully preserved from oblivion. A great part of the benefits of this order was to watch over the poems of Ossian. In every family of distinction there was always one principal bard, and a number of disciples, who vied with each other in having these poems in the greatest perfection. Should the institution of the bards last for ever, the poems of Ossian could never perish.\n\nNor were they the only bards of great families who took an interest in these poems; the valiant, equally fond of the song with his superior, entertained himself in the same manner. This, with a life free from care, a spirit unbroken by labour, and a space of time unoccupied by any other employment or diversion, contributed to render the Highlanders a nation of singers and poets. From such a people, the superior merit of Ossian's poems would naturally procure every encouragement, which they always retained as long as the manners of the people remained unchanged.\n\nMany other reasons conspired to preserve the poems of Ossian. The martial and intrepid spirit which they breathed, made it the interest of the chieftains to preserve them: the strain of justice, generosity, and humanity, which runs through them, recommended them to the superintendants of religion, who well knew how much\nmuch the morals of a people must be tinged with those songs which they are continually repeating, and which have all the advantages of poetry and of music. In superstitious ages, the people revered these poems, from their being addressed generally to some \"son of the rock,\" supposed to be the tutelar saint of the place, or the great Irish apostle St Patrick. Besides, every hill and dale which the natives of the Highlands walked over, was classic ground. Every mountain, rocks, and river, was immortalized in the song. This song would naturally be suggested by the sight of these objects, and everybody would hum it as he walked along. All the proverbs and customs to which these poems gave rise, would operate in the same manner. The son would ask what they meant, and the father would repeat the song from which they were taken. The distinct and unblurred state in which the Highlanders remained for so long a course of ages, every clan, one generation after another, inhabiting the same valley, till towards the present century, contributed much to preserve their traditions and their poems; and the constant and general custom of repeating them in the winter nights, kept them always alive in their remembrance.\n\nTo these causes and customs the preservation of Ossian's poems, for so many ages, has been ascribed. But these causes and customs have ceased to exist; and the poems of Ossian, of course, have ceased to be repeated.—Within a century back, the Highlands of Scotland have undergone a greater revolution than it had done for ten before that period. With a quicker pace the feudal system vanished; property fluctuated; new laws and new customs swept in, and supplanted the old; and all this, with such sudden and such violent convulsions, as may well account for the shaking of a fabric which had stood so many ages, that it seemed to have bidden defiance to all the injuries of time. Even since Mr Macpherson gathered the poems in his collection, the amusements, employments, and taste of the Highlanders are much altered. A greater attention to commerce, agriculture, and pasturage, has quite engrossed that partial attention which was paid, even then, to the song of the bard. In twenty years hence, if manners continue to change so fast as they do at present, the faintest traces will scarce be found of these tales and poems. \"Ossian himself is the last of his race; and he too shall soon be no more, for his gray branches are already strewn on all the winds.\"\n\nAmong the causes which make these poems vanish so rapidly, poverty and the iron rod should come in for a large share. From the baneful shade of those murderers of the muse, the light of the song must fast retire. No other reason needs be given why the present Highlanders neglect so much the songs of their fathers.—Once, the humble, but happy vassal, sat at his ease, at the foot of his grey rock or green tree. Few were his wants, and fewer still his cares; for he beheld his herds sporting around him, on his then unmeasured mountain. He hummed the careless song, and tuned his harp with joy, while his soul in silence blessed his children.—Now, we were going to draw the comparison:\n\nsed Cynthiae aurem.\nVellit et admonuit.\n\nIt is more agreeable to remark, as another cause for the neglect of ancient poems and traditions, the growth of industry, which fills up all the blanks of time to more advantage, and especially the increase of more useful knowledge.—But above all, the extinction of the order of the bards hastened the catastrophe of Ossian's poems. By a happy coincidence Macpherson overtook the last that remained of this order, (Macvaugh, bard to Clanranald,) and got his treasure. This fact (with the red book furnished by Mr Macdonald of Creidart, and some other MSS.) accounts for Mr Macpherson's having found these poems in greater number and perfection than they could ever since be met with. The fragments, however, which have since been gathered, give a credibility to every thing that has been said of the original grandeur of the building.\n\nAlthough this disputation has already extended to a length which readers not partial to Scottish antiquities will perhaps think too great, we cannot dismiss it without observing, that Fingal and Ossian have been claimed by the Irish as well as by the Caledonians. On this double claim, as well as on the controversy concerning the authenticity of the poems, there is so much candour and good sense in the following remarks of T. F. Hill, published in the 53d volume of the Gentleman's Magazine, that we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of making them conclude the article.\n\nMr Hill travelled through the Highlands of Scotland during the summer months of 1780. He seems to have been very ardent in his inquiries concerning Ossian, and to have conducted those inquiries with great judgement. The consequence was, that he received different accounts in different places, and picked up various songs relating to Fingal and his heroes.\n\n\"From this collection, it is evident (says he) that there are many traditional songs preserved in the Highlands relating to Fingal and his heroes, as well as to several other subjects. It is also evident, that these songs contain portions of the very poems published by Mr Macpherson and Mr Smith, under the name of Ossian. We may therefore justly conclude, that these poems are not wholly the forgery of their editors, but compiled at least from original songs. I by no means think it worth my while to notice the various conjectures in favour of this conclusion, which the minor antagonists of Ossian have of late been forced to make. I myself have given proofs of it, which need I hope no external confirmation. To these proofs might be added, that I met with many traditional preservers of these songs, in every different part of the Highlands: in some of whom, especially in Argyllshire, Lochaber, and on the rest of the western coast, were said to possess various poems attributed to Ossian, although I had neither leisure nor opportunity to collect copies from them.—But enough has already been said on this subject, if my testimony deserves regard.\n\n\"These principles being established, it remains to be considered how far the poems published by Macpherson and Smith deserve to be considered as the works of Ossian.\n\n\"The songs attributed to that bard, which contain passages of the Ossian of Macpherson and Smith, are by no means uniformly consistent with the poems in which the...\"\nthe parallel passages are found, but frequently relate to different events, and even contain different circumstances. From hence it seems most probable, that Mr Macpherson and Mr Smith compiled their publications from those parts of the Highland songs which they most approved, combining them into such forms as according to their ideas were most excellent, and preferring the old names and the leading events. In this process they were supported and encouraged by the variety of songs preserved in the Highlands upon the same subject, and by the various modes in which the same event is related. Mr Macpherson may indeed have MSS. of all the poems he has published; which MSS. may either have been compiled by himself, or by some former collector; or they may possibly contain entire poems really ancient. But Mr Smith has honestly acknowledged, that he himself compiled his Ossian in the manner above described.\n\n\"After the materials were collected (says he), the next labour was to compare the different editions; to strike off several parts that were manifestly spurious; to bring together some episodes that appeared to have a relation to one another, though repeated separately; and restore to their proper places some incidents that seemed to have run from one poem to another;—and hence it was unavoidably necessary to throw in sometimes a few lines or sentences to join some of the episodes together.—I am sensible that the form of these poems is considerably altered from what is found in any one of the editions from which they are compiled. They have assumed somewhat more of the appearance of regularity and art—than that bold and irregular manner in which they are originally delivered.\"\n\n\"Mr Smith also speaks of the Ossian of Mr Macpherson in a somewhat similar manner: 'That we have not the whole of the poems of Ossian, or even of the collection translated by Mr Macpherson, we allow; yet still we have many of them, and of almost all a part. The building is not entire, but we have still the grand ruins of it.'\n\n\"What portion, therefore, of the Ossian of Macpherson and Smith is original, no man can determine except themselves. Smith indeed says, that he has mentioned all his material alterations, transpositions, and additions, in his notes; and that, for the most part, he was guided in them by the Sgeulachds, or traditionary tales accompanying the songs; but there are few such notes in his book, and perhaps as few such Sgeulachds in the mouths of the Highlanders. In Macpherson and Smith also we see these poems divested of their idiomatic peculiarities and fabulous ornaments; which renders it impossible to discover what manners and opinions are really ancient, and what are of modern invention. Yet it is remarkable, that in spite of all the objections to their authenticity, necessarily produced by such a treatment of them, they still possess an internal evidence of originality which has enabled them hitherto to withstand all the torrent of opposition.\n\n\"The Ossian of Macpherson and Smith appears there-\n\n(A) \"The Scots indeed lay claim to the birth of St Patrick, and boast also his burial-place. Camden, edit: Gibbon, 1695, pp. 921, 1014. And so also do the Britons, ib. p. 631, 1014; but his life and miracles all agree to attribute it to Ireland. In Gough's edition of Camden, the account of St Patrick is in vol. iii. p. 612, 618. See Patrick, St.\"\nthat I have never seen enough of them to give any decided opinion; those which I have seen induce me to think they principally owe their existence to Ireland.\n\n\"I shall not repeat what others have said to prove the Fingalians Irish; though the connection of Fingal with Ireland has been already warmly asserted.\n\n\"But an unnoticed though curious passage in Camden affords us the most remarkable, and perhaps the most convincing proof, that Fingal is an Irish hero, which demonstrates at least that he was indisputably claimed by the Irish two centuries ago. It is contained in an extract (already mentioned) made by Camden, from an account of the manners of the native Irish, written by one Good, a Schoolmaster at Limerick, in 1566. 'They think,' says he, speaking of Ireland and its inhabitants, 'the souls of the deceased are in communion with famous men of those places, of whom they retain many stories and fables; as of the giants Finnmac-Huyle, Otkir-Mac-Oshin, or Otkir-Mac-Ovrim; and they say, through illusion, that they often see them.'\n\n\"The very material importance of this curious passage, with relation to the present subject, it is unnecessary to urge; for every eye must see it. We also obtain from it new information in respect to the last part of the history of Fingal and his heroes; as it enables us to determine who they were with a precision which must otherwise have been wanting, to complete these remarks on the Highland songs.\n\n\"The singular agreement of this passage with the accounts of Ossian which were taught me in Scotland is worthy particular remark; it confirms them even in the most novel and peculiar instances. The Fingalians were generally represented as giants; but the most remarkable occurrence is in the mythologic character attributed by both to Fingal, Otkar, and Ossian. In proof of this, I have to observe, that Mac Nab described Fingal as the Odin of the Scots, and that a song called Urnigh Ossian evidently speaks of him as such. This curious passage represents him exactly in the same character; a hero with whom the spirits of the deceased are in communion, who is their chieftain, and the lord of their feats. The gods of all the northern nations seem to have been of this class; mighty heroes, esteemed once to have been invincible on earth, though perhaps not ever strictly men, nor yet constantly regarded as giants. Such are Odin, Thor, and the other Teutonic gods; such are Fingal, Otkar, and the rest of the Fingalians among the ancient Scots; such are Hercules, Bacchus, and even Jupiter himself, with all his sons and daughters, among the original Greeks, a people who agreed in many particulars with our own ancestors in northern Europe. The notions entertained about ghosts, as an intermediate order of beings between men and divinities, endowed with some share of power to do evil, is also remarkably congruous with this mythology.\n\n\"As Fingal was a divine hero, so Ossian seems to have been a divine bard. Some of the gods of the Teutons were bards in like manner; the god Niord and his wife Skada quarrelled in elegant verse of their own composition; and Odin is the relator of his own Edda. Apollo, the poetical deity of Greece, likewise sung the history of his fellow-deities to men on earth, as well as Orpheus his son. The bards and traditional preservers of songs in Scotland and Ireland have ever been fond of ascribing all ancient poems to this Ossian, and especially those relating to his own race; and from this cause the poems ascribed to Ossian are become so voluminous. The ancient Egyptians had a similar custom of ascribing their works to Hermes: ἐπὶ τοῦ Ἑρμῆς ἔγραψαν τὰ κείμενα τῶν ποιημάτων, ἐπιγραφής τοῦ Ἑρμῆς ἐγέρασαν τὰ κείμενα τῶν ποιημάτων, says Jamblichus, S. I. c. i., which rendered the Hermetic writings equally voluminous. The Egyptians, who possessed the art of writing, deposited their works in the adyta of their temples; as the Arabians deposited their poems of old in the temple of Mecca: but because the Egyptians affixed to them no author's name, except that of Hermes, to him, as to the Scottish Ossian, almost all the national literature was attributed by religious flattery.\n\n\"I sincerely wish, that some gentleman possessed of adequate abilities and acquaintance with the Erse language, would undertake to collect these Ossianic songs in their simple original state; as they undoubtedly contain much curious knowledge, accumulated in the various ages through which they have descended to us, and would probably afford much new information on subjects at present very ill understood. I own, however, that I should rather choose to seek for them in Ireland than in Scotland; but neither country should be unexplored.\n\n\"After having thus freely, though I hope not uncandidly, delivered my sentiments on the Ossian of Mr Macpherson, it becomes me to acknowledge myself deeply indebted to it for the pleasure in perusal it has frequently afforded me. I am willing, and indeed happy, thus publicly to declare myself a warm admirer of it as a literary composition. The novelty of its manner, of its ideas, and of the objects it describes, added to the strength and brilliancy of genius which frequently appears in it, have enabled me to read it with more delight, and to return to it more frequently, than almost any other work of modern times. And let it be regarded in what light it may, the praise of elegant selection and composition certainly belongs to its editor. If I had not entertained these opinions of its merit, I should never have taken so much pains to investigate its authenticity; nor indeed can I believe, if the general opinion had not concurred with mine, that the world would ever have wasted so much time in disputing about it.\"\n\nSince what has now been said concerning the authenticity of the poems of Ossian was written, the same subject has been again brought under discussion, and more keenly and ably agitated than at any former period of the controversy. Among those who have entered the lists in this controversy, Mr Laing the historian appears by far the most powerful opponent of the authenticity of these celebrated poems. In a historical and critical dissertation* on this subject, Mr Laing roundly asserts, that the poems, as ascribed to Ossian, a bard of the third century, are forgeries, and charges Macpherson, as well as Smith, (in our opinion too hastily and rashly) with direct fraud in imposing on the world their own productions as the genuine translations of ancient Gaelic poems. The arguments for the detection of these forgeries are arranged under eight different heads: 1. The Roman History of Britain with which Macpherson has connected the poems by false and incorrect allusions. 2. The traditionary poems in the Highlands refer to the middle ages,\nOssification ages, that is, about the 9th and 10th centuries. 3. The difficulty or impossibility of preserving poems by oral tradition for a period of 1500 years. 4. The remarkable diversity in the manners of the Highlanders at the period in which Fingal lived, as described by historians, and as they are represented by Ossian; and the contradiction of great refinement at an early age and extreme barbarism in a future age, are considered by Mr Laing as strong and decisive proofs of forgery. 5. From tracing the origin of the poems to other works of Macpherson, particularly to an epic poem entitled the Highlander, published at Edinburgh in 1788, which, being unsuccessful, appeared afterwards as fragments of ancient poetry, Mr Laing thinks another proof of detection is derived. 6. A fifth source of detection, in his opinion, may be traced to the imitation of the classics, scripture, and other writings. 7. Mr Laing affirms that the specimens of the original produced by Macpherson were either written or translated into Erse from the English original, by the supposed translator himself. 8. From the ambiguous language which Macpherson seems to have employed at different times during the progress of the numerous editions of the poems, Mr Laing infers a distinct avowal of fraud. But for the illustration of the arguments now noticed we must refer the reader to the dissertation itself.\n\nIt was not to be expected that charges so formally adduced, and so keenly supported, would pass altogether unnoticed by the admirers of the poems of Ossian, or the believers in their authenticity. Accordingly, we find that Mr Laing's arguments have been combated by different writers with various success. Among the works on this side of the question which have fallen in our way, the Essay on the Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian by the Rev. Dr Graham, holds the most respectable place. But our limits absolutely preclude us even from stating his arguments. We refer therefore to the work itself which, the reader will not dislike to find, is written with some degree of elegance, and what is not usual in controversy, with a great degree of temper and moderation. The reader who wishes to pursue this investigation, may consult also a Treatise on the same subject by Mr Macdonald, the Report on Ossian by a Committee of the Highland Society of Scotland; and the Gaelic scholar has now an opportunity of perusing the Originals, which have been published by Sir John Sinclair.\n\nOSSIFICATION, in the animal economy, the formation of the bones, but more particularly the conversion of parts naturally soft to the hardness and consistence of bones. Bones, Dr Drake contends, are formed out of the most minute or broken parts of the blood; since we see that the blood of old men, which by a long course of circulation becomes in a manner unfit for the common office of nutrition, will however ossify, and convert into bones, many of the tendons and ligaments, and even the coats of the vessels themselves, whose substance being next to the bones the most compact, admits only of the smallest particles of the blood, which therefore soonest become effusive, as they are frequently found. Dr Niflet's opinion of ossification is, that in the blood, or a fluid secreted from it, there is an effusing juice, having particles which are not apparent: that whenever nature designs an ossification between membranes, or within a cartilage, she occasions a more than usual influx of this fluid; which so much distends the vessels which were before invisible, as to make them capable of receiving the red globules of blood, which is always to be seen near to the place where ossification is begun. In this blood gristy bony particles may be felt by the point of a knife, which have been formed by the attraction and cohesion of the particles of the ossifying juice obstructed, along with the other groser fluids, in the beginning of the vessels prepared to receive refulgent juices. The blood being capable of forming fine membranes, the membranous parts of a bone, which acts as a gluten to keep these particles and fibres together, if there be any such, that do not arise from the coats of its vessels, are produced by a cohesion round the retaceous particles of a part of the fluid, in which they were generated and contained. Thus the membranes of cartilages serve as a bed, between or within which the bony particles are deposed, or shod; but without any intermixture of the particles of the bone and cartilage, or continuation of the fibres of the one substance to those of the other, as is evident in cartilages containing bones kept long enough in water, and then slit; for the bone will, as soon as the large vessels that enter its substance are divided, slip as easily, and perhaps easier, from it than an acorn does out of its cup: and there is a smoothness and polish of the parts of both cartilage and bone, which show there is no conjunction of the fibres of the two substances. While the bones are increasing within cartilages, the cartilages are extended and spread out; by which, with the pressure which they suffer, and the great influx of various fluids, and the nutritious matter being hindered to flow freely into them, they decrease continually, and at last may truly be said to be entirely destroyed. Dr Buddens endeavours to prove, that the supernatural ossifications, which are commonly said to be formed in different parts of the body, do not deserve that name; for that these hard substances have scarcely any other properties of bone except whitening and hardening.\n\nOSSORY, the west division of Queen's-county in Ireland.\n\nOSSORY, Bale bishop of.

This place was taken by the Dutch in 1726, but restored to the emperor in 1724, when an East India company was established here, but entirely suppressed by treaty in 1731. It was taken by the French in August 1745, after 10 days' siege, but restored by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It was overrun by the French Republicans, with Dumourier at their head, but was quickly recovered by the junction of the allies. It was evacuated by the French in 1793, and they repopulated it in 1794. Here the British landed a body of troops in May 1798, who blew up and destroyed the works of the Bruges canal; but the wind shifting before they could re-embark, they were under the necessity of surrendering to the French. It is 10 miles W. of Bruges, eight N. E. of Newport, 22 N. E. of Dunkirk, and 65 N. W. of Brussels. E. Long. 2. 36. N. Lat. 51.\n\nOSTEOCOLLA, ὀστεοκόλλα, in Natural History, a white or ash-coloured sparry substance, in shape like a bone, and by some supposed to have the quality of uniting broken bones, on which account it is ordered in some plasters; a supposition, we fear, which is not warranted by experience. It is found in long, thick, and irregularly cylindric pieces, which are in general hollow, but sometimes filled up with a marly earth, and sometimes contain within them the remains of a stick, round which the osteocolla had been formed; but though it is plain from thence that many pieces of osteocolla have been formed by incrustations round sticks, yet the greater number are not so, but are irregularly tubular, and appear to be formed of a flat cake, rolled up in a cylindric shape. The crusts of which these are composed do not form regular concentric circles round the internal cavity, as must have been the case had they been formed by incrustation. On the other hand, they plainly show that they were once so many thin strata, composing a flat surface, which has afterwards been rolled up, as one might do a paper three or four times doubled, into two, three, or moral spiral lines; in which case, each single edge of the paper would be everywhere a regular point of a continued spiral line drawn from a given point; but they would by no means be so many detached concentric circles. The osteocolla is found of different sizes, from that of a crow-quill to the thickness of a man's arm. It is composed of sand and earth, which may be separated by washing the powdered osteocolla with water, and is found both in digging and in several brooks, in many parts of Germany, and elsewhere. It is called hammotheus in many parts of Germany. It has this name in these places from its always growing in land, never in clay, or any solid soil, nor even in gravel. Where a piece of it anywhere appears on the surface, they dig down for it, and find the branches run ten or twelve feet deep. They usually run straight down, but sometimes they are found spreading into many parts near the surface, as if it were a subterraneous tree, whose main stem began at 12 feet depth, and thence grew up in a branched manner till met by the open air. The main trunk is usually as thick as a man's leg, and the branches that grow out from it are thickest near the trunk, and thinner as they separate from it. The thinnest are about the size of a man's finger. The people employed to collect it, when they cannot find any mark of it on the surface, search after the spots of white or little lumps of whitish soft matter, which they find lying in various parts on the top of the sand. These always lead them either to a bed of perfect osteocolla, or to some in the formation. If they miss of it, they still find a substance like rotten wood; which, when traced in its course, is found to proceed from a main trunk, at the depth of that of the osteocolla, and to spread itself into branches in the same manner. The diggers call this substance the flower of osteocolla, or hammotheus.\n\nThe osteocolla found in the earth is at first soft and ductile, but in half an hour's time, if exposed to the air, it becomes as hard as we find it in the shops. The method to take up a perfect piece for a specimen is to open the ground, clear away the sand, and leave it for an hour or thereabouts: in this time it will harden, and may be taken out whole. It is certain, that the osteocolla is produced at this time; for if a pit be cleared of it, there will more grow there in a year or two, only it will be softer, and will not harden so easily in the air as the other. What the rotten substance resembling the decayed branches of trees is, we cannot determine, unless it really be such; but the opinion of the common people, that it is the root of something, is absurd, because its thickest part always lies at the greatest depth, and the branches all run upwards. The osteocolla is a marly spar, which concretions round this matter; but what it is that determines it to concretie nowhere on the same ground but about these branches, it is difficult to say. The rottenness of this substance, which forms the basis of the osteocolla, renders it very liable to moulder and fall away; and hence it is that we usually see the osteocolla hollow. Sometimes it is found solid; but in this case there will be found to have been a vegetable matter serving as its basis, and instead of one branch, it will be found in this case to have concreted about a number of fibres, the remains of which will be found in it on a close examination.

See Anatomy, Part I.\n\nOSTERVALD, JOHN FREDERIC, a famous Protestant divine, was born at Neuchâtel in 1663; and made such rapid progress in his studies, that he became master of arts at Saumur before he was 16 years of age. He afterwards studied at Orleans and at Paris. At his return to Neuchâtel in 1699, he became pastor of the church there; and contracted a strict friendship with the celebrated John Alphonsus Turretin of Geneva, and the illustrious Samuel Werenfels of Basil. The union of these three divines, which was called the Trimvirate of the divines of Switzerland, lasted till his death. Mr Osterwald acquired the highest reputation, by his virtues, his zeal in instructing his disciples, and restoring ecclesiastical\nOSTIA, a town situated at the mouth of the Tiber, about 12 miles to the westward of Rome. It was built by Ancus Martius, the fourth king of Rome, and was called Ostia Tiberina, in the plural number, i.e., the two mouths of the Tiber, which were separated by the Holy Island, an equilateral triangle, whose sides were each of them computed at about two miles. The colony of Ostia was founded immediately beyond the left or southern, and the port immediately beyond the right or northern branch of the river; and the distance between their remains measures something more than two miles on Cingolani's map. In the time of Strabo, the sand and mud deposited by the Tiber had choked the harbour of Ostia; the progress of the same cause has added much to the size of the Holy Island, and gradually left both Ostia and the port at a considerable distance from the shore. The dry channels (fiumi morti), and the large estuaries (lagno di Ponente, de Levante), mark the changes of the river, and the efforts of the sea. Its port was one of the most stupendous works of Roman magnificence, and it was a long time one of the best towns on the coast; but having been destroyed by the Saracens, and the harbour choked up, as mentioned above, it has not been able since to recover itself. Though it be an inconsiderable place, and but poorly inhabited by reason of the badness of the air, yet it is the see of a bishop, who is always deacon of the cardinals, and crowns the Pope. The old Ostia, where are seen the ruins of the ancient harbour, is beyond New Ostia, towards the sea; the latter is but a little cluster of houses, with a small castle. It is 12 miles S.W. of Rome. E. Long. 12. 24. N. Lat. 41. 44. There were fortifications in Ostia, called Saline Ostiensis, as early as the times of Ancus Martius (Livy); from which the Via Salaria, which led to the Sabines, took its name, (Varro). It gave name to one of the gates of Rome, which was called Ostiensis (Ammian).\n\nOSTIACKS, a people of Siberia in Asia. They live upon the banks of the rivers Obi and Yenisey, and on those of some other rivers which fall into these.\n\nThese people are very poor, and very lazy, and in the Ostiack summer-time live molly upon fish. They are of a middle size, with broad faces and noses, and yellowish or red hair. All their garments from top to toe are made of fish skins, for they have neither linen nor woolen; and indeed they might almost as well go naked. Their greatest diversion is hunting; and they go together in crowds, with a weapon like a large knife fastened in a stick. In summer they take and dry the fish which serves them in winter; and when that season begins, they go into the woods with their bows and arrows, their dogs and nets, to kill sables, ermines, bears, reindeer, elks, martens, and foxes. Part of the furs of these is paid as a tax to the emperors of Russia, and the rest are sold at a fixed price to the Russian governors, but sometimes they are allowed to dispose of them to private persons.\n\nThey chiefly live upon venison, wild-fowl, fish, and roots, for they have neither rice nor bread. They drink for the most part water, and it is said they can very well relish a draught of train oil. They are immoderately fond of tobacco, and of swallowing the smoke, which soon intoxicates them. In the winter they build their huts in woods and forests, where they find the greatest plenty of game, and dig deep in the earth to secure themselves from the cold, laying a roof of bark or rushes over their huts, which are often covered with snow. In summer they build above ground on the banks of the rivers, to enjoy the convenience of fishing, and make no difficulty of forsaking their habitations. They have a fort of princes among them, in one of whose houses some European travellers found four wives (a). One of these had a red cloth coat on, and was set off with all sorts of glass beads. There was no other furniture than cradles and chests, made of the bark of trees sewed together. Their beds consisted of wood shavings, almost as soft as feathers, and their children lie naked upon them in cradles. They can neither read nor write, nor do they cultivate the land; and seem totally ignorant of times past. They have neither temples nor priests; and their boats are only made of the bark of trees sewed together. Their religion is Pagan; and they have some little brazen idols, tolerably well cast, representing men and animals, made of wood and earth, all of which are dressed in silks, in the manner of Russian ladies. In general, however, they are ill made, every man being his own carver. They place them on the tops of hills, in groves, and in the pleasantest places their country affords, and sometimes before their huts; yet they have no set time for performing religious worship, but apply to their gods for succours in all their undertakings. As they have no regular priests, every old man may devote himself to that service, and the office is frequently performed by the masters and heads of families. Strahlenberg says, that when he was among them he saw one of their temples, which was built of wood in an oblong form, like a great barn, covered at\n\n(a) They may have as many wives as they please, and make no scruple of marrying their nearest relations. They purchase a wife of her relations for three or four rein-deer, and take as many as they please, returning them again if they do not like them, only losing what they gave for the purchase. Upon the birth of their children some give them the name of the first creature they happen to see afterward. Thus the child has frequently the name of an animal, and you hear a man call his son perhaps Sabatiski, or my little dog; others call their children according to the order of their birth, as First, Second, Third, &c.\nOSTRACISM, in Grecian antiquity, denotes the banishment of such persons whose merit and influence gave umbrage to the people of Athens, lest they should attempt any thing against the public liberty. This punishment was called ostracism, from the Greek word ὀστρακον, which properly signifies a \"shell;\" but when applied to this object, it is used for the billet on which the Athenians wrote the names of the citizens whom they intended to banish. The learned are divided with regard to the substance of which this billet was formed: some insist that it was a small stone, or a piece of brick; some that it was a piece of bark; and others assert, that it was a shell. The word admits most of these interpretations. But what determines its true sense, is the epithet given it by ancient authors, of ceramite melos; which words signify, \"The punishment of potter's clay;\" and this expression seems to us a proof, that the word ὀστρακον, when applied on this occasion, signifies a \"piece of baked earth, in the form of a shell;\" and undoubtedly the Latin authors had this idea of the word here, for they translated it by testula.\n\nThe ancients are likewise divided with regard to the time when ostracism was instituted. But they all agree, that the person who moved the law was its first victim. But as to the name of its patron, and the time of its establishment, they differ extremely. Many are of opinion, that ostracism owes its origin to very remote times.\n\nHowever that be, the punishment of ostracism was inflicted by the Athenians when their liberty was in danger. If, for instance, jealousy or ambition had sowed discord among the chiefs of the republic; and if different parties were formed, which threatened some revolution in the state; the people assembled to propose measures proper to be taken in order to prevent the consequences of a division which in the end might be fatal to freedom. Ostracism was the remedy to which they usually had recourse on these occasions; and the consultations of the people generally terminated with a decree, in which a day was fixed for a particular assembly, when they were to proceed to the sentence of ostracism. Then they who were threatened with banishment, omitted no fidelity or art which might gain them the favour of the people. They made harangues to evince their innocence, and the great injustice that would be done them if they were banished. They solicited, in person, the interest of every citizen; all their party exerted themselves in their behalf: they procured informers to vilify the chiefs of the opposite faction. Some time before the meeting of the assembly, a wooden inclosure was raised in the forum, with ten doors, i.e., with as many as there were tribes in the republic; and when the appointed day was come, the citizens of each tribe entered at their respective door, and threw into the middle of the inclosure the small brick on which the citizen's name was written whose banishment they voted. The archons and the senate presided at this assembly, and counted the billets. He who was condemned by 6000 of his fellow citizens, was obliged to quit the city within ten days; for 6000 voices, at least, were requisite to banish an Athenian by the ostracism.\n\nThe Athenians, without doubt, foresaw the inconveniences to which this law was subject; but they chose rather, as Cornelius Nepos hath remarked, sometimes to expose the innocent to an unjust censure, than to live in continual alarms. Yet as they were sensible that the injustice of confounding virtue and vice would have been too flagrant, they softened, as much as they could, the rigour of ostracism. It was not aggravated with the circumstances which were most dishonourable and shocking in the ordinary mode of exile. They did not confiscate the goods of those who were banished by ostracism. They enjoyed the produce of their effects in the places into which they were banished; and they were banished only for a certain time. But in the common banishment, the goods of the exiles were always confiscated, and no hopes were given them of ever returning to Athens.\nThe scholiast of Aristophanes informs us of a third difference betwixt ostracism and the common banishment. He says, that a particular place of retirement was assigned to those who were banished by ostracism, which was not appointed to the other exiles. We suspect, however, the truth of this observation; for Themistocles was certainly not limited in his banishment. That great man, as we are told by Thucydides, though his chief residence was at Argi, travelled over all the Peloponnesus.\n\nThis punishment, far from conveying the idea of infamy, became, at Athens, a proof of merit, by the objects on which it was inflicted; as Aristides the sophist justly observes, in his second declamation against the Gorgias of Plato, where he says, that ostracism was not an effect of the vindictive spirit of the people against those whom it condemned; that the law, whether good or bad, (for he enters not into an examination of the question,) was only meant to prune the luxuriant growth of transcendent merit; that it condemned to an exile of ten years, only those illustrious men who were accused of being exalted far above other citizens by their conspicuous virtue; and that none of that public indignation was shown to the exiles by ostracism, which commonly breaks out against criminals.\n\nSuch were the mitigations with which this law was introduced among the Athenians: and by them we see that they were sensible of all the inconveniences to which it was subject. They were indeed too enlightened a people, not to foresee the many instances of injustice which it might produce; that if in some respects it would be favourable to liberty, in others it would be its enemy, by condemning citizens without allowing them a previous defence, and by making a capricious and envious people arbiters of the fate of great men; that it might even become pernicious to the state, by depriving it of its best subjects, and by rendering the administration of public affairs an odious employment to men of capital talents and virtue.\n\nHowever great the inconveniences of ostracism were, it would not have been impossible to avoid them; and we may add, that this law would have been of service to the state, if the people by whom it was instituted had always had discernment enough only to give it force on such occasions as endangered liberty. But its fate was like that of almost all other laws which the wisest legislators have planned for the good of communities. Defined by their intuition to maintain order, to repress injustice, and to protect innocence, men have found ways to pervert their application, and have made them instruments to gratify their private passions. Thus ostracism was established to prevent the dangerous enterprises of the great, and to preserve the vigour of the democracy; but the people of Athens, naturally jealous and envious, exerted that law, to remove men of eminent merit from the state, by whose presence they were reproved and intimidated. The fear of tyranny was commonly but a specious pretext with which they veiled their malignity. The repeated victories which they had gained over the Persians, had rendered them, says Plutarch, proud and insolent. Intoxicated with their prosperity, they arrogated all its glory to themselves; they were jealous of those citizens whose political and military talents were the subjects of public eulogium. They thought the glory acquired by great men diminished their own reputation.\n\nAn Athenian no sooner distinguished himself by a splendid action, than he was marked out as a victim by public envy. His reputation was a sufficient reason for his banishment.\n\nOSTRACITES, in Natural History, a name used for the foxtail oysters, common in many parts of England. They are of various shapes and kinds; and the name is by some authors made to signify the shell itself, when preserved in its native state and condition; as is the case with those about Woolwich and Blackheath; and by others, the stones cast or formed in those shells, or in cavities from whence they have been washed away.\n\nOSTREA, the oyster, a genus of shell fish belonging to the order of vermes testacea.

It was purchased in 1410 by the republic of Venice, for 5000 ducats, and some pieces of land besides. Its fortresses, which was seated on a rock, perpendicularly cut all round, and deservedly reckoned impregnable before the use of artillery, was taken by Soliman in 1524, but soon after restored to the dominion of Venice. At present, no traces of its fortification remain, and it is only a bare and isolated mass.\n\nOSTUNI, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the Terra di Otranto, with a bishop's see.

It is a place celebrated in Saxon history and legendary piety. On this spot, August 5, 612, was fought the battle between the Christian Oswald, king of the Northumbrians, and the pagan Penda, king of the Mercians, in which Oswald was defeated, and lost his life. The barbarian victor cut the body of the slain prince in pieces, and flung them on stakes dispersed over the field as so many trophies; but, according to others, his head and hands only were thus exposed. A prince so dear to the church as Oswald, and so attached to the professors of the monastic life, received every posthumous honour they could bestow. He was raised to the rank of a saint, and his sanctity confirmed by numberless miracles, which are too numerous and too trifling to admit of particular description. Its church, which is of no great antiquity, was formerly a monastery, and was called Blanclminter. It is, however, spacious, and has a handsome plain tower. In the years 1542 and 1567, this town suffered much by fire. It is governed by two bailiffs, burgesses, &c., and once had a great trade in Welch cottons and flannels.\nOSYOTA\n\nOf mandes nels; but this is now much decayed. There is now scarcely a tolerable house for travellers. But besides a good grammar school, it is noted for an excellent charity-school for 40 boys, besides girls, which has the best methods for exciting the emulation of the children in their learning; for 20 of the boys are set to strive against 20 others for shoes, and the 20 who perform their task best have shoes first; then 10 of the boys are set against 10 others for the like premium, and so on till they are all dead: so in the girls school a list is put up for the best spinner, a head-dress for the best sempstress, a pair of stockings for the best knitter, a Bible for the best reader, and a copy-book for the best writer. In the wall with which the town was fortified there were four gates. That called the Black gate is demolished; the New-gate, Willow-gate, and the Beatrice-gate, still remain. The list is a handsome building, with a guard-room on both sides. There are only two fragments of the cattle remaining. It stood on an artificial mount, surrounded by a fosse, extending to the Willow-gate.\n\nOSYMANDES, a famous king of Egypt, was, according to some authors, the first monarch who collected a great number of books for the purpose of forming a library. To this curious collection he gave the title of Pharmacy of the Soul. Of all the monuments of the kings of Thebes, that of Osymandes is one of the most magnificent. \"He appears (says an elegant author) to have been a prince of great elegance and taste in his day.\" Diodorus Siculus describes many sumptuous edifices erected by him; among those edifices his palace or mausoleum, whichever it was, has been eminently distinguished for the paintings and sculptures with which it was adorned. When we look to the subjects of those works, we shall have reason to think that no man in any age could discover a fairer and more enlightened judgement than he did in the employment of the genius around him, which was not tamely devoted to dull or contracted objects, nor lavished on scenes of savage life, nor wholly engrossed in allusions to himself, but sensibly enlarged to a variety of contemplation which might become a great sovereign; and in each of those parts the subject was characteristically great.\n\n* Diod. Sic. * In one place was represented, in a multitude of sculptures, his expedition against the Bactrians, a people of Asia, whom he had invaded with 400,000 foot, and 20,000 horse, and whom he conquered. In another part was displayed the variety of fruits and productions, with which Pan, the great source of all things, had enriched the fertile land over which Osymandes reigned. A third group of figures represented the monarch himself, as the high priest of the country, offering to the gods the gold and silver which he drew every year from the mines of Egypt. In another part of the edifice was exhibited, in an infinite number of figures, an assembly of judges, in the midst of a great audience attentive to their decisions; the president or chief of those judges, surrounded by many books, wore on his breast a picture of Truth with her eyes shut—those emphatic emblems, beyond which no age could go for the impressment of that wisdom and impartiality which ought to prevail in administrative justice.\n\nIn short, we cannot without astonishment read the account which Diodorus Siculus gives of the almost incredible magnificence of this prince, and of the immense sums which he spent upon those grand works. Amongst a variety of other surprising curiosities, was to be seen Osymandes a statue in the attitude of sitting, which was the largest in all Egypt, the length of one of the feet being seven cubits. Not only the art of the sculptor, but also the beauty of the stone, which was perfect in its kind, contributed to render this a masterpiece of sculpture. It bore the following inscription: I am OSYMANDES, king of kings; whosoever will dispute with me this title, let him surpass me in any of my works.\n\nIndeed (to use the words of the same elegant author quoted above) \"the palace or mausoleum of this accomplished prince must give us a striking assurance of the progress which had been made in the arts at that time; whether he lived, as some have thought, the immediate successor of the first Bufris, which was some time ago somewhat later than the period of Semiramis; or, as others have conceived, subsequent to Selophis, which would be 400 years later. Diodorus Siculus, who describes that edifice, says nothing of the age in which Osymandes lived; every opinion, therefore, on that point must be conjecture. We shall only remark, that there is nothing in the works of art in that edifice which should appear too much for the earliest age in which that monarch has been placed, when we look back to what was done of those works in a period full as early by Semiramis in Assyria.\"\n\nOTACOUSTIC INSTRUMENT, or Auricular Tube, an instrument to facilitate the hearing. See Acoustics.\n\nOTAHEITE, a celebrated island of the South sea, situated in W. Long. 149. 13. S. Lat. 17. 46. It was discovered by Captain Wallis in 1767; afterwards Mr Bougainville touched here; and it was visited by Captain Cook in 1773 and 1774, who had in 1769 sailed round the island in a boat to observe the transit of Venus.\n\nThe island consists of two distinct kingdoms, which are united by a narrow neck of land; the larger being called by the natives Tiarrabou, or O-Tahitie Nui; the smaller one Opourenon, or O-Tahitie-Ete. The circumference of both islands is about 50 leagues; the larger kingdom being divided into 43 districts. The country has a delightful romantic appearance. The shape of the coast, viewed from the sea, presents a most beautiful country, precipice, being elevated like an amphitheatre. The island is skirted with a reef of rocks, and towards the sea is level, being covered with fruit trees of various kinds, particularly the cocoa-nut. At the distance of about three miles from the shore, the country rises into lofty hills that are covered with wood, and terminate in peaks, from which large rivers are precipitated into the sea. The stones everywhere appear to have been burnt, not one being found which did not give manifest signs of fire; so that there is great reason for supposing that this and the neighbouring islands are either the shattered remains of a continent, or were torn from rocks, which from the creation of the world have been the bed of the sea, and thrown up in heaps to a height which the waters never reach. What is further extraordinary, the water does not gradually grow shallow as we approach the shore, but is of immense depth close by the land; and the islands in this neighbourhood are almost everywhere surrounded by reefs which appear to be rude and broken in the manner that some violent concussion would naturally leave the solid substance of the\nOtaheite, the earth; and Mr Forster saw a rock with projecting longitudinal angles of black compact basaltites. The exterior ranges of hills are sometimes entirely barren, and contain a great quantity of yellowish clay, mixed with iron ochre; but others are covered with mould and wood like the mountains in the internal parts of the country. Pieces of quartz are sometimes met with here; but no indications of precious minerals or metals of any kind have been observed, iron only excepted.\n\nThe air is extremely healthy and pleasant; the heat is not troublesome; and fresh meat will keep very well for two days, and fish one day. The winds do not blow constantly from the east, but generally a little breeze from east to south-west-east. The tide rises very little; and, being governed by the winds, is very uncertain. \"The climate,\" says M. Bougainville, \"is so healthy, that notwithstanding the hard labour of the ships companies while on shore, though the men were continually in the water, and exposed to the meridian sun, though they slept upon the bare soil, and in the open air, none of them fell sick; those who were afflicted with the fever, and were sent on shore, regained their strength; although they were obliged to assist in the erection of a fort, and had scarce one uninterrupted night, yet they were so far recovered in the short space of time they continued there, that they were afterwards perfectly cured on board.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the great height of the inland mountains of Otaheite, none of their rocks have the appearance of barrenness, every one of them being covered with woods. \"We hardly believed our eyes,\" says M. de Bougainville, \"when we saw a peak covered with woods up to its highest summit, which rises above the level of the mountains in the interior parts of the southern quarter of this island. Its apparent size seemed to be more than 30 leagues in diameter, and grew less in breadth as it rose higher. At a distance it might have been taken for a pyramid of immense height, which the hand of an able sculptor had adorned with garlands and foliage.\" One of the mates of the Dolphin, with a party of marines and seamen, penetrated into the interior parts of the island; and having ascended, with great difficulty, a mountain which they supposed to be a mile high, they discovered mountains before them so much higher, that with respect to them they seemed to be in a valley: towards the sea the view was enchanting, the sides of the hills were beautifully clothed with wood, villages were everywhere interspersed, and the valleys between them afforded a still richer prospect; the houses stood thicker, and the verdure was more luxuriant; and Mr Forster, with other gentlemen, ascended to the summit of one of the highest mountains in the island, from whence they had a prospect of the island of Huahine, and some others lying at the distance of 40 leagues; from which we may form some judgement of the prodigious height of that mountain. The view of the fertile plain below them, and of a river making innumerable meanders, was delightful in the highest degree. The vegetation on the upper part of the mountains was luxuriant, and the woods consisted of many unknown sorts of trees and plants.\n\nThe soil of this island is a rich fat earth, of a blackish colour. It produces spontaneously, or with the slightest culture imaginable, a great variety of the most excellent fruits; such as bread-fruit, cocoa nuts, bananas of 13 forts, plantains, potatoes, yams, a fruit known here by the name of jambu, and reckoned most delicious; sugar-canes, which the inhabitants eat raw; ginger; turmeric; a root of the false kind, called by the inhabitants pea; a plant called elaeo, of which the root only is eaten; a fruit that grows in a pod like that of a large kidney bean, by the natives called alae; a tree called waiwai, which produces fruit something like the pine-apple, and which is known in the East Indies by the name of pandanus; a shrub called nono; the morinda, which also produces fruit; a species of fern; a plant called thoe; and the Chinese paper-mulberry, of the bark of which they make their cloth; an herb which the inhabitants eat raw, its flavour somewhat resembling that of the West India spinach called callion, but its leaf very different; a plant which the natives call ava or eava, from the root of which they extract a liquor, which, if drank to excess, intoxicates like wine or distilled spirits. Here are a fort of shady trees covered with a dark green foliage, bearing golden-coloured apples, which, in juiciness and flavour, resemble the ananas or pine-apple. One of the most beautiful trees in the world received here the name of Barringtonia; it had a great abundance of flowers larger than lilies, and perfectly white, excepting the tips of their numerous chives, which were of a deep crimson. Such a quantity of these flowers were seen dropped off, that the ground underneath the tree was entirely covered with them. The natives called the tree buddow; and said, that the fruit, which is a large nut, when bruised and mixed up with some shell-fish, and thrown into the sea, intoxicates the fish for some time, so that they come to the surface of the water, and suffer themselves to be taken with people's hands. Several other maritime plants in tropical climates are found to have the same quality. Mr Dalrymple describes the method of catching fish with these plants as follows: the plant is thrust under the coral rocks or hollows where the fish haunt; the effect is most sensible in still water, though it is effectual in the open sea; for the same gentleman says, he has seen fish soon after float on the surface of the water half dead, and some totally without life; and where the effect is let's violent, the fish will be seen under the water to have lost their pois, without coming up to the surface. Fish caught in this manner are not in the least noxious or ill-tasted.\n\nIn this island they have domestic poultry exactly resembling those of Europe; besides which there are wild ducks; also beautiful green turtle doves; large pigeons of a deep blue plumage and excellent taste; a small sort of paroquets, very singular on account of the various mixture of red and blue in their feathers; also another sort of a greenish colour, with a few red spots; the latter are frequently tamed, and are valued on account of their red feathers. Here is a kingfisher of a dark green, with a collar of the same hue round his white throat; a large cuckoo, and a blue heron. Small birds of various kinds dwell in the shady trees; and, contrary to the generally received opinion that birds in warm climates are not remarkable for their song, have a very agreeable note. There were no quadrupeds but dogs, hogs, and rats; and for these last the natives were said to have a scrupulous regard, inasmuch that they would by no means kill them; however,\nhowever, Captain Cook, in 1773, turned about 14 cats on the island, which have probably reduced the number of these vermin. No frogs, toads, scorpions, centipedes, or any kind of serpent, have been found here; the ants, however, are troublesome, but not very numerous. When the Endeavour first arrived here in 1769, the flies were found excessively troublesome; but mosquito nets and fly-flaps in some measure removed the inconvenience. Sydney Parkinson, in his journal, says, that notwithstanding these flies are so great a nuisance, the natives, from a religious principle, will not kill them. But there is a strange disagreement in the accounts of different voyagers concerning this matter. For M. Bougainville says, \"this island is not infested with those myriads of troublesome insects that are the plague of other tropical countries.\" And Mr Forster says, \"not a gnat or mosquito hummed unpleasantly about us, or made us apprehensive of its bite.\" This inconvenience must therefore be felt at certain seasons of the year, and in certain districts of the country, more sensibly than at other times and places. There is great variety of excellent fish; and according to Aitourou, a native who embarked with M. de Bougainville, there are sea-snakes on the shore of Otaheite, whose bite is mortal.\n\nThe inhabitants of Otaheite are a stout, well-made, active, and comely people. The stature of the men, in general, is from five feet seven to five feet ten inches; the tallest man seen by Captain Wallis measured five feet three inches and a half; and Captain Cook, in his second voyage, describes O-Too, the king of Otaheite, to be of that height. \"In order to paint a Hercules or a Mars,\" says M. de Bougainville, \"one could nowhere find such beautiful models.\" They are of a pale brown complexion; in general their hair is black, and finely frizzled; they have black eyes, flat noses, large mouths, and fine white teeth; the men wear their beards in many fashions, all of them plucking out a great part, and have prominent bellies. Most of them smell strong of the cocoa-nut oil. The women in general are much smaller, especially those of the lower rank or tawtows, which is attributed to their early and promiscuous intercourse with the men; whilst the better sort, who do not gratify their passions in the same unbridled manner, are above the middle stature of Europeans. Their skin is most delicately smooth and soft; they have no colour in their cheeks; their nose is generally somewhat flat, but their eyes are full of expression, and their teeth beautifully even and white. \"The women,\" says M. de Bougainville, \"have features not less agreeable than the generality of Europeans, and a symmetry of body and beautiful proportion of limbs which might vie with any of them. The complexion of the men is tawny; but those who go upon the water are much more red than those who live on shore. Some have their hair brown, red, or flaxen, in which they are exceptions to all the natives of Asia, Africa, and America, who have their hair black universally; here, in the children of both sexes, it is generally flaxen. The strongest expression is painted in the countenances of these people; their walk is graceful, and all their motions are performed with great vigour and ease.\" \"I never beheld statelier men,\" says Sydney Parkinson.) The men of consequence on the island wear the nails of their fingers long, which they consider as a very honourable badge of distinction, since only such people as have no occasion to work can suffer them to grow to that length. This custom they have in common with the Chinese; but the nail of the middle finger on the right hand is always kept short, the meaning for which peculiarity could not be learned. Only one single cripple was met with among them, and he appeared to have been maimed by a fall. The women always cut their hair short round their heads. Both sexes have a custom of staining their bodies, which they call tattooing; both men and women have the hinder part of their thighs and loins marked very thick with black lines in various forms; these marks are made by striking the teeth of an instrument somewhat like a comb just through the skin, and rubbing into the punctures a kind of paste made of root and oil, which leaves an indelible stain. The boys and girls under twelve years of age are not marked; a few of the men, whose legs were marked in chequers by the same method, appeared to be persons of superior rank and authority. Mr Banks saw the operation of tattooing performed upon the backside of a girl about thirteen years old. The instrument used upon this occasion had thirty teeth; and every stroke, of which at least a hundred were made in a minute, drew an ichor or serum a little tinged with blood. The girl bore it with most stoical resolution for about a quarter of an hour; but the pain of so many hundred punctures as she had received in that time, then became intolerable. She first complained in murmurs, then wept, and at last burst into loud lamentations, earnestly imploring the operator to desist. He was, however, inexorable; and when she began to struggle, she was held down by two women, who sometimes soothed and sometimes chid her; and now and then, when she was most unruly, gave her a smart blow. Mr Banks stood in a neighbouring house an hour, and the operation was not over when he went away; yet it was performed but upon one side, the other having been done some time before; and the arches upon the loins, in which they most pride themselves, and which gave more pain than all the rest, were still to be done. Both men and women are not only decently but gracefully clothed, in a kind of white cloth that is made of the bark of a thurb, and very much resembles coarse China paper. Their dress consists of two pieces of this cloth; one of them, having a hole made in the middle to put the head through, hangs from the shoulders to the mid-leg before and behind; another piece, which is between four and five yards long, and about one yard broad, they wrap round the body in a very easy manner: This cloth is not woven; but is made like paper, of the macerated fibres of the inner bark spread out and beaten together. Their ornaments are feathers, flowers, pieces of shell, and pearls; the pearls are worn chiefly by the women. In wet weather they wear matting of different kinds, as their cloth will not bear wetting. The dress of the better sort of women consists of three or four pieces: one piece, about two yards wide and eleven long, they wrap several times round their waist, so as to hang down like a petticoat as low as the middle of the leg; and this they call parou. This simple drapery affords the sex an opportunity of displaying an elegant figure to the greatest advantage, according to the talents and taste of the wearer: no general fashions force them to disfigure instead of adorning themselves, but an innate gracefulness is the companion of simplicity.\nOTA\n\nsimplicity. To this cloth they give a very strong perfume.\n\nThe chief use which they make of their houses is to sleep in them; for unless it rains, they eat in the open air under the shade of a tree. These houses are no other than sheds, all built in the wood between the sea and the mountains; they are erected on an oblong square; their width is nearly half of their length; they are nothing more than a roof, not quite four feet from the ground, raised on three rows of pillars, one row on each side, and one in the middle. The roof resembles our thatched houses in England, and consists of two flat sides inclining to each other. Their thatch consists of palm-leaves. The floor of their dwelling is covered with hay, over which they spread mats. Some of these erections are furnished with a stool, which is appropriated solely to the use of the master of the family: they consist of no other furniture except a few blocks of wood, which being square, one side is hollowed into a curve; and these they use as pillows, and with their apparel they cover themselves. In these open dwellings the whole family repose themselves at night. The size of the house is proportioned to the number that constitutes the family. The established order in these dormitories is, for the master and his wife to sleep in the middle; round them the married people; in the next circle the unmarried women; and in the next, at the same distance, the unmarried men; and the servants at the extremity of the shed; but in fair weather the latter sleep in the open air. Some few dwellings, however, constructed for greater privacy, are entirely inclosed with walls of reeds, connected together with transverse pieces of wood, so as to appear somewhat like large bird cages closely lined; in these houses there is commonly a hole left for the entrance, which can be closed up with a board.\n\nTheir candles are made of the kernels of a kind of oily nut, which they stick one above another in a skewer that is thrust through the middle of them; the upper one being lighted burns to the second, at the same time consuming that part of the skewer that goes through it; the second taking fire burns in the same manner down to the third, and so to the last; they burn a considerable time, and afford a pretty good light. The natives generally retire to rest about an hour after it is dark.\n\nThe food of the common people entirely consists of vegetables. These are, the bread-fruit, with bananas, plantains, yams, apples, and a fruit, which, though not pleasant by itself, gives an agreeable relish to roasted bread-fruit, with which it is frequently beaten up. The flesh, which is reserved for the tables of the great, is either poultry, hogs, or dogs; the flesh of their fowls is not well-taught, but that of dogs is esteemed by the natives beyond pork. The smaller fish are generally eaten raw, as we eat oysters: every thing that can be procured from the sea is made an article of their food; for they will eat not only sea-insects, but what the seamen call blubber, though some of them are so tough that they are obliged to suffer them to become putrid before they can be chewed. A very large shark being caught by the Dolphin's people was given to the natives; who soon cut it to pieces, and carried it away with great satisfaction.\n\nThey kill the animals they intend for food by suffocating them, which is done by flopping the mouth and nose with their hands; they then finger off the hair, by holding the animal over a fire, and scraping him with a shell: with this instrument they cut him up, and take out the entrails; which are washed, and put into cocoa-nut shells, together with the blood. Dogs are eaten that are fed wholly upon bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables, and are never suffered to taste any animal food; and those who have tasted the flesh of a dog thus fed, have declared it to be little inferior to English lamb. In order to dress their food, they kindle a fire, by rubbing the end of one piece of dry wood upon the side of another, in the same manner as a carpenter with us whets a chisel. They then dig a pit about half a foot deep, and two or three yards in circumference; they pave the bottom with large pebble stones, which they lay down very smooth and even, and then kindle a fire in it with dry wood, leaves, and the hulls of cocoa-nuts. When the stones are sufficiently heated, they take out the embers, and rake up the ashes on every side; they then cover the stones with a layer of green cocoa-nut leaves, and wrap up the animal that is to be dressed in the leaves of the plantain. If it is a small hog, they wrap it up whole; if a large one, they split it. When it is placed in the pit, they cover it with the hot embers, and lay upon them bread-fruit and yams, which are also wrapped up in the leaves of plantain. Over these they spread the remainder of the embers, mixing among them some of the hot stones, with more cocoa-nut tree leaves upon them, and then close up all with earth, so that the heat is kept in; the oven is kept thus closed a longer or shorter time according to the size of the meat that is dressed. The meat, when taken out, is said to be better dressed than any other way. They use shells for knives; and carve very dexterously with them, always cutting from themselves. One of the principal attendants on Oberea, attempting the use of the knife and fork, could not feed himself therewith; but by the mere force of habit, his hand came to his mouth, and the victuals at the end of his fork went away to his ear.\n\nThey are quite unacquainted with the method of boiling water, as they leave no vessels among them that will bear the fire. Whilst the noble Oberea was one morning at breakfast with Captain Wallis on board the Dolphin, the surgeon filled the tea-pot by turning the cock of a vase that stood upon the table. One of the lady's attendants observed this practice very attentively, and soon after turning the cock himself, received the water upon his hand; he no sooner felt himself scalded, than he roared and danced about in an extravagant manner. The other Indians, unapprised of the cause of these emotions, stood gazing at him in amazement, and not without some mixture of terror: but the gentlemen in company, who soon perceived the cause of the outcry, dispelled the apprehensions of their victims; and some ointment being applied to the scald, good humour and confidence were again restored. The gunner of the ship, who was appointed comptroller of the market which was established on shore with the natives, used to dine on the spot; the astonishment of these people was very great to see him dress his pork and poultry in a pot; at length an old man, who was extremely serviceable in bringing down provisions to be exchanged, was put into possession of an iron pot, and from that\ntime he and his friends ate boiled meat every day. Several iron pots were likewise given to Obera and some of the chiefs; which were in constant use, and drew everybody to see them; but although the particulars of two successive voyages of Captain Cook to this island are circumstantially related, we hear no more of this improvement in the culinary art, or of the further affluence which has been rendered those people in supplying them with pots for boiling; but however deficient the natives might be to eat boiled meat, it was not advisable to have such an article of barter as iron kettles, when a few spike nails, or a common hatchet, would procure one of their largest hogs.\n\nSalt water is the usual sauce to their food; those who live near the sea have it furnished as it is wanted, others at a distance keep it in large bamboos. The kernels of the cocoa-nuts furnish them with another sauce: these, made into a paste something of the consistence of butter, are beat up with salt water, which has a very strong flavour; but though at first it seemed very nauseous, yet when the taste became familiar, it was much relished.\n\nTheir general drink is water, or the milk of the cocoanut. They showed in general an aversion to strong liquors; and whenever any one of them happened to drink too freely with any of the ship's company as to be intoxicated, he resolutely refused to taste any thing that was likely to produce the same effect again; but they have a plant which they call ava ava, from the root of which they procure a liquor which has an exhilarating quality. Their manner of preparing this strong drink is as simple as it is disgusting to an European. Several of the people take some of the root, and chew it till it is soft and pulpy; they then spit it out into a platter or other vessel, every one into the same: into this general receptacle water is poured according to the quantity prepared. The juice thus diluted is strained through some fibrous stuff like fine shavings, after which it is fit for drinking, and it is always prepared for present use: it has a peppery taste; drinks flat, and rather insipid; and though it intoxicates, yet Captain Cook saw but one instance where it had that effect, as the natives generally drink it with great moderation, and but little at a time. Sometimes they chew this root as Europeans do tobacco, and sometimes they will eat it wholly.\n\nThey eat alone, or at least only in company with a guest that happens to call in; and the men and women never sit down together to a meal: the shade of a spreading tree leaves them for a parlour; broad leaves spread in great abundance serve for a table-cloth; and if a person of rank, he is attended by a number of servants who seat themselves round him: before he begins his meal, he washes his mouth and hands very clean, and repeats this several times whilst he is eating. The quantity of food which these people eat at a meal is prodigious. Captain Cook says, he has seen one man devour two or three fishes as big as a peach; three bread-fruits, each bigger than two fists; 14 or 15 plantains, or bananas, each six or seven inches long and four or five round, and near a quart of the pounded bread-fruit. Men of rank are constantly fed by their women; and one of the chiefs who dined on board the ships in 1769, showed such reluctance to feed himself, that one of the servants was obliged to feed him to prevent his returning without his meal. In one of the excursions which the gentlemen of the ships made into the country in 1773, they arrived at a neat house, where a very fat man, who seemed to be a chief of the district, was lounging on his wooden pillow; before him two servants were preparing his dinner, by beating up with water some bread-fruit and bananas in a large wooden bowl, and mixing with it a quantity of fermented sour paste called mathe. While this was doing, a woman, who sat down near him, crammed down his throat by handfuls the remains of a large baked fish, and several bread-fruits, which he swallowed with a voracious appetite: his countenance was the picture of phlegmatic indifferency, and seemed to testify that all his thoughts centered in the gratification of his appetite. He scarce deigned to look at the strangers; and a few monosyllables which he uttered, were extorted from him to remind his feeders of their duty, when by gazing at them they grew less attentive to him.\n\nThat these people, who are remarkably fond of society, and particularly that of their women, should exclude its pleasures from the table, where, among all other nations, whether civil or savage, they have been principally enjoyed, is truly inexplicable. How a meal, which everywhere else brings families and friends together, comes to separate them here, was a singularity much inquired about, but never accounted for. \"They ate alone (they said), because it was right;\" but why it was right to eat alone, they never attempted to explain. Such, however, was the force of habit in this instance, as it is in every other, that they expressed the strongest dislike, and even disgust, at their visitants eating in society, especially with women, and of the same viands. \"At first (says Captain Cook) we thought this strange singularity arose from some superstitious opinion; but they constantly affirmed the contrary. We observed also some caprices in the custom, for which we could as little account as the custom itself. We could never prevail with any of the women to partake of the viands at our table, when we were dining in company; yet they would go five or six together into the servants' apartments, and there eat very heartily of whatever they could find: nor were they in the least disconcerted if we came in while they were doing it. When any of us have been alone with a woman, she has sometimes eaten in our company; but then she has expressed the greatest unwillingness that it should be known, and always extorted the strongest promises of secrecy. Among themselves, even two brothers and two sisters have each their separate baskets of provisions, and the apparatus of their meal. When they first visited us at our tents, each brought his basket with him; and when we sat down to table, they would go out, sit down upon the ground, at two or three yards' distance from each other, and turning their faces different ways take their repast without exchanging a single word. The women not only abstain from eating with the men, and of the same viands, but even have their viands separately prepared by boys kept for that purpose, who deposit it in a separate dish, and attend them with it at their meals. But though they would not eat with us, or with each other, they have often asked us to eat with them, when we have visited those with whom we were particularly acquainted at their houses; and we have often upon such occasions been invited to partake of their viands, which we have always accepted with pleasure.\"\nOtaheite. Such occasions eaten out of the same basket, and drank out of the same cup. The elder women, however, always appeared offended at this liberty; and if we happened to touch their victuals, or even the basket that contained it, they would throw it away.\n\nAfter meals, and in the heat of the day, the middle-aged people of the better sort generally sleep. They are indeed extremely indolent; and sleeping and eating are almost all that they do. Those that are older are less drowsy, and the boys and girls are kept awake by the natural activity and sprightliness of their age.\n\nThese islanders, who inhabit huts exposed to all the winds, and hardly cover the earth, which serves them for a bed, with a layer of leaves, are remarkably healthy and vigorous, and live to an old age without enduring any of its infirmities; their senses are acute, and they retain their beautiful teeth to the last. M. de Bougainville describes an old man, whom they saw on their landing, who had no other character of old age, than that respectable one which is imprinted on a fine figure. His head was adorned with white hair, and a long white beard; all his body was nervous and flethly; he had neither wrinkles, nor showed any other tokens of decrepitude. This venerable man seemed displeased at the arrival of these strangers; he even retired without making any returns to the courtesies they paid to him; but he gave no signs either of fear, astonishment, or curiosity: very far from taking any part in the raptures which the multitude expressed, his thoughtful and suspicious air seemed to indicate, that he feared the arrival of a new race of men would interrupt the happiness he had so long enjoyed. From whence it may be inferred, that his mind was not a whit more impaired than his body. There are, however, several sorts of eruptive complaints on this island, which appear in cutaneous eruptions of the scaly kind; some were seen that had ulcers upon different parts of their bodies; yet they seemed little regarded by those who were afflicted with them, and no application whatever was used to them, not so much as to keep off the flies. But instances of them are rare, as the excellency of their climate, and the simplicity of their vegetable food, prevent almost all dangerous and deadly disorders. They are sometimes afflicted with the cholick, and coughs are not unknown among them; and the chiefs, who fare more sumptuously, as a punishment for their voluptuousnesses are sometimes attacked with a disorder similar to the gout, in which the legs are swelled and excessively painful. M. de Bougainville's surgeon assured him, that he had seen many with marks of the smallpox.\n\nThe usual method employed here to restore the sick to health, is by pronouncing a fet form of words; after which the exorcist applies the leaves of the cocoa-tree plaited to the fingers and toes of the sick; so that nature is left to conflict with the disease, without being assisted with any salutary application of art. But though they seem utterly destitute of medical knowledge, they appear to be no inconsiderable proficient in surgery, which they had an opportunity of proving while the Dolphin lay here. One of the seamen, when on shore ran a large splinter into his foot; and the surgeon not being at hand, one of his comrades endeavored to take it out with a pen-knife; but after putting the poor fellow to a great deal of pain, he was obliged to give it over; an old native, who had been very active and successful in establishing a good understanding between the ship's company and his countrymen, happening to be present, called a man from the other side of the river, who having examined the lacerated foot, fetched a shell from the beach, which he broke to a point with his teeth; with which instrument he laid open the wound, and extracted the splinter. Whilst this operation was performing, the old man went a little way into the wood, and returned with some gum, which he applied to the wound upon a piece of the cloth that was wrapped round him, and in two days time it was perfectly healed. This gum was produced by the apple-tree; the surgeon of the ship procured some of it, and used it as a vulnerary balsam with great success. Captain Cook, in 1769, saw many of the natives with dreadful sores; one man, in particular, whose face was almost entirely destroyed; his nose, including bone, was perfectly flat; and one cheek and one eye were so beaten in, that the hollow would almost receive a man's fist; yet no ulcer remained.\n\nThe venereal disease is said to have been entailed upon these people by the crew of M. de Bougainville's ships, who visited this island a short time after Captain Wallis had left it. In 1769, more than one-half of the crew in Captain Cook's ship had contracted it, during a month's stay here. The natives distinguished it by a name of the same import with rottenness, but of a more extensive signification. They described, in the most pathetic terms, the sufferings which the first victims to its rage endured; and told him that it caused the hair and the nails to fall off, and the flesh to rot from the bones; that it spread an universal terror and consternation among the inhabitants, so that the sick were abandoned by their nearest relations, lest the calamity should spread by contagion, and were left to perish alone in such misery as till then had never been known among them. But there seems to be some reason to hope that they had found out a specific cure for it, as none were seen on whom it had made a great progress; and one who went from the ship infected, returned, after a short time, in perfect health. Both Captain Cook and Mr Forster, in their relations of their voyage in the Resolution, endeavour to establish the opinion, that this scourge of licentiousness was felt in the South sea islands previous to any of the modern voyages that have been made thither, and that it was an indigenous disease there. But if that conclusion be well founded, how comes it, that at all the places where the Resolution touched in 1773, which had before been visited by the Endeavour in 1769, such as New Zealand for instance, the crew, more or less, became infected by their commerce with the women, and not at all so at places which they visited, for the first time, in the Resolution?\n\nThe principal manufactures among the Otaheiteans is their cloth. This is made of the bark of trees, which are of three kinds, viz. the Chinese mulberry-tree, or aoua; the bread-fruit tree, or ooroo; and one that is described by Dr Hawkesworth as resembling the wild fig tree of the West Indies. Of all these the paper mulberry affords the best cloth; what is made from that being both finer, softer, whiter, and better suited to take a colour; the ooroo produces cloth much inferior in contexture; and the last is very coarse, in color.\nOtaheite colour resembling the darkest brown paper; but this last is the only kind that withstands water: (See the article Bank.)—They likewise prepare a red dye; which is made by mixing the yellow juice of a small species of fig, which the natives call matte, with the greenish juice of a sort of fern or bindweed, or of several other plants, which produce a bright crimson: and this the women rub with their hands, if the piece is to be uniformly of a colour; or they make use of a bamboo seed if the piece is to be marked or sprinkled into different patterns. The colour fades very soon, and becomes of a dirty red; but notwithstanding this defect, and its being liable to be spoiled by rain, the cloth thus stained is highly valued, and is worn only by the principal inhabitants of the country. The inhabitants perfume their clothes with certain plants; concerning which, Mr Forster made all possible inquiry. Tahaa, a friendly native, showed him several plants which are sometimes used as substitutes; but the most precious sort, he either could not, or would not, point out: and from the account of Omai it appears that there are no less than 14 different sorts of plants employed for this purpose.\n\nMatting is another Otaheitean manufacture: and in this they are so dexterous, that they produce finer mats than any made in Europe. Rushes, grass, the bark of trees, and the leaves of a plant called wharou, are the materials which they work up for this purpose. Their matting is applied to various uses: the coarser kind is employed for sleeping on in the night, or fitting on through the day; the finer sort is converted into garments in rainy weather, their cloth being soon penetrated by wet. They are very dexterous in making basket and wicker-work; their baskets are of a vast number of different patterns, many of them exceedingly neat; and the making them is an art practised by everyone, both men and women.\n\nInstead of hemp, they make ropes and lines of the bark of a tree; and thus they are provided with fishing nets; the fibres of the cocoa-nut furnish them with thread, with which they fasten the different parts of their canoes, &c. The bark of a nettle which grows in the mountains, and is called oraoua, supplies them with excellent fishing lines, capable of holding any kind of fish; and their hooks are made of mother-of-pearl, to which they fix a tuft of hair, made to resemble the tail of a fish. Instead of making them bearded, the point is turned inwards. They make also a kind of seine of a coarse broad grass, the blades of which are like flags. These they twist and tie together in a loose manner, till the net, which is about as wide as a large sack, is from 60 to 80 fathoms long. This they haul in smooth shoal water; and its own weight keeps it so close to the ground, that scarcely a single fish can escape. They make harpoons of cane, and point them with hard wood; with which they can strike fish more effectually than an European can with one headed with iron.\n\nThe tools used by the Otaheiteans for all their purposes are, an adze made of stone; a chisel or gouge made of bone, generally the bone of a man's arm between the wrist and elbow; a rasp of coral, and the skin of a sting-ray; also coral and sand, as a file or polisher: and with these they fell timber, cleave and polish it, and hew stone. The stone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of basaltic, of a gray or bluish-black colour, not very hard, but of considerable toughness; they are formed of different sizes; some that are intended for felling, weigh from five to eight pounds; others that are used for carving, not more than as many ounces: but it is necessary to sharpen these rude tools almost every minute; for which purpose a cocoa-nut filled full of water and a stone are always at hand. With such tools they generally take up several days in felling a tree; but after it is down, and split into planks, they smooth them very dexterously and expeditiously with their adzes, and can take off a thin coat from a whole plank without making a stroke.\n\nTheir weapons are flings, which they use with great dexterity; pikes headed with the skins of sting-rays; and clubs of about six or seven feet long, made of a very hard wood. Thus armed, they are laid to fight with great obstinacy; and to give no quarter to man, woman, or child, who happens to fall into their hands during the battle, nor for some time afterwards, till their pallion subsides. They have likewise bows and arrows; but the arrows are good for nothing except to bring down a bird, being headed only with stone, and none of them pointed. They have targets of a semicircular form, made of wicker-work, and plaited strings of the cocoa-nut fibres, covered with glossy, bluish-green feathers belonging to a kind of pigeon, and ornamented with many shark's teeth, arranged in three concentric circles.\n\nTheir boats or canoes are of three different sorts. Some are made out of a single tree, and hold from two to six men. These are principally employed in fishing: the others are constructed of planks very dexterously sewed together; they are of different sizes, and will hold from 10 to 50 men: they generally lash two of these together, and set up two masts between them; or if they are single, they have an on-trigger on one side, and only one mast in the middle; and in these vessels they will sail far beyond the sight of land. The third sort seems to be principally designed for pleasure or show. These are very large, but have no sail; and in shape resemble the gondolas of Venice. The middle is covered with a large awning; and some of the people sit upon it, and some under it. The plank of which these vessels are constructed, is made by splitting a tree, with the grain, into as many thin pieces as possible. The boards are brought to the thickness of about an inch, and are afterwards fitted to the boat with the same exactness that might be expected from an expert joiner. To fasten these planks together, holes are bored with a piece of bone, fixed into a stick for that purpose. Through these holes a kind of plaited cordage is passed, so as to hold the planks strongly together. The seams are caulked with dry rushes; and the whole outside of the vessel is painted over with a kind of gummy juice, which supplies the place of pitch.\n\nThe Otaheiteans are a very industrious people, and friendly in their dispositions; but like all other nations, not fully civilized, their passions are extremely violent, and they are very fickle. The manner of fingling out a man here for a chosen friend is by taking off a part of your clothing and putting it upon him. Their usual manner of expressing their respect to strangers, or their\ntheir superiors, at a first meeting, is by uncovering themselves to the middle. They have a custom of saluting those who sneeze, by saying *eudoua-t-eatoua*, \"May the good eatoua awaken you,\" or \"May not the evil eatoua lull you asleep?\"\n\nTheir propensity to theft is very great, inasmuch, that M. Bougainville says, \"even in Europe itself one cannot find more expert thieves than the people of this country;\" and indeed, in all the voyages made by Captain Cook and others, they had abundant experience of this disposition of the natives, which often produced quarrels, and sometimes even fatal effects. In their behaviour they are extremely laconic, almost beyond credibility. A woman of distinction who visited Mr Banks, used the following ceremony on her first approach to the stranger. After laying down several young plantain leaves, a man brought a large bundle of cloth; which having opened, he spread it piece by piece on the ground, in the space between Mr Banks and his visitants. There were in all nine pieces; having spread three pieces one upon another, the lady came forward, and, stepping upon them, took up her garments all around her to her waist; she then turned three times round, after which she dropped the veil: when other three pieces were spread, she practised the same ceremony; and so the third time, when the last three pieces were laid out; after which the cloth was again rolled up, and delivered to Mr Banks as a present from the lady, who with her attending friend came up and saluted him. From the unbridled licentiousness of these people, the French gave this island the name of the New Cythera. Nay, to such a degree do they carry their licentious excesses, that a number of the principal people, it is related, have formed themselves into a society, in which every woman is common to every man. This society is distinguished by the name of *Arreoy*, the members of which have meetings from which all others are excluded. At these meetings the passions are excited by a studied course of sensuality, and the coarsest and most brutal pleasures are enjoyed by the whole company. If, however, notwithstanding these excesses, any of the female members of this community should prove with child, unless she can procure some man to adopt the child as his own, not all the strong affections of a mother, if such are not entirely eradicated by a course of life subversive of the feelings as well as the modesty of nature, can save the life of the precondemned innocent; but the child as soon as born is smothered, and the mother is left at liberty to renew her former course of execrable prostitution. Should any man be found to cooperate with a woman in saving the life of a child, they are both excluded for ever from the *arreoy*, and are considered as man and wife. The woman from that time is distinguished by the term *whanow-now*, \"the bearer of children;\" which in this part of the world only is considered as a term of reproach; and so depraved are those people, that being a member of such a society is boasted of as being a privilege, instead of being stigmatized as the foulest crime. The *arreoy* enjoy several privileges, and are greatly respected throughout the Society Islands, as well as at Otaheite; nay, they claim a great share of honour from the circumstance of being childeful. Tupia, one of the most intelligent natives, when he heard that the king of England had a numerous offspring, declared that Otaheite he thought himself much greater, because he belonged to the *arreoy*. That this society indulge themselves in promiscuous embraces, and that every woman is common to every man, is contradicted by Mr Forster. He says, that these *arreoy* choose their wives and mistresses from among the prostitutes; and from this circumstance, as well as their extreme voluptuousness, they have seldom any reason to dread the intrusion of children. He had the following circumstances related to him by Omi or Omiah, one of the natives, who was brought to England. He said, that the pre-eminence and advantages which a man enjoyed as *arreoy* were so valuable as to urge him against his own feelings to destroy his child; that the mother was never willing to consent to the murder; but that her husband and other *arreoy* persuaded her to yield up the child; and that where entreaties were not sufficient, force was sometimes made use of. But, above all, he added, that this action was always perpetrated in secret; inasmuch, that not even the *totous* or attendants of the house were present; because, if it were seen, the murderers would be put to death.\n\nBoth men and women constantly wash their whole bodies three times a day in running water, and are remarkably cleanly in their clothes. They are most expert swimmers, being accustomed to the water from their infancy. Captain Cook relates the following remarkable instance of their expertise. On a part of the shore where a tremendously high surf broke, inasmuch that no European boat could live in it, and the best European swimmer, he was persuaded, would have been drowned, as the shore was covered with pebbles and large stones, yet here were 10 or 12 Indians swimming for their amusement. Whenever a surf broke near them, they dived under it, and rose again on the other side. The stern of an old canoe added much to their sport. This they took out before them, and swam with it as far as the outermost breach; when two or three getting into it, and turning the square end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the shore with incredible rapidity, sometimes almost to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way; in which case they dived, and rose to the other side with the canoe in their hands, and swimming out with it again, were again driven back. This amazing expertise drew the Captain's attention for more than half an hour; during which time none of the swimmers attempted to come ashore, but seemed to enjoy the sport in the highest degree. At another time, one of the officers of the quarter-deck intending to drop a bead into a canoe for a little boy of six years of age, it accidentally missed the boat, and fell into the sea; but the child immediately leaped overboard, dived after it, and recovered it. To reward him for this feat, some more beads were dropped to him; which excited a number of men and women to amuse the officers with their amazing feats of agility in the water, and not only fetched up several beads scattered at once, but likewise large nails, which, from their weight, descended quickly to a considerable depth. Some of these people continued a considerable time under water; and the velocity with which they were seen to go down, the water being extremely clear, was very surprising. Here a green branch of a tree is used as an emblem of peace,\nin exact conformity to the custom of the ancient nations. We shall add an extract here from Captain Cook's last voyage to the Pacific ocean.\n\n\"Nothing could make a stronger impression at first sight, on our arrival here, than the remarkable contrast between the robust make and dark colour of the people of Tongataboo*, and a sort of delicacy and whiteness which distinguished the inhabitants of Otaheite. It was even some time before that difference could preponderate in favour of the Otaheiteans; and then only, perhaps, because we became accustomed to them, the marks which had recommended the others began to be forgotten. Their women, however, struck us as superior in every respect; and as possessing all those delicate characteristics which distinguish them from the other sex in many countries. The beard which the men here wear long, and the hair, which is not cut so short as is the fashion at Tongataboo, made also a great difference; and we cannot help thinking, that on every occasion they showed a greater degree of timidity and fickleness. The muscular appearance, so common amongst the Friendly islanders, and which seems a consequence of their being accustomed to much action, is lost here, where the superior fertility of their country enables the inhabitants to lead a more indolent life; and its place is supplied by a plumpness and smoothness of the skin; which, though perhaps more consonant with our ideas of beauty, is no real advantage, as it seems attended with a kind of languor in all their motions, not observable in the others. This observation is fully verified in their boxing and wrestling, which may be called little better than the feeble efforts of children, if compared to the vigour with which these exercises are performed at the Friendly islands.\n\n\"Personal endowments being in great esteem amongst them, they have recourse to several methods of improving them, according to their notions of beauty. In particular, it is a practice, especially amongst the arrogy, or unmarried men of some consequence, to undergo a kind of physical operation, to render them fair. This is done by remaining a month or two in the house; during which time they wear a great quantity of clothes, eat nothing but bread-fruit, to which they ascribe a remarkable property in whitening them. They also speak, as if their corpulence and colour, at other times, depended upon their food; as they are obliged, from the change of seasons, to use different sorts at different times.\n\n\"The graceful air and firm step with which these people walk are not the least obvious proof of their personal accomplishments. They consider this as a thing so natural, or so necessary to be acquired, that nothing used to excite their laughter sooner, than to see us frequently stumbling upon the roots of trees, or other inequalities of the ground.\n\n\"Their countenances very remarkably express the abundant mildness or good nature which they possess, and are entirely free from that savage keenness which marks nations in a barbarous state. One would, indeed, be apt to fancy that they had been bred up under the fewest restrictions to acquire an aspect so settled, and such a command of their passions, as well as steadiness in conduct. But they are at the same time frank, cheerful, and good-humoured, though sometimes, in the presence of their chiefs, they put on a degree of gravity, and such a serious air, as becomes stiff and awkward, and has an appearance of reserve.\n\n\"Their peaceable disposition is sufficiently evinced from the friendly reception all strangers have met with who have visited them. Instead of offering to attack them openly or clandestinely, as has been the case with most of the inhabitants of these seas, they have never appeared in the smallest degree hostile, but on the contrary, like the most civilized people, have courted an intercourse with their visitors by bartering, which is the only medium that unites all nations in a sort of friendship. They understand barter (which they call fakka-ton) so perfectly, that at first we imagined they might have acquired the knowledge of it by commercial intercourse with the neighbouring islands; but we were afterwards assured, that they had little or no traffic except with Feejee, from which they get the red feathers, and some few other articles which they esteem. Perhaps no nation in the world traffic with more honesty, and less dishonesty. We could always safely permit them to examine our goods, and to hand them about one to another; and they put the same confidence in us. If either party repented of the bargain, the goods were re-exchanged with mutual consent and good humour. Upon the whole, they seem possessed of many of the most excellent qualities that adorn the human mind, such as industry, ingenuity, perseverance, affability, and perhaps other virtues which our short stay with them might prevent our observing.\n\n\"The only defect fullying their character that we know of is their propensity to thieving, to which we found those of all ages and both sexes addicted, and to an uncommon degree. It should, however, be considered, that this exceptionable part of their conduct seemed to exist merely with respect to us; for in their general intercourse with one another, I had reason to be of opinion, that thefts do not happen more frequently (perhaps less so) than in other countries, the dishonest practices of whose worthless individuals are not supposed to authorize any indiscriminate censure on the whole body of the people. Great allowances should be made for the foibles of these poor natives of the Pacific ocean, whose minds were overpowered with the glare of objects, equally new to them as they were captivating. Stealing, amongst the civilized and enlightened nations of the world, may well be considered as denoting a character deeply stained with moral turpitude, with avarice unrestrained by the known rules of right, and with profligacy producing extreme indigence, and neglecting the means of relieving it. But at the Friendly and other islands which we visited, the thefts so frequently committed by the natives, of what we had brought along with us, may be fairly traced to less culpable motives. They seemed to arise solely from an intense curiosity or desire to possess something which they had not been accustomed to before, and belonging to a sort of people so different from themselves. And, perhaps, if it were possible that a set of beings seemingly so superior in our judgement as we are in theirs should appear amongst us, it might be doubted, whether our natural regard to justice would be able to restrain many from falling into the same error. That I have assigned the true motive for their propensity to this practice, appears from their stealing everything indiscriminately at first sight,\nOtahite, right, before they could have the least conception of converting their prize to any one useful purpose. But I believe, with us, no person would forfeit his reputation, or expose himself to punishment, without knowing beforehand how to employ the stolen goods. Upon the whole, the pilfering disposition of these islanders, though certainly disagreeable and troublesome to strangers, was the means of affording us some information as to the quickness of their intellects. For their small thefts were committed with much dexterity; and those of greater consequence with a plan or scheme suited to the importance of the objects. An extraordinary instance of the last sort was, in their attempts to carry away one of the Discovery's anchors at mid-day.\n\nTheir common diet is made up of at least nine-tenths of vegetable food; and I believe more particularly the mahoe, or fermented bread-fruit, which makes part almost of every meal, has a remarkable effect upon them, preventing a coltive habit, and producing a very sensible coolness about them, which could not be perceived in us who fed on animal food. And it is, perhaps, owing to this temperate course of life that they have so few diseases among them. See No. 8.\n\n\"They only reckon five or six which might be called chronic or national disorders; amongst which are the dropsy, and the sefair, or indolent swellings before mentioned, as frequent at Tongataboo. But this was before the arrival of the Europeans; for we have added to this short catalogue a disease which abundantly supplies the place of all the others, and is now almost universal. For this they seem to have no effectual remedy. The priests, indeed, sometimes give them a medley of simples, but they own that it never cures them. And yet they allow that in a few cases nature, without the assistance of a physician, exterminates the poison of this fatal disease, and a perfect recovery is produced. They say, that if a man is infected with it he will often communicate it to others in the same house, by feeding out of the same utensils, or handling them; and that, in this case, they frequently die, while he recovers; though we see no reason why this should happen. See No. 9.\n\n\"Their behaviour on all occasions seems to indicate a great openness and generosity of disposition. Omai, indeed, who, as their countryman, should be supposed rather willing to conceal any of their defects, has often said that they are sometimes cruel in punishing their enemies. According to his representation, they torment them very deliberately; at one time tearing out small pieces of flesh from different parts; at another taking out the eyes; then cutting off the nose; and lastly, killing them by opening the belly. But this only happens on particular occasions. If cheerfulness argues a conscious innocence, one would suppose that their life is seldom filled by crimes. This, however, I rather impute to their feelings, which, though lively, seem in no case permanent; for I never saw them in any misfortune labour under the appearance of anxiety after the critical moment was past. Neither does care ever seem to wrinkle their brow. On the contrary, even the approach of death does not appear to alter their usual vacancy. I have seen them when brought to the brink of the grave by disease, and when preparing to go to battle; but in neither case ever observed their countenances overclouded with melancholy or serious reflection. Such a disposition leads them to direct all their aims only to what can give them pleasure and ease. Their amusements all tend to excite and continue their amorous passions; and their songs, of which they are immoderately fond, answer the same purpose. But as a constant succession of sensual enjoyments must cloy, we found that they frequently varied them to more refined subjects, and had much pleasure in chanting their triumphs in war, and their occupations in peace; their travels to other islands and adventures there; and the peculiar beauties, and superior advantages of their own island over the rest, or of different parts of it over other less favourite districts. This marks that they receive great delight from music; and though they rather expressed a dislike to our complicated compositions, yet were they always delighted with the more melodious sounds produced singly on our instruments, as approaching nearer to the simplicity of their own. Neither are they strangers to the soothing effects produced by particular sorts of motion, which in some cases seem to allay any perturbation of mind with as much success as music. Of this I met with a remarkable instance. For, on walking one day about Matavai Point, where our tents were erected, I saw a man paddling in a small canoe so quickly, and looking about with such eagerness on each side, as to command all my attention. At first I imagined that he had stolen something from one of the ships, and was pursued; but on waiting patiently saw him repeat his amusement. He went out from the shore till he was near the place where the swell begins to take its rise; and, watching its first motion very attentively, paddled before it with great quickness till he found that it overtook him, and had acquired sufficient force to carry his canoe before it, without passing underneath. He then sat motionless, and was carried along at the same rate as the wave, till it landed him upon the beach. Then he started out, emptied his canoe, and went in search of another swell. I could not help concluding, that this man felt the most supreme pleasure, while he was driven on so fast and so smoothly by the sea; especially as, though the tents and ships were so near, he did not seem in the least to envy, or even to take any notice of, the crowds of his countrymen collected to view them as objects which were rare and curious. During my stay, two or three of the natives came up, who seemed to share his felicity, and always called out when there was an appearance of a favourable swell, as he sometimes missed it, by his back being turned, and looking about for it. By them I understood that this exercise, which is called eharoae, was frequent amongst them; and they have probably more amusements of this sort, which afford them at least as much pleasure as skating, which is the only one of ours with whose effects I could compare it.\"\n\nThe language of these islanders is soft and melodious; Language it abounds with vowels, and the pronunciation of it is &c. easily acquired; but it was found excessively difficult to teach the natives to pronounce a single English word; probably not only from its abounding with consonants, but from some peculiarity in its structure; for Spanish and Italian words, if ending in a vowel, they pronounced with the greatest ease. A sufficient acquaintance has not been formed with it to determine whether it is copious or not; but it is certainly very imperfect, being totally without inflexion either of nouns or verbs. Few of the nouns have more than one case, and few of the verbs\nverbs more than one tenfe. It was impossible to teach the islanders to pronounce the names of their guests. They called Captain Cook Toote; Mr. Hicks, the first lieutenant, Hete, &c., and in this manner they formed names for almost every man in the ship. In some, however, it was not easy to find any traces of the original; and they were perhaps not mere arbitrary founds formed upon the occasion, but signified words in their own language; and it seems that they could perfectly remember these appellations at the distance of four years, by their inquiries after such gentlemen as were absent on the second voyage by name. Mr. Monkhouse, a midshipman, they called Matie, which in their language signifies dead; because he commanded a party that killed a man for stealing a mullet. The nearest imitation they could reach of King George, was by calling him Kihiargo. We have the following observations on this subject, in vol. ii. of Cook's last voyage to the Pacific ocean: \"The language of Otaheite, though doubtless radically the same with that of New Zealand and the Friendly islands, is destitute of that guttural pronunciation, and of some consonants, with which those latter dialects abound. The specimens we have already given are sufficient to mark wherein the variation chiefly consists, and to show, that, like the manners of the inhabitants, it has become soft and soothing. During the former voyage, I had collected a copious vocabulary, which enabled me the better to compare this dialect with that of the other islands; and during this voyage I took every opportunity of improving my acquaintance with it, by conversing with Omai before we arrived, and by my daily intercourse with the natives while we now remained there (A). It abounds with beautiful and figurative expressions, which, were it perfectly known, would I have no doubt, put it upon a level with many of the languages that are most in esteem for their warm and bold images. For instance, the Otaheiteans express their notions of death very emphatically, by saying, \"that the soul goes into darkness; or rather into night.\" And, if you seem to entertain any doubt, in asking the question, \"if such a person is their mother,\" they immediately reply with surpise, \"Yes, the mother that bore me.\" They have one expression that corresponds exactly with the phraseology of the scriptures, where we read of the \"yearning of the bowels.\"—They use it on all occasions, when the passions give them uneasiness, as they constantly refer pain from grief, anxious desire, and other affections, to the bowels, as its seat; where they likewise suppose all operations of the mind are performed. Their language admits of that inverted arrangement of words which so much distinguishes the Latin and Greek from most of our modern European tongues, whose imperfections require a more orderly construction, to prevent ambiguities. It is so copious, that for the bread-fruit alone, in its different states, they have above 20 names; as many for the taro root; and about 10 for the cocoanut. Add to this, that, besides the common dialect, they often expatiate in a kind of stanza or recitative, which is answered in the same manner.\"\n\nA map of Otaheite, engraved for Captain Cook's first voyage, was taken out, and laid before Tuahoe the high admiral, without informing him of what it was; however, he immediately found it out, and was overjoyed to see a representation of his own country. He pointed out all the districts of it, naming every one of them in their order.\n\nThese people have a remarkable sagacity in foretelling the weather, particularly the quarter from whence the wind will blow. In their long voyages they steer by the sun in the day, and in the night by the stars; all of which they distinguish by separate names, and know in what part of the heaven they will appear in any of the months during which they are visible in their horizon. They also know the times of their annual appearing and disappearing, with more precision than would easily be believed by an European astronomer. Their time they seem to reckon by moons, 13 of which make a year. The day they divide into six parts, and the night into an equal number. They judge of the time of the day by the height of the sun, but they cannot ascertain the time of the night by the stars. In numeration, the greatest length they can go is 200; that is, when they have counted each of their fingers and toes ten times over. When they take the distance from one place to another, they express it by the time which is required to pass it.\n\nThe government of the Otaheiteans seems greatly to resemble the early state of the European nations under the feudal system. Their orders of dignity are caree-rahee, which answers to king; caree, baron; manohouin, vassal; and teutouw, villain. There are two kings in the island, one being the sovereign of each of the peninsulas of which it consists. Each of them is treated with great respect by all ranks, but does not appear to be invested with so much power as is exercised by the carees in their own districts. When the king, whom they called O-Too, made a visit to Captain Cook, the chiefs, who happened to be there before him, immediately stripped themselves in great haste. Captain Cook took notice of it; upon which they said caree, caree, signifying, that it was on account of O-Too being present; but this was the only outward token of respect they paid him, for they never rose from their seats, or made any other obeisance.\n\nThe carees are lords of one or more of the districts into which each of the peninsulas is divided, and of which there are 43 in the larger one. These parcel out their territories to the manohouins, who superintend the cultivation of the ground. The lowest class, called teutouw, seem to be nearly under the same circumstances with the villeins in feudal governments. They do all the laborious work, cultivate the land, catch fish, fetch wood and water, &c. Each of the carees keeps a kind of court, and has a great number of attendants, chiefly the younger brothers of their own tribe, and among these some hold particular offices, but of which little more is known than some of their names.\n\nIn this country a child succeeds to his father's titles and authority as soon as he is born; and thus the king no sooner has a son born, than his sovereignty ceases.\n\n(A) See this vocabulary at the end of the second volume of Captain Cook's second voyage. Many corrections and additions to it were now made by this indefatigable inquirer; but the specimens of the language of Otaheite, already in the hands of the public, seem sufficient for every useful purpose.\nA regent is then chosen; and the father generally retains his power under that title, until his child becomes of age. The child of the baron succeeds to the titles and honours of its father, as soon as it is born, as well as the son of the king; so that a baron who was yesterday called caree, and was approached with the ceremony of lowering their garments, to as to uncover the upper part of the body, is to-day, if his wife happens to be delivered of a child, reduced to the rank of a private man; all marks of respect being transferred to the child, if it is suffered to live, though the father still continues, possessor and administrator of his estate. But the acquiescence which the lower classes of people, or towowos, yield to the command of their chiefs, is very remarkable. They are not suffered to taste any animal food, although they are employed in feeding it for their lords. They endure patiently very severe blows, if, when collected into a large body, they in any manner press upon or annoy the king or a chief in his progress; and all this native spirit is preserved without any power being lodged in the hands of the king to exact it; for he uses no military force, nor is even attended with body guards.\n\nThere are but few actions which are reckoned crimes among the Otaheiteans. Adultery, however, is sometimes punished with death; but in general, the woman escapes with a severe beating, and the gallant passes unnoticed. The regulation of public justice is not confined to the magistracy; for the injured party redresses his own wrong by inflicting whatever punishment he can upon the offender: but in matters of notorious wrong the chiefs sometimes interpose. The nobility have livery for their servants; and in proportion as the master's rank is more or less elevated, these livery are worn higher or lower, being fastened close under the arms of the servants belonging to the chiefs, and going round the loins of those belonging to the lowest class of nobility. Several parts of the island seem to be private property, which descend to the heir of the possessor on his death, and the descent seems to fall indifferently on man or woman. Captain Cook was of opinion that the number of inhabitants on the whole island amounted to 254,000 including women and children.\n\nThe religious language of the Otaheiteans, like that of the Gentoo Brahmans, is different from what is used in common discourse; but, according to the accounts we have of their notions concerning the origin of the world, nothing can be more ridiculous. They imagine that the Supreme Deity, besides a great many female deities, has one son named Tane, and to him they direct their worship, though they do not believe that the good or bad conduct of mankind here on earth makes them more or less acceptable to this divinity. They believe the existence of the soul after death, and of a greater or lesser degree of happiness to be then enjoyed: but they seem to have no conception of a state of punishment or of suffering hereafter. The share of happiness which they imagine every individual will enjoy in this future state, will be assigned to him according to the rank he holds on earth. We are not, however, told wherein they suppose the happiness of this future state to consist; but it is most probably a pretty exact imitation of a Mohammedan paradise, for these voluptuaries can hardly be supposed capable of imagining any pleasure independent of the intercourse of the sexes.\n\nThe priesthood seems to be hereditary in one family or tribe; and as it is said to be numerous, probably those of that order are restrained from becoming members of the army: but whether or not my peculiar decrees is necessary to be observed, hath not yet appeared. These priests are professedly the men of science; but their knowledge is altogether frivolous and useless; for it consists in being conversant with the names of their different divinities, and such absurd traditions as have been handed down among them from one generation to another. Their religious notions being deposited in an unknown tongue, they are respected because they are not understood; and as the cure of the soul is no object of regard, the most important concern to these people, the cure of their bodies, is committed to the priests, and much parade is used in their attempts to recover the sick, though their remedies consist of ridiculous ceremonies and enchantments rather than any thing else.\n\nThe marriages of these people are merely secular contracts; but no one has a right to perform the operation of tattooing except the priests; and this being a custom universally adopted by the natives, it may be supposed that performing it is a very lucrative employment. The males in general undergo a kind of circumcision, which it is disgraceful not to comply with, and which is likewise the exclusive privilege of the priests to perform. But what most establishes the credit of this order of men is their skill in astronomy and navigation.\n\nCaptain Cook, who had some reason to believe that among the religious customs of this people, human sacrifices were sometimes offered up to their deities, went to a moral, or place of worship, accompanied by Captain Furneaux, having with them a sailor who spoke the language tolerably well, and several of the natives. In the moral was a tapawo, a kind of bier, with a shed erected over it, on which lay a corpse and some provisions. Captain Cook then asked if the plantain were for the Eatau? If they sacrificed to the Eatau hogs, dogs, fowls, &c.? To all of which an intelligent native answered in the affirmative. He then asked if they sacrificed men to the Eatau? He was answered, taato eno, \"bad men they did; first taparthy, beating them till they were dead.\" He then asked if good men were put to death in this manner? His answer was no, only taato eno. The Captain then asked if any cares were? The native replied, they had hogs to give the Eatau, and again repeated taato eno. He was then asked if towows, who had no hogs, dogs, or fowls, but yet were good men, were ever sacrificed to the Eatau? The answer still was no, only bad men. Many other questions were put to him; all his answers to which seemed to confirm the ideas that men for certain crimes were condemned to be sacrificed to the gods, provided they did not possess any property which they might give for their redemption. However, in pursuing such inquiries as these, no certain information could be obtained, on account of the flighty knowledge which had been acquired of the language of the country; but according to further accounts which Captain Cook received from Omai, it seems to rest with the high-priest to single out the victims for sacrifice; who, when the people are assembled on any solemn occasion, retires alone into the house of God, and stays there for some time; when he comes out, he informs the assembly that he has seen and converted with the great god (the high priest alone having that privilege), and that he has asked for a human sacrifice; and tells them he has desired such a person.\nperson, naming a man present, who has most probably, on some account or other, rendered himself obnoxious to this ghostly father. The words are no sooner gone out of his mouth, than the devoted wretch is put to death; for his guilt cannot be doubted, after the oracle has pronounced his doom.\n\nOn this island was seen the figure of a man constructed of basket work, rudely made, but not ill designed: it was something more than seven feet high, and rather too bulky in proportion to its height. This wicker skeleton was completely covered with feathers, which were white where the skin was to appear, and black in the parts which it is their custom to paint or stain, as well as upon the head, which was designed to represent hair. Upon the head also were four protuberances, three in front, and one behind, which the Indians called tate etc., little men. The image was called Monoe; it was a representation of Maroe, one of their Eataus, or gods of the second class, and was said to be the only one of the kind on Otaheite.\n\nThese people pray at sunrise and sunset. They have also a number of superstitious practices, in order to conciliate the influence of evil genii. E-tee, a chief, who seemed to be the king's prime minister in 1774, very seriously asked Mr Forster whether they had a god (Eataua) in their country, and whether they prayed to him (before?). When he told them that they acknowledged a divinity who had made everything, and was invisible, and that they were accustomed to address their petitions to him, he seemed to be highly pleased, and repeated his words with comments of his own, to several persons who sat round him; seeming thereby to intimate, that the ideas of his countrymen corresponded with theirs in this respect.\n\nTheir morals are used both as burying-grounds and places of worship; they are approached with the most wonderful expressions of reverence and humility; and this, it should seem, not because anything there is esteemed sacred, but because they there worship an invisible being, for whom they entertain the most reverential respect, although not excited by the hope of reward or the dread of punishment. Though they do not appear to have any visible object of worship, yet says Captain Cook, this island, and indeed the rest that lie near it, have a particular bird, some a heron, and others a king's-fisher, to which they pay a particular regard, and concerning which they have some superstitious notions, respecting good or bad fortune, as we have of the swallow and robin redbreast, and will on no account molest or kill them. One of these cemeteries, or places of worship, was known to Captain Cook, on his first voyage, by the name of Tootahah's moral, then the regent; but when, on his second voyage, after the death of that chief, he called it by that name, Maratata, a chief that accompanied the party, interrupted him, intimating, that it was no longer Tootahah's after his death, but was then known as O-Too's moral, the then reigning prince. A fine moral for princes! daily reminding them of mortality whilst they live, and teaching them, that after death they cannot call even that ground their own which their dead corpse occupies! The chief and his wife, on passing by it, took their upper garments from their shoulders. From hence it would seem, that the royal family have a particular moral, and that it always bears the name of the reigning prince.\n\nAn Indian, who had snatched away a musket from a fenceman whilst on duty, was, by the inhumanity of a midshipman who commanded the guard, pursued and shot. The unhappy fate of this poor fellow gave an opportunity for seeing the manner in which these people treat their dead. They placed the corpse in the open air till the bones became quite dry; a shed was erected close by the house where the deceased had resided; it was about 15 feet long, and 11 broad; one end was left quite open; the other end, and the two sides, were partly inclosed with a sort of wicker-work. The bier was a frame of wood, like that on which the tea-beds, called coas, are placed, with a matted bottom, and supported by four poles, at the height of about four feet from the ground. The body was covered first with a mat, and then with white cloth; by the side of it lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war; and near the head of it, which lay next to the close end of the shed, lay two cocoa-nut shells; at the other end a bunch of green leaves, with some dried twigs, all tied together, were stuck in the ground, by which lay a stone about as big as a cocoa-nut. Near these lay one of the young plantain-leaves that are used for emblems of peace, and close by it a stone axe. At the open end of the shed also hung, in several strings, a great number of palm nuts; and without the shed was stuck up in the ground a stem of a plantain tree, about five feet high, upon the top of which was placed a cocoanut shell full of fresh water; against the side of one of the poles hung a small bag, containing a few pieces of bread-fruit ready roasted, which had not been put in all at one time, some being fresh and others stale. This minute examination of their manner of treating their dead, seemed to be very unwelcome to the natives. The food so placed by the corpse is designed as an offering to their gods. They cast in, near the body, small pieces of cloth, on which the tears and blood of the mourners have been shed; for in their prayers of grief it is an universal custom, to wound themselves with a shark's tooth. The mourner is always a man; and he is dressed in a very singular habit. When the bones are stripped of their flesh, and become dry, they are buried. This regard to their dead is very remarkable: one of the ship's company happening to pull a flower from a tree which grew on one of their sepulchral inclosures, an Indian came suddenly behind him and struck him; and a party of sailors, who were sent to get some stones for ballast for the ship, had like to have been embroiled by the natives, by pulling down some part of an inclosure of this kind. This shade under which their dead are laid is called tapapou; the inclosure in which their bones are deposited is called moral; these latter, as has been already related, are also places of worship. As soon as a native of Otaheite is known to be dead, the house is filled with relations, who deplore their loss; some by loud lamentations, and some by loud clamorous, but more genuine expressions of grief. Those who are in the nearest degree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are silent; the rest are one moment uttering passionate exclamations in a chorus, and the next laughing and talking without the least appearance of concern. In this manner the remainder of the day on which they assemble is spent, and all the succeeding night.\nnext morning, the body is shrouded in their cloth, and conveyed to the sea-side on a bier, which the bearers support upon their shoulders, attended by the priest, who having prayed over the body repeats his sentences during the procession. When it arrives at the water's edge, it is set down upon the beach; the priest renewing his prayers, and taking up some of the water in his hands, sprinkles it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back 40 or 50 yards; and soon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and sprinkling are repeated. It is thus removed backwards and forwards several times; and while these ceremonies have been performing, a house has been built, and a small space of ground raised in. In the centre of this house, or tapapow, as they term it, poles are set up to support the bier, which is at length conveyed thither, and placed upon it; and here the body remains to putrefy, till the flesh is wholly wasted from the bones. These houses of corruption are of a size proportioned to the rank of the person whose body they are to contain. Those allotted to the lower classes are just sufficient to cover the bier, and have no railing round them. The largest that was seen was 11 yards long; and such are ornamented according to the abilities and inclination of the surviving kindred, who never fail to lay a profusion of good cloth about the body, and sometimes almost cover the outside of the house. Garlands of the fruit of the palm nut, or pandanus, and cocoa-leaves, twisted by the priests in mysterious knots, with a plant called by them ethie no moral, which is particularly consecrated to funeral solemnities, are deposited about the place; provision and water are also left at a little distance. As soon as the body is deposited in the tapapow, the mourning is renewed. The women assemble, and are led to the door by the nearest relation, who strikes a shark's tooth several times into the crown of her head; the blood copiously flows, and is carefully received upon pieces of linen, which are thrown under the bier. The rest of the women follow this example; and the ceremony is repeated at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and sorrow of the parties hold out. The tears also which are shed upon these occasions are received upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead. Some of the younger people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other offerings. This custom is founded on a notion, that the soul of the deceased, which they believe to exist in a separate state, is hovering about the place where the body is deposited; that it observes the actions of the survivors, and is gratified by such testimonies of their affectionate grief. Whilst these ceremonies are carrying on by the women, the men seem to be wholly insensible of their loss; but two or three days after, they also begin to perform a part. The nearest relations take it in turn to assume the dress, and perform the offices.\n\nThe chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat stick, the edge of which is set with shark's teeth; and in a frenzy, which his grief is supposed to have inspired, he runs at all he sees, and if any of them happen to be overtaken, he strikes them most unmercifully with his indented cudgel, which cannot fail to wound them in a dangerous manner. The processions continue at certain intervals for five moons; but are less and less frequent, by a gradual diminution, as the end of that time approaches. When it is expired, what remains of the body is taken down from the bier; and the bones, having been scraped and washed very clean, are buried, according to the rank of the person, either within or without a morai. If the deceased was an earl, or chief, his skull is not buried with the rest of his bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in a kind of box made for that purpose, which is also placed in the morai. This coffin is called evaharre no te oremeiau, \"the house of a teacher, or master.\" After this the mourning ceases, except some of the women continue to be really afflicted at the loss, and in that case they will suddenly wound themselves with the shark's tooth wherever they happen to be. The ceremonies, however, do not cease with the mourning; for prayers are still said by the priest, and offerings made at the morai. Some of the things, which from time to time are deposited there, are emblematical; a young plantain is said to represent the deceased, and a bunch of feathers the Deity who is invoked. The priest places himself over against the symbol of the god, accompanied by some of the relations, who are furnished with a small offering: he repeats his orison in a set form, consisting of separate sentences; at the same time weaving the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different forms, which he afterwards deposits upon the ground where the bones have been interred; the Deity is then addressed by a shrill screech, which is used only upon that occasion. When the priest retires, the tuft of feathers is removed, and the provisions are left to putrefy, or be devoured by the rats.\n\nThis ceremony of mourning, as described above, was performed by Tirope, one of the wives of Tubouari Tamaide; who, when the bleeding from the wounds which she had thus given herself ceased, looked up with a smile on the company round her, and who had before inquired of her, very earnestly, the cause of her behaviour, without receiving any answer, or having been at all noticed by her. She then began to pick up some small pieces of cloth which she had spread to catch the blood; and having got them all together, she went to the shore, and threw them into the sea. She then plunged into the river; and having washed her whole body, returned to the company as cheerful as ever. To add to the singularity of this conduct, the Indians who stood round her all the time that this frantic distress was performing, conversed with great indifference and jocularity.\n\nThere is not a more ancient custom handed down to us than that of cutting the body to express grief and distress of mind. In the code of laws delivered by Moses to the Israelites, 1400 years before the Christian era, this practice is expressly forbidden to that people: \"Ye shall not cut yourselves, or make any baldness between the eyes for the dead,\" Deut. xiv. 1. Hence it may be supposed that this rite prevailed in Egypt, from whence the Jews derived most of those propensities which were inhibited by their great legislator. We are told likewise in the book of Kings, of the priests of Baal wounding themselves, after they had long waited in vain for the supernatural intervention of their idol. D'Arvieux informs us, that the modern Arabs retain the same custom, and that the part they chiefly wound is their arms. The difference in the practice as now prevailing in Otaheite and Arabia seems to be, that in the first none but the women make use of it, and in the latter it is confined to the men, and generally used to express their desperate palliation for some favourite misfortunes.\nThe mourning which is worn here is a head dress of feathers, the colour of which is consecrated to death, and a veil over the face. This dress is called eoa. The whole nation is said to appear thus on the death of their king. The mourning for fathers is very long. The women mourn for their husbands, but not the husbands for their wives.\n\nWe shall conclude this account of Otaheite with the history of Oma, or, as he is improperly called Omiah, who was brought over to England. He was a native of Ulietca, or Raiatea; and embarked at Huahine with Captain Furneaux, on board the Adventure, in September 1773; and the two ships separating in a storm on the coast of New Zealand a few months afterwards, the voyage of the Adventure was brought to a much earlier conclusion than that of the Resolution, for she arrived at Spithead the 14th of July following. This youth is said to have had some property in his native soil, of which he was dispossessed by the people of Bolabola; but he was not one of the earless, or gentry of that country, but of the middling class of people. He was eminent neither for figure, shape, nor complexion; his colour being of a deep hue, resembling a towlow, or one of the common people; and both Captain Cook and Mr Forster agree in thinking him no proper sample of the inhabitants of those islands, in respect of personal beauty. However, they are both of opinion, that the qualities of his heart and head resembled those of his countrymen in general, and that no one of the natives would have given more general satisfaction by his behaviour whilst he remained in England. He is described as possessing a good understanding, quick parts, and honest principles; not an extraordinary genius like Tupia; yet not at all deficient in intelligence, which appears from his knowledge of the game of chess, in which he made an amazing proficiency. His principal patrons, whilst in England, were, the earl of Sandwich, Mr Banks, and Doctor Solander. His noble patron introduced him to his majesty at Kew; and, during his stay in England, he was cared for by many of the principal nobility. He naturally imitated that easy and elegant politeness which is prevalent among the great, and which is one of the ornaments of civilized society. Indeed he adopted the manners, the occupations, and amusements of his companions in general, and gave many proofs of a quick perception and a lively fancy. He appears, however, to have been treated, whilst he resided here, rather as a fashionable exhibition, than as a rational being. No attention seems to have been paid to the enriching his mind with useful knowledge, such as might have rendered him a valuable acquisition to his country on his return thither; no means were used to instruct him in agriculture, or any mechanical art or useful manufacture; and, above all, to polish him with a moral sense; to teach him the exalted ideas of virtue, and the sublime principles of revealed religion. After a stay of two years in England, and having been inoculated for the smallpox, he embarked with Captain Cook, on board the Resolution, on his return home, loaded with a profusion of presents. At parting with his friends here, his tears flowed plentifully, and his whole behaviour bespoke him to be sincerely affected at the separation: but though he lived in the midst of amusements during his residence in England, his return to his native country was always in his thoughts; and though he was not impatient to go, he expressed a satisfaction as the time of his return approached.\n\nSuch is the account of this people which our limits permit us to give. In the history of mankind it is not without importance; and in the hands of the philosopher, the moralist, or the divine, it may be useful. The subject, because but new, has been much agitated, and is pretty generally known. Such of our readers as make men and manners their peculiar study, will be anxious for further information; we must refer them, however, to those authors who have written particularly and copiously on the subject. Cook and other voyagers of eminence will at least command attention. We may just remark, that there must surely be something extremely fascinating in the persons, manners, or customs of the inhabitants, or in the soil and appearance of the country, that could tempt the greater part of a ship's crew to refuse authority, and forcibly to return to Otaheite; yet such we know was the case; and the sufferings of the commander, and those who refused to join in this vile conspiracy, and who were therefore exposed in an open boat, were indeed shocking. An account of it has been published.\n\nOTALGIA, the Ear-ach. See Medicine Index.\n\nO'ELLANDS, or Oatlands, in England, in the county of Surrey, near Weybridge, was formerly a royal palace, wherein Henry duke of Gloucester, third son to King Charles I. was born; and had a deer park, which in the civil wars was by the parliament laid open, and the house demolished. In 1673 there was a brick wall remaining, which encompassed ten acres; but there were then small traces of the chief pile, besides the gardener's lodge, wherein was the silk-worm room raised by King James I.'s queen. It is now a most magnificent building, and commands a most extensive and beautiful prospect. In the park there was a paddock, where Queen Elizabeth used to float with a crois bow. It is now the property of his royal highness the duke of York, who purchased it for £43,000, of the duke of Newcastle, 1789.\n\nORTFORD, in England, in the county of Kent, by the Darent, at the bottom of a hill. In 793 there was a battle at this place, between the two Saxon kings, Offa of Mercia and Aethelred of Kent, who was killed by Offa; and another in 1016, wherein the Danish king Canute was routed by King Edmund Ironside. The said Offa, to atone for the blood he had shed in that battle, first gave this place to Christ-church, Canterbury (as the deed says) in paesua porcorum, \"for the support of the archbishop's hogs;\" and so it remained in the archbishop's liberty, till exchanged with King Henry VIII. for other lands. There was a chantry founded at the Ryehoufe in this parish. The church was once a chapel to Shoreham.\n\nOTHNIEL, in sacred history, the son of Kenaz, of the tribe of Judah. We are told (Josh. xv. 17.), that Othniel was brother to Caleb; and (Judges i. 13.) it is expressly said, that he was Caleb's younger brother. There are, however, some difficulties in this; for if Caleb and Othniel had been brothers, the latter could not have married his niece Achsah the daughter of Caleb. Secondly, the scripture never affirms to Caleb and Othniel the same father; it always names Kenaz as father to Othniel, and Jephunneh as the father of Caleb. Lastly, Caleb must be much older than Othniel, since he\nOthniel, he gave Othniel his daughter Achsah in marriage. Thus it seems much better to suppose Kenaz and Jephunneh to be two brothers, and that Othniel and Caleb were cousins, and in this sense to be nearly related, or brothers according to the language of scripture. Thus Achsah being but second cousin in respect of Othniel, he might marry her without doing anything contrary to the letter of the law.\n\nCaleb having received his portion in the mountains of Judah, in the midst of a country that was possessed by giants of the race of Anak, after he had taken the city of Hebron, he advances towards Debir, otherwise called Kirjath-sepher, and declares that he would give his daughter Achsah in marriage to him that should take Kirjath-sepher. Othniel took it, and had Achsah to wife.\n\nAfter the death of Joshua, the Israelites not giving themselves the trouble to exterminate the Canaanites that were then in the land, and not having continued in their fidelity to the Lord, he delivered them over to Chushan-ruthaim king of Melopotamia (Judges iii. 4, &c.), to whom they continued in subjection for eight years. Then they cried to the Lord, who raised them up a deliverer in the person of Othniel the son of Kenaz, who was filled with the spirit of God, and judged Israel. He came into the field, and gave battle to Chushan-ruthaim, beat him, and delivered Israel in the year of the world 2599; and the country was at rest for forty years. After this Othniel died; but the precise year of his death is not known.\n\n**OTHO, M. SALVIUS,** a Roman emperor, born A.D. 32, of a family descended from the ancient kings of Etruria. He was among the number of Nero's favourites, and accordingly was raised to the highest offices of the state, and made governor of Pannonia by the interest of Seneca, who wished to remove him from Rome, lest Nero's love for Poppea should prove his ruin. After Nero's death Otho conciliated the favour of Galba the new emperor; but when he did not gain his point, and when Galba refused to adopt him as his successor, he resolved to make himself absolute, without any regard to the age or dignity of his friend. The great debts which he had contracted encouraged his avarice; and he procured the afflatus of Galba, and made himself emperor. He was acknowledged by the senate and the Roman people; but the sudden revolt of Vitellius in Germany rendered his situation very precarious, and it was mutually resolved that their respective right to the empire should be decided by arms. Otho obtained three victories, but in a general engagement near Brixellum his forces were defeated, and he stabbed himself when all hopes of success had vanished. This happened about the 37th year of his age, after a reign of about three months. It has been justly observed, that the last moments of Otho's life were those of a philosopher. He comforted his soldiers who lamented his fortune, and he expressed his concern for their safety when they earnestly solicited to pay him the last friendly offices before he stabbed himself; and he observed, that it was better that one man should die than that all should be involved in ruin on account of his obstinacy. His nephew was much affected and feared exceedingly the anger and haughtiness of the conqueror; but Otho comforted him, and observed, that Vitellius would be kind and affectionate to the friends and relations of Otho, since Otho was not ashamed to say, that in the time of their greatest enmity the mother of Vitellius had received every friendly treatment from his hands. He also burnt the letters which, by falling into the hands of Vitellius, might provoke his resentment against those who had favoured the cause of an unfortunate general. These noble and humane sentiments in a man who was the associate of Nero's shameful pleasures, and who had stained his hand in the blood of his master, have appeared to some wonderful, and have passed for the features of policy, and not of a naturally virtuous and benevolent heart. His father was a favourite of Claudius.\n\n**ORIO, a tribune of the people, who, in Cicero's consulship, made a regulation to permit the Roman knights at public spectacles to have the first rows after the feats of the senators. This was opposed with virulence by some, but Cicero ably defended it, &c.**\n\n**OTHO, VENIUS,** a very celebrated Dutch painter. He was descended of a considerable family in Leyden, and was born in 1556. He was carefully educated by his parents in the belles lettres, and at the same time learned to design of Isaac Nicholas. He was but 15 when the civil wars obliged him to leave his country. He retired to Liege, finished his studies, and there gave the first proofs of the excellence of his mind. He was well known to Cardinal Groofeck, who gave him letters of recommendation when he went to Rome, where he was entertained by Cardinal Madreco. His genius was so active, that he applied himself to philosophy, poetry, mathematics, and painting, all at once. He became a great proficient in designing under Frederico Zuchero. He acquired an excellence in all the parts of painting, especially in the knowledge of the claro-obscuro; by which means he came to be accounted one of the most ingenious men of his age. He lived at Rome seven years, during which time he performed several rare pieces; and then passing into Germany, was received into the service of the emperor. After this the duke of Bavaria and the elector of Cologne employed him; but all the advantages he got from the courts of foreign princes could not detain him there. He had a desire to return into the Low Countries, of which Alexander Farnese, prince of Parma, was then governor. He drew the prince's picture, armed cap-a-pie, which confirmed his reputation in the Netherlands. After the death of that prince, Venus returned to Antwerp, where he adorned the principal churches with his paintings. The archduke Albert, who succeeded the prince of Parma in the government of the Low Countries, sent for him to Brussel, and made him master of the mint; a place which occupied much of his time, yet he found some time for the exercise of his profession. He drew the archduke and the infanta Isabella's portraits at large, which were sent to James I. of Great Britain; and, to show his knowledge of polite learning likewise, he published several treatises, which he embellished with cuts of his own designing. Louis III. made him very great offers to tempt him into his service; but he would never leave his own country, satisfying himself with the character and employments he held there. He was the first, after Polydore Caravaggio, who reduced the claro-obscuro to a principle of the art of painting. Rubens perfected what he began, and the whole Flemish school\nOtho learned it of him. Venus died at Brussels, 1634, in his 78th year. He had two brothers, Gilbert, who was a graver, and Peter a painter. He had also the honour of breeding up the famous Rubens in his art.\n\n**OTTONNA**, a genus of plants belonging to the syngenesia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae. See Botany Index.\n\n**OTHRYADES**, one of the 300 Spartans who fought against 300 Argives, when those two nations disputed their respective right to Thyreata. Two Argives, Alcinos and Cronius, and Othryades, survived the battle. The Argives went home to carry the news of their victory; but Othryades, who had been reckoned among the number of the slain on account of his wounds, recovered himself, and carried some of the spoils of which he had stripped the Argives into the camp of his countrymen; and after he had raised a trophy, and had written with his own blood the word *vict* on his shield, he killed himself, unable or unwilling to survive the death of his countrymen.\n\n**OTIS**, a genus of birds belonging to the order of galline. See Ornithology Index.\n\n**OTLEY**, a town of England, in the west riding of Yorkshire, under a cliff called Chevin, on the south side of the river Wharfe. The adjacent parts are reckoned the most delightful in England. Its church has lately been elegantly fitted up, in which are several good old monuments. The adjacent country is much improved, and from the Chevin is a most beautiful view of an extensive scope of undescribed magnificence. This manor was given by Athelstan to the see of York, whose archbishop had a palace here, with several extensive privileges. There is a free grammar school in this place, founded by Mr Cave, 1611, called Prince Henry's School. In 1673, it suffered much by an inundation; which carried away several bridges, mills, &c., as well as much corn, &c. W. Long. i. 48. N. Lat. 53° 54'.\n\n**OTODINI**, ancient Britons, seated, as some suppose, to the north east of the Brigantes, in the countries now called Northumberland, Merse, and the Lothians. As the Otodini are not mentioned by any of the Roman historians, but only by Ptolemy, it is uncertain whether they formed a distinct independent state, or were united with the Brigantes. They were, however, a considerable people, and possessed a long tract of the sea-coast, from the river Tine to the frith of Forth. Their name is derived by Baxter from the old British words *Ot o dîneu*, which signify \"a high and rocky shore;\" descriptive enough of their country. They were probably reduced by Agricola at the same time with their more powerful neighbours the Brigantes; but as they lived without the wall of Severus, they were, like the rest of the Maeatae, engaged in frequent revolts. In the most perfect state of the Roman government in this island, the country of the Otodini made a part of the Roman province called Valentia; which comprehended all that large tract between the two walls. As this province was never long together in the peaceable possession of the Romans, they had but few stations in the country of the Otodini, except those on the line of the wall of Severus.\n\nVarious authors have derived the name of this people in various ways, and it is very differently spelled; and various opinions still seem to be entertained among the learned respecting their real situation; and it is even doubtful whether their country was in England or in Scotland. The celebrated Drummond of Hawthornden contends for the latter.\n\n**OTRANTO**, or Terra d'Otranto, a province of Italy in the kingdom of Naples; bounded on the north by the Terra di Bari and by the gulf of Venice, on the east by the same gulf, and on the south, and west by a great bay which is between that and the Basilicata. It is a mountainous country, abounding in figs, olives, and wine. It is often visited by locusts, and by Algerine pirates, who carry off all the people they can catch into slavery. But to keep them off, there are a great many forts on the coasts.\n\nOtranto, a city of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and capital of the province of the same name, with a commodious harbour, an archbishop's see, and a strong citadel, where the archbishop resides. Mr Swinburne gives this account of it: \"It is (says he) small, stands on a hill, and contains only 3000 inhabitants. Its little harbour is not so bad; but it might induce more people to settle here, as no port on the coast lies so convenient for traffic with Greece. The Adriatic gulf is here but 60 miles wide. I climbed to the top of a tower, to get a sight of the Acroceramian mountains; but a vapour hanging over the sea, along the horizon, hid them from my view: in a clear morning, their snowy tops are said to be very visible. The cathedral of Otranto is Gothic, and, according to the Puglian fashion, has its subterraneous sanctuary. The columns are of beautiful marble and granite; the pavement, a rude species of mosaic, commonly called Saracenic: As it is to be met with in all churches founded by the Norman kings of Sicily, the artists who laid it were probably Saracens, or at least Greeks, their scholars. These mosaics are composed of pieces of porphyry, serpentine, and cubes of gilt glass,—disposed in stars, circles, or chequers. The compartments of the stalls are bordered with them; and the small twisted columns, which support the pulpits and canopies, are ornamented with a spiral stripe of the same work. It is a pity to much durability, compactness, and beauty of materials, should have been lavished on such barbarous designs. Otranto was a Roman colony, as is certified by an inscription, almost the only monument of antiquity left there (a). In the 10th century it was made an archbishop's see. In 1480, Laurence de Medici, to deliver himself from the attacks of the king of Naples, persuaded Mahomet II. to invade the realm; and Otranto was the unfortunate place where the Turks landed. It was invested, stormed, and pillaged. Its prelate was slain at the door of his church; 800 principal citizens dragged out of the gates and butchered; their bodies left 12 months unburied, till the duke of Calabria retook the city, and committed them to hallowed earth. About 100 years after, a devout person affirmed, that these bones had appeared to him in a dream;\n\n---\n\n(a) \"Num. Hyd.—ÆR Caput barb. & laureat. ΥΑΡΟΝΤΙΝΩΝ. = Tridens, cum duobus delphinibus.\"\ndream; and, upon the strength of his vision, they became, for the vulgar, objects of almost equal veneration with the relics of the primitive martyrs.\"\n\nOTRICOLI, a small town of Italy, in the ecclesiastical state, and in the duchy of Spoleto, in E. Long. 12° 27', N. Lat. 42° 26'. situated on a rising ground on the frontiers of the patrimony of St Peter. From this town is seen a fine plain, and some of the windings of the famous river Tiber. The ruins that are scattered here and there at the entrance of the plain, descending from Otricoli, are thought to be the remains of the ancient Otriculum; they consist of some fragments of columns, cornices, and other pieces of marble. In the middle of the great street of Otricoli, there is a marble pedestal, upon which you see an inscription, showing they had erected a statue to Julia Lucilla, who had built public baths at Otricoli at her own expense.\n\nOTTER. See Mustela, Mammalia Index.\n\nOTTER OF ROSES. See Roses.\n\nOTTERBURN, in England, in the county of Northumberland, near Elvedon. It was the field of battle between the English and Scots in 1388, wherein Henry Percy, called Hotspur, was taken prisoner, and Douglas the Scotch general was killed. On this battle was founded the delightful old ballad of Chevy Chase; the village being situated by the river Rheid, on the south side of the Cheviot hills. The entrenchments are still visible; and a number of tumuli scattered over the adjacent ground mark to future ages the slaughter made there.\n\nOTTERY, ST MARY'S, a market town in Devonshire, situated 159 miles west of London, and 10 miles east of Exeter. The church is very ancient, and somewhat resembles a cathedral. A very extensive woollen manufactory was lately established here by Sir Geo. Yonge, and Sir John Dunlave, Barts. It has no corporation. It derived its name, as some suppose, from the river Otter, and that from the otters formerly found in it. This town was given by King Edward the Confessor to the church of St Mary at Roen in Normandy; but was afterwards bought by Grandison bishop of Exeter; who made it a quarter college in 10 Edward III. and therein placed peculiar profits, with other ministers, to whom he gave the whole manor, parish, tithes, fines, spiritual profits, &c. which amounted to 304l. 2s. 10d. yearly.\n\nOTWAY, THOMAS, an eminent tragic poet, was the son of Mr Humphrey Otway, rector of Wolbeding in Sussex; and was born at Trotton in that county on the 3d of March 1651. He was educated at Oxford; when, leaving the university without a degree, he retired to London, where he commenced player, but with indifferent success. However, the sprightliness of his conversation gained him the favour of Charles Fitz-Charles earl of Plymouth, who procured him a coronet's commission in one of the new-raised regiments sent into Flanders; but he returned from thence in very necessitous circumstances, and applied himself again to writing for the stage. In comedy he has been deemed too licentious; which, however, was no great objection to his pieces in the profligate days of Charles II. But, in tragedy, few English poets have ever excelled him; and perhaps none ever excelled him in touching the passions, particularly the tender passion. There is generally something familiar and domestic in the fable of his tragedies, and there is amazing energy in his expression.—The heart that doth not melt at the distresses of his Orphan must be hard indeed! But though Otway possessed in so eminent a degree the rare talent of writing to the heart, yet he was not very favourably regarded by some of his contemporary poets, nor was he always successful in his dramatic compositions. After experiencing many reverses of fortune in regard to his circumstances, but generally changing for the worse, he at last died wretchedly in a public house on Tower-hill; whither, it is supposed, he had retired, in order to avoid the prelude of his creditors. Some have said, that downright hunger compelling him to fall too eagerly on a piece of bread, of which he had been for some time in want, the first mouthful choked him, and instantly put a period to his days. Dr Johnson gives this account of the matter: \"He died in a manner which I am unwilling to mention. Having been compelled by his necessities to contract debts, and hunted, as is supposed by the terrours of the law, he retired to a public house on Tower-hill, where he died of want; or, as it is related by one of his biographers, by swallowing, after a long fast, a piece of bread which charity had supplied. He went out, as is reported, almost naked, in the rage of hunger, and finding a gentleman in a neighbouring coffee-house, asked him for a shilling. The gentleman gave him a guinea; and Otway going away bought a roll, and was choked with the first mouthful. All this, I hope, is not true; but that indigence, and its concomitants, sorrow and despondency, brought him to the grave, has never been denied.\"\n\nJohnson speaks of him in nearly these terms: Otway had not much cultivated verification, nor much replenished his mind with general knowledge. His principal power was in moving the passions, to which Dryden in his latter years left an illustrious testimony. He appears, by some of his verses, to have been a zealous royalist; and had what was in those times the common reward of loyalty; he lived and died neglected.—His dramatic writings are nine in number; the most admired of which are, The Orphan, and Venice Preserved. He had also made some translations, and wrote several miscellaneous poems. His whole works are printed in two pocket volumes. He wrote four acts of a play which are lost.\n\nOVAL, an oblong curvilinear figure, otherwise called ellipse. (See Ellipsis.) However, the proper oval, or egg shape, differs considerably from that of the ellipsis, being an irregular figure, narrower at one end than at another: whereas the ellipsis or mathematical oval, is equally broad at each end: though it must be owned, these two are commonly confounded together; even geometricians calling the oval a false ellipse.\n\nOVARY, in Anatomy, that part of a female animal wherein the ova or eggs are formed and lodged. See Anatomy, No. III.\n\nOVARIUM, in Botany, a name by which botanists who are fond of assimilating the animal and vegetable kingdoms have distinguished the germen or seed bud, as containing the rudiments of the future seed.\n\nOVATION, in the Roman antiquity, a laudatory triumph, allowed to commanders for victories won without the effusion of blood; or for defeating a mean and inconsiderable enemy. The show generally began at the Albanian mountain, whence the general with his retinue\nOVEN made his entry into the city on foot, with many flutes or pipes sounding in concert as he passed along, and wearing a garland or myrtle as a token of peace. The term ovation, according to Servius, is derived from ovus, a \"sheep;\" because on this occasion the conqueror sacrificed a sheep, as in triumph he sacrificed a bull. The senate, knights, and principal plebeians, assisted at the procession; which concluded at the Capitol, where rams were sacrificed to Jupiter. The first ovation was granted to Publius Posthumius the consul, for his victory over the Sabines in the 253rd year of Rome.\n\nOUDÉ, a province of Hindoostan Proper, subject to a nabob, whose dominions lie on both sides of the Ganges, occupying the flat country between that river and the northern mountains, as well as the principal part of that fertile tract, lying between the Ganges and Jumna, known by the name of Doaba, to within 40 miles of the city Delhi. Oude and its dependencies are computed at about 360 miles long from east to west, and 180 broad. A brigade of the Bengal army is constantly stationed on the western frontier, answering the double purpose of covering both Oude and Bengal; in consideration of which the nabob pays an annual subsidy of 420,000l. sterling. The capital of the province is Lucknow. Oude is also the name of a city in the above province, said to have been the principal city of Hindoostan about 1200 years before the Christian era.\n\nOUDENARDE, a rich and strong town of the Austrian Netherlands, in the province of Flanders, in E. Long. 3° 30'. N. Lat. 50° 54'. fifteen miles south of Ghent, and eighteen from Tournay. It is a large well fortified town, having a very considerable fort in the middle of it, situated on the river Scheldt, which divides it into two parts. It is almost encompassed by meadows, only there is a hill which commands it on the south side. The buildings are pretty good, and the streets wide and handsome. The market-place is adorned with a beautiful town-house, and a fine large fountain. There are several good churches and monasteries well worthy of the notice of travellers. The town has a very flourishing trade in fine linen and tapestry, and is the capital of a canton, which contains 33 villages. The French laid siege to it in 1708, which brought on an obstinate engagement, wherein they were defeated by the allies under the command of the duke of Marlborough. It was besieged by the French again in 1744, and taken in a few days; but it was restored at the general peace.\n\nOVEN, a kind of domestic furnace, used for baking bread, pies, tarts, &c. of a circular structure, with a very low roof, well lined, both on the top, bottom, and sides, with stone; it has a small entrance in the front, which is exactly fitted by a kind of door, which being clapped to the mouth of the oven confines the heat, while bread, pies, or puddings, are baking. Over this, pastry cooks, &c. have another oven built much in the same manner, which is used for such things as require a less degree of heat. Ovens are heated by burning dry wood, faggots, &c. in them, till all the parts are equally hot.\n\nOVERALL, JOHN, a celebrated English bishop, was born in 1559; and, after a proper foundation in grammar learning, was sent to St John's college, Cambridge, and was elected a scholar of that society: but afterwards removing to Trinity, was chosen fellow of Overall college. In 1596 he was made regius professor of divinity, when he took the degree of D.D. and about the same time was elected master of Catherine-hall. In 1601 he was raised to the deanship of St Paul's, London, by the recommendation of his patron Sir Fulke Greville, and Queen Elizabeth; and in the beginning of King James's reign, he was chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation. In 1612 he was appointed one of the first governors of the Charter-house hospital, then just founded by Thomas Sutton, Esq. In April 1614 he was made bishop of Litchfield and Coventry; and in 1618 he was translated to Norwich, where he died in May 1619, aged, as it is reported, 60 years. He was buried in that cathedral, where he lay unnoticed and forgotten till some time after the restoration of Charles II. when Cofin, bishop of Durham, who had been his secretary, erected a monument in 1669, with a Latin inscription, in which he is said to be, \"Vir unaeque docilimus, et omni inomio major.\"\n\nWood observes, that he had the character of being the best scholastic divine in England; and Cofin, who perhaps may be thought to rival him in that sort of learning, calls himself his scholar, and absolutely says that he derived all his knowledge from him. He is also celebrated by Smith for his distinguished wisdom, erudition, and piety. In the controversy which in his time divided the reformed churches about predestination and grace, he held a middle opinion, inclining perhaps to Arminianism. He seems indeed to have paved the way for the reception of that doctrine in England, where it was generally embraced a few years afterwards, chiefly by the authority and influence of Archbishop Laud. Overall cultivated a particular friendship with Gerard Vossius and Grotius; and was much grieved to see the love of peace, and the projects of this last great man to obtain it, fo ill repaid. He laboured heartily himself to settle the differences in Holland, upon what is known by the name of the Quinquaricular controversy; as appears in part by his letters to the two learned correspondents just mentioned, some of which are printed in the Epistolae praefiantium virorum, &c.\n\nThe bishop is known in England chiefly by his Convocation Book, of which Bishop Burnet gives the following account: \"This book was wrote on the subject of government, the divine institution of which was very positively affected. It was read in convocation, and passed by that body, in order to the publishing of it; in opposition to the principles laid down in the famous book of Parsons the Jesuit, published under the name of Doleman. But King James did not like a convocation entering into such a theory of politics; so he discouraged the printing of it, especially since, in order to justify the owning of the United Provinces, who had lately thrown off the Spanish yoke, to be a lawful government, it was laid down, that when a change of government was brought to a thorough settlement, it was then to be owned and submitted to as work of the providence of God. Here it slept, till Archbishop Sancroft, who had got the book into his own hands, and not observing the last-mentioned passage in it, resolved to publish it in the beginning of King William's reign, as an authentic declaration the church of England had made in the point\nOverbury, Sir Thomas, a learned Englishman, was born in 1581; and studied at Queen's college, Oxford, after which he removed to the Middle-Temple, London. He afterwards travelled for some time, and returned a most accomplished person; when he contracted an intimate acquaintance with Sir Robert Carr, knight of the Bath, who being soon after taken into his majesty's favour, had Mr Overbury knighted at Greenwich. Sir Thomas perceiving the familiarity which subsisted between his patron Carr, now made Viscount Rochester, and the lady Frances, the wife of Robert earl of Essex, was so much displeased at it, that he endeavoured to dissuade him from keeping her company, and from proceeding in the base design he had formed of having her first divorced from her husband, and then marrying her. The viscount, refuting this honest advice, told what he had said to the lady, who was as remarkable for her wickedness as for her beauty; on which they immediately resolved on his destruction. About this time, the king wanting to send an ambassador abroad, the viscount recommended Sir Thomas Overbury. His majesty approving the choice, the viscount imparted the king's intentions to Sir Thomas; but, under a treacherous show of friendship, dissuaded him from accepting of that employment, as it might hinder him from a better way of advancement; promising that he would prevent his majesty from being displeased at his refusal. The viscount then went to the king, and artfully incensing his majesty against Sir Thomas for refusing to obey his commands, that gentleman was committed to the Tower for his contempt, on the 21st of April 1613, where he continued till he was despatched by poison on the 15th of September following, and his body was interred in the Tower-chapel the same day. About two years after, the whole contrivance of his death was discovered. On this several persons were condemned and executed; but though Carr, earl of Somerset, and the lady Frances his countess, were condemned to death for contriving the murder, and hiring the persons who were concerned in it, the king only banished them from court, and afterwards pardoned them. Sir Thomas Overbury wrote several poems, &c. and an account of his travels.\n\nHis character is represented by a historian of those times; who, after relating the occasion and circumstances of his death, proceeds in the following terms:\n\n\"In this manner fell Sir Thomas Overbury, worthy of a longer life and a better fate; and, if I may compare private men with princes, like Germanicus Caesar, both by poison procured by the malice of a woman, both about the 33rd year of their age, and both celebrated for their skill and judgement in poetry, their learning, and their wisdom. Overbury was a gentleman of an ancient family, but had some blemishes charged upon his character, either through a too great ambition, or the insolence of a haughty temper.\"\n\nAfter the return from his travels, the viscount Rochester embraced him with so entire a friendship, that exercising by his majesty's special favour the office of secretary provisionally, he not only communicated to Sir Thomas the secrets, but many times gave him the Over-hauling packets and letters unopened, before they had been perused by the king himself: which as it prevailed too much upon his early years, so as to make him, in the opinion of some, thought high and ambitious; yet he was so far from violating his trust and confidence, that he remains now one example among others who have suffered in their persons or their fortunes for a freedom of advice, which none but sincere friends will give, and which many are such ill friends to themselves as not to receive.\"\n\nOVER-HAULING, the act of opening and extending the several parts of a tackle, or other assemblage of ropes, communicating with blocks or dead eyes. It is used to remove those blocks to a sufficient distance from each other, that they may be again placed in a state of action, so as to produce the effect required.\n\nOVER-Hauling, is also vulgarly expressed of an examination or inspection into the condition of a person or thing.\n\nOVER-Rake, among seamen: When a ship riding at anchor so overbeats herself into a high sea, that she is walked by the waves breaking in upon her, they say the waves over-rake her.\n\nOVERSMAN, in Scots Law, a person appointed by arbitrors, or by the parties submitting, to determine the matter submitted, in case the arbitrors disagree in their opinion.\n\nOVERT, the same with OPEN: Thus an overt act signifies an act which, in law, must be clearly proved; and such is to be alleged in every indictment for high treason.\n\nOVERTURE, or OUVERTURR, opening or prelude; a term used for the solemnities at the beginning of a public act or ceremony; an opera, tragedy, comedy, concert of music, &c. The overture of the theatre or scene, is a piece of music usually ending with a fugue: the overture of a jubilee is a general procession, &c.\n\nOVERYSSEL, so named from its situation beyond the river Yssel, one of the Seven United Provinces; bounded on the east by the bishopric of Munster, on the north by Frieland and the territory of Groningen, on the west by the river Yssel, and on the south by the county of Zutphen and the bishopric of Munster. It is divided into three distinct parts; which are the territories of Drenthe, Twente, and Salland. There are many marshes in this province, and but few inhabitants, in comparison of the rest. Its greatest riches consist in turfs; which are dug up here, and sent to the neighbouring provinces, particularly Holland. It extends near 60 miles in length from north to south, and 40 in breadth from east to west. The whole country is low and marshy, but it produces a tolerable quantity of corn. It was formerly a dependance of the bishopric of Utrecht, before Henry of Bavaria, bishop of that see, transferred the sovereignty of it to the emperor Charles V.\n\nOVIEDA, a genus of the angiospermia order, belonging to the didynamia class of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, Peronaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nOVIEDO, a town of Spain, and capital of Asturias d'Orviedo, with a bishop's see, and an university; seated at the confluence of the rivers Ove and Deva, which\nOvid, which form the Asta, 50 miles north-west of Leon, and\n238 north-west of Madrid. W. Long. 5° 47'. N. Lat.\n43° 23'.\n\nOUGHTRED, WILLIAM, an eminent mathematician, was born at Eton in 1573, and educated in the school there, whence he was elected to King's College in Cambridge, of which he afterwards became fellow. Being admitted to holy orders, he left the university about the year 1623, and was presented to the rectory of Aldbury, near Guildford in Surrey; and about the year 1628 was appointed by the earl of Arundel to instruct his son in the mathematics. He kept a correspondence by letters with some of the most eminent scholars of his time upon mathematical subjects; and the most celebrated mathematicians of that age owed most of their skill to him, whose house was full of young gentlemen that came from all parts to receive his instruction. It is said that, upon hearing the news of the vote at Westminster for the restoration of King Charles II., he expired in a sudden transport of joy, aged 88. He wrote, 1. Clavis Mathematica; which was afterwards published in England. 2. A description of the double horizontal dial. 3. Opuscula Mathematica; and several other works. He left also behind him a great number of papers upon mathematical subjects, which are now in the museum of William Jones, Esq., F.R.S.\n\nDavid Lloyd, in his Memoirs, has given the following short character of him: \"That he was as facetious in Greek and Latin, as solid in arithmetic, geometry, and the sphere of all measures, music, &c., exact in his style as in his judgment; handling his tube and other instruments at so as steadily as others did at 30; owning this, as he said, to temperance and archery; principling his people with plain and solid truths, as he did the world with great and useful arts; advancing new inventions in all things but religion, which, in its old order and decency, he maintained secure in his privacy, prudence, meekness, simplicity, resolution, patience, and contentment.\" He had one son; whom he put an apprentice to a watchmaker, and wrote a book of instructions in that art for his use.\n\nOVID, or Publius OVIDIUS NASO, a celebrated Latin poet of the Augustan age, was a Roman knight, born at Sulmo, in the 43rd year before the Christian era. He studied rhetoric under Archias Puteanus, and for some time frequented the bar. His progress in the study of eloquence was great, but the father's expectations were frustrated; his son was born a poet, and nothing could deter him from pursuing his natural inclination to write poetry, though he was often reminded that Homer lived and died in the greatest poverty. Everything he wrote was expressed in poetical numbers, as he himself says, Et quod tentalam scribere verum erat: A lively genius and a fertile imagination soon gained him admirers; the learned became his friends: Virgil, Propertius, Tibullus, and Horace, honoured him with their correspondence, and Augustus patronized him with the most unbounded liberality. These favours, however, were but momentary; for after having obtained the esteem of Augustus, he incurred his displeasure, and was banished to Tomos, a city on the Pontus Euxinus, near the mouth of the Danube, when he was 50 years of age. The true cause of this sudden exile is unknown. Some attribute it to a shameful amour with Livia the wife of Augustus, while others suppose that it arose from the knowledge which Ovid had of the unpardonable incest of the emperor with his daughter Julia. These reasons are indeed merely conjectural; the cause was of a very private and very secret nature, of which Ovid himself is afraid to speak. It was, however, something improper in the family and court of Augustus, as these lines seem to indicate:\n\nCur altiquid vidit? Cur noxia lumina feci?\nCur imprudente cognita culpa mihi est?\nInfectus Athenaeo vidit sine septe Dionam,\nPrada fuit canibus non minus ille fuis.\n\nAgain,\n\nInscia quod crimenviderunt lumina phlebor,\nPecuniamque oculos eft habuisse meum.\n\nAnd in another place,\n\nPerdiderunt cum me duo crimina, carmen et error,\nAlierius facti culpa filenda mihi est.\n\nIn his banishment, Ovid betrayed his puffianimity in a great degree; and however affected and distressed his situation was, yet the flattery and impatience which he showed in his writings are a disgrace to his pen, and lay him more open to ridicule than to pity. Though he profited his pen and his time to adulation, yet the emperor proved deaf to all entreaties, and refused to listen to his most ardent friends at Rome who wished for his return. Ovid, who really wished for a Brutus to deliver Rome of her tyrannical Augustus, still continued his flattery even to meanest; and when the emperor died, he was so mercenary as to consecrate a small temple to the departed tyrant on the shores of the Euxine, where he regularly offered frankincense every morning. Tiberius proved as regardless as his predecessor for the entreaties which were made for the poet, and he died in the seventh or eighth year of his banishment, in the 57th year of his age. He was buried at Tomos. In the year 158 of the Christian era, the following epitaph was discovered at Stain, in the modern kingdom of Austria.\n\nHic situs est vates quem Divi Caesaris ira,\nAngusti patria celebre jussit lauro.\nSepe miter voluit patris occumbere terris,\nSed fruatur! hunc illi fata dedere locum.\n\nThis, however, is an imposition to render celebrated an obscure corner of the world, which never contained the bones of Ovid. The greatest part of his poems are remaining. His Metamorphoses, in 15 books, are extremely curious, on account of the great variety of mythological facts and traditions which they relate, but they can have no claim to epic honours. In composing this the poet was more indebted to the existing traditions, and to the theogony of the ancients, than the powers of his own imagination. His Fasti were divided into 12 books, like the constellations in the zodiac, but of these six are lost; and the learned world have reason to lament the loss of a poem which must have thrown so much light upon the religious rites and ceremonies, festivals and sacrifices, of the ancient Romans; as we may judge from the fix that have survived the ravages of time and barbarity. His Tristia,\nOVILIA, or SEPTA, in ancient Rome, a place in the Campus Martius, at first raised in like a fleecy pen, whence its name. Afterwards it was mounted with marble, and beautified with walks and galleries, as also with a tribunal, or seat of justice. Within this precinct or inclosure the people were called to give their suffrages for the election of magistrates. The ascent into the ovilia was not by stairs, but by pontes, or narrow boards, laid there for the occasion; on which account, de ponte decipi signifies \"to be deprived of the privilege of voting;\" and persons thus dealt with were called deportant.\n\nOVIPAROUS, a term applied to such animals as bring forth their young from eggs; as birds, insects, &c.\n\nOVIS, the SHEEP, a genus of the mammalia class, and of the order of Pecora. See MAMMALIA Index.\n\nOUNCE, a weight, the 16th part of a pound avoirdupois, and the 12th part of a pound troy. The word is derived from the Latin, uncia, \"the twelfth part of any whole,\" called as; particularly in geometrical measures, an inch, or 12th part of a foot. See INCH and AS.\n\nOUNCE. See FELIS, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nOVOLO, or OVUM, in Architecture, a round moulding, whose profile or sweep, in the Ionic and Composite capitals, is usually a quadrant of a circle: whence it is also commonly called the quarter-round. It is usually cut with representations of eggs and arrow-heads or anchors placed alternately.\n\nOU-POEY-TSE, a name given by the Chinese to a kind of nests made by certain insects upon the leaves and branches of the tree called yen-fou-tse. These nests are much used in dyeing, and the physicians employ them for curing many distempers. Some of these nests were brought to Europe, and put into the hands of the celebrated Mr Geoffroy. After having examined them with the utmost attention, this learned academician thought he perceived some conformity in them to those excrescences which grow on the leaves of the elm, and which the vulgar call elm-bladders: he found these nests so sharp and astringent to the taste, that he considered them as far superior to every other species of galls used by the dyers. According to him, they are the strongest astringents existing in the vegetable kingdom.\n\nIt is certain that there is a great affinity between the ou-poey-tse and the elm-bladders. The form of both is unequal and irregular; they are covered on the outside with a short down, which renders them soft to the touch; within they are full of a whitish-grey dust, in which may be observed the dried remains of small insects, without discovering any aperture through which they might have passed. These nests or bladders harden as they grow old; and their substance, which appears resinous, becomes brittle and transparent; however, the Chinese do\nnot consider the ou-poey-tfe, notwithstanding their resemblance to elm-bladders, as excrescences of the tree yen-fou-tfe, upon which they are found. They are persuaded, that insects produce a kind of wax, and construct for themselves on the branches and leaves of this tree (the sap of which is proper for their nourishment) little retreats, where they may wait for the time of their metamorphosis, or at least deposit in safety their eggs, which compose that fine dust with which the ou-poey-tfe are filled. Some of the ou-poey-tfe are as large as one's fist; but these are rare, and are generally produced by a worm of extraordinary strength, or which has associated with another, as two silk worms are sometimes seen shut up in the same ball. The smallest ou-poey-tfe are of the size of a chestnut; the greater part of them are round and oblong; but they seldom resemble one another entirely in their exterior configuration. At first, they are of a dark green colour, which afterwards changes to yellow; and the husk, though pretty firm, becomes then very brittle.\n\nThe Chinese peasants collect these ou-poey-tfe before the first harvests. They take care to kill the worm inclosed in the husks, and to expose them for some time to the steam of boiling water. Without this precaution, the worm might soon break through its weak prison, which would immediately burst and be useless. The ou-poey-tfe are used at Pekin for giving paper a durable and deep-black colour; in the provinces of Kiang-nan and Tche-kiang, where a great deal of beautiful satin is made, they are employed for dyeing the silk before it is put on the loom. The Chinese literati also blacken their beards with them when they become white.\n\nThe medicinal properties of the ou-poey-tfe are very numerous. The Chinese physicians introduce them into the composition of many of their remedies. They recommend them for stopping bleedings of every kind; they consider them as an excellent specific for curing inflammations and ulcers, and for counteracting the effects of poison; and they employ them with success in the dropsy, phthisis, epilepsy, catarrhs, sicknesses, fluxions of the eyes and ears, and in many other disorders.\n\nGreater Ouse, a river which rises near Fitwell in Oxfordshire, and proceeds to Buckingham, Stony-Stratford, and Newport-Pagnell, in Buckinghamshire; from thence it proceeds to Bedford, and turning north-east it passes on to Huntingdon and Ely, till at length it arrives at Lynn-Regis in Norfolk, and falls into the sea. It is navigable to some distance above Downham, where there is a good harbour for barges; and a considerable trade is carried on by it to Lynn and other towns.\n\nSmaller Ouse, rises in Suffolk, and, separating that county from Norfolk on the south-west, discharges itself into the great Ouse near Downham. There is still another of the same name which rises in the west-north-west side of Yorkshire; and chiefly running to the south-east, at length falls into the Humber.\n\nOuster, or Dispossession, in Law, an injury which carries with it the amotion of possession; for by means of it the wrong done gets into the actual possession of the land or hereditament, and obliges him that hath a right to seek a legal remedy, in order to gain possession, together with damages. This ouster may either be of the freehold by abatement, intrusion, defeit, discontinuance, and deforcement, or of chattels real, as an estate by statute-merchant, statute-fimple, or eject, or an estate for years.\n\nOuster le Main, amovere manum, in Law, denotes a livery of lands out of the king's hands; or a judgment given for him that traversed, or sued, a movéran le droit. When it appeared, upon the matter being difficult, that the king had no right or title to the land feigned, judgment was given in chancery, that the king's hand be removed; and ouster le main, or amoveas manum, was therefore awarded to the escheator, to restore the land, &c. All wardships, liveries, ouster le mains, &c., are now taken away and discharged by statute 12 Car. II.\n\nOustioug, a town of the Russian empire, and capital of a province of the same name, with an archbishop's see and a castle; seated on the river Suchan, over-against the mouth of the Jug, in E. Long. 43° 25' N. Lat. 61° 48'.\n\nOustioug, a province of the Russian empire, bounded on the north by Dwina, on the east by the forest of Zirani, on the south by Wologda, and on the west by Cargapol and Waga. It is divided into two parts by the river Suchana; is full of forests; and the rivers yield plenty of fish, which the inhabitants dry in the sun, and which make their principal nourishment.\n\nOut-rosts, in a military service, a body of men posted beyond the grand guard, called out-polls, as being the rounds or limits of the camp.\n\nOutlaw, signifies one that is deprived of the benefit of the law, and therefore held to be out of the king's protection.\n\nBracton affirms, that an outlaw forfeits all he has; and that, from the time of his outlawry, he wears a wolf's head; and any body may kill him with impunity, especially if he defend himself or fly. But in Edward III.'s time it was resolved by the judges, that it should not be lawful for any man, but the sheriff alone (having sufficient warrant for it), to put to death a man that was outlawed.\n\nOutlawry, the punishment of a person who being called into law, and lawfully, according to the usual forms, sought, does contumaciously refuse to appear.\n\nThe effect of being outlawed at the suit of another, in a civil cause, is the forfeiture of all the person's goods and chattels to the king, and the profits of his land, while the outlawry remains in force. If in treason or felony, all the lands and tenements which he has in fee, or for life, and all his goods and chattels, are also forfeited; and besides, the law interprets his absence as a sufficient evidence of guilt; and without requiring further proof, accounts the person guilty of the fact, on which ensues corruption of blood, &c. And then, according to Bracton, he may perish without law, &c. However, to avoid inhumanity, no man is intitled to kill him wantonly or wilfully; but in so doing he is guilty of murder, unless it happens in endeavouring to apprehend him; for any body may arrest an outlaw, either of his own head, or by writ or warrant of capias utlagatum, in order to bring him to execution.\n\nIf after outlawry, in civil cases, the defendant publicly appear, he is to be arrested by a writ of capias utlagatum, and committed till the outlawry be reversed: which reversal may be had by the defendant's appearing in court (and in the king's-bench, by sending an attorney, according to statute 4 and 5 W. and M. cap. 18.)\nOWEN\n\nany plausible circumstance, however trifling, is in general sufficient to reverse it; it being considered only as a process to force appearance. The defendant must, however, pay full costs, and must put the plaintiff in the same condition as if he had appeared before the writ of evig facias was awarded. It is appointed by magna carta, that no freeman shall be outlawed, but according to the law of the land. A minor or a woman cannot be outlawed.\n\nIn Scotland outlawry anciently took place in the case of refusal to fulfil a civil obligation, as well as in criminal cases. At present, however, it only takes place in the two cases of flying from a criminal prosecution, and of appearing in court attended by too great a number of followers. But the defender, upon appearing at any distance of time and offering to stand trial, is entitled de jure to have the outlawry reversed, and to be admitted to trial accordingly, and even to bail if the offence be bailable.

Having taken a degree in arts, he left the university, and entered himself of Lincoln's Inn in London, where in process of time he became an eminent counsellor. In 1583 he was elected Lent-reader to that society. In 1592 he was made sergeant-at-law, and queen's sergeant soon after. He arrived at length at the dignity of judge of the common pleas; which office he is said to have executed, during five years, with great abilities and integrity. He died in 1598; and was buried on the south side of the choir in Westminster Abbey, where a monument was erected to his memory. He had the reputation of a learned man, and a patron of literature. He was the author of \"Reports in the common pleas, wherein are many choice cases, most of them thoroughly argued by the learned sergeants, and after argued and resolved by the grave judges of those times, with many cases wherein the difference of the year-books are reconciled and explained.\" Lond. 1616, folio.\n\nOWEN, Dr John, an eminent and learned dissenting minister, was born in 1616, at Hadham, in Oxfordshire, of which place his father was vicar. He made such surprising proficiency in learning, that at twelve years of age he was admitted into Queen's College, Oxford, and in 1635 was made master of arts: but soon after, disapproving the new regulations made by Archbishop Laud their chancellor, with which he refused to comply, he was obliged, in 1637, to leave the university; when, taking orders, he became chaplain to Sir Robert Dormer of Ascot in Oxfordshire, and was at the same time tutor to his eldest son. He was afterwards chaplain to John Lord Lovelace of Hurley in Berkshire; when the civil war broke out, he openly avowed the cause of the parliament; which was so resented by an uncle, who had intended to leave him his estate, that he discarded him, and left it to another. Yet though Lord Lovelace joined the king, he treated his chaplain with great civility: but on his taking the field with the royal army, Mr Owen went to London, and soon after joined the non-conformists. In 1642 he published his book, intitled, A Display of Arminianism, which laid the foundation of his future advancement: for the committee for purging the church of scandalous ministers were so pleased with it, that Mr White their chairman sent him a presentation of the living of Fordham in Essex: but when he had been there about a year and a half, the patron hearing that the feigned incumbent was dead, presented another to the living; upon which the earl of Warwick gave Mr Owen the living of Coggeshall. He had not, however, been long at that town before he left the Presbyterians; and, joining the Independents, formed a church there. He was now sent for several times to preach before the parliament; and among the rest on the 28th of February 1648-9, the day of humiliation for the intended expedition to Ireland. Cromwell, who was present at this last discourse, and had never heard him before, was extremely pleased with it, and desired his company into Ireland, and that he would reside in the college of Dublin. This he did; but returned in about half a year. Soon after Cromwell sent him into Scotland; but he also returned from thence after about half a year's stay at Edinburgh. He was then promoted to the deanery of Christ-church, Oxford, whither he went in 1651; and Cromwell, being now chancellor of the university, nominated him his vice-chancellor. The next year he was created doctor of divinity by diploma. Dr Owen enjoyed the post of vice-chancellor five years; during which he behaved with the greatest moderation; for, though often solicited, he never molested the meetings of the royalists at the house of Dr Willis the physician, where divine service was performed according to the liturgy of the church of England; and though he was a commissioner for ejecting scandalous ministers, he frequently overruled his brethren in favour of those royalists who were distinguished by their merit. At the death of Cromwell, he was removed from the vice-chancellorship; and at the Restoration was ejected from his deanery of Christ-church. But he had provided himself a comfortable retreat at an estate he had purchased at Hadham. He now employed himself in preaching as often as he had an opportunity, and in writing books; one of which, intitled Fiat Lux, falling into the hands of Lord Clarendon, he was so pleased with it, or (as is said) from policy pretended to be so, that he sent for Dr Owen, and acknowledging the service he had done by it to the Protestant religion, offered to prefer him in the church if he would conform; but he desired to be excused.—His moderation drew him respect from persons of opposite principles; and in the number of his friends were Dr Wilkins bishop of Chester, and Dr Barlow bishop of London. He died at Ealing in 1683. His works are printed in seven volumes folio.\n\nWood, after censuring him in many respects, says nevertheless, that, \"to speak impartially, he was a person well skilled in the tongues, Rabbinical learning, and Jewish rites and customs; that he had a great command of his English pen, and was one of the gentlest and fairest writers who have appeared against the church of England.\"\n\nOWHYHEE, the easternmost, and by far the largest, of the Sandwich islands. Its greatest length from north to south is 28½ leagues, its breadth 24, and its circumference...\nOwhyhee circumference nearly 300 English miles. It is divided into six large districts; two of which on the north-east side are separated by a mountain, that rises in three peaks, which is perpetually covered with snow, and may be seen clearly at 40 leagues distance. To the north of this mountain, the coast consists of high and steep cliffs, down which fall many beautiful cascades of water. The whole country is covered with cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees. The peaks of the mountain on the north-east side appear to be about half a mile in height, and entirely covered with snow. To the south of this mountain, the coast presents a prospect of the most dreary kind, the whole country appearing to have undergone a total change by means of some dreadful convulsion. The ground is everywhere covered with cinders, and intersected in many places with black streaks, which seem to mark the course of a lava that has flowed not many ages since from the mountain to the shore. The northern promontory looks like the mere dreary of a volcano. The projecting headland is composed of broken and craggy rocks, piled irregularly one upon another, terminating in sharp points; yet amidst their ruins, there are many pieces of rich soil, which are carefully laid out in plantations, and the neighbouring sea affords a vast variety of excellent fish: so that this quarter is much better inhabited than those which are more verdant. The fields are inclosed with stone fences, and are interspersed with groves of cocoa nut trees. We are told indeed by some of Cook's people who walked through a considerable part of it, that they did not observe a foot of ground, that was susceptible of improvement left unplanted; and indeed the country, from their account, could scarcely be cultivated to greater advantage for the purposes of the natives. They were surprised at seeing several fields of hay; and upon their inquiry, to what particular use it was applied, they were informed, that it was intended to cover the grounds where the young taro grew, in order to preserve them from being scorched by the rays of the sun. They observed among the plantations a few huts scattered about, which afforded occasional shelter to the labourers; but they did not see any villages at a greater distance from the sea than four or five miles. Near one of these, which was situated about four miles from the bay, they discovered a cave forty fathoms in length, three in breadth, and of the same height. It was open at each end; its sides were fluted as if wrought with a chisel; and the surface was glazed over, perhaps by the action of fire. There are supposed to be on this island about 150,000 inhabitants. So long as the name of Captain Cook shall be remembered, this island will not be forgotten; for he here fell a victim to a strange concatenation of events. See Cook.\n\nWe have the following account of the inhabitants of this island in Ellis's Authentic Narrative, &c. \"The men are above the middle size, stout, well made, and fleety, but not fat. Corpulency is not altogether so great a mark of distinction in these as in the Society Isles; and tallness, for which the Otaheiteans have great partiality, is also overlooked. Their colour is in general brown olive. The women are in general masculine, though there are some delicately made, and the voice of them all is soft and feminine. The hair both of the head and beard is black; that of the head the men wear in the form of a helmet, that is, a long frizzled ridge extending from the forehead to the neck, the sides being much shorter. This fashion seems to prevail only among the principal people, that of the inferior sort being of an equal length in every part. Most of them were very desirous of parting with their beards, which, they said, were disagreeable and troublesome, and were fond of being shaved by our people. Some of the priests wore their beards long, and would not on any account part with them. The women wear their hair long before, but very short behind, which is not the most becoming mode; and, like those of the Friendly Isles, they have a way of rendering it of different colours, red, yellow, and brown. The features of both sexes are good, and we saw some of the females who might really be called fine women. Their teeth are even and perfectly white. In general, they seem to be very healthy, and we observed several who appeared to be of great age. As to diseases, we saw none who laboured under any during our stay, except the venereal complaint; coughs and colds indeed were pretty general, and one man died. From what we could learn of his disorder from the natives, it was a violent griping or colic.\n\nBoth men and women appeared to be of a good disposition, and behaved to each other with the tenderest regard: when they did fall out, which sometimes was the case, occasioned by the upsetting of a canoe, or some such trifling accident, they only scolded a little, and this was soon over and forgotten. We never saw them strike each other upon any occasion. They are all thieves, from the tree to the towlow, but not quite so expert at it as our Otaheite friends.\n\nThe custom of tattooing prevails greatly among these people, but the men have a much larger share of it than the women; many (particularly some of the natives of Bow'where) have one half their body, from head to foot, marked in this manner, which gives them a most striking appearance. It is done with great regularity, and looks remarkably neat: some have only an arm marked in this manner, others a leg; some again have both arm and leg, and others only the hand. The women are for the most part marked upon the tip of their tongue; but of these we saw but few. Both sexes have a particular mark according to the district in which they live; or it is rather the mark of the aroo, or principal man, under whose jurisdiction they reside immediately are. We never saw the operation of tattooing performed, nor could we procure a sight of the instruments used upon this occasion; but it is likely they are much the same as those of the Friendly and Society Isles.\n\nBoth men and women are very cleanly in their persons; the latter wash their whole bodies in fresh water twice and sometimes three times a day; but the women of Otaheite have the advantage of them in one point of cleanliness, which is eradicating the hairs from under the arm-pits. This is a custom we observed nowhere but at the Society Isles.\n\nThere are no people in the world who indulge themselves more in their sensual appetite than these: in fact, they carry it to a most scandalous and shameful degree, and in a manner not proper to be mentioned. The ladies are very lavish of their favours; but are far from being so mercenary as those of the Friendly or Society Isles, and some of their attachments seemed purely the effect\nTheir clothing consists of cloth of different kinds: that worn by the men, which is called marro, is about half a yard wide, and four yards long; that of the women three quarters of a yard wide, and of the same length as the men's: this they call pal-owawa; they both wear it round their middle, but the men pass it between their legs. This is the general dress of both sexes; but the better sort sometimes throw a large piece loosely over their shoulders. Besides the marro, they have several other kinds of cloth, which derive their names either from the different uses they are applied to, or their different texture and patterns; all, however, as far as we could learn, are made from the Chinese paper, a liberty tree. The principal of these is the cappa, which is about 10 or 12 feet long, and nearly as many wide, and is thick and warm; they wrap themselves up in this when they retire to sleep. They have another kind, which is white, and much thinner; this, as has been before observed, they throw loosely over their shoulder; it is sometimes 20 or 35 yards long, and wide in proportion. The marro and pah-owawa are curiously painted of various patterns, but the others are generally white, or dyed red, black, and yellow.\n\nThe principal ornaments of the men are the feather caps and cloaks; some of the latter reach down to their heels, and have a most magnificent appearance. They are made for the most part of red and yellow feathers, which are tied upon fine net-work. The caps are composed of the same kind of feathers, which are sometimes intermixed with black; they are secured upon a kind of basket-work, made in the form of a helmet. Both caps and cloaks are made of various patterns and sizes. The cloaks are not all composed of the same kind of feathers, but are sometimes varied with the long tail feathers of the cock, with a border of yellow or red, and sometimes with those of the tropic bird. Both caps and cloaks, however, are only to be seen in the possession of the principal people. They have also a kind of fly-flap, made of a bunch of feathers fixed to the end of a thin piece of smooth and polished wood: they are generally made of the tail feathers of the cock, but the better sort of people have them of the tropic bird's feathers, or those belonging to a black and yellow bird called mohó. The handle is very frequently made of one of the bones of the arms or leg of those whom they have killed in battle, curiously inlaid with tortoise-shell; these they deem very valuable, and will not part with them under a great price. This ornament is common to the superiors of both sexes.\n\nThe women too have their share in the ornamental way: that which they value most is the ori. This is a kind of ruff or necklace, made of red, green, black, and yellow feathers, curiously put together, and in most elegant patterns, which really do honour to the fancy of the ladies, whose business it is to make them. They never think themselves drearied without one or two of these round their necks, and those who can afford it wear many. Others again are composed of small variegated shells, disposed in a very neat manner; and some consist of several rows of twisted hair, with a piece of carved wood or bone, highly polished, the bottom part forming a curve. The higher the quality of the wearer, the greater is the size of the wood or bone, and the quantity of the twisted hair. The next thing is the poo-remah or bracelet; the most valuable are made of boar's tusks fastened together side by side with a piece of string, by means of a hole drilled through the middle; the larger the tusks, the greater the value. Sometimes two tusks, tied round the wrists with twisted or braided hair, serve the purpose of bracelets; but even in this case they show great nicety, being particularly careful to match them as near as possible. They were prodigiously fond of those we gave them, which were only a few beads, secured by thread upon a strip of finest cloth, and made to button round the wrist. So much did they at first value them, that a small hatchet and one of these would purchase a hog, which without it could not have been bought for three large hatchets. The women were perpetually teasing the men to dispose of their various articles for these bracelets; at least one of them was always to make a part of the price.\" W. Long, 1560. N.

See STRIX, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nOWLING, so called from its being usually carried on in the night, is the offence of transporting wool or sheep out of this kingdom, to the detriment of its staple manufacture. This was forbidden at common law, and more particularly by statute 1 Edw. I. 1. c. 1. when the importance of our woollen manufacture was first attended to; and there are now many later statutes relating to this offence, the most useful and principal of which are those enacted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and since. The statute 8 Eliz. c. 3. makes the transportation of live sheep, or embarking them on board any ship, for the first offence forfeiture of goods, and imprisonment for a year, and that at the end of the year the left hand shall be cut off in some public market, and shall be there nailed up in the openest place; and the second offence is felony. The statutes 12 Car. II. c. 32. and 7 & 8 Will. III. c. 28. make the exportation of wool, sheep, or fullers earth, liable to pecuniary penalties, and the forfeiture of the interest of the ship and cargo by the owners, if privy; and confiscation of goods, and three years imprisonment to the master and all the mariners. And the statute 4 Geo. I. c. 11. (amended and further enforced by 12 Geo. II. c. 21. and 19 Geo. II. c. 34.), makes it transportation for seven years, if the penalties be not paid.\n\nOXALIS, wood sorrel, a genus of plants belonging to the decandra clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 14th order, Grainales. See Botany Index.\n\nOXFORD, the capital of a county of the same name in England, celebrated for its university, and pleasantly situated in a plain, in the middle of a fine fruitful country. The composition of the name is obvious. In the British times it seems to have been a place of study. \"The wisdom of our ancestors (says Camden) as appears in our history, consecrated even in the British times this city to the muses, translating them from Greece-lade (now a small town in Wales) hither, as to a more fruitful manufactory. For Alexander Neckham* writes, 'Italy & De Naclaims superior knowledge of civil law; but the study turra Re-\nof divinity and the liberal arts proves, that the university of Paris deserves the preference to all others. Agreeable also to Merlin's prophecy, Wiflom has flourished at the Ford of Oxen, and will in its due time pass over also into Ireland.\" But in the following Saxon age, when so many cities were destroyed, it underwent the common fate, and for a long while was famous only for the relics of Frideswide, who was ranked among the saints for her holy life, merely because she had solemnly devoted herself to God; and Prince Algar, soliciting her in marriage, was miraculously, as they say, deprived of his eye-sight.\"\n\nPerhaps the following additional extract from Camden will be more to the purpose in developing the ancient state of learning in this city, than any thing which we could bring forward of our own. \"When the storm of the Danish war was over, the most religious Prince Alfred* restored their retreats to the long-exiled mutes, by founding three colleges, one for grammarians, another for philosophy, and a third for divinity. This will be more fully explained by the following passage in the old annals of the New Monastery at Winchester. 'In the year of our Lord 806, the second year of the arrival of St Grimbald in England, the university of Oxford was begun; the first who presided and read divinity lectures in it being St Neoth, an abbot and able divine, and St Grimbald, a most eminent professor of the incomparable sweetness of the sacred pages; After the monk, an excellent scholar, professing grammar and rhetoric; John monk of the church of St David giving lectures in logic, music, and arithmetic; and John the monk, colleague of St Grimbald, a man of great parts, and a universal scholar, teaching geometry and astronomy before the most glorious and invincible King Alfred, whose memory will dwell like honey in the mouths of all.' Soon after, as we find in an excellent MS. of the said Affer, who was at that time professor here, 'broke out a sharp and fatal quarrel between Grymbold and those very learned men whom he had brought thither with him, and the old scholars whom he found there; who, on his coming, unanimously refused to receive the rules, methods, and forms of lecturing, that Grymbold introduced. Three years had passed without any great difference between them; but the secret aversion afterwards broke out with the utmost violence. In order to quell it, the invincible King Alfred, as soon as he heard of it by the messages and complaints from Grymbold, went in person to Oxford to put an end to the dispute, and he took the greatest pains to hear the causes and complaints on both sides. The foundation of the difference was this: The old scholars maintained, that before Grymbold came to Oxford, learning had flourished there, though the scholars at that time were fewer than in more ancient times, the greater part being driven out by the cruelty and oppression of the Pagans. They also proved and showed, and that by the undoubted testimony of ancient chronicles, that the ordinances and regulations of the place were established by certain religious and learned men, such as Gildas, Melkinmus, Ninimus, Kentigern, and others, who had all lived to a good old age in these studies, having settled matters there in peace and harmony; and also that St Germanus came to Oxford, and stayed there half a year in his journey over Britain to preach against the Pelagian heresies, and wonderfully approved their plan and institution. The king, with unheard-of condescension, gave both parties attentive hearing, and repeated his pious and reasonable advice to maintain mutual union and concord, and left them with the prospect that both parties would follow his advice and embrace his institutions. But Grymbold, offended at this proceeding, immediately retired to the monastery at Winchester lately founded by King Alfred. He also caused his tomb to be removed to Winchester, in which he had intended to lay his bones when his course of life was ended, in the vault under the chancel of St Peter's church at Oxford, which church himself had built from the ground, of stone polished in the most costly manner.'\n\n\"This happy restoration of learning was followed in a few years by various calamities. The Danes in the reign of Edward plundered and burnt the place; and soon after Harold Harefoot practised the most inhuman barbarities here in revenge for some of his men who were killed in an affray; so that the most melancholy remove of the students ensued, and the university remained almost extinct, a lamentable spectacle, till the time of William the Norman. Some have falsely supposed this prince took the city, misled by a wrong reading in some copies of Oxonia for Exonia. At that time, however, it was the seat of an university, as we learn from their words of Ingulphus, who lived at that time. 'I Ingulphus settled first at Westminster, was afterwards sent to study at Oxford, having made greater proficiency than many of my own age in Aristotle, &c.' What we call an university, they in that age called a study.\" Many are of opinion that it was deserted till about the year 1129, and that this defection was in consequence of its having been besieged and taken by William the Conqueror. About this year, however, Robert Pulen began to read lectures in divinity, or (as it is expressed in the chronicle of Ofeney abbey) the Holy Scriptures, which had fallen into neglect in England; and such was the resort of students to it, that in the reign of King John there were not fewer than 3000. Robert d'Oily, a Norman, to whom William the Conqueror had given the greatest part of it, built a castle on the west side in 1171; and he also supposed to have surrounded it with walls. In a palace built by Henry I. was born Richard I. commonly called Cœur de Lion. About the tenth of King John, there happened a quarrel between the citizens and students; in consequence of which many of the latter quitted it, but returned again a few years afterwards. Here Henry III. held a parliament to settle the differences betwixt him and his barons; when he confirmed the privileges granted to the university by his predecessors, and added others of his own. In this reign the students are said to have been 30,000, who were all excommunicated by the pope for some rudeness to his legate. In the time of Duns Scotus, we are told that 30,000 scholars attended his lectures. Matthew Paris styles the university of Oxford, 'the second school of the church after Paris, and the very foundation of the church.' The popes had before this honoured it with the title of University, which they had conferred by their decrees on no other but that of Paris, this of Oxford, and those of Bologna and Salamanca. It was decreed in the council of Vienne,\nOxford, enne, that 'schools for the study of the Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldee languages, should be erected in the studies of Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca (as the most considerable), that the knowledge of these languages might prevail by their being thus taught; and that Catholic persons be chosen, sufficiently versed therein, two in each language. For those in Oxford, the bishops, monasteries, chapters, convents, colleges, exempt and not exempt; and the rectors of churches throughout England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, were to provide a competent maintenance.' In Edw. III.'s time, the scholars were split into two factions, called the northern and southern men; a division which was attended with many disorders and much violence, but in a short time concord and harmony again prevailed.\n\nAs colleges began about this time to be founded and endowed, we shall here present our readers with a list of them, together with the time when, and the persons by whom, they were founded.\n\n| Colleges          | Founders                          | Kings reigns |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| University        | King Alfred                       | Alfred       |\n| Balliol           | Sir John Baliol, father to the king of Scots | Henry III    |\n| Merton            | Walter Merton, lord chancellor and bishop of Rochester | Edward I     |\n| Oriel             | Edward II                         | Edw.

The halls in which the students maintain themselves, except a few that have exhibitions, are these: St Edmund's, belonging to Queen's college; Magdalen, to Magdalen college; St Alban's, to Merton; St Mary's, to Oriel; New-Inn, to New-college. Several persons have been great benefactors to particular colleges, as Dr Ratcliffe to University college; Colonel Codrington and Dr Clarke, to All-Souls; Queen Caroline, to Queen's; the before-mentioned Dr Clarke and Mrs Eaton, to Worcester; Dr Wake, archbishop of Canterbury, to Christ-church. The most considerable of these colleges are Magdalen's and Christ-church, which are as noble foundations as any in the world. The church of the latter is the cathedral, and has a dean, eight canons, eight chaplains, eight singing men, eight choristers, a teacher of music, and an organist. Each of the colleges has its visitor appointed by its statutes, except Christ-church, which is subject to the visitation of the Sovereign alone.\n\nThe other remarkable buildings belonging to the university are, first, the public schools; secondly, the Bodleian or public library; thirdly, Ratcliffe's library, a most elegant structure, for building and furnishing which, Dr Ratcliffe left £40,000l.; fourthly, the theatre, built by Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury; fifthly, the museum, in which is an elaboratory and a repository for natural and artificial rarities and antiquities; sixthly, the Clarendon printing-house, so called, because it was built partly with the money arising to the university by the sale of Lord Clarendon's history. To the south of Magdalen college lies the physic garden, instituted by the Earl of Danby, and much improved by Dr Sherrard. It contains five acres, in which is a complete series of such plants as grow naturally, disposed in their respective classes; together with two neat and convenient greenhouses, stocked with a valuable collection of exotics, and a hot-house, where various plants brought from the warmer climates are raised. The whole body of the university, including professors, fellows, and students of all sorts, exceeds 3000. Each college has its particular statutes and rules for government. There are four terms in the year for public exercises, &c. and particular days and hours for public lectures by the several professors. The university is governed by a chancellor, high-treasurer, vice-chancellor, two proctors, a public orator (see Public Orator); a keeper of the archives, a registrar, three equire-beadles, and three yeomen-beadles. As to the city, it has had the same privileges granted to it as London, particularly an exemption from toll all over England. It was made an episcopal see in 1541, when Robert King, the last abbot of Oseney, was elected bishop. It is governed by a mayor, high-treasurer, recorder, four aldermen, eight assistants, two bailiffs, a town-clerk, two chamberlains, all that have borne the office of bailiff and chamberlain, and 24 common-council men; but these are subject to the chancellor or vice-chancellor of the university in all affairs of moment; and not only the mayor, but the principal citizens, and sheriff of the county, take an oath to maintain the privileges of the university. The city, including the colleges, is a place of considerable magnitude, having 13 parish-churches, besides the cathedral, well built, clean, and regular. At the entrance of the town from the Woodstock and Banbury roads, a neat hospital hath been lately erected by the trustees of Dr Ratcliffe's benefaction, out of the surplus money remaining after defraying the expense of his library. The male line of the family of Vere, to whom the city had given the title of earl for 500 years, failing in Aubrey de Vere, who was twentieth earl, Queen Anne conferred the title upon Robert Harley, a descendant of the Veres, in whose family it still continues. The chief trade of the city is in malt, conveyed in barges to London. It is impossible, in the narrow bounds necessarily preferred to this article, to give so particular an account of this celebrated place as its importance demands: but we shall refer our readers to the article University, when this seminary, amongst others, shall be more particularly described.\n\nOXFORDSHIRE, which made part of the territory\nOXYGEN, a term adopted in the new chemical nomenclature, to express the acidifying principle; from Oxyglyco εξος \"acid,\" and γενεῖν \"to generate.\" It is not found naturally in a separate state, but always combined.\n\nOXYGLYCU, a species of drink prepared of the sweetest honey-combs macerated and boiled. The combs, from which all the honey has been expressed, are put into a pot with pure water, and boiled till they seem to have deposited all their contained honey in the water. This liquor is to be kept; and, when diluted with cold water, is to be drank in the summer time, in order to remove thirst.\n\nOXYMEL, in Pharmacy, a composition of vinegar and honey.\n\nOYER, in law-books, seems to have been anciently used for what is now called affeer. See ASSISE.\n\nOYES, a corruption of the French OYLS, Hear ye; a term or formula frequently used by the criers in our courts on making proclamations, or to enjoin silence.\n\nOYSTER, a shell-fish. See OSTREA, CONCHOLOGY Index.\n\nOYSTER-Catcher. See HEMATOPUS, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nOYSTERS, Fossil. The largest bed that is known of fossil oysters is that near Riding in Berkshire. Their shape is entire, and they consist of the same substance with recent oyster-shells; and yet since the oldest histories that mention the place give an account of them, we must suppose they have lain there for a long time. They extend over no less than six acres of ground; and just above them is a large stratum of a greenish loam, which some writers call a green earth, and others a green sand. It is composed of a crumbling marle, and philet; a large portion of sand. Under them is a thick stratum of chalk. They all lie in a level bed; and the strata above the shells are natural, and appear never to have been dug through till the time of finding the shells.\n\nOZANA, a foul and malignant ulcer of the nose, distinguished by its odor, and often accompanied with a caries of the bones of the nose.\n\nOZANAM, James, an eminent French mathematician, born at Bollignieux in Bretagne, in 1642, of a wealthy family. His father gave him a good education, and designed him for the church; but some mathematical books falling into his hands, inspired him with a love for that science; and though he had no master to instruct him, he made such progress in it, that, at fifteen years of age, he wrote a piece in mathematics, which he thought proper to insert in the works he afterwards published. He at length taught that science at Lyons; and his mathematical lessons brought him in a considerable revenue, till the year 1701: at which period, a war breaking out on the succession to the crown of Spain, he lost almost all his scholars, and was reduced to a very melancholy situation; and his wife dying the same year, he was so afflicted, that he never perfectly recovered it. In 1702 he was admitted into the Royal Academy of Sciences; and died of an apoplexy in 1717.—He was of a mild and serene\nrene temper, of singular generosity, and of a cheerful disposition.—He would not allow himself to know more of religion than the common people. He used to say, that \"it was the business of the doctors of the orbeone to dispute, of the pope to decide, and of a mathematician to go to heaven in a perpendicular line.\" His works are very numerous, and have met with the approbation of the learned. The principal are, 1. Practical Geometry, 12mo. 2. A mathematical dictionary. 3. A course of mathematics, 5 vols. 8vo. 4. Mathematical and philosophical recreations, the most complete edition of which is that which was improved by Montucla, and afterwards enlarged by Dr Charles Hutton, published in 1823, in four vols. 8vo. 5. An easy method of surveying. 6. New elements of algebra, a work much commended by Monsr. Leibnitz. 7. Theoretical and practical perspective, &c.\n\nOZELL, John, a well-known translator, educated in Christ's Hospital, was possessed of a competent fortune, and always enjoyed good places, being auditor-general of the city and bridge accounts, of St Paul's cathedral and of St Thomas's hospital. Notwithstanding his attention to business, he still retained a love for polite literature; and though he did not appear as an original author, yet having made himself master of most of the living languages, he favoured the world with many translations from them, as well as from the Latin and Greek; which, if they are not the most elegant, are generally faithful and true to the originals. He died in the year 1743.\n\nOZIAS, in sacred history, the son of Micha, of the tribe of Simeon, one of the governors of Bethulia when it was besieged by Holofernes. He vigorously supported the siege against this general, and received Achior into his house, when he had been driven from the Assyrian camp. Finding however at length that the city was reduced to great necessity for water, and that the people mutinied against him, he promised to surrender the place in five days, if in that time God did not send them relief. Judith (vi. vii. viii. ix. and x.) being informed of this resolution, sent to speak with Ozias and the other leading men of the city; made a prudent remonstrance upon their seeming to preferre a time to the Lord, in which he must succour them; encouraged them to patience; and without discovering her design, told them that she would go out in the night. Ozias being at the gate of the city when Judith departed, opened it to her, and waited in the city for the success of her undertaking, praying with her people to God that he would be pleased to deliver them. See the article Judith.\n\nOZOLÆ, or OZOLI, a people who inhabited the eastern parts of Aetolia which were called Oxolea. This tract of territory lay at the north of the bay of Corinth, and extended about 12 miles. They received their name from the bad stench (εξη) of their bodies and clothes, which were the raw hides of wild beasts. Some derive it from the stench of the flagellated water in the neighbouring lakes and marshes. According to a fabulous tradition, they received their name from a very different circumstance: During the reign of a son of Deucalion, a bitch brought into the world a stick instead of whelps. The stick was planted into the ground by the king, and it grew up to a large vine, and produced grapes, from which the inhabitants of the country were called Ozolæ, not from εξη, \"to smell bad,\" but from εξης, \"a branch or sprout.\" The name Oxolea, on account of its indelicate signification, was highly disagreeable to the inhabitants; they therefore exchanged it soon for that of Aetolians.\n\nP, the 15th letter and 11th consonant of the alphabet; the sound of which is formed by expressing the breath somewhat more suddenly than in forming the sound of b; in other respects these two sounds are pretty much alike, and are often confounded one with another. When p stands before t or s, its sound is lost; as in the words palms, psychology, pontifical, pitfall, &c. When placed before h, they both together have the sound f; as in philosophy, physics, &c.\n\nP and B are so like each other, that Quintilian declares, that in the word obtinuit, his reason required him to put a b, but that his ears could hear nothing but a p, optimus: hence in ancient inscriptions, and old glossaries, it appears that these two letters have often been confounded. Several nations still pronounce one for the other, the Welch and Germans particularly.\n\nAs an abbreviation, P stands for Publius, Pondo, &c. PA. D.I.G., for Patria Dignitas; P. C. for Patres Conscripsit; P. F. for Publii Filius; P. P. for Propositum, or Propositum publice; P. R. for Populus Romanus; P. R. S. for Praetoris Sententia, P. R. S. P. for Praefectus provinciae.\n\nP. M. among Astronomers, is frequently used for post meridiem, or \"afternoon;\" and sometimes for post mane, \"after the morning, i.e. after midnight.\" P was also used among the ancients as a numeral letter, signifying the same with the G, viz. a hundred; according to the verse of Ugutio,\n\n41\nPAC\n\nP. similem cum G numerum monstratur habere.\n\nThough Baronius thinks it rather stood for seven.\n\nWhen a dash was added atop of P, it stood for four hundred thousand.\n\nSt Jerome observes on Daniel, that the Hebrews had no P; but that the ph served them instead thereof; adding that there is but one word in the whole Bible read with a P, viz. apadno. The Greek π signified 80. On the French coins, P denotes those that were struck at Dijon.\n\nIn the Italian music, P stands for piano, or \"softly:\" and P. P. P. for pianissimo, or \"very softly.\"\n\nAmong physicians, P stands for pulg, or the eighth part of an handful; P. A. partes aequales, or equal parts of the ingredients; P. P. signifies pulvis patrum, or Jesuit's bark in powder; and ppu. preparatus or prepared.\n\nPABULUM, among natural philosophers, the same with FUEL.\n\nPACA, see Mus, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nPACE, a measure taken from the space between the two feet of a man in walking; usually reckoned two feet and a half; and in some men a yard or three feet. The geometrical pace is five feet; and 60,000 such paces make one degree on the equator.\n\nPACE, in the manege, is of three kinds, viz. walk, trot, and gallop; to which may be added an amble, because some horses have it naturally.\n\nHorses which go shuffling, or with mixed paces between the walk and amble, are for the most part of no value; which commonly proceeds from their fiery temper, but sometimes from a weakness in their reins or legs.\n\nPACHAMAC, a valley of Peru, in South America, ten miles south of Lima; celebrated for its pleasantness and fertility, but more on account of a magnificent temple built by the Incas of Peru, to the honour of their god. When the Spaniards conquered Peru, they found immense riches therein.\n\nPACHSU, a small island in the Mediterranean sea; near the coast of Epirus, and in European Turkey. It lies south of Corfu, and is subject to Venice.\n\nPACIFIC OCEAN, that vast ocean which separates Asia from America. It is called Pacific, from the moderate weather the first mariners who sailed in it met with between the tropics; and it was called South Sea, because the Spaniards crossed the isthmus of Darien from north to south when they first discovered it; though it is properly the Western ocean with regard to America.\n\nGeographers call the South sea Mare Pacificum, \"the Pacific ocean,\" as being less infested with storms than the Atlantic; but M. Frezier affirms it does not deserve that appellation, and that he has seen as violent storms therein as in any other sea; but Magellan happening to have a very favourable wind, and not meeting with anything to ruffle him when he first traversed this vast ocean in 1520, gave it the name which it has retained ever since. Maty, however, adds, that the wind is so regular there, that the vessels would frequently go from Acapulco to the Philippine islands without shifting a sail.\n\nPACK, in commerce, denotes a quantity of goods made up in loads or bales for carriage. A pack of wool is 17 stone and 2 pounds, or a horse's load.\n\nPACKAGE, is a small duty of one penny in the pound, paid for all goods not particularly rated.\n\nPACKET, or PACKET BOAT, a vessel appointed by the government to carry the mail of letters, packets, and expresses from one kingdom to another by sea in the most expeditious manner. Thus, the packet-boats, under the direction of the post-master-general of Great Britain, carry the mails from Dover to Calais, from Falmouth to Lisbon, from Harwich to Helvoetshuis, and from Parkgate to Dublin. See POST.\n\nPACOS, or PACO, in Zoology, a species of camel, commonly, though improperly, reckoned a species of sheep; and known among many by the name of the Indian sheep, or Peruvian sheep. See CAMELUS, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nThis creature has been accounted a sheep, because its hair is so long as to resemble wool, and it is prodigiously thick, its head and neck alone having more wool on them than the whole body of our largest sheep. Its body is clothed in the same proportion with a woolly hair equally fine.\n\nPACTOLUS, in Ancient Geography, a river of Lydia, called Chrytorrhoas, from its rolling down golden sand, according to Herodotus, Plutarch, Pliny, and Strabo; rising in Mount Tmolus (Strabo). From this river Croesus is thought to have had all his riches. In Strabo's time it ceased to roll down any. It ran through Sardis; after which it fell into the Hermus, and both together into the Aegean sea at Phocaea in Ionia. A river celebrated by Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, Lycophron, Horace, Apollonius.\n\nPACUVIUS, MARCUS, of Brundufium in Calabria, a tragic poet in high reputation about the year of Rome 600. He was nephew of Ennius; published several theatrical pieces, though we have only some fragments of his poetry remaining; and died at Tarentum at above 90 years of age.\n\nPADAN-ARAM (Bible), literally the plains of Aram, or Syria; translated by the Seventy simply Mesopotamia, or Mesopotamia of Syria; by the Vulgate, Syrie; the Syrians on this and on the other side of the Euphrates, not differing remarkably from each other in language and manners, as Josephus allows.\n\nPADDOC, or PADDOC-COURSE, a piece of ground encompassed with pales or a wall, and taken out of a park, for exhibiting races with greyhounds, for plates, wagers, or the like.\n\nA paddock is generally a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad: at the one end is a little house where the dogs are to be entered, and whence they are flipped; near which are pens to inclose two or three deer for the sport. Along the course are several pofts, viz. the low poft, which is 160 yards from the dog-house and pens; the quarter of a mile poft, half-mile poft, and pinching poft; besides the ditch, which is a place made to receive the deer, and preserve them from farther pursuit. And near this place are seats for the judges chosen to decide the wager.\n\nThe keepers, in order to flip the dogs fairly, put a falling collar upon each, flipped round a ring; and the deer being turned loose, and put forward by a teaser,\nPAD\n\nPadborn as soon as he is arrived at the low post, the dog-house door is thrown open, and the dogs flipped. If now the deer swerve so much, as that his head is judged nearer the dog-house than the ditch before he arrive at the pinching-post, it is no match, and must be run over again three days after: but if the deer runs straight beyond the pinching-post, then that dog which is nearest when he swerves, or is blanched by any accident, wins the match; but if no such swerve happens, then the match is won by the dog who first leaps the ditch.\n\nPADERBORN, a duchy of Germany in the circle of Westphalia, has the county of Lippe on the north and west; Hesse-Cassel and Waldeck, on the south; and Münster, with the duchy of Westphalia on the west. Its greatest length from east to west is about 40 miles, and its breadth where widest 30. Some parts of it yield good pasture, and breed abundance of cattle; but it is not very fruitful in corn. There is a heath called the Senne or Sendel, of great extent, but very barren and desolate. There are, however, good iron mines in the country, with salt and medicinal springs, plenty of deer and other game; and it is watered with several rivers abounding with fish, as the Wefer, the Dimer, the Biber, the Nette, the great Emmer, the Lippe, the Alme, and the Pader. It contains 54 parishes, in which are 25 market towns and 16 monasteries. The Roman Catholic is the predominant religion of the country, yet there are also many Protestants in it. The bishopric was erected by Charlemagne, towards the close of the eighth century, and the cathedral was consecrated by Pope Leo in person, anno 796. The bishop is sovereign of the country, a prince of the empire, and suffragan of the archbishop of Mentz. His revenue is about 30,000 pounds a year, and he is able to raise 3000 men. In the matricula his assessment is 18 horse and 34 foot, or 352 florins monthly in lieu of them. Towards the charges of the sovereign courts of the empire, he pays for each term 162 rix-dollars and 29 kruitzers. The chapter consists of 24 capitular canons, who must prove their noble extraction by four decents. The arms of the bishopric are a cross or, in a field gules. For the government of it, and the administration of justice, there are several councils and colleges under the bishop. Here are also a hereditary marshal, fewer, cup-bearer, chamberlain, steward, and purveyor. It was in this bishopric that Quintilius Varus, with the Roman army under his command, was routed by the Germans under Arminius.\n\nPADERBORN, the capital of the above bishopric. It stands 40 miles north-west of Cassel, 50 south-east of Münster, and 60 south-west of Hanover; being a large, populous, well-built, and well fortified city. Its name is compounded of pader, a rivulet, which rises just under the high altar of the cathedral, and born, i.e. a spring. It was one of the Hanse-towns; and, till 1624, an imperial city. The cathedral is a grand fabric, inferior to few in the empire. There is a gold crucifix in it of 60 pounds weight, presented by Otho II. The university, of which the Jesuits have the direction, was founded in 1597, and the walls were built in the beginning of the 11th century. In 1530 an attempt was made to introduce Lutheranism; but 16 of the principal citizens who had embraced it were executed, and the rest obliged to abjure it. Duke Christian of Brunswick carried off from hence, in 1692, the silver images of the twelve apostles, and the silver coffin of St Lotharius; and had them coined into money, with this inscription, God's Friend, the Priest's Enemy. The trade of this town, though formerly great, is now inconsiderable; and the inhabitants subsist mostly by agriculture and breeding of cattle. Though the bishop has a palace in the city, he resides (when he vouchsafes to visit this country, which is seldom, having other and more valuable benefices) at Neuhaus, seven miles off, where he has a magnificent castle. Charlemagne and other emperors sometimes resided here, and held diets of the empire.\n\nPADOGI, a punishment used in Russia. The body of the criminal is stripped to the waist, and then laid upon the ground; one slave holds the head of the person to be punished between his knees, and another the lower part of the body; then rods are applied to the back till some person gives notice to desist, by crying out, enough. This punishment is considered in Russia merely as a correction of the police, exercised on the soldier by military discipline, by the nobility on their servants, and by persons in authority over all such as are under their command. After the accession of Elizabeth to the throne of Russia, the punishments were reduced to two kinds, viz. the padogi and Knout.\n\nPADUA, an ancient, large, and celebrated city of Italy, with a university and a bishop's see. It is also capital of the Paduanos; but is much less considerable than it was formerly: for it now contains no more than 30,000 inhabitants, whereas it formerly had 100,000, and many of the houses are gone to ruin: however, the hall where justice is administered is a superb structure. The cathedral church, and the college of the university, are in that part called the Old Town; and there are piazzas under all the houses, where persons may walk without being exposed to the weather. The garden of the university is curious, on account of the number of plants. Here a student may take his degrees, let him be of what sect of Christianity he will; nay, though he should be a Jew or a Turk. The patron of this city is St Anthony, who lies in the cathedral; they have such a veneration for him, that the beggars do not ask charity in the name of God, but for the love of St Anthony. The Jews live in a distinct part of the city; and the neighbouring mountains produce excellent wine and oil, with delicious fruit. It was taken by the Venetians in 1706. It is seated on the rivers Brenta and Bacchiglione, in a fine plain, and is about seven miles in circumference. E. Long. 11. 55. N. Lat. 45. 24.\n\nPADUANO, among medals, a modern medal struck in imitation of the antique, or a new medal struck with all the marks and characters of antiquity. This name is properly applicable to those medals only that were struck in the seventh century by an Italian painter born at Padua; who succeeded so well in the imposture, that the best judges are at a loss to distinguish his medals from the genuine ones. Though it is frequently used in general for all medals of this kind.\n\nPADUANO, a small province of Italy, in the territory of Venice, bounded on the east by the Dogado, on the south by the Polefino di Rovigo, on the west by the Veronese, and on the north by the Vicentino. Its soil is well watered; and is one of the most fertile in Italy. The province is about 40 miles in length, and 35 in breadth. Padua is the capital town.\nPADUS, anciently called Eridanus, especially by the Greeks; a river famous for the fable of Phaeton (Ovid). It rises in Mount Velinus, in the Alpes Cottiae, from three springs, dividing the Cisalpine Gaul into the Transpadana and Cispadana, (Strabo); and swelled by other rivers falling into it on each side from the Alps and Apennines, it discharges itself with a course from west to east, at seven mouths, into the Adriatic (Mela). The lake through which it discharges itself into the sea, is called by the natives the Seven Seas. Now the Po.\n\nPADUS, a species of cherry. See PRUNUS, Botany Index.\n\nPÆAN, among the ancient pagans, was a song of rejoicing sung in honour of Apollo, chiefly used on occasions of victory and triumph. See APOLLO.\n\nPÆAN, in the ancient poetry, a foot consisting of four syllables; of which there are four kinds, the paean primus, fecundus, &c.\n\nThe paean primus consists of one long syllable and three short ones, or a trocheus and pyrrhichius, as temporious; the paean fecundus consists of a short syllable, a long, and two short, or an iambus and a pyrrhichius, as potentiæ; the paean tertius consists of two short syllables, a long and a short one, or a pyrrhichius and a trocheus, as animatus; the paean quartus consists of three short syllables and a long one, or a pyrrhichius and iambus, as celebritas.\n\nPÆDEROSA, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 36th order, Coniferae. See Botany Index.\n\nPÆDO BAPTISM: infant baptism, or that conferred on children; from παιδος, infant, and βαπτισμος, baptism. This has been the subject of great controversy in the church. See Anabaptists, Batists, &c.\n\nPÆONIA, Piony, a genus of plants belonging to the polyandria clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 26th order, Multiflorae. See Botany Index.\n\nPÆSTUM, called Posidonia by the Greeks, a town of Lucania, on the Sinus Petrinus; an ancient colony prior to the first Punic war, according to Livy; but later, according to Velleius. Pæstane rose were in great esteem, and produced twice a-year (Virgil, Ovid).\n\nPAGAN, Blaise François Comte de, an eminent French mathematician, was born at Avignon in Provence, March 3, 1624; and took to the profession of a soldier at fourteen, having been bred to it with the greatest care. In 1629 he was engaged at the siege of Caen, in the battle of Pont de Ce, and the reduction of the Navarens, and the rest of Bearn; where he signalized himself, and acquired a reputation far surpassing his years. He was present, in 1621, at the siege of St John d'Angeli, as also that of Clarac and Montauban, where he lost his left eye by a musket-shot. At this siege he had another loss, which equally afflicted him, viz. that of the constable of Luynes, who died there of a scarlet fever. The constable was a near relation, and had been his patron at court. He did not, however, sink under the misfortune, but on the contrary took fresh spirits from the necessity he was now in of trifling solely to himself. Accordingly there happened after this time neither siege, battle, nor any other occasion, in which he did not signalize himself by some effort of courage and conduct. At the passage of the Alps, and the barricade of Suza, he put himself at the head of the forlorn hope, consisting of the bravest youths among the guards; and undertook to arrive the first at the attack, by a private way which was extremely dangerous; when, having gained the top of a very steep mountain, he cried out to his followers, \"See the way to glory!\" He flung along this mountain; and, his companions following him, they came first to the attack, as they wished to do. They immediately began a furious assault; and, the army coming to assist, they forced the barricades. He had afterwards the pleasure of standing on the left hand of the king, when his majesty related this heroic action to the duke of Savoy with the deserved commendations, in the presence of a very full court. When the king laid siege to Nancy in 1633, our hero had the honour to attend his sovereign, in drawing the lines and forts of circumvallation. In 1642 his majesty sent him to the service in Portugal, in the post of field marshal. In this same year he unfortunately lost his eye fight by a discharger. But though he was thus disabled from serving his country with his conduct and courage, he reaffirmed, with greater vigour than ever, the study of the mathematics and fortification; and, in 1645, gave the public a treatise on this latter subject. It was allowed by all who understood the science, that nothing had then appeared that was preferable to it; and, indeed, whatever improvements have been made since, they have perhaps been derived chiefly from this treatise, as conclusions from their principles. In 1651 he published his Geometrical Theorems, which show a perfect knowledge of all the parts of the mathematics. In 1655 he printed A Paraphrase, in French, of the Account, in Spanish, of the River of the Amazons, by Father de Rennes, a Jesuit; and we are assured, that, though blind, he drew the chart of that river and the parts adjacent which is seen in this work. In 1657 he published The Theory of the Planets, cleared from that multiplicity of eccentric circles and epicycles, which the astronomers had invented to explain their motions. This work distinguished him among astronomers as much as that of fortifications did among engineers; and he printed, in 1658, his Astronomical Tables, which are very succinct and plain. Few great men are without some foible: Pagan's was that of a prejudice in favour of judicial astrology; and though he is more revered than most others, yet we cannot put what he did on that subject among those productions which do honour to his understanding. He was beloved and respected by all persons illustrious for rank as well as science; and his house was the rendezvous of all the polite, and worthy both in city and court. He died at Paris, Nov. 18, 1665; and was never married. The king ordered his first physician to attend him in his illness, and gave several marks of the extraordinary esteem which he had for his merit.\n\nHe had an universal genius; and, having turned himself entirely to the art of war, and particularly to the branch of fortification, he made extraordinary progress in it. He understood mathematics not only better than is usual for a gentleman whose view is to push his fortune in the army, but even to a degree of perfection superior to that of the ordinary masters who teach that science. He had particular genius for this kind of learning, that he obtained it more readily by meditation than\nthan by reading authors upon it; and accordingly spent less time in such books than he did in those of history and geography. He had also made morality and politics his particular study; so that he may be said to have drawn his own character in his Homme Heroique, and to have been one of the completest gentlemen of his time. Louis XIII. was heard to say several times, that the count de Pagan was one of the most worthy, best turned, most adroit, and most valiant men, in his kingdom.—That branch of his family, which removed from Naples to France in 1552, became extinct in his person.\n\nPAGAN, a heathen, gentile, or idolater; one who adores false gods. See Mythology.\n\nPAGANALIA, certain festivals observed by the ancient Romans in the month of January. They were instituted by Servius Tullius, who appointed a certain number of villages (pagi), in each of which an altar was to be raised for annual sacrifices to their tutelar gods; at which all the inhabitants were to assist, and give presents in money, according to their sex and age, by which means the number of country-people was known. The servants upon this occasion offered cakes to Ceres and Tellus, to obtain plentiful harvests.\n\nPAGANELLUS, a species of fish. See Gobius, Ichthyology Index.\n\nPAGANISM, the religious worship and discipline of pagans; or, the adoration of idols and false gods. See Idolatry, Mythology, and Polytheism.\n\nPAGEANT, a triumphal car, chariot, arch, or other like pompous decoration, variously adorned with colours, flags, &c., carried about in public shows, processions, &c.\n\nPAGI, ANTONY, a very famous Cordelier, and one of the ablest critics of his time, was born at Rogné in Provence in 1624. He took the habit in the convent at Arles in 1641, and was at length four times provincial of his order; but his religious duties did not prevent his vigorous application to the study of chronology and ecclesiastical history, in which he excelled. His most considerable work is, A Critique upon the Annals of Baronius; where, following the learned cardinal year by year, he has rectified an infinite number of mistakes both in chronology and in the representation of facts. He published the first volume in 1689, dedicated to the clergy of France, who allowed him a pension: the whole was printed after his death, in 4 vols folio, at Geneva, in 1705, by the care of his nephew Francis Pagl, of the same order. He wrote some other things before his death, which happened in 1699; and had the character of an able historian as well as of a learned and candid critic. His nephew Francis, above mentioned, wrote A Chronological Abridgement of the History of the Popes, in Latin, 3 vols 4to. Francis had also a nephew, Anthony Pagl, who added three more volumes to the History of the Popes; of which two more were intended, if not executed.\n\nPAGNINUS, SANCTUS, an Italian Dominican, eminent for his skill in oriental languages and biblical learning, was born at Lucca in 1466, and became afterwards an ecclesiastic of the order of St Dominic. He was Pagninus, deeply and accurately skilled in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Arabic; but he was particularly excellent in the Hebrew. He applied himself to examine the vulgar translation of the Scriptures; and believing it to be either not of Jerome, or greatly corrupted, he undertook to make a new one from the prefect Hebrew text; in which he meant to imitate St Jerome, who set about making a new translation at a time when the church would admit no other but the Septuagint. This design of Pagninus, so early after the restoration of letters, seemed a bold one; yet such was the reputation of the man, that it was approved by Pope Leo X. who promised to furnish him with all necessary expenses for carrying on the work; and, besides, we find at the beginning of this translation, which was printed at Lyons in 1527, two letters of the succeeding popes, Hadrian VI. and Clement VII. which licensed the printing of it. Pagninus, in his Letters to Pope Clement, for the printing of this translation, openly declares, that the Vulgar edition, as it is at present, is not St Jerome's; yet adds, that he has retained in his translation as much of it as he could. It appears by a letter of Pius Miradula to Pagninus, that he had spent 25 years upon this translation. It is the first modern translation of the Bible from the Hebrew text; and the Jews who read it affirmed, that it agreed exactly with the Hebrew, and was in some respects superior to the ancient translations. The great fault of Pagninus was, that he adhered with too great servility to the original text; and this scrupulous attachment made his translation, says Father Simon, \"obscure, barbarous, and full of solecisms.\" He imagined, that to make a faithful translation of the Scripture, it was necessary to follow exactly the letter according to the strictest of grammar. This, however, is quite contrary to his pretended exactness, because two languages seldom agree in their ways of speaking; and therefore, instead of expressing the original in its proper purity, he defaces and robs it of all its ornaments.\" Father Simon nevertheless allows the great abilities and learning of Pagninus; and all the later commentators and translators of the Scriptures have agreed in giving him his just praise. Huetius, though he thinks Father Simon's criticism of him just and well grounded, yet proposes his manner as a model for all translators of the sacred books: Scriptura interpretandae rationis utile nobis exemplar propopulsi Sanctus Pagninus. He also translated the New Testament from the Greek, as he had done the Old from the Hebrew, laying the Vulgar all the while before him; and dedicated it to Pope Clement VII. He was author of a Hebrew Lexicon, and a Hebrew Grammar; which Buxtorf, who calls him vir linguarum Orientium peritissimus, made great use of in compiling his. He died in 1536, aged 70. Luther spoke of him and his translations in terms of the highest applause.\n\nPAGO, an island in the gulf of Venice, separated from the continent of Morlachia by a narrow channel. The ancient geographers have left us no description of it; though (as For's observes) its form (A), extent, and rich produce, unquestionably deserved it.\" And this\n\n(a) Its figure is indeed remarkably irregular, its breadth being in no proportion to its length; for one of the extremities, called Punta di Loni, is above ten miles long, and less than one broad. Almost all the circumference is\nthis is the more unaccountable, as we know the Romans were well acquainted with it; and on the other islands adjoining to it are many vestiges of buildings, inscriptions, tiles, and hewn stones, all sure signs of Roman habitations. Its ancient name was in all probability Portunata. \"This island (says Mr Fortis*) is extended from north to south over against maritime Croatia, or the mountain Morlaccia. It is about 50 miles long; its breadth is unequal. One particular circumstance distinguishes it from all the other islands of the Adriatic, and is a large internal salt-water lake 15 miles long from south to north, into which the sea enters by a canal not above a quarter of a mile broad in some places. This lake is frequented by the tunny fish, which, when once in, cannot return again to the sea. There are also two smaller lakes on the island; one near Vlafisch, abounding in fish, particularly eels; and one near the hamlet of Slabine.\n\n\"In this island the winter is dreadfully cold, and the summer scorchingly hot. Those who have been there in the winter time speak of it as a Siberia quite covered with snow and ice, and always exposed to the cold north wind; I, who was there in the hot season, thought it equal to the most scorching parts of the world. The naked rocks, which not only form the organization, but also the superficies of almost all the island; the narrowness of the valleys; the reverberation of the water of the lake, generally quite calm in summer; multiply the heat so prodigiously among those stones, that the vines, which are planted all round the lake, ripen their grapes by the beginning of August; and the other products that grow there anticipate the usual time of maturity in the same manner. The meteors are exceedingly irregular in the summer time; sudden whirlwinds are frequent, and heavy showers of rain: the last are hurtful to the inhabitants of one part of the island, and are favourable to the cultivation of the opposite end.\n\n\"They cultivate neither corn nor oil on this island; but it produces plenty of wine, and an immense quantity of salt. The other products are wool, honey, and a little salt fish. The quantity of wine amounts annually, on a medium, to 40,000 Venetian barrels; and from the husks, they distil 2000 barrels of rakia or brandy. The salt, in 1663, amounted to 800,000 Venetian ducats. The salt-works are well contrived and well kept: they extend along a shallow pool, which forms the eastern extremity of the lake within for four miles in length and about half a mile in breadth. On the sides of this fen the best part of the vines lie; but the upper part of the hills on each side is altogether naked and barren; there is not even a sufficiency of fire-wood, and the inhabitants are obliged to provide themselves elsewhere. The soil at the foot of the hills, where the vines are planted, is full of gravel and small stones: and hence the wine is of good quality. The air is not unhealthy, notwithstanding the vicinity of the salt pits; but the frequent high winds carry off the noxious exhalations. The most considerable product of the island is the salt. The greatest part of the people of Pago live by working in the salt pits, and have a comfortable subsistence regularly paid by the government: it is therefore a very important circumstance for the inhabitants of the city to have a dry summer; and hence the ignorant vulgar look upon rain as a mischief brought upon the country by the force of witchcraft. In consequence of this idea, they elect a friar to exorcise the meteors, and keep the rain off the island. If, notwithstanding the poor friar's endeavours, the summer happens to be rainy, he loses his reputation and his bread; but if two or three dry seasons follow successively, he meets with great reverence and advantage. Part of the salt works belongs to the government, and the rest to private proprietors; they are meliorated every year; and for that end the public lends money to those proprietors who want it, and who without that assistance could not make the requisite improvements.\n\n\"Many vestiges of ancient habitations still remain on the island of Pago, as well as of walled places, which either have been destroyed by the incursions of enemies or by time. Historians say that the island was often abandoned by its inhabitants; and indeed it is rather to be wondered at how men ever could resolve to settle in so wretched a country. The small number of inhabitants, after so many years of peace and tranquillity under the Venetian government, evidently proves how little the island is really habitable. The town of Pago was built by the Venetians about 300 years ago; and contains upwards of 2000 inhabitants, and all the rest of the island scarcely 900. The difficulty of access to the city of Pago, and the ill accommodation that strangers meet with, make it very little frequented. Hence the inhabitants are as wild and unpolished as if they lay at the greatest distance from the sea and the commerce of polite people. The gentry, who pretend to show their manners different from those of the vulgar, are truly grotesque figures, both in their dress, behaviour, and insolent pretensions. The ignorance of their clergy is incredible; a priest of the greatest consequence there, and who was thought a man of learning, did not know how Pago was called in Latin. There are two convents of friars in Pago and one of nuns; and several churches, all in very bad order, and ill served. At Terra Vecchia also there is a convent of Franciscan monks; a race of men who, under various names and disguises, infest every place where credulous ignorance can be persuaded to maintain the idle and superstitious. One superstitious custom,\n\nis dismal, without trees or any kind of visible plants or grass, steep, craggy, and uninhabited. On entering the lake through the channel that communicates with the sea, nothing is to be seen either on the right or left but bare hanging rocks, so disfigured on the outside by the violent percussion of the waves, that the stratification is hardly distinguishable. In general, the stone of the island is of the same kind as the Istrian, or breccia; and, besides, there are large strata of blue and yellowish sandstone. The channel, or inward bay of Pago, is not a harbour; on the contrary, it is a very dangerous station, and even inaccessible in winter, when the north wind blows with such fury, that the inhabitants of the town dare not stir out of their houses, and much less the few that are scattered over the country. The sky appears always cloudy in that season, by the thick mist that arises from the repercussion of the waves on that long chain of rough and hollow rocks.\ncustom, amongst a variety of others, exists among their women, and particularly among those who have been married but a short time; if their husband happens to die, they tear their hair out in great earnest, and scatter it on the coffin; and this ceremony is so much consecrated by custom, that no woman, even though she had vehemently hated her husband, would fail in performing it.\"\n\nPAGOD, or PAGODA, a name given by the East Indians to the temples where they worship their gods. We shall not in this place enter into a full detail of the several pagodas of different nations, and their peculiar circumstances. These matters seem to come in more properly under the religion, or, as others will call it, the superstition, of the people to whom they belong. We shall therefore content ourselves in the present article with an account of a paper in the Asiatic Researches, concerning the sculptures, &c. at Mavalipuram, a few miles north of Sadras, and known to seamen by the name of the seven pagodas.\n\nThe monuments which Mr Chambers (who communicated the paper) describes, appear, he says, to be the ruins of some great city decayed many centuries ago. \"They are situated close to the sea, between Covelong and Sadras, somewhat remote from the high road that leads to the different European settlements. And when visited in 1776, there was still a native village adjoining to them which retained the ancient name, and in which a number of brahmins resided that seemed perfectly well acquainted with the subjects of most of the sculptures to be seen there.—The rock, or rather hill of stone, on which great part of these works are executed, is one of the principal marks for mariners as they approach the coast, and to them the place is known by the name of the Seven Pagodas, possibly because the summits of the rock have prevented them with that idea as they passed: but it must be confessed that no aspect which the hill assumes as viewed on the shore, seems at all to authorize this notion; and there are circumstances, which will be mentioned in the sequel, that would lead one to suspect that this name has arisen from some such number of pagodas that formerly stood here, and in time have been buried in the waves.\" The rock here mentioned, as it rises abruptly out of a level plain of great extent, naturally engrosses the attention of the eye. It consists chiefly of a single stone; and in its shape (which is singular and romantic), in a distant view, it has the appearance of an antique and lofty edifice. Works of imagery and sculpture crowd thicker upon the eye on a nearer approach, and at first sight at least favours the idea of a petrified town, which, through the credulity of travellers*, has been supposed to exist in various parts of the world. \"Proceeding on by the foot of the hill on the side facing the sea, there is a pagoda rising out of the ground, of one solid stone, about 16 or 18 feet high, which seems to have been cut upon the spot out of a detached rock that has been found of a proper size for that purpose. The top is arched, and the style of architecture according to which it is formed, different from any now used in those parts.\" Beyond this a numerous group of human figures in bas relief, considerably larger than life, attract attention. They represent considerable persons, and their exploits, many of which are now very indistinct through the injuries of time, affixed by the corroding nature of the sea air; others, while protected from that element, are as fresh as when recently finished.\n\nThe hill, which is at first of easy ascent, \"is in other parts rendered more so, by very excellent steps cut out in several places, where the communication would be difficult or impracticable without them. A winding stair of this sort leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures of idols in high relief upon its walls, very well finished and perfectly fresh, as it faces the west, and is therefore sheltered from the sea air.\" This temple our author conjectures to have been a place of worship appertaining to a palace; some remains of which still exist, and to which there is a passage from the temple by another flight of steps. This conjecture (for it is brought forward as merely such) is in some measure favoured by several ruins still remaining, and by the tradition of the brahmins who inhabit the place. This finishes the objects \"on that part of the upper surface of the hill, the ascent to which is on the north; but on descending from thence, you are led round the hill to the opposite side, in which there are steps cut from the bottom to a place near the summit, where is an excavation that seems to have been intended for a place of worship, and contains various sculptures of Hindoo deities. The most remarkable of these is a gigantic figure of Vishnu (A), asleep on a kind of bed, with a huge snake wound about in many coils by way of pillow for his head; and these figures, according to the manner of this place, are all of one piece hewn from the body of the rock.\" These works, however, although they are unquestionably stupendous, are, in our author's opinion, surpassed by others about a mile and a half to the southward of the hill. \"They consist of two pagodas of about 30 feet long by 20 feet wide, and about as many in height, cut out of the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone. Near these also stand an elephant full as big as life, and a lion much larger than the natural size, but very well executed, each hewn also out of one stone. None of the pieces that have fallen off in cutting these extraordinary sculptures are now to be found near or anywhere in the neighbourhood of them, so that there is no means of ascertaining the degree of labour and time that has been spent upon them, nor the size of the rock or rocks from which they have been hewn; a circumstance which renders their appearance the more striking and singular. And though their situation is very near the sea beach, they have not suffered at all by the corrosive air of that element, which has provided them with a defence against itself, by throwing up before them a high bank that completely shelters them. There is also a great symmetry in their form, though that of the pagodas is different from the style of architecture according to which idol temples are now built in that country. The latter resembles the Egyptian; for the towers are always pyramidal, and the gates and roofs flat and without arches; but these sculptures approach nearer to the Gothic.\"\n\n* See Shaw's Travels, p. 155, &c.\n\n(A) See a figure of Vishnu in the plate of Indian gods, with its description, under the article Polytheism.\nthis taste, being surmounted by arched roofs or domes that are not semicircular, but composed of two segments of circles meeting in a point at top.\" Our author observes, that the lion in this group, as well as one on a stone couch in what he took to be a royal palace, are perfectly just representations of the true lion, and the natives there give them the name which is always understood to mean a lion in the Hindoo language, to wit, sing; but the figure which they have made to represent that animal in their idol temples for centuries past, though it bears the same appellation, is a distorted monster totally unlike the original; inasmuch that it has from hence been supposed, that the lion was not anciently known in this country, and that sing was a name given to a monster that existed only in Hindoo romance. But it is plain that that animal was well known to the authors of these works, who, in manners as well as arts, seem to have differed much from the modern Hindoos.\n\n\"There are two circumstances attending these monuments which cannot but excite great curiosity, and on which future inquiries may possibly throw some light. One is, that on one of the pagodas last mentioned, there is an inscription of a single line, in a character at present unknown to the Hindoos. It resembles neither the Deyva-nâgâre, nor any of the various characters connected with or derived from it, which have come to the writer's knowledge from any part of Hindoostan. Nor did it, at the time he viewed it, appear to correspond with any character, Asiatic or European, that is commonly known. He had not then, however, seen the alphabet of the Balic, the learned language of the Siamese, a sight of which has since raised in his mind a suspicion that there is a near affinity between them, if the character be not identically the same. But as these conjectures, after such a lapse of time, are somewhat vague, and the subject of them is perhaps yet within the reach of our researches, it is to be hoped that some method may be fallen upon of procuring an exact copy of this inscription.\n\n\"The other circumstance is, that though the outward form of the pagodas is complete, the ultimate design of them has manifestly not been accomplished, but seems to have been defeated by some extraordinary convulsion of nature. For the western side of the most northerly one is excavated to the depth of four or five feet, and a row of pillars left on the outside to support the roof; but here the work has been stopped, and an uniform rent of about four inches breadth has been made throughout the solid rock, and appears to extend to its foundations, which are probably at a prodigious depth below the surface of the ground. That this rent has happened since the work began, or while it was carrying on, cannot be doubted; for the marks of the masons' tools are perfectly visible in the excavated part on both sides of the rent, in such a manner as to show plainly that they have been divided by it. Nor is it reasonable to suppose, that such a work would ever have been designed or begun upon a rock that had previously been rent in two. Nothing less than an earthquake, and that a violent one, could apparently have produced such a fissure in the solid rock; and that this has been the case in point of fact, may be gathered from other circumstances, which it is necessary to mention in an account of this curious place. The great rock above described is at some small distance from the sea, perhaps 50 or 100 yards, and in that space the Hindoo village before mentioned stood in 1776. But close to the sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick, and dedicated to Sith, the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that element; for the door of the innermost apartment, in which the idol is placed, and before which there are always two or three spacious courts surrounded with walls, is now washed by the waves, and the pillar used to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen standing at some distance in the sea. In the neighborhood of this building there are some detached rocks, washed also by the waves, on which there appear sculptures, though now much worn and defaced. And the natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several pagodas far out in the sea, which being covered with copper, (probably gilt,) were particularly visible at sunrise, as their shining surface used then to reflect the sun's rays, but that now that effect was no longer produced, as the copper had since become incrusted with the mould and verdigris.\"\n\nFrom these circumstances our author conjectures, and we think reasonably, that the magnificent city of which these appear to be part of the ruins, has been destroyed partly by an earthquake, by which the rock was rent, and partly by a sudden inundation of the sea, occasioned by this commotion of the earth. The bramins give an account of this matter peculiar to themselves, filled with extravagance, fable, and folly; from which, however, with the affluence of ancient monuments, coins, and inscriptions, some probable conjectures at least, if not important discoveries, may, it is hoped, be made on these subjects; which are far from being uninteresting to us either as men, philosophers, or Christians. Our author thinks, therefore, that the inscription on the pagoda mentioned above is an object which merits considerable attention; and he defends, by very reputable authorities, the conjecture which places it among the languages of Siam; but which it is unnecessary for us either to abridge or to transcribe. In the course of this inquiry, our author remarks a very near resemblance between Semonnecodon, the idol of the Siamese, and the great idol Buddu, held sacred by the Chingelays; and this resemblance extends also to their priests. But from the detail of circumstances which our author brings forward, and to which we refer, he thinks this a system of religion different from that of the Vedas, and some of them totally inconsistent with the principles and practice of the bramins; none of whom, as far as we can collect from Mr Knox's History of Ceylon, exist among the Chingelays, whose religion is totally different from that of the present Hindoos. The only part in which there seems to be any agreement is in the worship of the Deity, which has probably crept in among them from their Tamulian neighbours, but that is carried on in a manner very different from the brahmical system, and appears to be held by the nation at large in very great contempt, if not abhorrence. Knox's account of it is this: \"Their temples (i.e. those of the Deity) are called caves,\" which is the Tamulic word for pagoda. He then goes on to say, \"a man piously disposed builds a small house at his own charge,\ncharge, which is the temple, and himself becomes priest thereof. This house is seldom called God's house, but most usually Jacco the devil's.\" But of the prevailing religion he speaks in very different terms, and describes it as carried on with much parade and splendour, and attended with marks of great antiquity. \"The pagodas or temples of their gods (says he) are so many, that I cannot number them. Many of them are of rare and exquisite work, built of hewn stone, engraved with images and figures, but by whom and when I could not attain to know, the inhabitants themselves being ignorant therein. But sure I am they were built by far more ingenious artificers than the Chingelays that now are on the land. For the Portuguese in their invasions have defaced some of them, which there is none found that hath skill enough to repair to this day.\" In another place, he says, \"here are some ancient writings engraven upon rocks, which puzzle all that see them. There are divers great rocks in divers parts in Cande Uda, and in the northern parts. These rocks are cut deep with great letters for the space of some yards, so deep that they may last to the world's end. Nobody can read them or make any thing of them. I have asked Malabars and Gentooes, as well as Chingelays and Moors, but none of them understood them. There is an ancient temple, Godiladenni in Yattanour, stand by a place where there are of these letters.\" From all which the antiquity of the nation and their religion is sufficiently evident, and from other passages it is plain, that the worship of Buddou, in particular, has been from remote times a very eminent part of their religion; for the same author, speaking of the tree at Anurodburro, in the northern part of the island, which is sacred to Buddou, says, \"the due performance of this worship they reckon not a little meritorious: inasmuch that, as they report, so kings have reigned there successively, where, by the ruins that still remain, it appears they spared not for pains and labour, to build temples and high monuments to the honour of this god, as if they had been born to hew rocks and great stones, and lay them up in heaps. These kings are now happy spirits, having merited it by these labours.\" And again he says, \"For this god, above all others, they seem to have a high respect and devotion,\" &c.\n\nSuch is the nature of Mr Chamber's communication, as far as it respects pagodas; a subject to which the Asiatic Society will doubtless again direct their attention; and from the penetration and fidelity of its members we have much to expect. Other parts of this paper shall be brought forwards under other articles, to which we refer. Few researches are of more service to true religion, than those which give us a correct view of the false and superstitious modes of worship practised by men who have had no light but reason, or weak and corrupted traditions. They are useful likewise to the philosopher, as they always tend to give us a minuter view of the real nature of man as he is in himself, and show with sufficient strength the imbecility of the human intellect without some supernatural aid. The external pomp of all Pagan religions seems to have been their essence; a circumstance which alone shows the necessity of that, the intention of which is to reform the heart. See SIAM, SOMMONACODON, TEMPLE, &c.\n\nPAGOD, or PAGODA, is also the name of a gold and silver coin, current in several parts of the East Indies.\n\nPAIN, an uneasy sensation, arising from a sudden and violent solution of continuity, or other accident in the nerves, membranes, vessels, muscles, &c. of the body. Pain, according to some, consists in a motion of the organs of sense; and, according to others, it is an emotion of the soul occasioned by those organs.\n\nAs the brain is the seat of sensation, so it is of pain. Boerhaave, and most other authors on this subject, assign a stretching of the nerves as the only immediate cause of pain; but as the nerves do not appear to consist of fibres, this cause of pain does not seem to be well-founded; nor indeed will it be easy to treat this subject clearly, but in proportion as the means of sensation are understood.\n\nMany kinds of pain are met with in authors: such as,\n\nA gravitative pain; in which there is a sense of weight on the part affected, which is always some flethly part, as the liver, &c. A pullative pain; which, Galen says, always succeeds some remarkable inflammation in the containing parts, and is observed in abscesses while suppurating. A tensive pain, which is also called a distending pain; it is excited by the distention of some nervous, muscular, or membranous part, either from some humour, or from flatulence. An acute pain is, when great pain is attended with quick and lively sensations: A dull pain is, when a kind of numbness is as much complained of as the pain is.\n\nThe mediate and more remote causes of pain are generally obvious; and when this is the case, the cure will consist for the most part in removing them: for though in many instances the chief complaint is very distant from the seat of those causes, yet their removal is the proper method of relief. See MEDICINE, p. 153.\n\nPerhaps all pains may be included, with irritation, in those that have spasm or inflammation for their source. When pain is owing to inflammation, the pulse is quicker than in a natural state; it is also generally full, hard, and tense; the pain is equal, throbbing, and unremitting. If a spasm be the cause, the pulse is rarely affected; at intervals the pain abates, and then returns with some degree of aggravation; gentle motion sometimes abates, or even cures, in some instances; but in inflammatory cases no such effects are ever experienced. See Dr Lobb's Treatise on Painful Distempers.\n\nThe pain so frequently attendant on women in childbirth, called after-pains (from their happening only after being delivered of a child), are often occasioned by attempts to bring away coagulated blood, which is a needless endeavour. When no improper treatment in delivering the secondines can be suspected, the irritability of the uterus alone is to be considered as the cause. Care should be taken not to confound these after-pains with, or mistake the pains attending puerperal fevers for the colic. After-pains come by fits, and soon go off; but return at different intervals, which are longer each day, and after two or three days are usually at an end, though sometimes they continue seven or eight: notwithstanding these pains, the lochia flow properly, and generally more abundantly after the cessation of each fit; this does not happen in colicky complaints, nor is the belly so free from tumefaction when the puerperal fever is attendant.\n\nAs these pains are of the spasmodic kind, ancynes\nand gentle opiates, with frequent draughts of warm cau-\ndle, chamomile tea, &c. with external fomentation, are\nall that are required in order to their relief.\n\nAmong the various causes of pain, a singular one is\nrelated in the third vol. of the Lond. Med. Obs. and Inq.\np. 241. &c. Some persons who had taken cold during\ntheir being salivated, were afflicted with pains which\nrefused all the usual methods of relief. At length the\nauthor of the narrative referred to suggested the caule;\nand by exciting a fresh salivation the pains abated;\nthe spitting was kept up a little while, and permitted\nto abate with some caution; and thus the cures were\ncompleted.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nPAINTING is the art of representing to the eye, by\nmeans of figures and colours, every object in nature\nthat is discernible by the sight: and of sometimes ex-\npressing, according to the principles of physiognomy,\nand by the attitudes of the body, the various emotions\nof the mind. A smooth surface, by means of lines and\ncolours, represents objects in a state of projection; and\nmay represent them in the most pleasant dress, and\nin a manner most capable of enchanting the senses.\nStill farther, the objects which delight us by their ani-\nmation, and lively colours, speak to the soul, by giving\nus the image of what we hold most dear, or by indica-\nting an action which inspires us with a taste for innocent\npleasures, with courage, and with elevated sentiments.\nSuch is the definition, and such are the effects of\npainting.\n\nBy an admirable effort of human genius, painting of-\nfers to the eye everything which is most valuable in\nthe universe. Its empire extends over every age and\ncountry. It presents to us the heroic deeds of ancient\ntimes as well as the facts in which we are more conver-\ntant, and distant objects as well as those which we daily\nsee. In this respect it may be considered as a supple-\nment to nature, which gives us only a view of present\nobjects.\n\nThe art of painting is extremely difficult in the exe-\ncution; and its merit can only be appreciated by those\nwho profess the art.\n\nThe painter who invents, composes, and colours con-\nceptions which are only agreeable, and which speak\nmerely to the eye of the spectator, may be reckoned to\npossess the first merit in the style of embellishment and\ndecoration.\n\nThe painter who is distinguished for noble and pro-\nfound conceptions; who, by means of a perfect deline-\nation, and colours more capable of fixing the attention\nthan dazzling the eye, conveys to the spectators the sen-\ntiments with which he himself was inspired; who ani-\nmates them with his genius, and makes a lasting impres-\nsion on their minds; this art is a poet, and worthy to\nshare even in the glories of Homer.\n\nIt is in forming this great idea of his art that the\npainter becomes himself great.\n\nBut if he seek only to please or astonish by the illu-\nsion of colours, he must rest contented with the second-\nary merit of flattering the eye with the variety and op-\nposition of tints, or of making an indistinctive assemblage\nof a great multiplicity of objects. It is in painting as\nit is in poetry. The man who clothes trivial or com-\nmon ideas in verse, exercises the profession of twisting\nlyrics into a certain measure. The poet who clothes\nin good verse, ideas and sentiments that are merely agree-\nable, professes an agreeable art. But he who by the\nmagic of verse, of ideas, of imagery, or of colours, adds\nsublimity to the sublime objects of nature, is a great\npoet and a great painter. He deserves the crown which\nthe nations have decreed to Homer, Virgil, Milton, Ra-\nphael, and the statuary who modelled the ancient Apol-\nlo. It is reasonable to place in the same class those who\nhave expressed the same ideas, whether it be in verse or\nin colours, on brafs or on marble. The painter and sta-\ntuary, who excel in their professions, deserve all the re-\nspect due to genius: they are of the number of those\nmen whom nature, sparing of her best gifts, grants but\noccasionally to the inhabitants of the earth. If they\nare sublime, they elevate the human race; if they are\nagreeable only, they excite those sweet sensations neces-\nsary to our happiness.\n\nIn laying before our readers a succinct account of\nthis noble art, we shall, first, give the history of paint-\ning, including its rise, progress, and decline, in ancient\nand modern times; an account of the schools, and of\nthe different merits of painters; and a comparison be-\ntween the ancient and modern painting. Secondly, we\nshall lay down the principles of the art, and the order\nin which the artist conducts his studies. Thirdly, we\nshall enumerate the different classes of painting, with\nobservations on each. And, Fourthly, we shall treat of\neconomical or house painting.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nSECT. I. Rise, Progress, and Decline of Painting in\nAncient and Modern Times.\n\nIt is to be imagined that men must naturally, and\nvery early, have conceived an idea of the first principles\nof the art of painting; the shadow of each plant and\nanimal, and of every object in nature, must have afford-\ned them the means of conceiving, and pointed out the\npossibility of imitating, the figures of all bodies. Thus\nthe savage nations, an emblem of what men were in the\ninfancy of society, possess the first rudiments of this art,\neven before those which are useful and almost necessary\nto existence; their naked bodies are covered with punctu-\nres of various forms, into which they infuse indelible\ncolours. The next demand for this art, is to preserve\nthe memory of warlike exploits. It is more natural to\nform some representation of an action, than to give an\naccount of it by means of arbitrary characters. Hence\nthe picture-writing of the Mexicans, and the more com-\nplex hieroglyphics of Egypt.\n\nPainting consisted of simple outlines long before the\nexpression of relievo, or the application of colour. It\nwas simply drawing; and the master-pieces of painting in that rude period were not superior to the spots of children. Although occupied about a single point, it was not brought to perfection; for constant experience instructs us that men never excel in the inferior parts of an art till they are capable of carrying the whole to perfection.\n\nAfter employing for a long time those simple outlines, the next step in the art of painting was to make the imitation more complete by applying colours: this was first accomplished by covering the different parts of the figure with different colours, in the same way that we colour maps; and several nations, as the Egyptians, the Chinese, and the different nations of India, have never painted in a better manner. Other nations, more ingenious and more attentive to the arts, observing that the objects of nature have reliefs, have invented what is called chiaro-oscuro. The Greeks, the most ingenious, penetrating, and delicate of all, invented this part antecedent to colours; than which there cannot be a greater proof of their exquisite taste, as the glare of colours without judgment excites more admiration in the minds of the vulgar and ignorant, than the cameos or drawings of one colour executed by the most skilful artist.\n\nThese general observations concerning the gradual improvement of this art, will be best illustrated by a more particular attention to the ancient nations in which it flourished.\n\nPlato, who lived 400 years before the Christian era, informs us that painting had been practised in Egypt for ten thousand years; that some of the productions of that high antiquity were in existence; and that they bore an exact resemblance to those which the Egyptians executed in his time. Without regarding the period of ten thousand years mentioned by Plato, it is reasonable to consider it as an indeterminate period, which carries us back to very remote antiquity.\n\nThe figures either in the painting or sculpture of Egypt were extremely stiff; the legs were drawn together, and their arms were pasted to their sides. It appears that their only model was their mummies, and that their skill in anatomy was derived from embalming them. They were extremely incorrect in every part of the head; they placed the ears much higher than the nose. Besides, they gave the face the form of a circle instead of an oval; the chin was short and rounded; the cheeks excessively so; and they turned upwards the corners of the mouth and eyes. Many of these faults may be ascribed to the formation of the human face in Egypt; but the placing of the ears could only be founded in caprice or ignorance.\n\nThe exactness of the Egyptian proportion is much celebrated; but although we grant that they observed the proper length of the different parts of the human body, they were still defective artists, since they did not observe the breadth, and were moreover ignorant altogether of the shape and size of the muscles. Works converted to religious purposes chiefly occupied the Egyptian painters. They had figures for imitation from which they would not depart, and those figures were monstrous; the bodies of animals with the heads of men; the bodies of men with the heads of animals; or if the figure was more agreeable to nature in its parts, yet it was so deformed and imaginary, as to have nothing similar to it as a whole in the creation of God.\n\nThe monuments of Egyptian painting with which we are best acquainted (says Winklemann) are the chests of mummies. These works have resisted the injuries of time, and are still submitted to the examination of the curious. The white, made of white lead, is spread over the ground of the piece; the outlines of the figure are traced with black strokes, and the colours are four in number; namely, blue, red, yellow, and green, laid on without any mixture or shading. The red and blue prevail most; and those colours seem to have been prepared in the coarsest manner. The light is formed by leaving those parts of the ground where it is necessary, covered with the white lead, as it is formed by the white paper in some of our drawings. This description is sufficient to convince us that the whole art of painting in Egypt consisted in colouring; but every person knows that without tints and the mixture of colours painting can never arrive at great perfection.\n\nIn Upper Egypt there seems to have existed a kind of coëtian painting, which has never been examined except by travellers who were no great critics in the art. Winklemann had some reason to express a desire that those remains of antiquity, with regard to the manner of working, the style, and the character, had been accurately explored. Walls of 24 feet in height, and pillars of 32 feet in circumference, are wholly covered with those coëtian figures. According to Norden they are coloured in the same manner with the mummies; the colours are applied to a ground prepared in manner of fresco; and they have retained their freshness for many thousand years. Winklemann adds, that all the efforts of human skill and industry could make as little impression on them as the injuries of time. His enthusiasm for antiquity has perhaps led him into this extravagant exaggeration.\n\nIt appears that the great employment of the Egyptian painters was on earthen vessels, on drinking cups, in ornamenting barges, and in covering with figures the chests of mummies. They painted also on cloth; but painting, as an industrious occupation, supposes a workman, not an artist: the decoration of temples, hence painting, and that of the figures relative to religion, are to be considered only in this point of view. The workmen in Ruffia who paint our Saviour holding the globe in one hand, and blessing the people with the other, are not members of the imperial academy of fine arts.\n\nPliny informs us that the Egyptian artists painted also the precious metals; that is to say, they varnished or enamelled them. It is doubtful what this art was, but most probably it consisted in covering gold or silver with a single colour.\n\nThe Egyptians are supposed to have continued this coarse style till the reign of the Ptolemies.\n\nThe Persians were so far from excelling in the arts, In Persia, that the paintings of Egypt were highly esteemed among them after they had conquered that country.\n\nThe carpets of Persia were of great value in Greece, even in the time of Alexander the Great, and these were adorned with various figures; but this is no proof that they were well executed, any more than a demand for several of the Chinese productions is at present a proof of the taste of that people in the arts. It was the fabrication of the silk, and not the truth of the representation, which made the Greeks admire the carpets of the Persians.\nThe Persians, as well as the Arabians, had some knowledge of mosaic work. This is only valuable when it copies, in a manner that cannot be destroyed, the works of a great master; but if the Persians had no good pictures to copy into mosaic, it was of no consequence to be able to arrange, in a solid manner, pieces of flint one beside another.\n\nThere is only one Persian painter whose name has descended to posterity; and he is preserved, not because he was a painter, but because he accommodated the ancient doctrine of the two principles to the Christian religion. Besides, it is doubted whether Manes was a Persian or a Greek, and it is still less known whether he was a painter. He is praised in Asia for drawing straight lines without a ruler.\n\nThe modern Persians have made no kind of progress in the arts. The emperor Shah Abbas, wishing from caprice to be instructed in drawing, was obliged to have recourse to a Dutch painter who happened to be in his dominions.\n\nThe modern Persians paint on cloth, and the artists in India are their rivals in this branch of industry; but their paintings are purely capricious. They represent plants and flowers which have no existence in nature; and their only merit consists in the brightness and the strength of their colours.\n\nBesides this, the art in India, as it was in the most remote antiquity, is confined to monstrous figures connected with their religion, animals not to be found in the world, and idols with a multitude of arms and heads, which have neither exactness in their forms nor proportions. See Polytheism.\n\nThe paintings of Tibet discover great patience in the artist, and are remarkable for the fineness of their strokes. Their painters might dispute with Apelles and Protogenes for extreme tenacity of pencil; but it is in this alone, without any regard to the art, in which their merit consists.\n\nSome of the idols in Thibet are executed in a certain style of relievè; but those productions are not only imperfect, they are also so destitute of beauty as to forbid every hope of excellence in the art. The same thing may be observed with regard to many of the eastern nations; they seem to have that want of style which would forever condemn them to mediocrity, even if they should happen to arrive at it.\n\nAn obscure Italian painter named Giovanni Ghirardi, who travelled into China, whose judgment is more to be depended on in an art which he practised than that of other travellers, declares that the Chinese have not the least idea of the fine arts; and this opinion is confirmed by every thing which we know of that people.\n\nThe Chinese seem not to have the smallest conception of perspective. Their landscapes have no plan, no variety in the appearance of the clouds, and no diminishing of the objects in proportion to their distance.\n\nThe great object of their painting seems to consist in making their figures as unlike nature as possible; it is a curious caricature of the human figure.\n\nTo make the art flourish, it is necessary that the artist be esteemed and rewarded. In China, there is no artist so poorly paid as the painter.\n\nThe ignorant admire the brightness and purity of their colours; but simple colours appear always bright and pure. The difficulty of the art consists in melting them into one another in such a manner that the mixture shall not be perceived. It must at the same time be confessed, that their natural colours are more brilliant than ours; but if there be any merit in this, it is to be ascribed to their climate, not to their ability.\n\nA Jesuit missionary, who in his youth had been a grinder of colours, was raised to the greatest eminence as a painter in the Imperial court of China, and Raphael himself was never so much respected. The Chinese battles sent from that country to Paris to be engraved, are the work of the Jesuits; and except they were done by the Chinese themselves, it is impossible to conceive that they could be worse executed.\n\nThe Chinese, like other eastern nations, have a few simple strokes which they repeat in all their variety of figures. In the figures on the earthen ware, they discover no knowledge of forms, no expression of the most conspicuous muscles, and no idea of proportion. And in all the paintings of China anatomy seems to bear no relation to the art. Some heads done by a Chinese painter have a sort of resemblance to nature, but they are in a low and vicious taste; the fulness of the drapery conceals the parts in such a manner that they do not seem to exist under it. Sculpture in China is in a state of no great perfection, but at the same time it is better executed than their paintings.\n\nThe ancient inhabitants of Etruria, now called Tuscany, were the first who connected the arts with the study of nature. In some of their monuments which still remain, there is to be observed a first style, which shows the art in its infancy; and a second, which, like the works of the Florentine artists, shows more of greatness and exaggeration in the character than precision or beauty.\n\nPliny says that painting was carried to great perfection in Italy before the foundation of Rome; perhaps he means in comparison with the infancy of the art in Greece at that period; but it appears that even in his time the painters of Etruria were held in great reputation.\n\nThe only Etrurian paintings which remain, have been found in the tombs of the Tarquins. They consist of long painted friezes, and pilasters adorned with huge figures, which occupied the whole space from the base to the cornice. These paintings are executed on a ground of thick mortar, and many of them are in a state of high preservation.\n\nWinklemann is of opinion that the Greek colonies in Campania established at Naples and Nola, had at a very early period cultivated the imitative arts, and taught them to the Campanians established in the middle of the country. This learned antiquarian considers as works purely Campanian, certain medals of Capua and Teanum, cities of Campania into which the Greek colonies never penetrated. The head of a young Hercules, and the head of a Jupiter, according to Winklemann, are executed in the finest manner. It is still a question, however, in the learned world, whether these medals owe their existence to Carthage or to Campania.\n\n\"But there has been discovered (adds Winklemann) a great number of Campanian vases covered with painting. The design of the greatest part of these vases (says he) is such, that the figures might occupy a distinguished...\"\nWe have already seen, that before the foundation of Rome, the arts were cultivated in Etruria. They were also early introduced into Latium; but whether that country employed its own artists or those of Etruria, remains altogether uncertain. One need not be afraid among the Romans, that at a period when the arts were in their infancy in Greece, they were raising statues to their kings in Rome; but at that period all their artists were Etruscans or Latins; and when they conquered Italy, they made all the nations of it as barbarous as they were themselves.\n\nIn the year 259 from the building of the city of Rome, and 494 years before the Christian era, Appius Claudius consecrated a number of shields in the temple of Bellona, which contained in basso relievo the portraits of his family. This example was followed; and in process of time it was common among the Romans to place those images in private houses. The execution in basso relievo is a proof that they had an idea of painting, at least with one colour. As long as the Romans employed artists of other nations, they had little desire to cultivate the arts; but towards the year of Rome 430, and 303 years before Christ, one of the Fabii thought it no discredit to a noble family to employ himself in painting. He painted the temple of Safety; and his works remained till that temple was destroyed by fire, in the reign of Claudius. It is worthy of remark, that the same man was the first painter and the first historian in his country.\n\nThe example of Fabius, named Plator from his profession, did not excite his fellow citizens to imitation. A century and a half elapsed before the tragic poet Pacuvius, nephew of Ennius, painted the temple of Hercules in the forum boarium. The glory which he had acquired by his dramatic works thenceforth lustrate on the art, which he endeavoured to exercise; but did not confer on it that respect which could recommend it to general practice. The paintings of Fabius were the works, or rather the recreations of his youth; those of Pacuvius, the amusements of his old age: but painting is a difficult art, which requires the whole attention, and which can never be prosecuted with success, except those who love it are solely devoted to the performance.\n\nIt appears that there were no eminent painters at Rome till the time of the emperors; but as the national spirit was changed, the profession of the fine arts acquired more respectability. The Romans, during the time of the republic, were animated with the spirit of liberty and the desire for conquest. When these passions were weakened, the love of the arts obtained among them. As a proof of this it is sufficient to say, that Nero himself gloried in being an artist. A colossal picture of 120 feet was painted at Rome by the command of this emperor, which was afterward destroyed by lightning. The name of the painter is not recorded, and there are various opinions concerning the merit of the performance; but the thing chiefly worthy of observation is, that this is the only painting on cloth mentioned by ancient authors.\n\nThe paintings of the ancient artists were either moveable or on the ceilings or compartments of buildings. According to Pliny, the most eminent were those who painted moveable pictures. The latter were either on ancient fir-wood, larch, boxwood, or canvas, as in the colossal picture.\nPAINTING.\n\nRise, Pro- picture mentioned above, and sometimes on marble. When they employed wood, they laid on in the first instance a white ground. Among the antiquities of Herculaneum are four paintings on white marble.\n\nTheir immovable paintings on walls were either in fresco or on the dry stucco in distemper. Indeed all the ancient paintings may be reduced to, firstly, fresco painting; secondly, water colour, or distemper painting on a dry ground; and, thirdly, encaustic painting.\n\nThe ancient fresco-paintings appear to have been always on a white stucco-ground, the colours inlaid very deep, and the drawing much more bold and free than any similar performance of modern art. The outlines of the ancient paintings on fresco were probably done at once, as appears from the depth of the incision and the boldness and freedom of the design, equal to the care and spirit of a pencilled outline.\n\nIn general the ancients painted on a dry ground even in their buildings, as appears from the Herculanean antiquities, most of which are executed in this manner. At Rome and Naples, the first (deepest) coat is of true puzzolana, of the same nature with the tarros now used in mortar, required to keep out wet, about one finger thick; the next of ground marble or alabaster, and sometimes of pure lime or stucco, in thickness about one third of the former. Upon this they appear to have laid a coat of black, and then another of red paint; on which last the subject itself was executed. Such seems to have been their method of painting on walls; but in their moveable pictures, and in the performance of their first artists, where effect of shade and light were necessary, they doubtless used white.\n\nThe colours employed they seem to have mixed up with size, of which they preferred that made by boiling the ears and genitals of bulls. This appears to have made the colours so durable and adhesive, that the ancient paintings lately found bear washing with a soft cloth and water; and sometimes even diluted aquafortis is employed to clean their paintings on fresco. Pliny says that glue dissolved in vinegar and then dried, is not again soluble.\n\nWhat the encaustic painting of the ancients was, has been much disputed. From the works of Vitruvius and Pliny, it appears evidently that it was of three kinds.\n\nFirstly, Where a picture painted in the common way, was covered with a varnish of wax melted, diluted with a little oil, and laid on warm with a brush.\n\nSecondly, Where the colours themselves were mixed up with melted wax, and the mixture used while warm. And,\n\nThirdly, Where a painting was executed on ivory by means of the cefrum or variculum.\n\nSome experiments on this last method by Mr Colebrook may be found in the Phil. Trans. vol. 51. and more particular directions in Muntz's Treatise on Encaustic Painting.\n\nIt appears from ancient writings of the best authority, that in the earliest and purest times of this art, the painters used few colours, perhaps not more than four. \"The paintings of the ancients (says Dionysius Halicarnaeus) were simple and unvaried in their colouring, but correct in their drawing, and distinguished by their elegance. Those which succeeded, less correct in their drawing, were more finished, more varied in their light and shades, trifling their effect to the multitude of their rise, pro-colours.\" But no certain conclusion can be drawn, that rise, and decline a more early among the great painters of the ancients, such as Apollodorus, Zeuxis, Timanthes, &c. had only four different colours, merely because they did not use them. On the contrary, it may be conjectured with some degree of probability, from their chasteness in design, and from the complaints Pliny makes of the gaudy taste of the Roman painters, that the Greeks in general were diligently chaste in their colouring, and not to merely from necessity, at least about the time of Zeuxis and Apelles; for the former could not have painted grapes so naturally as he is said to have done with four colours only; and the rebuke given by the latter to one of his scholars who had painted an Helen very gaudily, is a confirmation of these observations. \"Young man (says Apelles), not being able to make her beautiful, you have made her rich.\"\n\nOf white colouring substances, the ancients had white lead variously prepared, a white from calcined eggshells, and preparations from cretaceous and argillaceous earths. The moderns in addition have magistery of bitumen, little used; and ought to have the calces of tin and zinc.\n\nOf blacks, the ancients had preparations similar to lamp, ivory, blue, and Franckfort black; also to Indian ink, and common writing ink; and they used, what we do not, the precipitate of the black dyers vats.\n\nThe ancients possessed a species of vermilion or fine cinnabar, a coarser cinnabar, red lead, various earths burnt and unburnt, apparently similar to our red ochre, Venetian red, Indian red, Spanish brown, burnt terra de Siena, and scarlet ochre; they had also a substance alike in colour and in name to our dragon's blood.\n\nThe yellow pigments of the ancients were generically the same with our orpiments, king's-yellow, Naples yellow, &c. They did not possess turpeth-mineral, mineral yellow, or gamboge; nor do they appear to have known of gall-stone as a pigment.\n\nOf blue paints they had preparations from the lapis cyanus and lapis armenius. Indigo they had, and perhaps bice and final; for they made blue glaubs, but whether from same ore of cobalt or of wolfram must be uncertain: they had not Prussian blue, verditer, or litmus, which we have. We do not use the blue precipitate of the dyers vats, or mountain blue, which they certainly employed.\n\nOf green colours they had verdegris, terre verte, and malachite, or mountain green. The latter is not in use among us. Sap green, green verditer, and Scheele's green, appear to have been unknown to them: like us, they procured as many tints as they pleased from blue and yellow vegetables.\n\nWe have no original purple in use: that from gold by means of tin, though very good, when well prepared, is too dear perhaps, and unnecessary. Their purple was a tinged earth. Their orange or sandarac (red orpiment) we also possess. Hence there does not appear to have been any great want of pigments, or any very material difference between the colours they used and such as we generally employ. Perhaps the full effect of colouring may be obtained without the use of exceeding brilliant pigments, depending chiefly on the proportion and opposition of tints.\nThe ancients could not know anything about the spirit varnishes, distillation being a modern invention; but they were undoubtedly acquainted with the use of the better oil varnishes, that is, with the use and effect of resinous gums dissolved in boiling infusible oils.\n\nOne of the best preserved mummies in the British Museum has an astonishing brightness of colours on the outside of the coffin. Thousands of years have not impaired them; they are as fresh as if they had been laid on yesterday.\n\nThe chalk ground, and the excellency of the colours, some of which imply a good deal of chemical and metallurgical knowledge, do not sufficiently account for their splendour and freshness: it must be owing to other circumstances; either to the mixture of thinning colours, or to a hard glossy skin, which visibly covers them all over.\n\nFrom an accurate examination of one of those mummies belonging to the university of Cambridge, it appeared, that the varnish which covered the colours could not be dissolved, or in the least affected by common water; and that it equally resisted the dissolving power of the strongest spirits: hence it is reasonable to conclude that the coffins of the mummies were not covered with size, white of eggs, simple gums, or any preparation of wax, but with a fine transparent oil varnish. It was discovered at the same time, that the colours themselves were not prepared or mixed with oil; for where the external glossy skin was damaged, broken, or rubbed off, even common water would wash the colours away, and affect the chalk ground under them.\n\nPliny has described the general and particular effects of the varnish of Apelles, under the name of atramentum, so indistinctly, that nobody can distinguish the thing or the mixture he is speaking of. He has mentioned the shining glossy skin of the varnish which excites the brightness of the colours, and preserves them against dust; he observed, that this skin was laid on so thin, that it could not be discerned at any distance; nor was he less accurate in reporting the particular effects of that mixture which Apelles made use of; it harmonized and lowered the tone of the brightest florid colours in an imperceptible manner, and the whole appeared as if it had been seen through glass. The chemists and connoisseurs are fully of opinion, that no liquid substance or mixture of any kind is fit to produce these effects besides the oil varnishes; and if there are not, Apelles and the Greeks were certainly acquainted with those varnishes; a fact which might be strongly urged in behalf of their knowledge of oil colours.\n\nThe black outlines of the figures on the most ancient Greek paintings yet extant, that is, on Etruscan vases, are so sharp, so thick, and drawn in so easy and masterly a manner, that one cannot help looking upon them as having been drawn in oil colours. Had they been in distemper or water colours on the red clay ground on which they are applied, they would have been imbibed and soaked into it. Our china and enamel painters prepare and apply their colours with jipike or other liquid oils; and the Greek masters seem to have done the same, unless they should appear to have burnt their vases before they painted them, or to have used a mixture of dissolved wax or gum for giving a body to their colours, which might have answered the same ends as oils. And this is the more probable, as there is some reason to believe that these vases went through two different fires, that of baking them, and that of melting or burning in their colours.\n\nThe Greek and Roman paintings that have been preserved or discovered at Rome and Herculaneum do not countenance the supposition of oil colours; at least Turnhull and the academists at Naples, who have described the royal collection at Portici, Cochin, and many other authors who have seen and described them, do not hint anything of that nature. On the other hand, Vitruvius, who has left us so many valuable notices of the ancient arts, acquaints us, that there was a kind of painting which absolutely required a mixture of oil: And Pliny, to the same purpose, expressly says, \"Sun and moon shine are mimical and obnoxious to red lead.\" The remedy is to apply the red wax when hot and melted with some oil on the well dried walls, which is to be done with brushes.\"\n\nFrom these observations, the evidence which the ancients have given us in behalf of themselves, and of their knowledge of oil painting, may be summed up in few words.\n\nTheir having been acquainted with the white chalk ground, which many modern masters have used for oil painting on boards, proves no more than that the ancients might have done the same.\n\nThe oil varnishes used by the Egyptians and by Apelles might have brought them to the discovery of oil painting; but as it appears both from mummies and from the works of Pliny, that their colours were not prepared and mixed with that varnish, and as it is plain rather that this varnish was externally laid over the finished pictures; no other conclusion can be drawn, except that they were within sight of the discovery, and that it is a matter of wonder that they should not have laid hold of it.\n\nThe outlines of the old Greek or Etruscan vases are merely fallacious appearances.\n\nThe old Greek and Roman paintings on walls and stones are either painted in distemper and fresco, or they have not been sufficiently examined.\n\nThe oil used in the coarser wax and wall paintings proves at most that experiments had been tried with oils; but we have no direct proofs of oil painting having been understood or used by the Egyptians, Greeks, or Romans; and that, however great their skill or ingenuity, they might very well have been within sight and reach of the discovery, and nevertheless have missed it.\n\nThe art of painting was revived in Europe about the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th century. The decline of human mind, however, plunged in profound ignorance, was destitute of every principle of sound philosophy which might enable it to determine on the objects of the art; and of consequence the painters contented themselves with works adapted to the general taste, without beauty and without proportion. In Italy, where the first attempts were made, they were employed in representing the mysteries of the passion, and subjects of a similar nature, on the walls of chapels and churches. Their labours were directed to a vast number of figures, rather than to the beauty and perfection of each; and the art in more modern times has always preserved somewhat of this absurd fault which it contracted at that early period. The artist in our times is not, like those in Greece, at liberty to\ndevote his talents only to men of knowledge and discernment; he is constrained to please those who are rich, and very frequently those who are ignorant. Instead of proposing to himself the perfection of the art as the great object of his pursuit, he must rest his success and character on the facility of his operation and the abundance of his works.\n\nPainting did not long continue in the imperfect condition in which it was left by those who first cultivated it among the moderns. It was natural that their successors should endeavour to surpass them by joining some degree of theory to the barbarous practice they had adopted. The first thing which they discovered, or rather which they revived after the manner of the ancients, was perspective. This made the artists capable of expressing what is called foreborehing, and of giving more effect and more truth to their works.\n\nDominique Ghirlandaio, a Florentine, was the first who enriched the style of his composition by grouping his figures, and who gave depth to his pictures, by distinguishing, by exact gradations, the spaces which his figures occupied; but his successors have far surpassed him in boldness of composition.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, Giorgian, Titian, Bartholomew de St Marc, and Raphael, flourished about the end of the 14th century. Leonardo da Vinci was the inventor of a great many details in the art: Michael Angelo, by studying the ancients, and by his knowledge of anatomy, arrived at great elegance in drawing the outlines of his figures: Giorgian enriched the art in general, and gave greater brilliancy to his colours than his predecessors: Titian, by a careful imitation of nature, made great proficiency in the truth and perfection of his tones: Bartholomew de St Marc studied particularly the part of drapery, and discovered the claro obfcuro, the best manner of giving drapery to his figures, and of making the naked to be felt even where they were covered: Raphael, endowed with a superior genius, began with studying carefully all his predecessors and all his contemporaries. He united in himself all the excellencies which they possessed; and formed a style more perfect and more universal than any painter who went before or who has succeeded him. But while he excelled in every part of the art, he was chiefly superior in those of invention and of composition. It is probable that the Greeks themselves would have been filled with admiration if they had beheld his chief pieces in the Vatican, where the greatest abundance of paintings is joined to much perfection, and purity, and ease.\n\nAfter painting had arrived at the greatest perfection among the Greeks by the exertions of Zeuxis and Parrhasius, Apelles found nothing to add to the art except grace; in the same manner among the moderns, after Raphael had appeared, grace was the only thing wanting to the art, and Corregio became the Apelles of Europe. Painting was by him carried to the highest degree among the moderns; the taste of the best critics and the eye of the vulgar were equally gratified.\n\nAfter these great masters a considerable interval elapsed till the time of the Caracci. Those artists, born at Bologna, by studying the works of their predecessors with great care, and particularly those of Corregio, became the first and the most celebrated of their imitators. Hannibal possessed a very correct design, and united somewhat of the ancient style to that of Lewis his brother; but he neglected to inquire into the intricate principles and philosophy of the art. The pupils of the Caracci formed a school after their manner; but Guido, a painter of an easy and happy talent, formed a style altogether graceful, and rich, and easy. Guerifini formed after Caravaggio, or invented himself, a particular style of the claro-obfcuro, composed of strong shades and vivid proportions.\n\nPeter de Cortone succeeded those great imitators of his predecessors and of nature; who finding it difficult to succeed in that kind of painting, and having besides great natural abilities, applied himself chiefly to composition or arrangement, and to what the artists call tafte. He distinguished invention from composition; appeared not to have attended to the former, but chiefly to those parts which are most prominent in the picture, and to the contralting of groups. It was then that the practice was introduced of loading pictures with a great number of figures, without examining whether or not they agreed to the subject of the history. The ancient Greeks employed a very small number of figures in their works, in order to make the perfection of those which they admitted more evident. The disciples or imitators of Cortona, on the other hand, have sought to conceal their imperfections by multiplying their figures. This school of Cortona is divided into many branches, and has changed the character of the art. The multiplication of figures, without a judicious and proper choice, carried back the art of painting to that point where the first reformers of it among the moderns had left it; while at the same time the disciples of Cortona were enabled to give to this first condition of the art a greater degree of perfection than the first artists.\n\nAbout the middle of the 17th century flourished at Rome Carlo Maratti, who, aiming at the greatest perfection, carefully studied the works of the first painters, and particularly those of the school of the Caracci. Although he had already studied nature, he discovered by the works of these artists that it is not always proper to imitate her with a scrupulous exactness. This principle, which he extended to every part of the art, gave to his school a certain style of carefulness, which however is considerably degenerated.\n\nFrance has also produced great masters, particularly in the part of composition; in which Poussin, after Raphael, is the best imitator of the style of the ancient Greeks. Charles le Brun and many others distinguished themselves for great fertility of genius: and as long as the French school departed not from the principles of the Italian school, it produced matters of great merit in the different branches of the art.\n\nMengs, from whom this account is taken, is not deceived when he declares the art of painting to have degenerated in France after Le Brun; but he seems to be mistaken in giving the imitation of the works of Rubens found at Paris as the cause of this decay. It appears from this opinion, that the recent French school was not well known to him. The French, indeed, if we may believe their own authors, were never much occupied in the imitation of Rubens; and they have for a long time despised him. But the perfection of the dramatic art in France, the drefs of their actors, the magnificence and manners of the court, have contributed very much to the decay of painting.\npainting. Instead of forming their taste on the beautiful simplicity of nature, their painters studied the gestures and the attitudes of comedians, the topographies of women of fashion, the affected airs of courtiers, the pageantry of Versailles, and the magnificence of the opera. Mengs says, \"that the French have formed a national style, of which ingenuity and what they call spirit are the discriminating qualities; that they have ceased to introduce Greek, Egyptian, Roman, or barbarian personages into their paintings; and that after the example of Poussin, they content themselves with figures altogether French, as if it were their intention to hand down to posterity that such a nation once existed.\"\n\nSince, according to the confession of Mengs, their figures are altogether French, there is no reason to believe that the French painters have imitated Rubens, whose works are marked much more strongly than those of his master Æneas with the Flemish character. The truth is, that their painters, like Cortona and Maratti, have crowded their pictures with a great number of figures; have grouped them in a manner most calculated to strike the senses; have been more intent on agreeable artifices than expression and beauty; and, finally, that they have borrowed the manners of the court and theatre.\n\nThe first masters of the great schools of painting, with the ancients and nature for their guides, and their genius for their support, carried every part of the art to the greatest height of perfection. Those who followed them, and who had the example of their predecessors in addition to the first sources of truth and beauty, did by no means arrive at the same excellence. The Caracci in their school, Paul Veronese, and all the painters of his time, Vandyke, and all those who exercised the art in Italy, in Flanders, and in France, supported it with great brilliancy. But soon after the number of artists was multiplied; and lavishly copying men of inferior talents, they produced works of an inferior nature. Some wanting to be colourists, their pieces were exaggerated; others affecting simplicity, became cold and insipid. At this period of the art, men of real abilities, and covetous of fame, who wished to rise superior to the mediocrity of the times, seem not to have taken the road of truth and nature. They affected a style of pompous preparation, and annexed a kind of merit to the expert management of the pencil. The affected forms of Cortona and of his pupils, the fantastical attitudes and the poignant effects of Piazzetta, and in short the ingenious contrivances of the last masters of the French school, are decided proofs of this increasing bad taste.\n\nIt appears, that for some time past greater pains have been taken to form men for the art than to encourage those who possess the talent. In consequence of this ruinous practice, schools for drawing, very different from those formed by able painters, have been exceedingly multiplied; and these give the elements according to an uniform system, by which the mind is laid under a regular restraint at the very threshold of the profession. This evil is productive of two inconveniences; it gives middling painters, and it multiplies them to that degree, as to hasten the downfall and bring into contempt the art itself.\n\nThe particular reputation of the Italian painters furnishes another reason for the decline of the art. The first painters of that country were few in number; they were honoured, and they deserved to be honoured. Their distinguished reputation has conferred a value on the general paintings of their countrymen. The desire of possessing taste, or of being thought to possess it, had led the rich and the ignorant of all nations to give a preference to the Italian market. Necessarily, in this case, would multiply the painters; and their abilities must bear a pretty exact proportion to the discrimination of those who give the price.\n\nThe decline of painting has also arisen from the despotism which for some time reigned in the academic societies. In fact, these have often been ruled by men who would force every exertion of genius into their peculiar tract of operation. If they required such or such merit of execution, the first principles of the art were neglected for that peculiar excellency. In this manner the schools were absolute in behalf of design as long as ita- tuary was held in chief estimation. The artist, whose abilities and inclination led him to colouring, was obliged to abandon a pursuit which could be of no service to him, and devote himself to that for which he was not qualified by nature. On the other hand, if the instructions of the schools be confined to colouring, a mind disposed to the choice and exactness of forms will find no encouragement, and be forever lost to the art. In this manner the ignorance of those who wish to be connoisseurs, and the narrow views of those who pretend to direct the general taste, have equally contributed to the decline of the arts.\n\nSect. II. Of the Schools.\n\nA School, in the fine arts, denominates a class of artists who have learned their art from a certain master, either by receiving his instructions, or by studying his works; and who of consequence discover more or less of his manner, from the desire of imitation, or from the habit of adopting his principles.\n\nAll the painters which Europe has produced since the renovation of the arts are divided under the following schools: the school of Florence, the school of Rome, the school of Venice, the Lombard school, the French school, the German school, the Flemish school, the Dutch school, and the English school.\n\nThis school is remarkable for greatness; for attitudes of seemingly in motion; for a certain dark fervour; for an expression of strength, by which grace perhaps is excluded; and for a character of design approaching to the gigantic. The productions of this school may be considered as overcharged; but it cannot be denied that they possess an ideal majesty, which elevates human nature above mortality. The Tuscan artists, satisfied with commanding the admiration, seem to have considered the art of pleasing as beneath their notice.\n\nThis school has an indubitable title to the veneration of all the lovers of the arts, as the first in Italy which cultivated them.\n\nPainting, which had languished from the destruction of the Roman empire, was revived by Cinabue, born of a noble family in Florence in the year 1240. This painter translated the poor remains of the art from a Greek artist or two into his own country. His works, as may easily be imagined, were in a very ordinary style, but they received the applause and admiration of his fellow-citizens; and if Cinabue had not found admirers, Florence in all probability...\nprobability would not have been honoured with Michael Angelo. The number of painters became soon so considerable in Florence, that in the year 1350 they established a society under the protection of St Luke.\n\nMasolino, towards the beginning of the 15th century, gave more grandeur to his figures, adjusted their drapery better, and filled over them a kind of life and expression. He was surpassed by Masaccio his pupil; who first gave force, animation, and relievo to his works.\n\nAndrew Caffagna was the first Florentine who painted in oil. But Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo contemporary painters, were the glory of the school of Florence. Michael Angelo was superior to Leonardo in grandeur, in boldness of conception, and in knowledge of design; but Leonardo was superior to him in all the admirable parts of the art. Leonardo, possessed of a fine imagination, and full of sensibility, devoted himself in painting to express the affections of the soul; and if, in this sublime branch of the art, he was afterwards surpassed by Raphael, he had at least the glory not only of exceeding all the painters who went before him, but of pursuing a path which none of them had attempted. His design was pure and neat, and not wholly destitute of greatness. He never went beyond nature, and he made a good choice of objects for imitation.\n\nMichael Angelo, less formed to experience sweet affections than vehement passions, sought in nature what the strength of man might accomplish, not that which constitutes beauty. He delighted in being great and terrible, more than in graceful and pleasant attitudes. Well acquainted with anatomy, he knew more exactly than any other artist in what manner to express the jointing of the bones of the body, and the office and insertion of the muscles: but too eager to display his knowledge of anatomy, he seems to have forgotten that the muscles are softened by the skin which covers them; and that they are less visible in children, in women, and in young men, than in confirmed and vigorous manhood. \"In his figures (says Mengs) the articulations of the muscles are so easy and free, that they appear to be made for the attitude in which he represents them. The fleecy parts are too much rounded, and the muscles are in general too large, and of too equal strength. You never perceive in his figures a muscle at rest; and although he knew admirably well how to place them, their action is very frequently inconsistent with their situation.\"\n\n\"He did not possess (says Sir Joshua Reynolds) so many delightful parts of the art as Raphael; but those which he had acquired were of a more sublime nature. He saw in painting little more than what might be attained in sculpture; and he confined it to exactness of form and the expression of passions.\"\n\nHe informs us, in one of his letters, that he modelled in earth or wax all the figures which he intended to paint. This method was familiar to the great painters of his time, and ought never to be abandoned. It appears, that in representing them in this manner in relievo, the painter can imitate them much more exactly than when they are drawn with a crayon or pencil on a plain surface.\n\n\"Michael Angelo (continues Sir Joshua Reynolds) never attempted the lesser elegancies and graces in the art. Vasari says, he never painted but one picture in oil; and resolved never to paint another, saying it was an employment only fit for women and children.\n\n\"If any man had a right to look down upon the schools' lower accomplishments as beneath his attention, it was certainly Michael Angelo; nor can it be thought strange, that such a mind should have slighted, or have been withheld from paying due attention to all those graces and embellishments of art which have diffused such lustre over the works of other painters.\"\n\nAncient Rome, rich with the works brought from Greece, or finished in its own bosom by Grecian artists, handed down in its ruins the remains of that glory to which it had been elevated. It was by the study of these remains that the modern artists were formed: they derived from them the knowledge of design, the beauty of exquisite forms, greatness of style, and justness of expression, carried to that length only which did not affect the beauty of the figure. From them also, they derived the principles of the art of drapery; and they followed these principles even while they made the drapery of modern paintings more large and flowing than what was practised by the ancient sculptors. The Roman school was altogether devoted to the principal parts of the art, to those which require genius and vast conceptions; and was no farther occupied with colours than what was necessary to establish a difference between painting and sculpture, or rather between painting varied with colours and in chiaro-obscuro.\n\nRaphael Sanzio, born at Urbino in 1483, and scholar to Pietro Perugino, was the undoubted founder of this school. His first manner was that of Perugino his master; but he travelled twice to Florence to study the great artists who flourished in that city.\n\nIt was fortunate for Raphael, says Mengs, that he was born, in what he terms the infancy of the art, and that he formed himself by copying nature before he had access to see the works of any great master. He began by studying, with great exactness, the simple truth in his figures. He was then ignorant that any choice was necessary; but he saw the works of Leonardo da Vinci, of Masaccio, and of Michael Angelo, which gave his genius a new direction. After this he perceived that there was something more in the art of painting than a simple imitation of truth. But the works of those masters were not sufficiently perfect to point out the best choice to make; and he continued in uncertainty till he saw at Rome the works of the ancients. Then he perceived that he had found the true models which he wanted; and in imitating them he had only to follow the natural impulse of his genius.\n\nHabituated by his first manner to imitate nature with precision, it was not difficult to carry the same exactness into the imitation of the ancients; and it was a great advantage to him that he flourished in an age wherein the artists were not arrived at facility of execution at the expense of rigorous exactness. He never lost sight of nature; but he was instructed by the ancients in what manner she should be studied. He perceived, that the Greeks had not entered into minute details, that they had selected what was great or beautiful, and that one of the chief causes of the beauty of their works was the regularity of their proportions; he began, therefore, by carefully studying this part of the art. He saw also that the jointings of the bones, and the free play of their articulations, are the causes of all graceful movement; he there-\nfore, after the example of the ancients, gave the greatest attention to this part, and was led by these observations not to be contented with the simple imitation of nature.\n\nHis design is excellent, but neither so perfect nor so finished as that of the Greeks. He excelled in representing the character of philosophers, apostles, and other figures of that kind; but he did not equal the Greeks in ideal figures, which ought to carry the impression of divinity. His taste for design was more Roman than Greek, because he formed it chiefly on the bas-reliefs which he found at Rome. On this account he had the habit of marking strongly the bones and the articulations, and labouring the fleshly parts less; but as these ballo-reliefs are very exact with regard to the reciprocal proportions of every member, he excelled in this part, while at the same time he did not give to his figures all the elegance of the Greek artists, nor the flexibility of articulation which is admired in the Laocoön, in the Apollo of Belvidere, and in the Gladiator.\n\nThe manners and spirit of his age, and the subjects which he most commonly treated, prevented him from reaching the ideal of the ancients. Having seldom occasion to represent figures altogether ideal, he devoted himself to purity of expression. He knew that the expression of the passions of the soul is absolutely necessary in an art which represents the actions of men, since from those affections the actions may be said truly to originate. To make figures act, and yet neglect the interior springs of action, is nothing more than a representation of automata. The attitudes and action are evident; but they appear not to act of themselves, because they are void of those principles from which alone men are supposed to act. An artist who neglects expression, gives no just representation of character, even though he should take nature for his model.\n\nRaphael's first care, when he wanted to compose a piece, was to weigh the expression; that is to say, to establish, according to the nature of the subject, the passions which were to animate the characters. All the figures, all the accessories, all the parts of the composition, were moulded to the general expression.\n\nAs he had not found examples in the ancient statues of the claro-obscuro, he was comparatively weak in this part; and if there was any thing remarkable in his distribution of light and shade, he owed it to the works of the Florentine painters. It cannot be said, however, even with regard to the claro-obscuro, that he imitated nature without taste. He delighted in what are called masses of light; and disposed the great lights in the most conspicuous places of his figures, whether naked or in drapery. If this method did not produce effects highly illusive, it gives his works that distinctness which makes his figures conspicuous at a distance; and this must be allowed to be an essential part of the art of painting. He did not proceed beyond this; and content with that kind of claro-obscuro which comprehends imitation, he never attempted that which is ideal.\n\nThe composition and the ensemble of his figures were the chief excellencies of Raphael. His philosophical mind could not be affected with objects which had not expression. He had too high an idea of painting to consider it as a mute art; he made it speak to the heart and soul: and he could only do this in subjects which required expression. If Raphael did not reach the Greek excellence, if he did not possess the art of embellishing nature in the same high degree, he saw at least, and imitated her in whatever was expressive and beautiful. \"The Greeks failed with majesty (says Mengs) between earth and heaven: Raphael walked with propriety on the earth.\"\n\n\"Composition is in general (says the same author) of two kinds: Raphael's is the expressive kind; the other is the theatrical or picturesque, which consists of an agreeable disposition of the figures. Lanfranc was the inventor of this last, and after him Pietro de Cortona. I give the preference to Raphael; because reason presides over all his works, or at least the greatest part of them. He never allowed himself in common ideas, and was never allured to give anything in his accessory figures which might turn the attention from the principal object of the piece.\"\n\nA history of the schools is nothing more than a history of the painters who founded them. In those two which we have already given, Michael Angelo and Raphael come readily forward to claim our attention; and therefore we cannot do better than conclude the account by the masterly contrast of these eminent painters given by Sir Joshua Reynolds. \"If we put those great artists (says he) in a light of comparison with each other, Raphael had more taste and fancy, Michael Angelo more genius and imagination. The one excelled in beauty, the other in energy. Michael Angelo has more of the poetical in operation; his ideas are vast and sublime; his people are a superior order of beings; there is nothing about them, nothing in the air of their actions, or their attitudes, or the style and cast of their limbs or features, that puts one in mind of their belonging to our species. Raphael's imagination is not so elevated; his figures are not so much disjointed from our own diminutive race of beings, though his ideas are chaste, noble, and of great conformity to their subjects. Michael Angelo's works have a strong, peculiar, and marked character; they seem to proceed from his own mind entirely; and that mind so rich and abundant, that he never needed, or seemed to disdain, to look abroad for foreign help. Raphael's materials are generally borrowed, though the noble structure is his own. The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety, beauty, and majesty of his characters; his judicious contrivance of composition, correctness of drawing, purity of taste, and the faithful accommodation of other men's conceptions to his own purpose.\"\n\nThis school is the child of nature. The Venetian painters not having under their eyes like the Roman school, the remains of antiquity, were destitute of the means of forming a just idea of the beauty of forms and of expression. They copied without choice the forms of nature; but they were chiefly delighted with the beauties which presented themselves in the mixture and the variety of natural colours. Their attention not being detached from this part by anything of greater importance, colouring was their chief object, and they succeeded in it. They did not rest contented with characterizing the objects by comparison, in making the colour proper for one of more value by the\ncolour more proper for another; but they endeavoured still farther, by the agreement and opposition of the coloured objects, and by the contrast of light and shade, to produce a vigorous effect, to demand and fix the attention. Dominic, who was said to have perished at Florence by the jealousy of André Calagna, and who was the second Italian artist who painted in oil, had educated, before he quitted Venice, his native country, Jacques Bellin, who was remarkable for nothing but the picturesque education which he gave to Gentel and John his two sons.\n\nGentel, who was the eldest, painted chiefly in water colours. John contributed much to the progress of his art in painting constantly in oil, and after nature. Although he always retained great stiffness in his manner, he had less than his father or brother. Great neatness of colouring, and an approach to harmony, are evident in his works. His taste in design is Gothic, the air of his heads is sufficiently noble, his attitudes are without judgement, and his figures without expression. He had for scholars Giorgion and Titian, who deserve to be considered as the founders of the Venetian school.\n\nGiorgion distinguished himself by a design of a better taste than that of his master; but he chiefly surpassed him in colouring. He died in his 32nd year; and excited the emulation of Titian, who soon greatly excelled him.\n\nTiziano Vecelli, known best by the name of Titian, was instructed to copy nature in the most servile manner in the school of John Bellin; but when he had seen the works of Giorgion, he began to study the ideal in colouring.\n\nThe truth of history is not to be expected in his historical paintings, or in those of the artists of the same school. He seems to have paid little attention to the composition of scene, to the costume, to expression adapted to the subject, or, finally, to the accommodation of parts which characterize the works of those who have studied the ancients. He was in short a great painter and nothing more.\n\nBut although he deserves not to be placed among the most distinguished artists in point of judgement, yet he is by no means destitute of great and noble conceptions. There is often to be found among his male figures a considerable degree of grandeur; but if he has sometimes, like Michael Angelo, overcharged his design, it was more discovered in the swelling of the soft and fleshy parts than in vigour and muscular strength.\n\nAlmost entirely devoted to simple imitation, he had scarcely greater choice in the claro-obscuro than in design. He cannot be justly reproached at the same time for weakness in this particular; because in endeavouring to imitate the colours of nature, he was obliged to observe the degrees of light. And in proportion as he succeeded in the imitation of natural colours he must be less defective in the claro obscuro; but it is not in the knowledge of this part of the art that we are to seek for the beauties of his works. These are to be found in the happy dispositions of colours both proper and local, and he carries this to the highest point of perfection.\n\nThe artists in the Florentine and Roman schools painted most commonly in water colours or in fresco; and in the exercise of their profession, instead of nature, they finished their works from their first sketches. Titian painted in oil, and finished from the objects in nature; and this practice, joined to his exquisite talents, gave the greatest truth to his colours. His being a portrait painter was also of advantage to him as a colourist. In this department he was accustomed to the colours of nature in carnations and draperies. He was a landscape-painter, and here also he took the colours from nature.\n\n\"As Titian perceived (says Mengs) that the objects which are beautiful in nature have often a bad effect in painting, he found it necessary to make a choice in the objects of imitation; and he observed, that these were objects of which the local colours were extremely beautiful, which nevertheless were in a great measure destroyed by the reflection of light, by the porosity of the body, and by different luminous tints, &c. He perceived also, that in every object there was an infinite number of half tints, which conducted to the knowledge of harmony. In short, he observed in the objects of nature, a particular agreement of transparency, of opacity, of rudeness, and of polish, and that all objects differed in the degrees of their tints and their shades. It was in this diversity he sought the perfection of his art; and in the execution he moderated the effect of natural colours. For example, in a carnation which had many demi-tints, he confined himself to one; and he employed even less than a demi-tint, where there were few in the natural object. By this means he obtained a colouring exquisitely fine; and in this part he was a great master, and deserves to be carefully studied.\"\n\nTitian has in general little expression in his pictures, and he sometimes introduces figures which augment the coldness of the piece; for if it be true that the heads, even in historical painting, ought to be studied after nature, it is true also that an individual nature ought not to be presented, but one general and ideal. It is necessary that they should be men, while they resemble not men we are accustomed to see. The painter fails in the effect which he ought to produce, if, when he represents Achilles, Hector, and Caesar, his personages are familiar to our observation.\n\nThe colours of his paintings are so mingled together, as to give no idea of the colours on his pallet; which distinguishes him from Rubens, who placed his colours one at the side of another. It is impossible to say, on the narrowest inspection, with what colours he produced his tints. This practice, which enabled him to imitate so exactly the colours of nature, gives a marked distinction to his manner of painting. In the examination of his works, the critics lose an ordinary source of pleasure, which arises from marking the freedom of hand; but they may console themselves with the natural and exquisite touches of this artist.\n\nHe is of historical painters one of those who have succeeded in landscape. His situations are well chosen; his trees are varied in their forms, and their foliage well conceived. He had a custom of representing some remarkable appearance in his landscapes to render them more striking.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristics of this school are,\nAntonio Allegri, called Corregio, was the father and greatest ornament of this school. He began like the painters of his time to imitate nature alone; but, as he was chiefly delighted with the graceful, he was careful to purify his design from all short turnings and unnecessary angles. He perceived that largeness contributed to grace; and therefore he not only rejected all small figures, but enlarged as much as possible the outlines, avoided acute angles and straight lines, and by these means gave an easy grandeur to his design. He made his figures elegant and large; he varied the outlines by frequent undulations; but he was not always pure and correct.\n\nCorregio painted in oil, a kind of painting susceptible of the greatest delicacy and sweetness; and as his character led him to cultivate the agreeable, he gave a pleasing captivating tone to all his pictures. He sought transparent colours to represent shades conformable to nature, and adopted a manner of glazing which actually rendered his shadows more obscure. Obscurity in painting cannot be fully obtained without transparent colours; for these absorb the rays of light, and of consequence give less reflection. He laid his colours very thick on the brightest parts of his pictures, to make them capable of receiving, by a proper touch, the greatest degree of light. He perceived, that the reflections of light correspond with the colour of the body from which they are reflected; and on these principles he founded his theory of colours with respect to light and shade and reflection. But it is chiefly in the colour of his shades that he deserves to be imitated; for his lights are too clear, and somewhat heavy; and his fleshy parts are not sufficiently transparent.\n\nHarmony and grace are connected together; and on this account Corregio excelled also in harmony. As the delicacy of his taste suffered him not to employ strong oppositions, he naturally became a great master in this part, which chiefly consists of easy gradations from one extreme to another. He was harmonious in his design, by making the lines which formed the angles of the contour arched and undulated. But in the lights and shades, he placed always between the two extremes a space which served to unite them, and to form a passage from the one to the other. The delicacy of his organs made him perceive, better than any other artist, what relief was necessary to the eye after a violent exertion; and he was therefore careful to follow a bold and prevailing colour with a demi-tint, and to conduct the eye of the spectator, by an invisible gradation, to its ordinary state of tension. In the same manner (says Mengs) does agreeable and melting music pull one so gently out of sleep, that the waking resembles enchantment more than the disturbing of repose. A delicate taste in colours, a perfect knowledge of the claro obsuro, the art of uniting light to light, and shade to shade, together with that of detaching the objects from the ground, inimitable, grave, and perfect harmony, were the qualities which distinguished Corregio from all the painters, and placed him near the head of his profession.\n\nThe Caracci, Lewis, Augustin, and Hannibal, formed what is called the second Lombard school, which is frequently distinguished by the name of the school of Bologna.\n\nLewis was the master of the other two; he had studied the works of Titian and Paul Veronese at Venice, those of André del Sarte at Florence, those of Corregio at Parma, and those of Jules Romaeu at Mantua; but he chiefly endeavoured to imitate the manner of Corregio. Hannibal fluctuated between Corregio and Titian. Augustin their rival in painting had his mind cultivated by learning, and devoted part of his time to poetry and music, to dancing and to other manly exercises. These three painters often employed their talents on the same piece; and it was admirable that their united labours seemed to be animated with the same spirit.\n\nThey established an academy at Bologna, which their zeal for the advancement of their art made them call l'Accademia degli Delidrofi; but it was afterward called the Academy of the Caracci, because the reputation which these artists acquired, permitted not a more illustrious name to be given to an establishment of which they were the founders. In this school were taught the art of constructing models, perspective, and anatomy; lessons were given on the beautiful proportions of nature, on the best manner of using colours, and on the principles of light and shade. They held frequent conferences, in which not only artists, but men of general knowledge, were permitted to elucidate points relative to the art of painting; but they were separated upon Hannibal's going to Rome to adorn the gallery of the cardinal Farnese.\n\nThe works of the Caracci are often, from the resemblance of their manner, confounded together; especially those which were finished previous to the residence of Hannibal at Rome. Meanwhile each of them has a decided character distinct from the other two. Lewis had less fire, but more of gracefulness and grandeur; Augustin had more spirit in his conception, and more pleasantness in his execution; Hannibal is characterized by boldness, by a design more profound, by an expression more lucky, and by an execution more solid.\n\nSir Joshua Reynolds, who saw the works of Lewis at Bologna, holds him out in his discourses as the best model for what is called style in painting; which is the faculty of disposing colours in such a manner as to express our sentiments and ideas. \"Lodovico Caracci,\" says he, \"(I mean in his best works) appears to me to approach the nearest to perfection. His unaffected breadth of light and shadow, the simplicity of colouring, which, holding its proper rank, does not draw aside the least part of the attention from the subject, and the solemn effect of that twilight which seems diffused over his pictures, appears to me to correspond with grave and dignified subjects better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine which enlightens the pictures of Titian.\"\n\nHannibal is esteemed by the best judges as a model for beauty and design. Those who blame him for becoming less a colourist at Rome than he was at Bologna, ought to recollect that it is his performances at Rome which have chiefly secured his reputation. Severe critics have maintained that his design is too little varied in his figures; that he excels only in male beauty; that in imitating ancient statues, he excites some resemblance, but\nbut without arriving at the sublimity of ideas and of style which characterize the ancients; or, in other words, that he hath successfully imitated the exterior of their manner, but that he was incapable of reaching the interior and profound reasonings which determined those admirable artists.\n\nThe success of Hannibal, and the reputation which he acquired, have been pernicious to the art. His successors, deluded by these considerations, have made him the object of their imitation, without attending to the sources from which he derived his knowledge, and which he never could equal. The result has been, that, instead of becoming equal to Hannibal, they have often copied his imperfections.\n\nThis school has been so different under different masters, that it is difficult to characterize it. Some of its artists have been formed on the Florentine and Lombard manner, others on the Roman, others on the Venetian, and a few of them have distinguished themselves by a manner which may be called their own. In speaking in general terms of this school, it appears to have no peculiar character; and it can only be distinguished by its aptitude to imitate easily any impression; and it may be added, speaking still in general terms, that it unites, in a moderate degree, the different parts of the art, without excelling in any one of them.\n\nIt is equally difficult to determine the progress of painting in France. Miniature painting, and painting on glass, were early cultivated in that country; and in these two kinds, the Italians had often recourse to the French artists. When Francis I. encouraged Rosso a Florentine, and Primaticcio a Bolognian, the painters in France were not remarkable for any superior talent; but they were capable of working under these foreign artists.\n\nCousin, a painter on glass, and portrait-painter, was the first who established any kind of reputation in France. He was correct, but possessed very little elegance of design.\n\nPainting, for some time encouraged by Francis I., fell into a state of languor, from which it was not recovered till the reign of Louis XIII. Jacques Blanchard, formed at the Venetian school, and called the French Titian, flourished about this period. But as he died young, and without educating any pupils to perpetuate his manner, he must be regarded as a single good artist, and not as a founder of the French school.\n\nIn the same manner Poussin, one of the greatest French painters, and who is called the Raphael of France, educated no pupils, nor formed any school. His style and character of painting are described by Sir Joshua Reynolds as simple, careful, pure, and correct. No works of any modern (adds the same author) have so much of the air of antique painting as those of Poussin. His best performances have a remarkable dryness of manner, which, though by no means to be recommended for imitation, yet seems perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which distinguishes his style.\n\nIn the latter part of his life he changed from this manner to one much softer and richer; where there is a greater union between the figures and the ground. His favourite subjects were ancient fables; and no painter was ever better qualified to paint such objects, not only from his being eminently skilled in the knowledge of the ceremonies, customs, and habits of the ancients, but from his being so well acquainted with the different characters which those who invented them gave their allegorical figures.\n\nIf Poussin, in the imitation of the ancients, represents Apollo driving his chariot out of the sea by way of representing the sun rising, if he personifies lakes and rivers, it is no way offensive in him, but seems perfectly of a piece with the general air of the picture. On the contrary, if the figures which people his pictures had a modern air or countenance, if they appeared like our countrymen, if the draperies were like cloth or silk of our manufacture, if the landscape had the appearance of a modern view, how ridiculous would Apollo appear? Instead of the sun, an old man; or a nymph with an urn, instead of a river or a lake.\n\nPoussin, however, more admired than imitated, had no manner of influence in forming the French school. Simon Vouet, his enemy and persecutor, had this honour, because his pupils, in the happy age of the arts in France, conferred on it the highest splendour. Vouet was a man of distinguished abilities; but the school which he erected would have had no continuance if his scholars had pursued his manner of painting. He had a kind of grandeur and facility; but his design was false with regard to colours, and without any idea of expression. It was said of him, that he only needed to take the pencil in his hand to finish with one stroke the subject which he had conceived; and on this account one is tempted to be pleased, because he is astonished. He had the merit of destroying the inapt manner which reigned in France, and of pointing the way to a better taste.\n\nIf Vouet laid the foundation of the French school, Le Brun finished the edifice. When Le Brun was placed under the tuition of Vouet, he astonished his master and the rest of his pupils with the rapidity of his progress. At the age of 26 he finished his piece called the horae of Diomede, which gained a place in the palace royal (A), beside those of the most eminent painters. He was afterwards recommended to Poussin; but the young artist was more disposed by his natural inclinations to that modern part of the art which is called the great machine, than to the profound and studied manner of the Greek artists. Poussin at the same time was of great service to him, in recommending to his study the monuments, the customs, the dress of the ancients; their architecture, their rites, their spectacles, their exercises, their combats, and their triumphs.\n\nLe Brun had a noble conception and a fruitful imagination. He was on no occasion inferior to the vast compositions which he undertook, and he chiefly excelled in rigorous costume and exact likenesses.\n\nFew painters have united so great a number of essential\n\n(A) Where it may now be uncertain.

In drapery he followed the Roman school: the clothes which he gave to his figures were not like those of the Venetian school, of such and such a fluff; they were draperies and nothing more, and this manner agreed with the heroic style of his works; but in this part he was not equal to the painter of Urbino.—He had studied the expression of the affections of the soul, as is evident from his treatment on the character of the passions: but after observing the general characters, and establishing the principal strokes of expression, he thought he reached the whole extent of this subject, which is so infinitely extended. He always employed the few characters which he had once found out, and neglected to study the prodigious variety of gradations by which the interior affections are manifested in the exterior appearance. He fell then into the manner of repeating always and possessed neither the delicacy, nor the depth, nor the extreme justness, of Raphael's expression. He loved and possessed in a high degree the grand machine of the art; he was delighted with great compositions; and he gave them life, and animation, and variety; but he wanted the vigour and inspiration of Raphael. His compositions are formed on philosophical principles, but those of Raphael are created. Le Brun thought well; Raphael, Poussin, Le Sueur, thought most profoundly.—Le Brun had elevation, but he was not elevated like Raphael, to the sublime.\n\nIn colouring, Le Brun did not imitate the painters of the Venetian school. The sweet attractions and strong and solid colours of the schools of Rome and Lombardy seem rather to have been the object of his imitation; and from them also he learned an easy, agreeable, and bold management of the pencil.\n\nAs Le Brun possessed a great share of lively imagination, he delighted in allegory, which gives the greatest scope for ingenious invention. The fecundity and resources of his imagination appeared still farther, in his inventing symbols for his allegorical figures, without retailing contented with those employed by the ancients. But fanciful representations of this kind are distant from the operations of true genius. Spirit and thought in the arts are very different from spirit and thought in literary productions. A painter of moderate abilities may introduce into his works a great deal of the invention which belongs to poetry without enriching his peculiar art. The true spirit of painting consists in making the figures appear in the very circumstances and attitudes in which they are supposed to act, and penetrated with the sentiments with which they ought to be affected. By these means the spectator is more certainly interested than if the actions and thoughts were represented by allegorical symbols. Poussin appears to have less waste of spirit and imagination than Le Brun, while at the same time he gives more delight to people of spirit and imagination.\n\nEustach Le Sueur was the contemporary and rival of Le Brun; and no painter approached nearer to Raphael in the art of drapery, and in disposing the folds in the most artful and the noblest manner. His design was in general more slender than that of Raphael, but, like his, it was formed on the model of the ancients. Like Raphael he represented with art and precision the affections of the soul; like him, he varied the air of the head, according to the condition, the age, and the character of his personages; and, like him, he made the different parts of every figure contribute to the general effect. His intention in composing was to express his subject, not to make shining contrasts or beautiful groups of figures, not to astonish and bewitch the spectator by the deceitful pomp of a theatrical scene, or the splendor of the great machine. His tones are delicate, his tints harmonious, and his colours, though not so attractive as those of the schools of Venice and Flanders, are yet engaging. They lie peaceably on the soul, and fix it without distraction on the parts of the art, superior to that of colouring.\n\nHis preaching of St Paul, and the picture which he painted at St Gervais, which the critics compare with the best productions of the Roman school, and the 22 pictures which he painted for the Carthusian monastery at Paris, and which were formerly in possession of the king, are esteemed his best pieces. His contemporaries affirm, that he considered as sketches merely those excellent performances which are the glory of the French school.\n\nIf Le Sueur had lived longer, or if, like Le Brun, he had been employed under a court, fond of the arts, and of learning, to execute the great works of the age, the French school would have adopted a different and a better manner. The noble beauty of his heads, the simple majesty of his draperies, the lightness of his design, the propriety of his expression and attitudes, and the simplicity of his general disposition, would have formed the character of this school. The deceitful pomp of theatrical decoration would have been more lately introduced, or perhaps would never have appeared, and Paris might have been the counterpart to Rome. But as Le Brun, by an accidental concurrence of favourable circumstances, was the fashionable painter, to be employed or rewarded it was necessary to imitate his manner; and as his imitators possessed not his genius, his faults became not only current but more deformed.\n\nThe French school not long ago changed its principles; and if, when peace shall be restored to this unhappy nation, they continue to follow the road which, while the artists flourished among them, they marked out for themselves, they have the chance of becoming the most rigid observers of the laws imposed on the Greek artists. The count de Caylus, pupil of Bouchardon, who by his rank and fortune had the means of encouraging the imitators of the ancients, and of the masters of the 15th century, first formed the design of restoring a pure taste to the art of painting. He was founded by the talents of M. Vien, an artist who had only occasion to have his lessons and his example laid before him.—In this manner commenced a revolution, so much the more wonderful, as it was scarcely ever known that any nation substituted a system of simple and rigid excellence in place of a false and glittering taste. The history of all nations, on the contrary, discovers a gradual progress from a rude beginning to perfection, and afterwards to irremediable decay. The French had the prospect of stopping short in this ordinary course. They begin...\nbegan in a manner which promised success; and the best consequences may be expected, from being in possession of those precious treasures of sculpture and painting of which they plundered the countries subdued by their arms.\n\nIn Germany there can hardly be said to be a school, as it is a continuation of single artists, who derived their manner from different sources of originality and imitation. There were some German painters of eminence, when the art, emerging from its barbarous state, first began to be cultivated with success in Europe. As they were totally unacquainted with the ancients, and had scarcely access to the works of their contemporaries in Italy, they copied nature alone, with the exception of somewhat of that stiffness which forms the Gothic manner. It is this manner, if we speak of the early German painters, which characterizes their school. But this is by no means the case with their successors, part of whom were educated in Flanders and part in Italy: For if Mengs or Dietrich were comprehended in this school, there would be nothing peculiar to its manner discovered in their works. And it is therefore necessary to confine our observations to the more ancient German painters, in whom the Gothic style is conspicuous.\n\nAlbert Durer was the first German who corrected the bad taste of his countrymen. He excelled in engraving as well as painting. His genius was fertile, his compositions varied, his thoughts ingenious, and his colours brilliant. His works, though numerous, were finished with great exactness; but as he owed everything to his genius, and as works of inferior merit were by the false taste of the times preferred to his, it was impossible for him altogether to avoid the faults of his predecessors. He is blamed for stiffness and aridity in his outlines, for little taste or grandeur in his expression, for ignorance of the costume of aerial perspective and of gradation of colours; but he had carefully studied lineal perspective, architecture, and fortification.\n\nJohn Holbein or Holbein, nearly contemporary with Albert Durer, painted in oil and water colours. He excelled chiefly in history and in portrait painting. His colours are fresh and brilliant, and his works are highly finished; but in his historical subjects, his draperies are not in so good a taste as those of Albert Durer.\n\nThe Flemish school is recommended to the lovers of the art by the discovery, or at least the first practice, of oil painting. Van Mander gives us the account of this wonderful discovery in the following words: \"John Van Eyck was so excellent a chemist, that he discovered a method of varnishing his distemper colours with a varnish, which was made of some oils, and was very pleasing on account of the gloss and lustre it gave them. Many artists in Italy had vainly attempted to find out that secret; they never hit on the true method. It happened once that John, in his usual manner, having highly finished one of his pictures on boards, and having varnished it with his new invented varnish, exposed it to dry in the sun; but whether the boards were not well joined, or whether the heat of the sun was too violent, the boards split asunder and opened in the junctures. John saw with concern that his work was spoiled, and resolved to contrive something against future accidents of the same kind. Being disgusted at distemper painting and varnishing, he thought of a varnish that might dry without sunshine; and having tried many oils and substances, he found that linseed and nut oil dried better than any other. He boiled them with some other drugs, and produced the best varnish in the world. Ever bent on improvements, he found, after much inquiry, that colours mixed with these oils worked and dried extremely well, and when dried would be water-proof. He observed likewise, that these oils would animate and give them a gloss and lustre without any farther varnishing.\" The truth, however, of this account is now very much questioned; and it is even proved by the manuscripts of Theophilus Presbyter, and also by some old paintings in England, that this method of painting was discovered long before the time of John Van Eyck. At the same time we admit, that John and his brother Hubert may have been the first who brought oil painting into general practice, not only by showing the excellence of which it was susceptible, but also by making several improvements on the art. And this is the more probable, from the great reputation which their pictures acquired over all Europe, by the softness and delicacy of their colours. The attention of the Italian painters was chiefly excited, inasmuch that Antoine de Medina performed a journey into Flanders for the express purpose of acquiring the confidence of John Van Eyck, and of discovering the secret.\n\nJohn de Bruges was the founder of painting as a profession in Flanders; Peter Paul Rubens was the founder of the art. This extraordinary person produced an immense number of works. He excelled equally in historical, portrait, and landscape painting; in fruits, flowers, and in animals. He both invented and executed with the greatest facility; and to show the extent of his powers, he frequently made a great number of sketches on the same subject altogether different, without allowing any time to elapse between them. The works of Rubens were destitute of that soft inspiration, productive of sweet and pleasant effects, so conspicuous in the works of Raphael; but he possessed that sprightliness of genius and strength of mind which is ever ready to burst forth in wonderful and astonishing effects. His figures appear to be the exact counterpart of his conceptions, and their creation nothing more than a simple act of the will.\n\nHis talent for design is unjustly censured, for on every occasion his design is noble and easy. He had great knowledge of anatomy, but he was hurried away by the impetuosity of his imagination and the ardour for execution; he preferred splendor to the beauty of forms, and sacrificed correctness of design too often to the magic of colours. In short, his qualities suppose a mind full of fire and vigour, rather than accuracy or profound thought. His drapery may be considered rather as fine than properly adapted to his figures; for, in the language of the art, to clothe and to give drapery are not synonymous terms. A portrait painter may excel in clothing his personages, while he is totally incapable of giving good drapery to a historical painting. His chief merit consists in colouring; though in this branch of the art he has not equalled Titian. He is the first among painters eminent for pomp and majesty; the first among those who speak to the eye, and the power of the art is often carried by him almost to enchantment.\n\nIt is evident from the works of Rubens, that his method of painting was to lay the colours in their place, one at the side of another, and mix them afterwards by\na flight touch of the pencil. Titian mingled his tints as they are in nature, in such a manner as to make it impossible to discover where they began or terminated; the effect is evident, the labour is concealed. Thus Rubens is more dazzling, and Titian more harmonious. In this part, the first excites the attention, the second fixes it. The carnations of Titian resemble the blush of nature; those of Rubens are brilliant and polished like satin, and sometimes their tints are so strong and separated as to appear like spots.\n\n\"Rubens (says Sir Joshua Reynolds) is a remarkable instance of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the art. The whole is so much of a piece, that one can scarce be brought to believe but that if any one of them had been more correct and perfect, his works would not be so complete as they appear. If we should allow a greater purity and correctness of drawing, his want of simplicity in composition, colouring, and drapery, would appear more gross.\"\n\nIn his composition his art is too apparent. His figures have expression, and act with energy, but without simplicity or dignity. His colouring, in which he is eminently skilled, is notwithstanding too much of what we call tinted. Throughout the whole of his works there is a proportionate want of that nicety of distinction and elegance of mind, which is required in the higher walks of painting; and to this want it may be in some degree ascribed, that those qualities which make the excellency of this subordinate style appear in him with their greatest lustre.—Indeed the facility with which he invented, the richness of his composition, the luxuriant harmony and brilliancy of his colouring, so dazzle the eye, that, whilst his works continue before us, we cannot help thinking that all his deficiencies are fully supplied.\n\nThe Flemish school, of which Rubens is the greatest master, is remarkable for great brilliancy of colours and the magic of the claro-obscuro. To these may be joined a profound design, which is yet not founded on the most beautiful forms; a composition possessed of grandeur, a certain air of nobleness in the figures, strong and natural expressions; in short, a kind of national beauty, which is neither copied from the ancients nor from the Roman nor Lombard schools, but which deserves to please, and is capable of pleasing.\n\nTo speak in general terms, and without regarding a great number of exceptions, the Dutch school carries none of the above qualities to great perfection, except that of colouring. Far from excelling in the beauty of heads and forms, they seem chiefly to delight in the exact imitation of the lowest and most ignoble. Their subjects are derived from the tavern, the smith's shop, and from the vulgar amusements of the rudest peasants. The expressions are sufficiently marked; but it is the expression of passions which debase instead of ennobling human nature. One would think that they practised the art of degrading the bodies and souls of men.\n\nIt must be acknowledged, at the same time, that the Dutch painters have succeeded in several branches of the art. If they have chosen low objects of imitation, they have represented them with great exactness; and truth must always please. If they have not succeeded in the most difficult parts of the claro-obscuro, they at least excel in the most striking, such as in light confined in a narrow space, night illuminated by the moon or by torches, and the light of a smith's forge. The Dutch understand the gradations of colours; and by their knowledge of contrast they have arrived at the art of painting light itself. They have no rivals in landscape painting, considered as the faithful representation or picture of a particular scene; but they are far from equalling Titian, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, &c., who have carried to the greatest perfection the ideal landscape, and whole pictures, instead of being the topographical representation of certain places, are the combined result of everything beautiful in their imagination or in nature. The Dutch, however, distinguish themselves by their perspective, by their clouds, sea scenes, animals, fruits, flowers, and insects; and they excel in miniature painting. In short, every thing which requires a faithful imitation, colour, and a nice pencil, is well executed by the Dutch painters.\n\nHolland has also produced history painters, as Octavius Van Been, and Vander Hilst the rival of Van Dyke, and perhaps his superior: but it is not in the works of those artists that we find the character of the Dutch school.\n\nNeither is the origin of their style to be derived from the works of Lucas of Leyden, though, from the time he flourished, viz. about the end of the 15th century, he may be considered as the patriarch of the Dutch school. Lucas painted in oil, in water colours, and on glass; and the kinds of his painting were history, landscape, and portrait. His picture of the Last Judgement is preserved in the Hotel-de-Ville of Leyden; it possesses vast merit in point of composition, and a great variety of figures.\n\nIf miniature painting be considered as a characteristic of the Dutch school, Cornelius Polembourg may be regarded as the father of it. He possessed the colour, delicacy of touch, and disposition of the claro-obscuro, which chiefly distinguished this school; and if any thing is to be added, it is want of correctness in his design.\n\nBut if the choice of low figures is its chief characteristic, this is to be found in the greatest perfection in the works of the celebrated Rembrandt Vanryn; and it is the more offensive in this artist, as his compositions frequently required an opposite choice of figures. As his father was a miller near Leyden, his education must altogether have depended on the exertion of great talents and the study of nature. He studied the grotesque figure of a Dutch peasant or the servant of an inn with as much application as the greatest masters of Italy would have studied the Apollo of Belvidere or the Venus de Medicis. This was not the manner of elevating himself to the noble conceptions of Raphael; but it was acquiring the imitation of truth in vulgar painting.\n\n\"Rembrandt (says M. Defcamps) may be compared to the great artists for colour and delicacy of touch and claro-obscuro. It appears that he would have discovered the art, though he had been the first person that ever attempted it. He formed to himself rules and a method of colouring, together with the mixture of colours and the effect of the different tones. He delighted in the great oppositions of light and shade; and he seems to have been chiefly attentive to this branch of the art. His workshop was occasionally made dark, and he received the light by a hole, which fell as he chose to direct it...\"\non the place which he desired to be enlightened. On particular occasions he passed behind his model a piece of cloth of the same colour with the ground he wanted; and this piece of cloth receiving the same ray which enlightened the head, marked the difference in a sensible manner, and allowed the painter the power of augmenting it according to his principles.\n\n\"Rembrandt's manner of painting is a kind of magic. No artist knew better the effects of different colours mingled together, nor could better distinguish those which did not agree from those which did. He placed every tone in its place with so much exactness and harmony, that he needed not to mix them, and so destroy what may be called the flower and freshness of the colours. He made the first draught of his pictures with great precision, and with a mixture of colours altogether particular: he proceeded on his first sketch with a vigorous application, and sometimes loaded his lights with so great a quantity of colour, that he seemed to model rather than to paint. One of his heads is said to have a nose nearly as much projected as the natural nose which he copied.\"\n\nSuch is the power of genius, that Rembrandt, with all his faults, and they are enormous, is placed among the greatest artists by M. Defamps, who saw his works, and was himself an artist. It is necessary to observe, that if Rembrandt was ignorant of the essential parts of his art, or neglected them, he was yet acquainted with expression, which alone was capable of giving animation to his works. His expressions are not noble, but they are just, lively, and excited with great judgement.\n\nJohn de Laer, a miniature painter, and who made choice of his subjects from common life, deserves a distinguished place in the Dutch school. He painted hunting-scenes, the attacks of robbers, public festivals, landscapes, and sea-views; and he ornamented his pictures with old ruins, and enriched them with figures of men and animals. He had a correct design, and employed vigorous and lively colouring.\n\nVan Ostadde, although born at Lubeck, Gerard Dow, Metzu, Miris, Wouvermans, Berghem, and the celebrated painter of flowers Van Huyfum, belong to the Dutch school.\n\nThe greater part of the schools of which we have treated have no longer any existence. Italy alone had four schools, and there only remain at present a very few Italian artists known to foreigners. The school of Rubens is in vain sought for in Flanders. If the Dutch school still exists, it is not known beyond the precincts of Holland. Mengs a German artist has made himself famous in our days; but it was in Italy that he chiefly improved his talents and exercised his art. M. Dietrich, another German, has made himself known to strangers: but two solitary artists do not form a school.\n\nA new school is formed in our times and in our own country, called the English school. It is connected with the academy in London, instituted in 1766 by letters patent from the king, and formed only in 1769. Sir Joshua Reynolds is the undoubted founder of it. His works give him a distinguished rank among the artists of the present age, and exhibit a genius in their author which has seldom been surpassed: but the effects which he has contrived to give to them by the formation of a new school, and by the good principles which his discourses to academicians, and his example as a painter, have disseminated, will secure his reputation as long as England shall esteem the advantages and the worth of great abilities. The English taste appears to be formed on the great masters of the Italian and the Flemish schools. Sir Joshua was a great admirer of Michael Angelo, and particularly recommends him to the attention of the academicians. \"I feel (says Sir Joshua), a self-congratulation in knowing myself capable of such sensations as he intended to excite. I reflect, notwithstanding vanity, that these discourses bear testimony of my admiration of that truly divine man; and I should declare that the last words which I should pronounce in this academy, and from this place, might be the name of—Michael Angelo.\" But though he thus enthusiastically admired this very great man, yet he allows, what cannot indeed be denied, that he was capricious in his inventions: \"and this (says he) may make some circumpection necessary in studying his works; for though they appear to become him, an imitation of them is always dangerous, and will prove sometimes ridiculous. 'In that dread circle none durst tread but he.' To me, I confess, his caprice does not lower the estimation of his genius, even though it is sometimes, I acknowledge, carried to the extreme: and however those eccentric excursions are considered, we must at the same time recollect, that those faults, if they are faults, are such as never could occur to a mean and vulgar mind; that they flowed from the same source which produced his greatest beauties; and were therefore such as none but himself was capable of committing; they were the powerful impulses of a mind united to subjection of any kind, and too high to be controverted by cold criticism.\"\n\nThe effect of Sir Joshua's discourses is visible in the pictures of this school. The Death of General Wolfe, the Departure of Regulus for Carthage, the Arrival of Agrippina, and some other subjects, are decided proofs that the English school is acquainted with greatness of style, boldness of expression, and the art of managing a great number of figures. It will be fortunate for the painters of this school, if, more rigid with regard to their forms than ambitious of poignant and astonishing effects, they support the character which they have already acquired. But although England had not enjoyed this brilliant success in painting, she would have immortalized herself by the excellency of her engravings.\n\nIt is easy to perceive in all those schools the cause of the character which distinguishes them. In the Roman school, it is the excellent education of its first masters, together with the precious remains of antiquity found in the ruins of ancient Rome. In the Venetian school, the magnificence derived from the commerce of the east, the frequency of feasts and masquerades, and the necessity of painting to the rich and luxurious, who were accustomed to behold these magnificent objects, were the causes of its gay and taffy. In the Dutch school, the peculiarity of its grovelling manner may be accounted for from the habits of the artists. Accustomed to visit taverns and workshops, and having most commonly exposed to their view low\nSchools. low and grotesque figures, they represent in their pictures the objects which were most familiar to them in life.\n\n\"Beauty (says a French writer *) ought to be the characteristic of the English school, because the artists have it often exposed to their view. If this beauty is not precisely similar to that among the ancients, it is not inferior to it. The English school should also distinguish itself for truth of expression; because the liberty enjoyed in that country gives to every passion its natural and unbiased operation. It will probably long preserve its simplicity unpolluted by the pomp of theatrical taste and the conceit of false graces, because the English manners will long preserve their simplicity.\n\nExamine the picture of a Frenchwoman (continues he) painted by an artist of that nation, and you will generally find, in place of expression, a forced grin, in which the eyes and the forehead do not partake, and which indicates no affection of the soul. Examine the picture of an Englishwoman done by one of their painters, and you observe an elegant and simple expression, which makes you at once acquainted with the character of the person represented.\"\n\nSect. III. Comparison between the Ancient and Modern Painting.\n\nNo person of judgement or taste hesitates to give the superiority to the ancient sculpture; but the moderns comfort themselves with refusing the same superiority to the Greek artists in the art of painting. The small number of their productions which remain, and the probable conjectures which may be formed concerning those which have perished, go the length to prove that the Greek painters conducted themselves on other principles than those which have received the sanction of custom and the force of laws in our schools. But this censure might be applied with equal justice to Homer as an epic poet, and to Sophocles and Euripides as writers of tragedy.\n\nThe principal difference between the ancient and modern manner of painting consists in the complication of figures, and the pompous decoration of scenery which prevails in the modern, when compared with the unity and simplicity of the ancient painters. This simplicity, however, does not seem to arise from the want of capacity, but from a choice, as Polygnotus, one of their most ancient painters, represents in one of his pieces the siege of Troy, and in another the descent of Ulysses into hell; but they soon decided in favour of simplicity, and their pieces generally contain one or two figures, and very rarely more than three or four.\n\nPoetry in this particular is conducted on very different principles. A poet may with great propriety multiply his characters, and enter into details of a variety of actions, because the whole of his characters and actions do not occupy the mind of his reader at the same time. The whole of his art consists in making one naturally succeed another; but every part of the poem which contains a separate transaction would make a picture capable of fixing the attention. In painting, the eye takes in the whole; and it is by no means satisfied if 20 or 30 figures are presented to it, which it cannot possibly comprehend. It is in vain to group the figures, or to call the attention to the principal object by a greater degree of light; the spectator is anxious to examine every object which is presented to him; and if they are not to be examined, for what reason are they painted? An excellent piece, at the same time, consisting of a great number of figures, will give pleasure; but it is accompanied with that fatigue which one experiences when he runs over a gallery furnished with a great variety of excellent pictures.\n\nThose observations on the attention of the spectator led the Greeks to make similar ones on the attention of the artist. They perhaps thought that the painter who had to execute a great variety of figures in the same work, could not study each of them with equal accuracy and care; and of consequence that he might produce something altonting in the extent, and yet disfiguring in the detail.\n\nThis difference, however, between ancient and modern painting, cannot give any decided principle to determine on their comparative merit. We are accustomed to behold assemblages in nature; and it is a fact, that even in affecting scenes a great number of figures may not only be brought together, but that they may heighten the distress. It is supposing a picture to have little effect, to imagine that we can coolly, and with the same kind of attention, examine the principal and the accessory figures. If it is highly finished, our whole soul must be absorbed in that object which the artist intended to be most conspicuous; and if we give any attention to the surrounding figures, we shall consider them as spectators of the same scene, and derive from them an addition of sympathy and of feeling. The whole question in this particular point of view amounts to this, that the moderns have chosen a more difficult part; and if they have executed it with success, their merit is greater. And this observation will hold good, unless it can be proved that it is utterly impossible to make an assemblage of figures lead to one general and common effect.\n\nThe proper manner of deciding the comparative merit of the ancients and moderns, is to consider, as far as we have sufficient data to go upon, to what degree the ancients excelled in the particular departments of this art. There are two sources from which we can derive information; namely, from the morsels of antiquity which yet remain, and from what the ancient writers have said on the subject of painting, both of which are extremely defective. It is allowed, however, by every skilful person who has viewed the remains of ancient paintings, that none of them appear to be the performances of superior artists, notwithstanding much merit in the design and accuracy in the drawing, which indeed seems to have been habitual to almost every ancient artist. The best among these paintings (according to Sir Joshua Reynolds), \"the supposed marriage in the Aldrobanine palace,\" is evidently far short of that degree of excellence undoubtedly implied in the descriptions of ancient authors, and which from them we are fairly led to expect.\n\nStill more defective, if possible, is this last species of evidence: for we have no direct treatise remaining on the subject by any of the ancients, although many were composed by their artists. The passages from which we\nare to decide are, either the cursory remarks of writers not expressly treating on the subject of painting, or the descriptions of those who at best can rank but as amateurs of a fashionable art. From these indeed we may pretty safely assert the degree of excellence which the passages imply; but we should reason very inconclusively, were we to deny them any higher or any other merit than appears to be strictly contained in these scattered observations. Let any one for a moment place the modern painters in his mind in the same situation as the ancients, and he will quickly decide on the truth of these remarks.\n\nNevertheless, it is necessary on this subject to derive some conclusions from the information which is occasionally given in ancient authors. That the ancients paid a particular attention to design, would be evident from the manner in which they speak of this department of the graphic art, even though the moderns were not in possession of such remaining proofs of their excellence herein (though by artists of an inferior class), as to place this point beyond the reach of doubt.\n\nIndeed, when it is considered that, with respect to freedom and correctness of outline, painting and sculpture are very nearly connected; that Phidias and Apelles were nearly contemporaries; that many of the ancient painters, such as Zeuxis, Protogenes, Apelles, &c., were accustomed to modelling for the purpose of sculpture or of calling; that the extreme elegance of design in the ancient statues is so notorious as to be the acknowledged model even for modern artists; and that these ornaments of sculpture were well known and universally admired among the ancients—we shall have little hesitation in admitting their equality with the moderns so far as design is concerned. But should any doubt remain on this point, the drawings from the antiquities of Herculaneum will be striking proofs that truth, elegance, and spirit, in a degree rarely to be met with among the moderns, were habitual even to the common run of artists in the declining age of ancient painting.\n\nThe ancients excelled moreover not merely in the common and obvious parts of design; but they appear to have had no inconsiderable degree of skill in the art of foreshortening. The performance of Pautanias is a proof of this: *Fecit autem grandes tabulas facit spectaculum in Pompeii porticus bomin immolationem.* Eam enim picturam primum invenerunt, quam poetae imitati sunt multi, equavit nemo. Ante omnia, cum longitudinem bovis offendere velit, adverfum eum pincet, non tranferfum, et abundè intelligatur amplitude. Dein cum omnes qui volunt eminentia videre, candicantia faciant, coloremque condant, hic totum bovem atri coloris fecit; umbraeque corpus ex ipso dedi; magna proflus arte in aqua extantia offendens et in confracto folida omnia.*\n\nNor will it be difficult to show, that the ancient painters were not inferior to the moderns in expression. The state of sculpture alone among the ancients would almost furnish a decisive proof that the finer art of painting could not be deficient. Among the ancient statues which yet remain, expression is carried to a wonderful height; not merely the features of the face, but almost every muscle of the body, combining to enforce the idea intended to be conveyed.\n\nMr Webb* very properly observes, that \"the ancients thought characters and manners so essential to painting, that they expressly term painting an art descriptive of manners. Aristotle in his Poetics says of Polygnotus, that he was a painter of the manners; and objects to Zeuxis, his weakness in this part.\" We have in Philostratus the following description of a picture: \"We may instantly (says he) distinguish Ulysses by his severity and vigilance; Menelaus by his mildness; and Agamemnon by a kind of divine majesty. In the son of Tydeus is expressed an air of freedom; Ajax is known by his fullness of countenance; and Antilochus by his alacrity. To give to these such sentiments and actions is consequential from their peculiar characters, is the ethic of painting.\"\n\nAnother instance of excellence in expression among the ancient paintings was the Medea of Timonachus. She was painted about to kill her infants. Aufionius speaks with admiration of the mingled expression of anger and maternal fondness in her face and manner.\n\n*Immanem exhaust verum in diversa laborem\nFingeret affection matris ut ambiguum,\nIra fub eff lachrymis, miserabilis non caret ira,\nAltere uirum vedens ut fit in altere uiro.*\n\nIt may not be amiss, however at this period of our inquiry, to make some observations on the testimonies of ancient authors respecting this subject.\n\nIt is certainly true, that when the works of an ancient artist are praised for any real or supposed merit, the commendations will be relative to the degree of perfection to which the art had arisen at the time, and to the opportunities of information, the taste, and judgment of the person who beholds them. Excellence will always be attributed to him who leaves his contemporaries far behind; and those performances will often be considered as supremely beautiful which exceed in beauty all that have gone before.\n\nIn like manner, a person of natural sensibility, but who has been accustomed all his life to performances of an inferior stamp, will be in raptures at any which much exceed the best he has heretofore been taught to admire; and whatever opportunities of information he may have, his evidence will not be of much weight, if he do not possess a sufficient degree of taste and judgment to use them properly.\n\nIn ascertaining therefore the degree of credit due to the praises bestowed on any performance in a branch of the fine arts, we must take into consideration the general state of the art at the time, and the competence of the person who bestows the praise.\n\nNo flight degree of probability, however, may be attained on both these points, by attending to a circumstance not generally noticed, viz. that in an advanced state of the art, and when the observer is acquainted with his subject, the praise will seldom be given in loose, general, and comprehensive expressions; but the terms in which it is conveyed will be characteristic and determinate, and often technical; they will frequently show the state of the art, by marking the subdivisions and the skill of the observer by judicious discrimination. When, added to these, the latter can refer for comparison to any existent standard of perfection, his praise may fairly be adopted in its full extent, and regarded as evidence upon the point in question.\n\nTo apply these observations to painting, it is clear,\nwith respect to the most difficult, the most fundamental, and the highest in rank among the departments of the art, viz. design and expression, that the ancients were fully equal to the moderns; and their expressions of praise must be allowed to imply an equal degree of absolute skill, with similar expressions, if applied to the great masters of modern art. It is also clear that painting was extremely cultivated among the ancients, and that their good painters were more esteemed than artists of equal merit in modern times; that what we should term gentlemen artists were frequent with them (apud Romanos quoque honos naturè lucid arti contigit); and that the expressions of the ancient connoisseurs evince much theoretical and technical knowledge of the art, and display a distribution of its parts almost as minute, complete, and scientific, as the present state of it can boast.\n\nWith regard to colouring, the praises of the ancient authors chiefly relate to the style of it as exerted upon single figures or particular tints. It may therefore be doubted whether the ancients were possessed of the art of distributing their colours through the whole of a picture, so as to produce an harmony and general tone of colouring similar to that which we admire in the Lombard and Flemish schools. The present remains of ancient paintings do not appear to warrant any such conclusion; but being undoubtedly the works of inferior hands, their authority is very small when alleged against the general or particular merit of the ancient artists. The following extracts will be sufficient to evince, that the ancients did attend to this technical branch of colouring.\n\nIndeed the modern technical expressions appear borrowed from the following passage of Pliny, which may be regarded as decisive on the subject. Tandem sefatars infa diffimunt, et inventi lumen atque umbras, differentia colorum alterna vice sefi excitante. Dein adjecta ef. flendor; alias his quam lumen; quem quia inter hoc et umbram effet appellaverunt tonon. Commissuras vero colorum et transitus, harmogen. The lumen atque umbras of this passage might have been regarded as merely descriptive of the light and shade necessary to relieve single figures, if it were not for the subsequent definition of tone. The harmogen of Pliny means the handling or skilful blending and softening colours into one another, rather than what we now call harmony.\n\nLucian *, in his fine description of that spirited painting by Zeuxis of the male and female centaurs, after relating the treatment of the subject itself, proceeds to notice the technical execution of the picture; and he praises particularly the truth and delicacy of the drawing, the perfect blending of the colours, the skilful shading, the scientific preservation of size and magnitude, and the equality and harmony of the proportions throughout the whole piece.\n\nPainters, says Plutarch, increase the effect of the light and splendid parts of a picture by the neighbourhood of dark tints and shades. And Maximus Tyrius observes, that bright and vivid colours are always pleasant to the eye; but this pleasure is always lessened if you omit to accompany them with somewhat dark and gloomy. These passages seem to imply a knowledge of the use of cold and dark tints even where a brilliancy of tone is required. The best among the ancient painters, however, seem to have preferred a chaste and sober style of colouring to the gaudiness and flutter of the later artists.\n\nUpon the whole, therefore, with respect to colouring as employed upon single figures, as the ancients were fully as competent to judge of excellence herein as the moderns; as the expressions of the ancient connoisseurs are very warm in praise of the colouring of many of their painters; as they appear also to have attended very much to the art of colouring; and, moreover, as probable evidence can be adduced that they attended to miniature painting—a considerable degree of merit may be allowed them in the use of the colours they possessed.\n\nChiaro-oscuro, or the art of placing and proportioning light and shade in such a manner as to produce a pleasing effect, independently of any other circumstance connected with the picture, has been commonly deemed a characteristic difference between the knowledge of ancient and modern painters. On this subject the works of the ancients now remaining give little or no information; hence Sir Joshua Reynolds observes, \"that this, which makes so considerable a part of the modern art, was to them totally unknown. If the great painters had possessed this excellence, some portion of it would have infallibly been diffused, and have been discovered, in the works of the inferior ranks of artists which have come down to us, and which may be considered as on the same rank with the paintings that ornament our public gardens.\" But the accounts of the places where these paintings have been found, make it evident that they were thus ornamented at a very considerable expense. The generality of them consist of single figures; some of them of two or three figures, generally relieved by an uniform ground; and, except in a few instances, evidently designed as mere reliefs to a compartment, and answering, as near as may be, to the flounced ornaments in our modern rooms; nor do any of them seem the works of artists equal in their day to those at present employed on the painted ceilings of private houses.\n\nThe Abbé du Bos maintains, on the other hand, that what Pliny and other ancient writers lay concerning the chiaro-oscuro and the delightful distribution of light and shade, is altogether decisive; and that their writings are full of so many probable circumstances, that it cannot be denied that the ancients at least equalled the most celebrated of the moderns in this part of the art.\n\nOn the examination of the greater part of the passages from antiquity, it is evident that they may relate to the light and shade of single figures, without involving what is now called the science of the chiaro-oscuro. The passage of Pliny, however, already quoted, and several others, go very near to prove that this branch of painting was understood among the ancients. The dark, the light, and mezzotint are evidently and accurately described in that passage.\n\nEqually strong is that expression in Quintilian: Zeuxis luminum umbrarumque rationem invente traditur. This cannot well be otherwise translated than by the science of light and shade.\n\nThat some technical knowledge of the effect producible by raffles of light and shade was possessed by the ancients, appears indubitable from the passages adduced:\nto what extent it was carried cannot now be ascertained. In all probability they were much inferior in this respect to the moderns; otherwise, although much science of this kind could hardly be expected from the trifling performances that remain, much more would have occurred on the subject, it would have been more largely dwelt on, and more precisely expressed among the observations of ancient authors on the best painting of the ancient matters.\n\nNeither is there sufficient evidence that the ancients were eminent in that important branch of the composition of a picture, which consists in distributing the figures and objects in groups or masses. There are few examples of this difficult branch of the art among the remaining antiquities; and indeed from the paucity of the figures introduced in the generality of these ancient paintings, there is little room to expect them. But what makes it still more doubtful whether the ancients attained any degree of eminence in grouping is, that among the many paintings of these great masters enumerated by Pliny, Lucian, or Philostratus, there is none of them praised for this species of excellence. This, however, it must be confessed, may as well arise from want of knowledge in the writer as of skill in the artist; for in a picture found in Herculaneum, which represents in all probability the education of Achilles, the figure of an old man holding a child on his knees, together with that of a woman behind him, form a very agreeable group. A work of the same collection, painted in one colour on marble, consists of five figures grouped very much after the modern idea, if it were not that three of the heads are at the same height. It is extremely probable, that this model had been the copy of a picture finished in the purest times of the art. But although it were proved that the ancients did not attempt grouping their figures, it is still uncertain whether this might not arise from their peculiar and perhaps excellent taste in the arts. Wishing to enjoy in the fullest manner their painted figures as they enjoyed the aspect of a statue, they took care that every figure should be detached from another in the same picture, which permitted them to give their objects more relief, and to render them more distinct to the eye of a distant spectator.\n\nWe are not therefore to conclude, that they were entirely ignorant of grouping, on the one hand; or that they declined the execution of it from want of skill, on the other. Indeed it actually appears to have been technically attended to by them, whatever might be their comparative excellence in it; for Apelles is expressly asserted by Pliny to have been inferior to Melanthius in composition (de dispositione): and one of their paintings mentioned by the same author, is said to have contained one hundred figures; but this unwieldy number must have been offensive, if they were not grouped with some skill.\n\nFrom the connection between the sister arts of poetry, painting, and sculpture, and the admirable performances of the ancients in the other two departments of the fine arts, it is reasonable to conclude that the ancient painters were not deficient in invention. Many instances, were it necessary, might be collected in support of their well-founded claim to this branch of the art; but it will be sufficient to observe, that as invention is rather a natural endowment than an acquired talent, and as the ancients universally seem to be at least equal to the moderns in the gifts of genius and good sense, we cannot but admit, on their part, an equality with ourselves so far as invention is concerned.\n\nVery nearly connected with the subject of invention is that of the costume; by which is meant an attention to probability with respect to times, places, objects, persons, and circumstances in the transaction represented.\n\nThe ancient paintings now remaining, so far from exhibiting any proofs of attention to this important branch of the art, are full of gross violations of probability, and representations of impossible connection. But very little stress is to be laid on these instances; first, because they are evidently the performances of artists of no reputation; secondly, because none of them to which this objection can be made are regular representations of any person or transaction; and thirdly, because, as they were (for the most part) manifestly intended as ornaments to apartments, the taste of the owner, and not of the artist, would of course be chiefly consulted. Nothing, however, can be more clear than that the ancients required an attention to probability in the works of their artists; and from the manner in which their writers express themselves on the subject (not so much recommending the practice of it as taking it for granted), we may reasonably conclude, that their best painters were seldom guilty of any gross violation of the costume. Sint fata simillima veris was an apophthegm generally known, and when known must have been universally admitted.\n\nThe principles of the costume are well expressed and illustrated by Horace in the first lines of his Art of Poetry; and Vitruvius, lib. vii. chap. 5, says, that no pictures can be approved of which have not a resemblance to truth and nature. Whether the ancient painters put in practice a greater share of good sense with respect to the costume than the moderns, cannot now be accurately determined; the advantage seems to be in favour of the former: for, as we shall have occasion more particularly to observe afterwards, the most celebrated of modern painters from Raphael to Sir Joshua Reynolds have been guilty of such flagrant breaches of probability, as would appear astonishing to those who are not in the habit of expecting them.\n\nIt has been doubted whether the ancients were acquainted with the science of perspective: and if the remains of ancient painting were alone to decide the question, it must be determined against them: for the works of the ancient painters now in possession of the moderns afford no proof of attention to the rules of perspective equal to the performance of a modern sign-painter. The picture of the sacrifice among the Herculanean antiquities, and the fourth of the prints which Bellori has published and described, taken from the paintings in the sepulchre of the Naumii, are barely tolerable; but the other landscapes (almost the only remaining antique paintings which admit of perspective) are grossly defective in this particular; so much so indeed, that considering the late period when landscape-painting was introduced among the ancients, together with this manifest imperfection in point of perspective of such as are yet extant, we cannot help suspecting the inferiority of the ancients in this respect. In perspective, as in the chiaroscuro,\nPAINTING.\n\nAnd yet some general knowledge of the principles, and some degree of attention to the practice, of perspective, cannot well be denied to the ancients. They were good mathematicians, they were excellent architects, and some of them are celebrated for their skill in scene-painting. Geminius the Rhodian, contemporary with Cicero, was the author of an express treatise on perspective; and Euclid, Heliodorus, Larillus, Agatharcus, wrote also on the same subject. It is well known, besides, that the ancients practised the art of painting in perspective on walls in the same way that it is now done by the moderns; Pliny (Nat. Hist. lib. xxxv. c. 4.) says, that one of the walls of the theatre of Claudius Pulcher, representing a roof covered with tiles, was finished in so masterly a manner, that the rooks, birds of no small sagacity, taking it for a real roof, attempted to light upon it. We are likewise told, that a dog was deceived to such a degree, by certain steps in a perspective of Dantos, that expecting to find a free passage, he made up to them in full speed, and dashed out his brains. But what is still more, Vitruvius tells us in express terms by whom and at what time this art was invented. It was first practised by Agatharcus, a contemporary of Æschylus, in the theatre of Athens; and afterwards reduced to certain principles, and treated as a science, by Anaxagoras and Democritus; thus faring like other arts which existed in practice before they appeared in theory.\n\nPortrait painting seems to have been a principal employment of the first artist whom the ancients have to boast of, since Alexander is said to have permitted no painter but Apelles, and no sculptor but Phidias to take his likeness. Pliny particularizes several instances of Apelles as a portrait painter.\n\nIn the drawing and colouring of single figures, to which the ancients paid peculiar attention, they must be allowed to be equal, if not superior, to the moderns. That spirit and animation, ease and dignity, were common to the performances of ancient artists, the ancient statues and paintings still remaining most evidently evince; and as they possessed, therefore, all the requisites to excel in portrait painting, a branch of the art at all times much in request among them, there is good reason to infer, in favour of the ancients, at least an equality with the moderns in this respect.\n\nOn the whole, all the principal parts of the art, as purity of design, and beauty and expression in the forms, were not only to be found in the ancient statues, but were actually the foundation of excellence in modern painting; and hence we may conclude that their painters formed on the same models, and very often the same men who excelled in sculpture, were not inferior in those branches of the art. But with regard to the inferior parts, the allurement of colouring, the ingenuity of the chiaro-oscuro, the splendor of composition, the art of grouping figures, and the nice handling of the pencil, the moderns are superior to those ancient painters who have most deserved the notice of their contemporary writers. It is still to be observed, however, that the progress of the arts among the ancients, from the principal parts to the more splendid, was somewhat similar to that among the moderns; and as the painters of the first rank were more immediately the objects of criticism and delight to authors of genius, it is impossible at this distance of time to state any accurate comparison between the ancients and moderns in what may be termed the decay of the art. This is particularly the case with regard to colours, there being in ancient as well as in modern times two epochs; the one comprehending Polygnotus and his immediate successors, and the other the painters both of Greece and Rome after the art began to decay. The colouring of Polygnotus was hard, and his manner had something of wildness; but his design was in the highest style of perfection. In the succeeding ages the colouring was more varied, more brilliant, more harmonious, and the handling more agreeable; but the design was less elegant and exact. And the true connoisseurs continued to prefer the works of the ancient school, in the same manner that the best writers in our times prefer the works of the Roman and Venetian masters to the more brilliant pictures of their successors. From this statement of facts it is abundantly evident, that from the ancient authors we can form some comparison between the best ancient and modern painters in those things which are most excellent in the art; while in the inferior parts, from the silence of authors, and the loss of paintings, we have no grounds upon which a comparison can be accurately made.\n\nPART I. Principles of the Art, and the Order of the Artist's Studies.\n\nWE have joined these together, because they are like cause and effect; and comprehend both on what parts in the execution of the art the painter is to employ his chief attention, and also the manner in which he is to employ it. We shall not therefore be confined to the dry and abstract, and as it were unembodied principles, but connect them with the useful and agreeable branches of the art, in that order in which it appears to us they should be studied.\n\nSECT I. Of Anatomy.\n\nTo ask if the study of anatomy is requisite to a painter, is the same thing as to ask if, in order to learn any science, a man must first make himself acquainted with the principles of it. It would be an useless waste of time to cite, in confirmation of this truth, the authorities of the ancient matters, and the most celebrated schools. A man, who is unacquainted with the form and construction of the several bones which support and govern the human frame, and does not know in what manner the muscles moving these bones are fixed to them, can make nothing of what appears of them through the integuments with which they are covered; and which appearance is, however, the noblest object of the pencil. It is impossible for a painter to copy faithfully what he sees, unless he thoroughly understand it. Let him employ ever so much time and study in the attempt,\nit cannot but be attended with many and great mistakes: just as it must happen to a man, who undertakes to copy something in a language which he does not understand; or to translate into his own, what he has written in another, upon a subject with which he is not acquainted.\n\nIt seldom happens, that nothing more is required of a painter than to copy exactly an object which he has before him. In still and very languid attitudes, in which every member is to appear motionless and dead, a living model may, no doubt, yield for a long time a faithful image, and prove an useful pattern to him. But in regard to gestures any way sudden, motions any way violent, or those momentary attitudes which it is more frequently the painter's business to express, the case is quite different. In these a living model can hold but an instant or two; it soon grows languid, and settles into a fixed attitude, which is produced by an instantaneous concourse of the animal spirits. If, therefore, a painter possess not so thoroughly all the principles of anatomy, as to be at all times able to have immediate recourse to them; if he know not the various manners in which the several parts of the human body play, according to their various positions; living models, far from proving an useful pattern to him, will rather tend to lead him astray, and make him lose sight of truth and nature, by exhibiting the very reverse of what is required, or at least exhibiting it in a very faint and imperfect manner. In living models, we often behold those parts flow, which should be quick; those cold and torpid, which should have the greatest share of life and spirit in them.\n\nNor is it, as some may be apt to imagine, merely to represent athletic and vigorous bodies, in which the parts are most bold and determined, that anatomy is requisite: it should be understood to represent persons of the most delicate frame and condition, even women and children, whose members are smoothest and roundest, though the parts made known by it are not to be strongly expressed in such object; just as logic is equally requisite under the polished inflections of the orator, and the rough arguments of the philosopher.\n\nBut it is needless to spend much time in proving, that a painter should be acquainted with anatomy; or in showing, how far his acquaintance with it should extend. For instance, it is unnecessary for him to enter into the different systems of the nerves, blood-vessels, bowels, and the like; parts which are removed from the sight, and which therefore may be left to the surgeon and the physician, as being a guide in the operations of the former and in the prescriptions of the latter. It is enough for the painter, to be acquainted with the skeleton; in other words, with the figure and connection of the bones, which are, in a manner, the pillars and props of a human body; the origin, progress, and shape of the muscles which cover these bones; as also the different degrees in which nature has clothed the muscles with fat, for this substance lies thicker upon them in some places than in others. Above all, he should know in what manner the muscles affect the various motions and gestures of the body. A muscle is composed of two tendinous and slender parts, one called the head, the other the tail, both terminating at the bones; and of an intermediate part, called the belly. The action of a muscle consists in an extraordinary swelling of this intermediate part, while the head remains at rest, so as to bring the tail nearer the head, and consequently the part to which the tail of the muscle is fixed, nearer to that part into which the head is inserted.\n\nThere are many motions to effect which several of the muscles (for this reason called co-operating muscles) must swell and operate together, while those calculated to effect a contrary motion (and therefore called antagonistic muscles) appear soft and flaccid. Thus, for example, the biceps and the brachioradialis internus labour when the arm is to be bent, and become more prominent than usual; while the triceps, the brachioradialis externus, and the anconeus, whose office is to extend the arm, continue, as it were, flat and idle. The same happens respectively in all the other motions of the body. When the antagonistic muscles of any part operate at one and the same time, such part becomes rigid and motionless. This action of the muscle is called tonic.\n\nMichael Angelo intended to give the public a complete treatise upon this subject; and it is no small misfortune, that he never accomplished so useful a design. This great man, having observed, as we are told in his life by Condivi, that Albert Durer was deficient on the subject, as treating only of the various measures and forms of bodies, without saying a word of their attitudes and gestures, though things of much greater importance, resolved to compose a theory, founded upon his long practice, for the service of future painters and statuaries. And, certainly, no one could be better qualified to give anatomical precepts for that purpose, than he who, in competition with Da Vinci, designed that famous cartoon of naked bodies, which was studied by Raphael himself, and afterwards obtained the approbation of the Vatican, the greatest school of the art we are now treating of.\n\nThe want of Michael Angelo's precepts may, in some measure, be supplied by other books written on the same subject by Moro, Cefio, and Tortebat; and lately by Boucheron, one of the most famous statuaries in France. But nothing can be of equal service to a young painter, with the lessons of some able dissectors; under whom, in a few months, he may make himself master of every branch of anatomy which he need to be acquainted with. A course of osteology is of no great length; and of the infinite number of muscles discovered by curious myologists, there are not above 80 or 90, with which nature sensibly operates all these motions which he can ever have occasion to imitate or express. These, indeed, he should closely study, these he should carefully store up in his memory, so as never to be at the least loss for their proper figure, situation, office, and motion.\n\nBut there is another thing, besides the dissection of dead bodies, by which a young painter may profit greatly; and that is anatomical casts. Of these we have numbers by several authors; nay, some which pass under the name of Buonarroti himself. But there is one in which, above all the rest, the parts are most distinctly and lively expressed. This is the performance of Hercules Lelli, who has perhaps gone greater lengths in this kind of study than any other master. We have, besides, by the same able hand, some casts of particular parts of the human body, so curiously coloured for the use of young painters, as to represent these parts exactly as they appear on removing the integuments; and thus,\nAnatomy by the difference in their colour as well as configuration, render the tendinous and the fleshy parts, the belly and the extremities of every muscle surprisingly distinct; at the same time that, by the various direction of the fibres, the motion and play of these muscles become very obvious; a work of the greatest use, and never enough to be commended! Perhaps, indeed, it would be an improvement, to give the muscles various tints; those muscles, especially, which the pupil might be apt to mistake for others. For example, though the trapezius, the deltoides, the fartoarius, the fascia lata, the gastrocnemii, are, of themselves, sufficiently distinguishable, it is not so with regard to the muscles of the arm and of the back, the right muscles of the belly, and some others, which, either on account of the many parts into which they branch, or of their being interwoven one with another, do not so clearly and fairly present themselves to the eye. But let the cause of confusion to young beginners be what it will, it may be effectually removed, by giving, as already hinted, different colours to the different muscles, and illumining anatomical figures; in the same manner that maps are coloured, in order to enable us readily to distinguish the several provinces of every kingdom, and the several dominions of every prince.\n\nThe better to understand the general effect, and remember the number, situation, and play of the muscles, it will be proper to compare, now and then, the anatomical casts, and even the dead body itself, with the living body covered with its fat and skin; and above all things, with the Greek statues still in being. It was the peculiar happiness of the Greeks, to be able to characterize and express the several parts of the human body much better than we can pretend to do; and this, on account of their particular application to the study of naked figures, especially the fine living ones which they had continually before their eyes. It is well known, that the muscles most used are likewise the most protuberant and conspicuous; such as, in those who dance much, the muscles of the legs; and in boatmen, the muscles of the back and arms. But the bodies of the Grecian youth, by means of their constant exertion of them in all the gymnastic sports, were so thoroughly exercised, as to supply the statuary with much more perfect models than ours can pretend to be.\n\nThere are a great many exercises, which a young painter should go through while engaged in the study of anatomy, in order to make himself more thoroughly master of that science. For example: The thighs of any figure, a Laocoon for instance, being given, he should add to them legs suitable to that flate in which the muscles of the thighs are represented, that is, the muscles which serve to bend and extend the legs, and to effectuate in them such a precise position and no other. To the simple contour of an anatomy, or a statue, he should add the parts included by it, and give it a system of muscles conformable to the quality of that particular contour; for every contour denotes someone certain attitude, motion, exertion, and no other. Exercises of this kind would soon establish him in the most fundamental principles of painting, especially if he had an opportunity of comparing his drawings with the statue or cast from which the parts given him to work upon were taken, and thereby discovering and correcting his mistakes. This method is very like that used by those who teach the Latin tongue; when, having given their scholars a passage of Livy or Caesar already translated into their mother-tongue, to translate back into Latin, they make them compare their work with the original text.\n\nSect. II. Of Perspective.\n\nThe study of perspective should go hand in hand with that of anatomy, as not less fundamental and necessary. In fact, the contour of an object drawn upon paper or canvas, represents nothing more than such an interference of the visual rays sent from the extremities of it to the eye, as would arise on a glass put in the place of the paper or canvas. Now, the situation of an object at the other side of a glass being given, the delineation of it on the glass itself depends entirely on the situation of the eye on this side of the glass; that is to say, on the rules of perspective: a science which, contrary to the opinion of most people, extends much farther than the painting of scenes, floors, and what generally goes under the name of quadratura. Perspective, according to that great master da Vinci, is to be considered as the reins and rudder of painting. It teaches in what proportion the parts fly from, and lessen upon the eye; how figures are to be marshalled upon a plain surface, and foreshortened. It contains, in short, the whole rationale of design.\n\nSuch are the terms which the masters best grounded in their profession have employed to define and commend perspective: so far were they from calling it a fallacious art, and an insidious guide; as some amongst the moderns have not blushed to do, insisting, that it is to be followed no longer than it keeps the high road, or leads by easy and pleasant paths. But these writers plainly show, that they are equally ignorant of the nature of perspective, which, founded as it is on geometrical principles, can never lead its votaries astray; and of the nature of their art, which, without the assistance of perspective, cannot, in rigour, expect to make any progress, nay, not so much as to delineate a simple contour.\n\nWhen a painter has formed a scene in his mind, and supposed, as it is customary, that the capital figures of this scene lie close, or almost close, to the back of his canvas, he is, in the next place, to fix upon some point on this side of the canvas, from which he would choose his piece should be seen. But in choosing this point, which is called the point of sight, regard should be had to its situation to the right or left of the middle of the canvas: but, above all things, to its distance and its height with respect to the lower edge of the canvas; which edge is called the base line, and is parallel with the horizontal line that passes through the eye. For by afflicting the point of sight, and consequently the horizontal line, too low, the planes upon which the figures stand will appear a great deal too shallow; as, by afflicting it too high, they will appear too steep, so as to render the piece far less light and airy than it ought to be. In like manner, if the point of sight is taken at too great a distance from the canvas, the figures will not admit of degradation enough to be seen with sufficient distinctness; and if taken too near it, the degradation...\nP A I N T I N G.\n\nPart I.\n\ndation will be too quick and precipitate to have an agreeable effect. Thus, then, it appears, that no final attention is requisite in the choice of this point.\n\nWhen a picture is to be placed on high, the point of sight should be assumed low, and vice versa; in order that the horizontal line of the picture may be, as near as possible, in the same horizontal plane with that of the spectator; for this disposition has an amazing effect. When a picture is to be placed very high, as amongst many others, that of the Purification by Paolo Veronese, engraved by le Fevre, it will be proper to assume the point of sight so low, that it may lie quite under the picture, no part of whose ground is, in that case, to be visible; for, were the point of sight to be taken above the picture, the horizontal ground of it would appear sloping to the eye, and both figures and buildings as ready to tumble head foremost. It is true, indeed, that there is seldom any necessity for such extraordinary exactness; and that, unless in some particular cases, the point of sight had better be rather high than low: the reason of which is, that, as we are more accustomed to behold people on the same plane with ourselves, than either higher or lower, the figures of a piece must strike us most when standing on a plane nearly level with that upon which we ourselves stand. To this it may be added, that by placing the eye low, and greatly shortening the plane, the heels of the back figures will seem to bear against the heads of the foremost, so as to render the distance between them far less perceptible than otherwise it would be.\n\nThe point of sight being fixed upon according to the situation in which the picture is to be placed, the point of distance is next to be determined. In doing this, a painter should carefully attend to three things: first, that the spectator may be able to take in, at one glance, the whole and every part of the composition; secondly, that he may see it distinctly; and, thirdly, that the degradation of the figures and other objects of the picture be sufficiently sensible. It would take up too much time to lay down certain and precise rules for doing all this, considering the great variety in the sizes and shapes of pictures; for which reason we must leave a great deal to the discretion of the painter.\n\nBut there is a point still remaining, which will not admit of the least latitude. This is, the delineation of the picture, when once the point of sight has been fixed upon. The figures of a picture are to be considered as so many columns erected on different spots of the same plane; and the painter must not think of designing anything till he has laid down, in perspective, all those columns which are to enter his composition, with the most scrupulous exactness. By proceeding in this manner, he may not only be sure of not committing any mistake in the diminution of his figures according to their different distances, but may flatter himself with the thoughts of treading in the steps of the greatest masters. It is to the punctual observance of these laws, that we are to attribute the grand effect of some paintings by Carpazio and Mantegna, so careless in other respects; whereas a single fault against them is often sufficient entirely to spoil the works of a Guido, in spite of the sublimity and beauty of his superior style.\n\nNow, as the demonstration of the rules of perspective depends on the doctrine of proportions, on the properties of similar triangles, and on the intersection of planes, it will be proper to put an abridgement of Euclid into the Symmetry, heads of the young painter, that he may understand these rules fundamentally, and not stand confined to a blind practice of them: but, then, there is nothing in this author relative to the art of painting, which may not be easily acquired in a few months. For, as it would be of no use to a painter to launch out into the anatomical depths of a Monro or an Albinius, it would be equally superfluous to perplex himself with the intricacies of the higher geometry with a Taylor, who has handled perspective with that rich profoundness, which we cannot help thinking does a great deal more honour to a mathematician, than it can possibly bring advantage to a simple artist.\n\nBut though a much longer time were requisite to become a perfect master of perspective, a painter, surely, ought not to grudge it; as no time can be too long to acquire that knowledge, without which he cannot possibly expect to succeed. Nay, we may boldly affirm, that the shortest road in every art is that which leads through theory to practice. From theory arises that great facility, by means of which a man advances the quicker, in proportion as he is fitter of not taking a wrong step; whilst those, who are not grounded in the science, labour on in perpetual doubt; obliged, as a certain author expresses it, to feel out their way with a pencil, just as the blind, with their sticks, feel for the streets and turnings, with which they are not acquainted.\n\nAs practice, therefore, ought in every thing to be built upon principle, the study of Optics, as far as it is requisite to determine the degree in which objects are to be illuminated or shaded, should proceed hand in hand with that of perspective: And this, in order that the shades, cast by figures upon the planes on which they stand, may fall properly, and be neither too strong nor too light; in a word, that those most beautiful effects of the chiaro-scuro may run no risk of ever receiving the lie from truth, which sooner or later discovers itself to every eye.\n\nSect. III. Of Symmetry.\n\nThe study of symmetry, it is obvious, should immediately follow that of anatomy; for it would avail us little to be acquainted with the different parts of the human body, and their several offices, were we at the same time ignorant of the order and proportion of those parts in regard to the whole in general, and to each other in particular. The Greek statuaries distinguished themselves above all others, as much by the just symmetry of their members, as by their skill in anatomy; but Polycletes Plinii surpassed them all by a statue, called the Rule, from Nat. Hist., which, as from a most accurate pattern, other artists might take measures for every part of the human body. c. 8.\n\nThese measures, to say nothing of the books which treat professedly of them, may now be derived from the Apollo of Belvedere, the Laocoon, the Venus of Medicis, the Faunus, and particularly the Antinous, which last was the rule of the learned Poussin.\n\nIt is the general opinion of painters, that the ancients were not so happy in representing the bodies of children, as they are allowed to have been in representing those of women and men; especially those of their gods; in which they excelled to such a degree, that with these gods were often worshipped the artists who had carved them. Yet\nSymmetry, the Venus of Gnidus by Praxiteles was not more famous than her Cupid, on whose account alone people flocked to Thebes. To children, say they, the ancients knew not how to impart that softness and effeminacy which Flamingo has since contrived to give them, by representing their cheeks, hands, and feet, swelled, their heads large, and with scarce any belly. But such critics seem to forget, that these first sketches of nature very seldom come in the painter's way, and that this puny and delicate state has not in its form even the least glimmering of perfection. The ancients never undertook to represent children less than four or five years old; at which age the superfluous humours of the body being in some measure digested, their members begin to assume such a contour and proportion as may serve to point out what they are afterwards likely to be. This observation is confirmed by the children which we meet with in ancient bas-reliefs and paintings: for they are all doing one thing or another; like those most beautiful little Cupids in a picture at Venice, who are playing with the arms of Mars, and lifting up the ponderous sword of that Deity; or that little urchin in the Daniele of Caracci, who empties a quiver of its arrows in order to fill it with the golden flower. Now, what can be a greater blunder in point of costume, than to attribute actions, which require some degree of strength and judgement, to infancy, to that raw and tender age so totally unable to govern and support itself?\n\nLet a young painter consider the Greek statues ever so often, of whatever character or age they may be represented, it is impossible he should ever consider them without discovering new beauties in them. It is therefore impossible he should copy them too often, according to that judicious motto placed by Maratti on his print called The school. This truth was acknowledged by Rubens himself; for though, like one bred, as he was, in the foggy climate of the Low Countries, he generally painted from the life; in some of his works he copied the ancients; nay, he wrote a treatise on the excellency of the ancient statues, and on the duty of a painter to study and imitate them. As to the satirical print, or rather pastime, of the great Titian, in which he has represented a parcel of young monkeys aping the group of Laocoon and his sons; he intended nothing more by it than to lash the dulness and poverty of those artists, who cannot so much as draw a figure without having a statue before them as a model.\n\nIn fact, reason requires, that an artist should be so much master of his art, as seldom to stand in need of a pattern. To what other purpose is he to sweat and toil from his infancy, and spend so many days and nights in studying and copying the best models; especially the finest faces of antiquity, which we are still possessed of; such as the two Niobes, mother and daughter; the Ariadne, the Alexander, the young Nero, the Silenus, the Nile; and likewise the finest figures; for instance, the Apollo, the Gladiator, the Venus, and others; all which (as was said of Pietro Fetta), he should have, as it were, perfectly by heart! With a stock of excellencies like these, treasured up in his memory, he may one day hope to produce something of his own without a model; form a right judgement of those natural beauties which fall in his way; and, when occasion offers, avail himself properly of them.\n\nIt is very injudicious to send boys to an academy to draw after naked figures, before they have imbibed a symmetry proper relish for beautiful proportions, and have been well-grounded in the true principles of symmetry. They should first learn, by studying the precious remains of antiquity, to improve upon life; and discern where a natural figure is faulty through stiffness in the members, or clumsiness in the trunk, or in any other respect; so as to be able to correct the faulty part, and reduce it to its proper bounds. Painting, in this branch, is, like medicine, the art of taking away and adding.\n\nIt must not, however, be dissembled, that the methods hitherto laid down are attended with some danger: for by too lavish an attention to statues, the young painter may contract a hard and dry manner; and by studying anatomies too fervently, a habit of representing living bodies as stripped of their skin: for after all, there is nothing but what is natural, that, besides a certain peculiar grace and liveliness, possesses that simplicity, ease, and softness, which is not to be expected in the works of art, or even in those of nature when deprived of life. Poussin himself has now and then given into one of these extremes, and Michael Angelo very often into the other: but from this we can only infer, that even the greatest men are not infallible. It is, in short, to be considered as one instance, among a thousand, of the ill use those are wont to make of the best things, who do not know how to temper and qualify them properly with their contraries.\n\nBut no such danger can arise to a young painter from confining himself for a long time to mere design, so as not to attempt colouring till he has made himself master of that branch. If, according to a great master*, colours in painting are in regard to the eye what numbers* in poetry are in regard to the ear, so many charms to his Life allure and captivate that sense; may we not affirm, that by Design is in the same art what propriety of language is in writing, and a just utterance of sounds in music? Whatever some people may think, a picture designed according to the rules of perspective and the principles of anatomy, will ever be held in higher esteem by good judges, than a picture ill designed, let it be ever so well coloured. Hannibal Caracci set for great a value upon the art of contour, that, according to some expressions of his which have reached us, he considered almost everything else as nothing in comparison with it. And this his judgement may be justified, by considering, that nature, though the forms men of various colours and complexions, never operates in the motions contrary to the mechanical principles of anatomy, nor, in exhibiting these motions to the eye, against the geometrical laws of perspective: a plain proof, that, in point of design, no mitake is to be deemed trifling. Hence we are enabled to feel all the weight of those words in which Michael Angelo, after he considered a picture drawn by a prince of the Venetian school, addressed Vasari! \"What a pity it is,\" said he, \"that this man did not set out by studying design!\" As the energy of nature shines most in the smallest subjects, so the energy of art shines most in imitating them.\n\nSect. IV. Of Imitation.\n\nWhen you consider art as the imitation of nature (says Mengs), it is not to be understood that nature, which is the object, is more perfect than art which imitates\nNature, it is confessed, offers some views of which the imitation must for ever remain imperfect; as in the instance of the claro-obscuro; but, on the other hand, in every thing relative to beauty of form, imitation may even surpass nature. Nature, in her productions, is subject to many accidents. Art, labouring on passive and obedient materials, renders perfect the objects of its creation, chooses every thing in nature the most excellent, and collects the different parts and the different beauties of many individuals into one whole. It is seldom that we find in the same man greatness of soul and the due proportions of body, vigour, suppleness, firmness, and agility, joined together. Art constantly represents what is rarely or never to be met with in human nature; regularity in the outlines, grandeur in the forms, grace in the attitudes, beauty in the members, force in the breast, agility in the limbs, address in the arms, frankness in the forehead, spirit in the eyes, and affability over the whole countenance. Let an artist give force and expression to all the parts of his subject, let him vary this force and expression as different circumstances make it necessary, and he will soon perceive that art may surpass nature. But although this be granted, the artist is not to imagine that art is actually arrived at this supreme degree of perfection, and can proceed no farther. The moderns seem never to have perceived the truth pointed out by the ancient Greeks: for, since the revival of painting, the true and the agreeable, instead of the beautiful, have been the objects of cultivation. Still, however, imitation is the first part of the art of painting, though not the most excellent or beautiful. It is a necessary step in the progress which leads forward to greater perfection.\n\nA painter ought attentively to consider, compare together, and weigh in the balance of reason and truth, all the different styles of the great masters; but he ought likewise carefully to guard against too great a fondness for any one of them in particular that he may think proper to adopt; otherwise, to use the expression of a first-rate master*, instead of the child, he would become the grand child of nature.\n\nBesides, his imitation must be of generals, and not of particulars. Whatever a young painter's natural disposition may be, whether to paint boldly and freely like Tintoret and Rubens, or to labour his works, like Titian or da Vinci, let him follow it. This kind of imitation is very commendable. It is thus that Dante, at the same time that he carefully avoided adopting the particular expressions of Virgil, endeavoured to seize his bold and free manner, and at last caught from him that elegance of style which has done him so much honour.\n\nAs to the rest, nothing should hinder an able master from making use now and then of any antique, or even modern figure, which he may find his account in employing. Sanzio, in a St Paul at Lystra, scrupled not to avail himself of an ancient sacrifice in bas-relief; nor did Buonarroti himself disdain to use, in his paintings of the Sextine chapel, a figure taken from the famous cornelian which tradition tells us he wore on his finger, and which was lately in the possession of the most Christian king. Men like these avail themselves of the productions of others in such a manner as to make us apply to them, what La Bruyere said of Delpreaux, that one would imagine the thoughts of other men had been of his own creation.\n\nIn general, a painter should have his eye constantly fixed on nature, that inexhaustible and varied source of every kind of beauty; and should study to imitate her in her most singular effects. As beauty, scattered over the whole universe, shines brighter in some objects than in others, he should never be without his little book and crayon, in order to make drawings of every beautiful or uncommon object that may happen to present itself; and take sketches of every fine building, every situation, every effect of light, every flight of clouds, every flow of drapery, every attitude, every expression of the passions, that may happen to strike him. He may afterwards employ these things as occasions offer; and in the mean time will have the advantage of acquiring a grand taste.\n\nIt is by carefully studying the best masters, and imitating nature, that a painter arrives at the style of perfection which the Italians call gufo grande, the French le beau ideal, and the English the great style.\n\n\"A mind (says Sir Joshua Reynolds), enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures of ancient and modern art, will be more elevated and fruitful in resources in proportion to the number of ideas which have been carefully collected and thoroughly digested.\n\n\"The addition of other men's judgement is so far from weakening, as is the opinion of many, our own, that it will fashion and consolidate those ideas of excellence which lay in their birth feeble, ill-shaped, and confused; but which are finished and put in order by the authority and practice of those, whose works may be said to have been consecrated by having stood the test of ages.\n\n\"When we speak of the habitual imitation and continued study of matters, it is not to be understood that I advise any endeavour to copy the exact peculiar colour and complexion of another man's mind; the success of such an attempt must always be like his who imitates exactly the air, manner, and gestures, of him whom he admires. His model may be excellent, but he himself will be ridiculous; and this ridicule arises not from his having imitated, but from his not having chosen the right mode of imitation.\n\n\"It is a necessary warrantable pride to disdain to walk servilely behind any individual, however elevated his rank. The true and liberal ground of imitation is an open field, where, though he who precedes has had the advantage of starting before you, yet it is enough to pursue his course: you need not tread in his footsteps; and you certainly have a right to outstrip him if you can.\n\n\"Nor, whilst I recommend studying the art from artists, can I be supposed to mean that nature is to be neglected: I take this study in aid, and not in exclusion of the other. Nature is, and must be, the fountain, which alone is inexhaustible; and from which all excellencies must originally flow.\n\n\"The great use of studying our predecessors is to open the mind, to shorten our labour, and to give us the result of the selection made by those great minds of what is grand or beautiful in nature: her rich stores are all spread out before us; but it is an art, and no easy art, to know how or what to choose, and how to attain and secure the object of our choice.\n\n\"Thus the highest beauty of form must be taken from nature; but it is an art of long deduction and great experience to know how to find it. I cannot avoid...\"\nPart I.\n\nPAINTING\n\nColouring: avoid mentioning here an error which students are apt to fall into.\n\n\"He that is forming himself must look with great caution and wariness on those peculiarities or prominent parts which at first force themselves on view, and are the marks, or what is commonly called the manner, by which that individual artist is distinguished.\n\n\"Peculiar marks I hold to be generally, if not always, defects, however difficult it may be wholly to escape them.\n\n\"Peculiarities in the works of art are like those in the human figure; it is by them that we are cognizable and distinguished one from another; but they are always so many blemishes, which, however, both in the one case and in the other, cease to appear deformities to those who have them continually before their eyes. In the works of art, even the most enlightened mind, when warmed by beauties of the highest kind, will by degrees find a repugnance within him to acknowledge any defects; nay, his enthusiasm will carry him far as to transform them into beauties and objects of imitation.\n\n\"It must be acknowledged, that a peculiarity of style, either from its novelty, or by seeming to proceed from a peculiar turn of mind, often escapes blame; on the contrary, it is sometimes striking and pleasing; but it is vain labour to endeavour to imitate it, because novelty and peculiarity being its only merit, when it ceases to be new, it ceases to have value.\n\n\"A manner, therefore, being a defect, and every painter, however excellent, having a manner, it seems to follow that all kinds of faults as well as beauties may be learned under the sanction of the greatest authority.\"\n\nSect. V. Of Colouring.\n\nCOLOURING, though a subject greatly inferior to many others which the painter must study, is yet of sufficient importance to employ a considerable share of his attention; and to excel in it, he must be well acquainted with that part of optics which has the nature of light and colours for its object. Light, however simple and uncompounded it may appear, is nevertheless made up, as it were, of several distinct substances; and the number, and even dole, of these ingredients, has been happily discovered by the moderns. Every undivided ray, let it be ever so fine, is a little bundle of red, orange, yellow, green, azure, indigo, and violet rays, which, while combined, are not to be distinguished one from another, and form that kind of light called white: so that white is not a colour per se, as the learned Da Vinci (to far, it seems, the precursor of Newton) expressly affirms, but an assemblage of colours. Now these colours, which compose light, although immutable in themselves, and endowed with various qualities, are continually, however, separating from each other in their reflection from and passage through other substances, and thus become manifest to the eye. Grass, for example, reflects only green rays, or rather reflects green rays in greater number than it does those of any other colour; one kind of wine transmits red rays, and another yellowish rays; and from this kind of separation arises that variety of colours with which nature has diversified her various productions. Man, too, has contrived to separate the rays of light by making a portion of the sun's beams pass through a glass prism; for after passing through it, they appear divided into seven pure and primitive colours, placed in succession one by the other, like so many colours on a painter's pallet.\n\nNow, though Titian, Corregio, and Van Dyke, have been excellent colourists, without knowing anything of these physical subtleties, that is no reason why others should neglect them. For it cannot but be of great service to a painter to be well acquainted with the nature of what he is to imitate, and of those colours with which he is to give life and perfection to his designs; not to speak of the pleasure there is in being able to account truly and solidly for the various effects and appearances of light. From a due tempering, for example, and degrading, of the tints in a picture; from making colours partake of each other, according to the reflection of light from one object to another; there arises, in some measure, that sublime harmony which may be considered as the true music of the eye. And this harmony has its foundation in the genuine principles of optics. Now this could not happen in the system of those philosophers, who held, that colours did not originally exist in light, but were, on the contrary, nothing else than so many modifications which it underwent in being reflected from other substances, or in passing through them; thus subject to alterations without end, and every moment liable to perish. Were that the case, bodies could no more receive any hues one from another, nor this body partake of the colour of that, than scarlet, for example, because it has the power of changing into red all the rays of the sun or sky which immediately fall upon it, has the power of changing into red all the other rays reflected to it from a blue or any other colour in its neighbourhood. Whereas, allowing that colours are in their own nature immutable one into another, and that every body reflects, more or less, every sort of coloured rays, though those rays in the greatest number which are of the colour it exhibits, there must necessarily arise, in colours placed near one another, certain particular hues or temperaments of colour: nay, this influence of one colour upon another may be so far traced, that three or four bodies of different colours, and likewise the intenseness of the light falling upon each, being assigned, we may easily determine in what situations and how much they would tinge each other. We may thus, too, by the same principle of optics, account for several other things practised by painters; inasmuch that a person, who has carefully observed natural effects with an eye directed by solid learning, shall be able to form general rules, where another can only distinguish particular cases.\n\nBut after all, the pictures of the best colourists are, it is universally allowed, the books in which a young painter must chiefly look for the rules of colouring; that is, of that branch of painting which contributes so much to express the beauty of objects, and is so requisite to represent them as what they really are. Giorgio and Titian seem to have discovered circumstances in nature which others have entirely overlooked; and the last in particular has been happy enough to express them with a pencil as delicate as his eye was quick and piercing. In his works we behold that sweetness of colouring which is produced by union, that beauty which is consistent with truth; and all the insensible transmutations,\nPAINTING.\n\nColours: transmutations, all the soft transitions, in a word, all the pleasing modulations, of tints and colours. When a young painter has, by close application, acquired from Titian, whom he can never sufficiently dwell upon, that art which, of all painters, he has best contrived to hide, he would do well to turn to Bassano and Paolo, on account of the beauty, boldness, and elegance of their touches. That richness, fineness, and freshness of colouring for which the Lombard school is so justly cried up, may likewise be of great service to him. Nor will he reap less benefit by studying the principles and practice of the Flemish school; which, chiefly by means of her varnishes, has contrived to give a most enchanting lustre and transparency to her colours.\n\nBut whatever pictures a young painter may choose to study the art of colouring upon, he must take great care that they be well preserved. There are very few pieces which have not suffered more or less by the length, not to say the injuries, of time; and perhaps that precious patina, which years alone can impart to paintings, is in some measure akin to that other kind which ages alone impart to medals; inasmuch as, by giving testimony to their antiquity, it renders them proportionably beautiful in the superstitious eyes of the learned. It must indeed be allowed, that if, on the one hand, this patina begets, as it really does, an extraordinary degree of harmony upon the colours of a picture, and destroys, or at least greatly lessens, their original rawness, it, on the other hand, equally impairs the freshness and life of them. A piece seen many years after it has been painted, appears much as it would do, immediately after painting, behind a dull glaze. It is no idle opinion, that Paolo Veronese, attentive above all things to the beauty of his colours, and what is called fresco, left entirely to time the care of harmonizing them perfectly, and (as we may say) mellowing them. But most of the old masters took that task upon themselves; and never exposed their works to the eyes of the public, until they had ripened and finished them with their own hands. And who can say whether the Christ of Moneta, or the Nativity of Bassano, have been more improved or injured (if we may so speak) by the touchings and retouchings of time, in the course of more than two centuries? It is indeed impossible to be determined. But the anxious pupil may make himself ample amends for any injuries which his originals may have received from the hands of time, by turning to truth, and to Nature which never grows old, but constantly retains its primitive flower of youth, and was itself the model of the models before him. As soon, therefore, as a young painter has laid a proper foundation for good colouring, by studying the best masters, he should turn all his thoughts to truth and nature. And it would perhaps be well worth while to have, in the academies of painting, models for colouring as well as designing; that as from the one the pupils learn to give their due proportion to the several members and muscles, they may learn from the other to make their carnations rich and warm, and faithfully copy the different local hues which appear quite distinct in the different parts of a fine body. To illustrate still farther the use of such a model, let us suppose it placed in different lights: now in that of the sun, now in that of the sky, and now again in that of a lamp or candle; one time placed in the shade, and another in a reflected light. Hence the pupil may learn all the different effects of the complection in different circumstances, whether the livid, the lucid, or transparent; and, above all, that variety of tints and half tints, occasioned in the colour of the skin by the epidermis having the bones immediately under it in some places, and in others a greater or less number of blood-vessels or quantity of fat. An artist who had long studied such a model would run no risk of degrading the beauties of nature by any particularity of style, or of giving into that preposterous fulness and floridness of colour which is at present so much the taste. He would not feed his figures with roses, as an ancient painter of Greece fluently expressed it, but with good beef; a Webb dial difference which the learned eye of a modern writer could perceive between the colouring of Barocci and that of Titian. To practise in that manner, is, according to a great master, no better than inuring one's self to the commission of blunders. What statues are in design, nature is in colouring; the fountain-head of that perfection to which every artist, ambitious to excel, should constantly aspire; and accordingly the Flemish painters, in consequence of their aiming solely to copy nature, are in colouring as excellent as they are wont to be awkward in designing. The best model for the tone of colours and the degradation of shades is furnished by means of the camera obscura. See DIOPTRICS, Sect. vi. and ix.\n\nSECT. VI. Of Drapery.\n\nDrapery is one of the most important branches of the whole art, and accordingly demands the greatest attention and study. It seldom happens that a painter has nothing but naked figures to represent; nay, his subjects generally consist of figures clothed from head to foot. Now the flowing of the folds in every garment depends chiefly upon the relief of the parts that lie under it. A certain author, we forget his name, observes, that as the inequalities of a surface are discoverable by the inequalities in the water that runs over it, so the posture and shape of the members must be discernible by the folds of the garment that covers them. Those idle windings and gatherings, with which some painters have affected to cover their figures, make the clothes made up of them look as if the body had fled from under them, and left nothing in its place but a heap of empty bubbles, fit emblems of the brain that conceived them. As from the trunk of a tree there issue here and there boughs of various forms, so from one mitrefold there always flow many lesser ones; and as it is on the quality of the tree that the elegance, compactness, or openness of its branches chiefly depends; it is, in like manner, by the quality of the stuff of which a garment is made, that the number, order, and size of its folds must be determined. To sum up all in two words, the drapery ought to be natural and easy, so as to show what stuff it is, and what parts it covers. It ought, as a certain author expresses it, to cover the body, as it were merely to show it.\n\nIt was formerly the custom with some of our masters to draw all their figures naked, and then drape them; from the same principle that they first drew the skeletons of their figures, and afterwards covered them with muscles.\nDrapery. And it was by proceeding in this manner that they attained to such a degree of truth in expressing the folds of their drapery, and the joints and direction of the principal members that lay under it, so as to exhibit in a most striking manner the attitude of the person to whom they belonged. That the ancient sculptors clothed their statues with equal truth and grace, appears from many of them that are still in being; particularly a Flora lately dug up in Rome, whose drapery is executed with so much judgement, and in so grand and rich a style, that it may vie with the finest of their naked statues, even with the Venus of Medici.\n\nThe statues of the ancients had so much beauty when naked, that they retained a great deal when clothed. But here it must be considered, that it was usual with them to suppose their originals clothed with wet garments, and of an extreme fineness and delicacy, that, by lying close to the parts, and in a manner clinging to them, they might the better show what these parts were. For this reason a painter is not to confine himself to the study of the ancient statues, lest he should contract a dry style, and even fall into the same faults with some great masters who, accustomed to drape with such light stuffs as fit close to the body, have afterwards made the coarsest lie in the same manner, so as plainly to exhibit the muscles underneath them. It is therefore proper to study nature herself, and those modern masters who have come nearest to her in this branch; such as Paolo Veronese, Andrea del Sarto, Rubens, and above all, Guido Reni. The flow of their drapery is soft and gentle; and the gatherings and plaits are so contrived, as not only not to hide the body, but to add grace and dignity to it. Their gold, silk, and woollen stuffs, are so distinguishable one from another, by the quality of their several lustres, and the peculiar light and shade belonging to each, but above all by the form and flow of their folds, that the age and sex of their figures are hardly more discoverable by their faces.\n\nAlbert Durer is another great master in this branch, inasmuch that Guido himself was not ashamed to study him. There are still extant several drawings made with the pen by this great man, in which he has copied whole figures from Albert, and scrupulously retained the flow of his drapery as far as his own peculiar style, less harsh and sharp, but more easy and graceful, would allow. It may be said that he made the same use of Albert that our modern writers ought to make of the best authors of the 13th century.\n\nTo drape a figure well, it is necessary that the folds be large and few in number; because large folds produce great masses of light and shadow, while small ones multiply the objects of view and distract the attention. But if the character of the drapery or kind of stuff require small folds, they should at least be distributed in groups, in such a manner that a great number of small folds shall be subordinate to an equal mass formed by a principal fold.\n\nIt is also proper to observe, that the colour of the drapery contributes to the harmony of the whole, and produces effects which the claro obscuro cannot do alone. At the same time, the principles of the claro obscuro should prelude over, or at least regulate, the art of drapery. If the folds of the stuff which cover the members exposed to the light are too strongly shaded, they will appear to enter into the members, and cut them.\n\nDrapery contributes to the life, to the character, to the expression of the figures, provided all the movements of the folds announce the lively or more tranquil movement of those figures. The colour, and the kind of stuff, concur also to promote the general expression; brilliant or fine drapery cannot be properly introduced in a mournful subject, nor the opposite in a gay one.\n\nThe drapery must also agree with the age and character of the figures. And if nature in any instance is found to contradict these principles, it is because they relate to the ideal of the art; and it is this ideal which carries it to the greatest perfection.\n\nGreat attention is also necessary to the situation in which the figures are placed, and the actions about which they are employed. If they are in the act of ascending, a column of air weighs down the drapery; if, on the contrary, they are descending, the drapery is supported and spread out. The folds placed on every member, and the general play of the drapery, should indicate whether the figure is in action or about to be so; whether action be beginning or ending; and whether it be slow, or quick, or violent. All this is agreeable to nature; but it also partakes of the ideal, since nature never can be copied in such fluctuating situations. The practice of the Roman schools, first to draw after nature, and then to paint after the drawing, cannot be adopted by colourists; because nature, according to the kind of the stuffs, produces tones and lights which give more perfection and truth to the work. Meanwhile Raphael, who followed this practice, enjoys the first reputation for giving play to his drapery, and disposing the folds in the best order. In this part he has even attained the height of ideal beauty. He is the greatest painter of drapery, as the Venetians are the greatest in painting stuffs.\n\nRaphael says Mengs, imitated at first his master Perugino's manner of drapery; and he brought this manner to perfection, by studying the works of Masaccio and of Bartholomew; but he departed entirely from the taste of the school in which he was educated when he had seen the works of the ancients. It was the bas-relief of antiquity which pointed out to him the true flowing of drapery, and he was not backward to introduce it. He discovered, by attending to the principles of the ancients, that the naked is the principal part; that drapery is to be regarded altogether as an accessory, and that it is intended to cover, not to conceal; that it is employed from necessity, not caprice; that of consequence the clothes should not be so narrow as to constrain the members, nor so ample as to embarrass them; but that the artist should adapt them to the size and attitude of the figures intended to wear them.\n\nHe understood that the great folds should be placed at the large places of the body; and where the nature of the drapery required small folds, that it was necessary to give them a projection, which indicates a subordination to the principal parts.\n\nHe made his ample draperies without useless folds, and with bendings at the articulations. It was the form of the naked figure which pointed out to him the form\nLandscape of his folds, and on the great muscles he formed great masses. When any part required to be foreshortened, he covered it with the same number of folds as if it had been straight; but then he crowded them in proportion to the foreshortening.\n\nHe frequently discovered the border of his drapery, to show that his figures were not dressed in a simple sack. The form of the principal parts, and the specific weight of the air, were always the causes of his folds. It was easy to discover in his works, by the folds of his drapery, the attitude of the figure previous to the one in which it was placed; and whether, for example, the arm was extended or otherwise, immediately before the action. This was an expression which he had carefully studied on all occasions, because he found it in nature.\n\nWhen the drapery was to cover the leg or arm but half, or in an imperfect manner, he made it cut obliquely the member which was partly to be covered. His folds were of a triangular form. The reason of this form is in nature: for all drapery has a tendency to enlarge itself and be extended; and as at the same time its own weight obliges it to fall back on itself, it is naturally formed into triangles.\n\nHe knew perfectly that the movements of the body and of its members are the causes of the actual situation of drapery, and of the formation of its folds. All his practice is nothing else but the unfolding and demonstrating of this theory; and drapery executed in any other manner must be in a false and vicious taste.\n\nSect. VII. Of Landscape and Architecture.\n\nWhen our young painter has made a sufficient progress in those principal branches of his art, the designing, perspective, colouring, and drapery of human figures, he should turn his thoughts to landscape and architecture: for, by studying them, he will render himself universal, and qualified to undertake any subject; so as not to resemble certain literati, who, though great masters in some articles, are mere children in everything else.\n\nThe most eminent landscape painters are Poussin, Lorenese, and Titian.\n\nPoussin was remarkable for his great diligence. His pieces are quite exotic and uncommon; being set off with buildings in a beautiful but singular style; and with learned episodes, such as poets reciting their verses to the woods, and youths exercising themselves in the several gymnastic games of antiquity; by which it plainly appears, that he was more indebted for his subjects to the descriptions of Paufanias than to nature and truth.\n\nLorenese applied himself chiefly to express the various phenomena of light, especially those perceivable in the heavens. And thanks to the happy climate of Rome, where he studied and exercised his talents, he has left us the brightest skies, and the richest and most gloriously cloud-tipt horizons, that can be well conceived. Nay, the sun himself, which, like the Almighty, can be represented merely by his effects, has scarcely escaped his daring and ambitious pencil.\n\nTitian, the great confidant of nature, is the Homer of landscape. His scenes have so much truth, so much variety, and such a bloom in them, that it is impossible to behold them, without wishing, as if they were real, to make an excursion into them. And perhaps the finest landscape that ever issued from mortal hands, is the back ground of his Martyrdom of St Peter; where, by the difference between the bodies and the leaves of his trees and the disposition of their branches, one immediately discovers the difference between the trees themselves; where the different soils are so well expressed, and so exquisitely clothed with their proper plants, that a botanist has much ado to keep his hands from them. See Part II. sect. ii.\n\nPaolo Veronese is in architecture what Titian is in landscape. To excel in landscape, we must, above all things, study nature. To excel in architecture, we must chiefly regard the finest works of art; such as the fronts of ancient edifices, and the fabrics of those moderns who have best studied and best copied antiquity. Next to Brunelleschi and Alberti, who were the first revivers of architecture, came Bramante, Giulio Romano, Sanzovino, Sanmicheli, and lastly Palladio, whose works the young painter should above all the rest diligently study and imprint deeply on his mind. Nor is Vignola to be forgotten; for some think he was a more scrupulous copier of antiquity, and more exact, than Palladio himself, inasmuch that most people consider him as the first architect among the moderns. For our part, to speak of him, not as fame, but as truth seems to require, we cannot help thinking, that rather than break through the generality of the rules contrived by him to facilitate practice, he has in some instances deviated from the most beautiful proportions of the antique, and is rather barren in the distribution and disposition of certain members. Moreover, the extraordinary height of his pedestals and cornices hinders the column from showing in the orders designed and employed by him, as it does in those of Palladio. Amongst that great variety of proportions to be met with in ancient ruins, Palladio has been extremely happy in choosing the best. His profiles are well contrasted, yet easy. All the parts of his buildings hang well together. Grandeur, elegance, and beauty, walk hand in hand in them. In short, the very blemishes of Palladio, who was no slave to conveniency, and sometimes perhaps was too profuse in his decorations, are picturesque. And we may reasonably believe, that it was by following so great a master, whose works he had continually before his eyes, that Paolo Veronese formed that fine and masterly taste which enabled him to embellish his compositions with such beautiful structures.\n\nThe study of architecture cannot fail, in another respect, of being very useful to the young painter, inasmuch as it will bring him acquainted with the form of the temples, thermae, basilicas, theatres, and other buildings of the Greeks and Romans. Besides, from the bas-reliefs with which it was customary to adorn these buildings, he may gather, with equal delight and profit, the nature of their sacrifices, arms, military ensigns, and drests. The study of landscape, too, will render familiar to him the form of the various plants peculiar to each soil and climate, and such other things as serve to characterize the different regions of the earth. Thus by degrees he will learn what we call clypeum, one of the chief requisites in a painter; since by means of it he may express with great precision the time and place in which his scenes are laid.\nSect. VIII. Of the Expression of the Passions.\n\nThat language which above all others a painter should carefully endeavour to learn, and from nature herself, is the language of the passions. Without it the finest works must appear lifeless and inanimate. It is not enough for a painter to be able to delineate the most exquisite forms, give them the most graceful attitudes, and compose them well together; it is not enough to dress them out with propriety, and in the most beautiful colours; it is not enough, in fine, by the powerful magic of light and shade, to make the canvas vanish. No; he must likewise know how to clothe his figures with grief, with joy, with fear, with anger; he must, in some sort, write on their faces what they think and what they feel; he must give them life and speech. It is indeed in this branch that painting truly soars, and in a manner rises superior to itself; it is in this branch he makes the spectator apprehend much more than what he expresses.\n\nThe means employed in her imitations by painting, are the circumvention of terms, the chiaro-tenuto, and colours; all which appear solely calculated to strike the visual faculty. Notwithstanding which, she contrives to represent hard and soft, rough and smooth surfaces, which are objects of the touch; and this by means of certain tints, and a certain chiaro-tenuto, which has a different look in marble, in the bark of trees, in downy and delicate substances. Nay, she contrives to express sound and motion, by means of light and shade, and certain particular configurations. In some landscapes of Diderich, we almost hear the water murmur, and see it tremble along the sides of the river and of the boats upon it. In the Battle of Burgogne, we are really apt to fancy that the trumpet sounds; and we see the horse, who has thrown his rider, scamper along the plain. But what is still more wonderful, painting, in virtue of her various colours and certain particular gestures, expresses even the sentiments and most hidden affections of the soul, and renders her visible, so as to make the eye not only touch and hear, but even kindle into passion and reason.\n\nMany have written, and amongst the rest the famous Le Brun, on the various changes that, according to the various passions, happen in the muscles of the face, which is, as it were, the dumb tongue of the soul. They observe, for example, that in fits of anger the face reddens, the muscles of the lips puff out, the eyes sparkle; and that, on the contrary, in fits of melancholy, the eyes grow motionless and dead, the face pale, and the lips sink in. It may be of service to a painter to read these and such other remarks; but it will be of infinitely more service to study them in nature itself, from which they have been borrowed, and which exhibits them in that lively manner which neither tongue nor pen can express.\n\nUpon Le Brun's Treatise on the Passions, we have the following just, though severe, criticism by Winckelmann. \"Expression, though precarious in its nature (says he), has been reduced into a system, in a Treatise on the Passions by Charles le Brun, a work generally put into the hands of young artists. The plates which accompany this treatise do not only give to the face the affections of the soul in too high a tone, but there are many of the heads in which the passions are represented in an outrageous manner. He appears to give instructions in expression, as Diogenes gave examples of morality: I act like musicians, said that cynic, who gives a high tone, in order to indicate a true one. But the fervour of youth has naturally more inclination to seize the extreme than the middle; and hence it is difficult for the young artist, in copying after Le Brun, to seize the true tone. Youth in general may be supposed to have that regard for the calm and moderate in the arts, which they have for the precepts of wisdom and virtue.\"\n\nOther French writers have given instructions respecting the expression of the passions, equally exceptional with those of Le Brun. All of them whom we have consulted make to many divisions and subdivisions of passions, that a philosopher cannot follow them in metaphysical theory, nor a painter exhibit their effects upon canvas. Nature therefore must be his guide, particularly in treating those very minute and almost imperceptible differences, by which, however, things very different from each other are often expressed. This is particularly the case with regard to the passions of laughing and crying; as in thee, however contrary, the muscles of the face operate nearly in the same manner. As the famous Pietro de Cortona was one day finishing the face of a crying child in a representation of the Iron Age, with which he was adorning the floor called the Hall-bath in the royal palace of Pitti, Ferdinand II., who happened to be looking over him for his amusement, could not forbear expressing his approbation, by crying out, \"Oh how well that child cries!\" To whom the artist—\"Has your majesty a mind to see how easy it is to make children laugh? Behold, I'll prove it in an instant:\" And taking up his pencil, by giving the contour of the mouth a concave turn downwards instead of the convex upwards which it before had, and with little or no alteration in any other part of the face, he made the child, who a little before seemed ready to burst its heart with crying, appear in equal danger of bursting its sides with immoderate laughter; and then, by restoring the altered features to their former position, he soon let the child a-crying again.\"\n\nThe different expressions of laughter and weeping are thus described by Le Brun. \"The movements of Philip Balducci's Lectures of laughter are expressed by the eye-brows elevated towards the Acadiana, lowered towards the sides of the nose: the eyes, almost shut, appear sombre; the Lylyrates, times moistened with tears: the mouth, a little open, allows the teeth to be seen: the extremities of the mouth drawn back, make a dimple in the cheeks, which appear to be swelled: the nostrils are open: and the face becomes red. The changes which weeping occasions are equally visible. The eye-brow is lowered on the middle of the forehead; the eyes are almost shut, moistened, and lowered towards the sides of the cheeks: the nostrils are swelled, and the veins of the forehead very apparent: the mouth shut, by the lowering of its sides, occasions wrinkles in the cheeks; the under lip is turned down, and presses at the same time the upper lip: the whole countenance is wrinkled and becomes red; especially the eye-brows, the eyes, the nose, and the cheeks.\"\n\nAccording to Leonardo da Vinci, the best masters\nExpression that a painter can have recourse to in this branch are those dumb men who have found out the method of expressing their sentiments by the motion of their hands, eyes, eyebrows, and in almost every other part of the body. If this advice be at all proper, such gestures must be imitated with great sobriety and moderation, lest they should appear too strong and exaggerated; and the piece should show nothing but pantomimes, when speaking figures alone are to be exhibited; and so become theatrical and second-hand, or, at best, look like the copy of a theatrical and second-hand nature.\n\nThe artist will reap greater benefit from studying such fine ancient heads as those of Mithridates, Sengca, Alexander dying, Cleopatra, Niobe, &c., and above all, from attentively observing such movements of nature as we daily meet with in the world. But let him chiefly consult his looking-glass, and study after his own face, what, in certain expressions, are the muscles, the lineaments, the tints, and the accidental circumstances which characterize the situation of the soul. It rarely happens that a model, which is affected with no sentiment, presents to us which we ourselves feel, and which we are capable of expressing when we are our own model. Puget executed the legs of his Milo after his own; and many ingenious artists have had recourse to a similar expedient. In short, to be affected ourselves is the true secret of affecting the spectator.\n\nWe must not neglect, at the same time, to secure the fleeting characters which nature presents to us on a thousand occasions. We must distrust our memory, and all the resources which are not easily employed when we happen to stand in need of them. It is necessary to watch the circumstances from which we can derive any useful hint; to seize them when they present themselves; and to be careful never to lose, by an irreparable negligence, the fruit of a happy incident.\n\nLet us also endeavour to polish the feeling of what we are to express: whether it be by forming the image of a thing absent as if it were present, or by being affected with the lively idea of a situation which we have either experienced, or with which we have seen another person remarkably affected. We must never forget, that all the terrible or agreeable, the violent or slight movements, are to be treated in a natural manner, and bear a relation to the age, condition, sex, and dignity of the person. Those gradations, which art varies according to the nature of the situation, and the character of men, compose the principal ingredients of delicacy, knowledge, and taste. They have been the objects of attention and inquiry to the most eminent painters of every age; and they were of the last importance in afflicting them to arrive at that degree of excellence to which they have carried expression.\n\nWe are told strange things of the ancient painters of Greece in regard to expression; especially of Ariades; who, in a picture of his, representing a woman wounded to death at a siege, with a child crawling to her breast, makes her appear afraid, lest the child, when she was dead, should, for want of milk, suck her blood. A Medea murdering her children, by Timonachus, was likewise much cried up, as the ingenious artist contrived to express, at once, in her countenance, both the fury that hurried her on to the commission of so great a crime, and the tenderness of a mother that seemed to withhold her from it. Rubens attempted to express such a double effect in the face of Mary of Medicis, still in pain from her past labour, and at the same time full of joy at the birth of a Dauphin. And in the countenance of Sancta Polonia, painted by Tiepolo for St Anthony's church at Padua, one may clearly read a mixture of pain from the wound given her by the executioner, and of pleasure from the prospect of paradise opened to her by it.\n\nFew, to say the truth, are the examples of strong expression afforded by the Venetian, Flemish, or Lombard schools. Deprived of that great happiness, the happiness of being able to contemplate, at leisure, the works of the ancients, the purest sources of perfection in point of design, expression, and character; and having nothing but nature constantly before their eyes; they made strength of colouring, blooming complections, and the grand effects of chiaro-oscuro, their principal study: they aimed more at charming the senses than at captivating the understanding. The Venetians, in particular, seem to have placed their whole glory in setting off their pieces with all that rich variety of personages and drapery, which their capital is continually receiving by means of its extensive commerce, and which attracts to much the eyes of all those who visit it. It is much to be doubted, if, in all the pictures of Paolo Veronese, there is to be found a bold and judicious expression, or one of those attitudes which, as Petrarch expresses it, speak without words; unless, perhaps, it be that remarkable one in his Marriage Feast of Cana of Galilee. At one end of the table, and directly opposite to the bridegroom, whose eyes are fixed upon her, there appears a woman in red, holding up to him the skirt of her garment; as much as to say, we may suppose, that the wine miraculously produced was exactly of the colour with the stuff on her back. And in fact it is red wine we see in the cups and pitchers. But all this while the faces and attitudes of most of the company betray not the least sign of wonder at so extraordinary a miracle. They all, in a manner, appear intent upon nothing but eating, drinking, and making merry. Such, in general, is the style of the Venetian school. The Florentine, over which Michael Angelo presided, above all things curious of design, was most minutely and scrupulously exact in point of anatomy. On this she set her heart, and took singular pleasure in displaying it. Not only elegance of form, and nobleness of invention, but likewise strength of expression, triumph in the Roman school, nursed as it were amongst the works of the Greeks, and in the bosom of a city which had once been the seminary of learning and politeness. Here it was that Domenichino and Poussin, both great masters of expression, refined themselves, as appears more particularly by the St Jerome of the one, and the Death of Germanicus, and the Slaughter of the Innocents, by the other. Here it was that Raphael arose, the sovereign master of them all. One would imagine, that pictures, which are generally considered as the books of the ignorant, and of the ignorant only, he had undertaken to make the instructors even of the learned. One would imagine, that he intended, in some measure, to justify Quintilian*, who* affirms, that painting has more power over us than all the arts of rhetoric. There is not, indeed, a single pie-\nExpression of Raphael's, from the study of which those who are curious in point of expression may not reap great benefit; particularly his Martyrdom of St Felicitas, his Transfiguration, his Joseph explaining to Pharaoh his dream, a piece so highly rated by Poullin. His School of Athens in the Vatican, is, to all intents and purposes a school of expression. Among the many miracles of art with which this piece abounds, we shall single out that of the four boys attending on a mathematician, who, stooping to the ground with his compasses in his hand, is giving them the demonstration of a theorem. One of the boys, recollecting within himself, keeps back, with all the appearance of profound attention to the reasoning of the master; another, by the briskness of his attitude, discovers a greater quickness of apprehension; while the third, who has already seized the conclusion, is endeavouring to beat it into the fourth, who, standing motionless, with open arms, a flaring countenance, and an unspeakable air of stupidity in his looks, will never perhaps be able to make anything of the matter. And it is probable from this very group that Albani, who studied Raphael so closely, drew the following precept of his; \"That it behoves a painter to express more circumstances than one by every attitude; and to employ his figures, that, by barely seeing what they are actually about, one may be able to guess, both what they have been already doing, and are next going to do.\" This is indeed a difficult precept; but it is only by a due observance of it that the eye and the mind can be made to hang in suspense on a painted piece of canvas. It is expression that a painter, ambitious to soar in his profession, must, above all things, labour to perfect himself in. It is the last goal of his art, as Socrates proves to Parthasius. It is in expression that dumb poetry consists, and what the prince of our poets calls a visible language.\n\nSect. IX. Of Invention.\n\nAs the operations of a general should all ultimately tend to battle and conquest, so should all the thoughts of a painter to perfect invention. Now, the studies which we have been hitherto recommending, will prove so many wings by which he may raise himself, as it were, from the ground, and soar on high, when deficient of trying his strength this way, and producing something from his own hand. Invention is the finding out probable things, not only such as are adapted to the subject in hand, but such, besides, as by their sublimity and beauty are most capable of exciting suitable sentiments in the spectator, and of making him, when they happen to be well executed, fancy that it is the subject itself in its greatest perfection, and not a mere representation of it, that he has before him. We do not say true things, but probable things; because probability or verisimilitude is, in fact, the truth of those arts which have the fancy for their object. It is, indeed, the business and duty of both naturalists and historians to draw objects as they find them, and represent them with all their imperfections and blemishes, to which, as individuals, they are subject. But an ideal painter, and such alone is a true painter, resembles the poet: instead of copying, he imitates: that is, he works with his fancy, and represents objects endued with all that perfection which belongs to the species, and may be conceived in the archetype.\n\n\"Tis nature all, but nature methodis'd;\" says an eminent poet, speaking of poetry: And the same may be said of painting; it is nature methodized, and made perfect. Infomuch, that the circumstances of the action, exalted and sublime to the highest degree of beauty and boldness they are susceptible of, may, though possible, have never happened exactly such as the painter fancies and thinks proper to represent them. Thus, the piety of Æneas, and the anger of Achilles, are things to perfect in their kind, as to be merely probable. And it is for this reason that poetry, which is only another word for invention, is more philosophical, more instructive, and more entertaining, than history.\n\nHere it is proper to observe, what great advantages the ancient had over the modern painters. The history of the times they lived in, fraught with great and glorious events, was to them a rich mine of the most noble subjects, which, besides, often derived no small sublimity and pathos from the mythology upon which their religion was founded. So far were their gods from being immaterial, and placed at an infinite distance above their worshippers; so far was their religion from recommending humility, penance, and self-denial, that, on the contrary, it appeared calculated merely to flatter the senses, inflame the passions, and poison the fancy. By making the gods partake of our nature, and subjecting them to the same passions, it gave man hopes of being able to mix with those who, though greatly above him, resembled him, notwithstanding, in so many respects. Besides, those deities of theirs were in a manner visible, and to be met at every step. The sea was crowded with Tritons and Nereids, the rivers with Naiads, and the mountains with Dryads. The woods swarmed with Fauns and Nymphs, who, in their obscure retreats, sought an asylum for their stolen embraces. The most potent empires, the most noble families, the most celebrated heroes, all derived their pedigree from the greater divinities. Nay, gods interested themselves in all the concerns of mankind. Apollo, the god of long arrows, stood by the side of Hector in the fields of Troy, and inspired him with new strength and courage to batter down the walls and burn the ships of the Greeks. These, on the other hand, were led on to the fight and animated by Minerva, preceded by Terror, and followed by Death. Jove nods, his divine locks shake on his immortal head; Olympus trembles. With that countenance, which allays the tempest, and restores serenity to the heavens, he gathers kisses from the mouth of Venus, the delight of gods and of men. Among the ancients, every thing sported with the fancy; and in those works which depend entirely on the imagination, some of our greatest masters have thought they could not do better than borrow from the Pagans, if we may be allowed to say it, their pictures of Tartarus, in order to render their own drawings of hell more striking.\n\nAfter all, there have not been wanting able inventors in painting among the moderns. Michael Angelo, notwithstanding the depth and boldness of his own fancy, is not ashamed in some of his compositions, to Dante; as Phidias and Apelles may be said formerly to have Homérisé.\nInvention. Homerized. Raphael, too, tutored by the Greeks, has found means, like Virgil, to extract the quintessence of truth; has seasoned his works with grace and nobleness; and exalted nature, in a manner, above herself, by giving her an aspect more beautiful, more animating, and more sublime, than she is in reality accustomed to wear. In point of invention, Domencichino and Hannibal Caracci come very near Raphael, especially in the pieces painted by them in Rome; nor does Poussin fall very short of him in some of his pictures, particularly in his Esther before Ahasuerus, and his Death of Germanicus, the richest jewel belonging to the Barberine family. Of all the painters who have acquired any extraordinary degree of reputation, no one studied less to set off his pieces by bold and beautiful circumstances, or was more a stranger to what is called poetical perfection, than Jacopo Bassano. Among the numberless instances we could produce of his carelessness this way, let it suffice to mention a Preaching of St Paul painted by him in a place, near that of his birth, called Marofego. Instead of representing the apostle full of a divine enthusiasm, as Raphael has done, and thundering against the superstitions of the heathen in an assembly of Athenians; instead of exhibiting one of his auditors struck to the quick, another persuaded, a third inflamed; he makes him hold forth, in a village of the Venetian state, to a parcel of poor peasants and their wives, who take not the least notice of him; the women especially, who seem to mind nothing but the country labours in which he had found them employed.\n\nWith regard to invention, painting and poetry resemble each other so much in many other respects, besides that of combining in every action all the beauty and elegance it will admit, that they well deserve the name of sister arts. They differ, however, in one point, and that too of no small importance. It is this. The poet, in the representation of his story, relates what has already happened, prepares that which is still to come, and proceeds, step by step, through all the circumstances of the action; and, to produce the greater effect on his hearers, avails himself of the succession of time and place. The painter, on the contrary, deprived of such helps, must be content to depend upon one single moment. But what a moment! A moment, in which he may conjure up, at once, to the eyes of the spectator, a thousand objects; a moment, teeming with the most beautiful circumstances that can attend the action; a moment, equivalent to the successive labours of the poet. This the works of the greatest masters, which are everywhere to be seen, sufficiently evince: among others, the St Paul at Lystra, by Raphael, whom it is impossible not to praise as often as this picture is mentioned. In order to give the spectator a thorough insight into the subject of this piece, the painter has placed in the front of it the cripple already restored to his limbs by the apostle, fired with gratitude towards his benefactor, and exciting his countrymen to yield him all kinds of honour. Round the cripple are some figures lifting up the skirts of their coat, in order to look at the legs reduced to their proper shape, and acknowledging by gestures full of astonishment the reality of the miracle; an invention, says a certain author, a professed admirer of antiquity, which might have been proposed as an example in the happiest age of Greece.\n\nWe have another shining instance of the power of painting to introduce a greater variety of objects on the scene at the same time, and of the advantage it has in this respect over poetry, in a drawing by the celebrated La Fage. This drawing represents the descent of Æneas into hell. The field is the dark caverns of Pluto's kingdom, through the middle of which creeps slowly the muddy and melancholy Acheron. Nearly in the centre of the piece appears Æneas with the golden bough in his hand, and with an air of astonishment at what he sees. The Sibyl, who accompanies him, is answering the questions which he asks her. The personage there is the ferryman of the pitchy lake, by which even the gods themselves are afraid to swear. Those who, crowding in to the banks of the river, numberless as the leaves shaken off the trees by autumnal blasts, express, with outstretched hands, an impatience to be ferried to the opposite shore, are the unhappy names, who, for want of burial, are unqualified for that happiness. Charon, accordingly, is crying out to them, and with his lifted-up oar driving them from his boat, which has already taken in a number of those who had been honoured with the accustomed funeral rites. Behind Æneas and the Sibyl we discover a confused group of wretched souls, lamenting bitterly their misfortune in being denied a passage; two of them wrapped up in their clothes; and, in a fit of despair, funk upon a rock. Upon the first lines of the piece stands a third group of unhumbled shades. Leucaspes, Orontes, and, in the midst of them, the good old Palinurus, formerly master and pilot of the hero's own vessel, who with joined hands most earnestly desires to be taken along with him into the boat, that, after death, at least, he may find some repose, and his dead body no longer remain the sport of winds and waves. Thus, what we see scattered up and down in many verses by Virgil, is here, as it were, gathered into a focus, and concentrated by the ingenious pencil of the painter, so as to form a subject well worthy of being exposed, in more shapes than one, to the eyes of the public.\n\nWhen a painter takes a subject in hand, be it hifetical, be it fabulous, he should carefully peruse the books which treat of it, imprint well on his mind all the circumstances that attend it, the persons concerned in it, and the passions with which they must have been feverishly animated; not omitting the particulars of time and place. His next business is to create it, as it were, anew, observing the rules already laid down for that purpose: From what is true, choosing that which is most striking; and clothing his subject with such accessory circumstances and actions, as may render it more conspicuous, pathetic, and noble, and best display the powers of the inventive faculty. But, in doing this, great discretion is requisite; for, let his imagination grow ever so warm, his hand is never to execute any thing that is not fully approved by his judgment. Nothing low or vulgar should appear in a lofty and noble argument; a fault, of which some of the greatest masters, even Lampieri and Poussin, have been now and then guilty.\n\nThe action must be one, the place one, the time one. We need not lay any thing of those painters, who, like the writers of the Chinese and Spanish theatre, cram a variety of actions together, and to give us at once the whole life of a man. Such blunders, it is presumed, are too gross to be feared at present. The politeness\nInvention, politeness, and learning of the age seem to demand considerations of a more refined nature; such as, that the episodes introduced in the drama of a picture, the better to fill and adorn it, should be not only beautiful in themselves, but indispensably requisite. The games celebrated at the tomb of Anchises, in Sicily, have a greater variety in them, and more sources of delight, than those that had been before celebrated at the tomb of Patroclus under the walls of Troy. The arms forged by Vulcan for Æneas, if not better tempered, are at least better engraved, than those which the same god had forged several ages before for Achilles. Nevertheless, in the eyes of judges, both the games and the arms of Homer are more pleasing than those of Virgil, because the former are more necessary in the Iliad than the latter in the Æneid. Every part should agree with, and have a relation to, the whole. Unity should reign even in variety; for in this beauty consists. This is a fundamental maxim in all the arts whose object it is to imitate the works of nature.\n\nPictures often borrow no small grace and beauty from the fictions of poetry. Albani has left us, in several of his works, sufficient proofs of the great share the belles lettres had in refining his taste. But Raphael, above all others, may in this branch too be considered as a guide and matter. To give but one instance out of many; what a beautiful thought was it to represent the river himself, in a Paphage of Jordan, supporting his waters with his own hands, in order to open a way to the army of the Israelites! Nor has he displayed less judgement in reviving, in his designs engraved by Agostino of Venice, the little loves of Aëtius playing with the arms of Alexander, conquered by the beauty of Roxana.\n\nAmong the ancients, Apelles and Parhasius were those who distinguished themselves most in allegorical subjects, in which the inventive faculty shows itself to the greatest advantage; the first by his picture of Calumny*, the second by that of the Genius of the Athenians†. The ancient painter called Galaton gave likewise a fine proof of his genius in this branch, by representing a great number of poets greedily quenching their thirst in the waters gushing from the mouth of the sublime Homer. And to this allegory, according to Guigni, Pliny‡ has an eye, when he calls that Prince of poets the fountain of wits. But it is, after all, no way surprising that we should often meet such fine flights of fancy in the ancient artists. They were not guided in their works by a blind practice: they were men of polite education, conversant with the letters of the age in which they lived; and the companions rather than the servants of the great men who employed them. The finest allegorical painter among the moderns was Rubens; and he was accordingly much celebrated for it. The best critics, however, find fault with his uniting in the Luxemburg gallery, the queen-mother, in council, with two cardinals and Mercury. Nor is there less impropriety in his making Tritons and Nereids, in another piece of the same gallery, swim to the queen's veiled through the galleys of the knights of St Stephen. Such freedoms are equally disquieting with the prophecies of Samazano's Proteus, concerning the mystery of the incarnation, or the Indian kings of Camoens, reasoning with the Português on the adventures of Ulysses.\n\nThe best modern performances in picturesque allegory invention are certainly those of Poullin; who availed himself, with great discretion and judgement, of the vast treasures with which, by a close study of the ancients, he had enriched his memory. On the other hand, Le Brun, his countryman, has been very unhappy this way. Ambitious to have everything his own, instead of allegories, he has filled the gallery of Versailles with enigmas and riddles, of which none but himself was qualified to be the Oedipus. Allegory must be ingenious, it is true; but then it must be equally perspicuous; for which reason, a painter should avoid all vague and indeterminate allusions, and likewise those to history and heathen mythology, which are too arbitrary to be understood by the generality of spectators. The best way, perhaps, to symbolize moral and abstract things, is to represent particular events: as Caracci did, by advice of Monignon See Both-Aguicchi, in the Farnese palace. For example, what can better express a hero's love towards his country, than the virtuous Decius consecrating himself boldly to the infernal gods, in order to secure victory to his countrymen over their enemies? What finer emblems can we desire of emulation, and an insatiable thirst for glory, than Julius Cæsar weeping before the statue of Alexander in the temple of Hercules at Gades? of the inconstancy of fortune, than Marius sitting on the ruins of Carthage, and receiving, instead of the acclamations of an army joyfully saluting him imperator, orders from a dictator of Scipio to quit Africa? of indiscretion, than Candaules, who, by showing the naked beauties of his wife to his friend Gyges, kindled a passion that soon made him repent his folly? Such representations as these require no comment; they carry their explanations along with them. Besides, supposing, and it is the worst we can suppose, that the painter's aim in them should happen not to be understood, his piece would still give delight. It is thus that the fables of Ariosto prove so entertaining, even to those who understand nothing of the moral couched under them; and likewise the Enchanted, though all do not comprehend the allusions and double intent of the poet.\n\nSect. X. Of Disposition.\n\nSo much for invention. Disposition, which may be considered as a branch of invention, consists in the proper stationing of what the inventive faculty has imagined, so as to express the subject in the most lively manner. The chief merit of disposition may be said to consist in that disorder, which, wearing the appearance of mere chance, is in fact the most studied effect of art. A painter, therefore, is equally to avoid the dryness of those ancients who always planted their figures like so many couples in a procession, and the affectation of those moderns who jumble them together as if they were met merely to fight and squabble. In this branch Raphael was happy enough to choose the just medium, and attain perfection. The disposition of his figures is always exactly such as the subject requires. In the Battle of Constantine, they are confusedly cluttered with as much art, as they are regularly marshalled in Christ's commitment of the keys to St Peter, and constituting him prince of the apostles.\n\nLet the inferior figures of a piece be placed as they will, the principal figure should strike the eye most, and stand...\nstand out, as it were, from among the rest. This may be effected various ways, as by placing it on the foremost lines, or in some other conspicuous part of the piece; by exhibiting it, in a manner, by itself; by making the principal light fall upon it; by giving it the most resplendent drapery; or, indeed, by several of these methods, nay, by all of them together. For, being the hero of the picture's fable, it is but just that it should draw the eye to itself, and lord it, as it were, over all the other objects.\n\nAccording to Leon Batista Alberti, painters should follow the example of comic writers, who compose their fable of as few persons as possible. For, in fact, a crowded picture is apt to give as much pain to the spectator, as a crowded road to the traveller.\n\nSome subjects, it must be granted, require a number, nay, a nation, as it were, of figures. On these occasions, it depends entirely on the skill of the painter to dispose of them in such a manner, that the principal ones may always make the principal appearance; and contrive matters so that the piece be not overcrowded, or want convenient reliefs and pauses. He must, in a word, take care that his piece be full, but not charged. In this respect, the Battles of Alexander by Le Brun are masterpieces which can never be sufficiently studied; whereas nothing, on the other hand, can be more unhappy than the famous Paradise of Tintoret, which covers one entire side of the great council-chamber at Venice. It appears no better than a confused heap of figures, a swarm, a cloud, a chaos, which pains and fatigues the eye. What a pity it is, that he did not dispose this subject after a model of his own, now in the gallery of Bevilacqua at Verona! In this last the several choirs of martyrs, virgins, bishops, and other saints, are judiciously thrown into so many clusters, parted here and there by a fine fleece of clouds, so as to exhibit the innumerable host of heaven drawn up in a way that makes a most agreeable and glorious appearance. There goes a story, to our purpose, of a celebrated matter, who in a drawing of the Universal Deluge, the better to express the immensity of the waters that covered the earth, left a corner of his paper without figures. Being asked, if he did not intend to fill it up: No, said he; do not you see my leaving it empty is what precisely constitutes the picture?\n\nThe reason for breaking a composition into several groups is, that the eye, pausing freely from one object to another, may the better comprehend the whole. But the painter is not to stop here; for these groups are, besides, to be so artfully put together, as to form rich clusters, give the whole composition a singular air of grandeur, and afford the spectator an opportunity of discerning the piece at a distance, and taking the whole in, as it were, at a single glance. These effects are greatly promoted by a due regard to the nature of colours, so as not to place together those which are apt to pain by their opposition, or distract by their variety. They should be so judiciously disposed as to temper and qualify each other.\n\nA proper use of the chiaro-oscuro is likewise of great service on this occasion. The groups are easily parted, and the whole picture acquires a grand effect, by introducing some strong falls of shade, and, above all, one principal beam of light. This method has been followed with great success by Rembrandt in a famous picture of his, representing the Virgin at the foot of the cross on Mount Calvary; the principal light darting upon her through a break of the clouds, while the rest of the figures about her stand more or less in the shade. Tintoret, too, acquired great reputation, as well by that briskness with which he enlivened his figures, as by his masterly manner of shading them; and Polidoro de Caravaggio, though he scarcely painted anything but baflo-relievos, was particularly famous for introducing with great skill the effects of the chiaro-oscuro, a thing first attempted by Mantegna in his Triumph of Julius Caesar. It is by this means that his compositions appear so strikingly divided into different groups, and, among their other perfections, afford so much delight through the beautiful disposition that reigns in them.\n\nIn like manner, a painter, by the help of perspective, especially that called aerial, the opposition of local colours, and other contrivances which he may expect to hit upon by studying nature, and those who have best studied her before him, will be able not only to part his groups, but make them appear at different distances, so as to leave sufficient passages between them.\n\nBut the greatest caution is to be used in the pursuit of the methods here laid down; especially in the management of the chiaro-oscuro, that the effects attributed to light and shade, and to their various concomitants, may not run counter to truth and experience. This is a capital point. For this purpose, a painter would do well to make, in little figures, as Tintoret and Poussin used to do, a model of the subject that he intends to represent, and then illuminate it by lamp or candle-light. By this means he may come to know with certainty, if the chiaro-oscuro, which he has formed in his mind, does not clash with the reason of things. By varying the height and direction of his light, he may easily discover such accidental effects as are most likely to recommend his performance, and to establish a proper system for the illuminating it. Nor will he afterwards find it a difficult matter to modify the quality of his shades, by softening or strengthening them, according to the situation of his scene, and the quality of the light falling upon it. If it should happen to be a candle or lamp-light scene, he would then have nothing to do but consider his model well, and faithfully copy it.\n\nIn the next place, to turn a group elegantly, the best pattern is that of a bunch of grapes adopted by Titian. As, of the many grains that compose a bunch of grapes, some are struck directly by the light, and those opposite to them are in the shade, whilst the intermediate ones partake of both light and shade in a greater or lesser degree; so, according to Titian, the figures of a group should be so disposed, that, by the union of the chiaro-oscuro, several things may appear as it were but one thing. And in fact it is only from his having pursued this method, that we can account for the very grand effect of his pieces this way; in which it is impossible to study him too much.\n\nThe mannerists, who do not follow nature in the track of the masters just mentioned, are apt to commit many faults. The reason of their figures calling their shades in this or that manner seldom appears in the picture, or at least does not appear sufficiently probable. They are, besides, wont to trespass all bounds in slashing their pieces with light, that is, in enlivening those parts which we usually term the darks of a picture. This method,\nPart I.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nDiffusion—no doubt, has sometimes a very fine effect; but it is, however, to be used with no small discretion, as otherwise the whole loses that union, that pause, that majestic silence, as Caracci used to call it, which affords so much pleasure. The eye is not let's hurt by many lights scattered here and there over a picture, than the ear is by the confused noise of different persons speaking all together in an assembly.\n\nGuido Reni, who has imparted to his paintings that gaiety and splendor in which he lived, seems enamoured with a bright and open light; whereas Michael Angelo de Caravaggio, who was of a fulsome and savage disposition, appears fond of a gloomy and cloudy sky: so that neither of them were qualified to handle indifferently all objects. The chiaro-oscuro may likewise prove of great service to a painter in giving his composition a grand effect; but, nevertheless, the light he chooses must be adapted to the situation of the scene where the action is laid: nor would he be less faulty, who in a grotto or cavern, where the light enters by a chink, should make his shades soft and tender, than he who should represent them strong and bold in an open sky-light.\n\nBut this is by no means the only fault which mannerists are apt to be guilty of in historical pieces, and particularly in the disposition of their figures. To say nothing of their favourite group of a woman lying on the ground with one child at her breast, and another playing about her, and the like, which they generally place on the first lines of their pieces; nor of those half-figures in the background peeping out from the hollows contrived for them: they make a common practice of mixing naked with clothed figures; old men with young; placing one figure with its face towards you, and another with its back; they contrast violent motions with languid attitudes, and seem to aim at opposition in every thing; whereas oppositions never please, but when they arise naturally from the subject, like antitheses in a discourse.\n\nAs to foreshortened figures, too much affectation in using or avoiding them is equally blamable. The attitudes had better be composed than otherwise. It very seldom happens that there is any occasion for making them so impetuous as to be in danger of losing their equilibrium; a thing too much practised by some painters.\n\nIn regard to drapery, equal care should be taken to avoid that poverty, which makes some matters look as if, through mere penury, they grudged clothes to their figures; and that profusion which Albani imputed to Guido, saying, that he was rather a tailor than a painter. The ornaments of dress should be used with great sobriety; and it will not be amiss to remember what was once said to an ancient painter: \"I pity you greatly: unable to make Helen handsome, you have taken care to make her fine.\"\n\nLet the whole, in a word, and all the different parts of the disposition, possess probability, grace, costume, and the particular character of what is to be represented. Let nothing look like uniformity of manner; which does not appear less in the composition than it does in colouring, drapery, and design; and is, as it were, that kind of accent, by which painters may be as readily distinguished as foreigners are, by pronouncing in the same manner all the different languages they happen to be acquainted with.\n\nSect. XI. Of Illusion.\n\nAmong painters, and the writers on painting, there is one maxim universally admitted and continually inculcated; it is, that nature ought to be imitated, and objects are said to be represented naturally, when they have such relief that they may seem real. If we inquire to what degree painting may carry this illusion, we shall find that it deceives the eye, and obliges the spectator to employ the touch in mouldings and in bas-reliefs where they are a little projected; but that it is weakened, and the effect partly destroyed where the projection is one or two feet. It is possible also to make it in the highest degree complete in pictures of flowers, fruits, and other representations of still life, provided they be seen in a certain point of view, and at a considerable distance; but there is no example of a picture containing a number of figures, and placed in a proper light, being mistaken for real life. We are told, indeed, of a butt of an abbe painted by Charles Coypel, which, placed in a certain direction behind a table, and in a certain light, deceived several persons so completely as to induce them to fallute it: but, without admitting any thing very extraordinary in the projection or illusion of this painting, it is evident, from the circumstances attending the relation, that the deception arose from surprise and inattention, which might happen to a production of an inferior artist. And hence we may conclude that it is vain to pretend to perfect the illusion, especially in pictures consisting of a number of figures, and with considerable distances supposed between them.\n\nAmong the obstacles which are opposed to the perfection of this branch of the art, we shall chiefly attend to those which naturally proceed from our habits of thinking and judging on all occasions. These, together with the experience we daily have of light on all kinds of surfaces, and of all colours, are sufficient to demonstrate the want of reality in the mere representation of any scenes.\n\nIt has been elsewhere shewn, that distance, figure, and magnitude, are not naturally objects of perception by the senses of sight; that we judge of these things by the eye only, in consequence of associations early formed between the perceptions of touch and the corresponding impressions on the retina and optic nerve by the rays of light; and that a painter makes his picture resemble the original, merely by laying his colours on a plane surface in such a manner, as that they reflect the same rays of light with the convex or concave original, when the spectator stands at the proper distance (see Metaphysics, No. 49, 50, 51, 52, and 95.). But if this be admitted, illusion in painting can never be made perfect, on account of the inevitable fallacy of the shades which mark the most distant parts of the picture. The painter can only imitate those shades by obscure colours, laid on a plane surface, and susceptible of reflecting the light with a degree of force relative to the real distance. Now our eyes give us the true place of this surface, opposed to the idea of deepening which the painter wishes to produce, a contrariety which prevents the deception. On this account, the faults found in the works of the greatest...\ngreatest matters, with regard to the effects produced by the whole, most frequently relate to their manner of shading, which is sufficient to prove, that the want of illusion in painting depends chiefly on the imperfection of the shades.\n\nThis defect, though it cannot be wholly avoided, may yet be rendered less perceptible. There has yet, indeed, been no painter able to imitate shadow, nor is it probable that any one will ever perfectly accomplish his task. Shadow in nature is not a body, but the privation of light, which destroys colours in a greater or less degree, in proportion as it is more or less complete. Now the painter can only imitate this privation and real darkness, by colours which must from their very nature be capable of reflecting light.—The colours may be more or less obscure, but they prefer always something which gives a mixture of reflection. To carry the imitation of shadow to the highest degree of perfection, it would be necessary to apply a colour capable of darkening all others, more or less as there should be occasion, and which might have no visible trace of its existence, that is, no one part of it which reflected one coloured ray more strongly than another. Perhaps this kind of negative colour might be found in practice to be of service to the art; but it would not render the surface totally invisible, for it would be necessary, farther, that it should have the property of not reflecting a single ray of light when exposed to it; which is altogether impossible, as there is no colour or body in nature without reflection in such a situation.\n\nWe shall be further convinced of the impossibility of painting shadow, if we attend to the pictures of the greatest masters, with regard to the imitation of truth. Every part, when taken by itself, connected with light, or with deminutiae, presents a perfect imitation. Even the different degrees of light or the objects are sufficiently exact; but notwithstanding this appearance of circumstances corresponding with truth, and of which the result should be perfect illusion, yet in considering the whole, we are never so completely deceived, as to take a picture for a reality; from which we may conclude, that the want of illusion proceeds almost entirely from the imperfection of shading.\n\nIllusion then, in the strictest sense, cannot exist in painting; but there is another kind of illusion, perhaps improperly so called, which is one of the principal parts of the art, and worthy of the greatest attention: It is, that the picture shall resemble truth to such a degree, by the justness of its forms, by the combination of colours, and by all its general effects, that the image shall give all the pleasure to be expected from the imitation of truth. This is not illusion in the proper sense of the word, since it exists as well in pictures on a small scale as in those of equal dimensions with the original; but it is that truth of imitation of which painting is susceptible, even in pictures containing any numbers of figures at any reasonable distance from each other.\n\nBut it remains to be considered whether this imitation of truth, taken by itself, be the highest attainable perfection in painting. It is generally granted, that the greatest beauty is that which not only pleases at first view, but on the nearest and most critical examination. But if illusion, such as we have described it, were the sole merit of the art, it would follow, that the person who was least acquainted with its beauties would experience the same pleasure as he who had studied them most. Further, in examining the works of the greatest matters, it is easy to perceive, that it is not their illusion which has excited the attention and admiration of the critic. Even the works of the divine Raphael do not deceive the eye in any point of view more completely than those of an ordinary painter. Raphael, pure in his character and design, is, without doubt, very deficient in this part of the art. Meanwhile the grandeur of his ideas in composition, and the choice of his forms; the beauty of his heads, wherein one does not admire simply the imitation of any known truth; his ingenious and noble manner in drapery, which yet does not resemble any known stuff, or the garb of any nation; in short, all his beauties are superior to the simple imitation of truth, and contradict the sentiment of the greatest pleasure arising from illusion.\n\nIf we pass to those who have pursued colouring with the greatest success, we shall find them, doubtless, approach nearer to illusion than those who have neglected it; and it is also a fact, that their works have been more universally admired.\n\nAt the same time it is not the illusion occasioned by colours which has altogether excited this admiration. The exquisite deminutiae and the fineness of Corregio and Titian, which excel the ordinary beauties of nature, and even imitate her most perfect productions, may perhaps not be considered as destroying illusion; but it is no less a fact, that weaker and less precious colouring would carry it to greater perfection. Besides, this large, easy, and exquisite manner of painting, this harmony, of which they have given us the best examples, are owing to qualities in them much more excellent than what would be sufficient to produce the simple imitation of truth. Guido, Cortona, and some others, appear to approach nearer to illusion. But even these matters prove by their works, that the most estimable beauties in painting do not all tend to this branch of the art; for notwithstanding the high character which they have gained, they are much inferior to Raphael, Corregio, and Titian, although the first failed in colouring and in the knowledge of the claro-obscuro, the second in point of correctness, and the third in the choice of noble subjects.\n\nFrom this we may conclude, that the nearest resemblance to truth is not the sole object in painting; that it requires a superior degree of elevation by the art of adding beauty and perfection to the most exact resemblance; and that it is this art which distinguishes and characterizes extraordinary men.\n\nIf we run over the great branches of painting, we shall find a number of essential beauties different from those which are capable of carrying illusion to the greatest possible height. In composition, we principally admire the extent of genius, the choice of picturesque and graceful attitudes, the ingenious combination of groups, whether in uniting the light and shade in order to obtain the greatest effect, or in disposing a whole in such a manner as to make no part superfluous; and finally, that kind of practical talent by which the mind takes possession of nature, and forces it to produce all the beauties of which the art is susceptible. In this enumeration of particulars it is easy to perceive that the beauties of composition are very distant from those of illusion.\nTo obtain illusion in design, there is no occasion for correctness nor taste beyond what is perceived in nature by the most ignorant spectator. And with regard to colouring, that is not always most admired which is most natural. What departs widely from truth, indeed, is not of consequence beautiful, but many qualities are required besides the simple imitation of truth. Transparency, ease, and transparency in certain tones, are deemed absolutely requisite; and the most esteemed colourists have carried their beauties in all these respects beyond what they have seen in nature. If some tones in the fleshly parts have approached towards vermilion, to a light-blue, or a silver-gray, they have made them more apparent; not only to point them out to the spectator, but to show their knowledge in the discovery and their art in painting them. This would have been going beyond the limits of perfection, if these had consisted in simple illusion.\n\nThe opposition of colour, of light, and of shade, would have been in this case also superfluous; for nature is always true, without any pointed attempt to make her more engaging. The suppression of certain lights, which truth would require, and which art extinguishes, in order to augment the harmony of effect, would be also worthy of censure, whatever pleasure would result from it.\n\nFinally, one of the greatest beauties of the art, namely, the peculiar manner of a great master, has no relation to illusion. This is not even founded in nature, but depends on the genius or singularity of the artist. It is this manner which distinguishes the original of a great master from the most exact copy; and which characterizes the talents of the artists so well, that the smallest part of the picture, and even the least interesting, is sufficient to discover the painter. The distinction between the beautiful and illusive in painting has made Sir Joshua Reynolds, in express terms, recommend a perfection superior to the imitation of nature. \"The principle now laid down (says he), that the perfection of the art does not consist in mere imitation, is far from being new or singular. It is, indeed, supported by the general opinion of the enlightened part of mankind. The poets, orators, and rhetoricians of antiquity, are continually enforcing this position, that all the arts receive their perfection from an ideal beauty, superior to what is to be found in individual nature. They are ever referring to the practice of the painters and sculptors of their times, particularly Phidias the favourite artist of antiquity, to illustrate their assertions. As if they could not sufficiently express their admiration of his genius by what they knew, they have recourse to poetical enthusiasm. They call it inspiration; a gift from heaven. The artist is supposed to have ascended the celestial regions to furnish his mind with this perfect idea of beauty. 'He (says Proclus) who takes for his model such forms as nature produces, and confines himself to an exact imitation of them, will never attain to what is perfectly beautiful. For the works of nature are full of disproportion, and fall short of the true standard of beauty. So that Phidias, when he formed his Jupiter, did not copy any object ever presented to his sight; but contemplated only that image which he had conceived in his mind from Homer's description.'\n\n\"It is not easy to define in what this great style consists, nor to describe by words the proper means of acquiring it, if the mind of the student should be at all capable of such an acquisition. Could we teach taste or genius by rules, they would be no longer taste and genius. But though there neither are nor can be any precise invariable rules for the exercise or the acquisition of these great qualities; yet we may truly say that they always operate in proportion to our attention in observing the works of nature, to our skill in selecting, and to our care in digesting, modifying, and comparing our observations. There are many beauties in our art that seem at first to lie without the reach of precept, and yet may easily be reduced to practical principles. Experience is all in all; but it is not every one that profits by experience: and most people err not so much from want of capacity to find their object, as from not knowing what object to pursue. This great ideal perfection and beauty are not to be sought in the heavens, but upon the earth. They are about us, and upon every side of us: But the power of discovering what is deformed in nature, or, in other words, what is particular or uncommon, can be acquired only by experience; and the whole beauty and grandeur of the art consists in being able to get above all singular forms, local customs, particularities, and details of every kind.\"\n\nAfter these opinions, however, derived from the practice of the art, and this high authority, it may not be improper to hazard a few observations. Although illusion can be distinguished from many of the most excellent parts of the art taken separately, yet it does not follow that it shall not add in every picture to the beauty of the whole. It is impossible to state it in opposition to design, to composition, to colouring, or to the peculiar manner of a great artist; because all these may exist where there also exists the most perfect illusion. This is evident from the works of art which have real relief, and which at the same time are capable of perfection in all those branches, and of showing the peculiar manner of the artist. Again, it appears evident, that illusion, properly so called, should be a proper object of attention in painting. We may rate the ideal beauty very high, and with great justice; but it still consists in overcoming the defects in individual objects in nature, and not in departing from the truth of representation. And perhaps it may be alleged, that the impossibility of giving perfect illusion on a plane surface has pushed the greatest masters too far, and made them crowd artificial beauties into their pictures to conceal their want of power to give real ones. It is not improbable that on this very account the art is less perfect than otherwise it might have been: For in all subjects thought to be impossible, there is not only great room for exertion, but the person carries the art to greater perfection as he comes nearer to show that it may not be impossible. And if the works of Raphael, in point of illusion, are not superior to an ordinary artist, we may be permitted to say that there is great room for improvement in this branch.\n\nSect. XII. Of the Costume.\n\nThe costume in painting corresponds with the unities of time, place, and action, in tragedy and in epic poetry. It is chiefly confined to history painting; and regards the customs of different periods, the manners, the dress, and the colour, of different nations. Great exactness in the costume is scarcely practicable; but too sensible a departure\ndeparture from it denotes unpardonable negligence. It frequently happens that a piece composed or picturesque figures derives considerable advantage from certain liberties which are calculated to please both the artist and the spectator; for the judges of painting are not habitually occupied with the details of ancient and modern history, or profoundly versed in all the circumstances which make a departure from the costume conspicuous.\n\nOn the other hand, if they were so ignorant as not to understand, or so indifferent as not to regard those circumstances, this branch of the art would be altogether arbitrary. The road of the painter is between these two extremes, not to despise beauty on the one hand, nor probability on the other. But in pursuing this part of the art, it is in vain to seek for perfect models in ancient or modern painting.\n\n\"When Raphael in his cartoons introduces monks and Swift's guards; when he puts into a boat more figures than it is evident the boat could actually contain; when in the chafelment of Heliodorus, who attempted to despoil the temple of Jerusalem, Pope Julius II. is depicted as being present; when, in the donation of Constantine in the Vatican, a naked boy is placed conspicuous in the foreground, astride upon a dog, in the immediate presence of the pope and the emperor; when Venetian senators are introduced while Pope Alexander excommunicates Barbarossa; when Aristotle, Plato, Dante, and Petrarch, are brought together in the school of Athens, to omit the lesser improprieties of those apostles, &c.—every person must acknowledge that such offences as these against truths so obvious, if they do not arise from a defect of understanding, are instances of inexcusable carelessness.\n\n\"In like manner, when the same great master paints the dreams of Joseph and his fellow-prisoners in circles over their heads; when similar contrivances to express future events are used by Albani, Pameggiano, and Fuseli—is it not evident that no possibility can make the fiction true; and that real and feigned existences are unnaturally introduced in one narration?\n\n\"When Polydore chooses to represent the death of Cato, and exposes to the spectator the hero of the piece with his bowels gushing out; when Paul Veronese, at a banquet painted with his usual magnificence, places before us a dog gnawing a bone, and a boy making water: however such disgusting circumstances may be forgiven in the chef-d'œuvre of a Michael Angelo, had he represented these instead of the horrible figures of his Day of Judgement, the performance of an inferior artist cannot atone for them.\n\n\"So also, when one of the first rate among the modern painters, we mean Paul Veronese, introduces Benedictine monks at the marriage of Cana; when, in a picture of the crucifixion, he puts the Roman soldiers in the jerkins of the 16th century, and adorns their heads with turbans; when Guido, in a painting of Jesus appearing to his mother after his resurrection, places St Charles Borromeo in a kind of desk in the back-ground as witness to the interview; when Tintoret, at the miraculous fall of manna, arms the Israelites with staves; and Corregio appoints St Jerome as the instructor of the child Jesus—common sense revolts at the impropriety; and we are compelled to exclaim, Quicquid offendit mihi fac, incredulus odi!\n\n\"The mythological taste of the learned Poussin is well known; but Rubens seems to claim the merit of costume, having presented to the world a still greater number of suprene absurdities in this learned style: nor is it easy to conceive a more heterogeneous mixture of circumstances, real and imaginary, sacred and profane, than the Luxembourg gallery, and the other works of that great master, perpetually exhibit.\n\n\"When so great an authority as Sir Joshua Reynolds* contends for the rejection of common sense in favour of something he terms a higher sense; when he laments, indirectly, that art is not in such high estimation with us, as to induce the generals, lawgivers, and kings of modern times, to suffer themselves to be represented naked, as in the days of ancient Greece; when he defends even the ridiculous aberrations from possibility, which the extravagant pencil of Rubens has so plentifully produced—it is not surprising that the artists of the present day should be led to reject the company of common sense; or that Sir Joshua's performances should furnish examples of his own precepts.\n\n\"Mrs Siddons is represented by Sir Joshua in the character (as it is said) of the tragic muse: She is placed in an old-fashioned arm chair; this arm chair is supported by clouds, suspended in the air; on each side of her head is a figure not unapt to suggest the idea of the attendant muses of an enchantress: of these figures, one is supposed to represent Comedy, and the other Tragedy; Mrs Siddons herself is decently attired in the fashionable habiliments of 22 or 30 years ago.\n\n\"If this be a picture of the tragic muse, she ought not to appear in a modern dress, nor ought she to be seated in an old arm chair. If this be a portraiture of Mrs Siddons, she has no business in the clouds, nor has she any thing to do with aerial attendants. If this be Mrs Siddons in the character of the tragic muse, the first set of objections apply; for she is placed in a situation where Mrs Siddons could never be.\n\n\"In the death of Dido, Sir Joshua Reynolds introduces her sister, lamenting over the corpse of the unfortunate queen. This is possible; but he has also introduced Atropos cutting Dido's hair with a pair of scissors, a being equally real and apparent in the painting with Dido or her sister. This (continues our author) appears to me a gross offence against mythological probability; nor is it the only offence against the costume with which that picture is chargeable.\n\n\"There is one other breach of the costume, however common among painters, more gross and offensive than any of the instances hitherto alleged; we mean the perpetual and unnecessary display of the naked figure. We shall not stay to inquire whether more skill can be shown in painting the human body clothed or unclothed. If the personages introduced in any picture are more naked in the representation than can be justified by the probability of the times, persons, places, or circumstances, it is a breach of the costume proportionate to the deviation. This fault, however, is so common as hardly to be noticed; so slight indeed, when compared with that general taste for voluptuous imagery and obscene representation, which has so long disgraced the art of painting in every stage of its progress, that science and morality are culpable to the slightest offence.\n\n\"This depravity of imagination, this prostitution of the pencil to the base purposes of lascivious inclination, was a subject of much complaint among the ancients.\"\nNor is there less reason to complain in modern times, that this delightful art, which might be employed in exciting the noblest sentiments, and become subservient to the best interests of society, should so often be exercised upon subjects solely calculated to please the eye of the voluptuary and debauchee. It is hardly possible to pass through any admired collection without meeting with some of these; of which, however excellent the performance may be, the common feelings of decency and morality (if we are neither professed artists nor connoisseurs) prevent us from viewing them without a mixture of difficulty.\n\nEt pudor avertos texit velarium vultus*.\n\nIt is impossible to express how much a picture suffers by such loofenets of fancy, and finks as a bastard of the art in the esteem of good judges. Some people, indeed, are of opinion, that so scrupulous an observance of the costume is apt to hurt pictures, by depriving them of a certain air of truth, arising, they think, from those features and habits to which we are accustomed; and which are therefore apt to make a greater impression, than can be expected from things drawn from the remote sources of antiquity; adding withal, that a certain degree of licence has ever been allowed those artists who in their works must make fancy their chief guide. See, say they, the Greeks; that is, the masters of Raphael and Poussin themselves. Do they ever trouble their heads about such niceties? The Rhodian statuaries, for example, have not scrupled to represent Laocoon naked; that is, the priest of Apollo naked in the very act of sacrificing to the gods, and that too in presence of a whole people, of the virgins and matrons of Ilium. Now, continue they, if it was allowable in the ancient statuaries to neglect probability and decency to such a degree, to have a better opportunity of displaying their skill in the anatomy of the human body; why may it not be allowable in modern painters, the better to attain the end of their art, which is deception, to depart now and then a little from the ancient manners and the too rigorous laws of the costume? But these reasons, we beg leave to observe, are more absurd than they are ingenious. What! are we to draw conclusions from an example, which, far from deciding the dispute, gives occasion to another? The learned are of opinion, that those Rhodian masters would have done much better had they looked out for a subject in which, without offending so much against truth, and even probability, they might have had an equal opportunity of displaying their knowledge of the naked. And certainly no authority or example whatever should tempt us to do anything contrary to what both decency and the reason of things require, unless we intend, like Carpi, to represent\n\nSogni d'infermi, è fole di romanza.\n\nThe dreams of sick men, and the tales of fools.\n\nNo: a painter, the better to attain the end of his art, which is deception, ought carefully to avoid mixing the antique with the modern, the domestic with the foreign; things, in short, repugnant to each other, and therefore incapable of gaining credit. A spectator will never be brought to consider himself as actually present at the scene, the representation of which he has before him, unless the circumstances which enter it perfectly agree among themselves, and the field of action, if we may use the expression, in no shape belies the action itself. For instance, the circumstances, or, if you please, the accessories, in a Finding of Moses, are not, surely, to represent the borders of a canal planted with rows of poppies, and covered with country-houses in the European taste; but the banks of a great river shaded with clusters of palm trees, with a Sphinx or an Anubis in the adjacent fields, and here and there in the back-ground a towering pyramid. And indeed the painter, before he takes either canvas or paper in hand, should, on the wings of fancy, transport himself to Egypt, to Thebes, or to Rome; and summoning to his imagination the physiognomy, the dress, the plants, the buildings, suitable to his subject, with the particular spot where he has chosen to lay his scene, so manage his pencil, as, by the magic of it, to make the enraptured spectators fancy themselves there along with him.\n\nSect. XIII. Of proper Books for a Painter.\n\nFrom what has been already said, it may be easily gathered, that a painter should be neither illiterate nor unprovided with books. Many are apt to imagine, that the Iconologia of Ripa, or some such collection, is alone sufficient for this purpose, and that all the apparatus he stands in need of, may be reduced to a few casts of the remains of antiquity, or rather to what Rembrandt used to call his antiquities, being nothing more than coats of mail, turbans, threads of stuff, and all manner of old household trumpery and wearing apparel. Such things, no doubt, are necessary to a painter, and perhaps enough for one who wants only to paint half-lengths, or is willing to confine himself to a few low subjects. But they Argaristi are by no means sufficient for him who would fear high painting; for a painter who would attempt the Universe, and represent it in all its parts, such as it would appear, had not matter proved refractory to the intentions of the foreign Artist. Such a painter alone is a true, an universal, a perfect painter.—No mortal, indeed, must ever expect to rise to that sublimity; yet all should aspire to it, on the pain of otherwise ever continuing at a very mortifying distance from it: as the orator, who wishes to make a figure in his profession, should propose to himself no less a pattern than that perfect orator described by Tully; nor the courtier, than that perfect courtier delineated by Caetiglione. It cannot, therefore, appear surprising, if we insist on the propriety of reckoning a good collection of books as part of such a painter's implements. The Bible, the Greek and Roman historians, the works of Homer, that prince of poets, and of Virgil, are the most classical. To these let him add the Metamorphoses of Ovid, some of our best poets, the voyage of Paulanias, Vinci, Vafari, and others, upon painting.\n\nIt will also be of considerable advantage to him to have a well-chosen collection of drawings by the best masters (d), in order to trace the progress and history of\n\n(d) We have formerly (see History of Anatomy), mentioned a great anatomical work carrying on by Andrew\nof his art, and make himself acquainted with the various styles of painting which have been, and now are, in the greatest vogue. The prince of the Roman school was not ashamed to hang up in his study the drawings of Albert Durer; and spared no pains or expense to acquire all the drawings he could meet with that were taken from bas-reliefs; things which the art of engraving has since rendered so common as to be in every one's hands. This art of multiplying drawings by means of the graver, is of the same date, and boasts the same advantages, with the art of printing, by means of which the works of the mind are multiplied, as it were, at one stroke, and dispersed over the whole world.\n\nThe sight of fine subjects treated by able masters, and the different forms which the same subjects assume in different hands, cannot fail both of enlightening and inflaming the mind of the young painter. The same may be said of the perusal of good poets and historians, with the particulars and proofs of what they advance; not to mention those ideas and flights of invention, with which the former are wont to clothe, beautify, and exalt everything they take in hand. Bouchardon, after reading Homer, conceived, to use his own words, that men were three times taller than before, and that the world was enlarged in every respect. It is very probable, that the beautiful thought of covering Agamemnon's face with the skirt of his mantle at the sacrifice of Iphigenia, was suggested to Timantes by the tragedy of Euripides. And the sublime conceit of Raphael, who, in a Creation of his, represents God in the immense space, with one hand reaching to the sun and the other to the moon, may be considered as the child of the following words of the Psalmist: *The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handy-work.*\n\nThis thought of Raphael has been, indeed, censured by Mr Webb. \"A God (says this gentleman), extending one hand to the sun, and another to the moon, destroys that idea of immensity which should accompany the work of creation, by reducing it to a world of a few inches.\" But the opinion of Count Algarotti is very different. \"For my part, (says that elegant critic,) I cannot discover in this painting a world of a few inches, but a world on a much greater scale; a world of millions and millions of miles: and yet this immense world, by means of that act of the Godhead, in which with one hand he reaches to the sun, and with the other to the moon, shrinks, in my imagination, to a mere nothing, in respect to the immensity of God himself; which is all that the powers of painting can pretend to. This invention is, though in a contrary sense, of the same kind with that of Timantes, who, to express the enormous size of a sleeping Polyphemus, placed round him some satyrs measuring the monster's thumb with a thyrsus. Hence Pliny, who relates the fact, takes occasion to tell us, that his works always imply more than they express; and that how great soever he may be in execution, he is still greater in invention: *Atque in omnibus ejus operibus intelligitur plus semper quam pingitur*.\"\n\nAndrew Bell, Esq. in Edinburgh, of the figures of which, as they are engraved under the inspection of so able an anatomist as Mr Fyfe, and with the approbation of Dr Monro, we may at least form a favourable opinion; and if well executed, of which there can be but little doubt, they will unquestionably be of essential service to the painter.\nPart I.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nPainter's part of the piece. Coriolanus, hastily descending from his tribunal, and hurried on by filial affection, to embrace his mother, flops short through shame, on her crying out to him. Hold! let me first know, if it is a son, or an enemy, I am going to embrace? Thus a painter may impart novelty to the most hackneyed subject, by taking for his guides those authors who possess the happy talent of adding grace and dignity, by their beautiful and sublime descriptions, even to the most common and trifling transactions.\n\nSect. XIV. Of the Painter's Balance.\n\nThe celebrated De Piles, who by his writings has thrown so much light upon painting, in order to assist young painters in forming a right judgement of those masters who hold the first rank in the profession, and to reduce such judgement to the greater precision, be thought himself of a pictorial balance, by means of which a painter's merit may be weighed with the greatest exactness. This merit he divides into Composition, Design, Colouring, and Expression; and in each of these branches he has assigned to every painter that share to which he thought him intitled, according as he approached more or less the highest degree of excellence and summit of perfection; so that, by summing up the numbers which, standing against each master's name, express his share of merit in each of these branches, we have his total merit or value in the art, and may hence gather what rank one painter holds in regard to another. Several objections, it is true, have been started to this method of calculation, by a famous mathematician of our days, who, among other things, infers, that it is the product of the above numbers multiplied by each other, and not the sum of them, that gives the merit of the artist. But this is not a place to enter into such niceties, nor indeed would the doing of it be of any service to the art. The only thing worth our notice is, whether the original numbers, standing for the painter's merit in the several branches of his art, are such as he is really intitled to, without suffering ourselves to be baffled by any partiality, as De Piles has been, in favour of the prince of the Flemish school; the consequence of which, strange as it may appear, is, that in his balance Raphael and Rubens exactly turn out of the same weight.\n\nThe idea of the painter's balance is doubtless curious, and therefore deserves to be mentioned; but as the merits of the most eminent painters have been already appreciated under the second section of the historical part of our article, to which we refer, it is needless to be more particular here, or to repeat what has been already treated of at sufficient length.\n\nSect. XV. Practical Observations.\n\nHaving thus laid down the principles of the art, and ventured to give the student some directions with regard to his studies, we shall conclude this part of the subject with a few observations relative wholly to practice.\n\nAnd, 1. The young painter must be careful not to be led astray by the ambition of composing easily, or attaining what is called a majestic handling of the chalk or the pencil; a pernicious attempt, by which students are excluded from all power of advancing in real excellence. To this attempt, however, young men have not only the frivolous ambition of being thought masterly, inciting them on the one hand, but also their natural sloth tempting them on the other. They are terrified at the prospect before them, and of the toil required to obtain exactness; whilst the lives of the most eminent painters furnish us with examples of the most unceasing industry. When they conceived a subject, they first made a variety of sketches; then a finished drawing of the whole; after that a more correct drawing of every separate part, heads, hands, feet, and pieces of drapery; they then painted the picture, and after all retouched it from the life. The pictures thus wrought with such care, now appear like the effects of enchantment, and as if some mighty genius had struck them off at a blow.\n\nBut a student is not always advancing because he is employed; he must apply his strength to that part of the art where the real difficulties lie; to that part which distinguishes it as a liberal art, and not by mistaken industry lose his time in that which is merely ornamental. The students, instead of vying with each other who shall have the readiest hand, should be taught to labour who shall have the purest and most correct outline; instead of striving who shall produce the brightest tint, or endeavouring to give the glost of stuffs so as to make them appear real, let their ambition be directed to contend, who shall dispose his drapery in the most graceful folds, and give the greatest dignity to the human form.\n\nHe who endeavours to copy accurately the figure before him, not only acquires a habit of exactness and precision, but is continually advancing in his knowledge of the human figure; and though he seems to superficial observers to make a slower progress, he will be found at last capable of adding (without running into capricious wildness) that grace and beauty which is necessary to be given to his more finished works, and which cannot be got by the moderns, as it was not acquired by the ancients, but by an attentive and well-directed study of the human form.\n\n2. It is, in the next place, a matter of great importance, that the drawings on which the young artist first exercises his talents be of the most excellent kind. Let the profiles, the hands, and the feet given him to copy, be of the best masters, so as to bring his eye and his hand early acquainted with the most elegant forms and the most beautiful proportions. A painter who has early acquired a fine taste, finds it an easy matter to give dignity to the meanest features, while even the works of a Praxiteles or a Glycon are seen to suffer in the hands of another. A veil will ever retain the scent which it has first contracted.\n\n3. It would be proper also to make the pupil copy some fine heads from the Greek and Roman medals; not so much for the reason just laid down, as to make him acquainted, if we may use the expression, with those personages which in time he may have occasion to introduce into his pieces, and, above all, to improve him early in the art of copying from relief. Hence he will learn the rationale of light and shade, and the nature of that chiaro scuro by which it is, properly speaking, that the various forms of things are distinguished.\n\nThere is no danger of studying too much the works\nPractical of the greatest matters, either in painting or sculpture; but how they may be studied to advantage is an inquiry of great importance. \"Some (says Sir Joshua Reynolds), who have never raised their minds to the consideration of the real dignity of the art, and who rate the works of an artist in proportion as they excel or are defective in the mechanical parts, look on theory as something that may enable them to talk, but not to paint better; and, confining themselves entirely to mechanical practice, very industriously toil in the drudgery of copying, and think they make a rapid progress, while they faithfully exhibit the minutest part of a favourite picture. This appears to me a very tedious, and, I think, a very erroneous method of proceeding. Of every large composition, even of those which are most admired, a great part may be truly said to be common place. This, though it takes up much time in copying, conduces little to improvement. I consider general copying as a defective kind of industry: the student satisfies himself with the appearance of doing something; he falls into the dangerous habit of imitating without selecting, and of labouring without any determinate object: as it requires no effort of the mind, he sleeps over his work; and those powers of invention and composition which ought particularly to be called out, and put in action, lie torpid, and lose their energy for want of exercise.\n\n\"However, as the practice of copying is not entirely to be excluded, since the mechanical practice of painting is learned in some measure by it, let those choice parts only be selected which have recommended the work to notice. If its excellence consists in its general effect, it will be proper to make slight sketches of the machinery and general management of the picture. Those sketches should be kept always by you, for the regulation of your style. Instead of copying the touches of those great masters, copy only their conceptions. Instead of treading in their footsteps, endeavour only to keep the same road. Labour to invent on their general principles and way of thinking. Possess yourself with their spirit. Consider with yourself how a Michael Angelo or a Raphael would have treated this subject, and work yourself into a belief that your picture is to be seen and criticised by them when completed. Even an attempt of this kind will rouse your powers.\"\n\nPart II. Of the Different Classes of Painting.\n\nSect. I. General Enumeration.\n\nAs all the objects in nature are susceptible of imitation by the pencil, the matters of this art have applied themselves to different subjects, each one as his talents, his taste, or inclination may have led him.—From whence have arisen the following classes.\n\nI. History painting; which represents the principal events in history sacred and profane, real or fabulous; and to this class belongs allegorical expression. These are the most sublime productions of the art; and in which Raphael, Guido, Rubens, Le Brun, &c. have excelled.\n\nII. Rural history; or the representation of a country life, of villages and hamlets, and their inhabitants. This is an inferior class; and in which Teniers, Breughel, Watteau, &c. have great reputation, by rendering it at once pleasing and graceful.\n\nIII. Portrait painting; which is an admirable branch of this art, and has engaged the attention of the greatest masters in all ages, as Apelles, Guido, Van-dyke, Rembrandt, Regauds, Pefne, Kneller, La Tour, &c.\n\nIV. Grotesque histories; as the nocturnal meetings of witches, sorceries and incantations; the operations of mountebanks, &c. a sort of painting in which the younger Breughel, Teniers, and others, have exercised their talents with success.\n\nV. Battle\nV. Battle-pieces; by which Huchtemberg, Wouvermans, &c. have rendered themselves famous.\n\nVI. Landscapes; a charming species of painting, that has been treated by masters of the greatest genius in every nation.\n\nVII. Landscapes diversified with waters, as rivers, lakes, cataracts, &c.; which require a peculiar talent, to express the water sometimes smooth and transparent, and at others foaming and rushing furiously along.\n\nVIII. Sea pieces; in which are represented the ocean, harbours, and great rivers; and the vessels, boats, barges, &c., with which they are covered; sometimes in a calm, sometimes with a fresh breeze, and at others in a storm. In this class Backhuyzen, Vandervelde, Blome, and many others, have acquired great reputation.\n\nIX. Night pieces; which represent all sorts of objects, either as illuminated by torches, by the flames of a conflagration, or by the light of the moon. Schalk, Vandermeer, Vanderpool, &c., have here excelled.\n\nX. Living Animals: A more difficult branch of painting than is commonly imagined; and in which Roef, Carre, Vandervelde, and many others, have succeeded marvellously well.\n\nXI. Birds of all kinds; a very laborious species, and which requires extreme patience minutely to express the infinite variety and delicacy of their plumage.\n\nXII. Culinary pieces; which represent all sorts of provisions, and animals without life, &c. A species much inferior to the rest, in which nature never appears to advantage, and which requires only a servile imitation of objects that are but little pleasing. The painting of fishes is naturally referred to this class.\n\nXIII. Fruit pieces, of every kind, imitated from nature.\n\nXIV. Flower pieces; a charming class of painting, where Art in the hands of Huysum, P. Segerts, Merian, &c., becomes the rival of Nature. Plants and insects are usually referred to the painters of flowers, who with them ornament their works.\n\nXV. Pieces of architecture; a kind of painting in which the Italians excel all others. Under this class may be comprehended the representations of ruins, seaports, streets, and public places; such are seen in the works of Caneletti, and other able masters.\n\nXVI. Instruments of music, pieces of furniture, and other inanimate objects; a trifling species, and in which able painters only accidentally employ their talents.\n\nXVII. Imitations of bas-reliefs; a very pleasing kind of painting, and which may be carried by an able hand to a high degree of excellence.\n\nXVIII. Hunting pieces; these also require a peculiar talent, as they unite the painting of men, horses, dogs, and game, to that of landscapes.\n\nIt will not be expected that we should here give the rules that the painter is to observe in handling each particular subject. What has been said on historical painting (Part I.) may throw some light on the rest, and the particular rules must be learned from the study of the art itself. Good masters, academies of reputation, and a rational practice, are the sources from whence the young painter must derive the detail of his art. We shall however insert some rules and observations relative to Landscape and Portrait; these, with History painting Landscapes (already pretty fully treated), forming the principal branches of the art.\n\nSect. II. Of Landscapes.\n\nLandscape painting includes every object that the country presents; and it is distinguished into the heroic, and the pastoral or rural; of which indeed all other styles are but mixtures.\n\nThe heroic style is a composition of objects, which in De Piles on their kinds draw both from art and nature every thing that is great and extraordinary in either. The situations are perfectly agreeable and surprising. The only buildings are temples, pyramids, ancient places of burial, altars consecrated to the divinities, pleasure houses of regular architecture; and if nature appear not there as we every day casually see her, she is at least represented as we think she ought to be. This style is an agreeable illusion, and a sort of enchantment, when handled by a man of fine genius and a good understanding, as Poussin was, who has so happily expressed it. But if, in the course of this style, the painter has not talent enough to maintain the sublime, he is often in danger of falling into the childish manner.\n\nThe rural style is a representation of countries, rather abandoned to the caprice of nature, than cultivated; we there see nature simple, without ornament, and without artifice; but with all those graces wherewith she adorns herself much more when left to herself than when constrained by art.\n\nIn this style, situations bear all sorts of varieties: sometimes they are very extensive and open, to contain the flocks of the shepherds; at others very wild, for the retreat of solitary persons, and a cover for wild beasts.\n\nIt rarely happens that a painter has a genius extensive enough to embrace all the parts of painting: there is commonly some one part that pre-engages our choice, and fills our mind, that we forget the pains that are due to the other parts; and we seldom fail to see, that those whose inclination leads them to the heroic style, think they have done all, when they have introduced into their compositions such noble objects as will rouse the imagination, without ever giving themselves the trouble to study the effects of good colouring. Those, on the other hand, who practise the pastoral, apply closely to colouring, in order to represent truth more lively. Both these styles have their followers and partisans. Those who follow the heroic, supply by their imagination what it wants of truth, and they look no further.\n\nAs a counterbalance to heroic landscape, it would be proper to put into the pastoral, besides a great character of truth, some affecting, extraordinary, but probable effect of nature, as was Titian's custom.\n\nThere is an infinity of pieces wherein both these styles happily meet; and which of the two has the ascendancy, will appear from what we have been just observing of their respective properties. The chief parts of landscapes are, their openings or situations, accidents, skies and clouds, offskips and mountains, verdure or turfing, rocks, grounds, or lands, terraces, fabrics, waters, fore-grounds, plants, figures, and trees; of all which in their places.\nOf Openings or Situations. The word *site*, or situation, signifies the \"view, prospect, or opening of a country.\" It is derived from the Italian word *sito*; and our painters have brought it into use, either because they were used to it in Italy, or because, as we think, they found it to be very expressive.\n\nSituations ought to be well put together; and so disengaged in their make, that the conjunction of grounds may not seem to be obstructed, though we should see but a part of them.\n\nSituations are various, and represented according to the country the painter is thinking of: as either open or close, mountainous or watery, tilled and inhabited, or wild and lonely; or, in fine, variegated by a prudent mixture of some of these. But if the painter be obliged to imitate nature in a flat and regular country, he must make it agreeable by a good disposition of the *claro-obscuro*, and such pleasing colouring as may make one foil unite with another.\n\nIt is certain, that extraordinary situations are very pleasing, and cheer the imagination by the novelty and beauty of their makes, even when the local colouring is but moderately performed: because, at worst, such pictures are only looked on as unfinished, and wanting to be completed by some skilful hand in colouring; whereas common situations and objects require good colouring and absolute finishing, in order to please. It was only by these properties that Claude Lorrain has made amends for his infirm choice in most of his situations. But in whatever manner that part be executed, one of the best ways to make it valuable, and even to multiply and vary it without altering its form, is properly to imagine some ingenious accident in it.\n\nOf Accidents.—An accident in painting is an obstruction of the sun's light by the interposition of clouds, in such manner, that some parts of the earth shall be in light and others in shade, which, according to the motion of the clouds, succeed each other, and produce such wonderful effects and changes of the *claro-obscuro*, as seem to create so many new situations. This is daily observed in nature. And as this newness of situations is grounded only on the shapes of the clouds, and their motions, which are very inconstant and unequal, it follows, that these accidents are arbitrary; and a painter of genius may dispose them to his own advantage when he thinks fit to use them: For he is not absolutely obliged to do it; and there have been some able landscape painters who have never practised it, either through fear or custom, as Claude Lorrain and some others.\n\nOf the Sky and Clouds.—The sky, in painters terms, is the ethereal part over our heads; but more particularly the air in which we breathe, and that where clouds and storms are engendered. Its colour is blue, growing clearer as it approaches the earth, because of the interposition of vapours arising between the eye and the horizon; which, being penetrated by the light, communicates it to objects in a greater or lesser degree, as they are more or less remote.\n\nBut we must observe, that this light being either yellow or reddish in the evening, at sunset, these same objects partake not only of the light, but of the colour: thus the yellow light mixing with the blue, which is the natural colour of the sky, alters it, and gives it a tint more or less greenish, as the yellowness of the light is more or less deep.\n\nThis observation is general and infallible: but there is an infinity of particular ones, which the painter must make upon the natural, with his pencil in his hand, when occasion offers; for there are very fine and singular effects appearing in the sky, which it is difficult to make one conceive by physical reasons. Who can tell, for example, why we see, in the bright part of some clouds, a fine red, when the source of the light which plays upon them is a most lively and distinguishing yellow? Who can account for the different reds seen in different clouds, at the very moment that these reds receive the light but in one place? For these colours and surprising appearances seem to have no relative to the rainbow, a phenomenon for which the philosopher pretends to give solid reasons.\n\nThese effects are all seen in the evening when the weather is inclining to change, either before a storm, or after it, when it is not quite gone, but has left some remains of it to draw our attention.\n\nThe property of clouds is to be thin and airy, both in shape and colour: their shapes, though infinite, must be studied and chosen after nature, at such times as they appear fine. To make them look thin, we ought to make their grounds unite thinly with them, especially near their extremities, as if they were transparent: And if we would have them thick, their reflections must be so managed, as, without destroying their thinness, they may seem to wind and unite, if necessary, with the clouds that are next to them. Little clouds often discover a little manner, and seldom have a good effect, unless when, being near each other, they seem altogether to make but one object.\n\nIn short, the character of the sky is to be luminous; and, as it is even the source of light, every thing that is upon the earth must yield to it in brightness: If, however, there is any thing that comes near it in light, it must be waters, and polished bodies which are susceptible of luminous reflections.\n\nBut whilst the painter makes the sky luminous, he must not represent it always shining throughout.\n\nOn the contrary, he must contrive his light so, that the greatest part of it may fall only upon one place: and, to make it more apparent, he must take as much care as possible to put it in opposition to some terrestrial object, that may render it more lively by its dark colour; as a tree, tower, or some other building that is a little high.\n\nThis principal light might also be heightened, by a certain disposition of clouds having a supposed light, or a light ingeniously inclosed between clouds, whose sweet obscurity spreads itself by little and little on all hands. We have a great many examples of this in the Flemish school, which best understood landscape; as Paul Bril, Brugel, Saveri: And the Sadeler and Merian's prints give a clear idea of it, and wonderfully awaken the genius of those who have the principles of the *claro-obscuro*.\n\nOf Offskips and Mountains.—Offskips have a near affinity with the sky; it is the sky which determines either the force or faintness of them. They are darkest when the sky is most loaded, and brightest when it is most clear. They sometimes intermix their shapes and lights;\nPart II.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nLandscapes; lights; and there are times, and countries, where the clouds pass between the mountains, whose tops rise and appear above them. Mountains that are high, and covered with snow, are very proper to produce extraordinary effects in the offskip, which are advantageous to the painter, and pleasing to the spectator.\n\nThe dilution of offskips is arbitrary; let them only agree with the whole together of the picture, and the nature of the country we would represent. They are usually blue, because of the interposition of air between them and the eye: but they lose this colour by degrees, as they come nearer the eye, and so take that which is natural to the objects.\n\nIn distancing mountains, we must observe to join them infiniby by the roundings off, which the reflections make probable; and must, among other things, avoid a certain edginess in their extremities, which makes them appear in slices, as if cut with scissors, and stuck upon the cloth.\n\nWe must further observe, that the air, at the feet of mountains, being charged with vapours, is more susceptible of light than at their tops. In this case we suppose the main light to be set reasonably high, and to enlighten the mountains equally, or that the clouds deprive them of the light of the sun. But if we suppose the main light to be very low, and to strike the mountains, then their tops will be strongly enlightened, as well as every thing else in the same degree of light.\n\nThough the forms of things diminish in bigness, and colours lose their strength, in proportion as they recede from the first plan of the picture, to the most remote offskip, as we observe in nature and common practice; yet this does not exclude the use of the accidents. These contribute greatly to the wonderful in landscape, when they are properly introduced, and when the artist has a just idea of their good effects.\n\nOf Verdure, or Turfing. By turfing is meant the greenness with which the herbs colour the ground: This is done several ways; and the diversity proceeds not only from the nature of plants, which, for the most part, have their particular verdures, but also from the change of seasons, and the colour of the earth, when the herbs are but thin form. By this variety, a painter may choose or unite, in the same tract of land, several sorts of greens, intermixed and blended together, which are often of great service to those who know how to use them; because this diversity of greens, as it is often found in nature, gives a character of truth to those parts, where it is properly used. There is a wonderful example of this part of landscape, in the view of Mechlin, by Rubens.\n\nOf Rocks. Though rocks have all sorts of shapes, and participate of all colours, yet there are in their diversity, certain characters which cannot be well expressed without having recourse to nature. Some are in banks, and set off with beds of shrubs; others in huge blocks, either projecting or falling back; others consist of large broken parts, contiguous to each other; and others, in short, of an enormous size, all in one stone, either naturally, as free-stone, or else through the injuries of time, which in the course of many ages has worn away their marks of separation. But, whatever their form be, they are usually set out with clefts, breaks, hollows, bushes, mosses, and the plains of time; and these particulars, well managed, create a certain idea of truth.\n\nRocks are of themselves gloomy, and only proper for\n\nVol. XV. Part II.\nLandscapes doubles all the objects that are opposite to it; and in this state they have more life than in the most violent agitation. Consult Bourdon's works, or at least his prints, on this subject: he is one of those who have treated of waters with the greatest spirit and best genius.\n\nWaters are not proper for every situation: but to express them well, the artist ought to be perfect master of the exactness of watery reflections; because they only make painted water appear as real: for practice alone, without exactness, destroys the effect, and abates the pleasure of the eye. The rule for these reflections is very easy, and therefore the painter is less pardonable for neglecting it.\n\nBut it must be observed, that though water be as a looking-glass, yet it does not faithfully represent objects but when it is still; for if it be in any motion, either in a natural course, or by the driving of the wind, its surface becoming uneven, receives on its surges such lights and shades as, mixing with the appearance of the objects, confound both their shapes and colours.\n\nOf the Foreground of a Picture. As it is the part of the foreground to usher the eye into the piece, great care must be taken that the eye meet with good reception; sometimes by the opening of a fine terrace, whose design and workmanship may be equally curious; sometimes by a variety of well distinguished plants, and those sometimes flowered; and at other times, by figures in a lively taste, or other objects, either admirable for their novelty or introduced as by chance.\n\nIn a word, the artist cannot too much study his foreground objects, since they attract the eye, impress the first character of truth, and greatly contribute to make the artifice of a picture successful, and to anticipate our esteem for the whole work.\n\nOf Plants. Plants are not always necessary in foregrounds, because, as we have observed, there are several ways of making those grounds agreeable. But if we resolve to draw plants there, we ought to paint them exactly after the life; or at least, among such as we paint practically, there ought to be some more finished than the rest, and whose kinds may be distinguished by the difference of design and colouring, to the end that, by a probable supposition, they may give the others a character of truth. What has been said here of plants may be applied to the branches and barks of trees.\n\nOf Figures. In composing landscape, the artist may have intended to give it a character agreeable to the subject he has chosen, and which his figures ought to represent. He may also, and it commonly happens, have only thought of his figures, after finishing his landscape. The truth is, the figures in most landscapes are made rather to accompany than to suit them.\n\nIt is true, there are landscapes so disposed and situated, as to require only passing figures; which several good masters, each in his style, have introduced, as Poussin in the heroic, and Fouquier in the rural, with all probability and grace. It is true also, that resting figures have been made to appear inwardly active. And these two different ways of treating figures are not to be blamed, because they act equally, though in a different manner. It is rather inaction that ought to be blamed in figures; for in this condition, which robs them of all connection with the landscape, they appear to be pasted on. But without landscapes obstructing the painter's liberty in this respect, undoubtedly the best way to make figures valuable is, to make them so to agree with the character of the landscape, that it may seem to have been made purely for the figures. We would not have them either insipid or indifferent, but to repelent some little subject to awaken the spectator's attention, or else to give the picture a name of distinction among the curious.\n\nGreat care must be taken to proportion the size of the figures to the bigness of the trees, and other objects of the landscape. If they be too large, the picture will discover a little manner; and if too small, they will have the air of pignies; which will destroy the worth of them, and make the landscape look enormous. There is, however, a greater inconvenience in making figures too large than too small; because the latter at least gives an air of greatness to all the rest. But as landscape figures are generally small, they must be touched with spirit, and such lively figures as will attract, and yet preserve probability and a general union. The artist must, in fine, remember, that as the figures chiefly give life to a landscape, they must be dispersed as conveniently as possible.\n\nOf Trees. The beauty of trees is perhaps one of the greatest ornaments of landscape; on account of the variety of their kinds, and their freshness, but chiefly their lightness, which makes them seem, as being exposed to the air, to be always in motion.\n\nThough diversity be pleasing in all the objects of landscape, it is chiefly in trees that it shows its greatest beauty. Landscape considers both their kinds and their forms. Their kinds require the painter's particular study and attention, in order to distinguish them from each other; for we must be able at first sight to discover which are oaks, elms, firs, fynannes, poplars, willows, pines, and other such trees, which, by a specific colour, or touching, are distinguishable from all other kinds. This study is too large to be acquired in all its extent; and, indeed, few painters have attained such a competent exactness in it as their art requires. But it is evident, that those who come nearest to perfection in it, will make their works infinitely pleasing, and gain a great name.\n\nBesides the variety which is found in each kind of tree, there is in all trees a general variety. This is observed in the different manners in which their branches are disposed by a sport of nature; which takes delight in making some very vigorous and thick, others more dry and thin; some more green, others more red or yellow. The excellence of practice lies in the mixture of these varieties: but if the artist can distinguish the forts but indifferently, he ought at least to vary their makes and colours; because repetition in landscape is as tiresome to the eye, as monotony in discourse is to the ear.\n\nThe variety of their makes is so great, that the painter would be inexcusable not to put it in practice upon occasion, especially when he finds it necessary to awaken the spectator's attention; for, among trees, we discover the young and the old, the open and close, tapering and squat, bending upwards and downwards, sloping and floating: in short, the variety is rather to be conceived than expressed. For instance, the character of young trees is, to have long flender branches, few in number, but\nAmong the many great masters of all schools, De Landscape Piles prefers Titian's wooden prints, where the trees are well shaped; and those which Cornelius Cort and Agostino Caracci have engraved. And he affirms, that beginners can do no better than contrast, above all things, an habit of imitating the touches of these great masters, and of conferring at the same time the perspective of the branches and foliages, and observing how they appear, either when rising and seen from below, or when sinking and seen from above, or when fronting and viewed from a point, or when they appear in profile; and, in a word, when set in the various views in which nature presents them, without altering their characters.\n\nAfter having studied and copied with the pen or crayon, first the prints, and then the designs of Titian and Caracci, the student should imitate with the pencil those touches which they have most distinctly specified, if their paintings can be procured; but since they are scarce, others should be got which have a good character for their touching; as those of Fouquet, who is a most excellent model: Paul Bril, Breugel, and Bourdon, are also very good; their touching is neat, lively, and thin.\n\nAfter having duly weighed the nature of trees, their spread and order, and the disposition of their branches, the artist must get a lively idea of them, in order to keep up the spirit of them throughout, either by making them apparent and distinct in the fore-grounds, or obscure and confused in proportion to their distance.\n\nAfter having thus gained some knowledge in good manner, it will next be proper to study after nature, and to choose and rectify it according to the idea which the aforesaid great masters had of it. As to perfection, it can only be expected from long practice and perseverance. On the whole, it is proper for those who have an inclination for landscape, above all things to take the proper methods for beginning it well.\n\nAs for those who have made some advances in this part of painting, it is proper they should collect the necessary materials for their further improvement, and study those objects at least which they shall have most frequent occasion to represent.\n\nPainters usually comprise, under the word study, anything whatever which they either design or paint separately after the life; whether figures, heads, feet, hands, draperies, animals, mountains, trees, plants, flowers, fruits, or whatever may confirm them in the just imitation of nature: the drawing of these things is what they call study; whether they be for instruction in design, or only to allure them of the truth, and to perfect their work. In fact, this word study is the more properly used by painters, as in the diversity of nature they are daily making new discoveries, and confirming themselves in what they already know.\n\nAs the landscape-painter need only study such objects as are to be met with in the country, we would recommend to him some order, that his drawings may be always at hand when he wants them. For instance, he should copy after nature, on separate papers, the different effects of trees in general, and the different effects of each kind in particular, with their trunks, foliage, and colours. He should also take the same method with some sorts of plants, because their variety is a great ornament to terraces on fore-grounds. He ought likewise to study the effects of the sky in the several times of the day.\nLandscapes and scenes of the year, in the various dispositions of clouds, both in serene, thundering, and stormy weather; and in the off-shore, the several sorts of rocks, waters, and other principal objects.\n\nThese drawings, which may be made at different times, should be collected together; and all that relate to one matter be put into a book, to which the artist may have recourse at any time for what he wants.\n\nNow, if the fine effects of nature, whether in shape or colour, whether for an entire picture or a part of one, be the artist's study; and if the difficulty lies in choosing those effects well, he must for this purpose be born with good sense, good taste, and a fine genius; and this genius must be cultivated by the observations which ought to be made on the works of the best masters, how they choose nature, and how, while they corrected her, according to their art, they preserved her character. With these advantages, derived from nature and perfected by art, the painter cannot fail to make a good choice; and, by distinguishing between the good and the bad, must needs find great instruction even from the most common things.\n\nTo improve themselves in this kind of studies, painters have taken several methods.\n\nThere are some artists who have designed after nature, and in the open fields; and have there quite finished those parts which they had chosen, but without adding any colour to them.\n\nOthers have drawn, in oil colours, in a middle tint, on strong paper; and found this method convenient, because, the colours linking, they could put colour on colour, though different from each other. For this purpose they took with them a flat box, which commodiously held their pallet, pencils, oil, and colours. This method, which indeed requires several implements, is doubtless the best for drawing nature more particularly, and with greater exactness, especially if, after the work be dry and varnished, the artist return to the place where he drew, and retouch the principal things after nature.\n\nOthers have only drawn the outlines of objects, and slightly washed them in colours near the life, for the sake of their memory. Others have attentively observed such parts as they had a mind to retain, and contented themselves with committing them to their memory, which upon occasion gave them a faithful account of them. Others have made drawings in pastil and wash together. Others, with more curiosity and patience, have gone several times to the places which were to their taste: the first time they only made choice of the parts, and drew them correctly; and the other times were spent in observing the variety of colouring, and its alterations through change of light.\n\nNow these several methods are very good, and each may be practised as best suits the student and his temper: but they require the necessaries of painting, as colours, pencils, pastils, and leisure. Nature, however, at certain times, presents extraordinary but transient beauties; and such as can be of no service to the artist who has not as much time as is necessary to imitate what he admires. The best way, perhaps, to make advantage of such momentary occasions, is this:\n\nThe painter being provided with a quire of paper, and a black-lead pencil, let him quickly, but slightly, design what he sees extraordinary; and to remember landscapes, the colouring, let him mark the principal parts with characters, which he may explain at the bottom of the paper, as far as is necessary for himself to understand them: A cloud, for instance, may be marked A, another cloud B, a light C, a mountain D, a terrace E, and so on. And having repeated these letters at the bottom of the paper, let him write against each that it is of such or such a colour; or, for greater brevity, only blue, red, violet, gray, &c., or any other shorter abbreviation. After this, he must go to painting as soon as possible; otherwise most of what he has observed will, in a little time, slip out of his memory. This method is the more useful, as it not only prevents our losing an infinity of sudden and transitory beauties, but also helps, by means of the aforesaid marks and characters, to perfect the other methods we have mentioned.\n\nIf it be asked, Which is the properest time for these studies? the answer is, That nature should be studied at all times, because she is to be represented at all seasons; but autumn yields the most plentiful harvest for her fine effects: the mildness of that season, the beauty of the sky, the richness of the earth, and the variety of objects, are powerful inducements with the painter to make the proper inquiries for improving his genius and perfecting his art.\n\nBut as we cannot see or observe every thing, it is very commendable to make use of other men's studies, and to look upon them as if they were our own. Raphael sent some young men into Greece to design such things as he thought would be of service to him, and accordingly made use of them to as good purpose as if he himself had designed them on the spot: for this, Raphael is so far from deserving censure, that he ought, on the contrary, to be commended; as an example, that painters ought to leave no way untried for improving in their professions. The landscape painter may, accordingly, make use of the works of all those who have excelled in any kind, in order to acquire a good manner; like the bees which gather their variety of honey from different flowers.\n\nGeneral Remarks on Landscapes. As the general rules of painting are the basis of all the several kinds of it, we must refer the landscape painter to them, or rather suppose him to be well acquainted with them. We shall here only make some general remarks on this kind of painting.\n\nI. Landscape supposes the knowledge and practice of the principal rules in perspective, in order to maintain probability.\n\nII. The higher the leaves of trees are to the earth, the larger they are, and the greener; as being aptest to receive, in abundance, the sap which nourishes them: and the upper branches begin first to take the redness or yellowness which colours them in autumn. But it is otherwise in plants; for their stocks renew all the year round, and their leaves succeed one another at a considerable distance of time, inasmuch that nature, employed in producing new leaves to adorn the stock as it rises, does by degrees desert the under ones; which, having first performed their office, are the first that die: but this effect is more visible in some than in others.\n\nIII. The under parts of all leaves are of a brighter green than the upper, and almost always incline to the silverish;\nPart II.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nLandscapes silverith; and those which are wind-shaken are known from others by that colour: but if we view them from beneath, when penetrated by the sun's rays, they discover such a fine and lively green as is far beyond all comparison.\n\nIV. There are five principal things which give spirit to landscape, viz. figures, animals, waters, wind-shaken trees, and thinness of pencilling; to which add smoke, where there is occasion to introduce it.\n\nV. When one colour predominates throughout a landscape, as one green in spring, or one red in autumn, the piece will look either as of one colour, or else as unfinished. We have seen many of Bourdon's landscapes, which, by handling the corn one way throughout, have lost much of their beauty, though the situations and waters were very pleasant. The ingenious painter must endeavour to correct, and, as they say, redeem the harsh unlighted colouring of winter and spring by means of figures, waters, and buildings; for summer and autumn subjects are of themselves capable of great variety.\n\nVI. Titian and Carrache are the best models for inspiring good taste, and leading the painter into a good track, with regard to forms and colours. He must use all his efforts, to gain a just idea of the principles which those great men have left us in their works; and to have his imagination filled with them, if he would advance by degrees towards that perfection which the artist should have always in view.\n\nVII. The landscapes of these two masters teach us a great many things, of which discourse can give us no exact idea, nor any general principle. Which way, for example, can the measures of trees in general be determined, as we determine those of the human body? The tree has no settled proportions; most of its beauty lies in the contrast of its branches, an unequal distribution of boughs, and, in short, a kind of whimsical variety, which nature delights in, and of which the painter becomes a judge when he has thoroughly relished the works of the two masters aforeaid. But we must say, in Titian's praise, that the path he struck out is the surest; because he has exactly imitated nature in its variety with an exquisite taste, and fine colouring; whereas Carrache, though an able artist, has not, more than others, been free from manner in his landscapes.\n\nVIII. One of the greatest perfections of landscape, in the variety it represents, is a faithful imitation of each particular character: as its greatest fault is a licentious practice, which brings us to do things by rote.\n\nIX. Among those things which are painted practically, we ought to intermix some done after nature, to induce the spectator to believe that all are so.\n\nX. As there are styles of thought, so there are also styles of execution. We have handled the two relating to thought, viz. the heroic and pastoral; and find that there are two also with regard to execution, viz. the firm style, and the polished; these two concern the pencil, and the more or less ingenious way of conducting it. The firm style gives life to work, and excuse for bad choice; and the polished finishes and brightens every thing; it leaves no employment for the spectator's imagination, which pleases itself in discovering and finishing things which it attributes to the artist, though in fact they proceed only from itself. The polished Portraiture-style degenerates into the soft and dull, if not supported by a good opening or situation; but when those two characters meet, the picture is fine.\n\nSect. III. Of Portraiture.\n\nIf painting be an imitation of nature, it is doubly so in a portrait; which not only represents a man in general, but such a one as may be distinguished from all others. And as the greatest perfection of a portrait is extreme likeness, so the greatest of its faults is to resemble a person for whom it was not made; since there are not in the world two persons quite like one another. But before we proceed to the particulars which let us into the knowledge of this imitation, it is necessary, for shortening this part of our subject, to attend to some general propositions.\n\nI. Imitation is the essence of painting; and good choice is to this essence what the virtues are to a man; they raise the value of it. For this reason, it is extremely the painter's interest to choose none but good heads, or favourable moments for drawing them, and such positions as may supply the want of a fine natural.\n\nII. There are views of the natural more or less advantageous; all depends upon turning it well, and taking it in the favourable moment.\n\nIII. There is not a single person in the world who has not a peculiar character both in body and face.\n\nIV. Simple and genuine nature is more proper for imitation; and is a better choice than nature much formed, and embellished too artificially.\n\nV. To adorn nature too much is doing it a violence; and the action which attends it can never be free when its ornaments are not easy. In short, in proportion as we adorn nature, we make it degenerate from itself, and bring it down to art.\n\nVI. Some means are more advantageous than others to come at the same end.\n\nVII. We must not only imitate what we do see in nature, but also what we may possibly see that is advantageous in art.\n\nVIII. Things are valuable by comparison; and it is only by this we are enabled to make a right judgement of them.\n\nIX. Painters easily accustom themselves to their own tints, and the manner of their masters: and after this habit is rooted in them, they view nature not as she really is, but as they are used to paint her.\n\nX. It is very difficult to make a picture, the figures of which are as big as the life, to have its effect near as at a distance. A learned picture pleases the ignorant only when it is at some distance; but judges will admire its artifice near, and its effect at a distance.\n\nXI. Knowledge makes work pleasant and easy. The traveller who knows his road, comes to his journey's end with more speed and certainty than he who inquires and gropes it out.\n\nXII. It is proper, before we begin a work, to meditate upon it, and to make a nice coloured sketch of it, for our own satisfaction, and a help to the memory.\n\nWe cannot too much reflect on these propositions; and it\nPortraiture it is necessary to be well acquainted with them, that they may present themselves to our mind, of their own accord, without our being at the trouble to recall them to our memory when we are at work.\n\nThere are four things necessary to make a portrait perfect; air, colouring, attitude, and dress.\n\nOf Air. The air reflects the lines of the face, the head attire, and the fize.\n\nThe lines of the face depend upon exactness of draught, and agreement of the parts; which all together must represent the physiognomy of the person painted in such a manner, that the picture of his body may seem to be almost that of his mind.\n\nIt is not exactness of design in portraits that gives spirit and true air, so much as the agreement of the parts at the very moment when the disposition and temperament of the sitter are to be hit off. We see several portraits which, though correctly designed, have a cold, languishing, and stupid air; whilst others, less correct in design, strike us, however, at first sight with the sitter's character.\n\nFew painters have been careful enough to put the parts well together: Sometimes the mouth is smiling, and the eyes are sad; at other times, the eyes are cheerful, and the cheeks lank: by which means their work has a false air, and looks unnatural. We ought therefore to remember, that, when the sitter puts on a smiling air, the eyes close, the corners of the mouth draw up towards the nostrils, the cheeks swell, and the eyebrows widen: but in a melancholy air, these parts have a contrary effect.\n\nThe eyebrows, being raised, give a grave and noble air; but if arched, an air of astonishment.\n\nOf all the parts of the face, that which contributes most to likeness is the nose; it is therefore of great moment to set and draw it well.\n\nThough the hair of the head seems to be part of the dress, which is capable of various forms without altering the air of the face; yet the head attire which one has been most accustomed to creates such a likeness, that we scarce know a familiar acquaintance on his putting on a periwig somewhat different from that which he used to wear. It is necessary therefore, as far as possible, to take the air of the head ornament, and make it accompany and set off that of the face, if there be no reason to the contrary.\n\nAs to the stature, it contributes so much to likeness, that we very often know people without seeing their face: It is therefore extremely proper to draw the size after the sitter himself, and in such an attitude as we think fit; which was Van Dyke's method. Here let us remark, that, in fitting, the person appears to be of a less free make, through the heaving of his shoulders; wherefore, to adjust his size, it is proper to make him stand for a small time, swaying in the posture we would give him, and then make our observation. But here occurs a difficulty, which we shall endeavour to examine: \"Whether it is proper, in portraiture, to correct the defects of nature?\"\n\nLikeness being the essence of portraiture, it would seem that we ought to imitate defects as well as beauties, since by this means the imitation will be more complete: It would be even hard to prove the contrary to one who would undertake the defence of this position. But ladies and gentlemen do not much approve of those painters who entertain such sentiments, and put colouring them in practice. It is certain that some complaisance in this respect is due to them; and there is little doubt but their pictures may be made to resemble, without displeasing them; for the effectual likeness is a just agreement of the parts that are painted with those of nature; so that we may be at no loss to know the air of the face, and the temper of the person, whose picture is before us. All deformities, therefore, when the air and temper may be discovered without them, ought to be either corrected or omitted in women's and young men's portraits. A nose somewhat awry may be helped, or a shrivelled neck or high shoulders adapted to a good air, without going from one extreme to another. But this must be done with great discretion: for, by endeavouring to correct nature too much, we infallibly fall into a method of giving a general air to all our portraits; just as, by confining ourselves too much to the defects and littleness of nature, we are in danger of falling into the low and tattletale manner.\n\nBut in the faces of heroes and men of rank, distinguished either by dignities, virtues, or great qualities, we cannot be too exact, whether the parts be beautiful or not: for portraits of such persons are to be standing monuments to posterity; in which case, every thing in a picture is precious that is faithful. But after whatever manner the painter acquits himself in this point, let him never forget good air nor grace; and that there are, in the natural, advantageous moments for hitting them off.\n\nOf Colouring.—Colouring, in portraiture, is an effusion of nature, discovering the true temper of persons; and the temper being essential to likeness, it ought to be handled as exactly as the design. This part is the more valuable, as it is rare and difficult to hit. A great many painters have come to a likeness by strokes and outlines; but certainly they are few who have shown in colours the tempers of persons.\n\nTwo points are necessary in colouring; exactness of tints, and the art of setting them off. The former is acquired by practice, in examining and comparing the colours we see in life with those by which we would imitate it: and the art of those tints consists in knowing what one colour will produce when set by another, and in making good what either distance or time may abate of the glow and freshness of the colours.\n\nA painter who does nothing more than what he sees, will never arrive at a perfect imitation; for though his work may seem, on the ear, to be good to him, it may not appear so to others, and perhaps even to himself, at a distance. A tint which, near, appears disjointed, and of one colour, may look of another at a distance, and be confounded in the mass it belongs to. If you would have your work, therefore, to produce a good effect in the place where it is to hang, both the colours and lights must be a little loaded; but learnedly, and with discretion. In this point consult Titian, Rubens, Van Dyke, and Rembrandt's method; for indeed their art is wonderful.\n\nThe tints usually require three times of observation. The first is at the person's first sitting down, when he has more spirit and colour than ordinary; and this is to be noted in the first hour of his sitting. The second is when, being composed, his look is as usual; which is to be observed in the second hour. And the third is\nAttitude, when, through tiresomeness by sitting in one posture, his colour alters to what weariness usually creates. On which account, it is best to keep to the sitter's usual tint, a little improved. He may also rise, and take some turns about the room, to gain fresh spirits, and shake off or prevent tiresomeness.\n\nIn draperies, all sorts of colours do not suit all sorts of persons. In men's portraits, we need only observe great truth and great force; but in women's there must also be charms; whatever beauty they have must appear in a fine light, and their blemishes must by some means or other be softened. For this reason, a white, lively, and bright tint, ought never to be set off by a fine yellow, which would make it look like plaster; but rather by colours inclining to green, blue, or gray, or such others as, by the opposition, may make the tint appear more flecky than usual in fair women. Vandyke often made a fillet or coloured curtain for his ground; but that colour is soft and brown. Brown women, on the other hand, who have yellow enough in their tints to support the character of fleshiness, may very well have yellowish draperies, in order to bring down the yellow of their tints, and make them look the fresher; and near very high coloured and lively carnations linen does wonders.\n\nIn grounds, two things are observable; the tone and the colour. The colour is to be considered in the same manner as those of draperies, with respect to the head. The tone must be always different from the mass it supports, and of which it is the ground, that the objects coming upon it may not seem transparent, but solid and raised. The colour of the hair of the head usually determines the tone of the ground; and when the former is a bright chestnut, we are often embarrassed, unless helped by means of a curtain, or some accident of the chiaro obscurè, supposed to be behind, or unless the ground is a sky.\n\nWe must further observe, that where a ground is neither curtain nor landscape, or such like, but is plain and like a wall, it ought to be very much partly-coloured, with almost imperceptible patches or stains; for, besides its being so in nature, the picture will look the more grand.\n\nOf Attitude, or Pose.—Attitudes ought to suit the age and qualities of persons and their tempers. In old men and women, they should be grave, majestic, and sometimes bold; and generally, in women, they ought to have a noble simplicity and modest cheerfulness; for modesty ought to be the character of women; a charm infinitely beyond coquetry! and indeed coquettes themselves are not to be painted such.\n\nAttitudes are of two kinds: one in motion, the other at rest. Those at rest may suit every person; but those in motion are proper for young people only, and are hard to be expressed; because a great part of the hair and drapery must be moved by the air; motion, in painting, being never better expressed than by such agitations. The attitudes at rest must not appear so much at rest as to seem to represent an inactive person, and one who sits for no other purpose but to be a copy. And though the figure that is represented be at rest, yet the painter, if he thinks fit, may give it a flying drapery, provided the scene or ground be not a chamber or close place.\n\nIt is above all things necessary that the figures which are not employed should appear to satisfy the spectator's curiosity; and for this purpose show themselves in such an action as suits their tempers and conditions, as if they would inform him what they really were: and as most people pretend to sincerity, honesty, and greatness of mind, we must avoid in attitudes, all manner of affectation; everything there must appear easy and natural, and discover more or less spirit, nobleness, and majesty, in proportion to the person's character and dignity. In a word, the attitudes are the language of portraits; and the skilful painter ought to give great attention to them.\n\nBut the best attitudes are such as induce the spectator to think that the sitter took a favourable opportunity of being seen to advantage, and without affectation. There is only one thing to be observed with regard to women's portraits, in whatever attitude they are placed; which is, that they sway in such a manner as to give their face but little shade; and that we carefully examine whether the lady appear most beautiful in a smiling or in a serious air, and conduct ourselves accordingly. Let us now proceed to the next article.\n\nOf Practice in Portraiture.—According to De Piles, portraiture requires three different fittings and operations; viz., dead colouring, second colouring, and retouching or finishing. Before the painter dead colour, he must attentively consider what aspect will best suit the sitter, by putting him in different positions, if we have not any settled design before us; and when we have determined this, it is of the last consequence to put the parts well together, by comparing always one part with another; for not only the portrait acquires a greater likeness when well designed, but it is troublesome to make alterations at the second fitting, when the artist must only think of painting, that is, of disposing and uniting his colours.\n\nExperience tells us, that the dead colouring ought to be clean, because of the slop and transparency of the colours, especially in the shades: and when the parts are well put together, and become clammy, they must be judiciously sweetened and melted into each other; yet without taking away the air of the picture, that the painter may have the pleasure of finishing it, in proportion as he draws. But if fiery geniuses do not like this method of scumbling, let them only mark the parts slightly, and so far as is necessary for giving an air.\n\nIn dead colouring, it is proper to put in rather too little than too much hair about the forehead; that, in finishing, we may be at liberty to place it where we please, and to paint it with all possible softness and delicacy. If, on the contrary, you sketch upon the forehead a lock which may appear to be of a good taste, and becoming the work, you may be puzzled in finishing it, and not find the life exactly in the same position as you would paint it. But this observation is not meant for men of skill and consummate experience, who have nature in their heads, and make her submit to their ideas.\n\nThe business of the second fitting is, to put the colours well in their places, and to paint them in a manner that is suitable to the sitter and to the effect we propose: But before they are made clammy, we ought to examine afresh whether the parts are rightly placed,\nPractice of and here and there to give some touches towards likeness, that, when we are assured of it, the work may go on with greater satisfaction. If the painter understands what he is about, and the portrait be judiciously designed, he ought as much as possible to work quick; the fitter will be better pleased, and the work will by this means have the most spirit and life. But this readiness is only the effect of long study and experience; for we may well be allowed a considerable time to find out a road that is easy, and such as we must often travel in.\n\nBefore we retouch or finish, it is proper to terminate the hair, that, on finishing the carnations, we may be able to judge of the effect of the whole head.\n\nIf, at the second sitting, we cannot do all we intended, which often happens, the third makes up the loss, and gives both spirit, physiognomy, and character.\n\nIf we would paint a portrait at once, we must load the colouring; but neither sweeten, nor drive, nor very much oil it: and if we dip the pencil in varnish as the work advances, this will readily enable us to put colour on colour, and to mix them without driving.\n\nThe use and sight of good pictures give greater light into things than words can express: What hits one artist's understanding and temper may be disagreeable to another's; and almost all painters have taken different ways, though their principles were often the same.\n\nWe are told that a friend of Vandyke's having observed to him how little time he bestowed on his portraits, Vandyke answered, \"That at first he worked hard, and took great pains, to acquire a reputation, and also to get a swift hand, against the time he should work for his kitchen.\" Vandyke's custom is said to have been this: He appointed both the day and hour for the person's sitting, and worked not above an hour on any portrait, either in rubbing in or finishing; so that as soon as his clock informed him that the hour was out, he rose up, and made a bow to the fitter, to signify, that he had done enough for that day, and then appointed another hour some other day; whereupon his servant came to clean his pencils, and brought a fresh pallet, whilst he was receiving another fitter, whose day and hour he had before appointed. By this method he worked on several pictures the same day, with extraordinary expedition.\n\nAfter having lightly dead-coloured the face, he put the fitter into some attitude which he had before contrived; and on a gray paper, with white and black crayons, he designed, in a quarter of an hour, his shape and drapery, which he disposed in a grand manner, and an exquisite taste. After this, he gave the drawing to the skilful people he had about him, to paint after the fitter's own clothes, which, at Vandyke's request, were sent to him for that purpose. When his disciples had done what they could to these draperies, he lightly went over them again; and so, in a little time, by his great knowledge, displayed the art and truth which we at this day admire in them. As for hands, he had in his house people of both sexes, whom he paid, and who served as models.\n\nThis conduct of Vandyke, however, is mentioned rather to gratify the reader's curiosity, than to excite his imitation; he may choose as much of it as he pleases, and as suits his own genius, and leave the rest.\n\nWe must observe by the way, that there is nothing so rare as fine hands, either in the design or colouring. It is therefore convenient to cultivate, if we can, a friendship with some woman who will take pleasure in serving for a copy: The way to win them is, to praise their beauty exceedingly. But if an opportunity serves of copying hands after Vandyke, it must not be let slip; for he drew them with a surprising delicacy, and an admirable colouring.\n\nIt is of great service to copy after the manners which come nearest to nature; as are those of Titian and Vandyke. We must, at such times, believe them to be nature itself; and, at some distance, consider them as such, and say to ourselves—What colour and tint shall I use for such a part? And then, coming near the picture, we ought to examine whether we are right or not; and to make a fixed rule of what we have discovered, and did not practice before without uncertainty.\n\nIt is recommended, before we begin colouring, to catch the very first moments, which are commonly the most agreeable and most advantageous, and to keep them in our memory for use when we are finishing: for the fitter, growing tired with being long in the same place, loses those spirits, which, at his first sitting down, gave beauty to the parts, and conveyed to the tint more lively blood, and a fresher colour. In short, we must join to truth a probable and advantageous possibility, which, far from abating likeness, serves rather to set it off. For this end, we ought to begin with observing the ground of a tint, as well what it is in lights as in shades; for the shades are only beautiful as they are proportioned to the light. We must observe, if the tint be very lively, whether it partake of yellowness, and where that yellowness is placed; because usually, towards the end of the fitting, fatigue diffuses a general yellowness, which makes us forget what parts were of this colour, and what were not, unless we had taken due notice of it before. For this reason, at the second fitting, the colours must be everywhere readily clasped in, and such as appear at the first sitting down; for these are always the finest.\n\nThe surest way to judge of colours is by comparison; and to know a tint, nothing is better than to compare it with linen placed next it, or else placed next to the natural object, if there be occasion.—We say this only to those who have little practised nature.\n\nThe portrait being now supposed to be as much finished as you are able, nothing remains, but, at some reasonable distance, to view both the picture and fitter together, in order to determine with certainty, whether there is anything still wanting to perfect the work.\n\nSect. IV. Of Theatrical Decorations; the Designs for Furniture, Embroidery, Carriages, &c.\n\nOf Theatrical Decorations.—This is a particular art, which unites several of the general parts of painting with the knowledge of architecture, perspective, &c. They\nTheatrical They who apply themselves to it would do well to\ndesign their decorations by day, and to colour them\nby candle light, as they will be much better able to\njudge of the effect of a painting intended to be viewed\nby that light. It is proper also to caution the young\npainter to avoid, as much as possible, the uniting the\nimitations of nature with nature itself; that is, he should\nnot introduce with his decorations living horses, or\nother animals, real fountains or cascades, trees, or sta-\ntues, &c. For such combinations are the effect of\nignorance and a bad taste; they are the resource of\npainters of little ability; they discover a sterility of\ninvention, and produce great inconvenience in the re-\npresentation. Those pieces which they call moving\npictures, where the painted landscape remains immove-\nable, and the figures move by means of springs, form a\npart of these decorations; and there are some of them,\nas those of Antwerp and Ghent, that have a pleasing\neffect.\n\nThe designs for furniture, carriages, porcelain, and\nother branches of manufacture, form also a very im-\nportant article of painting in general, and of academ-\ny painting in particular. This is a distinct branch\nof the art; and without doubt not the least useful of\nits parts, as it concerns so essentially to the success of\nmanufactures, and consequently to the prosperity of a\nstate; and it is an art, to which it were much to be\nwished that youth of ability and invention would ap-\nply themselves. See the articles JAPANNING and Por-\nCELLAIN.\n\nSect. V. Enumeration of the different Methods of Paint-\ning, or the different Means and Materials that Painters\nmake use of to imitate all visible Objects on a plane Su-\nperficies.\n\nThose now in practice are,\n\n1. Painting in oil; which is preferable to all other\nmethods, as it is more susceptible of all sorts of ex-\npressions, of more perfect gradations of colours, and is at the\nsame time more durable.*\n\n2. Mosaic painting; an invention truly wonderful.\nIt is composed of a great number of small pieces of\nmarble of different colours, joined together with stucco.\nThe works of this kind are made principally at Rome,\nwhere this art has been carried so far as to resemble the\npaintings of the greatest masters; and of these are made\nmonuments for the latest posterity.\n\n3. Painting in fresco, which is by drawing, with\ncolours diluted with water, on a wall newly plastered,\nand with which they incorporate, that they perish\nonly with the stucco itself. This is principally used on\nceilings.\n\n4. Painting in water colours; that is, with col-\nours mixed with water and gum, or paste, &c.\n\n5. Miniature painting; which differs from the\npreceding as it represents objects in the least discerni-\nble magnitudes.\n\n6. Painting in crayons; for which purpose colours,\neither simple or compound, are mixed with gum, and\nmade into a kind of hard paste like chalk, and with\nwhich they draw on paper or parchment.\n\n7. Painting in enamel; which is done on copper or\ngold, with mineral colours that are dried by fire, and\nbecome very durable. The paintings on the porcelain\nof China and Europe, on Delft ware, &c. are so many\nforts of enamel.\n\n8. Painting in wax, or encaustic painting: This is\na new, or rather an old invention renewed, in which\nthere are in France performances highly pleasing. It\nis done with wax mixed with varnish and colours.\n\n9. Painting on glass; of which there are various\nkinds.\n\nSee all the articles here enumerated, explained in the\norder of the alphabet. On one of them, however, some\nadditional observations may here be subjoined.\n\n§ I. Of Painting in Fresco.\n\nOf all kinds of painting, fresco is the most ancient,\nthe most durable, the most speedily executed, and the\nmost proper to adorn great buildings. It appears, that\nthe fragments of ancient painting handed down to us\nby the Romans are all in fresco. Nordens, quoted by\nWinkelman, speaks of the ruins of Egyptian palaces\nand temples, in which are colossal paintings on walls\n80 feet high. The description which those authors\nhave given of these paintings, of the prepared ground,\nand of the manner in which the colours have been em-\nployed, &c. shows plainly that they have been executed\nin fresco.\n\nThe stability of fresco is demonstrated by the exist-\nence of those fragments of the highest antiquity. There\nare no other kinds of painting which could equally have\nresisted the injuries of the weather, the excessive aridity\nof certain climates, the moisture of subterranean situa-\ntions, and the encroachments of barbarians.\n\nThere are different opinions concerning the climate\nmost proper to preserve this kind of painting. \"It is\nobserved (says Felibien), that the colours in fresco fade\nsooner in Italy and Languedoc than at Paris; perhaps\nfrom less heat in the last mentioned place, or better\nlime.\" M. Falconet contradicts this assertion in his\nnotes on Pliny, vol. i. p. 223, of his miscellaneous\nworks, published at Paris 1787. Painting in fresco,\naccording to this author, is longer preserved in dry\nand warm, than in northern and moist climates. How-\never opposite the sentiments of these two authors may\nappear to be, it is possible to reconcile them, when\nwe consider, that the exposure to a burning sun is ca-\npable of operating a great change of the colours on\nthe one hand, and that the frost in a cold climate inev-\nitably destroys the paintings of fresco on the other.\nFrost is capable of bursting stones, of corroding the\npetrified veins of earth in the heart of coloured marble,\nand, in short, nothing can resist its destructive opera-\ntion.\n\nThese observations on fresco paintings lead us to\nconclude, that the choice of place, when they are with-\nout doors, is of the greatest importance. In countries\nwhere there is little or no frost, an exposure to the\nnorth is the most favourable; and in cold climates a\nwestern exposure should be made choice of, because\nthe first rays of the rising sun have a very pernicious\neffect after frost. We are not, however, wholly to\nadopt the sentiment of M. Falconet with regard to the\npernicious effects of moisture on fresco paintings; for,\nI. The ancient paintings recovered from moist places,\nin which they were buried for many ages, have, under\nenormous heaps of earth, preserved all their colours.\nThose from the ruins of Herculaneum have been ob-\nserved,\nserved, on the contrary, to lose their colours in a short time after they have been dried by the exterior air.\n\n2. The mortar which composes the ground of this painting is not destroyed in our rainy climates. It is necessary frequently to use powder in removing pieces of this mortar, which are now found to obstruct some buildings in Paris.\n\nAfter the choice of place, the choice of materials is the next thing of importance in executing fresco. To make it durable, the ground is the object of chief attention; and to make this perfect, the mortar used by the ancients, now unknown, would be necessary.\n\nIt is easy to perceive, that a minute detail of forms, an extensive mixture and gradation of tints, and the merit of a delicate and gentle touch, can make no part of the excellencies of this kind of painting. It cannot bear a close examination like a picture in oil. There is always something dry and rough which displeases. An artist who would flatter himself with success in a fresco placed near the eye would be grossly deceived: a common spectator would find it coarse and badly finished.\n\nFresco is chiefly employed in palaces, temples, and public edifices. In these vast places no kind of painting can be preferred to it; large, vivid in its strokes, and constantly fresh, it enriches the architecture, animates it, and gives relief to the eye from the repetition of the same forms, and the monotony of colour in a place where coloured marbles and bronzes are not employed. Still more a fine fresco gives the greatest effect to a lofty building, since this building serves as a frame and support to this enchanting art, which fixes the attention of every person of sensibility and taste.\n\nWe shall afterwards have occasion to show the manner of executing fresco, as well as the nature and application of the colours employed in it: it is necessary to demonstrate here, that it has freshness, splendour, and vigour not to be found in oil or water colours.\n\nA known principle in all kinds of painting is, that the colouring is more perfect in proportion as it approaches to the lights and shades in nature. As colours applied to any subject can never reach this degree of perfection, the illusion which painters produce consists in the comparison and opposition of the tones of colours among themselves.\n\nIf the white of the finest and purest oil appears heavy and gray, compared with great lights in natural whites, it follows, that, in order to copy them with fidelity, the tones which follow the first white must be degraded in an exact proportion. Thus it is necessary that the shades of a picture be considerably deeper than those of the model; especially if, from the greatest lights to the browns, one hath proportionally followed the distance which is found between the colours on the pallet and the tones of the object copied.\n\nNow if the white of fresco be infinitely more bright than that of oil, the same effect will be obtained in a brown tone. On the other side, if it constantly happens that the brown tones of fresco are much more vigorous than those of water colours, and equal even to the browns of oil itself, it is certain that it possesses a splendour and vigour more extensive than any other kind of painting. Thus in the hands of an artist who is well acquainted with the colours fit for fresco, it is more susceptible of the general effect, and more capable than any other kind, of giving projection and the semblance of life to the figures.\n\nIf we were to inquire why painting in fresco is now scarcely or never practised, we should perhaps ascribe it to the great talents required to execute it. \"Many of our painters (says Vasi in his Treatise on Painting) excel in oil or water colours, and yet fail in fresco; because of all kinds this requires the greatest strength of genius, boldness in the strokes, and resolution.\" If in an age abounding in great matters, it was difficult to excel in this kind, it must be much more so in ours; but we should not require the characters of sublimity and style to which men were accustomed in the time of Vasari.\n\nWe should execute in fresco as we do in oils; for Italy herself, along with Michael Angelo and Zuccaro, had Cortonni Giardano and Franciabini as middling fresco painters. And in France, Laffitte, Bon-Boulogne, and Perier, performed several works in fresco which might be imitated by the painters of our times. But let us proceed to the real causes for abandoning this art. These proceed from the want of knowledge and taste in the persons who employ the artists, and from the manners of the age. As a pleasant or licentious conceit, unfinished colouring, and bold effects of shade, are the chief objects of consideration, a very smooth painting enlivened by gentle touches completely gratifies the person who pays the price; and therefore the philosophical principles of the art, which require study, are not cultivated.\n\nWe shall now attend to the mechanical process of this useful and beautiful kind of painting. Before painting, it is necessary to apply two layers. If the wall on which you are to paint is of brick, the layer is easily applied; but if it is of free stone closely united, it is necessary to make excavations in the stone, and to drive into them nails or pegs of stone in order to hold the first layer.\n\nThe first layer is made of good lime and a cement of pounded brick, or, which is still better, river sand: this latter forms a layer more uneven, and better fitted to retain the second smooth and polished layer applied to its surface.\n\nThere should be experiments to discover a layer still more compact, and more independent of the variations of the air; such for example, as covers the aqueducts and ancient reservoirs constructed by the Romans in the neighbourhood of Naples.\n\nBefore applying the second layer, or what you are to paint, it is necessary that the first be perfectly dry; for there issues from the lime, when it is moist, a smell both disagreeable and pernicious to the artist.\n\nWhen the first layer is perfectly dry, it is wet with water in proportion to its dryness, that the second layer may the more easily incorporate with it.\n\nThe second layer is composed of lime, flaked in the air, and exposed for a year, and of river sand, of an equal grain, and moderately fine.\n\nIt requires an active and intelligent mason to apply this layer, as the surface must be altogether equal. The operation is performed with a trowel; and the operator requires to have a small piece of wood to take away the large grains of sand, which, remaining, might render the surface uneven.\nTo give a fine polish to this layer, one ought to take a sheet of paper, apply it to the wall, and pass and repass the trowel over the paper. By this means the little inequalities which hurt the exactness of the stroke, and which produce false appearances at a distance, are entirely smoothed.\n\nThe artist must not lay more than the painter can finish in a day; as this kind of painting must be executed on a fresh ground.\n\nThe layer being thus prepared, the painter begins his operation; but as painting in fresco must be executed rapidly, and as there is no time to retouch any of the strokes, the painter, as we have observed under the article Fresco, takes care to provide himself with large cartoons, on which he has drawn, with exactness, and in their full size, the figures which he is to paint, which leaves him nothing to do but to copy them on the wall.\n\nThe cartoons are composed of several sheets of large paper pasted one on another, neither too thick nor too slender.\n\nThe painter traces the tracks of the figures on the plaster, by passing a steel point over the tracks in the cartoons, or in pricking them.\n\nHaving in this manner attained an exact and speedy drawing, it now remains to execute the painting.\n\nBut it is essential, when one wishes to finish any small work of this kind, in the first place to be informed of the proper colours, and of those which cannot be used.\n\nIn general, the colours which are extracted from earths, and those which have passed through the fire, are the only ones which can be employed in this kind of painting.\n\nThe colours are white, made of lime, the white of egg shells, ultramarine; the black of charcoal, yellow ochre, burnt vitriol, red earth, green of Verona, Venetian black, and burnt ochre.\n\nThere are others which require to be used with great precaution, such as enamel blue, cinnabar, and white marble dust.\n\nWhen enamel blue is used, it requires to be applied instantaneously, and when the lime is very moist, otherwise it does not incorporate with the plaster; and if one retouch with this colour, it must be done an hour or more after the first application, to increase its lustre.\n\nWith regard to the white marble dust, it is subject to turn black if it be not mixed up with a convenient quantity of white lime.\n\nCinnabar which has a splendour almost superior to all other colours, loses it almost entirely when mixed with lime. At the same time, it may be employed in places not exposed to the air, with a little degree of care in the preparation. Reduce a quantity of the purest cinnabar to powder, put it into an earthen vessel, and pour lime water on it for two or three times. By this process the cinnabar receives some impression of lime water, which makes it capable of being employed in fresco painting.\n\nOne of the best colours, and the one most used in fresco for the gradation of tints, and for giving the requisite tone, is white of lime. This white is prepared by mixing lime flaked long before with good water. The lime deposits a sediment at the bottom of the vessel; when the water is poured off, this sediment is the white of lime.\n\nAnother kind of white might be used, the effects of which would be known by experience, namely, the white of egg shells. To prepare this white, one must take a great quantity of shells of eggs, which must be pounded and boiled in water along with a quantity of quicklime; after this they are put into a strainer, and washed repeatedly with fountain water.\n\nThe shells are again pounded until the water employed for that purpose become pure and limpid; and when they are in this manner reduced to powder, this powder is ground in water, and formed into small pieces, and dried in the sun.\n\nAll the different kinds of ochres make excellent colours for fresco, and take different shades, being previously burned in iron chests.\n\nWith regard to the Naples yellow, it is dangerous to use it where the painting is much exposed to the air. The blacks of charcoal, of peach stones, and of vine twigs, are good; but that extracted from bones is of no value.\n\nRoman vitriol gathered at the furnaces, and which is called burnt vitriol, ground afterwards in spirit of wine, refills the air extremely well when employed in lime. There is also a red extracted from this preparation somewhat like that produced from lac.\n\nThis colour is very proper for preparing the layers to be coloured with cinnabar; and the draperies painted with these two colours will vie in splendour with those painted with fine lac in oil.\n\nThe ultramarine is the most faithful colour; and it not only never changes, but it communicates this precious quality to those colours with which it is mixed.\n\nThe manner of employing those colours, is to grind them in water, and to begin by arranging them into the principal tints you are to employ: these are afterwards put into pots; and it is necessary to use a great many pallets raised at the edges, to form the intermediate shades, and to have under your eye all the shades you require.\n\nAs all the tints, except burnt ochre, violet, red, and blacks of all kinds, are apt to become clear, the painter must have beside him some pieces of brick or new tile very dry. A dash of the colours is applied to one of these with the pencil before using them; and as the tile instantaneously imbibes the water, one perceives what the shade will be after the fresco is dry.\n\n§ 2. Eldoramic Painting, invented by M. Vincent of Montpetit.\n\nThis new kind of painting is little known, and capable of great improvement.\n\nIts principal advantages are, that the artist is able to give the greatest finishing possible to small figures in oil; to add to the mellowness of oil painting, the greatest beauty of water colours in miniature, and to do it in such a manner that it appears like a large picture seen through a glass which diminishes objects.\n\nThis kind of painting takes its name from two Greek words expressive of oil and water; because these two liquids are employed in the execution. The following is the manner of proceeding: A piece of very fine linen,\nlinen, or of white taffety, is sized with starch, in the most equal manner possible, on pieces of glass about two inches square, the angles of which are blunted in order that the cloth may cover them neatly and without wrinkles.\n\nWhen these pieces of cloth are sufficiently dry, a layer composed of white lead finely ground, and oil of pinks or of poppies, the whitest that can be found, is applied to them with a knife. When this layer is dry enough to admit of scraping, more may be applied if necessary.\n\nAs it is of the greatest importance for the preservation of this kind of painting, that the different layers be purged of oil, in order that they may imbibe the colours applied to them, it is necessary that their surface be very smooth, very dry, and very hard.\n\nThe artist is next provided with a circle of copper nearly two inches in diameter, one-fourth of an inch in height, extremely thin, and painted on the inside with black. This circle is employed to contain the water on the surface of the picture.\n\nThe preference is given to water distilled from rain or snow; because ordinary water, from the salts which it contains, is pernicious to this kind of painting.\n\nIt is necessary also to observe, that the colours must be ground between two oriental agates, most carefully preserved from dust, and mixed with oil of poppies, or any other fixative oil which has been extracted without fire, and pure as water.\n\nAll the colours being ground, they are placed in a small heap on a piece of glass, which is covered with distilled water in a tin box.\n\nWhen the materials are thus prepared, the subject is lightly traced on one of the pieces of cloth above-mentioned with a lead pencil.\n\nThe tints are formed on the pallets from the heaps of colours under the water, and the pallet placed as useful on the left arm with the thumb through the aperture.\n\nThe picture is held between the thumb and fore finger, supported by the middle, and the necessary pencils between the third and little fingers. The hand is supported on the back of a chair, that there may be full liberty of bringing the work near, or keeping it at a distance from the eye.\n\nThe pencils are cleaned with the essence of rectified turpentine.\n\nAfter having made the rough draught with the colours still fresh, the circle of copper, which ought to surround the picture, is fitted exactly to the surface.\n\nThe distilled water is poured within this circle to the height of one-eighth part of an inch; and the body is leaned forward till the sight fall perpendicularly on the object.\n\nThe third finger of the right hand must rest on the internal right angle of the picture.\n\nThe artist, with a fine and firm pencil, runs over the first draught, to give colours to the weak places, and to soften those which appear too strong.\n\nAs soon as the oil swims on the top, the water is poured off, and the picture is carefully covered with a watch glass, and dried in a box with a gentle heat.\n\nWhen it is sufficiently dry, to be scraped almost to a level with the knife; the above operation is renewed till the artist is satisfied with his work.\n\nIt is in this last work that the artist feels all the advantage of this new method for finishing.\n\nThe water poured on the picture discovers all the faults of the pencil, gives facility in searching into the bottom of the shades, and the power of correcting the work and of rendering it perfect.\n\nWhen the work is finished, it is put under a crystal, where there is no admission of external air, and dried with a gentle heat.\n\nPART III. OF ECONOMICAL PAINTING.\n\nSECT. I.\n\nTHE object of this Part is to give an account of some mechanical proceedings in certain kinds of painting, calculated to preserve and embellish the walls of houses and furniture. This branch of the art extends to every part of architecture. The whole building becomes the workshop of the artist; the stairs, the balustrades, the rafters, the doors, and the railing of all kinds, occupying his first care, and then the ceiling and wainscoting.\n\nThe artist gives to all his subjects a chosen and uniform tint; but he has it in his power to vary the colours on different parts of the building in such a manner as to produce the most pleasing objects.\n\nAmong the utensils of the painter, it is needless, but for rendering the article complete, to mention brushes and pencils of all sizes as absolutely necessary.\n\nThe brushes are made of boars bristles, or of hair with a mixture of bristles; they ought to be straight, very smooth, and of a round form. Half an hour before they are used, it is proper to soak them in water, in order to swell the wood of the handle, and prevent the hairs from falling off; after this they may be applied to all purposes, either in water colours or in oil; but it may be observed, that for the former they require less softening.\n\nThe pencils are made of badgers' hair, or any fine hairs enclosed in the pipes of quills of all sizes.\n\nThe vessel wherein the pencils are cleaned is made of copper or of tin, smooth below, rounded at the ends, and divided into two parts by a thin plate in the middle. The oil, or the substance with which the pencil is cleaned, is contained in one of the divisions.\n\nThe pallet is made of the wood of the pear or apple tree, of an oval or square shape, very slender, but somewhat thicker at the centre than at the extremities. A hole is made in one of its sides sufficiently large to admit the thumb of the workman.\n\nWhen the pallet is new, it is covered with oil of walnuts; and as often as it dries, the operation is repeated, till it be fully impregnated; it is afterwards polished, and finally rubbed with a piece of linen dipped in oil of common nuts.\n\nThe painter's knife is a thin flexible plate, equally slender\nPart III.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nApplication of Colours.\n\nAll the veils employed to hold the colours should be varnished; a precaution necessary to prevent their drying too quickly.\n\nTo grind, is to reduce to powder the substances which give colours on a piece of marble or any hard stone by means of water, oil, or essence.\n\nTo dilute, is to impregnate a liquid with a tint in such a manner as to make it capable of being applied by a brush.\n\nWhen the materials are ground in water, it is proper to dilute them in size made from parchment. If they are diluted in spirit of wine, there must be no more diluted than what serves the immediate occasion, as colours prepared in this manner dry very rapidly.\n\nColours grinded in oil are sometimes diluted with pure oil, more frequently with oil mixed with essence, and commonly with the pure essence of turpentine; the essence makes the colours easy to work. Those prepared in this manner are more solid, but they require more time to dry.\n\nWhen colours are grinded with the essence of turpentine, and diluted in varnish, as they require to be immediately applied, it is necessary to prepare a small quantity at a time. This preparation of colours gives greater brilliancy, and dries more speedily, than those prepared in oil; but they require more art to manage them.\n\nThey grind colours or coloured substances with a mallet, which is employed on the stone till they become a very fine powder. The operation is facilitated by moistening them from time to time with a little water, and by collecting them under the mallet with the knife. They are afterwards laid in small heaps on a sheet of white paper, and allowed to dry in a situation not exposed to dust. Those who grind white lead have a stone for the purpose, as this colour is very easily tarnished. In executing this part well, it is necessary to grind the colours equally and moderately; to grind them separately, and not to produce a tint by mixture till the colours are well prepared.\n\nDilute no more at a time than what you have occasion to employ, to prevent them from growing thick.\n\nIn grinding the colours, put in no more liquid than what is necessary to make the solid substances yield easily to the muller; the more the colours are ground, they mix better, and give a smoother and more agreeable painting.\n\nIt is also necessary to give all attention to the grinding and diluting of colours, that they may be neither too thick nor too thin.\n\nSect. II. Application of Colours.\n\n1. Prepare only the quantity necessary for the work you undertake, because they do not keep long; and those which are newly mixed are more vivid and beautiful.\n\n2. Hold the brush straight before you, and allow only the surface to be applied to the subject; if you hold it inclined in any other direction, you will run the hazard of painting unequally.\n\n3. It is necessary to lay on the colours boldly, and with great strokes; taking care at the same time to spread them equally over the surface, and not filling up the moulding and carved work. If this accident should happen, you must have a little brush to clean out the colours.\n\n4. Stir them frequently in the vessel, that they may preserve always the same tint, and that no sediment may remain at the bottom.\n\n5. Take care not to overcharge the brush with the colour.\n\n6. Never apply a second layer till the first or preceding one be perfectly dry; which it is easily known to be when, in bearing the hand gently over it, it does not adhere.\n\n7. In order to render this drying more speedy and uniform, make always the layers as thin as possible.\n\n8. Before painting, it is necessary to prime the subject; that is, to give it a layer of size, or of white colouring oil, to fill up the pores, and render the surface smooth: by this means fewer layers of colour or of varnish are afterwards necessary.\n\n9. Every subject to be painted or gilded ought to have first a white ground; this preserves the colours fresh and vivid, and repairs the damage which they occasionally receive from the air.\n\n§ I. Of Painting in Water Colours.\n\nTo paint in water colours, is to do it in those which are grinded in water and diluted in size. There are three kinds of this painting; namely common, the varnished, and that which is called king's white; but before entering on these, it is necessary to make some preliminary observations.\n\n1. Take care that there be no grease on the subject; and if there be, scrape it off, or clean it with a lye, or rub the greasy part with garlic and wormwood.\n\n2. Let the diluted colour fall in threads from the end of the brush when you take it out of the vessel; if it adheres to it, it is a proof that it wants size.\n\n3. Let all the layers, especially at the beginning, be laid on very warm, provided that the liquid be not boiling, which would effectually spoil the subject; and if on wood, expose it to crack. The last layer, given immediately before the varnish, is the only one which ought to be applied cold.\n\n4. In very fine work, where it is necessary to have beautiful and solid colours, the subjects are prepared by size and proper whites, which serve as a ground to receive the colour, and render the surface very equal and smooth.\n\n5. Whatever colour is to be laid on, the white ground is the best, as it affinuates most easily with the painting, which borrows always something of the ground.\n\n6. If knots of wood are found in the subject, it is necessary to rub them with garlic, to make the size adhere.\n\nTo make the following details sufficiently plain, we shall take the measures to which the quantity of colours are applied at fathoms; that is to say, six feet in height by five feet in breadth. We shall afterwards fix the quantity of materials, and of liquids, necessary to cover this surface. This, however, cannot be exactly defined; as some subjects imbibe the colours much more than others. The manner of employing them also makes a difference; as habit enables one to manage them to greater\ngreater advantage than another. And it is also to be observed, that the first layer will consume more than the second; and that a prepared subject requires less than one which has not been so.\n\nWhen we speak of a fathom, it must be understood of a smooth and equal surface; for if the wood is varied with mouldings and carving, there must be a difference in the quantity of colours. In general, it requires about a pound of colours to paint a square fathom in water colours. In making up this quantity, take three-fourths of colours grinded in water, and one-fourth pound, or six ounces, of size to dilute it.\n\n§ 2. Of Painting in Common Water Colours.\n\nWorks which require no great care or preparation, as cielings and staircases, are generally painted in common water colours, i.e. with earths infused in water and diluted in size.\n\nFor a common white kind of this painting, steep Spanish white moderately pounded in water for two hours. Infuse a proper quantity of the black of charcoal in water for the same space of time; mix the black and white in the proportion that the tint requires; afterwards mix them up with a pretty strong size sufficiently thick and warm, and apply them to the subject in as many layers as may be thought necessary. It requires about two pounds of white in a pint of water, and a quantity of black in proportion to the tint, together with a part of size, to cover a square fathom. If this be employed on old walls, they must be well scraped, the dust brushed off with a hair before, and washed carefully with lime water. If on new plaster, the colours require more size.\n\nAll kinds of colours may be grinded in water only when the tint is made; and when they have been infused in water, they must be mixed up with size.\n\n§ 3. Walls done with the White Des Carmes.\n\nThe white des carmes is a manner of whitening interior walls, whereby they are rendered extremely beautiful.\n\n1. Procure a quantity of the very best lime, and pass it through fine linen; pour it into a large tub, furnished with a spigot at the height equal to that which the lime occupies: fill the tub with clear fountain water; beat the mixture with great pieces of wood, and then allow it to settle for 24 hours.\n\n2. Open the spigot, allow the water to run off, supply the tub with fresh water, and continue this operation for several days until the lime receives the greatest degree of whiteness.\n\n3. When you allow the water finally to run off, the lime will be found in the confectionary of paste; but with the quantity you use it is necessary to mix a little Prussian blue or indigo to relieve the brightness of the white, and a small quantity of turpentine to give it brilliancy. The size proper for it is made of glove leather, with the addition of some alum; and the whole is applied with a strong brush in five or six layers to new plaster.\n\n4. The wall is strongly rubbed over with a brush of hogs bristles after the painting is dry; which gives it its lustre and value, and which makes it appear like marble or stucco.\n\n§ 4. Of Badegeon.\n\nBadegeon is a pale yellow colour applied to plaster to make it appear like free stones. It gives to old houses and churches the exterior of a new building, by assuming the colour of stones newly cut.\n\n1. Take a quantity of lime newly killed.\n\n2. Add to it half the quantity of what the French call feuvre de pierre in which you have mixed of the ochre of rue, according to the colour of the stone you intend to imitate.\n\n3. Steep the whole in a pail of water, in which is melted a pound of rock alum. When the feuvre de pierre cannot be obtained, it is necessary to use a greater quantity of ochre de rue, or of yellow ochre, or grind the scales of the flake de St Leu; pass it through a sieve; and along with the lime it will form a cement, on which the weather will scarcely make any impression.\n\n§ 5. Of Cielings and the Roofs of Rooms.\n\nWhen the cielings or roofs are new, and you wish to whiten them, take white of Bougival, to which add a little of the black of charcoal to prevent the white from growing reddish: infuse them separately in water; mix the whole with half water and half size of glove leather, which being strong would make the layer come off in rolls if it were not reduced with water. Give two layers of this tint while it is lukewarm.\n\nIf the roof has been formerly whitened, it is necessary to scrape to the quick all the remaining white; then give it two or three layers of lime to ground and whiten it: Bruise it carefully over; and give it two or three layers of the white of Bougival prepared as before.\n\n§ 6. Of Colouring the backs of Chimneys with Lead Ore.\n\nClean them with a very strong brush, and carefully rub off the dust and rust; pound about a quarter of a pound of lead ore into a fine powder, and put it into a vessel with half a pint of vinegar; then apply it to the back of the chimney with a brush: When it is made black with this liquid, take a dry brush, dip it in the same powder without vinegar, and dry and rub it with this brush till it become thinning as glass.\n\n§ 7. Of Varnished Water Colours.\n\nThe advantages of this kind of painting are, that the colours do not fade; that they reflect the light; that they give no offensive smell, but permit the places to be inhabited as soon as finished; and that the varnish preserves the wood from insects and moisture.\n\nTo make a fine varnish on water colours, seven principal operations are necessary, namely, to size the wood, to prepare the white, to soften and rub the subject, to clean the moulding, to paint, to size, and to varnish.\n\nTo size the wood is to give one or two layers of size to the subject which you intend to paint.\n\nTake three heads of garlic and a handful of wormwood leaves; boil them in three pints of water till they are reduced to one; pass the juice through a linen cloth, and mix it with a pint of parchment size; add half a handful of salt and half a pint of vinegar; and boil the whole on the fire.\nPart III.\n\nPAINTING.\n\nApplication of Colours.\n\nSize the wood with this boiling liquor; allow it to penetrate into the carved and smooth places of the wood, but take care at the same time to take it as clean off the work as possible, or at least to leave it at no place thicker than another. This first sizing serves to fill up the pores of the wood, and to prevent the materials afterwards from collecting in a body, which would cause the work to fall off in scales.\n\nIn a pint of strong parchment size, to which you have added four pints of warm water, put two handfuls of white Bougival, and allow it to infuse for the space of half an hour.\n\nStir it well, and give a single layer of it to the subject very warm but not boiling, equally and regularly laid on, and dashed with repeated strokes of the brush into the mouldings and carved work.\n\nTo prepare the white, take a quantity of strong parchment size, and sprinkle lightly over it with the hand, Bougival white, till the size be covered with it about half an inch in thickness; allow it to soak for half an hour as near the fire as to keep it milk warm; and then stir it with the brush till the lumps are broken and it be sufficiently mixed.\n\nGive seven, eight, or ten layers of this white, or as many as the nature of the work or the defects in the wood shall render necessary, giving more white to the parts which require to be softened; but in general, the layers must be equal both with regard to the quantity of the white and the strength of the size.\n\nThe last layer of the white ought to be clearer than the rest, which is made by adding water. It must be applied more slightly, taking care with small brushes to cover all the difficult places in the mouldings and carved work. It is necessary also, between the drying of the different layers, to fill up all the defects with white mastic and size.\n\nTo soften, is to give to the subject after the whitening a smooth and equal surface, and to rub it over with a pumice stone.\n\nThe wood being dry, take little pieces of white wood and of pumice stone, grinded for the purpose into all necessary forms, either for the panels or the moulding.\n\nTake cold water, heat being destructive of this kind of work; in summer it is common to add a little ice. Soften the wall with a brush, but only as much at a time as you can easily work, as the water might dilute the white and spoil the whole. Then smooth and rub it with the pumice stones and with the small pieces of wood. Wash it with a brush as you smooth it, and rub it over with a piece of new linen, which gives a fine lustre to the work.\n\nThe mouldings and carved work are cleaned with an iron; and the only thing to be attended to in the operation is not to raise the grain of the wood.\n\nThe subject thus prepared is ready to receive the colour you intend to give it. Choose your tint; suppose a silver colour.\n\nGrind white ceruse and Bougival white separately in water, of each an equal quantity, and mix them together.—Add a little blue of indigo and a very small quantity of black of charcoal from the vine tree very fine, grinded also separately, and in water; more or less of the one or other gives the tint you require.—Dilute this tint in strong parchment size; pass it through a bolting cloth of silk very fine, and lay the tint on your work, taking care to spread it very equally; and then give it two layers, and the colour is applied.\n\nMake a weak, beautiful, and clean size; stir it till it cools; strain it through a fine cloth, and give two layers to the work with a soft painting brush, which has been used, but which you have been careful to clean. Take care not to choke up the mouldings nor to lay on the size thicker on one place than another, and spread it over the work very slightly, otherwise you will dilute the colours, and occasion undulations in the painting.\n\nThe beauty of the work depends on this last sizing; for if any part is omitted, the varnish will penetrate into the colours and give it a darker shade.\n\nWhen the sizing is dry, lay on two or three layers of spirit of wine varnish, taking care that the place on which you lay it be warm, and the work is finished.\n\n§ 8. Of the King's White.\n\nThis derives its name from the use of it in the apartments of the French king. It is in all respects conducted like the former, except that there is only a small quantity of indigo, to take the yellow from the white, without any black of charcoal, and without varnish.\n\nThis white answers extremely well for apartments which are seldom used; but otherwise it spoils easily, especially in bedchambers. It is the best white where there is any kind of gilding; and in this case it receives a little varnish.\n\nSect. III. Of Painting in Oil Colours.\n\nTo paint in oil is to apply to all sorts of subjects, as walls, wood, cloths, and metals, coloured earths grinded and diluted in oil. The ancients are thought to have been ignorant of this art, and the honour of the discovery is generally ascribed to John Van Eyck a Flemish painter. The secret is nothing more than substituting oil in place of water in grinding and diluting colours.\n\nBy means of oil the colours are longer preserved; and not drying so speedily, they give painters longer time to smooth, finish, and retouch, their works; the colours being more marked, and mixing better together, give more distinguishable tints, and more vivid and agreeable gradations, and the colouring is more sweet and delicate.\n\nThe painting in oil consists of two kinds, namely, of that in simple oil and of that in polished oil varnish.\n\n§ 1. Observations on Painting in Oil.\n\n1. When bright colours, as white or gray, are ground and diluted in oil, it is necessary to make use of the oil of walnuts; but if the colours be dark, such as chestnut, or olive, or brown, you must make use of pure linseed oil.\n\n2. When the colours are ground and diluted in oil, they must be laid on cold except on a new or moist plaster, which requires them to be boiling.\n\n3. Every colour diluted in pure oil, or in oil mixed with essence, ought to fail in threads from the end of the brush.\n\n4. Take care to stir from time to time your colours before\nPainting in before taking it up on the brush, that it may preserve an equal thickness, and consequently the same tone.\n\nNotwithstanding the precaution of fluming, if it is found to be thicker towards the bottom, it will be necessary to pour in from time to time a little oil.\n\n5. In general, every subject which is painted in oil ought first to receive one or two layers of white ceruse, grinded and diluted in oil.\n\n6. When the painting is exposed to the air, as in doors, windows, and other works, which cannot be varnished, it is necessary to make these layers with pure oil of walnuts, mixed up with about one ounce of essence to a pound of colours; more would make the colours brown, and occasion them to fall off in dust; but this quantity prevents the sun from blistering the work.\n\n7. In subjects on the inside of the house, or when the painting is varnished, the first layer ought to be grinded and diluted in oil, and the last diluted with pure essence.\n\n8. If copper or iron, or other hard substances, are to be painted, it is necessary to mix a little essence with the first layers, to make the oil penetrate into them.\n\n9. When there are many knots in the subject, as is particularly the case with fir wood, and when the colour does not easily take impression on these parts, it is necessary, when you paint with simple oil, to lay on a little oil mixed with litharge on the knots. If you paint with polished oil varnish, it is necessary to apply a hard tint, which we shall have occasion to speak of afterwards. A single layer well applied is generally sufficient to give a body to the wood, and make the other layers apply easily.\n\n10. There are colours, such as what the French call \"lids-de-grain,\" black of charcoal, and especially bone and ivory blacks, which are difficult to dry when grinded in oil. To remedy this inconvenience, the following fixatives are mixed with the colours, to make them dry, viz. litharge both of the silver and gold colour, vitriol or copperas, and what is called fixative oil.\n\n§ 2. Observations on the Fixatives.\n\n1. Do not mix the fixatives with the colours till they are to be employed, otherwise it will thicken them.\n\n2. Mix it only in very small quantities in tin, where there is white lead or ceruse, because those colours are fixatives of themselves, especially when they are diluted in essence.\n\n3. In painting which is to be varnished, give the fixative only to the first layer, and allow the other layers, in which there is essence, to dry of themselves.\n\n4. In dark colours in oil, give to every pound of colours in diluting them half an ounce of litharge; to bright colours, a drachm of white copperas grinded in walnut oil.\n\n5. When in place of litharge or copperas the fixative oil is employed, it requires a quarter of this oil to every pound of colour.\n\nThe fixative oil is prepared of one half ounce of litharge, as much of calcined ceruse, as much of terre d'ombre, a colour with which the French paint shadows, and as much of talc boiled for two hours on a slow and equal fire, with one pound of linseed oil, and stirred the whole time. It must be carefully skimmed and clarified, and the older it grows it is better.\n\n§ 3. Observations on the Quantities of Substances and Liquids.\n\n1. Ochres and earths require more liquids both in grinding and diluting than ceruse.\n\n2. Different quantities of liquids are required in the grinding only on account of greater or less dryness; but in diluting, the quantity is always the same.\n\n3. For the first layer after the priming, which has no relation to the colours laid on afterwards, to a square fathom give fourteen ounces of ceruse, about two ounces of liquid to grind, and four ounces to dilute it. If there is a second layer of the same materials, the quantities will require to be less.\n\n4. It will require three pounds of colour for three layers of a square fathom. The first may consume eighteen ounces, the second sixteen, and the third fourteen.\n\n5. To compose these three pounds of colour, take two or two and a half pounds of grinded colours, and dilute them in a pint or three half pints of oil, mixed with essence or pure oil. But if the first layer of ceruse is not used, there will be a necessity for a greater quantity of colours.\n\nN.B. In the following kinds and applications of oil painting, we are to hold those proportions in our eye.\n\n§ 4. Painting in Simple Oil.\n\nOn doors and windows give a layer of ceruse grinded. Of doors, in oil of walnuts diluted in the same oil, together with windows, a little fixative; then give another layer of the same preparation; to which, if you want a grayish colour, add a little black of charcoal and Prussian blue, grinded also in oil of walnuts. If to these you incline to add a third layer, grind and dilute it in pure walnut oil; observing that the two last layers be less clear, or have less oil in them, than the first; the colour in this case is more beautiful and less apt to blister with the sun.\n\nWalls that are to be painted must be very dry; and this being supposed, give two or three layers of boiling linseed oil to harden the plaster; then lay on two layers of ceruse or ochre, grinded and diluted in linseed oil; and when these are dry, paint the wall.\n\nTo paint tiles of a flat colour, grind separately ceruse and German black in linseed oil; mix them together in the proportion which the colour requires, and dilute them in linseed oil; then give the first layer very clean to prime the tiles; and make the three next layers thicker, to give solidity to the work.\n\nTo paint arbours and all kinds of garden work, give a layer of white ceruse grinded in oil of walnuts, and se. diluted in the same oil, with the addition of a little litharge, then give two layers of green, composed of one pound of verdigris and two pounds of white lead, grinded and diluted in oil of walnuts. N.B. This green is of great service in the country for doors, window shutters, arbours, garden seats, rails, either of wood or iron; and in short for all works exposed to the injuries of the weather.\n\nTo whiten statues, vases, and all ornaments of stone, either within or without doors; first clean the subject and vases well,\nPainting in wall, then give one or two layers of white cerule, grinded and diluted in pure oil of pinks, and finish with giving one or many layers of white lead prepared in the same manner.\n\nIf you wish to paint on walls not exposed to the air, or on new plaster, give one or two layers of boiling linseed oil, and continue the brush till the walls are fully soaked; then give a layer of white cerule, grinded in oil of walnuts, and diluted with three-fourths of the same oil and one-fourth essence; and lastly, give two layers more of white cerule, grinded in oil of walnuts and diluted in oil mixed with essence, if it is not to be varnished; but in pure essence if it is. It is in this manner that walls are painted white. If you adopt another colour, it is necessary to grind and dilute it in the same quantities of oil and essence.\n\nTo paint chairs, benches, stone, or plaster, give a layer of white cerule grinded in oil of walnuts and diluted in the same oil, into which you have cast a little litharge to make it dry; then apply a layer of the tint you fix on, grinded in oil and diluted in one part oil and three parts essence; and afterwards give two more layers of the same tint grinded in oil and diluted in pure essence: This may be varnished with two layers of spirit of wine.\n\nTo make a steel colour, grind separately in essence, white cerule, Prussian blue, fine lac, and verdigris. The tone which you require is procured by the proper mixture of those ingredients. When you have fixed on the tone of colour, take about the size of a walnut of the ingredients, and dilute them in a small vessel in one part of essence and three parts of white oily varnish. N.B. This colour is generally made of white cerule, of black charcoal, and Prussian blue, grinded in thick oil, and diluted in essence, which is the cheapest method of procuring it; but the former is the most beautiful.\n\nFor painting balustrades and railings, dilute lamp black with varnish of vermilion; giving two layers of it, and afterwards two layers of spirit of wine varnish.\n\nSince the discovery of oil painting, and the knowledge that wood is preserved by it, and especially since the discovery of a varnish without flinell, and which even takes away that of oil, the painting of apartments in oil has been with justice preferred.\n\nIn fact the oil stops up the pores of the wood; and although it does not altogether resist the impression of moisture, yet the effect is so little perceptible, that it is to be recommended as the best method of preserving wood.\n\nTo preserve wainscoting in the most effectual manner from moisture, it is necessary to paint the wall behind it with two or three layers of common red, grinded and diluted in linseed oil.\n\nTo paint the wainscoting itself, give a layer of white cerule grinded in oil of walnuts, and diluted in the same oil mixed with essence. This layer being dry, give two more of the colour you have adopted, grinded in oil and diluted in pure essence. If you wish the mouldings and sculpture to be painted in a different colour, grind and dilute it in the same manner.\n\nTwo or three days after, when the colours are fully dry, give two or three layers of your white varnish without flinell, and which also prevents the offensive flinell of the oil colours. N.B. Those who begin their operations in water colours, if they find it more agreeable, may finish it in oil colours as above.\n\nWhen the pores of the wood are well stopped by the prepared white, a layer of white cerule grinded in oil of walnuts, and diluted in the same oil, mixed with essence, may be applied. This will be sufficient, the wood being previously primed; and afterwards lay on your intended colour and varnish.\n\n§ 5. Painting in Oil with the polished Varnish.\n\nThis is the best kind of oil painting, owing more to the care it requires than to the proceedings, for they are nearly the same with those of simple oil painting; the difference consisting only in the preparation and manner of finishing.\n\nTo paint wainscottings of apartments with the polished varnish, it is necessary, in the first place, that the tings, panels be new. Then,\n\n1. Make the surface of the subject which you mean to paint very smooth and level, which is done by a layer, which serves to receive the hard tint or polished ground and the colours.\n\nThis layer ought to be of white, whatever colour you are afterwards to apply. It consists of white cerule, grinded very fine in linseed oil, with a little litharge, and diluted in the same oil mixed with essence.\n\n2. Make the polished ground by seven or eight layers of the hard tint. In painting equipages, a dozen is necessary.\n\nThe hard tint is made, by grinding pure white cerule, which has not been much calcined, very finely in thick oil, and diluting it with essence. You must take care that the layers of the hard tint be not only equal as to the application, but to the quantity of the white cerule and the oil, and to the degree of calcination.\n\nThen,\n\n3. Soften this ground with pumice stone.\n\n4. Polish it moderately with a piece of serge soaked in a pail of water, in which you have put some powder of pumice stone finely grinded and passed through a fine sieve. There is no occasion to spare washing, as this part of the operation will not spoil with water.\n\n5. Choose the tint with which you intend to decorate your apartment; grind it in oil, and dilute it in essence; pass it through a piece of very fine silk, give two or three layers carefully and thinly spread over the surface, as on this part of the operation depends in a great measure the beauty of the colour. All sorts of colours may be employed in this manner in oil of essence.\n\n6. Give two or three layers of a spirit of wine varnish, if it is to wainscoting; if to the body of a coach, a varnish of oil is employed. If the varnish is to be polished, it is necessary to give seven or eight layers at least, laid on equally and with great precaution, not to be thicker in one place than another, which occasions spots.\n\n7. It is again polished with pumice stone reduced to powder, and water and a piece of serge. If the wainscoting has been painted before, it is necessary to rub off the colour till you come to the hard tint, which is done with pumice stone and water, or with a piece of linen dipped in essence.\n\nThere is a white painting in oil, called white varnish, which corresponds to the king's white in water with polish.\nPainting in Oil Colours\n\n1. Give a layer of white ceruse grinded in oil of walnuts, with a little calcined copperas, and diluted in essence. But if it is applied to stone, it is necessary to employ oil of walnuts and calcined copperas alone.\n\n2. Grind white ceruse very fine in essence, and dilute it in fine white oil varnish with copal.\n\n3. Give seven or eight layers of it to the subject.—The varnish mixed with the white ceruse dries so promptly, that three layers of it may be given in a day.\n\n4. Soften and polish all the layers as above.\n\n5. Give two or three layers of white lead grinded in oil of walnuts, and diluted in pure essence.\n\n6. Give seven or eight layers of white spirit of wine varnish, and then polish them.\n\n§ 6. Of Painting in Varnish.\n\nTo paint in varnish, is to employ colours grinded and diluted in varnish, either in spirits of wine or oil, on all sorts of subjects. Wainscoting, furniture, and equipments, are painted in this manner, though we shall confine ourselves to the first.\n\n1. Give two layers of white of Bougival, diluted in a strong size boiling hot.\n\n2. Give a layer of what the French call de blanc apprécier.\n\n3. Fill up the defects of the wood with mastic in water; and when the layers are dry, smooth them with the pumice stone.\n\n4. When the wood is smooth, suppose the paint a gray colour, take one pound of white ceruse, one dram of Prussian blue, or of black of charcoal or ivory black; put the white into a piece of leather, so tied that the colours cannot escape; shake them till they are sufficiently mixed.\n\n5. Put two ounces of colours into a quartern of varnish; mix them carefully; give one layer above the white.\n\n6. This layer being dry, put one ounce of colours into the same quantity of varnish as above, and give a second layer.\n\n7. To the third layer give half an ounce of colour to the same quantity of varnish.\n\n8. As each of these layers dry, be careful to rub them with a piece of new coarse cloth, in such a manner, however, as not to injure the colour. N.B. The three layers may be given in one day.\n\n9. If you want to give a perfect lustre, add a fourth layer prepared as the third.\n\nAll other colours, as blue, &c. may be applied in the same manner. This method is the only one by which orpiment can be employed in all its beauty, but not without some of its inconveniences.\n\nAnother manner of performing this kind of work, is to apply the colours and the varnish without previously using the size and the white ground. This is extremely expeditious, but it is easy to perceive it will want the polish and brilliancy of the other.\n\nSect. IV.\n\nWe cannot perhaps more properly conclude this article, than with an account of M. de Morveau's attempts to render more perfect the proportion of colours, and especially of white, employed in painting. These we shall extract from a memoir of his read in the academy of Dijon.\n\n\"White (says the ingenious academician) is the most important of all colours in painting. It affords to the painter the materials of light, which he distributes in such a manner as to bring his objects together, to give them relief, and that magic which is the glory of his art. For these reasons I shall confine my attention at present to this colour.\n\n\"The first white which was discovered, and indeed examined, the only one yet known, is extracted from the calx of lead. The danger of the process, and the dreadful di-known temper with which those employed in it are often feigned, whites, have not yet led to the discovery of any other white. Let us anxious, indeed, about the danger of the artist than the perfection of the art, they have varied the preparation, to render the colour less liable to change. Hence the different kinds of white, viz. white of crems in Austria, white lead in shells, and white ceruse. But every person conversant in colours, knows that the foundation of all these is the calx of lead, more or less pure, or more or less loaded with gas. That they all participate of this metallic substance, will indeed appear evident from the following experiment, which determines and demonstrates the alterability of colours by the phlogistic vapour.\n\n\"I poured into a large glass bottle a quantity of liver of sulphur, on a basis of alkali, fixed or volatile, it makes no difference; I added some drops of distilled vinegar, and I covered the mouth of the bottle with a piece of pasteboard cut to its size, on which I disposed different samples of crems, of white lead, and of ceruse, either in oil or in water; I placed another ring of pasteboard over the first, and tied above all a piece of bladder round the neck of the bottle with a strong pack-thread. It is evident, that in this operation I took advantage of the means which chemistry offers to produce a great quantity of phlogistic vapour, to accomplish instantaneously the effect of many years; and, in a word, to apply to the colours the very same vapours to which the picture is necessarily exposed, only more accumulated and more concentrated. I say the same vapour, for it is now fully established, that the smoke of candles, animal exhalations of all kinds, alkaline odours, the electric effluvia, and even light, furnish continually a quantity more or less of matter, not only analogous, but identically the same with the vapour of vitriolic acid mixed with sulphur.\n\n\"If it happens that the samples of colours are sensibly altered by the phlogistic vapour, then we may conclude with certainty, that the materials of which the colours are composed, bear a great affinity to that vapour; and since it is not possible to preserve them entirely from it in any situation, that they will be more or less affected with it, according to the time and a variety of circumstances.\n\n\"After some minutes continuance in this vapour, I examined the samples of colours submitted to its influence, and found them wholly altered. The ceruse and the white lead both in water and oil were changed into black; and the white of crems into a brownish black; and hence those colours are bad, and ought to be abandoned. They may indeed be defended in some measure by varnish; but this only retards for a time the contact\nPainting in of the phlogistic vapour; for as the varnish loses its hue, it opens an infinite number of palliages to this fluid.\n\n\"After having ascertained the instability of the whites in common use, I made several attempts to discover such as would prove more lasting; and though many of these attempts were without effect, I shall give a succinct account of the whole, which may save a great deal of trouble to those who wish to travel over the same field.\n\n\"There are three conditions essential to a good colour in painting:\n\n\"First, That it dilute easily, and take a body both with oils and with mucilages, or at least with the one or other of these substances, a circumstance which depends on a certain degree of affinity. Where this affinity is too strong, a dissolution ensues; the colour is extinguished in the new composition, and the mass becomes more or less transparent; or else the sudden re-action absorbs the fluid, and leaves only a dry substance, which can never again be softened. But if the affinity is too weak, the particles of colour are scarcely suspended in the fluid, and they appear on the canvas like sand, which nothing can fix or unite.\n\n\"The second condition is, That the materials of which colours are composed do not bear too near an affinity with the phlogistic vapour. The experiments to which I submitted whites from lead, is an infallible means of ascertaining the quality of colours in this respect, without waiting for the slow impression of time.\n\n\"A third condition equally essential is, That the colouring body be not volatile, that it be not connected with a substance of a weak texture, susceptible of a spontaneous degeneracy. This consideration excludes the greater part of substances which have received their tint from vegetable organization; at least it makes it impossible to incorporate their finer parts with a combination more solid.\n\n\"After these reflections, my researches were directed, first, to the five pure earths; next, to the earthy compounds; in the third place, to the earthy salts, which can scarcely be dissolved; lastly, to the metallic earths, either pure or precipitated by Prussian alkali. M. Wenzel has discovered a fifth earth, which I call eburne, and which, after other experiments, I thought of applying to the purposes of painting; but I soon perceived that it would have the same fault with other kinds of earth, and besides, that it could not be obtained but at a very considerable expense.\n\n\"The five pure earths possess fixity in a very great degree, and at the same time are little affected by the phlogistic vapour; but they refuse to unite with oil or mucilages, and the white is totally extinguished when they are grinded with these liquids. I made several attempts on earth from alum, not only because M. Beaumé recommended the use of it in painting, and because it enters into the composition of Prussian blue, but also because it is a chief ingredient in ochres, and other earths of that nature, which supposes that it should unite in a certain degree with diluting liquids; notwithstanding, in whatever manner I treated it, it would not yield a white; but one will be less surprised at this want of success, when he considers, that in the ochres and Prussian blue, the earth from alum is only the vehicle of the colouring body, whereas here it is the colour itself.\n\n\"To be convinced of the truth of this observation, it is only necessary to mix equal parts of this earth, or even of clay not coloured, with cerule or any other white: the mixture will be susceptible of being grinded in oil or in gum without being extinguished; it will easily unite with any coloured substance, and be productive of no bad consequences to the pure earths.\n\n\"Nature and art present to us a considerable number of earthy compositions sufficiently white for the purposes of painting; such as the jasper white, the feldspar white, the schirr white, &c. But all these substances, in all the trials which I made, had the fault which I have already mentioned; and originating from the same cause, they wanted a fixed colouring body, which would not change when it is pulverized, nor be extinguished when it is diluted.\n\n\"The ultramarine blue, which is extracted from the blue jasper, and known by the name of lapis lazuli, seems at first view to warrant the possibility of appropriating to painting all the opaque half vitrified compositions of the nature of jasper.\n\n\"Prepossessed with this idea, I conceived the hope of producing a true white lapis; but I soon perceived that the experiment confirmed the principle which I had laid down from my observations on pure earths; since it is not the substance peculiar to the jasper which constitutes the ultramarine blue, but the metallic substance which accidentally colours this particular kind of jasper.\n\n\"In the same manner, art in this imitation of nature should have for its object to give a permanent base to a colour already formed, to fix it without altering, and to augment perhaps its splendour and its intensity, without attempting to produce a colour.\n\n\"In excepting from earthy and metallic salts all those of which the acid is not completely saturated, which would easily attract the humidity of the air, or which would be easily dissolved, you have but a very small number to make experiments on.\n\n\"The natural and artificial selenite gives with oil a paste without colour, and tasting somewhat like honey; its white is better preserved with a gum, but even in this case it resembles a half transparent pap.\n\n\"The natural or regenerated heavy spar is the most likely to fail to produce white. As it is of all others the most difficult to dissolve, it appears after pulverization to be a very fine white, but is scarcely touched with oil when it becomes gray and half transparent; the mucilage alters it also, although less discernibly; and it does not even resume its white colour after it becomes dry on the canvas.\n\n\"The same is the case with calcareous borax, formed by the solution of borax in lime water; its white is completely extinguished with oil, less so with gum; but it hardens so instantaneously with the latter, that it is impossible ever to dilute it again.\n\n\"Calcareous tartar, obtained by casting quicklime into a boiling solution of cream of tartar, is affected with oil in the same manner as selenite, but with mucilaginous water it gives a pretty good white, only possessed of little reflection, and appearing like plaster; it applied very well to the canvas, and resisted the phlogistic vapour.\n\n\"According to M. Weber, in his work entitled Fabriken und Kunst, published 1781, the white, called in Germany kremfer weiss, is nothing but the vitriol...\"\nPainting in lead, prepared by dissolving lead in nitrous acid, and precipitating it in vitriolic acid; and forming it afterwards into solid tablets by means of gum water.\n\nIt is certain that this resembles in no shape the white called in France the white of crems; at least I never found that it could be dissolved in vinegar; but I tried the white prepared in M. Weber's manner, and the result was the same as above, that is to say, it turned completely black.\n\n\"The vitriols of lead and of bismuth alter more speedily than the calces of those metals. And thus, with the exception of calcareous tartar, which may be of some use in water colours, the best earthy salts on which I have made experiments, may all, or the most of them, give a base to some colours, but cannot constitute by themselves a colour useful in painting.\n\n\"Of the fifteen known metallic substances, there are nine which yield white calces: namely, silver, mercury, lead, tin, antimony, bismuth, zinc, arsenic, and manganese.\n\n\"Of these nine substances, we may almost pass over silver and mercury; because, though they yield a very fine white, precipitated by means of crystallized vegetable alkali, yet it is soon altered when exposed to the air; that from silver changing into black, and that from mercury into yellow.\n\n\"It is well known that lead gives a very good white, and one which unites easily with oil or size; but that it is extremely liable to change, has been my principal object to prove, and the experiments which I have made place it beyond contradiction.\n\n\"I shall only add, that if there is a preparation able to correct this fault, it should be the precipitation of the earth of this metal in its acetous dissolution by Prussian alkali; but the white which results from this preparation becomes sensibly brownish when it is exposed a few minutes only to the phlogistic vapour.\n\n\"It would be therefore unreasonable to persevere in the use of this substance, or to wish to render it fixed, since the changes which it undergoes do not alter its nature, and the indestructible order of its affinities.—The calx of tin is easily applied to any purpose, and experiences no change from the concentrated phlogistic vapour. These considerations induced me to endeavour to obtain this calx perfectly white; and here follows the result of my operations: The tin calcined gives a pretty white calx; but whatever attention I paid to take off the red surface which the violence of the fire occasioned, a shade of gray always appears when it is diluted. Tin calcined by nitre in fusion, gives a tarntished and grey calx, which multiplied washings could not deprive of a yellowish tint.\n\n\"Having precipitated, by means of crystallized vegetable alkali, a solution of English tin, which had been made in the muriatic acid, after the manner of M. Bayen to extract the arsenic, I had a calx of the greatest whiteness, so light that it buoyed up to the surface of the liquor, and to this that the greater part of it passed through the filter; but it experienced at the same time a kind of adherence with the salts, which makes the part of it retained by the filter incapable of being pulverized, gummy, half transparent, and even a little changed into yellow. In this condition it is extinguished when diluted; it is necessary, therefore, to moisten it in boiling water, and afterwards to calcine slightly the sediment after it has had sufficient time to settle.\n\n\"I have tried the calcination by means of moisture, in employing the tin of the purest melaç, and a rectified nitrous acid, according to the method of Meyer. It formed a very white sparkling calx, which remained in the filter in the consistence of jelly.—Meanwhile, I observed that it was always a little yellow by the mixture of a portion of that earth which took, in the operation, the colour of turbit mineral.\n\n\"A very fine white calx is extracted from antimony, calcined by nitre in fusion; but the earth of this semi-metal must be placed in the number of those which combine too easily with the phlogistic vapour. The diaphoretic antimony, ground in oil, took in ten minutes in my phlogistic apparatus a colour somewhat like sulphur.\n\n\"The property of bismuth to give a very fine white calx, known by the name of magilery, or white fard, is generally known; it is easily prepared, since it is only necessary to dissolve the solution by pure water: it dilutes perfectly with oil and mucilages. But this colour ought to be rejected, as the most alterable by the phlogistic vapour. It became completely black in ten minutes in my apparatus; and this fact is also proved from what happens to women who use this colour, when they are exposed to the vapours of sulphur, of garlic, or of any putrid substances.\n\n\"Zinc furnishes by all the processes of calcination and precipitation a pretty white calx, when it is pure and separated from iron; otherwise the solutions of the vitriol of zinc will become yellow when exposed to the air. I have precipitated those solutions by lime water, by caustic, and effervescing alkalies; I have calcined this semi-metal alone and with nitre; and in all those operations I have obtained an earthy substance of different degrees of whiteness, which, after it was dried and prepared, mixed readily with oil and mucilages without losing its colour; and which experienced no sensible change when exposed to the phlogistic vapour.\n\n\"These valuable properties, the chief object of my researches, engaged me to multiply my experiments to determine at once the most economical process, and the most advantageous and infallible preparation.—Those attempts have convinced me, that the calcination of this semi-metal alone in a crucible, placed horizontally on the corners of a reverberating furnace, gives the purest, the whitest, and the least reducible calx; and that to make an excellent colour, it is sufficient to separate the parts not burned with water, and grind it with a little of the earth of alum or chalk to give it a body. Zinc precipitated in Prussian alkali, even in distilled vinegar, retains always a shade of yellow, does not unite so well in oil, and takes a demi-transparent consistence like cheese.\n\n\"White arsenic extinguishes much less in diluting than one would believe from its saline nature; it preserves its colour best in gum water; and it is remarkable, that instead of turning black in the phlogistic vapour, it takes a very distinct shade of yellow. This property is sufficiently singular and constant to furnish a new method of analyzing arsenic, so as to know it. And this alteration of colour makes it of no use.\"\nPainting in painting, although its deleterious qualities did not forbid the practice.\n\n\"The semi-metal known by the name of manganese, gives also a white calx. I had at first great hopes from this colour, as, contrary to all those extracted from the other metals, it became white by the phlogistic vapour. There remained, therefore, but one difficulty to overcome, viz. to separate from the manganese the portion of iron which it usually contained, and which infallibly makes the earth a little yellow. To accomplish this in the cheapest manner, I submitted the black ore of the manganese to a long calcination to render its iron insoluble; I afterwards applied vinegar to it, after the example of M. de la Peyrouse; and in precipitating the solution by effervescent alkali, I easily obtained a pure white precipitate. But I soon perceived that the facility with which a colouring body loses its phlogiston, no less an inconvenience than that of attracting it, and productive of the same alterations.\n\n\"The white of manganese became very soon yellow when exposed to the air; and this is not to be ascribed to the iron contained in it, since neither the galls nor Prussian alkali had discovered any of it in the solution. This substance, therefore, can be of no use in producing a white colour for painting.\"\n\nThe experiment by which M. de Morveau tried the colours not alterable by the phlogistic vapour, was performed before the academy, the prince of Condé being president. \"I placed (says he) in my apparatus pieces of cloth, on which were laid the white of calcareous tartar in water, different preparations of white from tin and zinc, in oil and water; and I allowed them to continue exposed to the phlogistic vapour during a fitting of the academy; if they were not altered, their superiority over the whites in use would be sufficiently established. The fitting continued for near an hour; and the bottle having been opened, all the colours continued to have the same shade which they had before. I can, therefore, recommend to painters those three whites, and particularly that of zinc, the preparation of which is exposed to less variation, the shade more lively and uniform, and moreover it is fit for all purposes, and perhaps procured at less expense.\n\n\"I will assert farther, that it may be procured in sufficient quantities to supply the place of ceruse in every branch of the art, even in interior house painting;—I would recommend it, less with the view of adding new splendour to this kind of ornament, than for the safety of those who are employed in it, and perhaps for the safety of those who inhabit houses ornamented in this manner.\n\n\"But, without being too sanguine, although the processes in the fabrication be simplified in proportion to the demand, as is usually the case, yet there is reason to apprehend that the low price of ceruse will always give it the preference in house-painting. With regard to those who apply colours to nobler purposes, they will not hesitate to employ the white of zinc. I am assured that four francs is paid for the pound of the white of crests; and I believe the white in question, prepared in the manner which I have pointed out, might be sold for five.\n\n\"M. Courtois, connected with the laboratory of the academy, has already declared that it is used for house-painting; less, however, in regard to its unalterability, than to its solubility; and this can be the more readily be believed, as the flower of zinc enters into many compositions of the apothecary. The fame M. Courtois has arrived at the art of giving more body to this white, which the painters seemed to desire, and also of making it bear a comparison with white lead either in water or oil. The only fault found with it, is its drying slowly when used in oil; but some experiments which I have made, incline me to believe that this fault may be easily remedied, or at least greatly corrected, by giving it more body. At any rate, it may be rendered fixative at pleasure, by adding a little vitriol of zinc or copperas slightly calcined.\n\n\"Painters already know the properties of this salt, but perhaps they do not know that it mixes with the white of zinc better than with any other colour; the reason is, they have chemically the same base. It is prepared by purging the white copperas of that small portion of iron which would render it yellow; and this is easily done in digesting its solution, even when cold, on the filings of zinc.\n\n\"The mixture of this salt thus prepared is made on the pallet, without producing any alteration, and a small quantity will produce a great effect.\"\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nWe shall here add an account of some processes which have been recommended, on account of their cheapness, for preparing different materials for economical painting. The first is a method of house painting with milk, by Cadet de Vaux*. The following are the directions for preparing this paint.\n\n\"Take of skimmed milk a pint, which makes two pints of Paris, or nearly two quarts English; fresh flaked lime, six ounces, (about five and a half ounces avoirdupois); oil of caraways, or linseed, or nut, four ounces; Spanish white (whiting) three pounds: put the lime into a stone-ware vessel, and pour upon it a sufficient quantity of milk to make a mixture resembling thin cream; then add the oil a little at a time, stirring it with a small spatula; the remainder of the milk is then to be added, and lastly, the Spanish white. Skimmed milk in summer is often clotted, but this is a circumstance of no consequence to our object, because the contact with the lime soon restores its fluidity. But it must on no account be four, because in that case it would form with the lime a kind of calcareous acetite, capable of attracting moisture.\n\n\"The lime is flaked by dipping it in water, out of which it is to be immediately taken, and left to fall in pieces in the air.\n\n\"The choice of either of these oils is indifferent; nevertheless for white paint the oil of caraways is to be preferred, because colourless. The commonest oils may be used for painting with the ochres.\n\n\"The oil when mixed in with the milk and lime disappears, and is totally dissolved by the lime, with which it forms a calcareous sope.\n\n\"The Spanish white is to be crumbled, or gently spread on the surface of the fluid, which it gradually imbibes, and at last sinks; at this period it must be well stirred in. This paint may be coloured like distemper (or size colour) with levigated charcoal, yellow ochre, &c.\n\n\"And\n\"And it is used in the same manner:\n\n\"The quantity here prescribed is sufficient for the first coat of six toises, or 27 square yards English.\n\n\"The price of this quantity amounts to nine sols, which reduces the price of the square toise to one sol, six deniers, prime cost.\"\n\nAnd to give this paint a greater degree of solidity, that it may be employed as a substitute for oil paint, the author adds to the proportions of the paint for out-door works, of flaked lime, oil, white Burgundy pitch, each two ounces. The pitch is to be melted with a gentle heat in the oil, and then added to the smooth mixture of the milk and lime. In cold weather this mixture is to be warmed, that it may not occasion too speedy cooling of the pitch, and to facilitate its union with the milk of lime. This paint, it is said, has some analogy with that known by the name of encyclopaedic. It has been employed, the author informs us, for outside shutters, formerly painted with oil, and is preferable to painting with lead, objects that are exposed to putrid exhalations, which are apt to blacken paint composed of metallic matters, especially of lead.\n\nA method has been proposed by Mr Vanherman, for making cheap and durable paints with fish oil. The paints thus prepared, before their cheapness, are not subject to blister or peel off by exposure to the weather. They may be manufactured of any colour, and laid on by ordinary labourers. The price of some of them is so low as twopence, and the highest does not exceed threepence per pound, in a flat fit for use. The author adds, that white lead ground with prepared fish oil, and thinned with linseed oil, surpasses any white hitherto employed for resisting all weathers, and retaining its whiteness. The following is an account of his processes.\n\n\"To refine one Ton of Cod, Whale, or Seal Oil, for painting, with the coif attending it.\n\nOne ton of fish oil, or 252 gallons, L.36 0 0\n32 gallons of vinegar, at 2s. per gallon, 3 4 0\n12 lbs. litharge, at 5d. per lb. 5 0 0\n12 lbs. white copperas, at 6d. ditto, 6 0 0\n12 gallons of linseed oil, at 4s. 6d. per gallon, 2 14 0\n2 gallons of spirits of turpentine, at 8s. ditto, 16 0\n\nL.43 5 0\n\n252 gallons of fish oil,\n12 ditto linseed oil,\n2 ditto spirits of turpentine,\n32 ditto vinegar.\n\n298 gallons, worth 4s. 6d. per gallon.\n\nWhich produces L.67 1 0\nDeduct the expence 43 5 0\n\nL.23 16 0 profit.\n\n\"To prepare the Vinegar for the Oil.\n\nInto a cask which will contain about forty gallons, put 32 gallons of good common vinegar; add to this 12 pounds of litharge, and 12 pounds of white copperas in powder; bung up the vessel, and shake and roll it well twice a day for a week; when it will be fit to put into a ton of whale, cod, or seal oil; (but the Southern whale oil is to be preferred, on account of its good colour, and little or no smell); flake and mix all together, when it may fettle until the next day; then pour off the clear, which will be about seven eighths of the whole. To this clear part add twelve gallons of linseed oil, and two gallons of spirit of turpentine; flake them well together, and after the whole has fettled two or three days, it will be fit to grind white lead, and all fine colours in; and, when ground, cannot be distinguished from those ground in linseed oil, unless by the superiority of its colour.\n\n\"If the oil is wanted only for coarse purposes, the linseed oil and oil of turpentine may be added at the same time that the prepared vinegar is put in, and after being well thicken up, is fit for immediate use without being suffered to settle.\n\n\"The vinegar is to dissolve the litharge; and the copperas accelerates the dissolution, and strengthens the drying quality.\n\n\"The residue, or bottom, when fettled, by the addition of half its quantity of fresh lime-water, forms an excellent oil for mixing with all the coarse paints for preserving outside work.\n\n\"Note. All colours ground in the above oil, and used for inside work, must be thinned with linseed oil and oil of turpentine.\n\n\"The oil mixed with lime-water, I call incorporated oil.\n\n\"The method of preparing, and the expense of the various Impenetrable Paints.\n\nFirst—Subdued Green.\n\nFresh lime water, 6 gallons, L.0 0 3\nRoad dirt finely sifted, 112 pounds, 1 0 0\nWhiting, 112 ditto, 2 4 0\nBlue-black, 30 ditto, 2 6 0\nWet blue, 20 ditto, 10 0 0\nRefuse of the oil, 3 gallons, 6 0 0\nYellow ochre in powder, 24 pounds, 2 0 0\n\nL.1 4 1\n\n\"This composition will weigh 368 pounds, which is scarcely one penny per pound.

This paint, the author observes, is not entirely free from smell in the operation, but becomes dry in four hours, at the end of which time the smell is entirely dissipated.\n\n\"White Paint.\n\n\"To one gallon of spirits of turpentine, add two pounds of frankincense; let it simmer over a clear fire until dissolved; strain it and bottle it for use. To one gallon...\"\nPAIR; two of a sort, a couple.\n\nPAIRING, the uniting or joining in couples.\n\nThe instinct of pairing is bestowed on every species of animals to which it is necessary for rearing their young; and on no other species. All wild birds pair; but with a remarkable difference between such as place their nests on trees and such as place them on the ground. The young of the former, being hatched blind, and without feathers, require the nursing care of both parents till they are able to fly. The male feeds his mate on the nest, and cheers her with a song. As soon as the young are hatched, feeding yields to a more necessary occupation, that of providing food for a numerous issue; a task that requires both parents.\n\nEagles and other birds of prey build on trees, or on other inaccessible spots. They not only pair, but continue in pairs all the year round; and the same pair procreates year after year. This at least is the case of eagles: the male and female hunt together, unless during incubation, at which time the female is fed by the male. A greater number than a single pair are never seen in company.\n\n* Gregarious birds pair, in order probably to prevent discord in a society confined to a narrow space. This is the case particularly of pigeons and rooks. The male and female sit on the eggs alternately, and divide the care of feeding their young.\n\nPartridges, plovers, pheasants, sea fowl, grouse, and other kinds that place their nests on the ground, have the instinct of pairing; but differ from such as build on trees in the following particular, that after the female is impregnated, she completes her task without needing any help from the male. Retiring from him, she chooses a safe spot for her nest, where she can find plenty of worms and grass feed at hand; and her young, as soon as hatched, take foot, and seek food for themselves. The only remaining duty incumbent on the dam is, to lead them to proper places for food, and to call them together when danger impedes. Some males, provoked at the defection of their mates, break the eggs if they stumble on them. Eider ducks pair like other birds that place their nests on the ground; and the female furnishes her nest with down plucked from her own breast. If the nest be destroyed for the down, which is remarkably warm and elastic, she makes another nest as before. If she is robbed a second time, she makes a third nest; but the male furnishes the down. A lady of spirit observed, that the elder duck may give a lesson to many a married woman, who is more disposed to pluck her husband than herself. The black game never pairs in spring, the cock on an eminence crows, and claps his wings; and all the females within hearing instantly resort to him.\n\nPairing birds, excepting those of prey, flock together in February, in order to choose their mates. They soon disperse; and are not seen afterward but in pairs.\n\nPairing is unknown to quadrupeds that feed on grass. To such it would be useless; as the female gives suck to her young while she herself is feeding. If M. Buffon deserves credit, the roe deer are an exception. They pair, though they feed on grass, and have but one litter in a year.\n\nBeasts of prey, such as lions, tigers, wolves, pair not. The female is left to shift for herself and for her young; which is a laborious task, and often so unsuccessful as to shorten the life of many of them. Pairing is essential to birds of prey, because incubation leaves the female no sufficient time to hunt for food. Pairing is not necessary to beasts of prey, because their young can bear a long fast. Add another reason, that they would multiply too fast by pairing, as to prove troublesome neighbours to the human race.\n\nAmong animals that pair not, males fight desperately about a female. Such a battle among horned cattle, is finely described by Lucretius. Nor is it unusual for seven or eight lions to wage bloody war for a single female.\n\nThe same reason that makes pairing necessary for gregarious birds, obtains with respect to gregarious quadrupeds; those especially who store up food for winter, and during that season live in common. Discord among such would be attended with worse consequences than even among lions and bulls, who are not confined to one place. The beavers, with respect to pairing, resemble birds that place their nests on the ground. As soon as the young are produced, the males abandon their stock of food to their mates, and live at large; but return frequently to visit them while they are suckling their young.\n\nHedgehogs pair, as well as several of the monkey kind. We are not well acquainted with the natural history of these animals; but it would appear that the young require the nursing care of both parents.\n\nSeals have a singular economy. Polygamy seems to be a law of nature among them, as a male associates with several females. The sea turtle has no occasion to pair, as the female concludes her task by laying her eggs in the land. The young are hatched by the sun, and immediately crawl to the sea.\n\nPAISLEY, a town of Renfrewshire, in Scotland, situated about six miles and a half west of Glasgow, on the river White Cart, over which there are two stone bridges of two arches each, and one which consists of three arches. The town is very ancient; but was of much less consequence formerly than it is at present. No satisfactory etymology has hitherto occurred of the name Paisley. The following has been suggested by a good Gaelic scholar: 'A ridge of rocks that runs across the river, and forms a beautiful cascade, would, prior to the building...\nbuilding of the town, be undoubtedly the most striking object that this place would present. The brow or face of a rock is in Gaelic Pais-lacht. A church in front of the rock would be the church in Pais-lacht. A church did stand here previous to 1160; it is named in the foundation charter Ecclesia de Paselet, Latinized, in the records of the monastery, Paislattum, an easy derivative from Pais-lacht in all probability the original of the modern Paisley. It was erected into a burgh of barony by James IV., in the year 1488, at that time probably deriving all its importance from the rich monastery which had been established there for several ages; for George Schaw, who was then abbot of that monastery, obtained this privilege from the king. Even in Mr. Crawford's time, who wrote the history of the thirteenth century, it seems to have been but an inconsiderable place; for he describes it as consisting only of one principal street, about half a mile in length, with several lanes belonging to it; whereas now the town, with its suburbs, occupies such an extent of ground, that strangers are apt to consider it as, next to Edinburgh and Glasgow, the largest and most populous town in Scotland. Its buildings of late years have been greatly improved; its streets are well paved; and the different parts of the town and suburbs, where the river intervenes, are connected with one another by three bridges at convenient distances.\n\nThe affairs of the community are managed by three bailies, of which the eldest is commonly in the commission of the peace, a treasurer, a town clerk, and 17 counsellors, who are annually elected upon the first Monday after Michaelmas. It enjoys all the powers necessary for government and police, without any of the burdens to which royal boroughs are subjected. The freedom of the place is conferred on very moderate terms. The revenues of the town are not great, but they have been managed to the best advantage. The rapid increase of the place has not been attended with a proportional increase of revenue; therefore several necessary improvements, and intended public buildings, are not yet carried into execution. It gives the title of baron to the earls of Abercorn; the first of whom was a younger son of the Duke de Chateherault. The black book of Paisley, frequently mentioned in Scottish history, was a chronicle of the public affairs and remarkable events, kept by the monks who resided in the monastery. It agreed in every material fact with the Scoti-chronicon of Fordun; and is by many thought to be the same performance.\n\nThe old part of the town runs from east to west upon the south slope of a ridge of hills, from which there is a fine prospect of the city of Glasgow and the adjacent country; but to the southward, the view terminates in a ridge of green hills, about two miles distant. Including the late buildings and suburbs, it is fully a mile long, and nearly as much in breadth. On the east side of the river Cart, stand the abbey and new town. This new town was some years ago founded by the earl of Abercorn, and now consists of a number of handsome buildings. The streets are laid off in a regular manner, but (rather unfortunately for the convenience and elegance of some of the houses) not in right angles. Here the earl of Abercorn has built at his own expense one of the largest, most commodious, and most elegant inns in Scotland. In the vicinity of it was proposed also to build several convenient and necessary market places. A little way south of the inn stands the abbey church, the only one which Paisley formerly required. This church, when entire, has been a most noble building, and consisted of several distinct and separate places of worship: what now remains of this magnificent Gothic structure is not yet unworthy the notice of the curious in antiquities. Mr Pennant says, the great north window is a noble ruin, the arch very lofty, the middle pillar wonderfully light, and still entire: only the chancel now remains, which is divided into a middle and two side aisles, by very lofty pillars, with Gothic arches; above these is another range of pillars much larger, being the segment of a circle, and above a row of arched niches from end to end, over which the roof ends in a sharp point. The outside of the building is decorated with a profusion of ornaments, especially the great west and north doors, than which scarce anything lighter or richer can be imagined.\n\nThe town of Paisley continued a part of the original or Abbey parish of Paisley till the year 1738; when the magistrates and council having purchased the right of patronage from the then earl of Dundonald, a new church was built, and the town was erected into a separate parish. This is called the Loigh Church, is built in the form of a Greek cross, very well laid out, and capable of containing a great number of people. In 1756 another church was built, upon a very extended plan, to accommodate its multiplied inhabitants; in which, though it is one of the largest in Scotland, yet the most distant of the congregation can hear a tolerably good speaker with ease and distinctness; and as it stands upon the highest part of the town, it was afterwards ornamented with a lofty and well-proportioned spire, visible at a great distance. This is called the High Church, and is a very fine building: it is an oblong square of 82 feet by 62 within the walls, built of free stone well smoothed, having rustic corners and an elegant stone cornice at the top. In the construction of the roof (which is a pavilion covered with slate, having a platform covered with lead on the top), there is something very curious, and it is admired by every person of taste. In 1781, the number of the inhabitants still rapidly increasing, another church, called the Middle Church, was built, not quite so large as the former, but very handsome and elegantly finished: and in the following year, the town was divided and erected into three separate parishes, exclusive of the Abbey parish, and named according to their respective churches.\n\nThere are two large dissenting congregations in the town; those of the Antiburgher persuasion and the Relief. The first of these has existed there for upwards of 30 years; the other is of a late date. There is besides a small congregation of Cameronians.\n\nThe townhouse is a very handsome building of cut stone, with a tall spire and a clock. The flesh market has a genteel front of cut stone, and is one of the neatest and most commodious of the kind in Britain. Butchers meat, butter, cheese, fish, wool, and several other articles, are sold here by what they call the iron pound, of 22 English ounces and a half.\n\nThe poor house is a large building, very well laid out; and stands opposite to the quay, in a fine free air. It is supported by a small tax laid upon the inhabitants quarterly.\n\nClose by the Abbey church is the earl of Abercorn's burial place.\nPaisley, burial place, the greatest curiosity in Paisley. It is a vaulted Gothic chapel, without pulpit, pew, or any other ornament, but has the finest echo perhaps in the world. When the end door (the only one it has) is shut, the noise is equal to a loud and not very distant clap of thunder. If you strike a single note of music, you have the sound gradually ascending, with a great number of repetitions, till it dies away as if at an immense distance, and all the while diffusing itself through the circumambient air. If a good voice sings, or a musical instrument is well played upon, the effect is inexpressibly agreeable. The deepest, as well as the most acute tones, are distinctly reverberated, and these in regular intervals of time. When a musical instrument is sounded, it has the effect of a number of instruments of a like size and kind playing in concert. When a number of different instruments in unison found the same note, a good ear is able to distinguish the variety of sound produced by each. A single instrument founding a particular note, and then instantly its fifth, or any other concordant note, the two sounds can be heard, as it were, running into and uniting with each other in a manner peculiarly agreeable. But the effect of a variety of instruments playing in concert is particularly charming, and must excite such emotions in the soul as it is impossible to describe. In this chapel is the monument of Marjory Bruce (A); she was the daughter of Robert Bruce, and wife of Walter, great steward of Scotland, and mother of Robert II. In this same chapel were interred Elizabeth Muir and Euphemia Ross, both consorts to Robert II.\n\nA particular account of the abbey of Paisley would fill many pages. It was founded as a priory for monks of the order of Clugni about the year 1160 by Walter, great steward of Scotland. It was afterwards raised to the rank of an abbacy; and the lands belonging to it were by Robert II. erected into a regality, under the jurisdiction of the abbot. After the Reformation, the abbey was secularized by the pope in favour of Lord Claud Hamilton, third son of the duke of Chatelherault, in reward of his steady adherence to the cause of Queen Mary; and, in 1588, it was by the king and parliament erected into a temporal lordship, and Lord Claud was created Lord Paisley. The revenues of the abbey were very considerable. They consisted of the tythes of 28 different parishes, with the property of the lordships of Paisley, of Kilpatrick in Dumbartonshire, and of Monkton in Ayrshire, extending each to a hundred merkland; and the forty pound land of Glen in Lochwinnoch; with the lands of Achengown, Grange, &c., and a considerable detached property in different parts of the kingdom. All this property, with the patronage of the several churches, fell to Lord Claud Hamilton, last abbot of Paisley. It continued in that family till 1563, when his grandson James earl of Abercorn sold the lordship of Paisley to the earl of Angus, who next year sold it to William Lord Cochran, Kilpatrick to Sir John Hamilton of Orbittoun, Monkton to Lord Bargenny, and Glen to Lord Semple and others. Great part of the lordship of Paisley was at different times sold off by the family of Dundonald; and what remained of it was in 1764 repurchased by the late earl of Abercorn. The fabric of the abbey owed much of its magnificence to Abbot George Schaw, who about 1484 enlarged and beautified the building, surrounding the church, the precincts of the convent, the gardens, and a small deer park, with a noble wall of hewn freestone. The abbey was, after the Reformation, successively the seat of the earls of Abercorn and Dundonald. The late earl of Dundonald demolished the ancient gateway; and, by fencing off the immediately adjoining grounds for building, entirely changed the appearance of the place. As it was thus rendered totally unfit for a family residence, it has since that time been let out into separate dwellings, and is now in a very mean and almost ruinous state. The wall stood almost entire till 1781, when the garden being fenced off for building upon by the late earl of Abercorn, the wall was sold to the feuars, and the stones of it employed in their houses.\n\nThe vestiges of the Roman camp and praetorium, at the west end of the town, are at present almost annihilated. It was supposed to be vaulted underneath.\n\nThe number of inhabitants in the town of Paisley amounted in 1695 to 2200; in 1755 they were 4290; in 1782, 11,100; and in 1792 they were 13,800. At present the number of inhabitants in the town and suburbs certainly exceeds 25,000.\n\nPaisley is now the first manufacturing town in Scotland, and is greatly celebrated on account of some of its branches. The manufactory of silk gauze, in this respect, first claims our notice. This branch is brought here to the utmost perfection, and is wrought to an amazing variety of patterns. It has been computed, that there have been no less than 5000 weavers employed in Paisley and in the country adjacent; and the number of winders, warpers, clippers, and others necessary in other parts of the silk manufacture, has been likewise computed to be no less than 5000. Each loom will produce in an average value 70l. yearly; the whole will then be 350,000l.\n\nIt appears, from the best calculation that could be made, that in the year 1784 the manufactures of Paisley in silk gauze, lawn and linen gauze, and white sewing thread (B), amounted to the value of 579,185l. 16s. 6d. and that no fewer than 26,484 persons were employed in carrying them on. It is difficult to give an exact account of the state of its manufactures at present. The silk branch has evidently declined, but the muslin has so far\n\n---\n\n(A) Her story is singular: In the year 1317, when she was big with child, she broke her neck in hunting near this place: the Caesarean operation was instantly performed, and the child taken out alive; but the operator changing to hurt one eye with his instrument, occasioned the blemish that gave him afterwards the epithet of Blear-eye; and the monument is also styled that of Queen Bleary. Elizabeth Muir died before the accession of her husband Robert.\n\n(B) This was introduced into this town about 60 or 70 years ago. The method of making what is called glazed white thread, has been discovered and brought to as great perfection as that made by Mr Leland and Son, London. The value of this branch is computed at about 60,000l. annually.\nP A I\n\nPaisley far come in its room, and the thread manufacture has considerably increased. There is, however, reason to conclude, that, though it is daily advancing, it has not yet recovered its former greatness. Besides these principal manufactures, there are some others carried on there of too much importance to be overlooked: for instance, considerable tan works, four in number, two soap and candle works, a manufacture of ribbons, and another of inkle or tape. In 1789 the annual value of all the manufactures in Paisley of every sort amounted to £663,385l. 16s.\n\nIn the various weaving branches there were employed at Whitfield 1791, in the suburbs of Paisley, 1108 looms, which, added to 2494 employed in the town, gives 3602 in all. But it is to be observed, that the extent to which the weaving branches are carried on by the manufacturers in Paisley, is not to be judged of from the number of looms in the town and suburbs. Besides about 150 in the country part of the parish, there are great numbers employed by them in the villages of Neilston, Barhead, Beith, Dalry, Kilwinning, &c. &c. In 1744, when all the burghs was confined to the town and suburbs, there were 867 looms at work.\n\nThe thread-making in Abbey parish employs 9 mills, which, added to 128 employed in Paisley, makes 137 in all. The number in 1744 was 93. The spinning of cotton was introduced into Abbey parish in 1783. The principal seat of that manufacture is at Johnstone, a neat and regularly built village about three miles west from Paisley, upon the estate of Mr Houston of Johnstone. The fencing of that village was begun in 1782; and it contained, at Whitfield 1792, 293 families, or 1434 souls. There are five companies established in it for cotton spinning. Two of these carry on their principal operations by water machinery. In the two mills employed in them, there are going at present 11,672 spindles; but, when the whole machinery in both shall be completed, there will be 22,572. The number of persons, young and old, at present employed in both mills is 660. There is also in the neighbourhood of Paisley a calico printing work. Copperas has been long manufactured at Lord Glasgow's coal works; and for several years past the manufacture of alum has been conducted on a very extensive scale at the same place.\n\nThe bleaching burghs in the Abbey parish is carried on to a very considerable extent. There are 10 fields for whitening muslins and lawns, and about as many for thread, almost wholly employed by the manufacturers in Paisley. About 300 persons are at work in this branch of burghs, of whom about 240 are women, who are hired for the season. A soap and candle manufacture pays about 2000l. of duty per annum to government, and has in some years paid upwards of 3000l. A black and hard soap manufacture, 4500l. per annum. The starch manufacture is but lately established. The distillery burghs is to be mentioned under this head: it has for some time past been carried on to a great extent, and the spirit manufactured in great perfection. A considerable quantity of it is exported, but too much of it is consumed at home (c).\n\nThe river on which Paisley stands runs from south to north; and falls into the Clyde, after it has joined the confluence of the rivers Griffe and Black Cart at Inchinnan bridge, about three miles below the town. At spring tides, vessels of 40 tons burden come up to the quay. The communication by water is of great importance to the inhabitants: for in this way they are frequently supplied with fish of different kinds, and can send their goods and manufactures to Port Glasgow and Greenock, and to Glasgow likewise; and now, by means of the great canal, they have also a communication with the frith of Forth.\n\nThe air here is moist; a necessary consequence of the prevailing south-west winds, which, coming loaded with vapour from the Atlantic, produce frequent and heavy rains. The effects of this moist atmosphere appear in rheumatism, quinsies, pneumatic ailments, and all the tribe of inflammatory disorders. Upon the whole, however, neither the town nor country adjacent can be said to be unhealthy. Contagious, indeed, at times visit this as other places, which run their usual course as epidemics; but none are remembered of any uncommon violence except a pleurisy in summer 1771, and which, contrary to the received opinion, was truly epidemic. There are no disorders that can be said to be endemic, unless scrofula is to be excepted, which is still but too common. This has been ascribed to the water used by the inhabitants of Paisley: it more probably proceeded from, and certainly was greatly aggravated by, poor living, and by the damp flaps which were necessary for the linen manufacture; for since silk weaving became the general employment, and increase of trade has introduced better living, this disorder is less frequent. From the same cause probably it is that swelled and sore legs, once extremely common here, are now but rarely met with. Dysentery raged with great violence in 1765; since that time it has been scarcely complained of. Nervous fevers at times appear; but they are neither very general nor uncommonly fatal. It is to be apprehended, that the confinement and sedentary posture of the weaver, and the laborious life of the bleacher, are frequent causes of consumptive complaints. Intermittents, which, from the damp air, and adjoining mists, might be expected to be common, are not so much as known. W. Long. 4° 20'. N.

The town consists of about 250 houses but one story high; and the walls are made of split cane and mud, and the roofs only a covering of leaves. The only defence of Paita is a fort without either ditch or outwork; but it is surrounded by a brick wall of little or no strength, on which are mounted eight pieces of cannon. It was frequently plundered by the bucaniers; and Commodore Anson got possession of its fort in 1741, and took and burnt the town because the governor refused to ransom it. W. Long. 81° 19'. S.

Hu-pi-hay, of the Mogul empire, in the year 1263, built one for his ancestors; and he is the first who borrowed this Chinese custom. Amongst the works of the ancient Egyptians, we have an account, in the Ancient Universal History, of a most magnificent palace in the Upper Egypt, not far from Aswan, the ancient Syene; the ruins whereof are enough to strike a spectator with astonishment. It is as large as a little city, having four avenues of columns, leading to as many porticoes. At each gate, between two pillars of porphyry, stand two gigantic figures of fine black marble, armed with maces. The avenues consist of columns set three and three together, in a triangle, on one pedestal; on the chapter of each triangle is placed a sphinx and a tomb alternately. Every column is 75 feet high, all of one stone. There are in all the four avenues about 5000 or 6000 of these columns, a great many of which are fallen down.\n\nThe first hall of this palace is adorned with pieces of history, which seem as fresh as if the painting had not been long finished. In some places they have represented the hunting of antelopes; in others, feasts, and a great many young children playing with all kinds of animals. From thence you go into other apartments, incrustled with marble, the roof being supported with pillars of porphyry and black marble. Notwithstanding the vast quantity of rubbish, our author made shift to get up to the top of this building, from whence he had a prospect of the ruins of the greatest city that ever had been, as he thought, in the world. He supposes it might be the ancient Thebes; but that city stood much lower.\n\nPALACE-Court. See MARSHALSEA.\n\nPALÆMON, or MELICERTA. See MELICERTA.\n\nPALÆMON, Ῥημμίντης, a famous grammarian of Rome, in the reign of Tiberius. He was born of a slave at Vienza. We are told he was first brought up in the business of a weaver; but attending his master's son to school, he used this opportunity to procure knowledge; and acquired so much skill in the common learning, that he obtained his freedom, and became a teacher or preceptor at Rome. His claim to learning cannot be questioned, since he is recorded as a scholar even by Juvenal:\n\n*Quis gremio Enceladi doctique Palæmonis affert,\nQuantum grammaticus meruit labor?*\nSat. vii.\n\nHe had also an excellent memory, a ready elocution, and could make verses extempore. On account of these qualities, notwithstanding his debauched course of life, which was such that nobody was more unworthy to have the preceptorship of youth, he held the first rank among those of his profession. But his arrogance surpassed his merit: he had the confidence to assert, that learning was born when he was born, and would die when he died; and that Virgil had inherited his name in his Elegies by a certain prophetic spirit: for that he, Palæmon, would infallibly become one day sole judge and arbiter of all poetry. He was excessively prodigal for Palæologus the gratification of his voluptuous humour; inasmuch that neither the immense sums he gained by teaching, nor the great profit he made, both by cultivating his lands and in the way of traffic, proved a sufficient fund to support his extravagancies. We have only some fragments of his works.\n\nPALÆOLOGUS, MICHAEL, a very able man who was governor of Asia under the emperor Theodorus Laiçaros; and who, by various stratagems and cruelties, procured the empire for himself and his posterity. See CONSTANTINOPLE, from No. 145. to the end of that article.\n\nPALÆPAPHOS (Strabo, Virgil, Pliny), a town of Cyprus, where stood a temple of Venus; and an adjoining town called Neo Paphos; where St Paul struck Elymas blind, and converted the proconsul Sergius Paulus.\n\nPALÆSTRA, in Grecian antiquity, a public building where the youth exercised themselves in wrestling, running, playing at quoits, &c. To prevent the combatants from hurting themselves by falling, the bottom of the palaestra was covered with dust or gravel. Some will have the palaestra to be only a part of the gymnasticum. Many authors imagine that the palaestra was of two kinds; the one for the exercise of the body, the other for the cultivation of the mind; but the derivation of the word seems to confine it to bodily exercise.\n\nWe have this account of the palaestra in Bartholomew's Anacharsis: \"They are nearly of the same form with Vol. ii. the gymnasticum. We visited the apartments appropriated to all the species of baths; thole where the wrestlers leave their clothes, where they rub their bodies with oil to render their limbs supple, and where they roll themselves in the sand in order to give their antagonists a hold.\n\n\"Wrestling, leaping, tennis, and all the exercises of the lyceum, were here repeated before us with greater varieties, and with more strength and skill on the part of the performers. Among the different groups before us, we distinguished men of the most perfect beauty, and worthy of serving as models for artists: some with vigorous and boldly marked outlines, as Hercules is represented; and others of a more slim and elegant shape, as Achilles is described. The former, devoting themselves to wrestling and boxing, had no object but to increase their bodily strength; the latter, educated to less violent exercises, such as running, leaping, &c., confined themselves to acquirement of agility.\n\n\"Their regimen is suited to the different exercises for which they are designed. Some of them abstain from women and wine; others lead a very abstemious life; but those who make laborious exertions stand in need of a great quantity of substantial food, such as roasted beef and pork, to restore their strength. If they require only two minae a-day, with bread in proportion, they give a very favourable idea of their temperance. But several are mentioned who have made a terrible consumption of provisions. Thaegenes of Thasos, for instance, is said to have eaten a whole ox in a day. The same exploit is attributed to Milo of Crotona, whose usual quantity of food for a day was twenty minae of meat, as many of bread, and three congi of wine. It is said likewise, that Astydamas of Miletus, when at the table of Ariobarzanes...\nPalamedes the Persian fatrap, devoured alone the supper prepared for nine guests. These stories, no doubt exaggerated, prove at least the idea generally entertained of the voracity of this class of wrestlers. When they are able to gratify it without danger, they acquire extraordinary strength: their stature becomes sometimes gigantic; and their adversaries, struck with terror, either decline entering the lists, or sink under the weight of their enormous bodies.\n\n\"They are so oppressed by excess of nutriment as to be obliged to pass part of their lives in a profound sleep, and soon become extremely corpulent as to be no longer known to be the same persons: this is succeeded by disorders which render them as wretched as they have always been unfavourable to their country; for it cannot be denied that wrestling, boxing, and all those combats disputed with so much fury and obstinacy in the public solemnities, are no longer anything but ostentatious exhibitions, since tactics have been brought to perfection. Egypt at no time adopted them, as they give only a temporary strength. Lacedemon has corrected their inconveniences by the wisdom of her institutions. In the other states of Greece men have discovered, that, by subjecting their children to them, they incur the risk of injuring their shape and preventing their growth; and that, in a more advanced age, professed wrestlers never make good soldiers, because they are unable to support hunger, thirst, watching, the smallest wants, or the most trifling deviation from their usual habits.\" See Pentathlum and Pancratium.\n\nPALASTROPHYLAX, was the director of the palaestra, and the exercises performed there.\n\nPALAMBOANG, or PALAMBANG, a town of Asia, in the East Indies, and in the island of Java, capital of a kingdom; situated at the east end of the island, on the straits of Bally, and separated from the island of Bally by a narrow channel. E. Long. 115° 10'. S. Lat. 7° 10'.\n\nPALAMEDEA, a genus of birds belonging to the order of grallae. See Ornithology Index.\n\nPALAMEDES, a Greek chief, son of Nauplius king of Euboea, by Clemene. He was sent by the Greek princes who were going to the Trojan war, in order to bring Ulysses to the camp, who, to avoid the expedition, pretended insanity; and the better to carry on the imposition, he often harnessed different animals to a plough, and sowed salt instead of barley. Palamedes soon discovered the cheat. He knew that regret to part with Penelope, whom Ulysses had lately married, was his only reason for pretending insanity; and to demonstrate this, Palamedes took Telemachus, of whom Penelope had lately been delivered, and put him before his father's plough. Ulysses turned the plough a different way, not to hurt his child. He was therefore obliged to attend the Greek princes to the war; but a mortal enmity took place between Ulysses and Palamedes. The king of Ithaca determined to take every opportunity to distress him; and when all his expectations were frustrated, he was mean enough to bribe one of his servants, and to make him dig a hole in his master's tent, and there conceal a large sum of money. After this Ulysses forged a letter in Phrygian characters, as from Priam to Palamedes. In the letter the Trojan king seemed to beg Palamedes to deliver into his hands the Grecian army, according to the conditions which had been previously agreed upon when he received the money. This forged letter was carried, by means of Ulysses, before the princes of the Grecian army. Palamedes was summoned, and made the most solemn protestations of innocence, but in vain. The money that was discovered in his tent served to corroborate the accusation; and he was therefore found guilty by the whole army, and stoned to death. Homer is silent about the unfortunate fate of Palamedes; and Pausanias mentions, that it had been reported by some that Ulysses and Diomedes had drowned him in the sea as he was fishing on the coast. Philostratus, who mentions the tragical story as above related, adds, that Achilles and Ajax buried his body with great pomp on the sea shore; and that they raised upon it a funeral chapel, where sacrifices were regularly offered by the inhabitants of Troas. Palamedes was a man of learning as well as a soldier; and, according to some, he completed the alphabet of Cadmus by the addition of the four letters θ, ψ, χ, φ, during the Trojan war. To him also is attributed the invention of dice and backgammon; and it is said that he was the first who regularly ranged an army in a line of battle, and who placed sentinels round the camp, and excited their vigilance and attention by giving them a watchword.\n\nPALARIA, among the Romans, a kind of exercise performed at a stake by the soldiers. The stake being fixed in the ground, and six feet high above it, the young undisciplined soldiers advanced against it, armed with a hurdle and cudgel, instead of a sword and shield, and went through all the rules of attack and defence, as if actually engaged with an adversary. Sometimes they stood at a distance, and attacked with missile weapons; at the same time using all the requisite motions for defending themselves, and warding off what might be thrown against them.\n\nPALATE, in Anatomy, the flesh that composes the roof, or the upper and inner part, of the mouth.\n\nThe palate has much the same structure with the gums; but it has also a great number of glands, discovered so early as the time of Fallopius: these are principally situated in the hinder part near the uvula, where it is pendulous, in the manner of a curtain, which part is called the velum, or claytrum, of the palate. The glands situated particularly in this part, secrete a mucous fluid, serving to lubricate the mouth and throat, and to facilitate deglutition: they have a great number of apertures there for the discharge of this humour into the mouth.\n\nThe uses of this membrane are, to defend the bones of the palate from corrupting; and for preventing, by its claustrum or velum, the things to be swallowed from getting up into the nostrils.\n\nPALATINATE, a province or signiory, possessed by a palatine.\n\nPALATINATE of the Rhine, a province of Germany, divided into two parts by the Rhine, called the Upper and Lower Palatinates. The former lies in the circle of Bavaria, and belongs to the elector thereof; but the latter, in the circle we are now treating, belongs to the elector palatine. The latter part is bounded to the east by the county of Katzenelnbogen, the archbishopric of Mentz, the bishopric of Worms, and part of the territory of the Teutonic order in Franconia; to the west by Alsace, the duchy of Deuxponts, the county of Sponheim,\nPalatinate. To the chamber of Wetzlar he contributes, each term, 404 rixdollars, 82 krutitzers. There is an order of knighthood in this country, viz. that of St Hubert; the badge of which is a quadrangular cross pendant to a red ribbon, with a star on the breast. The whole of the elector's revenue, arising from the Palatinate, the duchies of Berg and Juliers, the seigniory of Ravenstein, and the duchies of Neuburg and Sulzbach, hath been estimated at about 300,000l. per annum. The military establishment consists of several regiments of horse and foot, besides the horse and Swiss life-guards: in time of peace he is said to maintain about 6000 men.—All the different courts and councils, usual in other countries for the different departments of government, are also to be found here.\n\nIn general, the Lower Palatinate has suffered more by the preceding wars with France than all the provinces of Germany put together during the space of 30 years; for the French have plundered the country, and demolished some of its first towns more than once. It has undergone various changes during the late French revolution, for an account of which, see FRANCE. In the modern part of the Universal History, we have the following account of the rise of the Palatinate of the Rhine, under the history of Germany.\n\n\"Though Conrad the son of Everhard inherited from his father the duchy of Franconia, with the counties of Hesse and Alsace, he could not succeed him in the dignity of Count Palatine, because Otho had taken it from his father, and conferred it on Herman third son of Arnold duke of Bavaria: but as this honour was unattended with any fold advantage, the emperor began to annex to it the lands and cattles situated on the Rhine, whence he acquired the title of Count Palatine of the Rhine: and, in procels of time, these counts made great acquisitions by marriages, purchases, mortgages, and imperial donations, so as to form a very considerable province.\" The powers of counts palatine in the German empire have always been ample; we have this account of it in the same learned work.\n\n\"When the counts palatine of the Rhine began to execute their office, they neither possessed on that river lands, cities, nor castles; but having by degrees made great acquisitions by marriages, purchases, agreements, imperial donations, or otherwise, they have at length formed a very considerable principality. We are told, that under the emperors of the house of Swabia, their authority and power increased greatly, though it was a gradual increase. Under the reign of the emperor Henry IV. the credit of the counts palatine was very considerable at the court; and by the German law, the count palatine of the Rhine enjoys not only during the absence of the emperor, but likewise during a vacancy of the empire, the right of the ban beyond the Rhine, to within a mile of the city of Metz, and as far as the ocean, as well as in Flanders. However, this right of the ban has not been granted to him by the emperors. There is likewise an ancient ordinance, in which the office of count palatine is mentioned; it imports, that the count palatine is always by right the representative or lieutenant of the kingdom. Lastly, How great the power of the counts palatine was, may be understood from this, that in the election of Rodolphus of Hapsburgh, and in that of Henry VII. the other electors promised...\"\nPalatinates promised to acknowledge as emperor him whom he should name. Although, however, the power of the counts palatine had as it were secured to them the vicariate of the empire, nevertheless the emperors still referred to themselves the right of establishing vicars.\" See Bavaria.\n\nPALATINATES OF POLAND. Previous to the revolution in this unfortunate country, it was divided into palatinates; whether those will be now changed cannot at present be ascertained, though it seems likely. A Polish palatine is thus described in the Universal History:\n\n\"A palatine may be regarded as the governor of a province, who levies and leads the troops of his own jurisdiction to join the army of the republic. His civil power is likewise considerable, as he presides at the assemblies of his palatinate, rates the prices of all commodities and merchandise in the province, regulates the weights and measures, and judges and defends the Jews within his jurisdiction. This part of his function is particularly specified, that a set of men the most useful and industrious in Poland may not be oppressed; the king being likewise obliged, by his oath, to afford them the protection of the laws and his sovereignty. Under him is appointed a substitute or vice-palatine, who takes an oath to his superior, and must be possessed of a land estate to a certain value.\"\n\nPALATINE, or COUNT PALATINE, a title anciently given to all persons who had any office or employment in the prince's palace: but afterwards conferred on those delegated by princes to hold courts of justice in the provinces; and on such among the lords as had a palace, that is, a court of justice, in their own houses.\n\nCounties Palatine in England.—Chester, Durham, and Lancaster, are called counties palatine. The two former are such by prescription, or immemorial custom; or, at least as old as the Norman conquest; the latter was created by King Edward III. in favour of Henry Plantagenet, first earl and then duke of Lancaster; whose heirs being married to John of Gaunt the king's son, the franchise was greatly enlarged and confirmed in parliament, to honour John of Gaunt himself, whom, on the death of his father-in-law, the king had also created duke of Lancaster. Counties palatine are also called à palatium because the owners thereof, the earl of Chester, the bishop of Durham, and the duke of Lancaster, had in those counties jura regalia, as fully as the king hath in his palace; regalem postulatum in omnibus, as Bracton expresses it. They might pardon treasons, murders, and felonies; they appointed all judges and justices of the peace; all writs and indictments ran in their names, as in other counties in the king's; and all offences were said to be done against their peace, and not, as in other places, contra pacem domini regis. And indeed by the ancient law, in all peculiar jurisdictions, offences were said to be done against his peace in whose court they were tried; in a court-leet, contra pacem domini; in the court of a corporation, contra pacem ballivorum; in the sheriff's court or tourn, contra pacem vicecomitis. These palatine privileges (so similar to the regal independent jurisdictions usurped by the great barons on the continent during the weak and infant state of the first feudal kingdoms in Europe) were in all probability originally granted to the counties of Chester and Durham, because they bordered upon enemies countries, Wales and Scotland; in order that the owners, being encouraged by so large an authority, might be the more watchful in its defence; and that the inhabitants, having justice administered at home, might not be obliged to go out of the county, and leave it open to the enemy's incursions. And upon this account also there were formerly two other counties palatine, Pembrokeshire and Hexamshire, the latter now united with Northumberland: but these were abolished by parliament, the former in 27 Henry VIII. the latter in 14 Eliz. And in 27 Hen. VIII. likewise, the powers before mentioned of owners of counties palatine were abridged; the reason for their continuance in a manner ceasing; though still all writs are witnessed in their names, and all forfeitures for treason by the common law accrue to them.\n\nOf these three, the county of Durham is now the only one remaining in the hands of a subject. For the earldom of Chester, as Camden testifies, was united to the crown by Henry III. and has ever since given title to the king's eldest son. And the county palatine or duchy of Lancaster was the property of Henry of Bolingbroke, the son of John of Gaunt, at the time when he wrested the crown from King Richard II. and assumed the title of Henry IV. But he was too prudent to suffer this to be united to the crown; lest, if he lost one, he should lose the other also. For, as Plowden and Sir Edward Coke observe, \"he knew he had the duchy of Lancaster by sure and indefeasible title, but that his title to the crown was not so assured: for that after the decease of Richard II. the right of the crown was in the heir of Lionel duke of Clarence, second son of Edward III.; John of Gaunt, father to this Henry IV., being but the fourth son.\" And therefore he procured an act of parliament, in the first year of his reign, ordaining that the duchy of Lancaster, and all other his hereditary estates, with all their royalties and franchises, should remain to him and his heirs for ever; and should remain, defend, be administered, and governed, in like manner as if he never had attained the regal dignity; and thus they descended to his son and grandson Henry V. and Henry VI.; many new territories and privileges being annexed to the duchy by the former. Henry VI. being attainted in 1 Edw. IV. this duchy was declared in parliament to have become forfeited to the crown, and at the same time an act was made to incorporate the duchy of Lancaster, to continue the county palatine (which might otherwise have determined by the attainder), and to make the same parcel of the duchy; and, farther to vest the whole in King Edward IV. and his heirs, kings of England, for ever; but under a separate guiding and governance from the other inheritances of the crown. And in 1 Hen. VII. another act was made, to resume such part of the duchy lands as had been dismembered from it in the reign of Edw. IV. and to vest the inheritance of the whole in the king and his heirs for ever, as amply and largely, and in like manner, form, and condition, separate from the crown of England and possession of the same, as the three Henges and Edward IV. or any of them, had and held the same.\n\nThe Isle of Ely is not a county palatine, though sometimes erroneously called so, but only a royal franchise: the bishop having, by grant of King Henry I. jura regalia within the Isle of Ely; whereby he exercises a jurisdiction over all causes, as well criminal as civil.\nPALATINE Games, in Roman antiquity, games instituted in honour of Augustus by his wife Livia, after he had been enrolled among the gods. They were celebrated in the palace, from whence the name, and were confirmed by the succeeding emperors.\n\nSome authors say that these games were instituted in honour of Julius Caesar, and others again confound them with the Ludi Augurales; but neither of these opinions seem to be well supported. See AUGUSTALES.\n\nPALATINUS MONS, or Palatium, the first mountain of Rome, occupied by Romulus, and where he fixed his residence and kept his court, as did Tullus Hostilius, Augustus, and all the succeeding emperors; and hence it is that the residence of princes is called palatium. The reason of the name is variously assigned: some say it is derived from the goddess Pales, or from the Palatini, who originally inhabited the place, or from balare or palare, the beatings of flutes, which were frequent there; or perhaps from the word palanter, wandering, because Evander, when he came to settle in Italy, gathered all the inhabitants, and made them all one society. To the east it has Mount Caelius, to the south the Aventine, to the west the Capitoline, and to the north the Forum.—Palatinus, the surname of Apollo from this place; where Augustus built a temple to that god, adorned with porticoes and a library, valuable for the various collections of Greek and Latin manuscripts which it contained.\n\nPALATIUM, in Ancient Geography, a place in the territory of Reate, distant from it 25 stadia. Dionysius Halicarnassus reckons it one of the first towns of the Aborigines; and from it Varro accounts for the name of the Mons Palatinus; namely, that a colony from Palatium settled there.\n\nPALATIUM (Pliny), Pallantium (Pausanias), Palateum (Livy); Pallanteum (Solinus). This last is the true writing; the great grandfather of Evander, from whom it took its name, being called Pallas, not Palas; a town of Arcadia, which concurred to form Megalopolis (Pausanias). From it the Palatium, or Mons Palatinus, takes also its name, according to Virgil and Pliny.\n\nPALATIUM Diocletiani; the villa of Diocletian, near Salona, where he died, (Eusebius.) Afterwards called Spalatum; which rose to a considerable city from the ruins of Salona; situated in Dalmatia on the Adriatic. Now Spalato, or Spalatro.\n\nPALATIUM Luculli (Plutarch), or Villa Luculli; a place between Misenum and Baiae in Campania, of wonderful structure. Now in ruins, and called Piscina Mirabile.\n\nPALATO-SALPINGÆUS, See ANATOMY, Table PALATO-STAPHYLINUS, of the Muscles.\n\nPALE, a little pointed stake or piece of wood used in making enclosures, separations, &c. The pale was an instrument of punishment and execution among the ancient Romans, and still continues so among the Turks. Hence empaling, the passing a sharp pale up the fundament through the body.\n\nPALE, in Heraldry. See HERALDRY.\n\nPALENCIA, a town of Spain, in the kingdom of Leon, with a rich archbishop's see. It had an university, but it was removed to Salamanca. It is seated in a fertile soil, on the river Carion, on the frontiers of Castile, in W. Long. 3° N. Lat. 42° 10'.\n\nPALERMO, a city of Sicily, in the Val-di-Mazara, with an archbishop's see and a large harbour. \"This city (says Mr Hill *) , which is the capital of Sicily, is of great antiquity; and if a conjecture may be formed through its ancient name Panormus, which signifies an universal harbour, it was formerly in a very flourishing condition. By whom it was founded is uncertain, nor have we any authentic accounts of its inhabitants till it became a colony of the Phoenicians, after which it passed into the hands of the various nations that became masters of this island. The present city principally consists of two wide, uniform, and well-built streets, each about a mile in length, crossing each other at right angles in the centre, where there is a small octagon space, ornamented with four statues.\" Most of the cities of Sicily have furnaces: Palermo is denominated the happy. It has gained this epithet, no doubt, on account of the advantages of its situation. It has two harbours: in the one, which is very large, and in which there is a mole 1300 paces in length, ships lie at anchor; in the other their cargoes are laden and unladen. Both the harbours open to the west: there is also a superb quay which extends a mile from west to east, in a rectilinear direction, and is called La Marine. The prospect is, on the one side, loft in the wide expanse of the ocean, and on the other confined by the walls of the city; the walls appear adorned with pillasters, and crowned with a row of balustrades through which the eye discovers a long range of palaces. These objects altogether form a delightful spectacle. Indeed nothing can be more picturesque than the bay of Palermo. It forms a large amphitheatre, with the capital of Sicily in the centre; surrounded for some miles by a most delightful country, and enclosed by romantic rocks and mountains. The town was formerly surrounded by a strong wall; but the fortifications are now entirely neglected, except towards the sea, where there are still a few weak works. The quay is the principal public walk here. Palermo is embellished all round with avenues of trees, and has four principal entrances, facing the four cardinal points, which are at the extremities of the two spacious streets which cross each other. The most frequented of these two streets is called Caffaro. It begins where the quay ends, with the north gate called Porta Felice, the happy gate; and terminates on the south, at the new gate, which opens on the road to Montreale. Near the last of these gates, this city, which so well merits the attention of a lover of the arts, exhibits a large square, round which stand some extensive monasteries, the palace of the archbishop, and the palace of the viceroy. Directly opposite to the palace of the viceroy stands, on a pedestal richly ornamented with a variety of figures, a statue of Philip IV. The statue, the pedestal, and the ornaments, are all of marble.\n\nPalermo is quite filled with public monuments, churches, monasteries, palaces, fountains, statues, and columns. These are not all eminently beautiful; for they have not been all erected under the reign of good taste; but every one of them shows that the nation is fond of the arts, and possesses a genius for decoration. Spring waters are very copious in this city. Not a quarter in Palermo but is liberally supplied with fountains.\nPalermo, tains, most of which are marble, all of them adorned with pieces of sculpture, and all afford large quantities of water.\n\nThe situation of this city is truly happy; the sea, the hills, the lofty mountains, present on all sides beautiful and striking prospects, which render it one of the most favourable situations for the genius of the artist, whose object is to copy the beauty and sublimity of nature. Freed from the fetters of the Inquisition, the abolition of which was procured by the marquis of Caraccioli, and from the influence of some other unfavourable institutions, which are rapidly declining, Palermo must become one of the finest cities in the world; and the island of which it is the capital, being all cultivated like a garden, one of the most enchanting spots on the face of the earth. Nature has denied none of her best spots to Sicily. It was the benignity of nature, which, in the happy ages of antiquity, when the political circumstances of the Sicilians were not such as to repress their genius, prompted and enabled them to erect so many illustrious monuments. \"Adjoining to the town, and near the sea, is a public garden or promenade, planted with orange and lemon trees, formed into arcades, and now loaded with fruit\"; the stems of the trees stand in furrows, and are continually watered by a small stream. In the middle is a fountain, on which stands a column of white marble, surrounded by four grotesque temples, in two of which are canary birds. Among the oranges is a kind called sanguei or bloody, which are flanked in the middle with red, and have usually the finest flavour. Some of the lemons are sweet, but very flat, tasting like sugar and water. The citrons grow to an immense size; the rind, which occupies at least three-fourths of the bulk of the fruit, is eaten with sugar; the juice is sharper than the sourest lemon. Indian figs in very great abundance grow wild in the fields and hedges, to the height of twelve or fourteen feet; of these there are three kinds, one with large spines, another with smaller, and the third almost smooth. Their fruit is cooling and delicious, worth annually to the poor people in the neighbourhood of this city. Another plant, very common in this country, is the aloe, which usually blossoms every fifth or sixth year. Of these there are five or six species, which grow mostly in the hedges, and together with the Indian figs, form a most impenetrable fence.\n\n\"The palace, which is an indifferent old building, is situated in a square, near the south gate of the city, and commands a delightful prospect of the adjacent country. At the top is an observatory, inhabited by an ingenious old priest who has been in England, and brought from thence several astronomical instruments constructed by Ramden.\" Neither the structure, situation, nor architectural ornaments of the palace are such as to merit any extraordinary praise. It is, like many others, an assemblage of buildings erected in various ages, as need of accommodation or fancy suggested; and, of consequence, it must unavoidably be defective in architectural order and beauty. The chapel is the only part of it that merits any attention. It was founded by the Counts Roger, the Norman conquerors of Sicily. Within, it is decorated with beautiful pieces of marble and porphyry, and of mosaic work in gold and various colours. It is in the same taste with the cathedral of Monreale. It is built on the same plan with common churches, only on a smaller scale. The nave is encircled with pillars; on the right and the left are two narrower openings, called lateral or low passages; the choir and sanctuary are at the end of the nave. Among all the pillars which enclose the nave, it would be hard to find two exactly of the same form and workmanship. Opposite to a channeled column stands another on which the graving tool has made no such impressions; several have neither astragal, nor base, nor scotia; they are formed of various kinds of marble, and are of different orders and unequal in height. The walls, the arcades, and the arches, are covered with mosaic work, in gold and colours, representing angels, and male and female saints.\n\nOver the entrance into the choir, and fronting the nave, there is an Eternal Father of a huge size; the design of which has, in all probability, been to impress the beholder with a sufficiently awful idea of the greatness of God. Such representations of the deity, however improper, not to say impious, occur pretty commonly in the churches of Sicily. The cathedrals of both Monreale and Palermo display the Divine Majesty with equal dignity. Over the walls of the chapel there are many pieces of granite, porphyry, and serpentine, cut into a round, or a square, or some other form, and set like panes of glass. Their edges are encircled with various draughts in gold and colours; decorations unquestionably expensive, as they are indeed very finely executed in their kind. But it is amazing that such irregularity of design was admitted in a building of such magnificence and raised at such an enormous expense. The pavement of the chapel has been originally laid, and still consists in part of large blocks of tin, porphyry, and serpentine. Most of these are round; ornamented with compartments of draughts, and covered over, as well as the walls, with incrustations of coloured mosaic work. The seat designed for the vicerey is of the same kind, and highly ornamented. The candelabrum intended to receive the wax lights at the festival of Easter is of white marble. All the riches of sculpture are lavished on it with such profusion as renders it a prodigy of labour; but in a fantastic unnatural taste.\n\nIn a long gallery in the palace of the viceroy, stand two figures of rams in bronze, concerning which we find the following tradition.—Archimedes is said to have long ago erected in one of the public squares of Syracuse four columns with a brazen ram upon the top of each. He is said to have placed them there in such a posture, as that some one of them always indicated which of the four principal winds was blowing; and it is added, that they were fabricated with such art, that the wind caused them to utter sounds exactly similar to the bleating of sheep; and whenever any one of the four bleated, he thereby gave notice that the wind was blowing from that quarter towards which he stood. It is certain (as travellers inform us) that the two brazen rams in this gallery are perforated with small holes in their flanks, close to their thighs, and in other places over their bodies; and that by blowing through those holes a sound is produced pretty much like the bleating of sheep. The wind appears to pass through the holes, and to pass out at the mouth; there might, however, be other holes in the pedestal on which the ram stood, or in other parts of the body, which might contribute to produce\nproduce the pleasing; for travellers agree in saying, that those which they could observe do not appear to be sufficient to produce the effect. The prince of Torre Muzzuza, one of the most enlightened men in Sicily, informed M. Hovel, that these two rams were dug up from among the ruins of Syracuse in the fourteenth century; as they were buried under ground, they had probably lain there for many centuries. They were bought by the Marquis Geraci, of the family of Ventimiglia, and lay long in his castle. About the end of the 15th century they were brought to Palermo, and placed in the palace of the viceroy. It is not known what became of the other two. They are probably buried in some ancient ruins, and may be one day or other discovered in digging for the foundation of some new building. The proportions of these two rams are larger than nature. They are pieces of very fine workmanship: both the heads and the horns are formed with taste, delicacy, and truth; the wool is not so well executed; the forms all together are not absolutely the finest that might be selected from among the whole species.\n\nThe cathedral of Palermo is dedicated to St Rosalia. The Sicilians, though so exceedingly devout, have however neglected to repair it; and it is at present in a most miserable state, as the interior parts appear to be falling into ruins. Proposals have been made for rebuilding it, and various plans have been shown.\n\nThe present church appears to have been built by the Counts Roger. The external parts are in a Gothic taste, and very heavy; within, it has been at different periods repaired and embellished. The pillars of the nave are adorned with pilasters of the Corinthian order; these are joined by arches through which you pass to the sides of the building. In some places it is overloaded with ornaments, in others but very poorly ornamented; viewed all together, it is so destitute of order or proportion as to be absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIn a chapel on one side of the cathedral are four Gothic tombs of the same period. They have been originally sarcophagi; and having escaped the fate of most of the other works of antiquity, have been spoiled by attempts to repair or improve them, and have been set up here to preserve the remains of some of the kings of Sicily. The only thing about them that can deserve attention is the beauty of the stone; they are of a fine red porphyry.\n\nIn the same chapel there is a fine large tabernacle; the whole of which, when viewed without distinction of the parts, resembles the dome and the front gate of the Val-de-Grace at Paris. It is of rich lapis lazuli, of the very finest colour. The whole of it is plated, and the pillars are said to be solid. All its ornaments are of gilt brass; and on the whole it is extremely beautiful.\n\nAround the church are several statues of saints by Guaglini, the celebrated sculptor. On the way from the cathedral down the Caffaro there is, on the right hand, a small square, at the entrance of which stands a pedestal statue of Charles V. in bronze. Near the place where the two great streets cross stands the senate house, in a small court, before which there is a fine marble fountain; there are besides about this edifice many curious fragments of antiquity. It would extend this article beyond all proportion if we were to mention all the curiosities which are to be found in Palermo. We shall now endeavour to give our readers an idea of the internal government of the place, which we shall do in the words of Mr Hill.\n\n\"The magistrates appointed to preserve the order of society in this city are, first, the supreme judge, to whom belongs the administration of justice in criminal cases: he is the head of the nobility, and immediately follows the viceroy in all the solemn functions. Secondly, The prator, who regulates the affairs of the city. He is the perpetual deputy of the kingdom; chief in parliament of the order to whom appertains the right of regulating the king's demesne, and possessed of the prerogative of captain-general during the absence of the viceroy. Thirdly, The praetorian court, which consists of three judges, citizens of Palermo, who are elected annually by the king. They assist the supreme judge in the decision of criminal affairs, and the prator in the deliberations upon the finances; these two officers, however, have neither vote nor signature, except the prator, in the business respecting the public funds and first fruits. Fourthly, The senate of Palermo, composed of the prator and six practitioners of the law, named by the king, who wear the toga after the manner of the ancient Roman senators, and principally inspect the police which regards the grain and provisions. There are besides seven great officers of state, to each of which is assigned a peculiar employment. First, Il Maestro Portelano, to whom is committed the care of the public granaries, and who manages the sale of the corn both at home and abroad. The imposition of a tax upon this commodity has nearly proved the ruin of agriculture, especially as the exportation of it is prohibited to all those who are not able to pay an exorbitant price for that privilege. The quantity of corn annually produced in the island does not at present amount to more than a tenth part of what was collected in former years. Secondly, The auditor general, who passes judgment without appeal upon all offences committed within the precincts of the palace. Thirdly, The high admiral, whose jurisdiction extends over the marine. Fourthly, The chancellor who overlooks all the notaries of the kingdom, prepares all official patents, reads the propositions when the parliament assembles, and at the time of a coronation tenders the oath of fidelity to the people, and also proclaims that of the monarch, who thereby binds himself to maintain and defend the privileges of the city of Palermo. The same ceremony takes place upon the infallation of a viceroy. Fifthly, The prothonotary of the queen's chamber, who has the inspection of the demesnes of five cities, viz. Syracuse, Lentini, Carlentini, St Filippo, Mineo, and Virini, which were formerly appropriated to the queens of Sicily. Sixthly, The chief secretary, who presides over the officers appointed to receive the taxes and duties in the places of their respective jurisdictions. And, seventhly, The lieutenant of the royal exchequer, who has the administration of all effects that have been sequestered or confiscated.\n\nPalermo is the principal residence of the greatest part of the Sicilian nobility; and as it is not the custom for any gentleman to walk in the streets, at least 1000 carriages are said to be kept in the town. They are for the most part in the English taste, very elegant,\nshown to the greatest advantage, with beautiful horses richly caparisoned, and as many footmen in splendid liveries as can be crowded together behind. Every evening all the people of rank drive about in this manner on the grand public terrace by the sea side. There are also very convenient hackney coaches, covered and open, waiting all day in their respective stations.\"\n\nIt is very remarkable, that the dead in Palermo are never buried. Captain Sutherland gives the following account of this circumstance in his Tour to Constantinople. The dead bodies are carried to the Capuchin convent, which is one of the largest in Italy; \"where, after the funeral service is performed, they are dried in a stove heated by a composition of lime, which makes the skin adhere to the bones. They are then placed erect in niches, and fastened to the wall by the back or neck. A piece of coarse drab is thrown over the shoulders and round the waist; and their hands are tied together, holding a piece of paper with their epitaph, which is simply their names, age, and when they died. We of course (says Captain Sutherland) visited this famous repository; and it is natural to suppose that so many corpses would impress one with reverence and awe. It was nearly dark when we arrived at the convent. We passed the chapel, where one of the order had just finished saying vespers, by the gloomy glimmering of a dying lamp. We were then conducted through a garden, where the yews, the cypresses, and the barren orange, obscured the remaining light; and where melancholy silence is only disturbed by the hollow murmuring of a feeble water fall. All these circumstances tuned our minds for the dismal scene which we were going to behold; but we had still to descend a flight of steps impervious to the sun; and, these at last, conveyed us to the dreary mansion of the dead. But (will you believe me?) notwithstanding the chilling scene through which we had passed, notwithstanding our being in the midst of more than a thousand lifeless bodies, neither our respect for the dead, nor for the holy fathers who conducted us, could prevent our smiling. The physiognomies of the deceased are so ridiculously mutilated, and their muscles so contracted and distorted in the drying, that no French mimic could equal their grimaces. Most of the corpses have lost the lower part of the nose; their necks are generally a little twisted; their mouths drawn away in one direction, their noses in another; their eyes sunk and pointed different ways; one ear perhaps turned up, the other drawn down. The friars soon observed the mirth which these unexpected visages occasioned; and one of them, as a kind of memento, pointed out to me a captain of cavalry, who had just been cut off in the pride of his youth: but three months ago, he was the minion of a king—the favourite of a princess—Alas! how changed! Even on earth there is no distinction between him and the meanest beggar. This idea in a moment restored my reflection; and I felt with full force the folly of human vanity. I turned to the holy father, who gave me this lesson. His eyes were fixed on what was once a captain of horse—I saw in them, 'Read this, titled pomp, and shrink to thy original nothingness.' Hie thee to my lady's chamber, tell her, though she paint an inch thick, to this must she come at last—make her laugh at that.'\n\nThe relations of the deceased are bound to send two wax tapers every year for the use of the convent; in default of which, the corpse is taken down and thrown into the charnel house. Were it not for the number of vacancies occasioned by the nonpayment of this stipend, the Capuchins would be unable to find niches for the number of men who must die every year in so populous a city as this. Women are dried as well as the men, but are not exposed. Nobles are shut up in chutes.\"\n\nThe number of the inhabitants is above 200,000; and the harbour though very large, is not so commodious as might be expected, and the vessels that ride therein are not always very safe. There is a magnificent cattle built near the sea side, wherein the viceroy resides six months in the year; and his presence draws a great number of nobility to this place. This city has suffered greatly by earthquakes, particularly in 1693; and it was greatly damaged by a fire in 1730, when a magazine of powder was blown up, containing 400 tons. It stands in a pleasant fruitful country, on the north-east coast of the island, and at the bottom of the gulf of the same name. E. Long. 13° 23' N. Lat. 38° 15'.\n\nPALES, in Pagan worship, the goddess of the shepherds, to whom they offered milk and honey, in order that she might deliver them and their flocks from wild beasts and infectious diseases. This goddess is represented as an old woman. She was worshipped with great solemnity at Rome; and her festivals, called Parilia, were celebrated on the 21st of April, the very day that Romulus began to lay the foundation of the city of Rome; the ceremonies of which consisted in burning heaps of straw, and leaping over them. No sacrifices were offered, but purifications were made with the smoke of horses blood, and with the ashes of a calf that had been taken from the belly of its mother after it had been sacrificed, and with the ashes of beans. The purification of the flocks was also made with the smoke of sulphur, of the olive, the pine, the laurel, and the rosemary. Offerings of mild cheese, boiled wine, and cakes of millet, were afterwards made to the goddess. Some call this festival Parilia, quae ad pariando, because the sacrifices were offered to the divinity for the fecundity of the flocks.\n\nPALESTINE, in its present state, is a part of Asiatic Turkey, situated between 31° 30' and 33° 20' north latitude, and between 34° 50' and 37° 15' east longitude. It is bounded by Mount Lebanon, which divides it from Syria, on the north; by Mount Hermon, which separates it from Arabia Deserta, on the east; by the mountains of Seir and the deserts of Arabia Petraea, on the south; and by the Mediterranean sea on the west.\n\nThis once fertile and happy spot was first called the land of Canaan, or Chanaan, from Noah's grandson. In Scripture, however, it is frequently distinguished by other names; such as the Land of Promise, the Land of God, the Land of Israel, &c. It received the name of Palestine from the Philistines or Philistines, who possessed a great part of it; and it had the name of Judea, or Judæa Palestine from Judah, the most considerable of the twelve sons of Jacob. The Christians have denominated it the Holy Land; partly on account of the many singular blessings it received from the Divine Providence, and partly on account of its metropolis being made\nPalestine made the centre of God's worship and his peculiar habitation; but much more for its being the place of our Saviour's birth, the scene of his preaching and manifold miracles; especially the place in which he accomplished the great work of our redemption. As to the name of Judea, it did not begin to receive that till after the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity, though it had been styled long before the Kingdom of Judah, in opposition to that of Israel, which revolted from it under Jeroboam, in the reign of Rehoboam the son of Solomon. But after the return, the tribe of Judah, the only one that made any figure, settling at Jerusalem, and in the countries adjacent, quickly gave its name to the whole territory. By profane authors it was called by many different names; such as Syria, Palestina Syria, Cœlophrygia, Iduma, Idumæa, and Phoenicia or Phœnice; but these are supposed only to have been given out of contempt to the Jewish nation, whom they looked upon as unworthy of any other name than what distinguished the most obscure parts of the neighbouring provinces.\n\nThat part of the country which was properly called the Land of Promise, was enclosed on the west by the Mediterranean; on the east by the lake Asphaltites, the Jordan, the sea of Tiberias or of Galilee, and the Samachonite lake; to the north it had the mountains of Libanus, or rather of Antilibanus, or the province of Phœnicia; and to the south, that of Edom or Idumæa, from which it was likewise parted by another ridge of high mountains. The boundaries of the other part, which belonged to the two tribes and a half beyond the river Jordan, are not so easily defined, as well as those of the conquests made by the more prosperous kings of the Jews. All that can be said with any probability is, that the river Arnon was the first northern boundary on that side; and with respect to those on this side the Jordan, there is a considerable disagreement between the Hebrew and Samaritan versions of the Pentateuch.\n\nThe extent of this country is likewise variously settled by geographers; some giving it no more than 170 or 180 miles from north to south, and 140 in breadth where broadest, though not much above half that breadth where narrowest. But from the latest and most accurate maps, it appears to extend near 200 miles in length, and about 80 in breadth about the middle, and about 10 or 15, more or less, where it widens or contracts.\n\nThe climate is certainly very happy, its situation being neither too far south nor too far north. The longest day is not above 14 hours 15 minutes: But the limits of Palestine appear so small, considering that the country is likewise intersected by high ridges of mountains, woods, deserts, &c., that many learned men have been induced to question what we read of its fertility and populousness in former times. It must be owned, indeed, that when we compare its ancient and flourishing state, when it was cultivated with the utmost diligence by persons well skilled in every branch of agriculture, with what it has been since the total extirpation of the Jews out of it, and more especially since it fell into the hands of the Turks, the contrast is amazingly great: but when we consider the many evident causes which have contributed to effect this change, and even yet consider the nature of the country itself, we find not the least reason to doubt the truth of what the sacred historians have related. Moses describes the richness of it in the strongest terms, even before the Israelites got possession of it. It even exceeded the land of Egypt, so much celebrated by ancient historians; especially in the vast numbers of cattle which it produced; in the quantity and excellence of its wine, oil, and fruits. With respect to the oil and fruits, it is plain, that the olives and oil of Canaan exceeded in goodness those of Egypt, since the tribes sent them thither from thence; and as for vines, Herodotus tells us, that the Egyptians had none at all, but supplied the want of them by a liquor brewed from barley. The presents which Jacob sent to his son Joseph, of honey, spices, myrrh, almonds, and other fruits of Palestine, show that they must have been much better in the land of Judea than in Egypt. The wines of Gaza, Acalon, and Sarepta, were famous among the most remote nations; (though it is allowed, that the wine which was made at and in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem, in great quantities, was equal at least, not superior, to any of the rest: and that of Libanus, mentioned by the prophet Hosea, was no less celebrated for its excellent flavour.\n\nSeveral circumstances contributed to this wonderful fecundity: such as, the excellent temperature of the air, which was never subject to excessive heats or colds; the regularity of its seasons, especially the former and latter rain; and the natural fatness and fertility of its soil, which required neither dunging nor manuring, and could be ploughed with a single yoke of oxen and a small kind of plough; for the soil was, and is still, so shallow, that to have gone deep into it, would rather have endangered than improved the crop. With respect to the excellency of its corn, we are told, that the bread of Jerusalem was preferred above all other; and the tribe of Asher produced the best of both, and in greater quantity than any other tribe; and such plenty was there of it, that, besides what sufficed the inhabitants, who made it their chief sustenance, Solomon, we read, could afford to send 20,000 cors, or measures, of it, and as many of oil, yearly, to Hiram king of Tyre; besides what they exported into other countries. And we find, even so late as King Herod, surnamed Agrippa, the countries of Tyre and Sion received most of their sustenance from his tetrarchy.\n\nAs to their fruits, the grapes were delicious, finely flavoured, and very large. The palm tree and its dates were in no less request; and the plain of Jericho, among other places, was famed for the great plenty and excellence of that fruit; infomuch, that the metropolis of that territory was emphatically styled the city of palm trees. But what both this plain, and other parts of Palestine, were most celebrated for, was the balm throb, whose balm was esteemed so precious a drug among the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, and other nations, and is still to this day under the name of balm of Gilead. They had likewise the greatest variety of other fruit trees in the highest perfection; and which might be, in some sense, styled perpetual, because they were not only covered with a constant verdure, but because the new buds always appeared on the same boughs before the old fruit was ripe; and of those buds, which were in too great quantities to be allowed to come to maturity, they gathered enough to make very delightful pickles and sweetmeats.\nPalestine, especially of their citrons, oranges, and apples of paradise, which last commonly hung by hundreds in a clutter, and as big as hens eggs, and of an excellent taste and flavour. These vines yield grapes twice, and sometimes three times a year, great quantities of which were dried up, and preserved for use, as well as their figs, plums, and other fruits. They had plenty of honey; the very trees distilled it; and the rocks yielded it in great quantities: but whether that of the latter kind was there deposited by the industrious bees, or produced some other way, is much disputed by travellers and naturalists. They likewise cultivated sugar canes in great abundance; and the cotton, hemp, and flax, were mostly of their own growth and manufacture, except some of a finer sort, that were brought to them from Egypt, and worn by those of the higher rank. Their vicinity to Lebanon made the cedars, cyprusses, and other lately fragrant trees, very common in most parts of the land, but more especially in Jerusalem. Cattle, both large and small, they fed in vast quantities; and the hilly countries not only afforded them variety and plenty of pasture, but also of water, which defended thence into the valleys and low lands, and fertilized them to the degree we have seen; besides several other rivers and brooks, some of the most remarkable of which we shall speak of in their proper places. But the most fertile pasture grounds were those on each side of the river Jordan; besides those of Sharon, or Saron, the plains of Lydda, Jannina, and some others then justly famed for their fecundity. As for fish, the river above-mentioned, the lake of Tiberias, and the Mediterranean sea, afforded, as they do to this day, great plenty and variety. Vast quantities were brought to Jerusalem, on which the inhabitants mostly subsisted; and hence one of the gates of that metropolis was, according to St Jerome, called the fish gate. The lake Asphaltites yielded salt in abundance, whereunto to season and preserve their fish, which Galen affirms to have been preferable to any other for wholesome, digestion, and extemation. In short, the Scripture is so pregnant with proofs of the extraordinary richness and fertility of this once happy land, and the vast number of people that lived in it, almost wholly upon its produce, to say nothing of the vast exports of its corn, wine, oil, raisins, and other fruits, &c., that a man must have taken a strange warp to infidelity, that can call it in question, merely on account of the melancholy and quite opposite figure it now makes under its present tyrannical government.\n\nBut its fertility has been called in question; and Voltaire and other infidel writers have raised difficulties and objections against the authority of Scripture, from the pretended sterility of the land of Judea. In answer to which, the Abbé Guénée, about the year 1780, communicated to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres at Paris, Two Memoirs concerning the Fertility of Palestine, in order to show that such objections had no solid foundation.\n\nIn the first of them, the author proves, that from the captivity of Babylon to the war of Adrian, Judæa was always considered as a rich and fertile country. The positive and multiplied authorities of the writers of that period, Jews, Greeks, and Romans, not only attest in general the fertility of that country, but many of these writers, entering into a particular detail of circumstances, prove it from the nature of the climate, the qualities of the soil, and the excellencies and variety of its productions. These are confirmed by proofs of another kind, but which are of a very convincing nature, even those resulting from a great number of medals struck under the reigns of the kings of Syria and Judea, and under the Romans, both by Jews and Pagans, and which all bear the symbols of a rich fertility. To these proofs are added a multitude of facts, recorded in the history of the Jews during this period; the efforts of the neighbouring kings to conquer their country; the long and bloody wars that the Jews carried on with vigour, and sometimes with success, against powerful princes and nations; the tribute and taxes they paid to the kings of Egypt and Syria, to the Romans, and to their own princes; the magnificence of their sovereigns, and among others of Herod; the troops he raised and kept on foot; the temples, fortresses, palaces, and cities, which he erected and embellished, not only in his own country, but also in Syria, Asia Minor, and even in Greece; the immense sums he lavished among the Romans, the donations he made to his own people, and the vast treasures which he left behind him: all these circumstances concur in proving the fertility and riches of Palestine during that period.\n\nIn the second memoir, the Abbé Guénée considers the state of Palestine as it was from the time of the emperor Adrian to the caliphate of Omar, which comprehends a period of four centuries. From sundry facts he shows, that it could not then have been the barren country which it has been represented by some sceptical writers. He particularly mentions the project formed by Adrian of rebuilding and embellishing Jerusalem, of forming it into a Roman colony, and giving it his own name; a project of which he could never have entertained a thought, if Judea, which he had seen and examined with his own eyes, had appeared to him such a barren and wretched country as it is said to be by some who have neither seen that country nor examined the matter with care and attention. Our author also produces a variety of other facts, to show that Judea, after all that it had suffered from the devastations of war both in ancient and latter times, still remained at the period in question fertile, rich, and populous. This is the idea which the writers of the time, Pagan and Christian, as well as Jewish, have given of Palestine. Antoninus Martyr, a citizen of Placentia, who in the 6th century travelled to Palestine, and composed an account of his voyage, which is still extant, says, that the canton of Nazareth was not inferior to Egypt in corn and fruits; and that though the territory of that city was not very extensive, it abounded in wine and oil, and excellent honey. The country about Jericho appeared to him still more fertile. He saw Mount Tabor, which he represents as surrounded with cities: and he observed, in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, vineyards, great plantations of fruit trees, and through the whole country a considerable number of hospitals, monasteries, and beautiful edifices. Our learned abbe, in concluding his work, acknowledges, that the opulence and fertility of Judea might begin to diminish towards the middle of the period treated of in his second memoir; but he does not think\nPalestine, think that any argument can be drawn from hence against its having been at the commencement of this period in a flourishing state; and much less can any proof be brought from hence, that in preceding periods, under the kings, or under the administration of Moles, the country of Palestine was a barren and uncultivated district.\n\nBesides, it ought to be considered, that it was then inhabited by an industrious people, who knew how to improve every inch of their land, and had made even the most deserted and barren places to yield some kind of productions, by proper care and nurture; so that the very rocks, which now appear quite bare and naked, were made to produce corn, pulse, or pasture; being, by the industry of the old inhabitants, covered with mould, which, through the laziness of the succeeding proprietors, has been since washed off with rains and storms. We may add, that the kings themselves were not above encouraging all kinds of agriculture, both by precept and example; and, above all, they had the divine blessing promised to their honest endeavours and industry: whereas it is now, and hath been long since, inhabited by a poor, lazy, indolent people, groaning under an intolerable servitude and all manner of discouragements; by which their aversion to labour and agriculture, further than what barely serves to supply their present wants, is become in a manner natural and invincible. We may further observe, after the judicious Mr Maundrell, that there is no forming an idea of its ancient flourishing state, when under the influence of heaven, from what it is now under a visible curse. And, if we had not several concurring testimonies from profane authors, who have extolled the fecundity of Palestine, that single one of Julian the Apostate, a sworn enemy to Jews and Christians, as well as to all the sacred writings, would be more than sufficient to prove it; who frequently makes mention, in his epistles, of the perpetuity, as well as excellence and great abundance, of its fruits and product. The visible effects of God's anger, which this country has felt, not only under Titus Vespasian (when myriads of inhabitants were either slain, or perished by the most severe famine, pestilence, and other calamities), and the rest laid for slaves into all lands; and new colonies sent to repeople it, who found it in such desolate state, as quite discouraged them from restoring it to its pristine fruitfulness; but much more since that emperor's time, in the inundations of the northern barbarians, of the Saracens, and of the more cruel and destructive Christians during the crusades; and in the oppression it now feels under the Turkish yoke; may be fairly owned to be more than sufficient to have wrought the dismal change we are speaking of, and to have reduced the far greater part into a mere desert.\n\nNevertheless, if we may credit those who have viewed it in this doleful condition, they will tell us, there are still such visible signs of its natural riches and fertility, as plainly show, that the bare want of culture is the main if not the only cause of its present poverty and barrenness. We shall hint, as a farther proof of this, what a learned traveller hath lately written of it from his own observations.\n\n\"The Holy Land (says Dr Shaw), were it as well peopled and cultivated as in former times, would still be more fruitful than the very best part of the coast of Syria and Phoenicia; for the soil is generally much richer, and, all things considered, yields a preferable Palestine crop. Thus the cotton that is gathered in the plains of Ramah, Edraun, and Zabulun, is in greater esteem than what is cultivated near Sidon and Tripoli. Neither is it possible for pulse, wheat, or any sort of grain to be more excellent than what is sold at Jerusalem. The barrenness, or scarcity rather, which some authors may, either ignorantly or maliciously, complain of, doth not proceed from the incapacity or natural unfruitfulness of the country, but from the want of inhabitants, and the great aversion there is to labour and industry in those few who possess it. There are, besides, such perpetual discords and depredations among the petty princes who share this fine country, that allowing it was better peopled, yet there would be small encouragement to sow, when it was uncertain who should gather in the harvest. Otherwise, the land is a good land, and still capable of affording its neighbours the like supplies of corn and oil which it is known to have done in the time of Solomon.\"\n\nAnd Volney, in his Travels in Egypt and Syria, observes, that though the whole of Palestine is almost an entire level plain, without either river or rivulet in summer, and only watered by the winter torrents, the soil is yet good, and may even be termed fertile: for when the winter rains do not fail, every thing springs up in abundance; and the earth, which is black and fat, retains moisture sufficient for the growth of grain and vegetables during the summer. More doera, fennum, water melons, and beans, are sown here than in any other part of the country. They also raise cotton, barley, and wheat; but though the latter be most esteemed, it is less cultivated, for fear of too much inviting the avarice of the Turkish governors and the rapacity of the Arabs.\n\nJudea, in its largest sense, was divided into maritime and inland, as well as into mountainous and plain; and again subdivided into Judea on this side, and Judea beyond Jordan. But the most considerable division is that which was made among the twelve tribes, by lot, to prevent all murmuring and discontent among that stubborn people; of these, two and a half were located beyond Jordan, and the rest on this side. The next remarkable was made by King Solomon, who divided his kingdom into twelve provinces or districts, each under a peculiar officer; and every one of these was to supply the king with provisions for his household in his turn; that is, each for one month in the year. But the most fatal division of all was that which obtained under his son, imprudent for Rehoboam; when ten of the twelve tribes revolted, under the conduct of Jeroboam, who became head of this new monarchy, styled the kingdom of Israel, in opposition to that of Judah, the title which distinguished the ancient kingdom of Rehoboam from that time downwards. Under the second temple the distinction lasted a considerable time, and the same bloody hatred and hostilities continued between these two kingdoms; that of Israel taking the name of Samaria from its capital. The inhabitants were a mixture of the old Israelites, and of new colonies sent thither by the kings of Assyria after their conquest of it, till they were subdued by the Maccabees, and their metropolis destroyed. Under the Romans it began to be divided into tetrarchies and toparchies; the larger were those of Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, Upper and Lower; the lesser, those of Geraritica, Sorona, and others of less note; all which lay on this side of the Jordan. The rest, on the\nthe other side, were those of Gilead, Peraza, Gaulonitis, Auranitis, Batanea, and Decapolis. Josephus mentions another division made in Gabinius's time into five districts, or, as he styles them, *civitatae* or *councils*, agreeable to the Roman manner: there were Jerufalem, Jericho, and Sephoris on this side Jordan; and Gadara and Amathus on the other. In the reigns of the Christian emperors, it was divided afresh into Palestina Prima, Palestina Secunda, and Palestina Tertia or Salutaris; which last included the far greater part, if not the whole country, as is known to all who are acquainted with history. On that account we shall waive all other divisions and changes that happened to it under the northern barbarians, Saracens, &c. and conclude this article with the present state and division of it under the Turks.\n\nThe whole country of Palestine is now reduced to a district or province, under the beglerbegate or bailiwick of Sacham or Damascus, who hath the seven following fangiacs or subgovernors under him, styled, according to the different places of their residence, 1. The fangiac of Damascus, who is under the baili of that province; 2. Of Jerufalem, or, as the Turks call it, Cudjehbarie or Cudjefcherif; 3. Aglum; 4. Bahara; 5. Scifat; 6. Gaza; 7. Nabulos. Each of these has a number of ziamets, and each ziamet a number of timariots under them; for the better understanding of which terms, we shall refer our readers to Sir Paul Rycaut's account of the Ottoman empire. At present it will be sufficient to say of these inferior subdivisions, under the fangiacs of this district, or fangiacate of Jerufalem, that it hath nine of the former and fifteen of the latter class. Neither must the reader imagine these fangiacates or sub-governments to be anything considerable, or the residence of these officers to be places of any note or opulence. The former indeed live by oppressing the people under them, and exact contributions of every thing that comes within their reach, such as the protection of travellers, merchants and caravans; but being all under their respective bailiwicks, who are still more griping than their underlings, they are commonly fleeced of some considerable part of their unjust gains. As for the places of their residence, except it be here and there one in a considerable city, as at Damascus and Jerufalem, the rest are either some old cities or even inconsiderable villages.\n\nThere are a variety of curiosities in Palestine both natural and artificial; but they are so very numerous as almost to preclude description: we therefore refer our readers to the Ancient Universal History, vol. ii. where they are mentioned and particularly described. The principal mountains, rivers, and other places of note, have already been, or will be, noticed under their respective names.\n\n**Palestrina**, a town of Italy, in the Campagna di Roma, with a bishop's see. It is the capital of a principality of the same name, and the bishop is one of the six cardinal bishops. It was anciently famous for the temple of Fortune, being then called *Princella*, and seated on the top of a mountain, the ruins of which may yet be seen. E. Long. 12. 55. N. Lat. 41. 51.\n\nPalestrina, is one of the largest and most populous of the islands called the Lagunes near Venice, and where the most considerable of the noblemen have houses of pleasure. It is 15,000 paces in length and 400 in breadth; the principal harbour has also the same name.\n\n**Palfreys**, is one of the better sort of horses used by noblemen or others for state; and sometimes of old Palcaud taken for a horse fit for a woman to ride. Camden says, that William Faconberge held the manor of Cuckney, in the county of Nottingham, in seigniory, by the service of shoeing the king's palfray when the king should come to Mansfield.\n\n**Palicaud**, or **Palgatcherry**, a fortress of considerable strength in India, which commands the passage between the two coasts of Malabar and Coromandel, by way of the Trichinopoly and Coimbetore countries: there is also a communication with it through the Nayre country. It was held by the English; and was of great importance to them, when Coimbetore was in the hands of Tipoo, because, by our holding this place on the well, and Dindigul on the east of Coimbetore, that province was of little use to him in the time of war, without a very large force to protect it. But the fall of that sovereign, and the reduction of his territories, have effected a total change of circumstances. See Memoir of a Map of the Peninsula of India by Major Rennell.\n\n**Palicate**, a sea port town of India, on the side of the Ganges. It is situated on the coast of Coromandel, in the kingdom of Carnate, 70 miles north of Fort St George. Here the Dutch had a factory, and fort called the Fort of Guelderland. E. Long. 80. 1. N. Lat. 13. 34.\n\n**Palici**, or **Palisci**, in Fabulous History, two deities, sons of Jupiter by Thalia, whom Æschylus, according to Macrobius, calls *Eïna*, in a tragedy which is lost. The nymph *Eïna*, when pregnant, begged Jupiter to remove her from the pursuit of Juno. Upon which he concealed her in the bowels of the earth; and when the time of her delivery arrived, the earth opened and brought into the world two children, to whom were given the name of *Palici*, *απὸ τοῦ πάχους γεννηθέντες*, because they came again into the world from the bowels of the earth. These deities were worshipped with many ceremonies by the Sicilians; and near their temple were two small lakes, which were supposed to have sprung out of the earth when they were born. Near these pools it was usual to take the most solemn oaths when any body wished to decide controversies and quarrels. If any of the persons who took the oaths were perjured, they were immediately punished supernaturally; and those whose oath, by the deities of the place, was sincere, departed unhurt. The Palici had also an oracle, which was consulted upon some great emergencies, and which rendered the truest and most unequivocal answers. In a superstitious age, the altars of the Palici were stained with the blood of human sacrifices; but this barbarous custom did not last long, as the deities were satisfied with the usual offerings.\n\n**Palindromus**, a verse or sentence which runs the same when read either backwards or forwards. Such is the verse,\n\n*Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor.*\n\nSome people of leisure have refined upon the Palindromus, and composed verses, each word of which is the same backwards as forwards; for instance, that of Camden:\n\n*Odo tenet mulum, maddalam mappam tenet Anna.*\n*Anna tenet mappam maddalam, mulum tenet Odo.*\n\n**Palingenesia**, among divines, the same with regeneration. Among the chemists, it denotes the producing of a body from its principles.\n\n**Palingenius,**\nPALINGENIUS, MARCELLUS, an Italian poet, well known by a poem divided into 12 books, and entitled *Zodiacus Vitæ*, which he was several years in composing, and dedicated to Hercules II. of Étée, duke of Ferrara. Some say he was a physician to that prince; others rank him among the learned Lutherans, to whom the duches of Ferrara gave a reception in her court, and honoured with her protection. His *Zodiac* contains good things, and is a philosophical satire against immorality and false prejudices. Of the author's life, however, but little is known. He died some time between the years 1537 and 1543.\n\nPALINODY, a discourse contrary to former avowed principles; hence the phrase of *palinodiam canere* was taken for a recantation.\n\nPALINURI PROMONTORIUM (Virgil, Velleius), with a cognominal port, was situated at the south extremity of the Sinus Paflagoniae on the coast of Lucania: so called from Palinurus, Æneas's steerman, who there perished (Mela, Dionysius Halicarnassus).\n\nPALINURUS, in *Fabulous History*, Æneas's pilot, whose fate Virgil very particularly describes. He fell into the sea when asleep; and was three days exposed to the tempests and its agitation, and at last came safe ashore, when the cruel inhabitants of the place murdered him to get his clothes. His body was left unburied on the sea shore: and since, according to the religion of the old Romans, no one could cross the Stygian lake before 100 years were elapsed, if his remains had not been decently buried, we find Æneas, when he went down to hell, speaking to Palinurus, and assuring him, that though his bones were deprived of a funeral, yet the place where his body was exposed should soon be adorned with a monument, and bear his name; and accordingly a promontory was called *Palinurus*.\n\nPALISADES, in fortification, stakes made of strong split wood, about nine feet long, six or seven inches square, three feet deep in the ground, in rows about two and a half or three inches asunder, placed in the covert way, at three feet from, and parallel to, the parapet or side of the glacis, to secure it from surprize. They are also used to fortify the avenues of open forts, gorges, half moons, the bottoms of ditches, and in general all posts liable to surprize. They are usually fixed perpendicularly, though some make an angle inclining towards the ground next the enemy, that the ropes cast over them to tear them up may slip off.\n\nTurning PALISADES; an invention of M. Coehorn, in order to preserve the palisades of the covert way from the besiegers shot. They are so ordered, that as many of them as stand in the length of a rod, or about ten feet, turn up and down like traps, so as not to be in sight of the enemy till they just bring on their attack; and yet are always ready to do the proper service of palisades.\n\nPALISSE, in Heraldry, a bearing like a range of palisades before a fortification, represented on a fesse, rising up a considerable height, and pointed a-top, with the field appearing between them.\n\nPALIURUS, in Botany. See Rhamnus, Botany Index.\n\nPALL, in Heraldry, a figure like a Greek γ, about the breadth of a pallet; it is by some heralds called a *crysf pall*, on account of its being looked upon as an archiepiscopal bearing.\n\nPALLA, in Roman antiquity, a mantle which women wore over the gown called *folia*. It was borne on the left shoulder; whence pafling to the other side, under the right arm, the two ends were bound under the left arm, leaving the breast and arm quite bare. It had a great many folds, and derived its name from παλλάς, to shake or tremble.\n\nPALLADIO, ANDREA, a celebrated Italian architect of the 16th century, was a native of Vicenza in Lombardy, and the disciple of Triflini. He made exact drawings of the principal works of antiquity in Rome, adding commentaries to them, which went through several impressions. But this, though a very useful work, was greatly exceeded by the *Treatise of Architecture* in four books, which he published in 1570. Inigo Jones wrote some excellent remarks on it; which were included in an edition of Palladio, published by Leoni, in two vols. folio, 1741.\n\nPALLADIUM, in antiquity, a statue of the goddess Pallas. It was about three cubits high, and represented the goddess sitting and holding a pike in her right hand, and in her left a distaff and a spindle. It fell down from heaven near the tent of Ilus, as he was building the citadel of Ilium. Some, however, suppose, that it fell at Pellas in Phrygia; or, according to others, Dardanus got it as a present from his mother Elektra. There are some who maintain, that the palladium was made with the bones of Pelops by Abaris; but Apollodorus says, that it was no more than a piece of clockwork which moved of itself. However various the opinions of ancient authors are about this celebrated statue, it is universally allowed, that on its preservation depended the safety of Troy. This fatality the Greeks, during the Trojan war, were well aware of; and therefore Ulysses and Diomedes were commissioned to steal it. This they effected; and if we can rely upon the authority of some, they were directed how to carry it away by Helenus, a son of Priam, who in this betrayed his country, because his brother Deiphobus, at the death of Paris, had married Helen, of whom he was enamoured. Minerva was enraged at the violence offered to her statue; and, according to Virgil, the palladium itself seemed to have received life and motion; and by the flashes which started from its eyes, and sudden springs from the earth, it seemed to show the resentment of the goddess. The true palladium, as is observed by some, was not carried away from Troy by the Greeks, but only a statue of similar size and shape, which was placed near it, to deceive whatever sacrilegious persons attempted to steal it. The palladium, therefore, as they maintain, Æneas conveyed safe from Troy to Italy, and it was afterwards preserved by the Romans with the greatest secrecy and veneration in the temple of Veii; a circumstance which none but the vestal virgins knew. It was esteemed the deliny of Rome; and there were several others made perfectly like it, to secure it from being stolen, as was that of Troy, which the oracle of Apollo declared should never be taken so long as the palladium was found within its walls. A palladium was also placed by Nicias in the citadel of Athens.\n\nPALLADIUM, one of the newly discovered metals, which is found alloyed with platinum. See Chemistry Index, and Ores, Reduction of, under Platina.\n\nPALLADIUS, bishop of Helenopolis in Bithynia, and then of Aspona. He was a Galatian, and born at Cappadocia.\nCappadocia. He became an anchorite in the mountain of Nebria in 388, and was consecrated a bishop in 401. He was an intimate friend of St John Chrysostom, whom he never forsook during the time of his persecution, nor even in his exile. He went to Rome some time after Chrysostom's death, and at the request of Laetus governor of Cappadocia, composed the History of the Anchorites or Hermits, and entitled it *Laylaaca*, after the name of that lord, to whom he dedicated it in 420, when it was written, being then the 20th year of his episcopacy, and 53rd of his age. Palladius was accused of being an Origenist. It is true, he was an enemy to St Jerome, of whom he does not speak well, and was intimately connected with Rufinus; but perhaps no good proof can be brought of his Origenism. He had been the disciple of Evagrius of Pontus, and was even suspected of entertaining the sentiments of Pelagius. He died in the 5th century, but in what year is not certain. His History was published in Greek by Meursius at Amsterdam in 1619, and in Latin in the *Bibliotheca Patrum*; but he seems not to have been the writer of the Life of St John Chrysostom, in Greek and Latin by M. Bigot printed in 1660.\n\nPALLAS, a freed man of Claudius, celebrated for the power and the riches which he obtained. He advised the emperor his master to marry Agrippina, and to adopt her son Nero for his successor. It was through him and Agrippina that the death of Claudius was hastened, and that Nero was raised to the throne. Nero, however, forgot to whom he was indebted for it. He discarded Pallas, and some time after caused him to be put to death, that he might procure his great riches.\n\nPALLAS, a small planet lately discovered, and belonging to the solar system. See PLANET.\n\nPALLAVICINI, FERRANTE, an Italian writer, descended from a noble family in Fiaccia, was born about the close of the 16th century. He soon gave proofs of an extraordinary genius, and quickly improved in classical erudition. He was afterwards sent to complete his education in the monastery of Augustinians at Milan, where he took the habit, lived much esteemed for piety and learning, and raised great expectations of future fame; but being somewhat amorously inclined, he engaged in an intrigue with a young countess of Venice, whose charms proved irresistible; and in order to enjoy them without restraint, he obtained leave from his general to make the tour of France. Accordingly, he pretended to set out for that country; but it was only a blind to cover his real design. He never left Venice, but lived there privately, enchanted in the arms of his Venus; and having too ready a talent at invention, he imposed upon his friends by often feeding them in letters feigned accounts of his travels through France; also informing them of several things respecting that court, which he learned from the advices of many considerable persons with whom he corresponded.\n\nHis finances were in the mean time greatly reduced; and in this exigence he naturally had recourse to his wits for supplies. He wrote for the bookellers; and composed several pieces, more for the sake of lucre than out of fondness for authorship. Among other things, he wrote a collection of letters, mostly satirical, which he called *The Courier Robbed of his Mail*. The work appeared at first in such a cast, as could not give great offence except to the Spaniards, against whom he had Pallavicini's grudge. The piece was accordingly licensed by the inquisitors; but falling into the hands of the secretary of the republic of Venice, who at that time was licenser of books, he would not give his imprimatur, though great interest was employed for that purpose; neither would he return the manuscript. This enraged Pallavicini so much, that had not his friends restrained him, he would have pursued the affair to his ruin.\n\nAt length he found an opportunity of travelling into Germany with the duke of Amalfi as his chaplain. This journey, as was to be expected, had no good effect either upon his wit or his morals. On the contrary, finding himself, from the manners of the Germans, more at liberty, he indulged his genius and passions with greater ease; and after a residence there of upwards of a year with the duke, he returned to Venice. He was now resolved to have his full measure of revenge against the secretary of the republic for keeping his manuscript; and with him, his resentment joined the family of Barberini, Pope Urban VIII., and his nephews, because they also endeavoured, at the instigation of the Jesuits, to get all his manuscripts forbid the press. In this rancorous spirit he cast his Courier into a new model, and enlarged it with many letters and discourses. Thus new modelled, he offered it to a bookeller, who undertook to get it printed; but our author was betrayed by a pretended friend; who acted the part of a spy, and informed the archbishop of Vitelli, then the pope's nuncio at Venice, just as the work was finished at the press; at the same time, this treacherous friend bought the whole impression; and upon the nuncio's complaint, Pallavicini was imprisoned. In this miserable condition he found a friend in one of his mistresses, who, seeing him abandoned by most of his patrons, not only supported him, but conveyed letters to him, by which he gave him such information as enabled him to make a proper defence, and to recover his liberty.\n\nBut a war having in the mean time broken out between the Barberini and the duke of Parma; Pallavicini, in order to revenge himself upon the supposed instruments of his imprisonment, wrote a piece entitled \"The tinkling Instrument to call together the Barberini Bees;\" and dedicated it in terms of the profoundest contempt to the nuncio Vitelli. The nuncio, finding that little notice was taken of his complaints on the occasion, procured by bribery one Charles Morfu, a Frenchman of infamous character, who pretended to pass for a gentleman, to ensnare Pallavicini; to which end, the traitor used his best endeavours to insinuate himself into his friendship, and at length exhorted him to accompany him to France. He declared that his fortune would be made by the extraordinary encouragement which was given to men of letters by Cardinal Richelieu; and the better to favour the deceit, he produced feigned letters from the Cardinal, inviting our author to France, and expressing a desire he had to establish in Paris an academy for the Italian tongue, under the direction of Pallavicini. The snare took; and now, fascinated by the prospect of gain, Pallavicini suffered himself to be led like an ox to the slaughter, wheresoever Morfu thought proper. He left Venice much against the advice of his friends, and went first to Bergamo, where he spent a\nPallavicini few days with some of his relations, by way of giving some entertainment to Morfu. They then set off for Geneva, to the great satisfaction of our author, who proposed to get some of his works printed there, which he had not been able to do in Italy. Morfu, however, instead of conducting him to Paris, took the road to Avignon; where, crossing the bridge of Sorces, in the county of Venaillan, they were seized by a gang of robbers, or sheriff's officers, on pretence of carrying contraband goods, and confined. Morfu was quickly discharged, and very liberally rewarded; but Pallavicini, being carried to Avignon, was imprisoned; and notwithstanding, on his examination concerning some papers found upon him, he made a very artful defence, it was in vain. The sentence was already brought from Rome, and he was to undergo a trial merely for form's sake. For this purpose being put into a dark dungeon, he made another effort to escape. He managed matters so well with his keeper, as to procure wax candles to be allowed him, under pretence of amusing himself with reading, and when he had got a number of these, he let fire one night to the prison door, in order to get off by that means; but the stratagem did not succeed, and he was of course confined much closer, and treated with great humanity. After a year's suffering, he was brought to trial, in which he made an excellent defence, and flattered himself with hopes of relief. He had even begun a whimsical piece on the subject of melancholy; but, contrary to his expectations, he was sentenced to die, and lost his head on a scaffold in the flower of his age.\n\nHe was of so headless and profuse a disposition, that had he possessed an immense estate he would have spent it all. He was never engaged in a virtuous passion, being inflamed to a prodigious and unnatural degree with the love of the meanest and most infamous prostitutes. On the other hand, no one could be more sincere and faithful in his friendships, nor was ever a man a greater prey to treachery; inasmuch, that when released from prison in Venice, he was told that a wretch had betrayed him, he could not be prevailed upon to believe it, saying, \"How can this be, since he declared himself my friend, and I made him privy to all my concerns?\" He used, while he wore a religious habit, to study or write two or three hours in bed every morning. The rest of the day he spent either in the company of idle persons, or else with the ladies; but after he had wholly left the monastic life, upon pretence of securing himself from the snares of his enemies, he lived in a very irregular manner. He was possessed of a fine genius, had a great facility in writing; and till he was corrupted by the commerce of mean lewd women, he wrote pieces worthy of immortality. He did not spend much time or pains either in composition or in revision, for he frequently sent to the press the very first exertions of his genius; yet nature had given him so noble a vein of eloquence, which he had greatly improved by perusing the best authors, that his first thoughts were often equal to the most laboured compositions. He was modest, and spoke of himself with diffidence; but his works are strongly tinged with envy, malice, and gall. He made but a poor figure in conversation; and when with persons of worth and distinction, would often retire to a corner of the room, and seem quite wrapt up in thought. He never exerted his wit and humour after his return from Germany, but when he was in the company of some mean women. Upon the whole, it is difficult to determine whether vice or virtue was the most predominant feature in his character. His death gave birth to a dialogue, entitled, *Anima erranti di Ferrante Pallavicini*, or, \"The wandering Ghost of Pallavicini.\" Besides his life at the head of his works in two volumes, there is another prefixed to the \"Divortio celeste,\" at Amsterdam, 1696.\n\n**PALLENE**, a small peninsula of Thrace or Macedonia, formerly called Phlegra. It is situated near the bay of Thermae, and contains five cities, the principal of which is called Pallene. It was famous, according to some of the ancients, for an engagement between the gods and the giants.\n\n**PALLET**, among painters, a little oval table, or piece of wood or ivory, very thin and smooth; on and round which the painters place the several colours they have occasion for, to be ready for the pencil. The middle serves to mix the colours on, and to make the tints required in the work. It has no handle, but, instead thereof, a hole at one end to put the thumb through to hold it.\n\n**PALLET**, among potters, crucible makers, &c., a wooden instrument, almost the only one they use, for forming, beating, and rounding their works. They have several kinds: the largest are oval, with a handle; others are round, or hollowed triangularly; others, in fine, are in manner of large knives, serving to cut off whatever is superfluous on the moulds of their work.\n\n**PALLET**, in gilding, an instrument made of a squirrel's tail, to take up the gold leaves from the pillow, and to apply and extend them on the matter to be gilt. See Gilding.\n\n**PALLET**, in Heraldry, is nothing but a small pale, consisting of one half of it in breadth, and therefore there are sometimes several of them upon one shield.\n\n**PALLET**, is also a part belonging to the balance of a watch or movement. See the article Watch.\n\n**PALLIATÆ**, a name which the Romans gave to such plays as laid the plot in Greece, and required the performers to appear in Grecian habits. It is used in contradistinction to *togatæ*, in which the scene was laid at Rome, and in which the dresses were Roman. The word palliatæ is derived from *pallium*, which was a part of dress peculiar to the Greeks; whereas the toga belonged to the Romans only. See Togatæ, Comedy, &c.\n\n**PALLIATION**, or a Palliative Cure, in medicine, is when, in desperate and incurable diseases, after predicting the fatal event, the physician prescribes some remedies for mitigating the pain or some other urgent symptoms, as in ulcerated cancers, or cancerous fistulas, and the like.\n\n**PALLIO Cooperire**. It was an ancient custom, where children were born out of lawful wedlock, and their parents were afterwards married, that those children, together with the father and mother, should stand *pallio cooperi*, under a cloth, while the marriage was solemnized; which was a kind of adoption, and had the effect of a legitimation. Thus Robert Grofthead, the famous bishop of Lincoln, in one of his letters says: *In signum legitimationis, nati ante matrimonium confec-\nPALLIUM, a word often mentioned in our old historians. Durandus tells us, that it is a garment made of white wool, after the following manner, viz. The nuns of St Agnes, every year, on the feast day of their saint, offer two white lambs on the altar of their church, during the time they sing Agnus Dei, in a solemn mass; which lambs are afterwards taken by two of the canons of the Lateran church, and by them given to the pope's subdeacons, who send them to pasture till shearing time, and then they are shorn, and the pall is made of their wool mixed with other white wool. The pall being thus made, is carried to the Lateran church, and there placed on the high altar, by the deacons of that church, on the bodies of St Peter and St Paul; and after an usual watching, it is carried away in the night, and delivered to the subdeacons, who lay it up safe. And because it was taken from the body of St Peter, it signifies the plenitude of ecclesiastical power: and therefore it was the prerogative of popes, who pretend to be the immediate successors of that saint, to invest other prelates with it; which at first was done nowhere but at Rome, though afterwards at other places.\n\nPALLIUM, in antiquity, an upper garment or mantle worn by the Greeks, as the toga was by the Romans. Each of these was so peculiar to the respective nations, that Palliatus is used to signify a Greek, and Togatus a Roman.\n\nPALM, has among almost all nations been regarded as an emblem of victory, and assigned as the reward of it. The reason why this tree was adopted, and made use of to represent victory, is said to be, because it is so elastic, that if pressed by the great weight, it will rise superior to the pressure, and be able to restore itself to its former state, appearing almost invincible.\n\nPALM-Sunday, in the Christian church, the Sunday next before Easter; being so called in memory of our Saviour's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, when the multitude that attended him threw branches on his way.\n\nThe ancients had other names for this day. For, 1. They call it Dominica Competentium, i.e. Sunday of the Competentest; because on that day the catechumens came to ask the bishop leave to be admitted to baptism, which was conferred the Sunday following. They had also then given them the symbol or credo, to get off by heart, to be repeated to the bishop in the ceremony of baptism. 2. They called it Capitulum, the Sunday of washing the head; because those who were to be baptized the following Sunday were prepared by washing their heads on this day. Some time afterwards they called it Indulgence Sunday, because the emperors and patriarchs used to distribute gifts on that day.\n\nPALM-Tree. See PHOENIX, BOTANY Index.\n\nPALMA, or PALMA Nova, a very strong town of Italy, in Friuli, in the territory of Venice. It is a very important place, for the defence of the Venetians against the Austrians and Turks; and was built in 1593, for that very purpose. They have cut a canal near this place, which is very advantageous. It is located on the sea side, 10 miles south-east of Udine, and 55 from Venice. E. Long. 13° 15'. N. Lat. 46° 2'.\n\nPALMA, an island in the Atlantic ocean, and one of the Canaries, 56 miles north-west of Gomera, and about 75 in circumference. It abounds in wine and sugar; and has a handsome town of the same name, which carries on a trade in wine to the West Indies and other parts. Their best vines grow in a soil called the Brenia, where they make 12,000 butts of wine every year, which is well known by the name of palm wine. There is plenty of cattle, and all sorts of fruits. In 1625 a volcano broke out in this island, with a most violent earthquake; the flame was seen for six weeks together, and a great quantity of ashes were thrown as far as Teneriffe. It was conquered by the Spaniards in 1460.\n\nPALMÆ, Palms. Under this name Linnaeus has arranged several genera, which, although capable of a place in separate classes of his system, he chooses rather, on account of their singular structure, to place apart, in an appendix to the work.—See BOTANY Index.\n\nThe same plants constitute one of the seven families or tribes into which all vegetables are distributed by Linnaeus in his Philosophia Botanica. They are defined to be plants with simple stems, which at their summit bear leaves resembling those of the ferns, being a composition of a leaf and a branch; and whose flowers and fruit are produced on that particular receptacle or seat called a spathe, protruded from a common calyx in form of a sheath or scabbard, termed by Linnaeus spathe.\n\nPalme is likewise the name of the first order in Linnaeus's Fragments of a Natural Method.\n\nPALMARIS MUSCLE, in Anatomy. See there, Table of the Muscles.\n\nPALMATED, something resembling the shape of the hand: thus we say, palmated leaves, roots, stones, &c.\n\nPALMERSTON'S ISLAND, situated in the South Seas, which Captain Cook visited in his second and last voyages. It consists of a group of small islets, nine or ten in number, connected by a reef of coral rocks, and lying in a circular direction. It admits of no anchorage, nor are there any inhabitants on it, though it abounds with cocoa nuts, sycamore grapes, and the wharrah tree. This island is not more than a mile in circumference, and is not elevated above three feet above the level of the sea. It consists entirely of a coral sand, with a small mixture of blackish mould, which appeared to be produced from rotten vegetables. \"At one part of the reef (say our navigators), which bounds the lake within, almost even with the surface, there was a large bed of coral, which afforded a most enchanting prospect. Its base, which was fixed to the shore, extended so far that it could not be seen, so that it appeared to be suspended in the water. Even this delightful scene was greatly improved by the multitude of fishes that gently glided along, seemingly with the most perfect security. Their colours were the most beautiful that can be imagined, blue, yellow, black, red, &c., far exceeding any thing that can be produced by art.

The Grecian palmus was of two sorts; the greater, which contained nine finger breadths, and the less which contained four. The Roman palmus was also of two sorts; the greater, which contained twelve finger breadths, or eight inches and a half English; and the less, which contained four finger breadths, or near three inches English.—The great palmus was taken from the length of the hand or span; the less from the breadth of it. The Greek palmus was called doran. See MEASURE.\n\nPALMYRA, or Tadmor, a noble city of ancient Syria, now in ruins, the origin of whose name is uncertain. Neither is it well known by whom this city was built; for though, from the identity of the names, it is thought by many to have been the Tadmor in the wilderness built by Solomon*, this point, however, is much controverted by many learned men. For the world have been long and justly astonished to find in the desert of Syria, at a distance from the sea, with a very precarious and scanty supply of water only, and without a particular connexion with any great monarchy, ruins of a city more extensive and splendid than Rome itself, the depository of all the arts which Greece in its most flourishing periods could afford. The problem is an intricate one; yet when we divest it of many of its difficulties, we shall bring this stupendous prodigy to no very uncommon magnitude. The coast of Syria was in very early ages rich and populous; and either from the convenience of procuring water, or from the vicinity of India and Egypt, the population, instead of increasing on the mountains, extended to Judea, and from thence through its plains only to the internal parts. The ruins of this numerous people, and of their habitations, remain; but as their edifices were not uncommonly splendid, or, as the causes of their destruction were powerful, they have not attracted much attention. Yet the ruins of more than 30 towns are discoverable to the south-east of the Dead Sea, and from thence towards Tadmor or Palmyra; we know the cause of the destruction of these towns, and we know that it did not reach Palmyra. This splendid city was not, therefore, insulated in a mass of sand: it was probably a link of a continued chain of population, or perhaps its termination. The situations of towns in the sandy desert must necessarily be determined by local advantages. Tadmor is situated where two hills converge, and beyond the point where they approach. These hills afforded water, that necessary aid to animal life; and the aqueducts through which it was brought from them were discovered and described by Mr Wood. Though the other towns now in ruins afford some remains of luxury and opulence, yet in these respects they are much inferior to Palmyra; and this deserves to be explained. Palmyra was undoubtedly very ancient. “The two springs of fresh water it possessed (says Volney†) were, above all, a powerful inducement in a desert everywhere else so parched and barren. These, doubtless, were the two principal motives which drew the attention of Solomon, and induced Egypt, that commercial prince to carry his arms so remote from the limits of Judea.” “He built strong walls there (says the historian Josephus), to secure himself in the possession, and named it Tadmor, which signifies the Place of Palm trees.” Hence it has been inferred that Solomon was its first founder; but we should, from this passage, be rather led to conclude that it was already a place of known importance. The palm trees he found there are not the trees of uninhabited countries. Prior to the days of Moses, the journeys of Abraham and Jacob from Mesopotamia into Syria, sufficiently prove a communication between these countries, which must soon have made Palmyra flourish. The cinnamon and pearls mentioned in the time of the Hebrew legislator, demonstrate a trade with India and the Persian gulf, which must have been carried on by the Euphrates and Palmyra. At this distance of time, when the greater part of the monuments of these early ages have perished, we are liable to form very false opinions concerning the state of these countries in those remote times, and are the more easily deceived, as we admit as historical facts antecedent events of an entirely different character. If we observe, however, that men in all ages are united by the same interests and the same desires, we cannot help concluding, that a commercial intercourse must early have taken place between one nation and another, and that this intercourse must have been nearly the same with that of more modern times. Without, therefore, going higher than the reign of Solomon, the invasion of Tadmor by that prince is sufficient alone to throw a great light on the history of this city. The king of Jerusalem would never have carried his attention so distant and detached a spot, without some powerful motive of interest; and this interest could be no other than that of an extensive commerce, of which this place was already the emporium. This commerce extended itself to India; and the Persian gulf was the principal point of union.”\n\nFrom the nature of the commodities, from the requisite affluence of the Tyrians, and other forcible arguments, M. Volney shows that the Persian gulf was the centre of the most ancient commerce of the eastern world; and that it was with a view of obtaining a shorter route, by means of the Euphrates, that Solomon turned his attention to Tadmor, distant but three days' journey from it. Our author goes on, “We may even reasonably conjecture, when we reflect on the revolutions of the following ages, that this commerce became a principal cause of those various wars in Lower Asia, for which the barren chronicles of those early times assign no motives. If, after the reign of Solomon, the Assyrians of Nineveh turned their ambitious views towards Chaldea, and the lower part of the Euphrates, it was with the intention to approach that great source of opulence the Persian gulf. If Babylon, from being the vassal of Nineveh, in a short time became her rival, and the seat of a new empire, it was because her situation rendered her the emporium of this lucrative trade; in short, if the kings of this great city waged perpetual...\nPalmyra, wars with Jerusalem and Tyre, their object was not only to depose the cities of their riches, but to prevent their invading their trade by the way of the Red Sea. An historian who has informed us that Nabuchodonosor, before he laid siege to Jerusalem, took possession of Tadmor, clearly indicates that the latter city acted in concert with the two neighbouring capitals. Their gradual decline became, under the Persian empire, and the successors of Alexander, the efficient cause of the sudden greatness of Palmyra in the time of the Parthians and Romans; she then enjoyed a long peace for many centuries, which allowed her inhabitants to erect those monuments of opulence whose ruins we still admire.\n\nIf the former observations showed the connection of this remote spot with a more populous country, these remarks explain the cause of the renovation, and of the magnificence of this city. Our author's remarks are at least probable, and are, in our opinion, very convincing. Cairo, in another, probably a subordinate route, never attained the splendour of Palmyra; but the genius of the Egyptians, perhaps the laws of Egypt, prevented it.\n\nThere is, however, no authentic history of Palmyra till after the captivity of the Roman emperor Valerian by the Persians. It is first mentioned by the Roman historians, as a place which Mark Antony attempted to plunder, upon pretence that it had not observed a just neutrality between the Romans and Parthians. Pliny takes notice of it as being situated in a rich soil, among pleasant streams, and totally separated from the rest of the world by a vast sandy desert, which had preserved its independence between Parthia and Rome. There is still a considerable spot of good soil next the town and on the hills; and even in the wilderness, there were palms and fig trees, some of which remained till the latter end of the 17th century, though not one is now to be found.\n\nAfter the captivity of Valerian, it was become an opulent city, to which its situation in the vicinity of the Roman and Parthian empires greatly contributed; as the caravans, in going to or returning from the east, frequented the place, and thus rendered it a considerable seat of merchandise. It enjoyed an independency till the time of Trajan; who, having made himself master of almost all the Parthian empire, reduced Palmyra likewise, and it was afterwards accounted part of the Roman dominions. But when the defeat and captivity of Valerian had so much weakened the empire, that the Persians seemed to be in a fair way of becoming masters of all the eastern provinces, the Palmyrenians began to entertain thoughts of recovering their liberty. Odenathus, prince of Palmyra, sent a very respectable letter to Sapor on his return, accompanied with considerable presents; but by that haughty conqueror his letter and embassy were treated with the most provoking contempt. The presents were thrown into the Euphrates; and to his letter Sapor replied, That his insolence in presuming to write to his lord was inexcusable; but if he could stone for it in any way, it would be by presenting himself before the throne, bound hand and foot, in token of a confidenceness of his crime, and the punishment he deserved. With this injurious treatment Odenathus was provoked, that he swore either to bring down the pride of the haughty conqueror, or die in the attempt. Accordingly, having assembled what forces he could, he fell upon the Persians, destroyed a number of them, took a great part of their baggage, and some of the king's concubines. Of the war of Odenathus with the Persians, however, we know very little: only that though the latter were often vanquished and the independency of Palmyra established for the present; yet Valerian was never released from his captivity, though Odenathus earnestly wished to have the honour of rescuing him from his enemies.\n\nOdenathus enjoyed his sovereignty but a very short time; being murdered by his nephew, who was soon after put to death by Zenobia the wife of Odenathus. This lady is said to have been possessed of very extraordinary endowments both of body and mind, being, according to Mr Gibbon, almost the only Asiatic woman who is recorded to have overcome the obstacles arising from the confined situation of the fair sex in that part of the world. Immediately on taking vengeance for the murder of her husband, she assumed the government, and soon strengthened herself so much, that she resolved to submit neither to the Roman nor Persian power. The neighbouring states of Arabia, Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the inheritance of her ancestors, the populous and fertile kingdom of Egypt. The emperor Claudius acknowledged her merit, and was content, that while he pursued the Gothic war, she should affect the dignity of the empire in the east. The conduct, however, of Zenobia, was attended with some ambiguity; nor is it unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular manners of Roman princes the flatly pomp of the courts of Asia, and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to the successors of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons a Latin education, and often showed them to the troops adorned with the imperial purple. For herself she referred the diadem, with the splendid but doubtful title of Queen of the east.\n\nWhen Aurelian passed over into Asia, against an adversary whose sex alone could render her an object of contempt, his presence restored obedience to the province of Bithynia, already shaken by the arms and intrigues of Zenobia. Advancing at the head of his legions, he accepted the submission of Ancyra; and was admitted into Tyana, after an obstinate siege, by the help of a perfidious citizen. The generous, though fierce temper of Aurelian, abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers: a superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the countrymen of Apollonius the philosopher. Antioch was deserted on his approach; till the emperor, by his salutary edicts, recalled the fugitives, and granted a general pardon to all who, from necessity rather than choice, had been engaged in the service of the Palmyrenean queen. The unexpected mildness of such a conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians, and as far as the gates of Emesa, the wishes of the people seconded the terror of his arms.\n\nZenobia would have ill deserved her reputation, had she indolently permitted the emperor of the West to approach within 100 miles of her capital. The fate of the East was decided in two great battles; so familiar in almost every circumstance, that we can scarcely distin-\nguish them from each other, except by observing that the first was fought near Antioch, and the second near Emesa. In both, the queen of Palmyra animated the armies by her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders on Zabdias, who had already signalized his military talents by the conquest of Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia consulted for the most part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They fled in rear or affected disorder, engaged the Palmyrenians in a laborious pursuit, harassed them by a deftly combat, and at length discomfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of cavalry. The light infantry, in the mean time, when they had exhausted their quivers, remaining without protection against a closer onset, exposed their naked sides to the swords of the legions. Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops, who were usually stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose valour had been severely tried in the Allemannic war. After the defeat of Emesa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army. As far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her empire had joined the standard of the conqueror; who detached Probus, the bravest of his generals, to possess himself of the Egyptian provinces. Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of Odenathus. She retired within the walls of her capital; made every preparation for a vigorous resistance; and declared with the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last moment of her reign and of her life should be the same.\n\nIn his march over the sandy desert, between Emesa and Palmyra, the emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs; nor could he always defend his army, and especially his baggage, from those flying troops of active and daring robbers, who watched the moment of surprise, and derided the slow pursuit of the legions. The siege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and important; and the emperor, who with incessant vigour pressed the attacks in person, was himself wounded with a dart. \"The Roman people,\" says Aurelian in an original letter, \"speak with contempt of the war which I am waging against a woman. They are ignorant both of the character and of the power of Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations, of stones, of arrows, and of every species of missile weapons. Every part of the walls is provided with two or three balistae, and artificial fires are thrown from her military engines. The fear of punishment has armed her with a desperate courage. Yet I trust still in the protecting deities of Rome, who have hitherto been favourable to all my undertakings.\" Doubtful, however, of the protection of the gods, and of the event of the siege, Aurelian judged it more prudent to offer terms of an advantageous capitulation: to the queen, a splendid retreat; to the citizens, their ancient privileges. His proposals were obstinately rejected, and the refusal was accompanied with insult.\n\nThe firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope that in a very short time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the desert; and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the East, and particularly the Persian monarch, would arm in the defence of their most natural ally. But fortune, and the perseverance of Aurelian, overcame every obstacle. The death of Sapor, which happened about this time, distracted the councils of Persia; and the inconsiderable succours that attempted to relieve Palmyra were easily intercepted either by the arms or the liberality of the emperor. From every part of Syria a regular succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp, which was increased by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from the conquest of Egypt. It was then that Zenobia resolved to fly. She mounted the fleetest of her dromedaries; and had already reached the banks of the Euphrates, about 60 miles from Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian's light-horse, seized, and brought back a captive to the feet of the emperor. Her capital soon after surrendered, and was treated with unexpected lenity. The arms, horses, and camels, with an immense treasure of gold, silver, silk, and precious stones, were all delivered to the conqueror; who, leaving only a garrison of 600 archers, returned to Emesa, and employed some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments at the end of so memorable a war, which restored to the obedience of Rome those provinces that had renounced their allegiance since the captivity of Valerian.\n\nWhen the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian, he sternly asked her, How she had presumed to rise in arms against the emperors of Rome? The answer of Zenobia was a prudent mixture of respect and firmness: \"Because I disdained to consider as Roman emperors an Aurelius or a Gallienus. You alone I acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign.\" But as female fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of trial; she trembled at the angry clamours of the soldiers, who called aloud for her immediate execution; forgot the generous despair of Cleopatra, which she had professed as her model; and ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her friends. It was to their councils, which governed the weaknesses of her sex, that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance; it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the cruel Aurelian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear, will survive that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him. Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered soldiery, but they had served to elevate and harmonise the soul of Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the executioner, pitying his unhappy mistresses, and bestowing comfort on his afflicted friends.\n\nReturning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already crossed the straits which divide Europe from Asia, when he was provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred the governor and garrison which he had left among them, and again erected the standard of revolt. Without a moment's deliberation, he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges, that old men, women, children, and peasants, had been involved in that dreadful execution, which should have been confined to armed rebellion: and although his principal concern seems directed to the re-establishment of a temple.\ntemple of the sun, he discovers some pity for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants the permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But it is easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts, and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling fortress, and at length a miserable village.\n\nLittle is known concerning the fortunes of Palmyra since the time of Mahomet, except that it was considered as a place of strength; and that in the 12th century there were 2000 Jews in it. With respect to the ruins, they appeared to be of two different and distinct periods; the oldest are so far decayed as not to admit of menuration, and look as if they had been reduced to that state by the hand of time; the others appear to have been broken into fragments by violence. Of the inscriptions none are earlier than the birth of Christ, and none are later than the destruction of the city by Aurelian, except one, which mentions Diocletian.\n\nMr Wood is of opinion, that the face of the country which surrounds Palmyra was always the same; but though Palmyra was always said to be situated in a wilderness, it does not follow that the wilderness was always of the same extent: It is perhaps more probable, that when Palmyra was first settled, the rich soil mentioned by Pliny extended much farther; for whatever were the reasons for making a settlement there, Palmyra can scarcely be supposed to have invited a greater number of people than it could feed. The palms and fig trees that were formerly found on the hills, and in the borders of the desert, that are now totally barren, confirm this opinion. Mr Wood observes, that while he was there a whirlwind happened, which took up such quantities of sand as quite darkened the sky; this sand therefore might by degrees encroach upon the fertile environs of Palmyra, and reduce the number of inhabitants as it reduced their sustenance, till the few wretched families only were left, who found it difficult to furnish food for Mr Wood and his company, though they did not continue longer than a fortnight among them. It will also appear from history, that what is supposed to have happened here has happened at other places, where such an event was much less probable.\n\nOn the sea coast in the neighbourhood of St Pol de Leon, in Lower Bretagne, there is a considerable tract of land which before the year 1666 was inhabited, but which was rendered uninhabitable by a sand, which encroaching every year, covered it to the depth of above 20 feet. In the year 1718 it had advanced more than five leagues, and within one league of St Pol; so that it was then thought probable that the town would of necessity be abandoned. This sand is raised by the east or north-east wind, which drives it in clouds with great swiftness, and in a prodigious quantity. It was also attested by the captain of a ship, and all on board, that in the year 1719 there fell in the Atlantic ocean, at 15 degrees of north latitude, and at the distance of more than eight leagues from any land, a shower of sand, some of which they produced, and deposited in the academy at Paris.\n\nThe company with whom Mr Wood, the publisher of the Ruins of Palmyra, travelled, arrived at length at the end of the plain, where a ridge of barren hills, by which it was divided on the right and left, seemed to meet; between them there was a vale, through which an aqueduct formerly conveyed water to Palmyra. On each side of this vale they remarked several sepulchres of the ancient Palmyrenes, which they had scarcely passed, when the hills opening on a sudden, they discovered such piles of ruin as they had never seen. They were all of white marble; and beyond them, towards the Euphrates, was a wide level, stretching farther than the eye could reach, totally defoliate, without variety, and without bounds. After having gazed some time upon this prospect, which rather exceeded than fell short of their expectations, they were conducted to one of the huts of the Arabs, of which there are about 30 in the court of the great temple. The inhabitants of both sexes were well shaped, and the women, though very dwarfish, had good features. They were veiled, but did not scrupulously conceal their faces as the eastern women generally do. They paint the ends of their fingers red, their lips blue, and their eyebrows and eyelashes black. They had large rings of gold or brass in their ears and nostrils, and appeared to be healthy and robust. The walls of the city are flanked by square towers, into which some ancient funeral monuments have been converted; but the walls are in most places level with the ground, and sometimes not to be traced. It is, however, probable, by their general direction, that they included the great temple, and are three miles in circumference. The Arabs showed a tract which was near ten miles in circumference, the soil of which was raised a little above the level of the desert: this, they said, was the extent of the old city; and that by digging in any part of its ruins were discovered.\n\nThese ruins consist of temples, palaces, and porticoes of Grecian architecture; and lie scattered over an extent of several miles. They were accidentally discovered by some English travellers from Aleppo somewhat more than a century ago. By far the most remarkable of them is the Temple of the Sun, of which the ruins are spread over a square of 220 yards. It was encompassed with a stately wall, built of large square stones, and adorned with pilasters within and without, to the number of 62 on a side. Within the court are the remains of two rows of very noble marble pillars 37 feet high, with their capitals of most exquisite workmanship. Of these only 58 remain entire; but there must have been many more, for they appear to have gone round the whole court, and to have supported a double piazza. The walks on that side of the piazza which is opposite to the front of the castle seem to have been the most spacious and beautiful. At each end of this line are two niches for statues, with their pedestals, borders, supports, and canopies, carved with the utmost propriety and elegance. The space within this inclosure, which is now filled with the dirty huts of the inhabitants, seems to have been an open court, in the middle of which stood the temple, encompassed with another row of pillars of a different order, and much taller, being 50 feet high; but of these only 16 only remain. The whole space contained within these pillars is 59 yards in length, and near 28 in breadth. The temple is no more than 33 yards in length, and 13 or 14 in breadth. It points north and south; and exactly into the middle of the building, on the west side, is a most magnificent entry, on the remains.\nThe Remains of the Great Temple of the Sun in Palmyra from the West.\nPalmyra. mains of which are some vines and clusters of grapes, carved in the most bold and masterly imitation of nature that can be conceived. Just over the door are discerned a pair of wings, which extend its whole breadth; the body to which they belonged is totally destroyed; and it cannot now certainly be known whether it was that of an eagle or a cherub, several representations of both being visible on other fragments of the building. It is observed of the windows of this building, which were not large, that they were narrower at the top than below. The north end of the building is adorned with the most curious fret-work and bas-relief; and in the middle there is a dome or cupola about ten feet diameter, which appears to have been either hewn out of the rock, or moulded to some composition which by time is grown equally hard. North of this place is an obelisk, consisting of seven large stones, besides its capital and the wreathed work about it. It is about 50 feet high; and, just above the pedestal, is 12 feet in circumference. There was probably a statue upon it, which the Turks, in their zeal against idolatry, destroyed. At about the distance of a quarter of a mile from this pillar, to the east and west, are two others, besides the fragment of a third; so that perhaps they were originally a continued row.\n\nAbout 150 paces from the middle obelisk, straight forward, is a magnificent entry to a piazza, which is 40 feet broad, and more than half a mile in length, inclosed with two rows of marble pillars 26 feet high, and eight or nine feet in compass. Of these there still remain 129; and, by a moderate computation, there could not originally have been less than 360. The upper end of the piazza was shut in by a row of pillars, standing somewhat closer than those on each side. A little to the left are the ruins of a stately building, which appears to have been a banqueting-house. It is built of better marble, and is finished with yet greater elegance, than the piazza. The pillars which supported it were of one entire stone, which is so strong, that one of them which is fallen down has received no injury. It measures 22 feet in length, and in compass 8 feet 9 inches. In the west side of the piazza are several apertures for gates into the court of the palace. Each of these was adorned with four porphyry pillars, not standing in a line with those of the wall, but placed by couples in the front of the gate facing the palace, two on each side. Two of these only remain entire, and but one standing in its place. They are 30 feet long and 9 in circumference. On the east side of the piazza stands a great number of marble pillars, some perfect, but the greater part mutilated. In one place 11 are ranged together in a square; the space which they inclose is paved with broad flat stones, but there are no remains of a roof. At a little distance are the remains of a small temple, which is also without a roof, and the walls are much defaced. Before the entry, which looks to the south, is a piazza supported by five pillars, two on each side of the door, and one at each end. The pedestals of those in front have been filled with inscriptions both in the Greek and Palmyrene languages, which are become totally illegible. Among these ruins are many sepulchres: they are ranged on each side of a hollow way, toward the north part of the city, and extend more than a mile. They are all square towers, four or five stories high. But though they are alike in form, yet they differ greatly in magnitude and splendour. The outside is of common stone, but the floors and partitions of each story are marble. There is a walk across the whole building, just in the middle; and the space on each hand is subdivided into six partitions by thick walls. The space between the partitions is wide enough to receive the largest corpse; and in the niches there are six or seven piled upon one another.\n\nMany inscriptions have been found at Palmyra, which have occupied much of the attention of the learned; and if anything certain could be derived from them, there is no doubt but they would tend very considerably to the elucidation of ancient history. See Barthelemy's Reflections on the Palmyrene Alphabet, published at Paris in 1753; and An Explication of the Inscriptions at Palmyra hitherto published, by John Swinton of Christ-church, Oxford. See also Phil. Trans. No. 217, and 218.; the first volume of the Ancient Universal History; and, above all, consult the Ruins of Palmyra, or Tadmor in the Desert, published by Mr R. Wood, who, with M. Bouvierie and Mr Dawkins, travelled thither in 1751. The result of their observations was published in 1753, in the form of an atlas. The ruins of this once mighty and celebrated city are represented in 57 copperplates, 16 by 12 inches, printed on imperial paper. They are admirably executed; the drawing is correct and masterly; and the engraving highly finished; nor can they fail to give satisfaction to those who are connoisseurs in the art, or to those who delight in the labours of antiquity.\n\nPalmyra was visited by Mr Bruce before his journey into Abyssinia; but, on account of the many publications concerning these celebrated ruins, he has declined saying much concerning them. He informs us, that, before he came in sight of the ruins, he ascended a hill of white gritty stone, in a very narrow winding road, such as is called a pass; but on getting up to the top his eyes were struck with the most stupendous sight which, he believes, ever mortal saw. The whole plain below, which is very extensive, was so covered with magnificent buildings, that they seemed to touch one another. All of them are finely proportioned, agreeably shaped, and composed of white stones, which at that distance appeared like marble. In taking a draught of these ruins, Mr Bruce divided the whole into five angular views, for which the situation of the place is very convenient. The columns are all uncovered to the very bases, the ground on which they are built being hard and solid. The views he took were upon large paper; some of the columns being represented a foot long, and some of the figures in the foreground of the Temple of the Sun (a magnificent building which stood at one end of the town) being near four inches. Before he left Palmyra he observed its latitude with a reflecting quadrant of Hadley; but as the instrument was out of order, he could not determine it exactly. In his opinion, however, $33^\\circ 58'$ is not far distant from truth. From such observations as he could make on the longitude, he concluded it to be $37^\\circ 9'$ east from Greenwich. Mr R. Wood makes the latitude $34^\\circ$ north.\n\nFrom Palmyra Mr Bruce proceeded to Baalbec, distant about 130 miles, where he found ruins still more magnificent. The interior part of the great temple...\nPalpable at this place, according to our author, surpasses anything he had seen at Palmyra, or anywhere else. \"All these views of Palmyra and Baalbec (says he) are now in the king's collection. They are the most magnificent offerings, in their line, that ever was made by one subject to his sovereign.\"—In the neighbourhood of Palmyra are some salt-marts; and to the adjacent country a trade is carried on in kelp from Tripoli in Syria. There are two Arab tribes, almost equally powerful; one of them, called Annecy, remarkable for the finest horses in the world. They possess the country to the south-west, at the back of Libanus, about Bozrah, and southward towards the borders of Arabia Petraea and Mount Horeb. The other tribe, named Mowalli, inhabit the plains east from Damascus, to the Euphrates, and north to near Aleppo. They are fewer in number than the Annecy, but much better soldiers; and their breed of horses not greatly inferior.\n\nRespecting the latitude and longitude there are still various opinions: that which appears to be nearest the truth is E.

Such he is described by the Greek and Roman poets; but he bore a higher character among the earliest Greeks, as well as among the Egyptians; from whom his worship was borrowed by that people. In Egypt he was known by the name of Mendes, which, according to Jablonki*, signifies fecundity. Hence his symbol was a living he-goat, the most salacious of all animals: \"Hircum Mendetum colunt rum Aegyptii, eo quod virtuti profligae ac genitiva, confractus est.\" Nam animal hoc coitus valde cupidum est.\" His principal temple was a magnificent building in a city of Lower Egypt, called after his name. It is well known (see Polytheism) that from dedicating certain animals to certain gods, the Egyptians proceeded to consider the animals themselves as actuated by the divinities to whom they were sacred. Hence the origin of brute worship. In the temple of Mendes was kept a he-goat, to whom sacrifices of a very monstrous kind were offered. Herodotus, speaking of the prefecture of Mendes, says†, \"Egyiis ἐν τῷ νομῷ τούτῳ Lib. 19, ἐν ἑκαστῷ τῶν τε πηγῶν γυμνοῖς τρέχουσι μυστήρια αποδείξειν. ch. 26. Τούτῳ εἰσι ἀπόδεξαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀποδείξεως. Our readers, learned and unlearned, will forgive us for not translating this passage, which contains, however, nothing that is not confirmed by the testimony of other writers; particularly of Plutarch, and Pindar as he is quoted by Strabo. The most wonderful circumstance of this monstrous sacrifice is, that it was made publicly in the presence of a great concourse of men! But to what divinity was it made? To a mere goat, or to some superior principle animating the goat? Doubtless to the latter; for it is said that the fair worshippers were of the first rank, and of unspotted fame; and that if they had borne a different character, the deity would not have accepted of their devotions.\n\nThe deity whom the Egyptians adored by the name of Mendes, was no other than the Soul of the Universe; for he was their most ancient god: and we are told by Plutarch‡, \"That they took the first God and the Universe for one and the same thing.\" Hence et Ophir. His name Παῦλος among the Greeks: not that either the Greeks or their masters in theology worshipped, as the first god, mere brute matter, but that spirit which they conceived to be coextensive with matter, and to animate all things, making them one. Thus Orpheus, who imported the Egyptian doctrine into Greece, declares that all things are one: and after him Parmenides, and other philosophers, taught, ὁμοίως το πάντων, that \"one is the universe;\" and that \"the universe is immovable.\" That the ancient Grecian Pan, or the Egyptian Mendes, was not the corporeal world, as senseless and inanimate, but the whole system of things, animated and eternal, appears further from the following testimony of Macrobius. \"Hunc deum Arcades colunt, appellantes τῷ τῶν ὑπὸ κυρίου, non sylvarum domi- num, sed universae substantiae materialis dominorem;\"—The Arcadians worship this god, calling him the lord...\nlord of Hyle; i.e., not the lord of the woods, but the lord of all material substance.\" In the same manner, Phanatus describes the Pan of the other Greeks, not as the mere corporeal world, but as the intellectual principle actuating it and presiding over it; and he adds, that \"Pan was feigned to be lascivious, because of the multitude of fpermatic reasons in the world, and the continual mixtures and generation of things.\"\n\nThe Egyptians, as we learn from Jablonki, had nearly the same notion with the Greeks of the spirit which they worshipped as the Soul of the Universe; only they gave to it both sexes. As the maker, govorner, and bountiful father of universal nature, they considered it as a male, whose symbol was the he-goat of Mendes; and as a female it was adored by the name of Isis, to whom the she-goat was consecrated, though not held in such veneration as the male. From this view of the Egyptian creed, the sacrifice which we have mentioned appears no longer unaccountable. It was made to a god, believed to be the universal source of fecundity, and to whom, from the well-known character of the animal, whom he was supposed to actuate, they had reason to believe it would be most acceptable.\n\nThe Greeks never worshipped their Pan by the emblem of a living goat; but they painted him with the lower parts of a goat, for a reason which shall be afterwards mentioned. How he came to degenerate among that people, from one of the Dii majorum gentium, or rather from the first principle of all things, to the rank of a daemon or demi-god, we cannot pretend to say; but that such was his fate, is certain; for under this last character mention is made both of his birth and his death.\n\nWhole son he was, is not agreed among them. Homer makes him the son of Mercury, and says he was called Pan from πάν, omne, because he charmed all the gods with his flute; others say that he was the son of Demogorgon, and first invented the organ, of seven unequal reeds, joined together in a particular manner: Having on a time fought with Cupid, that god in spite made him fall in love with the coy nymph Syrinx, who, flying from him to the banks of Ladon, a river of Arcadia, at the instant prayers of the Nymphs was turned into a reed, as her name in Greek signifies, which the god grasping instead of her, made a pipe of it, and for his music was adored by the Arcadians. The most common opinion was, that he was the son of Mercury and Penelope. But Nat. Comus, out of Duris Samias, makes his birth scandalous, by saying he was called πάν, because begot by all Penelope's suitors. He was painted half-man half-goat, having large goats horns, a chaplet of pine on his red face, a pleasant laughter, with the feet and tail of a goat; a motley skin covering his body, with a crooked stick in one hand and his pipe in the other. See him nicely described by Sil. Ital. 13. 326. et seq., a sight enough to fright women and children, yea, armed men too; for when Brennus the Gaul was about to pillage the temple of Apollo at Delphos, he by night struck such a terror into his army, that he quitted his sacrilegious design: hence Panic terrorizes. Yet, as homely as he was, he pleased the goddess Luna, turning himself easily into a white ram, Virgil, Georg. iii. 392. et deinceps; and the nymph Dryope also, almost putting off his divinity, and turning\n\nNeither was he displeasing to other nymphs, who are generally made dancing round about him to hear the charms of his pipe. The usual offerings made him were milk and honey, in shepherds wooden bowls; also they sacrificed to him a dog, the wolf's enemy; whence his usual epithet is λύκος; and whence also his priests were called Luperci.\n\nHis festival was celebrated on February 15th by the Romans, brought into Italy by Evander the Arcadian, and revived afterwards by Romulus, in memory of his preserver. He was also called by the Romans Iunus, ab incendo. Vid. Liv. i. 5. Macrob. Sat. i. 21. and Serv. in Virg. Aen. vi. 775. The ancients, by giving to many adjuncts and attributes to this idol as we have observed above, seem to have designed him for the symbol of the universe; his upper parts being human, because the upper part of the world is fair, beautiful, smiling, like his face; his horns symbolize the rays of the sun and of the moon; his red face, the splendor of the sky; the spotted skin wherewith he is clothed, the stars which bespangle the firmament; the roughness of his lower parts, beasts and vegetables; his goat's feet, the solidity of the earth; his pipe, compact of seven reeds, the seven planets, which they say make the harmony of the spheres; his crook, bending round at the top, the years circling in one another. Serv. Interpr.\n\nHaving said so much of Pan, both as a self-existent god and as a generated daemon, we shall conclude the article with some observations on Plutarch's account of the prodigy which happened at his death; for in the Pagan creed, daemons were not all believed immortal.—\"In the reign of Tiberius (says our author),* Lib. de certain persons on a voyage from Asia to Italy, and Gracilis, falling towards the evening by the Echinedes, were Defect. there becalmed, and heard a loud voice from the shore calling on one Thamus an Egyptian pilot whom they had on board. Thamus, as may be supposed, lifted with attention; and the voice, after repeating his name thrice, commanded him when he came to the Pelodes, to declare that the Great Pan was dead. The man, with the advice of his companions, resolved, that if they should have a quick gale off the Pelodes, he would pass by in silence; but that if they should be becalmed, he would perform what the voice had commanded. Adhering to this resolution, they soon arrived off the defined islands, and were immediately becalmed, there being neither breath of wind nor agitation of water. Upon this Thamus looking from the hinder part of the ship towards the land, pronounced with a loud voice: μέγας Πάν τεθνηκε, The Great Pan is dead! and was instantly answered from the shore by numberless howlings and lamentations.\"\n\nThis story, which has so much the air of imposture, has not only been admitted as truth by men of the first eminence for learning and acuteness, but has been applied to our Saviour, whose death (says Cudworth) the demons mourned not from love, but from a prefigure that it would put a period to the tyranny and domination which they had so long exercised over the souls and bodies of men. In support of this opinion, he quotes several passages of Scripture, such as, \"Now is the prince of this world judged;\" and, \"Having spoiled principalities and powers (by his death upon the cross), he triumphed over them in it.\" He affirms likewise, that \"Pan being taken for that reason...\"\nPan. son or understanding by which all things were made, and by which they are all governed, or for that divine wisdom which diffuseth itself through all things, is a name which might very well signify God manifested in the flesh.\"\n\nThe authority of Cudworth is great; but a groundless opinion has seldom been propped by weaker reasoning than he makes use of on this occasion. Plutarch indeed lays, and seems to believe, that this prodigy fell out during the reign of Tiberius; but as he mentions not the year of that reign, there is no evidence that it was at the crucifixion of our Saviour. The demons who inhabited the Ephesians knew what had been transacted at Jerusalem far distant from their islands; they knew the name of the pilot of a strange ship; they knew that the mariners of that ship had resolved to disobey their command, unless becalmed off the Pelodes; they had power over both the winds and waves at the Pelodes, and exerted that power to enforce obedience to their command; and yet these all-knowing and powerful beings were under the necessity of calling in the aid of a man to deliver a message to their companions, inhabiting a place to which the very same story affirms that their own power and knowledge reached. Should it be said that the demons were compelled by divine power thus publicly to make known to man Christ's triumph over the kingdom of darkness, we beg leave to ask why they were not likewise compelled to give him another name, since it is certain, that at the era of Tiberius, and long before, illiterate Pagans, such as common seamen must be supposed to have been, knew no other Pan than the fabled son of Penelope and Mercury?—Indeed, the other Pan, taken for that reason or understanding by which all things were made, could not possibly be the being here meant; for, erroneous as the Pagan system was, there is nothing in it to completely abjure as the death of the soul of the universe, the maker of all things: nor do we believe that any Pagan ever existed, who dreamed that such a death was possible.\n\nWhat then, it will be asked, are we to understand by this story? Plutarch was eminent for knowledge and integrity, and he relates it without expressing a doubt of its truth. He does so; but many a man of worth has been credulous; and though that was not his character, this prodigy may be accounted for by natural means. Germanicus was believed to have been poisoned, at least with the knowledge, if not by the command, of Tiberius; and there was nothing which the Romans so deeply deplored as the untimely death of that accomplished prince*. They fancied that his body was animated, not by a human soul, but by a superior demon; and they decreed to him statues, religious ceremonies, and even sacrifices. His widow was highly honoured, as having been nearly related to a divinity, and his children were adored as demi-gods. These facts being admitted, nothing appears to us more probable than the opinion of the learned Moshem†, who thinks that some shrewd statesman, in order to excite the popular fury against Tiberius to the highest pitch, invented this story, and bribed foreign mariners to spread it among the people, who would naturally believe, that by the great Pan was meant their favourite Germanicus. This hypothesis is at least countenanced by what Plutarch tells us of the anxiety of the emperor to discover what personage Panacea could be meant by the Pan whose death was announced to the seamen: he consulted the learned men of Rome, who, in order to restore peace to the city, declared that they understood it of none other than the son of Penelope and Mercury.\n\nPANACEA, among physicians, denotes an universal medicine, or a remedy for all diseases; a thing impossible to be obtained.\n\nPANADA, a diet consisting of bread boiled in water to the consistence of pulp, and sweetened with a little sugar.\n\nPANAMA, the capital city of the province of Darien in South America, where the treasures of gold and silver, and the other rich merchandises of Peru, are lodged in magazines till they are sent to Europe. W. Long. 82. 15. N. Lat. 8. 57.\n\nWhen Guzman first touched at this place in 1514, it consisted entirely of fishermen's huts. Orius d'Avila settled a colony here in a few years after, and in 1521 it was constituted a city by the emperor Charles V., with the proper privileges. In 1679 it was sacked and burnt by John Morgan, an English adventurer, who had the preceding year taken Porto Bello. This misfortune induced the inhabitants to remove the city to its present situation, distant about a league from the place where it stood before. For the greater security, the new city was inclosed by a free-stone wall, and the houses were built of stone and brick. Since that time several battlements have been added, and now there is always a complete garrison maintained, and the walls are mounted with large cannon. But, all these precautions could not save this city from another misfortune; it was entirely consumed by fire in the year 1737. After this accident it was again rebuilt, in the manner as it now stands, with neat elegant houses, but not magnificent. The inhabitants are rather independent in their fortunes than rich; there are few of them opulent, and scarce any in a state of poverty. As to the harbour, it is convenient, and well secured against storms by a number of surrounding islands, and is capable of containing the largest fleets. Here the royal audience is seated, at which the governor of Panama resides; for which reason this city is commonly deemed the capital of the province.\n\nThis place, a little while after it was founded, became the capital of the kingdom of Terra Firma. Some hopes were at first entertained from the three provinces of Panama, Darien, and Veragua, which composed it; but this prosperity vanished instantaneously. The labours of Darien recovered their independence; and the mines of the two other provinces were found to be neither sufficiently abundant, nor of an alloy good enough to make it worth while to work them. Five or six small boroughs, in which are seen some Europeans quite naked, and a very small number of Indians who have come to reside there, form the whole of this state, which the Spaniards are not ashamed of honouring with the great name of kingdom. It is in general barren and unwholesome, and contributes nothing to trade but pearls.\n\nThe pearl fishery is carried on in the islands of the gulf. The greatest part of the inhabitants employ such of their negroes in it as are good swimmers. These slaves plunge and re-plunge in the sea in search of\nPanama of pearls, till this exercise has exhausted their strength or their spirits.\n\nEvery negro is obliged to deliver a certain number of oysters. Those in which there are no pearls, or in which the pearl is not entirely formed, are not reckoned. What he is able to find beyond the stipulated obligation, is considered as his indisputable property; he may sell it to whom he pleases; but commonly he cedes it to his master at a moderate price.\n\nSea monsters, which abound more about the islands where pearls are found than on the neighbouring coasts, render this fishing dangerous. Some of these devour the divers in an instant. The mantis fish, which derives its name from its figure, surrounds them, rolls them under its body, and suffocates them. In order to defend themselves against such enemies, every diver is armed with a poniard; the moment he perceives any of those voracious fish, he attacks them with precaution, wounds them, and drives them away. Notwithstanding this, there are always some fishermen destroyed and a great number crippled.\n\nThe pearls of Panama are commonly of a very fine water. Some of them are even remarkable for their size and figure; they were formerly sold in Europe. Since art has imitated them, and the passion for diamonds has entirely superseded or prodigiously diminished the use of them, they have found a new market more advantageous than the first. They are carried to Peru, where they are in great estimation.\n\nThis branch of trade has, however, infinitely less contributed to give reputation to Panama, than the advantage which it hath long enjoyed of being the mart of all the productions of the country of the Incas that are destined for the old world. These riches, which are brought hither by a small fleet, were carried, some on mules, others by the river Chagre, to Porto Bello, that is situated on the northern coast of the isthmus which separates the two seas. See Darien.\n\nPANARI, one of the Lipari islands, lying in the Tuscan sea. It is only five miles in circumference, and the soil is barren. E. Long. 15°. N. Lat. 39°.\n\nPANARO, a river of Italy, which rises in the Apennines, crosses the valley of Frignano, and running on the confines of the Modene and Bolognese, waters Fenal, and falls into the Po at Bondeno, ten miles above Ferrara.\n\nPANATHENÆA, παναθηναία, in Grecian antiquity, an ancient Athenian festival, in honour of Minerva the protectress of Athens, and called Athenea. Harpocratius and Suidas refer the institution of this festival to Erichthonius IV. king of Athens, who lived before Theseus. Theodoret alone says the feast was established by Orpheus. Be this as it will, till Theseus it was never a particular feast of the city of Athens, and was called simply Athenea: but that prince, uniting all the people of Attica into one republic, they afterwards all assisted at the feast; whence the name Panathenaea, i.e. the feast of all Attica. In effect all Attica was present; and each people sent a bullock for the sacrifices, and for the entertainment of the vast multitude of people assembled.\n\nThere were two festivals under this denomination, the greater and the lesser. The greater panathenaea were exhibited every five years; the lesser every three, or, according to some writers, annually. Though the celebration of neither, at first, employed more than one day; yet in after-times they were protracted for the space of many days, and solemnized with greater preparations and magnificence than at their first institution.\n\nThe ceremonies were the same in the great and the little panathenaea; excepting for a banner, wherein the actions of the goddesses were represented in embroidery, performed by maids, with the names of those who had distinguished themselves in the service of the republic; which was only borne at the greater.\n\nPrizes were established there for three different kinds of combat: the first consisted of foot and horse races; the second, of athletic exercises; and the third, of poetical and musical contests. These last are said to have been instituted by Pericles. Singers of the first class, accompanied by performers on the flute and cithara, exercised their talents here upon subjects prescribed by the directors of these exhibitions.\n\nThe following is the order observed in this festival, Anacharsis, according to M. Barthelemy, who quotes numerous authorities on the occasion: \"The inhabitants of the different towns of Attica thronged to the capital, leading with them a great number of victims destined for sacrifices to the goddess. In the first morning were the horse-races, in which the sons of the first citizens of Athens contended for the honour of the victory. In the stadium were other young men struggling for the prize at wrestling, and different exercises of the body; and in the odeum were several musicians engaged in gentler and less rigorous contests. Some executed pieces on the flute or cithara; others sang, and accompanied their voices with one of these instruments. The subject proposed to them was the eulogium of Harmodius, Aristogiton, and Thrasybulus, who had rescued the republic from the yoke of the tyrants by which it was oppressed; for, among the Athenians, public institutions are so many monuments for the citizens who have served the state, and lessons for those who are called upon to render it service. A crown of olive, and a vessel filled with oil, were the prizes bestowed upon the victors. Crowns were afterwards conferred on individuals, who appeared to the people to have merited that mark of honour by their zeal in the service of their country.\n\n\"At the Ceramicus passed a procession, formed without the walls, and which began at that place to file off. It was composed of different classes of citizens crowned with chaplets of flowers, and remarkable for their personal beauty. Among the number were old men of a majestic and venerable appearance, bearing branches of olive; middle-aged men, who, armed with lances and with bucklers, seemed only to repulse war; youth from 18 to 20, who sang hymns in honour of the goddess; beautiful boys, clad in a simple tunic, adorned only with their native graces; and, lastly, girls, who were of the first families in Athens, and whose features, shape, and deportment, attracted every eye. With their hands they held baskets on their heads, which, under a rich veil, contained sacred utensils, cakes, and every thing necessary for the sacrifices. Female attendants, who followed them, with one hand held over them an umbrella, and carried in the other a folding chair. This is a species of servitude imposed on the daughters of all foreigners settled at Athens: a servitude they share in common with their fathers and mothers, who likewise carried on their shoulders vessels filled with water and honey.\"\nhoney, for the purpose of libations. They were followed by eight musicians; four of whom played on the flute and four on the lyre. After them came rhapsodists singing the poems of Homer; and dancers armed at all points, who, attacking each other at intervals, represented, to the sound of the flute, the battle of Minerva with the Titans. Next came a ship that appeared to glide over the ground by the power of the wind, and the efforts of a great number of rowers, but which really was put in motion by concealed machinery. The vessel had a sail of light stuff, on which young girls had represented in embroidery the victory of Minerva over the Titans. On it also they had depicted, by order of the government, some heroes whose illustrious deeds had merited to be celebrated with those of the gods. This procession marched on with solemn steps, under the direction of several magistrates; and traversed the most frequented quarter of the city amidst a crowd of spectators, most of whom were placed on scaffolds erected for the occasion. When it had reached the temple of the Pythian Apollo, the sail of the ship was taken down and carried to the citadel, where it was deposited in the temple of Minerva.\n\n\"In the evening, at the academy, was the torch race. The course is only six or seven stadium in length. It extends from the altar of Prometheus, which is at the gate of this garden, to the walls of the city. Several young men are stationed in this interval at equal distances. When the shouts of the multitude have given the signal, the first lights his flambeau at the altar, and, running with it, hands it to the second, who transmits it in the same manner to the third, and so successively. He who suffers it to be extinguished can no more enter the lists; and they who slacken their pace are exposed to the ridicule, and even blows, of the populace. To gain the prize, it is necessary to have passed through the different stations with success. This trial of skill was frequently repeated, and is diversified according to the nature of the festivals.\n\n\"The candidates who had been crowned at the different exercises invited their friends to supper. Sumptuous repasts were given in the prytaneum and other public places, which lasted till the following day. The people among whom the immolated victims were distributed spread tables on every side, and gave a loofe to their lively and tumultuous mirth.\"\n\nPANAX, Ginseng; a genus of plants belonging to the polygamy class. See Botany and Materia Medica Index.\n\nPANAY, an island of Asia, and one of the Philippines, lying between those of Paragua and Negro. It is 250 miles in circumference, and is the most populous and fertile of them all. It is watered by a great number of rivers and brooks, and produces a great quantity of rice. Its shape is triangular. The names of its principal capes are Potol, Nafo, and Bulacabi. The coast from Bulacabi to Potol lies east and west; from Potol to Nafo, north and south; from Bulacabi to Iloilo, another cape, less than the great ones, is also north and south; from Iloilo to Cape Nafo, east and west. The middle of the island is in the latitude of ten degrees. On the north side, almost in the middle between the two capes of Potol and Bulacabi, the famous river Panay falls into the sea; and the mouth of the harbour is covered by a small island called Lutaya, in which port the Spaniards had a safe retreat before they discovered and conquered Manilla and Gavite. The fertility of Panay is caused by the many rivers that water it, for there is no travelling a league without meeting a river; but more particularly by the Panay, which gives its name to the island, and runs a course of 40 leagues. The island, for the better administering of justice, is divided into jurisdictions: the first, called Panay, contains all that lies between Cape Potol and Bulacabi; the rest of the island is subject to the alcayde of Otton, who resides at Iloilo, a point of land running out into the sea, on the fourth side, between the two rivers of Tig Bavan and Jaro, and, with the island Imaras, forms a strait not above half a league over, or rather an open harbour. On this point the governor Don Gonzalez Ronquillo caused a fort to be built in the year 1681. The island contains about 16,362 tributary Indians, partly belonging to the king and partly to particular encomenderos or lords; but they all pay in rice, the island producing 100,000 bushels, Spanish measure, and but little other grain. The inhabitants are stout, lusty, and industrious farmers, and expert hunters, the country being full of wild boars and deer. The women make cloth of several colours. There are in the island 14 parishes, belonging to the fathers of the order of St Augustin, three benefices of secular priests, and formerly one college of the society of Jesus, where they administer the sacraments to the garrison of Iloilo. Besides the tributary Indians, there are here those blacks the Spaniards call Negrillos, who were the first inhabitants of the island, and afterwards driven into the thick woods by the Bifayas who conquered it. Their hair is not so stiff curled, nor are they so stout and strong as the Guinea blacks. They live in the most uncouth parts of the mountains with their wives and children, all naked like beasts. They are so swift that they often overtake wild boars and deer. They fly about the dead beat as long as it lasts; for they have no other subsistence but what they acquire with their bow and arrows. They fly from the Spaniards, not so much through hatred as from fear. Among the islands about Panay lies Imaras, opposite to Iloilo, and about a quarter of a league distant. It is long and low, ten leagues in compass and three in length, the soil fertile, abounding in farfaparilla, and exceeding good water. On the mountains there are wild boars, deer, and good timber. It has also in it the port of St Anne, three leagues from Iloilo.\n\nPANCARPUS, in Roman antiquity, a kind of show which the Roman emperors frequently exhibited to the people. The word is formed from the Greek παν, all, and καρπος, fruit. Whence the name was also given by the Athenians to a sacrifice wherein all kinds of fruits were offered. In this spectacle, the circus being all set over with large trees, represented a forest, into which the beasts being let from the dens under ground, the people, at a sign given by the emperor, pursued, shot, and killed all they could lay hold of, which they afterwards carried away, to regale upon at home. The beasts usually given on these occasions were boars, deer, oxen, and sheep.\n\nCafaubon, Cujas, Pithou, &c. make the pancarpus and fylva the same thing; Salmasius will have them different. The fylva, according to him, was such a diversion as that above described; but the pancarpus a combat, wherein robust people, hired for that purpose, fought\nPANCRAS fought with wild beasts: which opinion he confirms from Caius, Justinian, Claudian, Firmicus, Manilius, and Caffiodorus.\n\nPANCRAS, a town of England, in the county of Middlesex, on the north-west side of London, and in the highway to Kentish town. Its church is one of the prebends of St Paul's, of which cathedral some call it the mother, it being thought to be as old as that church even in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when it is represented as weather-beaten and standing alone, without any company, though it had formerly many buildings about it. A veterinary college was established here in 1791, for the improvement of farriery, and the treatment of cattle in general.\n\nPANCRATIUM (compounded of πᾶν, all, and νικάω, I overcome), among the ancients, a kind of intermixed exercise, consisting of the lucta or wrestling, and the boxing or pugilate; but it differs in this, that as the athletes are not to seize the body, their hands are not armed with gauntlets, and give less dangerous blows.\n\nThe pancretium was the third gymnastic exercise, and was not introduced till long after the others. The people who were engaged in these exercises were called pancratiache; which name was also given to such as did not confine themselves to one exercise, but succeeded in several different ones.\n\nBartholomew, in his Travels of Anacharsis, gives us a short account of one of those at which he supposes him to have been present, in these words: \"The action was soon terminated: a Sicilian named Sybratus, a champion celebrated for the number of prizes he had won, and the strength and skill which had procured them, had arrived the preceding day. The greater part of the combatants yielded up all pretensions to the crown as soon as he appeared, and the others on the first trial; for in those preliminary essays, in which the athlete try their strength by taking each other's hands, he squeezed and twisted the fingers of his adversaries with such violence as instantly to decide the victory in his favour.\"\n\nPANCREAS. See Anatomy Index.\n\nPANDA, in Mythology, a goddess who was invoked and honoured as the protectress of travellers and navigators. The goddess of peace was also called Pandar, because she opened the gates of cities which were shut in time of war. According to Varro, Panda is a surname of Ceres, derived à pane dando, because she gave bread to mankind.\n\nPANDATARIA (Suetonius, Pliny, Strabo); PANDATERIA (Mela, Tacitus): An island in the Tuscan sea: a place of banishment for the more illustrious exiles. Hither Julia, the daughter of Augustus, was banished for her incontinence. To this island Tiberius banished Agrippina, his daughter-in-law (Suetonius.) It was the place of confinement of Octavia the daughter of Clodius, married to Nero; a flight that affected every eye (Tacitus). Now Santa Maria, situated between Pontia and Ischia (Holstenius).\n\nPANDECTS, PANDECTAE, in jurisprudence, the digest or collection, made by Justinian's order, of 534 decisions or judgements of the ancient lawyers, on so many questions occurring in the civil law; to which that emperor gave the force and authority of law, by the epistle prefixed to them.—The word is Greek, Πανδεκτα, compounded of πᾶν, \"all,\" and δικαιο, capio, \"I take;\" Pandects i.e. a compilation, or a book containing all things. Though others, as Battoli, will have it formed from πᾶν, and δικαιο; as if these books contained the whole doctrine of the civil law.\n\nThe Pandects consist of 50 books, and make the first part of the body of the civil law.\n\nThey were denoted by two πᾶν; but the copyists taking those πᾶν for ἀπό, the custom arose of quoting them by ἀπό:\n\nIn the year 1137, the Pandects of Justinian, which had been brought by an Anatolian merchant from the east, fell into the hands of the Pisans. Angelus Politianus believes this copy to be that which had been compiled by order of the emperor. However that be, it is certain that all other copies are taken from it, as being the most ancient. The Pisans having obtained their request from the emperor, carried the volumes to Pisa, and for near three centuries they were known by the name of the Pandecta Pisanæ. But, about the year 1416, Pisa being taken by the Florentines, they were transported from thence to Florence, where they are now preserved in the library of the Medici, and known by the name of the Pandecta Florentinae. Some authors allege, that Lotharius ordained by an edict that the Pandects should be publicly read and explained at Bologna, and pleaded in the tribunals; but Corringius and Lindenbrogius fully refute their opinion.\n\nPapies extends the denomination of Pandects to the Old and New Testament.\n\nThere are also Pandecta Medicine, \"Pandects of Medicine;\" a kind of dictionary of things relating to medicine, compiled by Mat. Sylvaticus of Mantua, who lived about the year 1297. Leuchavius has published Pandects of Turkey; and Bishop Beveridge, Pandecta canonum.\n\nPANDICULATION, a stretching; or that violent and extensive motion of the solids, which usually accompanies the act of yawning.\n\nPANDORA, in fabulous history, a woman formed by Prometheus, to whom each of the gods gave some perfection. Venus bestowed upon her beauty; Pallas, wisdom; Juno, riches; Apollo, music; and Mercury, eloquence: but Jupiter being displeased at Prometheus for having stolen fire from heaven to animate the maids he had formed, gave Pandora a box, which was ordered not to open; and then sent her to the earth with this box, in which were enclosed age, diseases, pestilence, war, famine, envy, discord, and all the evils and vices that could afflict mankind. This fatal box was opened by Epimetheus, Prometheus's brother, when instantly all the diseases and mischiefs with which it was filled spread over the earth, and Hope only remained at the bottom. Herodotus says she was the first woman.\n\nPANDOURS, are Hungarian infantry: they wear a loose garment fixed tight to their bodies by a girdle, with great sleeves, and large breeches hanging down to their ankles. They use fire-arms, and are excellent marksmen: they have also a kind of sabre near four feet long, which they use with great dexterity.\n\nPANDOSIA (Livy, Justin, Strabo), an inland town of the Brutii, and a place of strength on the river Acheron, where Alexander of Epirus, deceived by the oracle of Dodona, met his fate and perished. Now Mendicino (Holstenius). Another of Epirus (Strabo) situated...\nPandura situated on the river Acheron (Livy); which Alexander of Epirus was advised to avoid as fatal, but which he met with in Italy. This last is said to have been the residence of the Oenotrian kings (Strabo).\n\nPANDURA, or PANDORON, a musical instrument, used among the ancients, resembling the lute. The word is said to be formed from the Greek πάνδορος and δόρος, i.e., \"all gifts, all sorts of gifts.\" Hidore derives the name from its inventor Pandoros; others from Pan, to whom they attribute its invention, as well as that of the flute. It has the same number of strings with the lute; but they are of brass, and of consequence give a more agreeable sound than those of the lute. Its frets are of copper, like those of the citole; its back is flat, like that of the guitar; and the rims of its table, as well as its ribs, are cut in semicircles. Du Cange observes, that Varro, Hidore, and others of the ancients, mention it as having only three strings; whence it is sometimes also spoken of under the denomination τριχοδόρος, trichordum.\n\nPANEAS (Pliny, Josephus): the apparent spring from which the Jordan rises, on the extremity of the west side of the Trachonitis (Pliny).\n\nPANEAS (Coins, Pliny, Josephus), the name of a district adjoining to the spring Paneas, with a cognominal town, either enlarged and adorned, or originally built, by Philip son of Herod, and called Caesarea by Josephus, and in St Matthew, Caesarea of Philip; with a temple erected to Augustus his benefactor, who conferred the Trachonitis upon him (Coin). It was afterwards called Neronias, in honour of Nero (Josephus).\n\nPANEGYRIC, an oration in praise of some extraordinary thing, person, or virtue.\n\nThe name is Greek, πανεγυρίς; formed of πᾶν, \"all,\" and εὐγένεια, \"I assemble;\" because anciently held in public and solemn assemblies of the Greeks, either at their games, their feasts, fairs, or religious meetings.\n\nTo make their panegyrics the more solemn, the Greeks used to begin with the praises of the deity in whose honour the games, &c. were celebrated; then they descended to the praise of the people or country where they were celebrated; then to the princes or magistrates who presided at them; and at length to the champions, especially the conquerors, who had gained the prizes in them.\n\nPANEGYRICUM, in church history, an ecclesiastical book, used by the Greek church, containing the panegyrical orations of various authors, on the solemnities of Jesus Christ and the saints. It is found in MS. in most churches, but it is not the same in all; each church having its particular saints; and the compilers of this kind of books usually suited their collections to the taste of their own devotion. They are disposed according to the order of the months, and frequently consist of 12 volumes, answering to the 12 months of the year.\n\nAmong the principal authors of this work are Athanasius, Cyril, Basil, Chrysostom, &c.\n\nPANEL (Panella, Panelium), according to Sir Edward Coke, denotes \"a little part;\" but the learned Spelman says, that it signifies schedula vel pagina, \"a schedule or roll;\" as a panel of parchment, or a counterpane of an indenture; but it is used more particularly for a schedule or roll, containing the names of such jurors as the sheriff returns to pass upon any trial. And the impounding a jury is the entering their names in a panel or little schedule of parchment.\n\nPanel, in Scots Law, signifies the prisoner at the bar, or person who takes his trial before the court of justiciary for some crime.\n\nPANGOLIN, a species of the manis peculiar to Hindoostan. See MANIS, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nPANIC, denotes an ill-grounded terror or fright. Polyenus says, it originates from Pan, one of the captains of Bacchus, who with a few men put a numerous enemy to rout, by a noise which his followers raised in a rocky valley, favoured with a great number of echoes. This stratagem making their number appear far greater than it was, the enemy quitted a very commodious encampment, and fled. Hence all ill-grounded fears have been called panic, or panic fears; and it was this that gave occasion to the fable of the nymph Echo's being beloved by the god Pan. Others derive the origin of it hence: that in the wars of the Titans against the gods, Pan was the first who struck terror into the hearts of the giants. Theon on Aratus says, he did it by the means of a sea shell, which served him for a trumpet, whereof he was the inventor.\n\nPANICLE, in Botany, denotes a soft woolly beard, on which the seeds of some plants hang pendulous; as in millet, reeds, and hay.\n\nPANICUM, a genus of plants belonging to the triandra clas. See BOTANY Index.\n\nPANINI, PAOLO, a painter of perspective and architecture. He was born at Placentia in 1691, with a most happy genius to painting, which he cultivated by studying at Rome, where he designed every vestige of ancient magnificence, the ruins of superb Roman edifices, cenotaphs, columns, baths, arches, and obelisks, as also some of the most entire buildings, the ornaments of modern Rome.\n\nHe studied the works of Ghisolfi with peculiar pleasure; he formed his taste, style, and manner, by the compositions of that esteemed artist; and his strongest ambition was to imitate him; so that he soon became eminent in that style beyond all his contemporaries. His composition is rich; the truth of his perspective is critically exact; and his paintings are universally esteemed for the grandeur of the architecture, for the clearness of his colouring, for the beautiful figures which he generally introduced, and also for the elegant taste with which he disposed them. He always designed them correctly, and set them off with suitable attitudes and expression.\n\nHowever, this description of his merit must be supposed to allude to his early and prime performances; for in his latter time, his pictures were distinguishable by a free and broad touch, but they are feeble in their colouring and effect. At all times, indeed, he was too apt to design his figures rather too large for the architecture, which diminished the grandeur of the most magnificent parts of his composition, and was quite contrary to the practice of Ghisolfi; whose works must perpetually afford a pleasing deception to the eye, by the perspective proportions observed between the figures, buildings, and distances.\n\nAt Rivoli, a pleasure house belonging to the king of Sardinia, there are several of Panini's paintings, which are views of that fine retreat and its environs. They are beautifully coloured, well handled, and with a touch full\nPANIONIA, in antiquity, a festival celebrated in honour of Neptune by a concourse of people from all the cities of Ionia. It is remarkable in this festival, that if the bull offered in sacrifice happened to bellow, it was accounted an omen of divine favour; because that sound was thought to be acceptable to Neptune.\n\nPANNARIA, one of the Lipari islands. See Lipara and Lipari.—The ancients called it Thermifa, from the hot waters which they found in it. It may be about eight or nine miles in circumference. It bears wheat, and grapes from which the inhabitants make wine. Pannaria, like the other adjacent islands, appears to be a volcano; its original having been destroyed by continued eruptions. It is now no longer of a conical figure. It contains about 100 inhabitants, reckoning every foul, men, women, and children. It is, like Stromboli, governed by a curate, who depends on the priest of the parish of St Joseph in Lipari; and when any couple in the island determine to marry, they must cross the sea to Lipari to receive the nuptial benediction in the parish of St Joseph, or pay a sum for a licence to empower the curate of Pannaria to perform the ceremony. All the other adjoining islands are subject to the same regulation.\n\nThe inhabitants of Pannaria live by fishing, and by taking small quantities of game on this and the little contiguous islands. They bring up and tame those birds known by the name of gulls, which are seen in tempestuous weather flying near the surface of the sea. They are here called coraggio. The body of the bird and the tips of its wings are white; but the head, the tail, and the rest of the wings, are grey: they are of the size of Indian hens; their wings are prodigiously large: they have their nests on the steep inaccessible cliffs of the several islands. When the islanders bring these birds up tame, they feed them with fish, which, though of such size that you would think it impossible for their stomachs to receive them, they eagerly stretch their necks and swallow rapaciously. These birds are thus brought up to be as tame as pullets or pigeons; and such an attachment do they often acquire to the places in which they are reared, that some of them have been known to return to these islands after being conveyed to Messina and Messina.\n\nOn the summit of a hill in this island, which projects over the sea, the inhabitants pretend to show a castle and an inscription. But their castle is only an elevated peak of the rock, which nature seems to have prepared as a retreat for birds. It consists of puzzold; and has been actually formed by the action of winds and rains, for a long course of time, into a fantastic figure, which may appear, when carelessly viewed from a distance by an undistinguishing eye, the remains of some ancient structure. The good people of the island, not being able to judge of it otherwise than from appearance, are persuaded, that it can be nothing but a castle, which must have been reared for the defence of the island against the Turks and the corsairs of Barbary. These they consider as the most dreadful scourge with which mankind can possibly be afflicted, and fear them much more than the eruptions of the volcano. When they feel their island shaken, they embark with all their wealth, which a single floop easily contains; and on board they are safe from both the shaking of the earth and the eruptions of the lava, but not from an hostile fleet.\n\nIn this island there appear various remains of ancient buildings, but very ruinous and very scanty. In ploughing the fields, many remains of sepulchres, in different modes of construction, are found; some of rough stones, tiles, or bricks; others consisting each of a single stone. Vases of various sorts and sizes are also said to have been found in the same fields, utensils of different kinds, money, chains, and medals of lead. But none of these relics of antiquity have been preserved: the good people who found them were ignorant of their value, and therefore neglected them as trifles. In places along the shore of the island, where the sea appears to have encroached, there are some hewn stones to be seen: they seem to be remains of walls, which must have been very strong and of elegant architecture. In other places farther distant from the shore, there likewise appear fragments of walls sunk in the ground, and apparently overwhelmed with mud, which the winds and rains have brought down from the mountain above. These remains show, that Pannaria, either under the Greeks, or in that period when all the elements were taxed for the gratification of Roman luxury, must have been adorned with superb buildings, as well as the adjacent islands of Lipari, Stromboli, and Basiluzzo.\n\nPANELLS of a SADDLE, are two cushions or bolsters, filled with cows, deer, or horses hair, and placed under the saddle, on each side, to prevent the bows and bands from galling the horse.\n\nPANNICULUS carnosus, in Comparative Anatomy, a robust flethy tunic, situated in beads between the skin and the fat; by means of which they can move their skin in whole or in part.

Long. 12° 25'. N. Lat. 36° 55'.\n\nPantænus, a Stoic philosopher, born in Sicily (though some have erroneously supposed him to be a Hebrew) about the beginning of the reign of Commodus. He presided over the celebrated school of Alexandria, where, from the time of St Mark, the founder of that church, they had always a divine that was eminent for his learning and piety, to explain the Holy Scriptures, and to instruct them in human learning. This employment he was obliged to leave; for when the Indians required of Demetrius bishop of Alexandria to send them one to instruct them in Christianity, he sent Pantænus, who undertook the mission with joy, and behaved himself very properly in it. We are told, that the Indians had been tinctured with Christianity by St Bartholomew the apostle; and that Pantænus met with the Hebrew original of St Matthew's gospel, which the apostle had left there. St Jerome says that Pantænus brought it with him; and that it was, in his time, preserved in the library of Alexandria. But we suspect St Jerome to be mistaken in this respect. When Pantænus returned to Alexandria, he reassumed the government of the school of that city, which, it is probable, he had, during his absence, committed to the care of St Clement, a presbyter of Alexandria. He explained the Scriptures publicly, under the reign of Severus Antoninus Caracalla; and was, in St Jerome's opinion, more serviceable to the church by his discourses than by his writings. He published some commentaries upon the Bible, which are lost. \"That the prophets often express themselves in indifferent terms, and that they make use of the present time instead of the past and future,\" is a rule of Pantænus, which has been followed by all succeeding interpreters. Theodorus has related this rule; but he speaks of it as if Pantænus had rather said than written it.\n\nWe may have some notion of Pantænus's manner of explaining the Scriptures by the like performances of St Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and others who were brought up in that school.\n\nPantaloons, a sort of garment consisting of breeches and stockings of one piece; said to have been first introduced by the Venetians.\n\nPantaloons, on the theatre, is a buffoon or masked person, who performs high and grotesque dances, and shows violent and extravagant postures and airs. The word is likewise used for the habit or dress these buffoons usually wear; which is made precisely to the form of their body, and all of a piece from head to foot.\n\nAnd hence those who wear a habit of this kind, for convenience, under their other clothes, are called pantaloons of Venice.\n\nPanthéa, in antiquity, were single statues, composed of the figures, or symbols, of several different divinities together. Father Joubert, who calls them panthees, and who has remarked them sometimes on medals, says their heads are most commonly adorned with the symbols or attributes belonging to several gods. An instance of this appears in a medal of Antoninus Pius; which represents Serapis by the bull he bears; the Sun by the crown of rays; Jupiter Annon by the ram's horns; Pluto by the large beard; and Æsculapius by the serpent twisted in his hand. M. Baudelot, in a dissertation on the Lares, observes, that the panthea had their origin from the superstition of those, who, taking several gods for the protectors of their houses, united them all in the same statue, by adorning it with the several symbols proper to each of these deities.\n\nPanthéism, a philosophical species of idolatry leading to atheism, in which the universe was considered as the supreme God. Who was the inventor of this absurd system, is, perhaps, not known; but it was of early origin, and differently modified by different philosophers. Some held the universe to be one immense animal, of which the incorporeal soul was properly their God, and the heavens and earth the body of that God; whilst others held but one substance, partly active and partly passive; and therefore looked upon the visible universe as the only Nomen. The earliest Grecian Panthéist of whom we read was Orpheus, who called the world the body of God, and its several parts his members, making the whole universe one divine animal.\n\nAccording to Cudworth, Orpheus and his followers believed in the immaterial soul of the world; therein agreeing with Aristotle, who certainly held that God and matter are coeternal; and that there is some such union between them as subsists between the souls and bodies of men. See Metaphysics, No. 264.\n\nIn the ancient Orphic theology, we are taught, that \"this universe, and all things belonging to it, were made within God; that all things are contained together in the womb of God; that God is the head and middle of all things; that he is the basis of the earth and heaven; that he is the depth of the sea, the air we breathe, the force of the untamable fires; that he is the sun, moon, and stars; that there is one divine body; for,\n\nΠάντα γὰρ ἐν μεγάλῳ τῷ ἀπὸ συμβολῆς κόσμῳ\n\n\"all these things lie in the great body of God.\"—But further, to prove that the most ancient Greek philosophers resolved all things into God, and made God all, we shall cite a most remarkable passage from Plutarch's Delect of Oracles. \"Whereas there are two causes of all generations, the divine and the human, the most ancient theologers and poets attended only to the more excellent of these two; resolving all things into God, and pronouncing this of them universally;\n\nΖωὴν ἀρχήν, Ζωὴν μέσον, Διὸς δ' ἐκ πᾶσα πρᾶξις\n\n'that God is both the beginning and middle, and that all things are out of God;' inasmuch, that they had no regard\nPantheon. regard at all to the other natural and necessary causes of things; but on the contrary, their juniors, who were called naturalists, deviating from this most excellent and divine principle, placed all in bodies, their passions, collisions, mutations, and commixtures.\"\n\nThat by the most ancient theologers here mentioned, Plutarch meant Orpheus and his immediate followers, is plain from the Orphic verse by which he proves their antiquity. By their juniors, whom he calls naturalists, he could mean no other than the first Grecian philosophers, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Hippo, who were followed by the atheistical atomists, Leucippus, Democritus, Protagoras, and Epicurus. But with respect to the universe being God, and all things divine and human being modifications of mere matter, the flores undoubtedly agreed with Anaximander and his followers; for the school of Zeno held but one subsistence. See Metaphysics, No 265. This impious doctrine, that all things are God, and that there is but one subsistence, was revived in modern times by Spinoza, an apostate Jew. As we shall give a life of him and a view of his principles, we must refer the reader for a fuller account of Pantheism to Spinoza. See also Pan.\n\nPANTHEON, a beautiful edifice at Rome, anciently a temple, dedicated to all the gods; but now converted into a church, and dedicated to the Virgin and all the martyrs.\n\nThis edifice is generally thought to have been built by Agrippa son-in-law to Augustus, because it has the following inscription on the frieze of the portico.\n\nM. AGRIPPA L. F. COS. TERTIUM FECIT.\n\nSeveral antiquarians and artists, however, have supposed that the pantheon existed in the times of the commonwealth; and that it was only embellished by Agrippa, who added the portico. Be this as it will, however, the pantheon, when perfected by Agrippa, was an exceedingly magnificent building; the form of whose body is round or cylindrical, and its roof or dome is spherical: it is 144 feet diameter within; and the height of it, from the pavement to the grand aperture on its top, through which it receives the light, is just as much. It is of the Corinthian order. The inner circumference is divided into seven grand niches, wrought in the thickness of the wall: six of which are flat at the top; but the seventh, opposite to the entrance, is arched. Before each niche are two columns of antique yellow marble fluted, and of one entire block, making in all 14, the finest in Rome. The whole wall of the temple, as high as the grand cornice inclusive, is caled with divers sorts of precious marble in compartments. The frieze is entirely of porphyry. Above the grand cornice arises an attic, in which were wrought, at equal distances, 14 oblong square niches: between each niche were four marble pilasters, and between the pilasters marble tables of various kinds. This attic had a complete entablature; but the cornice projected less than that of the grand order below. Immediately from the cornice springs the spherical roof, divided by bands, which cross each other like the meridians and parallels of an artificial terrestrial globe. The spaces between the bands decrease in size as they approach the top of the roof; to which, however, they do not reach, there being a considerable plain space between them and the great opening. That so bold a roof might be as light as possible, the architect formed the substance of the spaces Pantheon, between the bands of nothing but lime and pumice-stones. The walls below were decorated with lead and braids, and works of carved silver over them; and the roof was covered on the outside with plates of gilded bronze. There was an ascent from the springing of the roof to the very summit by a flight of seven stairs. And if certain authors may be credited, these stairs were ornamented with pedestrian statues ranged as an amphitheatre. This notion was founded on a passage of Pliny, who says, \"That Diogenes the sculptor decorated the pantheon of Agrippa with elegant statues; yet that it was difficult to judge of their merit, upon account of their elevated situation.\" The portico is composed of 16 columns of granite, four feet in diameter, eight of which stand in front, with an equal intercolumniation all along, contrary to the rule of Vitruvius, who is for having the space answering to the door of a temple, wider than the rest. Of these columns is a pediment, whose tympanum, or flat, was ornamented with bas-reliefs in braids; the cross beams which formed the ceiling of the portico were covered with the same metal, and so were the doors. The ascent up to the portico was by eight or nine steps.\n\nSuch was the pantheon, the richness of which induced Pliny to rank it among the wonders of the world.\n\nThe eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Tiberius, damaged the Pantheon very considerably: it was repaired by Domitian; which occasioned some writers to mention that prince as the founder of the building. The emperor Adrian also did something to it. But it appears, that the pantheon is more indebted to Septimius Severus, than to any one since its erection. The most, perhaps, that any of his predecessors had done, was the adding some ornament to it: Septimius bestowed essential reparations upon it. The following inscription appears upon the architrave:\n\nIMP. CAES. SEPTIMIVS. SEVERVS.\nPIVS. PERTINAX.\nARABICVS. PARTHICVS. PONTIF.\nMAX. TRIB. POT.\nXI. COS. III. P. P. ET. IMP. CAES.\nMARCVS.\nAVRELIVS. ANTONINVS. PIUS.\nFELIX. AVG. TRIB.\nPOT. V. COS. PROCOS. PANTHEVM.\nVETVSTATE.\nOBRVPTVM. CVM. OMNI. CVLTV.\nRESTITTVERVT.\n\nIt is really a matter of astonishment, that a structure, which, granting it to have been built by Agrippa, was not more than 200 years old, should have fallen into decay through age. This single consideration seems sufficient to confirm the opinion of those who believe it to have stood in the times of the commonwealth.\n\nThe temple subsisted in all its grandeur till the incursion of Alaric in the time of Honorius. Zozymus relates, that the Romans having engaged to furnish this barbarian prince with 3000 pounds weight of gold and 5000 pounds weight of silver, upon condition that he should depart from their walls; and it proving impossible to raise those sums either out of the public treasury or private purses, they were obliged to strip the temple.\nIt is probable that the pantheon supplied a good part, as that of Jupiter Capitolinus was the only one in Rome that could vie with it for riches.\n\nAlaric carried off nothing from the Romans besides their precious metals. Thirty-nine years after this, Genseric king of the Vandals took away part of their marbles; and whether from a greediness of plunder, or from a relish of the productions of art, loaded one of his ships with statues. It cannot be questioned, but that on this occasion the pantheon was forced to part with more of its ornaments, and that the indescribable works of Diogenes became the prey of this barbarian.\n\nBefore these unwelcome visits of the Goths and Vandals, the Christian emperors had issued edicts for demolishing the Pagan temples. But the Romans, whatever were their motives, spared the pantheon, which is known to have suffered no damage from the zeal of the pontiffs, or the indignation of the saints, before the first siege of Rome by Alaric. It remained so rich till about the year 655, as to excite the avarice of Constantine II., who came from Constantinople to pillage the pantheon, and executed his purpose so far as to strip it both of its inside and outside brazen coverings, which he transported to Syracuse, where they soon after fell into the hands of the Saracens.\n\nAbout fifty years before this, pope Boniface IV. had obtained the pantheon of the emperor Phocas, to make a church of it. The ruins of these days were totally ignorant of the excellence of the Greek and Roman architecture, and spoiled every thing they laid their hands upon. To this period certain alterations are to be referred, of which we shall speak by and by.\n\nAfter the devastations of the barbarians, Rome was contracted within a narrow compass: the seven hills were abandoned; and the Campus Martius, being an even plain, and near the Tyber, became the ground-plot of the whole city. The pantheon happening to stand at the entrance of the Campus Martius, was presently surrounded with houses, which spoiled the fine prospect of it; and it was yet more deplorably disgraced by some of them which stood close to its walls. Pedlars' sheds were built even within its portico, and the interculumination were bricked up, to the irreparable damage of the matchless pillars, of which some lost part of their capitals, some of their bases, and others were chipped out six or seven inches deep, and as many feet high, to let in posts. Which excavations are to this day half filled up with brick and mortar; a sad monument of the licentiousness of the vulgar, and of the stupid avarice of those who sold them the privilege to ruin the noblest piece of art in the world!\n\nThis disorder continued till the pontificate of Eugene IV., whose zeal for the decency of a consecrated place, prevailed upon him to have all the houses cleared away that encumbered the pantheon, and so the miserable barracks in the portico were knocked down.\n\nFrom the time Constantius carried off the brafs plating of the external roof, that part was exposed to the injuries of the weather, or at best was but slightly tiled in, till Benedict II. covered it with lead, which Nicholas V. renewed in a better style.\n\nIt does not appear that from this time to Urban VIII., any pope did anything remarkable to the pantheon.\n\nRaphael Urban, who had no equal as a painter, and who as an architect had no superior, left a considerable sum by his will for the restoration of the pantheon, where his tomb is placed. Perino de la Vaguia, Jacomo Udino, Hannibal Carracci, Flaminio Vacca, and the celebrated Archangelo Corelli, did the same. All the ornaments within, that have any claim to be called good, are of the later times; the paintings merit esteem; and the statues, though not masterpieces, do honour to sculpture, which alone is a proof that they are posterior to the 15th century.\n\nBut, with all the respect due to a pontiff, who was otherwise a protector, and even a practiser of the arts, it were much to be wished that Urban VIII. had not known that the pantheon existed. The inscriptions cut at the side of the door inform us, that he repaired it; yet, at the same time that he built up with one hand, he pulled down with the other. He caused two belies of a wretched taste to be erected on the ancient front work, and he divested the portico of all the remains of its ancient grandeur, viz., the brazen covering of the cross beams, which amounted to such a prodigious quantity, that not only the vault baldacchino or canopy of the confessional in St Peter's was cast out of it, but likewise a great number of cannon for the castle of St Angelo. This pope, who was of the family of Barberini, presented also as much of this metal to his nephew, as was sufficient for the decoration of his new palace; on which occasion this remarkable paquinade was stuck up:\n\nQuod non fecerunt Barbari fecere Barberini.\n\nIf ever gingle added force to wit, it was certainly in this instance.\n\nIt is surprising, that whilst all these operations were carrying on in the portico, he never once thought of repairing the damages which time had wrought in it! Of the 16 pillars which supported this magnificent pile, there were no more than 13 left; the three next the temple of Minerva had disappeared; with these the entablature and an angle of the front had tumbled down. There were not wanting in Rome fragments enough of antique columns that might have been put together, and set up, to have prevented the downfall of a pile which deserved to stand as long as the world endured.\n\nAlexander VII. did what Urban VIII. had neglected to do. At the same time that Bernini was constructing the colonnade of St Peter, this pontiff ordered search to be made for pillars to match those of the portico of the pantheon; and some were found not far from the French church of St Lewis of the very same model. They were granite of the isle of Elba, and those of the portico were Egyptian granite; the colour, however, was the same, so that the effect was equal. The pope's zeal did not stop here; he caused all the old houses before the portico to be pulled down, and the soil and rubbish to be cleared away which covered the steps, and even the bases of some of the pillars. He began covering the roof with marble, and raised a lantern over the aperture, to keep out rain; but death took him off before his project was completed.\nment IX. his successor, inclosed the portico within iron rails. Several later popes have added to its decorations, which were all in the taste of the times they were done in; and the body of the edifice and its architecture gained nothing from them. The main object of their bountiful liberality was the embellishment of the grand altar. One gave purple curtains, another be- lowed silver tabernacles; others again vases, and superb drapery, suited to the solemn ceremonies of religion. All these might be called rich; but they had in no degree a tendency to retrieve the ancient majesty or original splendor of the temple. The true gusto of the ornaments was a little imitated at the revival of the arts. Good statues took place of skeletons and squat figures that ridiculously disgraced the altars for the space of eight centuries. The paintings of Perugino, Cozza, and Greff, covered the dull mosaics with which the Greeks of Constantinople had loaded the walls of most of the churches in Rome. The porphyry and the green and yellow antique found among the old ruins were employed to much advantage.\n\nThere was besides at Rome another pantheon, dedicated to Minerva as the goddess of medicine. It was in the form of a decagon, and the distance from one angle to another measured about 22 feet and a half. Between the angles there were nine round chapels, each of which was designed for a deity; and over the gate there was a statue of Minerva. The pantheon of Athens was in many respects little inferior to the Roman one built by Agrippa. The Greek Christians also converted it into a church, dedicated it to the Virgin, under the name of Panagia; and the Turks changed it into a mosque. The pantheon of Nimes was a temple in that city, wherein were 12 niches for statues, supposed to have been destined for the 12 great gods. In the Ecurial is a most magnificent chapel, called pantheon, 35 feet in diameter, and 38 feet high from the pavement, which is composed of marble and jasper inlaid. The whole inside of the chapel is of black marble, except the lustrum, and some ornaments of jasper and red marble. In this chapel are deposited the bodies of the kings and queens; there are only places for 26, and eight of them are already filled.\n\nPANTHER. See Felis, Mammalia Index.\n\nPANTING, consists in a rapid succession of inspirations and expirations, which happens when we run or perform any violent motion.\n\nPANTOMIME, παντομίμης, among the ancients, a person who could imitate all kind of actions and characters by signs and gestures without speaking.\n\nThe pantomimes made a part in the theatrical entertainments of the ancients; their chief employment was to express, in gestures and action, whatever the chorus sung, changing their countenance and behaviour as the subject of the song varied. They were very ancient in Greece, being derived from the heroic times, according to some; but however this may be, they were certainly known in Plato's time. In Rome, it was so late as the time of Augustus before they made their appearance. As to their dress, it was various, being always suited as near as possible to that of the person they were to imitate. The crocota was much used among the Roman pantomimes, in which and other female dresses they performed women.\n\nWe have this account of them in Gibbon's history: \"The pantomimes (A), who maintained their reputation from the age of Augustus to the fifth century, expressed, without the use of words, the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity; and the perfection of their art, which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher, always excited the applause and wonder of the people. The vast and magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by 3000 female dancers, and by 3000 fingers, with the masters of the respective cho-russes. Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed, that in a time of scarcity, when all strangers were banished from the city, the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts (B).\"\n\nPantomimes are still very common in England; they differ indeed in some respects from those of antiquity; but they retain the name, and like these they consist in the representations of things merely by gestures.\n\nPANUCO, a town and province of North America, in New Spain, lying to the north of Mexico, with a bishop's see.

The close in which they lay is a little to the south of the fort, on the declivity of the hill to the river, and bounded on the west by a narrow lane, probably the via militaris continued; and is usually shown to strangers as the most remarkable here for finding Roman coins. They are the largest ruins ever known to be discovered in these parts; for they met with three walls besides the pavement; the first lay east and west, and was covered with earth near a foot high; parallel to it at seven yards, they found a second; and between these two, about two yards deep (the height of the walls, which were five yards broad, and strongly cemented), they came to a pavement curiously laid with large flags, three quarters of a yard square, and two or three inches thick, as I measured them: but imagining there must be money under it, they covered it up till night, and then tore it all up. It was composed of flags of different thicknesses: under the thinner was a coarse strong cement, which caused them to be broken in taking up; but the thicker are pretty entire. Part of the wall stood on the floor, and the edge was secured by a fine red cement two inches thick, supposed to be intended to keep the floor dry. They imagined themselves at the corner of the building, the third wall standing at right angles with the first, and the second parallel to the flinty lane, on which was an old hedge. On the floor they found a stone trough, or rather base of a pillar, about a foot high, and the hollowed part square, and two inches deep. They likewise found a small earthen patera, which I procured, of the fine red clay, beautifully smooth, with letters impressed on the bottom; but so defaced as not to be intelligible.—Some years ago, the man's father who found these ruins dug up a conduit. The owner had no coins, nor knew of any.

It would be unnecessary particularly to describe the different expedients which men in every age and country have employed for giving stability to their ideas, and for handing them down to their children. When the art of writing was once discovered, stones, bricks, leaves of trees, the exterior and interior bark, plates of lead, wood, wax, and ivory, were employed. In the progress of society, men have invented the Egyptian paper, paper of cotton, paper manufactured from the bark of trees, and in our times from old rags.\n\nThe inhabitants of Ceylon, before the Dutch made themselves masters of the island, wrote on the leaves of the talipot. The manuscript of the bramins, sent to Oxford from Port St George, is written on the leaves of a palm of Malabar. Herman speaks of another palm in the mountains of that country, which produces leaves of several feet in breadth. Ray, in his History of Plants, vol. ii. book xxxii. mentions some trees both in India and America, the leaves of which are proper for writing. From the interior substance of these leaves they draw a whitish membrane, large, and somewhat like the pellicle of an egg; but the paper made by art, even of the coarsest materials, is much more convenient in use than any of these leaves.\n\nThe Siamese, for example, make two kinds of paper, the one black and the other white, from the bark of a tree called Phokklo. These are fabricated in the coarsest manner; but they can be used on both sides with a bodkin of fullers earth.\n\nThe nations beyond the Ganges make their paper of the bark of many trees. The other Asiatic nations within the Ganges, excepting those toward the south, make it of old rags of cotton cloth; but from their ignorance of the proper method, and the necessary machinery, their paper is coarse. This, however, is by no means the case with that made in China and Japan, which\nwhich deserves attention from the beauty, the regularity, the strength, and fineness of its texture. In Europe they have discovered, or rather carried to perfection, the ingenious art of making paper with old rags, originally either from flax or hemp; and since this discovery the paper produced from our manufactures is sufficient for every purpose. And though these materials have been hitherto abundant, several philosophers have attempted to substitute other vegetable substances in their place. In the 6th volume of the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, we have an account of paper made by Mr Greeves near Warrington from the bark of willow-twigs; and it has been observed by a society of able critics, that hop-buds would probably answer this purpose better. The rags in common use for paper-making are a texture of supple and strong fibres separated by a lea from the bark of the plants. It would be in vain to employ the whole body of the plant, as this substance forms a very improper stuff for the operations of the paper-mill. From these principles we are directed in the choice of vegetable substances fit for the present purpose. The greater or less degree of purity in the materials is not absolutely necessary; for flax itself, without any preparation, could be made into paper; but it would be extremely coarse, and the bark of nettles or malloes would not bear the expense of labour.\n\nAlthough cotton is used in the fabrication of paper in the Levant, and perhaps in China, we are not to conclude that the down of plants in Europe, without the strength or suppleness of cotton, will answer the same purpose.\n\n**History.**\n\nThe chief kinds of paper which merit attention in this work are, 1. The Egyptian paper; 2. Paper made from cotton; 3. Paper from the interior bark of trees or liber; 4. Chinese paper; 5. Japanese paper; 6. Paper made from asbestos; and, 7. Paper made from linen rags.\n\nThis is the famous paper used by the ancients, which was made of a kind of reed called papyrus, growing in Egypt on the banks of the Nile. According to Pliny, this paper was first used at Memphis, and Lucan seems to be of the same opinion,\n\n> Nondum flaminas Memphis connexere biblos  \n> Noverat.  \n> PHARSALE, lib. iii. ver. 222.\n\nWhatever truth may be in this, it is certain, that of all the kinds of paper used by the ancients, the papyrus was the most convenient, both from its flexibility and from the ease of fabrication. It was a present from nature, and required neither care nor culture.\n\nIt is not certain at what particular period the ancients began to make paper of papyrus; but there are several authorities which prove the use of it in Egypt long before the time of Alexander the Great.\n\nPliny, lib. xiii. cap. ii., gives a full description of the method of making this paper in Egypt. They divide, says he, with a kind of needle the item of the papyrus into thin plates or slender pellicles, each of them as large as the plant will admit. These are the elements of which the sheets of paper are composed. The pellicles in the centre are the best; and they diminish in value as they depart from it. As they were separated from the reed, they were extended on a table, and laid across each other at right angles. In this state they were moistened by the water of the Nile, and while wet were put under a press, and afterwards exposed to the rays of the sun. \"It was supposed that the water of the Nile,\" says Pliny, had a gummy quality necessary to glue these stripes together. This, says Mr Bruce, we may be assured is without foundation, no such quality being found in the water of the Nile; on the contrary, I found it of all others the most improper, till it had settled and was absolutely divested of all the earth gathered in its turbid state. I made several pieces of this paper both in Abyssinia and Egypt; and it appears to me, that the sugar or sweetmeats with which the whole juice of this plant is impregnated, is the matter that causes the adhesion of these stripes together; and that the use of the water is no more than to dissolve this, and put it perfectly and equally in fusion.\" When there was not enough of sugar in the plant, or when the water did not sufficiently dissolve it, the pellicles were united by a paste made of the finest wheat flour, mixed with hot water and a little vinegar, and when dried they were flattened and smoothed by the beating of a mallet.\n\nThe size of this paper varied much; it seldom exceeded two feet, but it was oftentimes smaller. It had different names, according to its size and quality: The first was called Imperial, which was of the finest and largest kind, and was used for writing letters by the great men among the Romans. The second sort was called by the Romans the Livian paper, from Livia the wife of Augustus; each leaf of this kind was 12 inches. The third sort was called the Sacerdotal paper, and was 11 inches in size.\n\nThe paper used in the amphitheatres was of the dimensions of nine inches. But what was esteemed of greatest value in it, was its strength, whiteness, and polish. The ink, however, used in paper highly polished; and therefore the characters were more liable to be effaced. When it was not carefully soaked in the first preparation, the paper brought a less price; because letters were with difficulty formed upon it, and it sent forth a disagreeable smell. To remedy this defect, the paper went through a new course of sizing and hammering; and the size used on that occasion was made of light bread steeped in boiling water, and passed through a filtering cloth. By this means the paper became in the highest degree united, and smoother than the finest linen. It was this paper which gave so long a duration to the works of the Gracchi, Tiberius and Caius, in their own hand-writing. \"I have seen them (says Pliny) in the library of Pomponius Secundus, a poet and citizen of the first rank, near 200 years after they were written.\" We may add, that manuscripts of this paper still remain, which have undoubtedly been written 1000 or 1200 years ago. It appears from Pliny, that the Egyptians pasted together the pellicles of the papyrus by means of the water of the Nile; but that the polishing with ivory, and the operations of the hammer and the press, were added by the invention and industry of the Roman artists. The Egyptians seem to have known the use of size; but it is evident from the same author, that the Romans used a stronger size in the making of paper. Notwithstanding the care which was taken to give strength and consistency to the paper of Egypt, the leaves, although collected into a book, were too weak to support themselves; and for this reason it was\nwas a common practice, after every five leaves, to insert a leaf of parchment. There still remains in the abbey of St Germain de-Prés a fragment of the epistle of St Augustine written in this manner. The manuscript is at least 1100 years old, and in a high state of preservation.\n\nThis paper was an important branch of commerce to the Egyptians, which continued to increase towards the end of the Roman republic, and became still more extensive in the reign of Augustus. The demand from foreign nations was often so great, as to occasion a scarcity at Rome; and we read in the reign of Tiberius of a tumult among the people in consequence of this scarcity. In a letter of the emperor Adrian, the preparing of the papyrus is mentioned as one of the principal occupations at Alexandria. \"In this rich and opulent city (says he) nobody is seen idle: Some are employed in the manufacture of cloth, some in that of writing paper,\" &c. During the time of the Antonines, this commerce continued equally to flourish. Apuleius says, that he wrote on the papyrus of Egypt with a reed of the Nile prepared at Memphis.\n\nThe demand for this paper was so great towards the end of the third century, that when the tyrant Firmus conquered Egypt, he boasted that he had seized as much paper and size as would support his whole army.\n\nSt Jerome informs us, that it was as much in use in the fifth century when he flourished. The duty on the importation of this commodity had grown excessive towards the end of this or the beginning of the fifth century; and being abolished by Theodoric king of Italy, Cassiodorus, in the 38th letter of his 11th book, congratulates the whole world on the discharge of an impost on a merchandise so essentially necessary to mankind.\n\nThe fathers Montfaucon and Mabillon mention several fragments written on this paper in the sixth century. One of them was a charter of the emperor Justinian, entitled Charta plenaria securitatis. Father Montfaucon saw in 1698, in the library of Julio Justiniani, three or four fragments of paper of Egypt of the same antiquity. And Mabillon speaks of some books of the Jewish antiquities by Josephus translated into Latin, which seemed to have been written in the same century, and which were preserved in the library of St Ambrose of Milan, but he had not seen the manuscripts. The same father mentions to have seen in the library of St Martin of Tours the remains of an old Greek manuscript of the paper of Egypt, and which appeared to him to be of the seventh century. He also believes, that the copy of St Mark's gospel preserved in the register-office of Venice is written on the same paper, that it is the most ancient of any of the evangelical manuscripts, and may be supposed to be written at the latest in the fourth century.\n\nAccording to the same antiquarian, the paper of Egypt was used in France, and Italy, and other European countries, both for books of learning and public records; and there still remains, adds he, a great number of these in the archives of the church at St Dennis, at Corbie, in the abbey de Graffe, and in other convents.\n\nIt is probable, that the invention of paper made of cotton, of which we are afterwards to treat, infinibily destroyed the reputation and manufacture of the paper of Egypt; but it is still a question at what particular period the fabrication of the latter totally ceased. Euclides, the learned commentator on Homer, affirms us, that in his time in 1170 it was no longer in use; but Father Mabillon maintains, that many of the popish bulls were written on the papyrus in the 11th century.\n\nThe Count Maffei, in his Istor. Diplomat. lib. ii. Biblioth. Ital. tom iii. p. 251, is decidedly of opinion, that the paper of Egypt was not in use in the fifth century. He considers all records written on this paper dated posterior to this period as not authentic; and the popish bulls mentioned by Father Mabillon appear to this learned person, as well as the copy of St Mark's gospel, to be written on paper manufactured from cotton. To reconcile in some measure these contradictory accounts, it may be observed, that on some particular occasions, and by some particular persons, the paper of Egypt might have been employed for several hundred years after it ceased to be of general use. Whoever wishes for a fuller account of the paper of Egypt, may consult among the ancients Pliny, lib. xiii. and Theophrastus, lib. iv. chap. ix. and among the moderns, Guilandinus, Scaliger, Saumaise, Kerchmayer, Nigrifili; Father Hardouin in his edition of Pliny; Father Mabillon in his work De re Diplomat.; Montfaucon in his Paleography, and in his Collections; the illustrious Maffei in his Istor. Diplomat.; the count de Caylus in the Memoirs of the Academy of Inscriptions; and Mr Bruce in his Travels to discover the Source of the Nile.\n\nIt is generally supposed that the invention of the paper made of cotton, called charta bombycina, supplanted the Egyptian from cotton-paper in Greece. This paper is incomparably more lasting, and better calculated for all the purposes of writing. It is not precisely known at what period this art, which supposes a great variety of previous experiments, was first reduced to practice. The application of cotton to the purposes of paper-making requires as much labour and ingenuity as the use of linen rags; and for this reason, if we could determine the precise time when paper was made from cotton, we should also fix the invention of the art of paper-making as it is presently practised in Europe. Father Montfaucon proves, by incontestable authorities, that paper from cotton was in use in 1100. This paper in the Greek language is called χαρτα βυσσινικης, or βυσσινικης; for although βυσσος is the Greek word for silk, yet in those times it was applied, as well as βυσσα, to cotton; and hence the Italians to this day call cotton bambaccio.\n\nThe most ancient manuscript of this paper which Father Montfaucon saw with the date, was that in the French king's library, written A.D. 1050; but as the manuscripts without date are infinitely more numerous than those which are dated, and as some conjecture can be formed concerning them from the manner of writing, this father believes some of these to have been written in the 10th century.\n\nThe researches of the same learned antiquarian amount almost to a proof that this paper was discovered towards the end of the ninth century or beginning of the tenth; for before the twelfth century it was commonly used in the eastern empire, and even in Sicily. Roger king of Sicily says, in a diploma written in 1145, that he had renewed\nrenewed on parchment a charter which had been written on paper of cotton, in the year 1100, and another which was dated in the year 1112. About the same time the empress Irene, in the statutes for some religious houses at Constantinople, says that she had left three copies of the same statutes, two in parchment and one in paper from cotton. From that period this paper was still more in use through all the eastern empire; and innumerable Greek manuscripts are found written on it in all the great libraries.\n\nThis discovery happened at a time when there seems to have been a great scarcity of parchment; for it was about this period that the Greeks erased the writings of Polybius, Diodorus of Sicily, and many valuable ancient authors, for the sake of the parchment.\n\nIt was the invention of this paper of cotton which destroyed the manufacture of the paper of Egypt; for, if we may believe Eustathius, who wrote towards the end of the 12th century, the latter paper had gone into disuse but a little before his time. We may easily believe, however, that this new invention, although of great advantage to mankind, was introduced by degrees.\n\nThe manufacture of this kind of paper has flourished in the Levant for many ages, and is carried on with great success even to this day. It is not necessary to say any thing farther, than that the paper produced from cotton is extremely white, very strong, and of a fine grain.\n\nThis paper of the ancients was made from the white pellicle or inner coat found in many trees between the bark and the wood. The trees commonly in use were the maple, the plane tree, the elm, the beech, the mulberry, and most frequently the linden-tree. The ancients wrote on this inner coat after they had separated it from the bark, beat, and dried it.\n\nThe fathers Mabillon and Montfaucon speak frequently of manuscripts and diplomas written on paper made from bark; and positively distinguish it from the Egyptian paper, because it was thicker, and composed of parts less adhering together.\n\nThere are many palm trees in India and America to which botanists have given the name papyraceous, because the natives have written with bodkins either on the leaves or the bark. Such is the American palm, called tal by the Indians; and of the same kind is the guajara-ba of New Spain. Every palm, the bark of which is smooth, and the leaves large and thick, may be used for this purpose.\n\nThe art of making paper from vegetables reduced to stuff was known in China long before it was practised in Europe; and the Chinese have carried it to a degree of perfection hitherto unknown to the European artists. The fine paper in China is softer and smoother than that of Europe; and these qualities are admirably adapted to the pencil, which the Chinese use in writing. Several kinds of their paper discover the greatest art and ingenuity, and might be applied with much advantage to many purposes. They are capable of receiving, for example, the impression of types; and both maps and prints have been executed with success on the Chinese paper.\n\nThe different sorts of paper vary in China according to the materials of which they are composed, and to the different manner of manufacturing those materials. Every province has its peculiar paper. That of Se-chuen is made of linen rags as in Europe; that of Fo-kien, of young bamboo; that of the northern provinces, of the interior bark of the mulberry; that of the province of Kiang-nan, of the skin which is found in the webs of the silk-worm; finally, in the province of Hu-kuang, the tree chu or ko-chu furnishes the materials with which they make paper.\n\nThe method of fabricating paper with the bark of different trees is nearly the same with that which is followed in the bamboo. To give an idea, therefore, of the manner of manufacturing the interior barks of the mulberry, the elm, and the cotton-tree, it will be sufficient to confine our observations to the bamboo.\n\nThe bamboo is a kind of cane or hollow reed, divided by knots; but larger, more elastic, and durable than any other reed.\n\nThe whole substance of the bamboo, composed of filaments, and a great abundance of fibrous materials, is employed in this operation. The shoots of one or two years, nearly the thickness of a man's leg, are preferred. They strip the leaves from the stem, cut them into pieces of four or five feet long, make them into parcels, and put them into water to macerate. As soon as they are softened, which generally happens in five days, they wash them in pure water; put them into a dry ditch; cover them with lime for some days, which they water for the purpose of flaking; they wash them carefully a second time; cut every one of the pieces into filaments, which they expose to the rays of the sun to dry and to bleach them. After this they are boiled in large kettles; and then reduced to fluff in mortars of wood, by means of a hammer with a long handle, which the workman moves with his foot.\n\nThe fluff being thus prepared, they take some shoots of a plant named koteng, which, steeped in water four or five days, is reduced to an unctuous or glutinous substance; and when they proceed to make the paper, this is mixed with the fluff in certain exact quantities, for on this mixture depends the goodness of the paper.\n\nWhen the extract from the koteng is mixed with fluff of the bamboo, the whole mixture is beat together in mortars till it becomes a thick and viscous liquor. This is poured into large tubs or reservoirs, so exactly framed as that no part of the liquor can escape.\n\nThe workmen after this plunge their forms into the liquor; take out what is sufficient for a sheet of paper; which immediately, from the glutinous substance, becomes firm and thinning; and is detached from the form by turning down the sheet on the heap of paper already made, without the interposition of pieces of woollen cloth, as in Europe.\n\nIn order to dry this paper, they have a hollow wall, the two fronts of which are smooth and extremely white. At the extremity of this wall is placed a stove, the pipes of which are carried in a circular manner through the whole empty space. The sheets of paper are laid on the surface, to which they adhere till they come over them with a soft brush; and after they are dry, it is easy to distinguish the side which received impressions from the brush from that which adhered to the wall. By means of this stove the Chinese dry their paper as fast as they can make it; but it is only in cold seasons, or in certain\ncertain provinces, that they find this expedient necessary.\n\nThe Chinese paper must be dipped in a solution of alum before it can take either ink or colours. They call this operation faner, from the Chinese word fan, which signifies alum. The following is the manner of preparing this solution: Six ounces of iinglafs cut very small is put into boiling water, and constantly stirred, that it may dissolve equally. When the iinglafs is wholly dissolved in the water, they throw in twelve ounces of calcined alum, which is also stirred till it is completely dissolved and mixed with the iinglafs. This composition is afterwards poured into a large and deep basin, at the mouth of which is a little round piece of wood; the extremity of every sheet of paper is fixed in another piece of wood, with a slit made to receive it; by means of this equipage they plunge the sheet of paper into the composition of alum and iinglafs; and when it is fully penetrated, they draw it out, making it glide over the little round piece of wood. The long piece of wood which holds the sheet by one end, and keeps it from tearing, is afterwards suspended with it on a wall till it is sufficiently dry.\n\nThe Chinese give the paper intended for different purposes different preparations. We shall confine our observations to the silver colour which they give to some paper. They take two scruples of paste made of cows hide, one scruple of alum, and a pint of water: the whole is boiled on a slow fire till the water be evaporated. The sheets of paper are then stretched on a smooth table, and covered over with two or three layers of this paste. They take afterwards a certain quantity of talc, washed and boiled in water, with the proportion of one-third of alum; this is dried, reduced to a powder, passed through a sieve, boiled a second time in water, dried in the sun, and again passed through the sieve. This powder is spread equally over the sheets of paper, prepared as we mentioned above; and then they are dried slowly in the shade.\n\nThe sheets of paper, covered in this manner with talc, are laid upon a table, and rubbed with a little cotton; which fixes a certain quantity of the talc in the paper, and carries off the surplus to be used on another occasion. By means of this composition the Chinese draw all manner of figures on their paper.\n\nFormerly the Chinese wrote with a bodkin of iron on tablets of bamboo; afterwards on satin with a pencil; and during the dynasty of their tyrants, about 160 years before Christ, they discovered the art of making paper.\n\nThe paper made from the bamboo is sufficiently white, soft, closely united, without the least inequality on the surface to interrupt the motion of the pencil, or to occasion the rising of the materials which compose it. Meanwhile every kind of paper made from the bamboo or the bark of trees, is readier to crack than that made in Europe; besides, it is more susceptible of moisture, and sooner destroyed with dust and worms. To obviate this last inconvenience, they are obliged frequently to beat their books in China, and to expose them to the sun. It may be observed, however, that the Chinese paper, employed for various purposes in Europe, has been preserved for a long time without receiving damage either from moisture or insects.\n\nAccording to Kempfer, the bark of the morus papi-\non additional weights. This pressure, intended to carry off any unnecessary moisture, is continued for 24 hours, when the sheets are suspended, by means of little pieces of reed, to long plants, in the open air, till they are completely dried.\n\nThe extract from rice is made in an unvarnished earthen pot. The pot is agitated at first gently, then more briskly: new water is poured in, and then it is filtered through a linen cloth. The fineness of the process is determined by the viscosity of the substance.\n\nThe infusion of the root orei is made in the following manner: The root, peeled and cut into small pieces, is infused into water for one night, during which time it communicates a viscosity sufficient for the purpose to which it is applied.\n\nThe Japanese paper is of such prodigious strength, that the materials of which it is composed might be manufactured into ropes. There is said at Serige, the capital city of the province of Japan of that name, a kind of it fit for bed hangings and wearing apparel; resembling so much fluff of wool and silk, that it is often taken for them. The following is Kempfer's catalogue of trees used in Japan for the manufacture of paper.\n\n1. The true paper tree, called in the Japanese language kaadfi, Kempfer characterizes thus: *Papyrus fructu mori celte*, *five morus sativa folis urticae mortuae cortice papifera*.\n\n2. The false paper tree, called by the Japanese kafii, kadfire; by Kempfer, *papyrus procumbens laetificens folio longo lanceatae cortice chartaceo*.\n\n3. The plant which the Japanese call orei is named by Kempfer *malva radice vifofa flore ephemero magno panicu*.\n\n4. The fourth tree used for paper is the futobadura, named by Kempfer *frutex vifofus procumbens folio telephi vulgaris emulo fructu racemoso*.\n\nThe description of these trees, given more particularly by Kempfer than the limits of this work will permit, may be of great service to lead botanists to discover the European plants and shrubs adapted, like the Japanese, for the fabrication of paper.\n\nBefore finishing our reflections on this part of the subject, it will be proper to give a just idea of the attempts which have been made to increase the original materials of paper in Europe.\n\nA flight attention to the process in China in reducing the bamboo to a paste, by a careful and ingenious analysis, and to the long and proper method of the Japanese of separating the principal fibres of the bark of the mulberry, will throw the absurdity not only of taking plants without any kind of choice, but of giving them no preparation except that of pounding them with mallets.\n\nWith a proper selection, and good principles, it appears not improbable that many of the European plants might be used with great advantage in constructing several kinds of paper.\n\nIt is evident that the materials used by the Chinese require less labour and preparation than the stuff of linen rags. The sheets of the Chinese paper are easily detached from the form; they are laid in heaps without the interposition of pieces of woollen cloth; the superfluous water is immediately discharged; and they require not, as in Europe, the vigorous action of presses to unite the parts more closely together.\n\nThe asbestos is a fibrous substance of little strength, the threads of which are easily broken. See Mineralogy Index. This substance has the peculiar property of supporting the action of fire without receiving any damage: whence pieces of cloth and garters made of it are incombinable. From the knowledge of this property paper has been made of the asbestos. Dr Brukman, professor at Brunswick, published the natural history of this fossil; and four copies of his book, in the library of Wolfenbuttle, are on this paper.\n\nThe manner of fabricating this paper is described by M. Lloyd in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 166. A certain quantity of the asbestos is pounded in a mortar of stone till it is reduced to a substance like cotton. All the parts of earth or stone remaining in the asbestos are then taken off by means of a fine sieve, and it is formed into sheets of paper by an ordinary paper mill. Mixing it with water reduces it to fluff; only, as it is heavier than that from linen rags, it requires to be continually stirred when they are taking it up with the frames. The only excellence of this paper is, that the writing disappears when it is cast into the fire. It must be observed, at the same time, that as it is of a flender consistency, and easily torn, it is more an object of curiosity than use.\n\nThis paper is manufactured throughout all Europe of linen rags collected in the cities and in the country. This kind of paper was utterly unknown to the ancients. The libri lintei mentioned by Livy, I, lib. iv. Pliny, XIII. c. xi. and by other Roman writers, are demonstrated by Guilandin, in his commentary on Pliny, &c., to have been written on pieces of linen cloth, or canvas prepared in the manner of painters.\n\nBut it is not sufficient to be certain that paper from linen is a modern invention; it is necessary to know by what nation, and at what period, it was discovered. Polydore Virgil, De Inventoribus Rerum, C. II. c. viii. confesses his ignorance of these facts. Scaliger, without any kind of proof, gives the glory to the Germans; and Count Maffei to the Italians. Other writers ascribe this honour to some Greek refugees at Basil, to whom the manner of making paper from cotton in their own country had suggested the idea. Du Halde is persuaded that Europe derived this invention from the Chinese, who, in several provinces, make paper of rags nearly in the same manner that we do. But this invention was practised by the Europeans before they had any communication with China, and before the taking of Constantinople, at which time the Greek refugees were supposed to have retired to Basil. The precise time of this discovery in Europe is not exactly known. Father Mabillon believes that it was in the twelfth century; and cites a passage of Pierre de Clugny, born A.D. 1100, to prove it. The books which we read every day, says that abbe in his treatise against the Jews, are written on sheep and calves' skins; or on oriental plants; or, finally, *Ex rafuris veterum pannorum*. If these last words signify paper, such as we use, there were books of it in the twelfth century. But this citation is the more to be suspected, as Montfaucon himself, after the minutest search in France and Italy, could find no book on this paper antecedent to the death of St Louis, A.D. 1270.\n\nThe epocha of this invention was not determined till 1762, M. Mierman having proposed a reward to the person who could procure the most ancient manuscript written on this kind of paper. The collection of all the memoirs sent to him along with the manuscripts was published.\nIn 1782 the Abbé Andréz published a work entitled *Dell' Origine, Progressi, e Stato attuale d'Ogni letteratura*; wherein he speaks of the discovery of many kinds of paper, and particularly of that made of rags. The Abbé Andréz maintains, that paper made from silk was very anciently fabricated in China, and in the eastern parts of Asia; that the art of making this paper was carried from China to Persia about the year 652, and to Mecca in 756. The Arabs substituted cotton, the commodity of their own country, in place of silk or rather bamboo. This paper of cotton was carried into Africa and Spain by the Arabs. The Spaniards, from the quantity of linen to be found in the kingdom of Valencia, seem first to have adopted the idea of using linen rags; and the most ancient paper of this kind is of Valencia and Catalonia. From Spain it passed into France, as may be learned from a letter of Joinville to St Louis about the year 1260. It is discovered to have been in Germany in 1312, and in England in 1320 and 1342. In consequence of the paper made from cotton in the Levant, the paper from linen was introduced much later into Italy.

Art of Making Paper in Europe.**\n\nTo give a concise view of this subject, it will be necessary to proceed with all the important parts of the operation in their order.\n\nThe selection of the rags, is the arranging of them into different lots, according to their quality and to the demand of the paper mill. In general this selection is very much neglected: The degrees of fineness and whiteness, distinguished with little care, are thought to be the only objects of importance; whereas the hardness and softness, the being more or less worn, are much more essential in this selection. It is certain, that a mixture of soft and hard rags occasions much more loss in the trituration than a difference in point of fineness or of colour. This exactness in the selection is still more necessary where cylinders are used instead of mallets. We cannot do better than to give the method practised in Holland as worthy of imitation.\n\nThey begin by a general separation of the rags into four lots; superfine, fine, middle, and coarse. These lots are given to selectors, who subdivide each of them into five chests. They have besides a bench, on which is fixed vertically a hook, and a piece of scythe which is terminated by a crooked point.\n\nThe person, for example, who has the charge of the fine lot, puts into one of the chests the hard rags, or those which are little used, into another the soft, into a third the dirty, into a fourth those which are stitched or hemmed, and, finally, into the fifth the superfine rags which happen to be among the fine.\n\nAfter this process, the women who have the charge of it are at extreme pains to pick out every kind of foreign, and especially the knots of thread and the hens, by means of the hook or scythe which they have under their hands. They take care also by the same means to cut and reduce the rags exactly by the warp and the woof into small pieces. It is of great advantage to cut or tear the pieces of rags by a thread, whether it be by the warp or woof; because if it is done obliquely, many of the ends are lost in the operation.\n\nWhen they have selected a certain quantity of each of these subdivisions, they are placed on an iron grate, which covers a large chest where they are beat, and otherwise turned, till the filth and dust pass through the bars of the grate and fall into the chest.\n\nThe number of lots in the selection of rags must be proportioned to the mills from which the selection is made, and to the kinds of paper produced by the mill. Some mills, the work of which is considerable, make nine lots of their rags, five of which respect the fineness, and the rest the cleanliness and the colour. In ordinary mills there are only four lots, and in some two.\n\nWe have already observed, that the selection which regards the hardness of the materials is the most essential; because it is of great importance to obtain fluff composed of equal parts, and without any lots. But it is necessary to add, that the fineness and beauty of the paper depend in some cases on a selection not rigorous. Thus, for example, it is of great service to allow the middling to retain some part of the fine, and the fine some part of the superfine; for without this the inferior kinds of paper can never be of great value. The most common fault is to mix the rags of the inferior lots with the superior; which though it augments the quantity of paper, is extremely injurious to the quality. It does much better to mix part of the superior lots with the inferior. It was the want of attention to this mixture which makes some paper mills excel in the superior sorts of paper while the inferior kinds are of a very bad quality.\n\nThe selection of rags being made with exactness, however, and the lots being fermented and triturated separately, the mixture may be made with much greater advantage when they are both reduced to fluff; always taking care that it be in the same proportion as if it were in the state of rags, and only in the manner which we just now mentioned; for the inferior sorts gain more in beauty and quality by this mixture than is lost in fluff; whereas if the fine fluff receives a certain quantity of the inferior, the paper is more damaged in its value than increased in quantity. In this manner the interest of the manufacturer, as in all cases, is intimately connected with the goodness of his commodities.\n\nIn some mills the place for fermentation is divided into two parts, one of which serves for washing away and fermenting the fluff from the rags. After allowing them to steep for some time in a large stone vat, they stir them, and pour in fresh water till the impurities connected with the rags run over. When they are as clean as they possibly can be made by this kind of washing, they are laid in a heap to putrefy. In this condition they experience a degree of fermentation, which is first discovered by a mouldiness of the different pieces of cloth. Afterwards the mass grows warm; and then it is of great consequence to attend to the progress of this heat, in order to moderate its effects; for this purpose, the middle of the heap, where the fermentation is strongest, is turned out, and vice versa. In mills where mallets are used, the putrefaction is carried to a great height, which is frequently attended with two inconveniences. The first is, that\nArt of making Paper in Europe.\n\nThat a part of the rags is reduced to an earthy substance, which is found in great abundance about the cutting table, as we shall afterwards have occasion to see. But besides this waste, excessive fermentation makes the stuff incapable of sustaining the action of the mallets till it is equally pounded. A paper made from a stuff too hard and too little fermented, is coarse and ill compacted; that made from rags too much fermented is composed of fibres without feltness and without strength.\n\nThe second inconvenience is, that the rags turn greasy by too much fermentation, and of consequence it is very difficult to separate and reduce them by all the washings of the trituration.\n\nWe shall not describe the form of the place for fermentation, because in different paper works these places are of different constructions: it is sufficient to say, that they are all placed in low situations and made very close. The selected rags are placed in them in heaps, and watered from time to time to bring on the fermentation. In different paper mills they practice different methods in the putrefaction of their rags.\n\nIn certain provinces in France, they lay in the place for putrefaction a heap equivalent to what the mill can triturate in a month. When this is equally and sufficiently moistened by means of moveable pipes, they cover it with an old heap, which has lain a month in a state of fermentation. When this old heap is exhausted by the mill, the new one becomes a covering to another, and so on. From this detail it is easy to perceive, that there must be near three weeks difference of putrefaction in the same heap, and also that in this method there is no allowance for those seasons in which the fermentation advances more rapidly.\n\nIn general the putrefaction goes on more slowly in proportion to the fineness of the rags. But when, on any occasion, it advances more rapidly than the demand from the mill, the rags are turned over and watered, to stop the fermentation and prevent the bad effects.\n\nAll the inconveniences attending the excess of putrefaction are remedied in Holland by machines which triturate the rags without having recourse to it; and their success in this manner of preparing the stuff has attracted the notice of the French artists, some of whom have adopted with advantage the Dutch machinery.\n\nMeanwhile, it is possible to carry the method of putrefaction to much greater perfection; and several manufacturers have made attempts to well concert, as to deserve the attention of those who study the subject.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Brussels some paper manufacturers, who have constructed their mills after the Dutch plan, have still found it necessary to putrefy their rags; but, at the same time, they have an excellent method for moderating the effects of this putrefaction. In the great galleries connected with the buildings of the paper mill, they have constructed a continuation of chutes, capable each of them of containing a certain quantity of rags; for example, the quantity which the cylinder can triturate in one day. The number of chutes is equal to the number of days which the rags in any season require for putrefaction; and the number actually employed is greater or less according to the season. In prosecuting this plan, they lay a heap of rags in one chute, as often as they take one from another. It should also be observed, that, for the sake of the fermentation, the rags are first moistened in a large hollow stone before they are arranged into the chutes.\n\nThe peculiar advantages of this method are, the equal fermentation of the rags, without any part of them being weakened; great ease in washing them; and it is even pretended, that a less degree of fermentation renders the impurities and the discoloured parts both of hemp and linen more soluble, and consequently the stuff of a purer white.\n\nWhen the rags are reduced to a proper state of putrefaction, they are carried to the cutting table, which is placed on solid treffels, and enclosed on three sides to contain the rags cut on it. Before the table is fixed vertically a part of the blade of a scythe, the edge of which is turned from the operator. This workman, in a situation rather elevated, takes from the left side a handful of the putrefied rags, and arranging them the long way, gives them a gentle twist, presses the half-formed rope against the blade of the scythe, and, in the manner of sawing, cuts it into three or four pieces, which he throws to the right side of the table. In this operation the rags lose part of their filth, and especially of the earthy particles occasioned by too much putrefaction.\n\nWhen the rags have been submitted to all the foregoing operations, they are in a condition to be reduced triturating into a fibrous stuff, of which the paper is made. To obtain this stuff, mills are constructed on different principles. Those which have been used for a long time over all Europe, and which by a statement in the Encyclopédie Methodique, published at Paris in 1789, are still used in France, are mills with mallets. But the mills invented by the Dutch, and used in the neighbouring provinces, and, excepting one instance, in every part of Great Britain, are mills with cylinders or rollers. In the former of these, the mallets are raised by notches fixed at convenient distances in a large circular beam of wood. The teeth fixed on the end of the mallet fall into a corresponding gap made the whole breadth of the plate, and the strokes are repeated till the rags are reduced to a proper consistence. On supplying the vat with water, and carrying off all the impurities, the operation is nearly similar to that in the mills with cylinders.\n\nSuch is the nature of what may be called the old method of making paper. It was proper to speak of this old method, because at one time, and that not very distant, it universally prevailed. That it was inferior to that now in practice, seems very evident; and that the rotting of the rags was peculiarly absurd, cannot be denied, as the paper made of fermented stuff could neither be so strong nor so durable as that which is made in the common way without putrefaction. The only kind of paper that, with any propriety, could be made from putrefied stuff, was pateboard; but we are informed by the most intelligent papermakers in Britain, that they seldom or never even putrefy the rags or ropes of which pateboard is made. It will now be requisite to state the method presently in practice, with the improvements lately made in the art.\n\nThe duster is made in the form of a cylinder, four and a half feet in diameter, and five feet in length. It is altogether covered with a wire net, and put in motion by its connection with some part of the machinery.\nconvenient quantity of rags before the selection are enclosed in the duster, and the rapidity of its motion separates the dust from them, and forces it through the wire. It is of considerable advantage to use the duster before selection, as it makes that operation less pernicious to the selectors.\n\nThe selection is performed much in the same manner as we have already described; only it is found more convenient to have the tables for cutting off the knots and stitching, and for forming them into a proper shape, in the same place with the cutting table. The surface both of these and of the cutting table is composed of a wire net, which in every part of the operation allows the remaining dust and refuse of every kind to escape.\n\nThe rags, without any kind of putrefaction are again carried from the cutting table back to the duster, and from thence to the engine, where, in general, they are in the space of six hours reduced to the fluff proper for making paper. The hard and soft of the same quality are placed in different lots; but they can be reduced to fluff at the same time, provided the soft be put somewhat later into the engine.\n\nThe engine is that part of the mill which performs the whole action of reducing the rags to paste, or, as it may be termed, of trituration. The number of the engines depends on the extent of the paper work, on the force of water, or on the construction of the machinery.\n\nIt will afford a sufficient idea of the work, to give in detail a description of the different parts of the engine. Figure 1 represents the chapter which covers the roller. It is four feet three inches in length, and two feet eight inches in breadth. The superior part is pierced with two openings running crosswise, 1, 2, 3, 4, into which enter the chaffers, or wicker frames, figures 6 and 7; the first made of wire cloth, enters into the opening 3 and 4; the second made of hair cloth, and strengthened with several cross bars of wood, enters into the opening 1, 2, serves to retain the small pieces of rags which escape through the first, and prevents them from falling into the dale or hole-scupper, fig. 2. This hole-scupper is placed across the vat of the engine, parallel to the axle of the roller; the part g enters into the notch c of the chapter; and the extremity h enters into the opening k of the tunnel kl (fig. 3.), by which means the water dashed through the wicker frames by every revolution of the roller is precipitated into the canal fh, and loses itself below the engine. The figures 4, 9, and 10, represent the roller in perspective, in plane, and in profile. It is two feet in diameter, and two feet three inches in length. The trundle head A is 16 inches in diameter, about half as much in length, and furnished with seven spindles of iron, which are screwed to the end of the trundle head, made also of iron. The teeth or blades of the roller are 27 in number, and fitted strongly into the wood which composes its body, parallel to its axis. They are of that thickness as to leave as much empty space as they occupy. The exterior face of each of the blades should be made round, and divided into two parts, with a longitudinal motion, as in the profile aa, fig. 10.\n\nThe axis A B of the roller (fig. 4. and 9.) has two parts perfectly rounded in A and in B, which perform the office of pivots. These pivots rest in the pockets A and B (fig. 8.) in the middle of the levers OAH and OBH. It is by means of these levers that they raise at pleasure, or lower the axis of the roller, and fit it exactly, and in a parallel manner, to the plate. The plates (see fig. 5.) are made of steel cut into channels, in such a manner as to correspond with the blades of the roller. Their channels are not perpendicular, but oblique; and there are two rows of them, b x, x d, consisting of seven or eight blades each on one plate.—Those in b x, for the purpose of changing the plate, lie in an opposite direction to those in x d. The levers are kept in their position near the vat by bands of iron, MN and m n; between which they are made higher or lower by the cogged wheel H, which supports one of the extremities. Wedges N n are likewise employed to fix the levers at a convenient height above the plates. Finally, Every vat is supplied with a small slide door, which is occasionally raised to carry the prepared stuff by means of the scuppers of wood to the general repositories.\n\nFig. 4. is placed in the vat fig. 8.; the roller (fig. 4.) working is placed above it in such a manner that the pivots rest in the ends of the levers; the scupper (fig. 2.) and the chapter are disposed in the manner above mentioned. The vat is charged with a proper quantity of rags, and fresh water is admitted by a spigot placed at one of the corners. In this situation, when the engine is put in motion, the roller turning upon its axis draws the water and the rags by the least inclined plane, and making them pass between its blades and the channels of the plate, dashes them against the chapter and the wicker-frames; and, in short, part of them falls back into the vat, and returns into the circulation. The cause of this circulation is evidently the continual void occasioned by the movement of the roller on the one side, and the return of the water and the fluff on the other.\n\nAs all the rags are not thrown towards the part Ed of the chapter, from whence they might fall back into the vat, but a part of them to a greater distance; it is necessary to have the wicker frames formerly described, not only to prevent their loss, but to allow the dirty water to escape. The spigot at the corner of the vat continually supplies this waste of water. This operation would be sufficient to whiten the rags, although the rollers were raised considerably from the plate; and therefore the force and action of the rollers reducing them to fluff must be much more effectual. It requires great skill to conduct the engine, whether it be with regard to the first quantity, to the proper time for adding the softer rags, to the augmenting or diminishing the water in proportion to the trituration; or, finally, to knowing exactly when the stuff is reduced to a proper consistency.\n\nIn the paper manufactory at Montargis, it was attempted to introduce rollers of the greatest strength and the least weight possible, in order to give them the greater rapidity; but the experiment did not succeed: the rollers of prodigious rapidity were found to produce fluff neither in greater quantity nor of superior quality. The most experienced artists have established a proportion between the motion of the roller and the greater or lesser resistance of the rags. And the Dutch, who have arrived at very great perfection in this art, have followed a method totally different from that practised at Montargis. A roller in Holland complete in all its parts\nArt of making paper weighs nearly 30 hundred weight; and they find this necessary for cutting the rags, especially if they have not been putrefied. In proportioning the rapidity to the resistance, they have also discovered, that a slow motion is preferable to a rapid one. The rollers at Saardom, by calculation made from the different parts of the machinery, make about 68 revolutions in a minute; those at Montargis about 166.—In Holland, too, this trituration of the rags is divided into two distinct operations, performed by rollers constructed on different principles: the first of them, for cutting the rags and preparing for the other, is furnished with blades of steel without any moisture, and with a considerable space between them; the second, intended to reduce the stuff to the proper consistency, has a greater number of blades, composed of a mixture of brass and copper. The mills with rollers are in every respect superior to those formerly in use with mallets. Two Dutch rollers of the construction we have just now described will prepare as much stuff in the same time as 24 mallets; they require infinitely less room; they do it without putrefaction, and as they do it in less time, and with less water, they occasion much less waste of the stuff.\n\nWhen the stuff is brought to perfection, it is conveyed into a general repository, which supplies the vat from which the sheets of paper are formed. This vat is made of wood, and generally about five feet in diameter, and two and a half an depth. It is kept in temperature by means of a grate introduced by a hole, and surrounded on the inside of the vat with a cage of copper. For fuel to this grate, they use charcoal or wood; and, frequently, to prevent smoke, the wall of the building comes in contact with one part of the vat, and the fire has no communication with the place where they make the paper.\n\nEvery vat is furnished on the upper part with planks, enclosed inwards, and even raised in with wood, to prevent any of the stuff from running over in the operation. Across the vat is a plank which is called the trepan, pierced with holes at one of the extremities, and resting on the planks which surround the vat.\n\nThe forms or moulds are composed of wire-cloth, and a moveable frame. It is with these that they fetch up the stuff from the vat, in order to form the sheets of paper. The sides of the form are made of oak, which is previously steeped in water, and otherwise prepared to prevent warping. The wire-cloth is made larger than the sheet of paper, and the excess of it on all sides is covered with a moveable frame. This frame is necessary to retain the stuff of which the paper is made on the cloth; and it must be exactly adapted to the form, otherwise the edges of the paper will be ragged and badly finished. The wire-cloth of the form is varied in proportion to the fineness of the paper and the nature of the stuff.\n\nThe felts are pieces of woollen cloth spread over every sheet of paper, and upon which the sheets are laid, to detach them from the form, to prevent them from adhering together, to imbibe part of the water with which the stuff is charged, and to transmit the whole of it when placed under the action of the press. The two sides of the felt are differently raised; that of which the hair is longest is applied to the sheets which are laid down; and any alteration of this disposition would produce a change in the texture of the paper. The stuff of which the felts are made should be sufficiently strong, in order that it may be stretched exactly on the form without forming into folds; and, at the same time, sufficiently pliant to yield in every direction without injury to the wet paper. As the felts have to resist the reiterated efforts of the press, it appears necessary that the warp be very strong, of combed wool, and well twisted. On the other hand, as they have to imbibe a certain quantity of water, and to return it, it is necessary that the woof be of carded wool, and drawn out into a flax thread.—These are the utensils, together with the press, which are used in the apartment where the sheets of paper are formed.\n\nThe vat being furnished with a sufficient quantity of the fabric-stuff and of water, two instruments are employed to mix cation of them; the one of which is a simple pole, and the other a pole armed with a piece of board, rounded and full of holes. This operation is repeated as often as the stuff falls to the bottom. In the principal writing mills in England, they use for this purpose what is called a hog, which is a machine within the vat, that, by means of a small wheel on the outside, is made to turn constantly round, and keep the stuff in perpetual motion. When the stuff and water are properly mixed, it is easy to perceive whether the previous operations have been complete. When the stuff floats close, and in regular flakes, it is a proof that it has been well triturated; and the parts of the rags which have escaped the rollers also appear.\n\nAfter this operation the workman takes one of the forms, furnished with its frame, by the middle of the short sides, and fixing the frame round the wire-cloth with his thumbs, he plunges it obliquely four or five inches into the vat, beginning by the long side, which is nearest to him. After the immersion he raises it to a level: by these movements he fetches up on the form a sufficient quantity of stuff; and as soon as the form is raised the water escapes through the wire-cloth, and the superfluity of the stuff over the sides of the frame. The fibrous parts of the stuff arrange themselves regularly on the wire-cloth of the form, not only in proportion to the water escaping, but also as the workman favours this effect by gently shaking the form. Afterwards, having placed the form on a piece of board, the workman takes off the frame or deckle, and glides this form towards the couche; who, having previously laid his felt, places it with his left hand in an inclined situation, on a plank fixed on the edge of the vat, and full of holes. During this operation the workman applies his frame, and begins a second flake. The couche seizes this instant, takes with his left hand the form, now sufficiently dry, and laying the sheet of paper upon the felt, returns the form by gliding it along the trepan of the vat.\n\nThey proceed in this manner, laying alternately a sheet and a felt, till they have made six quires of paper, which is called a poff; and this they do with such dexterity, that, in many sorts of paper, two men make upwards of 20 pofts in a day. When the last sheet of the poff is covered with the last felt, the workmen about the vat unite together, and submit the whole heap to the action of the press. They begin at first to press it with a middling lever, and afterwards with a lever about fifteen feet in length. After this operation another person separates the sheets of paper from the felts, laying them\nThe fluff which forms a sheet of paper is received, as we have already laid, on a form made of wire-cloth, which is more or less fine in proportion to the fluff, and surrounded with a wooden frame, and supported in the middle by many cross bars of wood. In consequence of this construction, it is easy to perceive, that the sheet of paper will take and preserve the impressions of all the pieces which compose the form, and of the empty spaces between them.\n\nThe traces of the wire-cloth are evidently perceived on the side of the sheet which was attached to the form, and on the opposite side they form an affiniment of parallel and rounded risings. As in the paper which is most highly finished the regularity of these impressions is still visible, it is evident that all the operations to which it is submitted have chiefly in view to soften these impressions without destroying them.—It is of consequence, therefore, to attend to the combination of labour which operates on these impressions. The couche, in turning the form on the felt, flattens a little the rounded eminences which are in relievo on one of the surfaces, and occasions at the same time the hollow places made by the wire-cloth to be partly filled up. Meanwhile the effort which is made in detaching the form, produces an infinite number of small hairs on every protuberant part of the sheet.\n\nUnder the action of the press, first with the felts and then without them, the perfecting of the grain of paper still goes on. The vestiges of the protuberances made by the wires are altogether flattened, and of consequence the hollows opposite to them disappear also; but the traces formed by the interstices of the wire, in consequence of their thickness, appear on both sides, and are rounded by the press.\n\nThe risings traced on each side of the paper, and which can be discovered by the eye on that which is most highly finished, form what is called the grain of paper. The different operations ought to soften but not destroy it; which is effectually done by employing the hammer. This grain appears in the Dutch paper; which is a sufficient proof, that though they have brought this part of the art to the greatest perfection, they have not employed hammers, but more simple and ingenious means. The grain of paper is often disfigured by the felts when they are too much used, or when the wool does not cover the thread. In this case, when the paper is submitted to the press, it takes the additional traces of the warp and the woof, and composes a surface extremely irregular.\n\nThe paper, the grain of which is highly softened, is much fitter for the purposes of writing than that which is smoothed by the hammer; on the other hand, a coarse and unequal grain very much opposes the movements of the pen; so that which is beat renders them very uncertain. The art of making paper, therefore, should consist in preserving, and at the same time in highly softening, the grain: the Dutch have carried this to the highest perfection.\n\nThe exchange succeeds the operation last described. It is conducted in a hall contiguous to the vat, supplied with several presses, and with a long table. The workman arranges on this table the paper, newly fabricated, into heaps; each heap containing eight or ten of those last under the press, kept separate by a woollen felt. The press is large enough to receive two of them at once, placed the one at the other's side. When the compression is judged sufficient, the heaps of paper are carried back to the table, and the whole turned sheet by sheet, in such a manner that the surface of every sheet is exposed to a new one; and in this situation they are again brought under the press. It is in conducting these two operations sometimes to four or five times, or as often as the nature of the paper requires, that the perfection of the Dutch plan consists. If the stuff be fine, or the paper flender, the exchange is less frequently repeated. In this operation it is necessary to alter the situation of the heaps, with regard to one another, every time they are put under the press; and also, as the heaps are highest toward the middle, to place small pieces of felt at the extremities, in order to bring every part of them under an equal pressure. A single man with four or five presses may exchange all the paper produced by two vats, provided the previous pressing at the vats be well performed. The work of the exchange generally lasts about two days on a given quantity of paper.\n\nWhen the paper has undergone these operations, it is not only softened in the surface, but better felted, and rendered more pliant in the interior parts of the stuff. In short, a great part of the water which it had imbibed in the operation of the vat is dissipated. By the felting of paper is understood the approximation of the fibres of the stuff, and their adhering more closely together. The paper is felted in proportion as the water escapes; and this effect is produced by the management and reiterated action of the press. Were it not for the gradual operation of the press, the paper would be porous and composed of filaments adhering closely together. The superiority of the Dutch over the French paper depends almost entirely on this operation.\n\nIf the sheets of paper are found to adhere together, it is a proof that the business of the press has been badly conducted. To avoid this inconvenience, it is necessary to bring down the press at first gently, and by degrees with greater force, and to raise it as suddenly as possible. By this means the water, which is impelled to the sides of the heaps, and which has not yet escaped, returns to the centre; the sheets are equally dry, and the operation executed without difficulty.\n\nAccording to the state of dryness in which the paper is found when it comes from the department of the vat, it is either pressed before or after the first exchange. The operation of the press should be reiterated and managed with great care; otherwise, in the soft state of the paper, there is a danger that its grain and transparency be totally destroyed. Another essential principle to the success of the exchange is, that the grain of the paper be originally well raised. For this purpose the wire cloth of the Dutch forms is composed of a rounder wire than those used in France, by which they gain the greatest degree of transparency, and are in no danger of destroying the grain. Besides this, the Dutch take care to portion the wires even where the forms are equal to the thickness of the paper.\n\nAlmost every kind of paper is considerably improved by the exchange, and receives a degree of perfection which renders it more agreeable in the use. But it is necessary to observe at the same time, that all papers\nArt of Making Paper in Europe\n\nThe sheets for drying the paper are in the neighborhood of the paper mill; and are furnished with a vast number of cords, upon which they hang the sheets both before and after the sizing. The sheets are surrounded with moveable lattices, to admit a quantity of air sufficient for drying the paper. The cords of the sheets are stretched as much as possible; and the paper, four or five sheets of it together, is placed on them by means of a wooden instrument resembling a pickaxe. The principal difficulty in drying the paper, consists in gradually admitting the external air, and in preventing the cords from imbuing moisture. With regard to the first of these, the Dutch use very low fires, and construct their lattices with great exactness. By this means the Dutch paper is dried equally, and is extremely supple before the sizing. They prevent the cords from imbuing the water by covering them with wax. In using such cords, the moisture does not continue in the line of contact between the paper and the cord, which prevents the sheet from stretching in that particular place by its weight, and from the folds which the moisture in the subsequent operations might occasion. The Dutch also employ cords of considerable thickness, and place fewer of them under the sheets; by which means they diminish the points of contact, and give a freer and more equal circulation to the air.\n\nThe size for paper is made of the shreds and pairings got from the tanners, curriers, and parchment makers. All the matted parts and the lime are carefully separated from them, and they are enclosed into a kind of basket, and let down by a rope and pulley into the cauldron. This is a late invention, and serves two valuable purposes. It makes it easy to draw out the pieces of leather when the size is extracted from them by boiling, or easy to return them into the boiler if the operation be not complete. When the substance is sufficiently extracted, it is allowed to settle for some time; and it is twice filtered before it is put into the vessel into which they dip the paper.\n\nImmediately before the operation, a certain quantity of alum is added to the size. The workman takes a handful of the sheets, smoothed and rendered as supple as possible, in his left hand, dips them into the vessel, and holds them separate with his right, that they may equally imbibe the size. After holding them above the vessel for a short space of time, he places on the other side with his right hand, and again dips them into the vessel. When he has finished ten or a dozen of these handfuls, they are submitted to the action of the press. The superfluous size is carried back to the vessel by means of a small pipe. The vessel in which the paper is sized is made of copper, and furnished with a grate, to give the size when necessary a due temperature; and a piece of thin board or felt is placed between every handful as they are laid on the table of the press.\n\nThe Dutch are very careful, in sizing their paper, to have every sheet in the same handful of equal dryness; because it is found that the dry sheets imbibe the size more slowly than those which retain some degree of moisture. They begin by selecting the pages in the dry-pan, and after having made them supple, and rendering destroyed the adherence between the sheets, they separate them into handfuls in proportion to the dryness, each of them containing that number which they can dip at one time. Besides this precaution, they take care to apply two sheets of brown paper of an equal size to every handful. This brown paper, firm, solid, and already sized, is of use to support the sheets.\n\nAs soon as the paper is sized, it is the practice of some paper mills to carry it immediately to the drying house, and hang it, before it cools, sheet by sheet on the cords. The paper, unless particular attention be paid to the lattices of the drying-house, is apt to dry too fast, whereby a great part of the size goes off in evaporation; or, if too slow, it falls to the ground. The Dutch drying-houses are built to prevent these inconveniences:\n\nBut the exchange after the sizing, which is generally practised in Holland, is the best remedy. They begin this operation on the handfuls of paper, either while they are still hot, or otherwise as they find it convenient. But, after the exchange, they are careful to allow the heaps to be altogether cold before they are submitted to the press. Without this precaution, the size would either be wholly squeezed out by the press of the exchange, or the surface of the paper become very irregular. It is of consequence that the paper, still warm from the sizing, grows gradually firm, under the operation of the exchange, in proportion as it cools. By this method it receives that varnish which is afterwards brought to perfection under the press, and in which the excellency of the paper either for writing or drawing chiefly consists. It is in consequence of the exchanging and pressing that the Dutch paper is soft and equal, and that the size penetrates into the body of it, and is extended equally over its surface.\n\nThe exchange after the sizing ought to be conducted with the greatest skill and attention, because the grain of the paper then receives impressions which can never be eradicated. When the sized paper is also exchanged, it is possible to hang more sheets together on the cords of the drying-house. The paper dries better in this condition, and the size is preserved without any sensible waste, because the sheets of paper mutually prevent the rapid operation of the external air. And as the size has already penetrated into the paper, and is fixed on the surface, the insensible progress of a well conducted drying-house renders all the good effects more perfect in proportion as it is slowly dried.\n\nIf to these considerations be added the damage done to the paper in drying it immediately after the press of the sizing room, whether it be done in raising the hairs by separating the sheets, or in cracking the surface, it is evident that the trouble of the second exchange is infinitely overpaid by the advantage.\n\nWhen the paper is sufficiently dry, it is carried to the finishing room, where it is pressed, selected, examined, folded, made up into quires, and finally into reams.—It is here put twice under the press; first, when it is at its full size, and secondly, after it is folded.\n\nThe principal labour of this place consists in assorting the paper into different lots, according to its quality and faults; after which it is made up into quires. The person who does this must possess great skill, and be capable of great attention, because he acts as a check on those who...\nArt of making Paper who separated the paper into different lots. He takes them, lays them over his left arm till he has the number requisite for a quire, brings the sides parallel to one another, and places them in heaps under the table. An expert workman, if proper care has been taken in affording the lots, will finish in this manner near 600 quires in a day.\n\nThe paper is afterwards collected into reams of 20 quires each, and for the last time put under the press, where it is continued for 10 or 12 hours, or as long as the demand of the paper-mill will permit.\n\nA method has lately been discovered of bleaching the rags or stuff, which will undoubtedly be adopted everywhere in the preparation of writing paper, provided the expense of the process be not too great. This discovery was made by Scheele, M. Berthollet, and M. Chaptal. The first of these illustrious writers communicated to the Swedish Academy of Sciences an Essay on Manganese, containing a numerous series of experiments, intended to investigate the nature and properties of that substance. Among these experiments were several which pointed out a new state of the muriatic acid, or the acid distilled from sea-salt, otherwise known under the name of the acid or spirit of sea-salt. This state of the muriatic acid was produced by Mr Scheele, in consequence of putting the said acid into a retort or distilling vessel, along with the above-mentioned substance called manganese, and distilling over the acid into a proper receiver; it was found to have changed its nature and properties in a very remarkable manner, while at the same time the manganese remaining in the retort had suffered a very material alteration.\n\nTo the new state of the acid thus produced, in consequence of certain theoretic ideas which Mr Scheele entertained respecting the mutual action of the original muriatic acid and the manganese on each other during the process of distillation, he gave the name of dephlogisticated muriatic acid. Since the time of this original discovery, in consequence of certain changes which have occurred in the theory or philosophy of chemistry, this new state of the acid of sea-salt has been called the oxygenated muriatic acid. Among many other properties of it discovered by Mr Scheele, the most remarkable was, that it destroyed the colour of every vegetable substance which was exposed to its action; or, in other words, it bleached them; or, in the language of the dyers, it discharged their colours; that is to say, whatever happened to be the colour of any vegetable body that was submitted to the action of the oxygenated or dephlogisticated muriatic acid, it always became white, or lost its colouring matter.\n\nIn the year 1786, Dr Beddoes, then professor of chemistry in the university of Oxford, published an English translation of the Chemical Essays of Mr Scheele; and thereby made known to the chemists of Great Britain the power of the oxygenated or dephlogisticated muriatic acid, to bleach or whiten vegetable substances, or to discharge or decompose their colours. But M. Berthollet, a celebrated chemist in France, and one of the members of the Academy of Sciences at Paris appears to have been the first who thought of rendering the above-recited discovery subservient to the purposes of manufacture.\n\nIn 1789, he published in the Annales de Chimie an Essay calculated entirely for the use of manufacturers, by being divested of theoretic discussions; of which the title is, Method of Bleaching Linen or Cotton Cloths, Threads, and Yarns, by means of oxygenated Muriatic Acid, and of some other properties of that Liquor which may be useful in Manufactures.\"\n\nIn the same work, and in the same year, M. Chaptal, another French chemist, published an account of some experiments, in which, among many other applications of the oxygenated muriatic acid to purposes useful in the economical arts, he gives information of having bleached or whitened coarse rags used by the paper-makers, so as greatly to improve the quality of the paper into which they were afterwards manufactured. His preparation of this bleaching liquor differs not from Berthollet's, which is as follows: \"Take six ounces of manganese and fifteen ounces of sea-salt, both reduced to a fine powder; mix these accurately, and introduce them into a retort or distilling vessel; then take twelve ounces of oil of vitriol and eight ounces of water, mixed together, and allowed to cool; add these to the other ingredients in the retort, and connect the retort with a cask or receiver capable of holding twenty-seven gallons and a half of water, but only containing twenty-five gallons, which is to be impregnated with the gas or vapour of the oxygenated muriatic acid; and proceed to distillation, first without and afterwards with a fire gradually raised, till the whole acid comes over.\"\n\nExperiments have been made with this liquor both by some of the principal paper-makers in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh and by Messrs Clement and George Taylors of Maidstone in Kent. By the former it was found, that paper made of rags and pulp whitened in this manner, was superior to any other made of similar materials, not only in colour but in fineness of texture. By the latter, the excellence of the liquor was found to be so great, that probably having never heard of Scheele, Berthollet, and Chaptal, and conceiving themselves to be the first inventors of it, they obtained a patent for its exclusive use, which other manufacturers will doubtless disregar. It is not to be concealed, however, that, even with all the precautions which can possibly be taken at first, various circumstances of imperfection must necessarily remain to be removed by means of farther experience, both in the perfection of the bleaching process and the economy of its application to use; but for the attaining of this experience a short time will rarely be sufficient. The above account, it must appear, refers to the time when the bleaching of rags by this process was first introduced. The practice, we find is still (1805) successfully continued by some of the manufacturers in the vicinity of Edinburgh, and has been improved by using the bleaching salt (the hyperoxymuriate of lime), the right to the preparation of which is exclusively vested by patent in Messrs Tennant and Company of Glasgow.\n\nSect. II. Of the different Kinds of Paper.\n\nThe paper proper for writing should be without writing knots, without any parts of the stuff not triturated, without folds, and without wrinkles, of a supple texture, its grain uniform and regular, softened in the exchange,\nexchange, and not destroyed by smoothing. The ground of this paper must be extremely white, or shaded with a very light blue, which adds to its natural splendor. It is of great importance that it be fully and equally sized, otherwise the writing cannot be well finished, and the turnings of the letters will be very imperfect. This paper should be made from stuff not putrefied, which takes a better grain, receives more benefit from the exchange, is more equally sized, and, finally, is less subject to folds and wrinkles in the different operations. To make paper peculiarly fit for durable writing, Dr Lewis recommends the impregnation of it with astringent materials. \"It is observable (says he) that writings first begin to fade or change their colour on the back of the paper, where the larger strokes have sunk in, or are visible through it; as if part of the irony matter of the vitriol was in a more subtle or dissolved state than the rest, and sunk further, on account of its not being fully disengaged from the acid, or sufficiently combined with the astringent matter of the galls. Hence, it should seem probable, that if the paper was impregnated with astringent matter, the colour of the ink would be more durable. To see how far this notion was well founded, I dipped some paper in an infusion of galls: and, when dry, repeated the dipping a second and third time. On the paper thus prepared, and some that was unprepared, I wrote with different inks; several of which, that the effects might be more sensible, had an over-proportion of vitriol. The writings being exposed to the weather till the best of the inks on the unprepared paper had faded and changed their colour, those on the prepared paper were all found to retain their blackness. It is therefore recommended to the consideration of the paper-makers, whether a particular kind of paper might not be prepared for those uses where the long duration of the writing is of principal importance, by impregnating it with galls or other astringents, in some of the operations it passes through before it receives the glazing; as, for instance, by using an astringent infusion, instead of common water, in the last operation, when the matter is reduced into a pulp for being formed into sheets. The brownish hue which the paper receives from the galling, would not perhaps be any great obstacle to its use; and, if the proposal should be thought worthy of being carried into execution, further inquiries may possibly discover the means of obviating the imperfection, and communicating astringency without colour.\"\n\nThe paper used for drawing, or for coloured maps, is in some mills made from one kind of white stuff, either fine or middling; in others, from a mixture of three or four kinds of stuff of different colours. The Dutch were not long ago almost wholly in possession of this manufacture. The same qualities are necessary in this paper as in that for writing. The grain, however, must be a little more raised, although softened by the exchange; for, without this grain, the pencil would leave with difficulty the traces of the objects. Great care is also necessary in the sizing of this paper, that the drawing be neatly performed, and also that the sinking of the ink or colours into the irregularities of the stuff be prevented.\n\nThis paper is also made in greatest perfection by stuffs better condition to receive all the impressions of the different painter. It is also necessary that furniture paper be well softened, and submitted to the exchange, to take more exactly the outlines of the figures. The French have carried this part of the manufacture of paper to the highest state of perfection.\n\nThe British and Dutch have had the greatest success in manufacturing pasteboard, which they make either from a single mat of stuff on the form, or from a collection of several sheets pasted together. In both cases, the sheets of pasteboard are made of stuff not cloth-rotted, and triturated with rollers furnished with blades of well tempered steel. By the operation of the exchange, and smoothing continued for a long time, the British and Dutch obtain solid and smooth stuffs, which neither break under the folds of cloth nor adhere to them. The stuffs not putrefied have another advantage in this species of pasteboard, namely, that of resisting the action of heat, which they experience between the folds of cloth, without wasting or tarnishing, and of consequence they may be used for a long time.\n\nIn England they have at least equalled any other nation in the manufacture of this paper; and even in Scotland they have arrived to such a degree of perfection in this art, that great part of what they manufacture is sent into England. It requires to be made of a soft and equal stuff, without folds or wrinkles, of a natural whiteness, and with a shade of blue. It must be fixed less strongly than writing paper, but sufficiently well to give neatness to the characters. The paper, thus properly prepared, yields easily to the printing press, and takes a sufficient quantity of ink. The stuff must be without grease, and wrought with that degree of fineness as to make it spread equally over the form, and take a neat and regular grain; without this the characters will not be equally marked in every part of the page; and the smallest quantity of grease renders the sizing unequal and imperfect. Some artists with considerable success, both to meliorate the grain, and to reduce the inequalities of the surface, have submitted this paper to the exchange. And it is proper to add, that a moderate degree of exchanging and of pressing may be of great service after the sheets are printed, to destroy the hollow places occasioned by the press, and the relievo of the letters.\n\nEngraving requires a paper of the same qualities as for the last mentioned, with respect to the stuff, which must be pure, without knots, and equally reduced; the grain uniform, and the sheets without folds or wrinkles. To preserve the grain, it is necessary that it be dried slowly in the lowest place of the drying-house. If it is submitted to the exchange, the effects of it must be moderated with the greatest care, and the action of the two first presses must be equally distributed over the whole mats, otherwise the inequality of the moisture at the middle and sides will expose it to wrinkles in the drying. The sizing of this paper must also be moderate. These circumstances are necessary to make it receive with neatness all the soft and delicate touches of the plate.—The soft and yielding paper of Auvergne possesses all these advantages; and accordingly a great quantity of this and of printing paper were formerly imported into Britain and Holland from France, where they still continue to rot the materials from which they make engraving.\nPaper for cards or any kind of painting on a smooth surface.\n\nPaper for cards must be manufactured from a pretty firm fluff, in order to take that degree of smoothness which makes the cards glide easily over one another in using. For this reason the cardmakers reject every kind of paper which is soft and without strength. This kind of paper requires to be very much sized, since the sizing holds the place of varnish, to which the smoothing gives a glazed and shining surface. To answer all these purposes, the rags require to be a little rotted, and the mallets strongly armed with iron studs. Formerly Angoumois was almost the only province in France which folded card-paper to the Dutch and the other northern nations. The rags of Angoumois have the peculiar quality of not turning too soft in the putrefaction, and the mills of that province reduce them to stuff though they be not much putrefied. The French, we believe, excel every other nation in this branch of the manufacture of paper.\n\nSect. III. Miscellaneous Observations on Paper.\n\nTo hinder paper from sinking, take about the size of a nut of rock alum, dissolve it in a glass of clear water, and apply it to the paper, which has not been sufficiently sized, with a fine sponge. It is in this manner that the paper-manufacturers of Paris prepare the paper for drawing called papier laves. When there is occasion to write on a printed book, or on paper too fresh, it is sufficient to mix a little gum with ordinary ink.\n\nTo give to writing paper a brilliant varnish, take that which is of an ordinary fineness, very smooth, without any kind of stain or hairs on its surface; stretch it on a smooth plank, and by means of a hare's foot cover it with a thin and equal layer of sandarac finely powdered. Afterwards, if a whole reel is to be varnished, take eight ounces of rock alum and one ounce of white sugarcandy; bring them to boil in six pints of water; and when the liquor is lukewarm, wet that side of the sheet which has been covered with the sandarac with a fine sponge; lay the sheets in a heap, one sheet exactly above another; and submit the team to the press for the space of twelve hours; hang them afterwards sheet by sheet on the cords of the drying-house; put them again under the press for some days to stretch them; and, finally, beat them with a bookbinder's mallet. This paper can only be used for three or four months after it is prepared.\n\nPainters prepare their paper for drawing, and give it a dark ground, which spares them much labour of the pencil afterwards in those places where shade is necessary. For this purpose, they take white paper and pass a sponge over it, which has imbibed water impregnated with soot, leaving the light places to be formed afterwards. They use also a kind of paper for drawing, which is called tainted paper. A light colour is passed over the whole ground, which deprives the paper of its original brightness, and makes the light places of the print appear more in relief, and more luminous.\n\nThe method most common and most convenient for copying a print, is to use oiled paper. The manner of preparing this paper is to take that which is thin and smooth, known commonly by the name of serpentine paper, and moisten it with a composition, two parts of the oil of walnuts and one part of the oil of turpentine mixed well together. A sheet of pasteboard and a sheet of paper are laid on a smooth table; above them are placed two sheets of paper to be prepared; and a layer of the oil applied to the uppermost is sufficient to penetrate both. This may be done to any number of sheets, and a strong sheet of pasteboard is placed over the whole. The heap is afterwards submitted to the press, under which it remains for two or three days till the oil be completely dry. Paper prepared in this manner serves to copy very readily and exactly all kinds of figures and plans; because being altogether transparent, all the parts of the drawing, whether of light or shade, are easily distinguished.\n\nBesides the paper made from the asbestos, it is necessary for wrapping up gunpowder and valuable writings, to have a paper that will not easily take fire. The manner in which this is prepared is extremely simple. Ordinary paper is dipped into boiling liquid, consisting of three-fourths of water and one-fourth of dissolved alum. This salt, which is not inflammable, covers the surface of the paper, and renders it in some measure inflammable.\n\nIn the season of verjuice, a little of it diluted with water is sufficient for obliterating any fresh spot of ink. The salt of the verjuice dissolved in water answers the purpose equally well, and the salt of ferro or oxalic acid is also employed with this view. If the spots be dry, and the above acids are insufficient to eradicate them, a little aquafortis diluted in water, and applied with the feather of a quill or a fine hair pencil, will make them entirely disappear.\n\nBooks and manuscripts are sometimes defaced by accidental stains with oil. To remove such blemishes, for taking burn sheep's bones, and reduce them to a fine powder; lay a quantity of this powder on each side of the stain; place it between two sheets of white paper, and submit it for twelve hours to the press. If the stains have not disappeared, it will be necessary to reiterate the process.\n\nTo make oiled papers take colours; mix with the colours a very small quantity either of the gall of a pine or carp; and as these substances are of the nature of soap, they dissolve the grease that is in the paper, and, therefore, permit the colours to be spread over the surface.\n\nEmery paper, which is employed for taking the rust from iron without wasting it, is made by impregnating coarse paper with gummed water or any other tenacious substance, and then covering it over with the finest emery.\n\nThe colours proper for paper are not different from those used for other substances, and are enumerated under the article COLOUR-Making. They are applied to paper with soft brushes, after being tempered to a due degree with size or gum-water. If the paper on which they are to be laid is soft, so that the colours are apt to go through, it must also be fixed before they are laid on, or a proportionally larger quantity must be used along with the colours themselves. If a considerable extent of the paper is to be done over with one colour,\nMiscellaneous Observations on Paper.\n\nTo gild paper.\n\nTake yellow ochre, grind it with rain-water, and lay a ground with it upon the paper all over; when dry, take the white of eggs, beat it clear with white sugar-candy, and strike it all over; then lay on the leaf-gold; and when dry, polish it with a tooth. Some take saffron, boil it in water, and dissolve a little gum into it; then they strike it over the paper, lay on the gold; and, when dry, they polish it.\n\nTo silver paper after the Chinese method without flour.\n\nTake two scruples of clear glue made of neats leather, one scruple of white alum, and half a pint of clear water; simmer the whole over a slow fire, till the water is consumed, or the foam ceases: Then, your sheets of paper being laid on a smooth table, you dip a pretty large pencil into that glue, and daub it over as even as you can, repeating this two or three times; then sift the powder of talc through a fine sieve, made of horse-hair or gauze, over it; and then hang it up to dry; and, when dry, rub off the superfluous talc, which serves again for the same purpose. The talc you prepare in the following manner: Take fine white transparent Mucovy talc; boil it in clear water for four hours; then take it off the fire, and let it stand so for two days; then take it out, wash it well, and put it into a linen rag, and beat it pieces with a mallet; to 10 pounds of talc add 3 pounds of white alum, and grind them together in a little hand-mill; sift it through a gauze-sieve; and being thus reduced to a powder, put it into water, and just boil it up; then let it sink to the bottom, pour off the water from it, place the powder in the sun to dry, and it will become of a hard consistence. Beat this in a mortar to an impalpable powder, and keep it, for the use above mentioned, free from dust.\n\nWhite and coloured grounds for paper hangings.\n\nThe common grounds laid in water are made by mixing whiting with the common glovers size, and laying it on the paper with a proper brush in the most even manner. This is all that is required, where the ground is to be left white; and the paper being then hung on a proper frame till it be dry, is fit to be painted. When coloured grounds are required, the same method must be pursued, and the ground of whiting first laid; except in pale-colours, such as straw-colours or pink, where a second coating may sometimes be spared, by mixing some strong colour with the whiting.\n\nThere are three methods by which paper hangings are painted; the first by printing on the colours; the second by using the pencil; and the third by laying them on with a pencil, as in other kinds of painting.\n\nWhen the colours are laid on by printing, the impression is made by wooden prints; which are cut in such manner, that the figure to be expressed is made to project from the surface by cutting away all the other part; and this, being charged with the colours tempered with their proper vehicle, by letting it gently down on a block on which the colour is previously spread, conveys it from thence to the ground of the paper, on which it is made to fall more forcibly by means of its weight, and the effort of the arm of the person who uses the print. It is easy to conclude, that there must be as many separate prints as there are colours to be printed. But where there are more than one, great care must be taken, after the first, to let the print fall exactly in the same part of the paper as that which went before; otherwise the figure of the design would be brought into irregularity and confusion. In common paper of low price, it is usual, therefore, to print only the outlines, and lay on the rest of the colours by stencilling; which both saves the expense of cutting more prints, and can be practised by common workmen, not requiring the great care and dexterity necessary to the using several prints.\n\nThe manner of stencilling the colours is this. The figure, which all the parts of any particular colour make in the design to be painted, is to be cut out, in a piece of thin leather or oil-cloth, which pieces of leather or oil-cloth are called stencils; and being laid flat on the sheets of paper to be printed, spread on a table or floor, are to be rubbed over with the colour, properly tempered, by means of a large brush. The colour passing over the whole is consequently spread on those parts of the paper where the cloth or leather is cut away, and give the same effect as if laid on by a print. This is nevertheless only practicable in parts where there are only detached masses or spots of colours; for where there are small continued lines, or parts that run one into another, it is difficult to preserve the connection or continuity of the parts of the cloth, or to keep the smaller corners close down to the paper; and therefore, in such cases, prints are preferable. Stencilling is indeed a cheaper method of ridding coarse work than printing; but without such extraordinary attention and trouble as render it equally difficult with printing, it is far less beautiful and exact in the effect. For the outlines of the spots of colour want that sharpness and regularity that are given by prints, besides the frequent extraneous, or deviations from the just figure, which happen by the original misplacing of the stencils, or the shifting the place of them during the operation.\n\nPencilling is only used in the case of nicer work, such as the better imitations of the India paper. It is performed in the same manner as other paintings in water or varnish. It is sometimes used only to fill the outlines already formed by printing, where the price of the colour, or the exactness of the manner in which it is required to be laid on, render the stencilling or printing it less proper; at other times, it is used for forming or delineating some parts of the design, where a spirit of freedom and variety, not to be had in printed outlines, are desired to be had in the work.\n\nThe paper designed for receiving the flock is first managed prepared with a varnish-ground with some proper colour, or by that of the paper itself. It is frequently practised to print some mosaic, or other small running figure in colours, on the ground, before the flock be laid on; and it may be done with any pigment of the colour desired, tempered with varnish, and laid on by a print cut correspondently to that end.\n\nThe method of laying on the flock is this. A wooden print being cut, as is above described, for laying on the colour in such manner that the part of the design which is intended for the flock may project beyond the rest of the surface, the varnish is put on a block covered with the leather or oil-cloth, and the print is to be used also in the same manner, to lay the varnish on all\nMiscellaneous Observations on Paper.\n\nall the parts where the flock is to be fixed. The sheet, thus prepared by the varnished impression, is then to be removed to another block or table, and to be fired over with flock; which is afterwards to be gently combed by a board, or some other flat body, to make the varnish take the better hold of it: and then the sheet is to be hung on a frame till the varnish be perfectly dry; at which time the superfluous part of flock is to be brushed off by a soft camel's-hair brush; and the proper flock will be found to adhere in a very strong manner.\n\nThe method of preparing the flock is, by cutting woollen rags or pieces of cloth with the hand, by means of a large bill or chopping knife; or by means of a machine worked by a horse-mill.\n\nThere is a kind of counterfeit flock-paper, which, when well managed, has very much the same effect to the eye as the real, though done with less expense. The manner of making this fort is, by laying a ground of varnish on the paper; and having afterwards printed the design of the flock in varnish, in the same manner as for the true; instead of the flock, some pigment, or dry colour, of the same hue with the flock required by the design, but somewhat of a darker shade, being well powdered, is thrown on the printed varnish, and produces nearly the same appearance.\n\n---\n\nPaper-Money is a term frequently made use of for bank-bills, which pass currently in trade instead of gold and silver.\n\nConcerning this species of currency, the national utility of which has been controverted by some, we have the following observations in Dr Smith's Treatise on the Wealth of Nations: \"The substitution of paper in the room of gold and silver money replaces a very expensive instrument of commerce with one much less costly, and sometimes equally convenient. Circulation comes to be carried on by a new wheel, which it costs less both to erect and maintain than the old one.\n\n\"When the people of any particular country have such confidence in the fortune, probity, and prudence of a particular banker, as to believe that he is always ready to pay upon demand such of his promissory notes as are likely at any time to be presented to him, those notes come to have the same currency as gold and silver money, from the confidence that such money can at any time be had for them.\n\n\"A particular banker lends among his customers his own promissory notes, to the amount, we shall suppose, of 100,000l. As those notes serve all the purposes of money, his debtors pay him the same interest as if he had lent them so much money. This interest is the source of his gain. Though some of those notes are continually coming back upon him for payment, part of them continue to circulate for months and years together. Though he has generally in circulation, therefore, notes to the amount of 100,000l. 20,000l. in gold and silver may frequently be a sufficient provision for answering occasional demands. By this operation, therefore, 20,000l. in gold and silver perform all the functions which 100,000l. could otherwise have performed. Eighty thousand pounds of gold and silver can therefore, in this manner, be spared from the circulation of the country; and if different operations of the same kind should at the same time be carried on by many different banks and bankers, the whole circulation may be thus conducted with a fifth part only of the gold and silver.\n\n\"Let us suppose, for example, that the whole circulating money of some particular country amounted, at a particular time, to 1,000,000l. sterling, that sum being then sufficient for circulating the whole annual produce of their land and labour. Let us suppose too, that, some time thereafter, different banks and bankers issued promissory notes, payable to the bearer, to the extent of 1,000,000l. referring in their different coffers 200,000l. for answering occasional demands. There would remain, therefore, in circulation 800,000l. in gold and silver, and 1,000,000l. of bank-notes, or 1,800,000l. of paper and money together. But the annual produce of the land and labour of the country had before required only 1,000,000l. to circulate and distribute it to its proper consumers, and that annual produce cannot be immediately augmented by those operations of banking. One million, therefore, will be sufficient to circulate it after them. The goods to be bought and sold being precisely the same as before, the same quantity of money will be sufficient for buying and selling them. The channel of circulation, if I may be allowed such an expression, will remain precisely the same as before. One million we have supposed sufficient to fill that channel. Whatever, therefore, is poured into it beyond this sum, cannot run in it, but must overflow. One million eight hundred thousand pounds are poured into it. Eight hundred thousand pounds, therefore, must overflow, that sum being over and above what can be employed in the circulation of the country. But though this sum cannot be employed at home, it is too valuable to be allowed to lie idle. It will therefore be sent abroad, in order to seek that profitable employment which it cannot find at home. But the paper cannot go abroad; because, at a distance from the banks which issue it, and from the country in which payment of it can be exacted by law, it will not be received in common payments. Gold and silver, therefore, to the amount of 800,000l. will be sent abroad, and the channel of home circulation still remain filled with 1,000,000l. of paper instead of 1,000,000l. of those metals which filled it before.\n\n\"But though so great a quantity of gold and silver is thus sent abroad, we must not imagine that it is sent abroad for nothing, or that its proprietors make a present of it to foreign nations. They will exchange it for foreign goods of some kind or another, in order to supply the consumption either of some other foreign country or their own.\n\n\"If they employ it in purchasing goods in one foreign country in order to supply the consumption of another,\nanother, or in what is called the carrying trade, whatever profit they make will be an addition to the neat revenue of their own country. It is like a new fund, created for carrying on a new trade; domestic business being now transacted by paper, and the gold and silver being converted into a fund for this new trade.\n\n\"If they employ it in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, they may either first purchase such goods as are likely to be consumed by idle people who produce nothing, such as foreign wines, foreign silks, &c.; or, secondly, they may purchase an additional stock of materials, tools, and provisions, in order to employ an additional number of industrious people, who reproduce, with a profit, the value of their annual consumption.\n\n\"So far as it is employed in the first way, it promotes prodigality, increases expense and consumption without increasing production, or establishing any permanent fund for supporting that expense, and is in every respect hurtful to the society.\n\n\"So far as it is employed in the second way, it promotes industry; and though it increases the consumption of the society, it provides a permanent fund for supporting that consumption, the people who consume, reproducing, with a profit, the whole value of their annual consumption. The gross revenue of the society, the annual produce of their land and labour, is increased by the whole value which the labour of those workmen adds to the materials upon which they are employed; and their neat revenue by what remains of this value, after deducting what is necessary for supporting the tools and instruments of their trade.\n\n\"That the greater part of the gold and silver which, being forced abroad by those operations of banking, is employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, is and must be employed for purchasing those of this second kind, seems not only probable, but almost unavoidable. Though some particular men may sometimes increase their expense very considerably, though their revenue does not increase at all, we may be assured that no class or order of men ever does so; because, though the principles of common prudence do not always govern the conduct of every individual, they always influence that of the majority of every class or order. But the revenue of idle people, considered as a class or order, cannot in the smallest degree be increased by those operations of banking. Their expense in general, therefore, cannot be much increased by them, though that of a few individuals among them may, and in reality sometimes is. The demand of idle people, therefore, for foreign goods, being the same, or very nearly the same, as before, a very small part of the money, which being forced abroad by those operations of banking, is employed in purchasing foreign goods for home consumption, is likely to be employed in purchasing those for their use. The greater part of it will naturally be destined for the employment of industry, and not for the maintenance of idleness.\n\n\"When we compute the quantity of industry which the circulating capital of any society can employ, we must always have regard to those parts of it only which consist in provisions, materials, and finished work; the other, which consists in money, and which serves only to circulate those three, must always be deducted. In order to put industry into motion, three things are requisite; materials to work upon, tools to work with, and the wages or recompense for the sake of which the work is done. Money is neither a material to work upon, nor a tool to work with; and though the wages of the workman are commonly paid to him in money, his real revenue, like that of all other men, consists, not in the money, but in the money's worth; not in the metal pieces, but in what can be got for them.\n\n\"The quantity of industry which any capital can employ, must evidently be equal to the number of workmen whom it can supply with materials, tools, and a maintenance suitable to the nature of the work. Money may be requisite for purchasing the materials and tools of the work, as well as the maintenance of the workmen. But the quantity of industry which the whole capital can employ, is certainly not equal both to the money which purchases, and to the materials, tools, and maintenance, which are purchased with it; but only to one or other of those two values, and to the latter more properly than to the former.\n\n\"When paper is substituted in the room of gold and silver money, the quantity of the materials, tools, and maintenance, which the whole circulating capital can supply, may be increased by the whole value of gold and silver which used to be employed in purchasing them. The whole value of the great wheel of circulation and distribution is added to the goods which are circulated and distributed by means of it. The operation, in some measure, resembles that of the undertaker of some great work, who, in consequence of some improvement in mechanics, takes down his old machinery, and adds the difference between its price and that of the new to his circulating capital, to the fund from which he furnishes materials and wages to his workmen.\n\n\"What the proportion is which the circulating money of any country bears to the whole value of the annual produce circulated by means of it, it is perhaps impossible to determine. It has been computed by different authors at a fifth, at a tenth, at a twentieth, and at a thirtieth part of that value. But how small forever the proportion which the circulating money may bear to the whole value of the annual produce, as but a part, and frequently but a small part, of that produce, is ever destined for the maintenance of industry, it must always bear a very considerable proportion to that part. When, therefore, by the substitution of paper, the gold and silver necessary for circulation is reduced to perhaps a fifth part of the former quantity, if the value of only the greater part of the other four fifths be added to the funds which are destined for the maintenance of industry, it must make a very considerable addition to the quantity of that industry, and consequently to the value of the annual produce of land and labour.\n\n\"That part of his capital which a dealer is obliged to keep by him unemployed, for answering occasional demands, is too much dead stock, producing nothing either to him or to his country. The judicious operations of banking enable him to make it active and productive. The gold and silver money which circulates in any country, and by means of which the produce of its land and labour is annually circulated and distributed to the proper consumers, is, in the same manner as the ready money of the dealer, all dead stock. It\nis a very valuable part of the capital of the country, which produces nothing to the country. The judicious operations of banking, by substituting paper in the room of a great part of it, enables the country to make a great part of this dead stock active and productive. The gold and silver money which circulates in any country, may very properly be compared to a highway, which, while it circulates and carries to market all the grats and corn of the country, produces itself not a single pile of either. The judicious operations of banking, by providing, if I may be allowed so violent a metaphor, a fort of waggon-way through the air, enable the country to convert, as it were, a great part of its highways into good pastures and corn fields, and thereby to increase very considerably the annual produce of its land and labour. The commerce and industry of the country, however, it must be acknowledged, though they may be somewhat augmented, cannot be altogether secure, when they are thus, as it were, suspended upon the Daedalian wings of paper money, as when they travel about upon the solid ground of gold and silver.\n\n\"The whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in any country, never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it supplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would circulate there if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes, for example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of that currency, which can easily circulate there, cannot exceed the sum of gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual exchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards, usually transacted within that country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, as the excess could neither be sent abroad, nor be employed in the circulation of the country, it must immediately return upon the banks to be exchanged for gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive that they had more of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at home, and as they could not send it abroad, they would immediately demand payment of it from the banks. When this superfluous paper was converted into gold and silver, they could easily find a use for it by sending it abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper. There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole extent of this superfluous paper, and if they showed any difficulty or backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm which this would occasion necessarily increasing the run.\" See Bank and Trade.\n\nPAPER Office, an office in the palace of Whitehall, in which all the public writings, matters of state and council, proclamations, letters, intelligences, negotiations abroad, and generally all despatches that pass through the offices of the secretaries of state, are lodged, by way of library.\n\nPAPIER MACHE. This is a substance made of cuttings of white or brown paper, boiled in water, and beaten in a mortar, till they are reduced to a kind of paste, and then boiled with a solution of gum arabic or of size, to give tenacity to the paste, which is afterwards formed into different toys, &c., by pressing it into oiled moulds. When dry, it is done over with a mixture of size and lamp black, and afterwards varnished. The black varnish for these toys, according to Dr Lewis, is prepared as follows: fome colophony, or turpentine, boiled down till it becomes black and friable, is melted in a glazed earthen vessel, and thrice as much amber in fine powder sprinkled in by degrees, with the addition of a little spirit or oil of turpentine now and then: when the amber is melted, sprinkle in the same quantity of farocolla, continuing to stir them, and to add more spirit of turpentine, till the whole becomes fluid; then strain out the clear through a coarse hair bag, pressing it gently between hot boards. This varnish, mixed with ivory black in fine powder, is applied, in a hot room, on the dried paper paste; which is then set in a gently heated oven, next day in a hotter oven, and the third day in a very hot one, and let stand each time till the oven grows cold. The paste thus varnished is hard, durable, glossy, and bears liquors hot or cold.\n\nPAPLAGONIA, in Ancient Geography, a country of the Hither Asia, beginning at Parthenius, a river of Bithynia, on the west, and extending in length to the Halys eastward, with the Euxine to the north, and Galatia to the south. Pliny enlarges the limits on the west side to the river Billis, on this side the Parthenius. It is called Pylymenia by some (Pliny). Paphlagonia, the people, mentioned by Homer, and therefore of no small antiquity. A superstitious and silly people (Lucian); a brave people (Homer); taking their name from Phaleg (Bochart).\n\nPAPHOS, in Ancient Geography, two adjoining islands on the west side of the island of Cyprus; the one called Halie Paphos (Strabo, Ptolemy, Pliny); the other Nea Paphos; and when mentioned without an adjunct, this latter is always understood. Both dedicated to Venus, and left undisturbed by the poets (Virgil, Horace). Hence Venus is named Paphia. Paphi, the people, (Coins, Stephanus). It was restored by Augustus, after a shock of an earthquake, and called Augula (Dio).\n\nThe abbe Mariti, in his Travels through Cyprus, gives the following account of the island of Paphos. \"It is situated (says he) on the southern side: it contained the celebrated temple of Venus; which, together with the city, was destroyed by an earthquake, so that the least vestige of it is not now to be seen. A lake in the neighbourhood, which even in summer overflows with stagnant and corrupted water, renders the air in some degree unwholesome. On the western coast is the new Paphos, called by some of the modern geographers Bafos; a name which is unknown in the island of Cyprus. That we may not positively ascribe to the latter everything that history tells us of Paphos in general, it may not be here improper to mention that it has been several times destroyed. This city had a port, where vessels trading upon that coast still cast anchor; but this happens only in summer; for, being exposed to every wind, it is extremely dangerous. The bottom of it is full of sharp rocks; which sometimes destroy the cables too much, that mariners are obliged to keep them afloat on the surface of the water, by means of empty casks fixed to them at certain distances. In the neighbourhood there are two castles; one on the borders of the sea, and the other on the summit of a little hill: but the latter is at present in ruins. The government of Paphos consists of a digdaban or commissary; a cadji; and an aga, who presides over the customhouse. Of all the Christian edifices,\nPaphos edifices, there is none remaining but the church of St George, in which service is performed by the Greek ministers. The productions of this part of the island, which are all of an excellent quality, are silk, barley, and other kinds of grain. To discover the origin of the Old and New Paphos, would be carrying light into the midst of the thickest darkness. When we have added conjecture to conjecture, we are still in the same situation. As this is an attempt superior to my abilities, I shall leave it to the divining, though uncertain, knowledge of our antiquaries. I must, however, observe, that there was here formerly a temple dedicated to Venus, which was entirely destroyed by an earthquake. In this island St Paul by his eloquence converted Sergius, a Roman proconsul. He here likewise conferred the deaconship on his disciple and colleague Titus, who soon after suffered martyrdom. Paphos was an episcopal city in the time of the Lusignans; and it is still the seat of a bishop, who is a suffragan to the archbishop of Nicosia. On the western side of the island there are a great number of scattered villages; but they are not worthy of notice, being either abandoned or in ruins.\"\n\nMr Bruce informs us, that in the neighbourhood of this place many silver medals of excellent workmanship are dug up; they are, however, but of little estimation among the antiquarians, being chiefly of towns, of the size of those found at Crete and Rhodes, and in all the islands of the Archipelago. There are some excellent Greek intaglios; generally upon better stones than usual in the islands. This illustrious traveller informs us, that he has seen some heads of Jupiter, remarkable for bushy hair and a beard, which were of excellent workmanship, and worthy of any price. All the inhabitants of the island are subject to fevers, but especially those in the neighbourhood of Paphos. The same traveller observes, that Cyprus was very long undiscovered; for though ships had been sailing on the Mediterranean 1700 years before Christ, and though the island is only a day's sailing from the continent of Asia on the north and east, and little more from that of Africa on the south, it was not known at the building of Tyre, a little before the Trojan war, that is, 500 years after the neighbouring seas had been navigated. It was covered with wood at its first discovery; and our author is of opinion, that it was not well known even at the time of building of Solomon's temple; because we do not find that Hiram king of Tyre, though just in its neighbourhood, ever had recourse to it for wood: though the carriage would undoubtedly have been easier from thence, than to have brought it down from the top of Mount Lebanon. Eratosthenes informs us, that in ancient times the island was so overgrown with wood, that it could not be filled; so that they first cut down the timber to be used in the furnaces for melting silver and copper; that after this they built fleets with it: but finding even this insufficient, they gave liberty to all strangers to cut it down for whatever purpose they pleased; and not only so, but they gave them afterwards the property of the ground they had cleared. Matters are now quite altered; and the want of wood is a principal complaint in most parts of the island. About Acamas, however, on the west side of the island, the wood is still thick and impervious, inhabited by large flags and wild boars of a monstrous size. Mr Bruce was informed, that a live elephant had lately been seen there, but gave no credit to the account.\n\nPAPIAS, bishop of Hierapolis, a city of Phrygia, was the disciple of St John the Evangelist, and the companion of Polycarp, as St Jerome observes, and not of John the Ancient, as some other authors have maintained.

Before entering on the description of the papyrus, it is natural to lay a word or two on the opinion generally received in Europe concerning the loss of this plant. Supposing this loss possible, the date of it must be fixed at no distant period; for it is not 200 years since Guilandain and Prosper Alpin observed the papyrus on the banks of the\nPapirus the Nile. Guilandin saw the inhabitants of the country eating the inferior and succulent part of the stem in the manner of the ancients; a fact which alone shows it to be the papyrus, and of which other travellers seem not to have availed themselves. This practice, together with those related by Prosper Alpin, are sufficient to convince us, that this plant is not wholly useless, although it is not now employed in the fabrication of paper. The alteration on the soil of Egypt, and on the methods of agriculture, have in all probability rendered this plant less common; but causes altogether local could not occasion the destruction of the papyrus, especially as its residence in the marshes would prevent their operation. But it is needless to reason from probabilities or analogy: Mr Bruce not only saw the papyrus growing both in Egypt and Abyssinia, but actually made paper of it in the manner in which it was made by the ancients. He tells us likewise, that, so far from any part of it being useless, the whole plant is at this day used in Abyssinia for making boats, a piece of the acacia tree being put in the bottom to serve as a keel. That such were the boats of ancient Egypt, we know from the testimony of Pliny, who informs us, that the plants were first sewed together, and then gathered up at stem and stern, and tied fast to the keel: \"Conferitur bibula Memphis cymba papyro.\"\n\n\"The bottom, root, or woody part of this plant was likewise of several uses before it turned absolutely hard; it was chewed in the manner of licorice, having a considerable quantity of sweet juice in it. This we learn from Dioscorides; it was, I suppose, chewed, and the sweetness sucked out in the same manner as is done with sugar cane. This is still practised in Abyssinia, where they likewise chew the root of the Indian corn, and of every kind of cyperus; and Herodotus tells us, that about a cubit of the lower part of the stalk was cut off, and roasted over the fire, and eaten.\n\n\"From the scarcity of wood, which was very great in Egypt, this lower part was likewise used in making cups, moulds, and other necessary utensils: we need not doubt, too, one use of the woody part of this plant was, to serve for what we call boards or covers for binding the leaves, which were made of the bark; we know that this was anciently one use of it, both from Alceus and Anacreon.\"\n\nThe papyrus, says Pliny, grows in the marshes of Egypt, or in the stagnant places of the Nile, made by the flowing of that river, provided they are not beyond the depth of two cubits. Its roots are tortuous, and in thickness about four or five inches: its stem is triangular, rising to the height of ten cubits. Prosper Alpin gives it about six or seven cubits above the water; the stem tapers from the bottom, and terminates in a point. Theophrastus adds, that the papyrus carries a top or plume of small hairs, which is the thyrsus of Pliny. Guilandin informs us, that its roots throw to the right and left a great number of small fibres, which support the plant against the violence of the wind, and against the waters of the Nile. According to him, the leaves of the plant are obtuse, and like the typha of the marshes. Mr Bruce, on the other hand, affirms us, that it never could have existed in the Nile. \"Its head (says he) is too heavy: and in a plain country the wind must have had too violent a hold of it. The stalk is small and feeble, and withal too tall; the root too short and slender to stay it against the violent pressure of the wind and current; therefore I do constantly believe it never could be a plant growing in the river Nile itself, or in any very deep or rapid river;\" but in the calmer places where the Nile had overflowed and was stagnant.\n\nThe Egyptians made of this plant paper fit for writing (see Paper), which they call ἑκέλος or philium, and also zegris, and hence the Latin charta; for in general the word charta is used for the paper of Egypt.\n\nThe papyrus was produced in so great quantities on the banks of the Nile, that Caffiodorus (lib. xi. 38.) compares it to a forest. There, says he, rises to the view, this forest without branches, this thicket without leaves, this harvest of the waters, this ornament of the marshes. Prosper Alpin is the first who gives us a plate of the papyrus, which the Egyptians call berdi. This corresponds in some degree with the description of the plant mentioned by Theophrastus; but the best drawing of it has been given by Mr Bruce.\n\nThe ancient botanists placed the papyrus among the grassy plants or dog grass; ignorant of the particular kind to which it belonged, they were contented to specify it under the name of papyrus, of which there were two kinds, that of Egypt, and that of Sicily. The moderns have endeavoured to show, that these two plants are one and the same species of cyperus. It is under this genus that they are found in the catalogues and descriptions of plants published since the edition of Morison's work, where the papyrus is called cyperus nitidicus vel Syriacus maximus papryracens.\n\nIn the manuscripts of the letters and observations of M. Lippi physician at Paris, who accompanied the envoy of Louis XIV. to the emperor of Abyssinia, we find the description of a cyperus which he had observed on the banks of the Nile in 1724. After having described the flowers, he says that many ears covered with young leaves are supported by a pretty long pedicle; and that many of those pedicles, equally loaded and coming from one joint, form a kind of parasol. The disk of this parasol is surrounded with a quantity of leaves which form a crown to the stem which supports it. The stem is a pretty long prism, the corners of which are a little rounded; and the leaves, not at the top but at the side, are formed like the blade of a sword; the roots are black and full of fibres; and this plant is called cyperus Niliacus major, umbella multispici.\n\nThe same Lippi describes another kind which rises not so high: the stem and leaves correspond with the former, but the ears form rather a kind of head than any thing like the spreading of an umbrella; this head was very soft, shining, and gilded, rich and airy, much loaded, supported by pedicles which were joined together at the bottom like the knitting of a parasol. It is called by him cyperus Niliacus major aurea, divisa panicula. These two kinds of cyperus have a marked resemblance in their leaves, their stem, their foliage, and the marshy places where they grow. The only difference consists in their size, and in the position of the ears, which serve to distinguish them; and they seem to bear a resemblance to the papyrus and the fari, described\nPapyrus, described by ancient authors. The first is perhaps the papyrus, and the second the fari; but this is only conjecture.\n\nThe papyrus, which grew in the waters, is said to have produced no seed; but this Mr Bruce very properly calls an absurdity. \"The form of the flower (says he) sufficiently indicates, that it was made to resolve itself into the covering of one, which is certainly very small, and by its exalted situation and thickness of the head of the flower, seems to have needed the extraordinary covering it has had to protect it from the violent hold the wind must have had upon it. For the same reason, the bottom of the filaments composing the head are sheathed in four concave leaves, which keep them close together, and prevent injury from the wind getting in between them.\" Its plume was composed of slender pedicles, very long, and somewhat like hair, according to Theophrastus. The same peculiarity exists in the papyrus of Sicily; and the same is found to exist in another kind of papyrus sent from Madagascar by M. Poivre, correspondent of the Academy of Sciences.\n\nIt is impossible to determine whether the papyrus of Sicily was used in any way by the Romans. In Italy it is called papero, and, according to Cefalpino, pipero. This papyrus of Sicily has been cultivated in the garden of Pisa; and if we can depend on the authority of Cefalpino, who himself examined the plant, it is different from the papyrus of Egypt.\n\nThe papyrus, says he, which is commonly called pipero in Sicily, has a longer and thicker stem than the plant cyperus. It rises sometimes to four cubits; the angles are obtuse, and the stem at the base is surrounded with leaves growing from the root; there are no leaves on the stem even when the plant is at the greatest perfection, but it carries at the top a large plume which resembles a great tuft of dishevelled hairs; this is composed of a great number of triangular pedicles, in the form of reeds; at the extremity of which are placed the flowers, between two small leaves of a reddish colour like the cyperus. The roots are woody, about the thickness of reeds, jointed, and they throw out a great number of branches which extend themselves in an oblique direction. These are scented somewhat like the cyperus, but their colour is a lighter brown; from the lower part issue many small fibres, and from the higher a number of stems shoot up, which in proportion as they are tender contain a sweet juice.\n\nThe plume of the papyrus of Sicily is pretty well described in a short account of it in the second part of the Museo de Boccone. This plume is a tuft or assemblage of a great number of long slender pedicles, which grow from the same point of division, are disposed in the manner of a parafol, and which carry at the top three long and narrow leaves, from which issue other pedicles, shorter than the former, and terminating in several knots of flowers. Micheli, in his Nova Plantarum Genera, printed at Florence 1728, has given an engraving of one of the long pedicles in its natural length: it is surrounded at the base with a calyx of about one inch and a half in height; towards the extremity it carries three long and narrow leaves, and four pedicles, to which are fixed the knots of flowers. Every pedicle has also a small calyx surrounding its base. In short, we find in\n\nthe Grotto Graphia of Scheuchzer a very particular description of the plume of a kind of cyperus, which appears to be the Sicilian plant. From this account it appears that the papyrus of Sicily is well known to botanists. It were to be wished that we had as particular a description of the papyrus of Egypt; but meanwhile it may be observed, that these two plants have a near affinity to one another; they are confounded together by many authors; and according to Theophrastus, the fari and the papyrus nilotica have a decided character of resemblance, and only differ in this, that the papyrus tends forth thick and tall stems, which being divided into slender plates, are fit for the fabrication of paper; whereas the fari has small stems, considerably shorter, and altogether useless for any kind of paper.\n\nThe papyrus, which served anciently to make paper, must not be confounded with the papyrus of Sicily, found also in Calabria; for, according to Strabo, the papyrus was to be found in no place excepting Egypt and India. The greatest part of botanists have believed that the Sicilian plant is the same with the fari of Theophrastus; others have advanced that the papyrus of Egypt and the fari were the same plant in two different stages of its existence, or considered with respect to the greater or less height, which, according to them, might depend on the qualities of the soil, the difference of the climate, or other accidental causes. In proof of this, it is maintained, that there is an essential difference between the papyrus growing in the waters and the same plant growing on the banks of rivers and in marshes. The first of these has thick and tall stems, and a plume in the form of a tuft of hair very long and slender, and without any seed: the second differs from the first in all these particulars; it has a shorter and more slender stem, its plume is loaded with flowers, and of consequence it produces seed. In whatever way we consider these facts, it is sufficient for us to know, that the difference between the papyrus and the fari neither depends on climate, nor soil, nor on situation. The plants whose difference depended on these circumstances, both grew in Egypt, and were both employed in the manufacture of paper. But it is an established fact, that the fari cannot be employed for this purpose.\n\nFinally, The papyrus of Sicily began to be known by botanists in 1570, 1572, 1583, at which periods the works of Lobel, of Guilandin, and of Cefalpino, first appeared. The ancients had no manner of knowledge of this plant. Pliny makes no mention of it in his Natural History; from which it is evident that it was neither used in Rome nor in Sicily. If he had seen this plant, he must have been struck with its resemblance to the papyrus and the fari, as they were described by Theophrastus; and since he gives a particular description of these last mentioned, he would have most naturally hinted at their conformity to the Sicilian papyrus.\n\nAmong many dried plants collected in the East Indies by M. Poivre, there is a kind of papyrus very different from that of Sicily. It carries a plume composed of a considerable tuft of pedicles, very long, weak, slender, and delicate, like single threads, terminating most frequently in two or three small narrow leaves, without any knot of flowers between them; hence this plume must be altogether barren. Those pedicles or threads are furnished with a pretty long membranous calyx, in which\nPapyrus, which they are inserted; and they issue from the same point of direction, in the manner of a parabol. The plume, at its first appearance, is surrounded with leaves like the radii of a crown. The stem which supports it is, according to M. Poivre, about ten feet in height, where there is two feet under water; it is of a triangular form, but the angles are rounded; its thickness is about the size of a walking staff which fills the hand.\n\nThe interior substance, although soft and full of fibres, is solid, and of a white colour. By this means the stem possesses a certain degree of strength, and is capable of resistance. It bends without breaking; and as it is extremely light, it serves in some fort for a cane: The same M. Poivre used no other during a residence of several months at Madagascar. This stem is not of equal thickness in its whole length; it tapers infinitely from the thickest part towards the top. It is without knots, and extremely smooth. When this plant grows out of the waters, in places simply moist, it is much smaller, the stems are lower, and the plume is composed of shorter pedicles or threads, terminating at the top in three narrow leaves, a little longer than those at the plume, when the plant grows in the water.\n\nFrom the base of these leaves issue small knots of flowers, arranged as they are in the cyperus; but these knots are not elevated above the pedicles, they occupy the centre of the three leaves, between which they are placed, and form themselves into a small head. The leaves which spring from the root and the lower part of the stem resemble exactly those in the cyperus. This plant, which the inhabitants call fango-fango, grows in great abundance in their rivers and on their banks, but particularly in the river Tartas, near the Foule-point in Madagascar. The inhabitants of these cantons use the bark of this plant for mats; they make it also into sails, into cordage for their fishing houses, and into cords for their nets.\n\nThis kind of papyrus, so lately discovered, and different from the papyrus of Sicily by the disposition of its flowers, shows, that there are two kinds of the cyperus which might easily be confounded with the papyrus of Egypt; whether we consider, on the one hand, to what purposes the inhabitants of the places where they grow have made them subservient; or, on the other compare their form, their manner of growth, and the points in which they resemble each other. This comparison can be easily made from the accounts which Pliny and Theophratus gave of the papyrus of Egypt; and by the figure and description given by Professor Alpin, after having observed the plant on the banks of the Nile. But if we can depend on the testimony of Strabo, who affirms that the papyrus is found nowhere but in Egypt and in India, it is perhaps possible that the papyrus of the island of Madagascar is the same with that of Egypt.\n\nWhatever truth may be in this conjecture, the inhabitants of this island have never derived from it those advantages which have immortalized the papyrus of Egypt. They have not made that celebrated paper, quo usu maxime humanitas, vita, conflat et memoria. This remarkable expression of Pliny not only characterizes the Egyptian paper, but every kind which art and industry have substituted in its place.\n\nPAR, in Commerce, signifies any two things equal in value.

Dr Blair observes, that \"of parables, which form a part of allegory, the prophetic writings are full; and if to us they sometimes appear obscure, we must remember, that in those early times it was universally the mode throughout all the eastern nations to convey sacred truths under mysterious figures and representations.\"\n\nPARABOLA.

He was educated with great care by his father, who was the natural son of a prince, and in a little time made a great progress in the study of physic. He afterwards travelled into France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, in order to become acquainted with the most celebrated physicians. At his return to Switzerland, he stopped at Basel, where he read lectures on physic in the German tongue. He was one of the first who made use of chemical remedies with success, by which he acquired a very great reputation. Paracelsus gloried in destroying the method established by Galen, which he believed to be very uncertain; and by this means drew upon himself the hatred of the other physicians. It is said, that he boasted of being able, by his remedies, to preserve the life of man for several ages; but he himself experienced the vanity of his promises, by his dying at Salzburg, in 1544, at 37 years of age according to some, and at 48 according to others.

It has been placed in the third heaven, in the orb of the moon, in the moon itself, in the middle region of the air, above the earth, under the earth, in the place possessed by the Caipian sea, and under the arctic pole. The learned Huetius places it upon the river that is produced by the conjunction of the Tigris and Euphrates, now called the river of the Arabs, between this conjunction and the division made by the same river before it falls into the Persian sea. Other geographers have placed it in Armenia, between the sources of the Tigris, the Euphrates, the Araxes, and the Phasis, which they suppose to be the four rivers described.\nParadise, described by Moses. But concerning the exact place we must necessarily be very uncertain, if indeed it can be thought at all to exist at present, considering the many changes which have taken place on the surface of the earth since the creation.\n\n\"Learned men (says Mr Miln *) have laboured to find out the situation of Paradise, which seems to be but a vague and uncertain inquiry; for the Mosaic description of it will not fix any place on the present globe. He mentions two rivers in its vicinity, viz. Pison and Gihon, of which no vestiges can now be found. The other two still remain, viz. the Hiddekel, supposed to be the Tigris, and the Euphrates, whose streams unite together at a considerable distance above the Persian gulf; in some part of which, it is highly probable the happy garden once lay (A). This gulf is eastward both of the land of Midian and the wilderness of Sinai; in one of which places Moses wrote his history. But since the formation of this earth, it has undergone great changes from earthquakes, inundations, and many other causes. The garden, however, seems to have been a peninsula, for the way or entrance into it is afterwards mentioned. We are told that a river went out of it, which, according to some, should be rendered 'run on the outside of it,' and thus gave it the form of a horseshoe: for had the Euphrates run through the middle of the garden, one half of it would have been useless to Adam, without a bridge or boat wherewith to have crossed it.\"\n\nThe learned authors of the Universal History, in their account of rarities natural and artificial in Syria, mention \"a spot which is still shown as the place where once stood the garden of Eden, or Terrestrial Paradise. And indeed it is in all respects so beautiful and rich, and yields so delightful a prospect from the adjacent hills, that there is hardly another place in the world that has a fairer title to the name it bears. Its proximity to Damascus, the capital of Syria, near the fountain head of the Jordan; its situation between the Tigris or Hiddekel, the Euphrates, the Phasis or Phison, the Araxes or Gihon (which last has those names from its vast rapidity above all other known rivers), its bordering upon the land of Chus, famed for its fine gold; all these and many other marks specified by Moses, together with its charming and surprising fruitfulness, and constant verdure, have induced a great number of commentators to settle that celebrated and so much sought-after spot here, and to deem it the most valuable of all the natural rarities of this country.\n\nChristians, we presume, need not be told, that however curious or amusing this inquiry may be, the determination of it is of no importance, since we are all well assured that the celestial paradise is that place of pure and refined delight in which the souls of the blest enjoy everlasting happiness.\n\nIt may not be improper, however, in this place to give a description of the paradise of the Mohammedans. The sensuality and absurdity of that impostor must be apparent to all men. Their religion has no consistency in its parts, and the descriptions of the future enjoyments of the faithful are miserable imitations of human weaknesses and folly.\n\n\"The paradise of the Mohammedans is said by them to be situated above the seven heavens, or in the seventh, and next under the throne of God; and to express the amenity of the place, they tell us that the earth of it is of the finest wheat flour, or of the purest musk, or of saffron; and that its stones are pearls and jacinths, the walls of its buildings enriched with gold and silver, and the trunks of all its trees of gold, amongst which the most remarkable is the tree tuba, or tree of happiness. They pretend that this tree stands in the palace of Mohammed, though a branch of it will reach to the house of every true believer, loaded with pomegranates, dates, grapes, and other fruits of surprising bigness, and delicious tastes, unknown to mortals. If a man desires to eat of any particular kind of fruit, it will immediately be presented to him; or if he chooses flesh, birds ready dressed will be set before him, and such as he may wish for. They add, that this tree will supply the blest, not only with fruit, but with silk garments also, and beasts to ride on, adorned with rich trappings, all which will burst forth from the fruit; and that the tree is so large, that a person mounted on the fleetest horse would not be able to gallop from one end of its shade to the other in 100 years. Plenty of water being one of the greatest additions to the pleasures of any place, the Alcoran often speaks of the rivers of paradise as the principal ornament. Some of these rivers are said to flow with water, some with milk, some with wine, and others with honey: all of them have their sources in the root of this tree of happiness; and, as if these rivers were not sufficient, we are told that the garden of this paradise is also watered by a great number of lesser springs and fountains, whose pebbles are rubies and emeralds, their earth of camphor, their beds of musk, and their sides of saffron. But all these glories will be eclipsed by the resplendent and exquisite beauty of the girls of paradise, the enjoyment of whose company will constitute the principal felicity of the faithful. These (they say) are not formed of clay, as mortal women, but of pure musk; and are, as their prophet often affirms in his Alcoran, free from all the natural defects and inconveniences incident to the sex. Being also of the strictest\n\n(A) \"God (we are told) placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. In Scripture, the extraordinary judgements of God are said to be executed by his angels, who are sometimes compared to flames of fire. Therefore the cherubim and the flaming sword may probably mean nothing more than that a large portion of ground on the eastward of Paradise was set on fire during the above awful occasion, and continued burning with such violence, that the flame thereof at a distance appeared like a brandished sword, turning every way with the wind. Now if the soil of Eden was bituminous, like that of Gomorrah (which was once so fertile as to be compared to the 'garden of the Lord'), the fire would continue burning till it produced the same effect in the one place as it did in the other, and turned a great part of that tract into sea: which seems to countenance the opinion of those who place the situation of Paradise in some part of the Persian gulf.\"\nstrictest modesty, they keep themselves secluded from public view in pavilions of hollow pearls, so large, that, as some traditions have it, one of them will be no less than 16, or, as others say, 60 miles long, and as many broad. With these the inhabitants of paradise may taste pleasures in their height; and for this purpose will be endowed with extraordinary abilities, and enjoy a perpetual youth.\"\n\nParadise Lost, the name of a modern epic poem, the first and finest of those composed by Milton.\n\nThe subject of this poem is extraordinary; it had never before been attempted, and seemed to be above the efforts of human genius. Angels and devils are not the machinery, but the principal actors in it; so that what would appear marvellous in any other composition, is in this only the natural course of events.—The poet's intention was, as he expresses himself, to vindicate the ways of God to men. How far Milton was happy in the choice of his subject, may be questioned. It has led him into difficult ground, though it certainly suited the daring sublimity of his genius. It is a subject for which he alone was fitted; and, in the conduct of it, he has shown a stretch both of imagination and invention which is perfectly wonderful.\n\nBird of Paradise. See the following article.\n\nParadisea, a genus of birds belonging to the order of picae. See Ornithology Index.\n\nParadox, παράδοξον, in philosophy, a proposition seemingly absurd, as being contrary to some received opinions, but yet true in fact.\n\nThe vulgar and illiterate take almost every thing, even the most important, upon the authority of others, without ever examining it themselves. Although this implicit confidence is seldom attended with any bad consequences in the common affairs of life, it has nevertheless, in other things, been much abused; and in political and religious matters has produced fatal effects. On the other hand, knowing and learned men, to avoid this weakness, have fallen into the contrary extreme: some of them believe every thing to be unreasonable or impossible, that appears to their first apprehension; not averting to the narrow limits of the human understanding, and the infinite variety of objects, with their mutual operations, combinations, and affections, that may be presented to it.\n\nIt must be owned, that credulity has done much more mischief in the world than incredulity has done, or ever will do; because the influences of the latter extend only to such as have some share of literature, or affect the reputation thereof. And since the human mind is not necessarily impelled, without evidence, either to belief or unbelief, but may suspend its assent to, or dissent from, any proposition, till after a thorough examination; it is to be wished that men of learning, especially philosophers, would not hastily, and by the first appearances, determine themselves with respect to the truth or falsehood, possibility or imposibility of things:\n\nA person who has made but little progress in the mathematics, though in other respects learned and judicious, would be apt to pronounce it impossible that two lines, which were nowhere two inches asunder, may continually approach towards one another, and yet never meet though continued to infinity; and yet the truth of this proposition may be easily demonstrated. And many, who are good mechanics, would be as apt to pronounce the same, if they were told, that though the teeth of one wheel should take equally deep into the teeth of three others, it should affect them in such a manner, that, in turning it any way round its axis, it should turn one of them the same way, another the contrary way, and the third no way at all.\n\nNo science abounds more with paradoxes than geometry: thus, that a right line should continually approach to the hyperbola, and yet never reach it, is a true paradox; and in the same manner a spiral may continually approach to a point, and yet not reach it in any number of revolutions, however great.\n\nThe Copernican system is a paradox to the common people; but the learned are all agreed as to its truth. Geometricians have of late been accused of maintaining paradoxes; and some do indeed use very mysterious terms in expressing themselves about asymptotes, the sums of infinite proportions, the areas comprehended between curves and their asymptotes, and the folds generated from these areas, the length of some spirals, &c. But all these paradoxes and mysteries amount to no more than this; that the line or number may be continually acquiring increments, and those increments may decrease in such a manner, that the whole line or number shall never amount to a given line or number. The necessity of admitting it is obvious from the nature of the most common geometrical figures: thus, while the tangent of a circle increases, the area of the corresponding sector increases, but never amounts to a quadrant. Neither is it difficult to conceive, that if a figure be concave towards a base, and have an asymptote parallel to the base (as it happens when we take a parallel to the asymptote of the logarithmic curve, or of the hyperbola, for a base), that the ordinate in this case always increases while the base is produced, but never amounts to the distance between the asymptote and the base. In like manner, a curvilinear area may increase while the base is produced, and approach continually to a certain finite space, but never amount to it; and a fold may increase in the same manner, and yet never amount to a given fold.

This country was first discovered by Sebastian Cabot, who, in 1526, sailed from Rio de la Plata to the river Parana in small barks, and thence entered the river called Uruguay. It was not, however, thoroughly reduced till the Jesuits obtained possession of it. A few of these went to Paraguay soon after the city of Assumption was founded, and converted about 50 Indian families, who soon induced many others to follow their example, on account of the peace and tranquility they enjoyed under the fathers. They had long resisted the Spaniards and Portuguese; but the Jesuits, by learning their language, conforming to their manners &c., soon acquired great authority among them; till at last, by steadily pursuing the same artful measures, they arrived at the highest degree of power and influence, being in a manner the absolute sovereigns of a great part of this extensive country; for above 350,000 families are said to have been subject to them, living in obedience and awe bordering on adoration, yet procured without the least violence or constraint.\n\nWe have the following particular account of the missions of Paraguay, in the words of Don Jorge Juan, &c.\n\n\"The territories of the missions of Paraguay comprehend not only the province of that name, but also a great part of the provinces of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Tucuman, and Buenos Ayres. The temperature (A) of the air is good, though somewhat moist, and in some parts rather cold: the soil in many places is fertile (B); and produces in great abundance not only the fruits and vegetables peculiar to America, but also those of Europe which have been introduced there. The chief articles of their commerce are cotton, tobacco, some sugar, and the herb called Paraguay. Every town gathers annually more than 2000 arrobas of cotton, of a quarter of an hundred weight each, which the Indians manufacture into stuffs. There are also great quantities of tobacco produced. But the chief article is the herb Paraguay:\n\n(A) The climate of Paraguay differs but little from that of Spain; and the distinctions between the seasons are much the same. In winter, indeed, violent tempests of wind and rain are very frequent, accompanied with such dreadful claps of thunder and lightning as fill the inhabitants, though used to them, with terror and consternation. In summer, the excessive heats are mitigated by gentle breezes, which constantly begin at eight or nine in the morning.\n\n(B) It produces maize, manioc, and potatoes, besides many fruits and simples unknown in Europe. Wines, however, do not thrive, except in some particular places. Wheat has also been tried; but it is only used for cakes, and other things of that kind. There are great numbers of poisonous serpents; and others of enormous size, many of which live on fish. It produces also abundance of sugar, indigo, pimento, ipecacuanha, and variety of other drugs; and above all the herb Paraguay, which it exports to the value of 100,000l. annually, to the provinces of Chili and Peru. It is the leaf of a middle-sized tree, resembling an orange tree, in taste not unlike mallow. There are three gatherings: first, the buds before it unfolds its leaves, which is the best, but soonest subject to decay; the second gathering is the full grown leaves at the first expansion; the third is when the leaves have remained on some time after they are full blown. The leaves are rolled, and then kept in pits dug in the ground to be ready for sale. These trees grow principally in the morales on the east side of Paraguay, but now are distributed all over the country. The manner of using it is, to dry and reduce it almost to powder, then put it into a cup with lemon juice and sugar; boiling water is then poured on it, and the liquor drank as soon as may be. It is supposed to be serviceable in all disorders of the head, breast, and stomach, it preserves the miners from the noxious mineral steams with which they would otherwise be suffocated; is a sovereign remedy in putrid fevers and the scurvy; allays hunger; and purifies all kind of water, by infusing it therein. The country is diversified with forests, mountains, low lands (great part of the year under water), fertile meadows, and morales. Almost every forest abounds with bees, which have their hives in hollow trees. Besides cotton, the country produces hemp, flax, corn, rice, and wool; and there are such numbers of wild cattle, that they are killed only for their hides. The natives differ not materially from those described under the article AMERICA.\"\nThe missions of Paraguay are surrounded on all sides with wild or unconverted Indians; some of whom live in friendship with the towns, but others harass them by frequent incursions. The fathers frequently visit these Indians, and preach to them; and from these expeditions they seldom return without bringing along with them some new converts to incorporate with their civilized subjects. In the performance of this duty they sometimes penetrate 100 leagues into those uncultivated tracts where wild Indians range; and it is observed that they meet with the least success amongst those nations with whom any fugitive Metis, or Spanish criminals, have taken refuge. The diligence of these fathers is certainly worthy the imitation of the Protestant clergy.\n\nEvery town has its curate, who is assisted by one, and very often by two priests of the same order, according to the largeness and extent of the town and its district. These two or three priests, together with five boys who assist them in the service of the church, form a small college in every town, wherein the hours and other exercises are regulated with the same formality and exactness as in the large colleges in the cities of Peru and Chili. The most troublesome part of the duty of the assistant priests are the personal visits which they are obliged to make to the Indians to prevent their giving themselves up to idleness; for such is the slothfulness of the Guarani, that if they were not very carefully looked after, the society would receive no benefit or advantage from them. They also attend the public shambles, where the cattle necessary for the sustenance of the Indians are daily slaughtered, and distribute the flesh amongst all the families in the town, in proportion to the number of persons thereof each family consists; so that all may have what is necessary, none what is superfluous. They also visit the sick, and see that they are properly taken care of. They are generally employed the whole day in these affairs, so that they have seldom time to assist the curate in his spiritual functions. All the boys and girls in the parish go to church every day in the week (except on festivals and Sundays), where they are instructed by the curate. On Sundays the whole parish goes to church to be instructed. The curate is besides obliged to go to confess the sick, and to administer the viaticum to those who desire it, and also to perform all the other functions peculiar to this office. In sicknesses the curate should be appointed in this manner. The society should nominate three persons to the governor of Buenos Ayres (in whose government the missions of Paraguay are included), as being vice patron of the missions, that he may choose one of them for curate; and the curates should be instructed in the duties of their office by the bishop; but as the provincials of the order can best judge who are properly qualified for the office, the governor and bishop have ceded their rights to them, and by them the curates are always appointed. The missions of the Guarani and the missions of the Chiquitos, into which the missions of Paraguay are divided, have each their distinct father-superior, by whom the coadjutors or assistant curates of the several towns in the respective divisions are appointed. These Paraguay superiors are continually visiting the towns, to see that they be well governed, and to endeavour to improve and augment them. They likewise from time to time take care to send out some fathers of the order into the countries of the wild Indians to make new converts. The better to enable him to discharge these duties, the superior of the Guarani is assisted by two vice superiors; one of whom resides in Parana, the other upon the banks of the river Uruguay, and the superior himself resides in the town of Candelaria. The post of superior of the Chiquitos is not nearly so troublesome as that of the superior of the Guarani; for the Chiquitos are not only less numerous, but much more docile and industrious than the Guarani, so that they need not be continually watched, and attended in order to prevent their idleness. The king allows an annual stipend of 300 pezas to each curate of the Guarani, for the maintenance of himself and his assistants. The money is paid to the superior, who issues it monthly to each curate as much as is necessary for his subsistence; and when they want anything extraordinary, their wants are supplied upon application to him. But the Chiquitos maintain their own curates. In every town there is a plantation set apart for the maintenance of the curate, which is cultivated by the joint labour of all the inhabitants. The produce of these plantations is generally more than sufficient for the subsistence of the curates and the surplus is sold to buy ornaments for the churches. Nor are the curates the spiritual rectors of the towns only; they are also in effect the civil governors. It is true there are in every town of the missions a governor, regidores, and alcaldes, as there are in the other towns and cities under the Spanish government. But though the governor is elected by the Indians, he must be approved by the curate before he enters upon his office; nor can he chastise or punish delinquents without the curate's permission. The curate examines those who are accused of offences; and if he finds them guilty, delivers them to the governor to be punished, according to the nature and quality of the offence committed. He sometimes orders them to be imprisoned for a few days, sometimes to fast, and, when the fault is considerable, to be whipped, which is the severest punishment that is ever inflicted; for the regulations and instructions of the curates have been so efficacious, that murder and such like heinous crimes are never here committed. And even before they undergo these gentle corrections, the curate discourses the offenders in a mild friendly manner; and endeavours to excite in them a due sense of their crime, and of the ill consequences that might flow from it, and to convince them that they merit a much greater punishment than is inflicted. This mild treatment prevents tumults and insurrections, and acquires the curates universal veneration and esteem. The alcaldes are chosen annually by the regidores. The governor, regidores, and alcaldes are all Indians of the best capacities; and are in effect only so many overseers appointed by the curate, and dignified with these empty titles (c).\n\nEvery town has its armory or magazine, in which are lodged\n\n(c) We call them empty titles; because in all cases the Jesuit or curate of the parish was a kind of sovereign regarded as a petty prince, and obeyed as an oracle. Whatever forms might take place in the choice of the chiefs of\nParaguay. lodged the fire-arms or other weapons wherewith the militia are armed when they take the field to repel the irruptions of the Portuguese and wild Indians. The militia are very dexterous and expert in the management of their arms; and are exercised on the eves of festivals in the squares or public places of the towns. The militia is composed of all those who are able to bear arms: they are formed into companies, which have each a proper number of officers chosen from amongst those who are most distinguished for judgement and conduct. The chiefs of the officers is rich, adorned with gold and silver, and the device of the town to which they belong: they always appear in their uniforms on festivals, and on the days of military exercise. The governor, alcaldes, and regidores have also proper robes and dresses suitable to their respective offices, in which they appear on public occasions. There are schools in every town, in which the common people are taught reading and writing, and also music and dancing; in which arts they become very skilful. The Jesuits are very careful in confining the natural bent and genius of their scholars, and in directing their studies and application accordingly. The leads of the most promising genius are taught the Latin tongue with great success. In one of the court-yards of every curate's house are various shops or workhouses of painters, carvers, gilders, silversmiths, carpenters, weavers, and clockmakers, and of several other mechanics and artisans, who daily work for the public under the direction of the coadjutors, and at the same time teach the youth their respective arts and occupations.\n\nThe churches are large, well built, finely decorated and enlightened, and not inferior to the richest in Peru. Each church has a choir of music, composed of instruments of all sorts, and very good voices; so that divine service is celebrated here with as much pomp and solemnity as in cathedrals: nor are the public processions less splendid, especially that of the holy; which, whenever it is carried abroad, is attended by the governor, alcaldes, and regidores, in their robes, and also by the militia in a body. The houses of the Indians are as well built and as well furnished as most of the Spanish houses in Peru. The greatest part indeed have mud walls, others are built with brick, and some with stone, but all are covered with tiles. In every town there is a house where gunpowder is made, that they may never want it when they are obliged to take arms, and always have it ready to make artificial fireworks on rejoicing days: for all festivals are here observed with as great ceremony and exactness as in the greatest cities. Upon the proclamation of a new king of Spain, the governors, alcaldes, regidores, and officers of the militia, appear draped in new robes and uniforms of a different fashion from those they wore before. There is a fort of convent in every town; in one part whereof are confined women of an ill life, and the other part is destined for the reception of married women who have no family, and who retire thither when their husbands are absent. For the maintenance of this house, and for the support of orphans, and of old and infirm people, all the inhabitants of the town work two days in every week; and the profits of their labour, which is called the labour of the community, are set apart for the purpose. If the produce of this labour be more than is necessary for their subsistence, the surplus is laid out to buy ornaments for the churches, and clothes for the orphans and aged and infirm people; so that here are no beggars, nor any who want the necessaries of life. In short, by the wise policy and prudent regulations of the Jesuits, the whole community enjoys peace and happiness.\n\n\"The Guaranes are so profuse and negligent, that the curates are obliged to take into their hands all their goods and stuffs as soon as they are manufactured and made ready for sale; otherwise they would waste and destroy them, and not be able to maintain themselves. The Chiquitos, on the contrary, are diligent and frugal; so that the curates have no other trouble with them than assisting them in the disposal of their goods, and procuring returns for them. For this purpose the society keeps a factor or procurator at Santa Fé and Buenos Ayres, to whom the merchandise of the missions is sent to be disposed of; and these factors return the value to the fathers in such sorts of European commodities as are wanted. The goods of every town are kept separate; and the royal taxes are taken out of them without any other discounts or allowances, save the stipends of the curates of the Guaranes and the pensions of the caciques. The fathers choose to manage the commerce of their subjects themselves, lest they should contract vices by their communication with other people. In this respect the fathers are so careful, that they will not suffer any of the people of Peru, whether they be Spaniards, Mestizos, or Indians, to enter into the territories of the missions. They say that the Indians are but just recovered from a barbarous and dissolute way of life, and that their manners are now pure and innocent; but that if strangers were suffered to come among them, the Indians would soon get acquainted with people of loose lives: and as the Guaranes especially are very prone to vice, wickedness, disorder, and rebellion would soon be introduced; the society would lose all the souls they have converted; and their little republic would be utterly subverted. However, there are some who suspect that these are all specious pretences; and that the society's real motive for prohibiting all intercourse with strangers, is the fear of rivals in the beneficial commerce of Paraguay, which is now entirely in their hands.\"\n\nSuch is the account they themselves have given us of their own conduct: but others have treated their characters with more severity; accusing them of pride, haughtiness, and abusing their authority to the greatest degree; inasmuch that they would have caused the magistrates to be whipped in their presence, and obliged persons of the highest distinction within their jurisdiction to kiss the hem of their garment, as the greatest honour at which they could possibly arrive. To this might be added, the utter abolition of all ideas of property; which indeed was rendered\n\nthe federal departments, their success ultimately depended on him. The cacique held of him; the general received his commission and instructions from him; and all his decisions were without appeal. There were, we are informed, not less than 600 parishes on the banks of the rivers Uruguay and Parana, not exceeding the distance of 30 miles from each other; in each of which was a Jesuit or curate.\nPARALLACTIC, in general, something relating to the parallax of heavenly bodies. See PARALLAX.\n\nPARALLAX, in Astronomy, is the difference between the places of any celestial object as seen from the surface, and from the centre of the earth at the same instant.\n\nLet E in figure of parallax, represent the centre of the earth, O the place of an observer on its surface, whose visible horizon is OH, and true horizon EF: Now let ZDT be a portion of a great circle in the heavens, and A the place of any object in the visible horizon; join EA, and produce it to C; then C is the true place of the object, and H is its apparent place, and the angle CAH is the parallax; or, because the object is in the horizon, it is called the horizontal parallax. But OAE, the angle which the earth's radius subtends at the object, is equal to CAH: Hence the horizontal parallax of an object may be defined to be the angle which the earth's semidiameter subtends at that object. For the various methods hitherto proposed to find the quantity of the horizontal parallax of an object, see Astronomy.\n\nThe whole effect of parallax is in a vertical direction: For the parallactic angle is in the plane passing through the observer and the earth's centre; which plane is necessarily perpendicular to the horizon, the earth being considered a sphere.\n\nThe more elevated an object is above the horizon, the less is the parallax, its distance from the earth's centre continuing the same. When the object is in the zenith, it has no parallax; but when in the horizon, its parallax is greatest. The horizontal parallax being given, the parallax at any given altitude may be found by the following rule:\n\nTo the logarithmic cofine of the given altitude, add the log. fine of the horizontal parallax, the sum, rejecting 10 from the index, will be the log. fine of the parallax in altitude.\n\nDemonstration. Let B be the place of an object; produce OB, ED to F and D; then the angle BOZ will be the apparent altitude of the object, BEZ the true altitude, and OBE the parallax in altitude. Now in the radius of the triangle AOE,\n\n\\[ R : \\text{fine } OAE :: EA : EO. \\]\n\nAnd in the triangle OBE\n\n\\[ BE (=EA) : EO :: \\text{fine } BOE : \\text{fine } OBE. \\]\n\nHence \\( r : \\text{cofine } BOA :: \\text{fine } OAE : \\text{fine } OBE. \\)\n\nAs the two last terms are generally small quantities, the arch may be substituted in place of its fine without any sensible error.\n\nExample. Let the apparent altitude of the moon's centre be \\(39^\\circ 25'\\), and the moon's horizontal parallax \\(56' 54''\\). Required the parallax in altitude.\n\nMoon's apparent alt. \\(39^\\circ 25'\\) cofine \\(9.8879260\\)\nMoon's horizontal par. \\(56' 54''\\) fine \\(8.2188186\\)\n\nMoon's par. in altitude \\(43' 57''\\) fine \\(8.1067446\\)\n\nOr, to the secant of the moon's apparent altitude, add the proportional logarithms of the parallax in altitude.\n\nAs the apparent place of an object is nearer the horizon than its true place, the parallax is therefore to be added to the apparent altitude, to obtain the true altitude. Hence also an object will appear to rise later and set sooner.\nThe fine of the parallax of an object is inversely as its distance from the earth's centre.\n\n**Demonstration.** Let A be the place of an object and H the place of the same object at another time, or that of another object at the same instant; join EH, then in the triangles AOE, HOE,\n\n\\[ R : \\text{fine } OAE :: AE : OE \\]\n\\[ \\text{fine } OHE : R :: OE : EH \\]\n\nHence fine OHE : fine OAE :: AE : EH.\n\nThe parallax of an object makes it appear more distant from the meridian than it really is.\n\n**Demonstration.** The true and apparent places of an object are in the same vertical, the apparent place being lower than the true; and all verticals meet at the zenith: Hence the apparent place of an object is more distant from the plane of the meridian than the true place.\n\nThe longitude, latitude, right ascension, and declination of an object are affected by a parallax. The difference between the true and apparent longitudes is called the *parallax in longitude*; in like manner, the difference between the true and apparent latitudes, right ascensions, and declinations, are called the *parallax in latitude*, *right ascension*, and *declination*, respectively.\n\nWhen the object is in the nonagefmal, the parallax in longitude is nothing, but that in latitude is greatest; and when the object is in the meridian, the parallax in right ascension vanishes, and that in declination is a maximum. The apparent longitude is greater than the true longitude, when the object is east of the nonagefmal, otherwise less; and when the object is in the eastern hemisphere, the apparent right ascension exceeds the true, but is less than the true right ascension when the object is in the western hemisphere. The apparent place of an object is more distant from the elevated poles of the ecliptic and equator than the true place: hence, when the latitude of the place and elevated pole of the ecliptic are of the same name, the apparent latitude is less than the true latitude, otherwise greater; and the apparent declination will be less or greater than the true declination, according as the latitude of the place, and declination of the object, are of the same or of a contrary denomination.\n\nThe parallaxes in longitude, latitude, right ascension, and declination, in the spheroidal hypothesis, may be found by the following formulae; in which L represents the latitude of the place, diminished by the angle contained between the vertical and radius of the given place; P the horizontal parallax for that place; a the altitude of the nonagefmal at the given instant; d the apparent distance of the object from the nonagefmal; \\( r \\) the true and apparent latitudes of the object; \\( D \\) the true and apparent declinations respectively; and \\( m \\) its apparent distance from the meridian.\n\nThen par. in long. \\( = P \\cdot \\text{fine } a \\cdot \\text{fine } d \\cdot \\text{secant } l \\), to radius unity; and par. in lat. \\( = P \\cdot \\text{cofine } a \\cdot \\text{cofine } \\lambda \\)\n\n\\[\n\\lambda = p \\cdot \\text{cofine } d \\cdot \\text{fine } a \\cdot \\text{fine } \\lambda\n\\]\n\nThe sign \\( - \\) is used when the apparent distance of the object from the nonagefmal and from the elevated pole of the ecliptic are of the same affection, and the sign \\( + \\) if of different affection. If the greatest precision be required, the following quantity \\( 0.0000121216 \\) is to be applied to the parallax in latitude found as above, by addition or subtraction, according as the true distance of the object from the elevated pole of the ecliptic is greater or less than \\( 90^\\circ \\).\n\nAgain, par. in right ascen. \\( = P \\cdot \\text{cofine } L \\cdot \\text{fine } m \\)\nsecant \\( D \\), to radius unity; and par. in declination \\( = P \\cdot \\text{fine } L \\cdot \\text{cofine } 2 \\cdot \\text{cofine } L \\cdot \\text{cofine } \\lambda \\), cofine \\( m \\).\n\nThe upper or lower sign is to be used, according as the distance of the object from the meridian and from the elevated pole of the equator are of the same or different affection. Part 2d of par. in declination \\( = 0.0000121216 \\) par. in right ascen. \\( ^2 \\), fine \\( 2D \\); which is additive to, or subtractive from, part first of parallax in declination, according as the true distance of the object from the elevated pole of the equator is greater or less than \\( 90^\\circ \\). For the moon's parallax, see Astronomy.\n\nThere is also a curious paper in the first volume of Asiatic Researches, p. 372, &c., on the same subject, to which we refer our readers.\n\n**Parallax of the Earth's annual Orbit**, is the difference between the places of a planet as seen from the sun and earth at the same instant. The difference between the longitudes of the planet as seen from the sun and earth is called the *parallax in longitude*; and the difference between its latitudes is the *parallax in latitude*.\n\n**Parallax of the Fixed Stars**, see Astronomy, art. 268, which contains an account of the method used by Dr Herschel, to ascertain the parallax of a star which appears to be double, from observations made at opposite points of the orbit of the earth. M. Piazzi, the discoverer of the planet Ceres, has made many observations of the zenith distances of \\( \\alpha \\) Lyrae, Arcturus, Procyon, and Aquila, &c., at those times when the effects of parallax ought to be the greatest. His observations are published in the 10th volume of the Italian Society. Let \\( p \\) be the absolute parallax, consequently,\n\n\\[\n\\text{fine } p = \\frac{\\text{distance of the star from the earth}}{I}\n\\]\n\nthen the parallax of Arcturus in declination will be \\( 0.595p \\); and that in right ascension, \\( 1.005p \\); hence, he observes, that observations of the right ascension of this star are preferable to those of the declination, for determining the parallax of this star.\n\nM. Calendrelli, in a work printed at Rome in 1836, has given the result of his observations of the zenith distances of \\( \\alpha \\) Lyrae, made with the sector of Meffl. Maire and Bolcovich. By comparing five observations in June, with four in December 1835, and five in March with the same number in June, he deduced the parallax of \\( \\alpha \\) Lyrae in declination to be \\( 4'' \\), and that in right ascension \\( 6.8'' \\). According to M. Piazzi, the parallax is less than half of these quantities; and, hence, the required quantity not exceeding the unavoidable differences attending observations, it appears difficult to determine it, so as to be free from doubt.\n\nMeffl. Delambre and Mechain have made many observations of the pole star, and \\( \\beta \\) Ursae minoris, being those stars which ought to have the greatest parallax in declination, at the times most proper to discover their parallax; but from the comparison, which M. Delambre made, of the zenith distances of these stars, he discovered nothing that could give the least suspicion of a parallax; and the small anomalies which he observed are often in a contrary direction. M. Delambre adds,\nParallax that these stars being of the second magnitude, may be too far distant from us to have a parallax; however, although this may be the case, yet it appears to him that the fixed stars have no parallax.\n\nThe parallax of Venus affords the most correct method, hitherto proposed, of finding the distance of the earth from the sun; and, hence, the distances of the other planets, and also their magnitudes. For this discovery we are indebted to the celebrated Dr Halley. From observations of the transits of this planet, in 1761 and 1769, the parallax of the sun has been more accurately determined than previous thereto. The parallax of Mars has also been employed for the same purpose.\n\nParallax is also used to denote the change of place in any object arising from viewing it obliquely with respect to another object. Thus the minute hand of a watch is said to have a parallax when it is viewed obliquely; and the difference between the images shown by it, when viewed directly and obliquely, is the quantity of parallax in time.\n\nParallel, in Geometry, an appellation given to lines, surfaces, and bodies, everywhere equidistant from each other.

See Surinam.\n\nParamount, (compounded of two French words, par, i.e. per, and monter, ascender), signifies in our law the \"highest lord of the fee, of lands, tenements, and hereditaments.\" As there may be a lord whose where lands are held of an inferior lord, who holds them of a superior under certain services; so this superior lord is lord paramount. Also the king is the chief lord, or lord paramount of all the lands in the kingdom. Co.

As the paranymph officiated only on the part of the bridegroom, a woman called pronuba officiated on the part of the bride.\n\nParapet, in Fortification, an elevation of earth designed for covering the soldiers from the enemy's cannon or small shot. See Fortification.\n\nParaphernalia, or Parapherna, in the civil law, those goods which a wife brings her husband besides her dower, and which are still to remain at her disposal exclusive of her husband, unless there is some provision made to the contrary in the marriage contract. Some of our English civilians define the paraphernalia to be such goods as a wife challengeth over and above her dower or jointure, after her husband's death; as furniture for her chamber, wearing apparel, and jewels, which are not to be put into the inventory of her husband's goods; and a French civilian calls paraphernalia the movables, linen, and other female necessaries, which are adjudged to a wife in prejudice of the creditors, when she renounces the succession of her husband.\n\nParaphimosis, a disorder of the penis, wherein the prepuce is shrunk, and withdrawn behind the glans, so as not to be capable of being brought to cover the same; which generally happens in venereal disorders.

The Romans more frequently called it Pofficenium. See Theatre.\n\nParaseleene, in Natural Philosophy, a mock moon; a meteor or phenomenon encompassing or adjacent to the moon, in form of a luminous ring; wherein are observed sometimes one and sometimes two or more images of the moon.\n\nParasemon, among the Greeks, was the figure carved on the prow of the ships to distinguish them from each other. This figure was generally that of a bull, lion, or other animal; sometimes the representation of a mountain, tree, flower, &c.\n\nParasite, among the Greeks, was originally a very reputable title; the parasites being a kind of priests, at least ministers, of the gods, in the same manner as the epulones were at Rome. They took care of the sacred corn, or the corn destined for the service of the temples and the gods, viz. sacrifices, feasts, &c. They had\nParasites had even the intendment over sacrifices; and took care that they were duly performed. At Athens there was a kind of college of twelve parasites; each people of Attica furnishing one, who was always chosen out of the best families. Polybius adds, that a parasite was also an honourable title among the ancient Gauls, and was given to their poets. But of late it has been made a term of reproach, and used for a flatterer or mean dependent.\n\nPARASITES, or PARASITICAL Plants, in Botany, such plants as are produced out of the trunk or branches of other plants, from whence they receive their nourishment, and will not grow on the ground.

Hence the poets tell us, the Parcae spun the thread of men's lives; that Clotho held the distaff, and drew the thread; Lachesis twirled the spindle, and spun it; and Atropos cut it. Clotho colum retinet, Lachesis net, Atropos fecat.\n\nThe ancients represent the Parcae divers ways: Lucian, in the shape of three poor old women, having large locks of wool, mixed with daffodils on their heads; one of which holds a distaff, the other a wheel, and the third a pair of scissors, wherewith to cut the thread of life. Others represent them otherwise: Clotho appearing in a long robe of divers colours, wearing a crown upon her head adorned with seven flares, and holding a distaff in her hand; Lachesis in a robe befit with stars, with several spindles in her hand; and Atropos, clad in black, cutting the thread with a pair of large scissors.\n\nThe ancients imagined that the Parcae used white wool for a long and happy life, and black for a short and unfortunate one. See Necesity, in Mythology.\n\nPARCHMENT, the skins of sheep or goats prepared after such a manner as to render it proper for writing upon, covering books, &c.\n\nThe word comes from the Latin pergamenæ, the ancient name of this manufacture; which is said to have been taken from the city Pergamos, to Eumenes king whereof its invention is usually ascribed; though, in reality, that prince appears rather to have been the improver than the inventor of parchment. For the Persians of old, according to Diodorus, wrote all their records on skins; and the ancient Ionians, as we are told by Herodotus, made use of sheep skins and goat skins in writing, many ages before Eumenes's time. Nor need we doubt that such skins were prepared and dressed for that purpose, after a manner not unlike that of our parchment; though probably not so artificially.—The manufacture of parchment is begun by the skinner, and finished by the parchment maker.\n\nThe skin having been stripped of its wool, and placed in the lime pit, in the manner described under the article SHAMMY, the skinner stretches it on a kind of frame, and pares off the flesh with an iron instrument; this done, it is moistened with a rag; and powdered chalk being spread over it, the skinner takes a large pumice stone, flat at bottom, and rubs over the skin, and thus scours off the flesh; he then goes over it again with an iron instrument, moistens it as before, and rubs it again with the pumice stone without any chalk underneath: this smooths and softens the flesh side very considerably. He then drains it again, by passing over it the iron instrument as before. The flesh side being thus drained, by scraping off the moisture, he in the same manner passes the iron over the wool or hair side: then stretches it on a frame, and scrapes the flesh side again: this finishes its draining; and the more it is drained the whiter it becomes. The skinner now throws on more chalk, sweeping it over with a piece of lamb skin that has the wool on; and this smooths it still farther. It is now left to dry, and when dried, taken off the frame by cutting it all round. The skin thus far prepared by the skinner, is taken out of his hands by the parchment maker, who first, while it is dry, pares it on a summer, (which is a calf skin stretched in a frame), with a sharper instrument than that used by the skinner; and working with the arm from the top to the bottom of the skin, takes away about one half of its thickness. The skin thus equally pared on the flesh side, is again rendered smooth, by being rubbed with the pumice stone, on a bench covered with a sack stuffed with flocks; which leaves the parchment in a condition fit for writing upon. The parings thus taken off the leather, are used in making glue, size, &c. See the article GLUE, &c.\n\nWhat is called vellum is only parchment made of the skins of abortives, or at least sucking calves. This has a much finer grain, and is whiter and smoother than parchment; but is prepared in the same manner, except its not being passed through the lime pit.\n\nPARDALIS. See FELIS, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nPARDIES, IGNATIUS GASTON, an ingenious and learned French Jesuit, born at Paris in 1636. He taught polite literature for several years; during which time he composed several small pieces, both in prose and verse, with peculiar delicacy of thought and style. At length he devoted himself entirely to mathematics and natural philosophy, and read all authors, ancient as well as modern, in those branches of knowledge. He died in 1673, of an infectious disorder contracted by confessing and preaching to the prisoners in the Bicetre during the Easter holidays. Father Pardies published several works; of which his Elements of Geometry are well known in this country, where a translation of them has gone through several editions. In 1672 he had a dispute with Sir Isaac Newton respecting his Theory of Light and Colours; which may be seen in the Philosophical Transactions for that year.\n\nPARDON, in Criminal Law, is the remitting or forgiving an offence committed against the king.\n\nLaw (says an able writer), cannot be framed on principles of compassion to guilt; yet justice, by the constitution of England, is bound to be administered in mercy: this is promised by the king in his coronation oath; and it is that act of his government which is the most personal and most entirely his own. The king condemns no man; that rugged talk he leaves to his courts\nPardon of justice: the great operation of his sceptre is mercy. His power of pardoning was said by our Saxon ancestors to be derived à lege fæce dignitatis: and it is declared in parliament, by stat. 27 Hen. VIII. c. 24, that no other person hath power to pardon or remit any treason or felonies whatsoever; but that the king hath the whole and sole power thereof, united and knit to the imperial crown of this realm.\n\nThis is indeed one of the greatest advantages of monarchy in general above any other form of government, that there is a magistrate who has it in his power to extend mercy wherever he thinks it is deserved; holding a court of equity in his own breast, to soften the rigour of the general law, in such criminal cases as merit an exemption from punishment. Pardons (according to some theorists) should be excluded in a perfect legislature, where punishments are mild, but certain; for that the clemency of the prince seems a tacit disapprobation of the laws. But the exclusion of pardons must necessarily introduce a very dangerous power in the judge or jury; that of construing the criminal law by the spirit instead of the letter; or else it must be held, that no man will seriously avow, that the situation and circumstances of the offender (though they alter not the essence of the crime) ought to make no distinction in the punishment. In democracies, however, this power of pardon can never subsist; for there nothing higher is acknowledged than the magistrate who administers the laws; and it would be impolitic for the power of judging and of pardoning to centre in one and the same person. This (as the prescient Montefiore observes) would oblige him very often to contradict himself, to make and to unmake his decisions: it would tend to confound all ideas of right among the mass of people; as they would find it difficult to tell, whether a prisoner were discharged by his innocence, or obtained a pardon through favour. In Holland, therefore, if there be no fadholder, there is no power of pardoning lodged in any other member of the state. But in monarchies the king acts in a superior sphere; and though he regulates the whole government as the first mover, yet he does not appear in any of the disagreeable or invidious parts of it. Whenever the nation see him personally engaged, it is only in works of legislature, munificence, or compassion. To him therefore the people look up as the fountain of nothing but bounty and grace; and these repeated acts of goodness, coming immediately from his own hand, endear the sovereign to his subjects, and contribute more than anything to root in their hearts that filial affection and personal loyalty which are the sure establishment of a prince.\n\nThe king may pardon all offences merely against the crown or the public; excepting, 1. That, to preserve the liberty of the subject, the committing any man to prison out of the realm, is, by the habeas corpus act, 31 Car. II. c. 2, made a prerogative, unpardonable even by the king. Nor, 2. Can the king pardon, where private justice is principally concerned in the prosecution of offenders: Non potest rex gratiam facere cum injuria et damno aliorum. Therefore, in appeals of all kinds (which are the suit, not of the king, but of the party injured), the prosecutor may release; but the king cannot pardon. Neither can he pardon a common nuisance, while it remains unredeemed, or so as to prevent an abatement of it; though afterwards he may remit the fine; because though the prosecution is veiled in the king to avoid the multiplicity of suits, yet (during its continuance) this offence favours more of the nature of a private injury to each individual in the neighbourhood, than of a public wrong. Neither, lastly, can the king pardon an offence against a popular or penal statute, after information brought; for thereby the informer hath acquired a private property in his part of the penalty.\n\nThere is also a restriction of a peculiar nature, that affects the prerogative of pardoning, in case of parliamentary impeachments, viz. that the king's pardon cannot be pleaded to any such impeachment, so as to impede the inquiry, and stop the prosecution of great and notorious offenders. Therefore, when, in the reign of Charles II., the earl of Danby was impeached by the house of commons of high treason and other misdemeanors, and pleaded the king's pardon in bar of the same, the commons alleged, \"That there was no precedent that ever any pardon was granted to any person impeached by the commons of high treason, or other high crimes, depending the impeachment;\" and thereupon resolved, \"That the pardon so pleaded was illegal and void, and ought not to be allowed in bar of the impeachment of the commons of England;\" for which resolution they assigned this reason to the house of lords, \"That the setting up a pardon to be a bar of an impeachment defeats the whole use and effect of impeachments: for should this point be admitted, or stand doubted, it would totally discourage the exhibiting any for the future; whereby the chief institution for the preservation of the government would be destroyed.\" Soon after the Revolution, the commons renewed the same claim, and voted, \"That a pardon is not pleadable in bar of an impeachment.\" And at length, it was enacted by the act of settlement, 12 and 13 W. III. c. 2, \"That no pardon under the great seal of England shall be pleadable to an impeachment by the commons in parliament.\" But, after the impeachment has been solemnly heard and determined, it is not understood that the king's royal grace is farther restrained or abridged: for, after the impeachment and attainder of the five rebel lords in 1715, three of them were from time to time reprieved by the crown; and at length received the benefit of the king's most gracious pardon.\n\nThe effect of such pardon by the king, is to make the offender a new man; to acquit him of all corporal penalties and forfeitures annexed to that offence for which he obtains his pardon; and not too much to restore his former, as to give him a new credit and capacity. But nothing can restore or purify the blood when once corrupted, if the pardon be not allowed till after attainder, but the high and transcendant power of parliament. Yet if a person attainted receive the king's pardon, and afterwards hath a son, that son may be heir to his father; because the father being made a new man, might transmit new inheritable blood; though, had he been born before the pardon, he could never have inherited at all.\n\nSuch is the nature of pardons in this kingdom. These, like other good things, may doubtless be abused; and if they are in any instance, their abuse deserves censure: but that in their nature they should be counted absurd, arbitrary, and destructive of morality, can we suspect,\nPardon, proceed from nothing but from the presumptive petulance of modern reformers, or from the new system of civil equality.\n\nWe are told, however, by a late champion for the Rights of Man, that \"the very word to a reflecting mind is fraught with absurdity.\" What is the rule that ought in all cases to prefer itself to my conduct? Surely justice: understanding by justice the greatest utility of the whole mass of things that may be influenced by my conduct. What then is clemency? It can be nothing but the pitiable egotism of him who imagines he can do something better than justice. Is it right that I should suffer constraint for a certain offence? The rectitude of my suffering must be founded in its tendency to promote the general welfare. He therefore that pardons me, intuitively prefers the imaginary interest of an individual, and utterly neglects what he owes to the whole. He betrays that which I ought not to receive, and which he has no right to give. Is it right, on the contrary, that I should not undergo the suffering in question? Will he, by relieving me from suffering, do a benefit to me, and no injury to others? He will then be a notorious delinquent, if he allow me to suffer. There is indeed a considerable defect in this last supposition. If, while he benefits me, he do no injury to others, he is infallibly performing a public service. If I suffered in the arbitrary manner which the supposition includes, the whole would sustain an unquestionable injury in the injustice that was perpetrated. And yet the man who prevents this odious injustice, has been accustomed to arrogate to himself the attribute of clemency, and the apparently sublime, but in reality tyrannical, name of forgiveness. For, if he do more than has been here described, instead of glory he ought to take shame to himself, as an enemy to the interest of human kind. If every action, and especially every action in which the happiness of a rational being is concerned, be susceptible of a certain rule, then caprice must be in all cases excluded: there can be no action, which if I neglect, I shall have discharged my duty; and, if I perform, I shall be entitled to applause.\"\n\nSuch is the reasoning of this singular writer; reasoning which, in our opinion, betrays want of feeling or ignorance of human nature. That human nature is such as, in the aggregate, to need control, no one who is acquainted with it will deny; and there appears to be no other method of controlling mankind but by general laws; and these laws may, through the natural imperfection of human affluence, be cruel in one case, where they are just in another. Cases may likewise occur where the sentence of the law, without its execution, will answer every purpose which could be expected from it; and where the execution of it would be extreme cruelty, though it might in strict unfeeling language be called justice, because in conformity with the letter of the law: Yet though such cases may and do often occur, it would indeed be absurd to abolish any of those laws which the security of civil society has required; and therefore the only natural remedy against legal injustice is the system of pardons.\n\nOur author next goes on to trace the origin of pardons; and instead of a definite system of law, we are told that it is necessary to have a court of reason, to which the decisions of a court of law shall be brought for revial: a remedy apparently too vague and indeter-\ntaught to expect a certain desirable event; from what? From the clemency, the uncontrolled, unmerited kindness of a fellow mortal. Can any lesson be more degrading? The puffamorous fervility of the man, who devotes himself with everlasting obsequiousness to another, because that other having begun to be unjust, relents in his career; the ardour with which he confesses the rectitude of his sentence and the enormity of his defects, will constitute a tale that future ages will find it difficult to understand. What are the sentiments in this respect that are alone worthy of a rational being? Give me that, and that only, which without injustice you cannot refuse. More than justice it would be disgraceful for me to ask, and for you to bestow. I stand upon the foundation of right. This is a title which brute force may refuse to acknowledge, but which all the force in the world cannot annihilate. By refusing this plea you may prove yourself unjust, but in yielding to it you grant me but my due. If, all things considered, I be the fit subject of a benefit, the benefit is merited; merit in any other sense is contradictory and absurd. If you bestow upon me unmerited advantage, you are a recreant from the general good. I may be safe enough to thank you; but if I were virtuous, I should condemn you. These sentiments alone are consistent with true independence of mind. He that is accustomed to regard virtue as an affair of favour and grace, cannot be eminently virtuous. If he occasionally perform an action of apparent kindness, he will applaud the generosity of his sentiments; and if he abstain, he will acquit himself with the question, \"May I not do what I will with my own?\"\n\nIn the same manner, when he is treated benevolently by another, he will in the first place be unwilling to examine strictly into the reasonableness of this treatment, because benevolence, as he imagines, is not subject to any inflexibility of rule; and, in the second place, he will not regard his benefactor with that erect and unembarrassed mien, that complete sense of equality, which is the only immoveable basis of virtue and happiness.\"\n\nSuch is Mr Godwin's conclusion on this subject; and we leave it with our readers to determine, whether his system or that which we at present enjoy would be the more rigorous or unjust; or whether mankind have indeed arrived at that eminent pitch of virtue, as to disdain every favour which they do not absolutely merit.

The legal duties of parents to their legitimate children. 2. Their power over them.\n\nI. The duties of parents to legitimate children consist in three particulars; their maintenance, their protection, and their education.\n\n1. The duty of parents to provide for the maintenance of their children, is a principle of natural law; an obligation, says Puffendorff, laid on them not only by nature herself, but by their own proper act, in bringing them into the world; for they would be in the highest manner injurious to their issue, if they only gave their children life, that they might afterwards see them perish. By begetting them, therefore, they have entered into a voluntary obligation, to endeavour, as far as in them lies, that the life which they have bestowed shall be supported and preserved. And thus the children will have a perfect right of receiving maintenance from their parents. And the president Montefeuille has a very just observation upon this head, that the establishment of marriage, in all civilized states, is built on this natural obligation of the father to provide for his children; for that ascertains and makes known the person who is bound to fulfil this obligation; whereas, in promiscuous and illicit conjunctions, the father is unknown; and the mother finds a thousand obstructions in her way; shame, remorse, the constraint of her sex, and the rigour of laws, that stifle her inclinations to perform this duty; and besides, the generally wants ability.\n\nThe municipal laws of all well regulated states have taken care to enforce this duty: though Providence has done it more effectually than any laws, by implanting in the breast of every parent that natural segen, or inestimable degree of affection, which not even the deformity of person or mind, nor even the wickedness, ingratitude, and rebellion of children, can totally suppress or extinguish.\n\nThe civil law obliges the parent to provide maintenance for his child; and if he refuse, judex de ea re cognolcat. Nay, it carries this matter so far, that it will not suffer a parent at his death totally to disfranchise his child, without expressly giving his reason for so doing; and there are 14 such reasons reckoned up, which may justify such disfranchisement. If the parent alleged no reason, or a bad, or a false one, the child might set the will aside, tanquam testamentum inefficacium, a testament contrary to the natural duty of the parent. And it is remarkable under what colour the children were to move for relief in such a case; by suggesting, that the parent had lost the use of his reason when he made the inefficacious testament. And this, as Puffendorff observes, was not to bring into dispute the testator's power of disfranchising his own offspring; but to examine the motives upon which he did it; and if they were found defective in reason, then to set them aside. But perhaps this is going rather too far: every man has, or ought to have, by the laws of society, a power over his own property: and, as Grotius very well distinguishes, natural right obliges to give a nece-\nmaintenance to children; but what is more than that they have no right to, than as it is given by the favour of their parents, or the positive constitutions of the municipal law.\n\nLet us next see what provision our own laws have made for this natural duty. It is a principle of law, that there is an obligation on every man to provide for those descended from his loins; and the manner in which this obligation shall be performed, is thus pointed out. The father and mother, grandfather and grandmother, of poor impotent persons, shall maintain them at their own charges, if of sufficient ability, according as the quarter sessions shall direct; and, if a parent runs away, and leaves his children, the church wardens and overseers of the parish shall seize his rents, goods, and chattels, and dispose of them towards their relief. By the interpretations which the courts of law have made upon these statutes, if a mother or grandmother marries again, and was before such second marriage of sufficient ability to keep the child, the husband shall be charged to maintain it; for this being a debt of her's, when single, shall, like others, extend to charge the husband. But, at her death, the relation being dissolved, the husband is under no farther obligation.\n\nNo person is bound to provide a maintenance for his issue, unless where the children are impotent and unable to work, either through infancy, disease, or accident; and then is only obliged to find them with necessaries, the penalty on refusal being no more than 2s. a month. For the policy of our laws, which are ever watchful to promote industry, did not mean to compel a father to maintain his idle and lazy children in ease and indolence; but thought it unjust to oblige the parent against his will, to provide them with superfluities, and other indulgences of fortune; imagining they might trust to the impulse of nature, if the children were deserving of such favours. Yet, as nothing is so apt to stifle the calls of nature as religious bigotry, it is enacted, that if any Popish parent shall refuse to allow his Protestant child a fitting maintenance, with a view to compel him to change his religion, the lord chancellor shall by order of court constrain him to do what is just and reasonable. But this did not extend to persons of another religion, of no less bitterness and bigotry than the Popish; and therefore, in the very next year, we find an instance of a Jew of immense riches, whose only daughter having embraced Christianity, he turned her out of doors; and on her application for relief, it was held she was entitled to none. But this gave occasion to another statute, which ordains, that if Jewish parents refuse to allow their Protestant children a fitting maintenance, suitable to the fortune of the parent, the lord chancellor, on complaint, may make such order therein as he shall see proper.\n\nOur law has made no provision to prevent the disinheriting of children by will; leaving every man's property in his own disposal, upon a principle of liberty in this as well as every other action; though perhaps it had not been amiss if the parent had been bound to leave them at least a necessary subsistence. Indeed, among persons of any rank or fortune, a competence is generally provided for younger children, and the bulk of the estate settled upon the eldest by the marriage articles. Heirs also, and children, are favourites of our courts of justice, and cannot be disinherited by any dubious or ambiguous words; there being required the utmost certainty of the testator's intentions to take away the right of an heir.\n\n2. From the duty of maintenance we may easily pass to that of protection; which is also a natural duty, but rather permitted than enjoined by any municipal laws; nature, in this respect, working so strongly as to need rather a check than a spur. A parent may, by our laws, maintain and uphold his children in their law-suits, without being guilty of the legal crime of maintaining quarells. A parent may also justify an assault and battery in defence of the persons of his children; nay, where a man's son was beaten by another boy, and the father went near a mile to find him, and there revenged his son's quarrel by beating the other boy, of which beating he afterwards unfortunately died; it was not held to be murder, but manslaughter merely. Such indulgence does the law show to the frailty of human nature, and the workings of parental affection.\n\n3. The last duty of parents to their children is that of giving them an education suitable to their station in life: a duty pointed out by reason and of far the greatest importance of any. For, as Puffendorff very well observes, it is not easy to imagine or allow, that a parent has conferred any considerable benefit upon his child by bringing him into the world, if he afterwards entirely neglects his culture and education, and suffers him to grow up like a mere beast, to lead a life useless to others, and shameful to himself. Yet the municipal laws of most countries seem to be defective in this point by not confining the parent to bestow a proper education upon his children. Perhaps they thought it punishment enough to leave the parent who neglects the instruction of his family, to labour under those griefs and inconveniences which his family, so un instructed, will be sure to bring upon him. Our laws, though their defects in this particular cannot be denied, have in one instance made a wise provision for breeding up the rising generation; since the poor and laborious part of the community, when past the age of nurture, are taken out of the hands of their parents, by the statutes for apprenticing poor children; and are placed out by the public in such a manner as may render their abilities, in their several stations, of the greatest advantage to the commonwealth. The rich indeed are left at their own option, whether they will breed up their children to be ornaments or disgraces to their family. Yet in one case, that of religion, they are under peculiar restrictions; for it is provided that if any person finds any child under his government beyond the seas, either to prevent its good education in England, or in order to enter into, or reside in, any Popish college, or to be instructed, persuaded, or strengthened in the Popish religion; in such case, besides the disabilities incurred by the child so sent, the parent or person sending shall forfeit £100, which shall go to the sole use and benefit of him that shall discover the offence. And if any parent, or other, shall send or convey any person beyond sea, to enter into, or be resident in, or trained up in, any priory, abbey, nunnery, Popish university, college or school, or house of Jesuits or priests, or in any private Popish family, in order to be instructed, persuaded or confirmed, in the\nPopish religion; or shall contribute any thing towards their maintenance when abroad by any pretext whatever, the person both sending and sent shall be disabled to sue in law or equity, or to be executor or administrator to any person, or to enjoy any legacy or deed of gift, or to bear any office in the realm, and shall forfeit all his goods and chattels, and likewise all his real estate for life. See Nonconformists.\n\nII. The power of parents over their children is derived from the former consideration, their duty; this authority being given them, partly to enable the parent more effectually to perform his duty, and partly as a recompense for his care and trouble in the faithful discharge of it. And upon this score the municipal laws of some nations have given a much larger authority to the parents than others. The ancient Roman laws gave the father a power of life and death over his children; upon this principle, that he who gave had also the power of taking away. But the rigour of these laws was softened by subsequent constitutions: so that we find a father banished by the emperor Hadrian for killing his son, though he had committed a very heinous crime; upon this maxim, that patris potestas in pietate debet, non in atrocitate, conficere. But still they maintained to the last a very large and absolute authority: for a son could not acquire any property of his own during the life of his father; but all his acquisitions belonged to the father, or at least the profits of them for his life.\n\nThe power of a parent by the English law is much more moderate; but still sufficient to keep the child in order and obedience. He may lawfully correct his child, being under age, in a reasonable manner: for this is for the benefit of his education. The consent or concurrence of the parent to the marriage of his child under age, was also directed by our ancient law to be obtained; but now it is absolutely necessary; for without it the contract is void. And this also is another means which the law has put into the parent's hands, in order the better to discharge his duty; first, of protecting his children from the snares of artful and designing persons; and next of settling them properly in life, by preventing the ill consequences of too early and precipitate marriages. A father has no other power over his son's estate, than as his trustee or guardian: for though he may receive the profits during the child's minority, yet he must account for them when he comes of age. He may indeed have the benefit of his children's labour while they live with him and are maintained by him; but this is no more than he is entitled to from his apprentices or servants. The legal power of a father (for a mother, as such, is entitled to no power, but only to reverence and respect), the power of a father, we say, over the persons of his children ceases at the age of 21; for they are then enfranchised by arriving at years of discretion, or that point which the law has established (as some must necessarily be established) when the empire of the father, or other guardian, gives place to the empire of reason. Yet, till that age arrives, this empire of the father continues even after his death; for he may by his will appoint a guardian to his children. He may also delegate part of his parental authority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child; who is then in loco parentis, and has such a portion of the power of the parent committed to his charge, viz., that of restraint and correction, as may be necessary to answer the purposes for which he is employed.\n\nIn the Gentleman's Magazine for 1759, we have the following case of conscience. \"A person has his own parents and his own children living, both parties equally indigent, both equally incapable of afflicting themselves, and both equally earnest in calling upon him for relief. Things are so circumstanced that he can possibly afflit but one party, and not both. Query, Which party has the greatest claim to his afflition, and to which is he obliged, by all ties human and divine, to give the preference?\" One solves this difficulty, by informing us of a pretty print done at Rome, representing a young woman fucking her aged father, on which the following lines are quoted:\n\nMy child and father vital nurture crave,\nParental, filial, fondness both would save;\nBut if a nurfling only one can live,\nI choose to save the life I cannot give.\n\nHere we find the preference given to the parent; and another correspondent gives the same decision in these words, \"The obligations arising from nature, and natural affection, seem to be in this case reciprocal and equipollent; the child is as strongly attracted to the parent, as the parent to the child. But will not filial gratitude operate and decide in favour of the parents? Does not the person, either mediately or immediately owe his present power and abilities to relieve, to his parents? and are not they on that account best entitled to relief? Does not the fifth commandment declare more strongly in favor of the parents, than any other divine precept does in favor of the children? If a person had an opportunity given him of delivering either his parent or his child (but not both) from certain death, I dare say the voice of nature and of mankind would applaud him that saved his parent, and condemn him that should prefer his child. There is more of selfishness in preferring the child; and to save the parent seems to me to be much the more generous, noble, and exalted conduct. It is indeed, upon the whole, a melancholy alternative; but if both parties continue impertinente, and neither will relinquish their claims in favour of the other, I say relieve the parent.\" There are two correspondents, however, who think differently, and their reasons are as follow: \"A person's children have the greatest claim to his afflition, and he is obliged by all ties to prefer them, in that respect, to his parents. It is true, when a man's parents are in want, they have a claim to his afflition; but that claim is not equal to that which his children have. His parents he has of necessity: his children, of choice. It is his duty, before he beget children, to consider how he is to provide for them: and by being wilfully the cause of their existence, he comes under such an obligation to provide for their comfortable subsistence, as must be stronger than any obligation of that kind he can be under to persons with whom his connexion is involuntary. But nature and reason point it out as the duty of all parents to provide for their children; but not vice versa. If a man's parents happen to be indigent, and he himself able, he is bound to maintain them out of respect and gratitude: but his obligation to provide for his children\nParent, is a debt of strict justice; and therefore ought to be preferred. Nevertheless the description of the case to which the query is subjoined, is so general, that it is easy to figure a case according to that description in which the person ought to prefer his parents. This obligation to provide for his children may have been dissolved by monstrous ingratitude, such as their plotting against his life; or he may have given them proper education, and ample provisions, which they have riotously squandered away; in either of which cases it is thought he is undoubtedly discharged from his obligation. But if they have lost their portion purely by misfortunes, without their fault, it is thought his obligation to assist them is not wholly extinguished; and in that case their claim to his affluence, or that of his parents, is preferable.\" \"I find (says the author of the last answer) that all your correspondents agree, that the life of the parent is to be preferred. It is very certain, that the relation between me and my child is exactly equal to that which is between me and my parent; and therefore relation cannot decide in favour of the one or the other: I must then be determined by a different consideration; and I know of none more weighty than the following. If I prefer the life of my child, I am instrumental in giving life to all his descendants, which may, perhaps, be very numerous; but if I prefer the life of my parent, I prefer a single life only, and that a short one. I therefore say, relieve the child. But it is thought that the voice of nature will applaud the person who prefers the parent: if so, nature must applaud a rule which the herself does not observe: it is natural for old men to die before young ones. Besides, the command, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, may be opposed to the fifth commandment.\" Still, however, it is doubtless difficult to determine in such cases when they occur, as there are no fixed rules whereby to decide. With respect to the power of parents and the duty of children, much may be said. There are, however, scarcely any instances where both are often abused than with respect to marriage. This, as it is the most important event in the civil life either of a man or woman, so it is often rendered peculiarly unfortunate, by precipitate folly and want of duty in children; and as often through the unreasonable severity of parents. As a child is bound not to give unreasonable offence to a parent in the choice of a partner; so neither ought the parent to impose any improper or arbitrary restraint upon the child.\n\nThe power of a parent in China is very great; for a father, while living, has the power of an absolute despotic tyrant, and after his death is worshipped as a god. Let a son become ever so rich, and a father ever so poor, there is no submission, no point of obedience, that the latter cannot command, or that the former can refuse. The father is absolute master, not only of his son's estate, but also of his concubines and children, who, whenever they displease him, he may sell to strangers. If a father accuses his son before a mandarin, there needs no proof of his guilt; for they cannot believe that any father can be so unnatural as to bring a false accusation against his own son. But should a son be so insolent as to mock his father, or arrive at such a pitch of wickedness as to strike him, all the province where this shameful act of violence is committed is alarmed; it even becomes the concern of the whole empire; the emperor himself judges the criminal. All the mandarins near the place are turned out of their posts, especially those of the town where he lived, for having been so negligent in their instructions; and all the neighbours are reprimanded for neglecting, by former punishments, to put a stop to the wickedness of the criminal before it arrived at such flagitiousness. As to the unhappy wretch himself, they cut him into a thousand pieces, burn his bones, level his house to the ground, and even those houses that stand near it, and set up monuments and memorials of the horrid deed.\n\nThe emperor of China, who is one of the most powerful and despotic monarchs upon earth, pays the greatest attention to his mother. An instance of this Pere Amyot relates as having happened at Pekin, A.D. 1752, when the emperor's mother entered her 60th year, which, among the Chinese, is accounted a very remarkable period. Grolier likewise particularly describes the homage the emperor pays his mother every new-year's day in the palace, at which ceremony all the great officers of his court assist. See Children, Filial Piety, Parental Affection, &c.\n\nParent, Anthony, a mathematician, was born at Paris in 1666. He showed an early propensity to mathematics. He accustomed himself to write remarks upon the margins of the books which he read; and he had filled a variety of books with a kind of commentary at the early age of thirteen. At fourteen he was put under a master, who taught rhetoric at Chartres. It was here that he happened to see a dodecahedron, upon every face of which was delineated a sun dial, except the lowest, wherein it stood. Struck as it were instantaneously with the curiosity of these dials, he attempted drawing one himself; but having a book which only showed the practical part without the theory, it was not till after his master came to explain the doctrine of the sphere to him that he began to understand how the projection of the circles of the sphere formed sun dials. He then undertook to write a Treatise upon Gnomonics. The piece was indeed rude and unpolished; but it was entirely his own, and not borrowed. About the same time he wrote a book of Geometry, in the same taste, at Beauvais. His friends then sent for him to Paris to study the law; and, in obedience to them, he studied a course in that faculty; which was no sooner finished, than, urged by his passion for mathematics, he flung himself up in the college of Dormans, that no avocation might take him from his beloved study; and, with an allowance of less than 200 livres a-year, he lived content in this retreat, from which he never flirtered but to the Royal College, in order to hear the lectures of M. de la Hire or M. de Sauveur. When he found himself capable of teaching others, he took pupils: and fortification being a branch of mathematics which the war had brought into particular notice, he turned his attention to it; but after some time began to entertain scruples about teaching what he had never seen, and knew only by the force of imagination. He imparted this scruple to M. Sauveur, who recommended him to the marquis d'Aligre, who luckily at that time wanted to have a mathematician with him. Parent made two campaigns with the marquis, by which\nhe instructed himself sufficiently in viewing fortified places; of which he drew a number of plans, though he had never learned the art of drawing. From this period he spent his time in a continual application to the study of natural philosophy, and mathematics in all its branches, both speculative and practical; to which he joined anatomy, botany, and chemistry. His genius managed every thing, and yet he was incessant and indefatigable in his application. M. de Billeter, who was admitted into the Academy of Sciences at Paris in 1699, with the title of their mechanician, nominated for his disciple Parent, who excelled chiefly in this branch. It was soon discovered in this society, that he engaged in all the various subjects which were brought before them; and indeed that he had a hand in every thing. But this extent of knowledge, joined to a natural impetuosity of temper, raised in him a spirit of contradiction, which he indulged on all occasions; sometimes to a degree of precipitancy highly culpable, and often with but little regard to decency. Indeed the same behaviour was shown to him, and the papers which he brought to the academy were often treated with much severity. He was charged with obscurity in his productions; and he was indeed so notorious for this fault, that he perceived it himself, and could not avoid correcting it. The king had, by a regulation in 1716, suppressed the class of scholars of the academy, which seemed to put too great an inequality between the members. Parent was made a joint or affiliated member for geometry: but he enjoyed this promotion but a short time; for he was taken off by the smallpox the same year, at the age of 50. He was author of a great many pieces, chiefly on mechanics and geometry.\n\nPARENTAL, something belonging to the relation of parent. See PARENT.\n\nPARENTAL Affection, the endearing attachment of parents to their children, including in it love; a desire of doing good to those who by an act of our own depend upon us for all that they enjoy. Nature even excites this affection in brutes: but in them it continues only so long as it is necessary for the preservation of their offspring; for when these are able to provide for themselves, it ceases, and the relation is forgotten. In man, however, though it lessens, or at least becomes less anxious as the dependence of the child becomes less, it never entirely ceases, except in some few instances of extreme depravity. Authors, however, have imagined, and Lord Kames among the rest, that after the child is provided for, and no more depends on the parent, all affection would cease, were it not artificially preserved and confirmed by habit. Whether his lordship, in this opinion, be right or wrong, we shall not pretend to say. One thing, however, is certain, that it is natural or not, it is one of the greatest comforts of life, even when all dependence has ceased. It matters not that there are many instances where this comfort is not felt. Human depravity has often obliterated the finest feelings of the mind; and it is not to be wondered at if in some instances it do so in the case before us. A good heart certainly can enjoy no greater satisfaction than that arising from grateful returns of kindness and affection to an aged parent. As the vexations which parents receive from their children hasten the approach of age, and double the force of years; so the comforts which they reap from them are balm to all other sorrows, and disappoint the injuries of time. Parents repeat their lives in their offspring; and their concern for them is so near, that they feel all their sufferings, and taste all their enjoyments, as much as if they regarded their own persons. However strong we may suppose the fondness of a father for his children, yet they will find more lively marks of tenderness in the bosom of a mother. There are no ties in nature to compare with those which unite an affectionate mother to her children, when they repay her tenderness with obedience and love.\n\nWe have a remarkable instance of parental affection in Zaleucus, prince of the Locrians; who made a decree, that whoever was convicted of adultery should be punished with the loss of both his eyes. Soon after this establishment, the legislator's own son was apprehended in the very fact, and brought to a public trial. How could the father acquit himself in so tender and delicate a conjuncture? Should he execute the law in all its rigour, this would be worse than death to the unhappy youth: should he pardon so notorious a delinquent, this would defeat the design of his salutary institution. To avoid both these inconveniences, he ordered one of his own eyes to be pulled out and one of his son's.\n\nDiodorus Siculus also, lib. 34, relates a surprising instance of the same warm affection. Cambalus, a young gentleman of character and fortune in the city of Miletus, being one day out courting, was way-laid, and very near being robbed and murdered by the banditti who infested that part of the country. Gorgus, the young gentleman's father, happened to come by at the very instant, to whom Cambalus related the danger he was in. The son was on foot, the father on horseback; but no sooner had he heard the melancholy tale, than he leapt from his horse, desired his son to mount, and make the best of his way into the city: but Cambalus, preferring his father's safety to his own, would by no means consent to it; on the contrary, conjured his father to leave him, and take care of himself. The father, struck with the generosity and affection of his son, added tears to entreaties, but all to no purpose. The contest between them is better conceived than described—while bathed in tears, and beseeching each other to preserve his own life, the banditti approached and stabbed them both.\n\nAmongst the ancient Greeks, the sentiments of parental affection were exceedingly strong and ardent. The mutual tenderness of the husband and the wife was communicated to their offspring; while the father viewed in his child the charms of its mother, and the mother perceived in it the manly graces of its father. As paternal kindness is the most simple and natural expansion of self-love, so there are innumerable instances of it in all countries savage and civilized.\n\nPARENTALIA, in antiquity, funeral obsequies, or the last duties paid by children to their deceased parents.\n\nPARENTHESIS, in grammar, certain intercalary words inserted in a discourse, which interrupt the sense or thread, but seem necessary for the better understanding of the subject.\n\nPARENZO, a small but strong town of Italy, and in Iliria, with a bishop's see and a good harbour; feat-\nPARESIS, in Medicine, a palsy of the bladder, wherein the urine is either suppressed or discharged involuntarily.\n\nTARGETING, in building, is used for the plastering of walls, and sometimes for plaster itself.\n\nTargeting is of various kinds: 1. White lime and hair mortar laid on bare walls. 2. On bare laths, as in partitioning and plain ceiling. 3. Rendering the inside of walls, or doubling partition walls. 4. Roughcasting on heart laths. 5. Plastering on brick work, with finishing mortar, in imitation of stone work; and the like upon heart laths.\n\nPARHELION, or PARHELION, formed from νερα near, and ἡλίου sun, in Natural Philosophy, a mock sun or meteor, in form of a very bright light, appearing on the one side of the sun.\n\nAppearances of this kind have been made mention of both by the ancients and moderns. Aristotle observes, that in general they are seen only when the sun is near the horizon, though he takes notice of two that were seen in Bophorus from morning to evening; and Pliny has related the times when such phenomena were observed at Rome. Gaffendi says, that in 1635 and 1636 he often saw one mock sun. Two were observed by M. de la Hire in 1680; and the same number by Caffini in 1693, Mr Grey in 1700, and Dr Halley in 1702: but the most celebrated appearances of this kind were seen at Rome by Scheiner, by Muffchenbrock at Utrecht, and by Hevelius at Sedan. By the two former, four mock suns were observed, and by the latter seven.\n\nParhelia are apparently of the same size with the sun, though not always of the same brightness, nor even of the same shape; and when a number appear at once, there is some difference in both these respects among them. Externally they are tinged with colours like the rainbow; and many have a long fiery tail opposite to the sun, but paler towards the extremity. Parhelia are generally accompanied with coronas, some of which are tinged with rainbow colours, but others are white. They differ in number and size; but all agree in breadth, which is that of the apparent diameter of the sun.\n\nA very large white circle, parallel to the horizon, generally passes through all the parhelia; and, if it were entire, it would go through the centre of the sun. Sometimes there are arcs of lesser circles concentric to this, touching those coloured circles which surround the sun. They are also tinged with colours, and contain other parhelia. There are also said to have been other circles obliquely situated with respect to all those we have mentioned; but of this we have met with no authentic account. The order of the colours in these circles is the same as in the rainbow; but on the inside, with respect to the sun, they are red, as is also observed in many other coronas.\n\nParhelia have been visible for 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours together; and in North America they are said to continue some days, and to be visible from sunrise to sunset.\n\nWhen the parhelia disappear, it sometimes rains, or there falls snow in the form of oblong spicules, as Malaldi, Weidler, Krafft, and others, have observed; and because the air in North America abounds with such parhelia frozen spicules, which are even visible to the eye, according to Ellis and Middleton, such particles have been thought to be the cause of all coronas and parhelia.\n\nMr Ellis says, that, at Churchill in Hudson's Bay, the rising of the sun is always preceded by two long streams of red light, one on each side of him, and about 20° distant from him. These rise as the sun rises; and as they grow longer begin to bend towards each other, till they meet directly over the sun, just as he rises, forming there a kind of parhelion or mock sun. These two streams of light, he says, seem to have their source in two other parhelia, which rise with the true sun; and in the winter season, when the sun never rises above the haze or fog, which he says is constantly found near the horizon, all these accompany him the whole day, and set with him in the same manner as they rise. Once or twice he saw a fourth parhelion directly under the true sun; but this, he says, is not common. These facts being constant, are very valuable, and may throw great light on the theory of these remarkable phenomena.\n\nSometimes parhelia appear in a different manner; as when three suns have been seen in the same vertical circle, well defined, and touching one another. The true sun was in the middle, and the lowest touched the horizon; and they set one after the other. This appearance was seen by M. Malezieuw in 1722. Other appearances similar to this are recited by M. Muffchenbrock.\n\nSometimes the sun has risen or set with a luminous tail projecting from him, of the same breadth with his diameter, and perpendicular to the horizon. Such an appearance was seen by Caffini in 1672 and 1692, by De la Hire in 1702, and by Mr Ellis in Hudson's Bay.\n\nAs M. Feuillée was walking on the banks of the river La Plata, he saw the sun rising over the river with a luminous tail projecting downwards, which continued till he was six degrees high.\n\nParafelene, or mock moons, have also been seen, accompanied with tails and coloured circles, like those which accompany the parhelia. An account of several, and a particular description of a fine appearance of this kind, may be seen in Muffchenbrock.\n\nThe Roman phenomenon, observed by Scheiner, is famous on account of its having been the first appearance of the kind that engaged the attention of philosophers. It is represented in fig. 1.; in which A is the place of the observer, B his zenith, C the true sun, AB a plane passing through the observer's eye, the true sun, and the zenith. About the sun C, there appeared two concentric rings, not complete, but diversified with colours. The lesser of them, DEF, was fuller, and more perfect; and though it was open from D to F, yet those ends were perpetually endeavouring to unite; and sometimes they did so. The outer of these rings was much fainter, so scarcely to be discernible. It had, however, a variety of colours; but was very inconstant. The third circle, KLMN, was very large, and all over white, passing through the middle of the sun, and everywhere parallel to the horizon. At first this circle was entire; but towards the end of the appearance it was weak and ragged, so as hardly to be perceived from M towards N.\nIn the intersection of this circle, and the outward iris GKL, there broke out two parhelia or mock suns N and K, not quite perfect; K being rather weak, but N more brighter and stronger. The brightness of the middle of them was something like that of the sun; but towards the edges they were tinged with colours like those of the rainbow; and they were uneven and ragged. The parhelion N was a little wavering, and sent out a spiked tail, NP, of a colour somewhat fiery, the length of which was continually changing.\n\nThe parhelia at L and M in the horizontal ring were not so bright as the former; but were rounder, and white, like the circle in which they were placed. The parhelion N disappeared before K; and while M grew fainter, K grew brighter, and vanished the last of all.\n\nIt is to be observed farther, that the order of the colours in the circles DEF, GKN, was the same as in the common halos, namely, red next the sun; and the diameter of the inner circle was also about 45 degrees; which is the usual size of a halo.\n\nThe reverend Dr Hamilton sent the following account of parhelia, seen at Cookstown, to the Royal Irish Academy.\n\n\"Wednesday, September 24th, 1733, as I was preparing to observe the sun passing the meridian, before the first limb touched the centre wire, it was obscured by a dark well-defined cloud, about 10° in diameter. Upon going to the door of the transit room, to see if it was likely soon to pass off the disk of the sun, I observed the following phenomena: From the western edge of the cloud issued a luminous arc parallel to the horizon, perfectly well defined, extending exactly to the northern meridian; it was about 30° broad, white, and ended in a blunted termination. On it were two parhelia; the nearest to the sun displaying the prismatic colours; the remote one white, and both ill-defined. In a short time the cloud had passed off, and showed the luminous almucaantar, reaching perfect to the true sun. While things were thus situated, I measured with an accurate sextant the distances of the parhelia; I found the coloured one 26°, the remoter one 92°, from the true sun. Just as I had done this, a new and prismatic circle surrounded the sun immediately with the prismatic parhelion. And now another coloured parhelion appeared on the eastern board.—The sextant with its face up and down, exactly measured this and the former at the original distance of 26°; the luminous almucaantar still remaining perfect. In about 10 or 12 minutes whithersoever hazy clouds came on, and obscured all these uncommon appearances.—I did not observe that the atmospheric phenomena before or after were at all uncommon. The wind a light breeze at SSW. Bar. 29.6 rising. Thermometer 55°.\"\n\nIn fig. 2, SM represents the south meridian; NM the north meridian; PP the prismatic circle, with two prismatic fans or parhelia, at 26° distance on each side the true sun; W the white parhelion, at 92° distance from the true sun; LA the luminous almucaantar; and HO the horizon.\n\nVarious hypotheses have been framed by philosophers to account for this phenomenon, particularly by M. Marriotte, Delcarles, and Huygens. None of them, however, are satisfactory; but those readers who wish to become acquainted with them may consult Huygens's Dissertation on this subject, in Smith's Optics, Book I. ch. ii.

It produces colouring drugs, gums, medicinal roots, Brazil wood, sugar, tobacco, and some valuable timber; the inland parts being woody and mountainous, but interspersed with fine valleys that yield corn and pasture. Comana is the capital town.\n\nPARIAN CHRONICLE. See ARUNDELLIAN MARMORS, and Parian Chronicle.\n\nUnder the article Parian Chronicle, we have been as full as the subject seemed to require, or as the nature of our work would admit. It is unnecessary, therefore, to refine it in this place. Such of our readers, however, as wish for further information on this subject (which is equally interesting to the scholar and to the antiquarian) we must refer to Robertson's attack upon their authenticity, and to Gough's learned and judicious vindication of the authenticity, published in Archaeologia for 1789. The extent of his learning, and the fidelity of his arguments, appear upon the whole to outweigh the objections of his sensible and plausible opponent. Hewlett's book upon the same side of the question may command some degree of attention. It is ingenious. See SANDWICH MARBLE.\n\nPARIAN Marble, among the ancients, the white marble used by them, and to this day, for carving statues, &c., and called by us at this time statuary marble.\n\nToo many of the later writers have confounded all the white marbles under the name of the Parian; and among the workmen, this and all the other white marbles have the common name of alabaster; so that it is in general forgotten among them, that there is such a thing as alabaster different from marble; which, however, is truly the case. Almost all the world also have confounded the Carrara marble with this, though they are really very different; the Carrara kind being of a finer texture and clearer white than the Parian; but less bright and splendid, harder to cut, and not capable of glittering a polish.\n\nThe true Parian marble has usually somewhat of a faint bluish tinge among the white, and often has blue veins in different parts of it. It is supposed by some to have had its name from the island Paros, one of the Cyclades in the Aegean sea, where it was first found; but others will have it to have been so called from Agoracrates Parius, a famous statuary, who emblazoned it by cutting a statue of Venus in it.\n\nPARIAS, or PEREAS, a tribe of Hindoos, peculiarly distinguished from all others, that they live by themselves in the outskirts of towns; and, in the country, build their houses apart from the villages, or rather have villages of their own, furnished with wells; for Mod. Ustr. they dare not so much as fetch water from those which Hyd. v. 5. other families make use of; and, lest these latter should inadvertently go to one of theirs, they are obliged to scatter the bones of dead cattle about their wells, that they may be known. They dare not in cities pass through\nthrough the streets where the Bramins live; nor set foot in the villages where they dwell.—They are likewise forbidden to enter a temple, either of their god Wilt-\nnow or Eswara; because they are held impure. They get their bread by fowling, digging, and building the walls of mud houles; most of those inhabited by the common people being raised by thee Parias; who also do such kinds of dirty work as other people do not care to meddle with. Nor is their diet much more cleanly; for they do not scruple to eat cows, horses, fowl, or other carrion, which die of themselves, and are even putrid. One would scarce imagine, that contentions for prece-\ndency should ever enter into the thoughts of a people who have renounced all cleanliness, and, like swine, wal-\nlow in filth; and yet pride has divided the Parias into two classes: the first are simply called Parias, the other Seriperes. The employment of these latter is to go about felling leather, which they dress; also to make bridles, and such kind of things; some of them likewise serve for soldiers. The Parias, who reckon themselves the better family, will not eat in the house of the Seriperes; but the Seriperes will readily eat with the Parias. For this reason they are obliged to pay them respect, by raising their hands aloft, and standing up-\nright before them. These Seriperes, when they marry, cannot set up a pandel, a kind of garland, before their doors, made with more than three flake or trees; should they exceed that number, the whole city would be in motion. The Seriperes are likewise subject to some sort of slavery; for when any person of credit or authority dies in the families of the Komitis, Sittis, Palis, farriers, or goldsmiths, and the friends have a mind to be at the expense of some clothes to give the Seriperes, these latter must suffer their beards to be shaven; and when the corpse is carried out of town to be burned or interred, they must do that office; for which each receives a fa-\nnum, or one piece and a half of silver, worth three sous and a half. There are the same sort of people who are called at Surat Halalchor; that is, in the Persian lan-\nguage, \"eat-alls, or eaters at large.\" Nothing can of-\nfend an Hindoo more than to be called a Halalchor: yet these poor people are not offended, cringe and bow to all they pass, and go through their drudgery without noise or concern.\n\nThe Parias are very vicious, stupid, and ignorant, occasioned by their wretched way of life: The Bramins and nobility shun them as if they had the plague, and look on the meeting a Parias as the greatest misfortune. To come near one of them is a sin, to touch them a fa-\ncililege. If a Parias were dying, it is infamy to visit him, or to give him the least affiance, in the utmost danger or distress. A Bramin who unavoidably should touch a Parias, immediately washes himself from the im-\npurity. Even their shadow and breath being reckoned contagious, they are obliged to live on the east side of their towns, that the westerly winds which prevail in this country may keep back their breath. And it is lawful for a Bramin to kill one of these unhappy crea-\ntures, if he does not avoid it by getting out of his way: In short, they think them reprobated by God, and be-\nlieve the souls of the damned enter into the Parias, to be punished for their crimes.—Yet the million have found among these dregs of the people very active zealous ca-\ntechists, who by their labours have very much contribu-\nted to the conversion of their countrymen, particularly one Rajanaiken a Parias soldier, who, of all the inferior Parian missionaries, has distinguished himself most by his labours and sufferings.\n\nPARIETALIA OSSA.

But of his life few particulars have been transmitted to us. Leland his original biographer, without determining whether he was born in France or Eng-\nland, informs us, that he was a monk of St Albans, and that he was sent by Pope Innocent to reform the monks of the convent at Holm in Norway. Bishop Bale, the next point of time, adds to the above relation, that, on account of his extraordinary gifts of body and mind, he was much esteemed, particularly by King Henry III. who commanded him to write the history of his reign. Fuller makes him a native of Cambridgeshire, because there was an ancient family of his name in that county. He also mentions his being sent by the pope to visit the monks in the diocese of Norwich. Bishop Tanner, Bishop Nicholson, Doctor Du Pin, and the Nouveau Dictionnaire Historique, add not a single fact to those above related. Matthew Paris died in the monastery of St Albans in the year 1259. He was doubtless a man of extraordinary knowledge for the 13th century; of an excellent moral character, and, as an hi-\nstorian, of strict integrity. His style is unpolished; but that defect is sufficiently atoned for by the honest free-\ndom with which he relates the truth, regardless of the dignity or sanctity of the persons concerned. His works are, 1. Historia ab Adamo ad Conquestum Anglie, Lib. I. manuscript, col. C. C. Cantab. c. ix. Most of this book is transcribed, by Matthew of Westminster, into the first part of his Florilegium. 2. Historia major, seu rerum Anglicanarum historia à Gul. Conquestoris adventu ad annum 43 Henrici III. &c. several times printed. The first part of this history, viz. to the year 1235, is transferred almost verbatim from the Chronicle of Ro-\nger Wendover; and the Appendix, from the year 1260, in the work of William Rahinger, who was also a monk of St Albans. 3.

He was decreed, even before his birth, to become the ruin of his country; and when his mother, in the first months of her pregnancy, had dreamt that she should bring forth a torch which would set fire to her palace, the soothsayers foretold the calamities which were to be expected from the imprudence of her future.\nfuture son, and which would end in the ruin of Troy. Priam, to prevent so great and so alarming an evil, ordered his slave Archelaus to destroy the child as soon as he was born. The slave, either touched with humanity, or influenced by Hecuba, did not obey, but was satisfied to expose the child on Mount Ida, where the shepherds of the place found him, and educated him as their own. Some attribute the preservation of his life, before he was found by the shepherds, to the motherly tenderness of a she bear who suckled him. Young Paris, though educated among shepherds and peasants, gave very early proofs of courage and intrepidity; and from his care in protecting the flocks of Mount Ida from the rapacity of the wild beasts, he was named Alexander, \"helper or defender.\" He gained the esteem of all the shepherds, and his graceful countenance and manly deportment recommended him to the favours of Oenone, a nymph of Ida, whom he married, and with whom he lived with the most perfect tenderness. Their conjugal peace was, however, of no long duration. At the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, the goddesses of discord, who had not been invited to partake of the entertainment, thwarted her displeasure, by throwing into the assembly of the gods who were at the celebration of the nuptials, a golden apple, on which were written the words \"Datur pulchriori.\" All the goddesses claimed it as their own; the contention at first became general; but at last only three, Juno, Venus, and Minerva, wished to dispute their respective right to beauty. The gods, unwilling to become arbiters in an affair so tender and so delicate in its nature, appointed Paris to adjudge the prize of beauty to the fairest of the goddesses; and indeed the shepherd seemed sufficiently qualified to decide so great a contest, as his wisdom was so well established, and his prudence and sagacity so well known. The goddesses appeared before their judge without any covering or ornament, and each endeavoured by promises and entreaties to gain the attention of Paris, and to influence his judgement. Juno promised him a kingdom; Minerva military glory; and Venus the fairest woman in the world for his wife, as Ovid expresses it, *Hesiod* 17. v. 118.\n\n*Unaque cum regnum; belli daret altera laudem; Tyndaridis coniugis, teria dixit, eris.*\n\nAfter he had heard their several claims and promises, Paris adjudged the prize to Venus, and gave her the golden apple, to which perhaps she seemed entitled as the goddess of beauty. This decision of Paris drew upon the judge and his family the resentment of the two other goddesses. Soon after, Priam proposed a contest among his sons and other princes, and promised to reward the conqueror with one of the finest bulls of Mount Ida. His emissaries were sent to procure the animal, and it was found in the possession of Paris, who reluctantly yielded it. The shepherd was anxious to regain his favourite, and he went to Troy and entered the lists of the combatants. He was received with the greatest applause, and obtained the victory over his rivals, Neptor the son of Neleus, Cyenus son of Neptune, Polites, Helenus, and Deiphobus, sons of Priam. He likewise obtained a superiority over Hector himself; which prince, enraged to see himself conquered by an unknown stranger, pursued him closely; and Paris must have fallen a victim to his brother's rage, had he not fled to the altar of Jupiter. This sacred retreat preserved his life; and Caïandra the daughter of Priam, struck with the similarity of the features of Paris with those of her brothers, enquired his birth and age. From these circumstances the fates discovered that he was her brother, and as such she introduced him to her father and to her brothers. Priam acknowledged Paris as his son, forgetful of the alarming dreams which had caused him to meditate his death, and all jealousy ceased among the brothers. Paris did not long suffer himself to remain inactive; he equipped a fleet, as if willing to redeem Hefione his father's fitter, whom Hercules had carried away and obliged to marry Telamon the son of Æacus. This was the pretended motive of his voyage, but the causes were far different. Paris remembered that he was to be the husband of the fairest of women; and, if he had been led to form those expectations while he was an obscure shepherd of Ida, he had now every plausible reason to see them realized, since he was the acknowledged son of the king of Troy. Helen was the fairest woman of the age, and Venus had promised her to him. On these grounds, therefore, he went to Sparta, the residence of Helen, who had married Menelaus. He was received with great respect; but he abused the hospitality of Menelaus, and while the husband was absent in Crete, Paris persuaded Helen to elope with him, and to fly to Asia. Helen consented; and Priam received her into his palace without difficulty, as his fitter was then detained in a foreign country, and as he wished to show himself as hostile as possible to the Greeks. This affair was soon productive of serious consequences. When Menelaus had married Helen, all her suitors had bound themselves by a solemn oath to protect her person, and therefore the injured husband reminded them of their engagements, and called upon them to recover her. Upon this all Greece took up arms in the cause of Menelaus; Agamemnon was chosen general of all the combined forces, and a regular war was begun. Paris, meanwhile, who had refused Helen to the petitions and embassies of the Greeks, armed himself, with his brothers and subjects, to oppose the enemy; but the success of the war was neither hindered nor accelerated by his means. He fought with little courage, and at the very sight of Menelaus, whom he had so recently injured, all his resolution vanished, and he retired from the front of the army, where he walked before like a conqueror. In a combat with Menelaus, which he undertook by means of his brother Hector, Paris must have perished, had not Venus interfered, and stolen him from the resentment of his antagonist. He wounded, however, in another battle, Machaon, Euryphilus, and Diomedes; and, according to some opinions, he killed with one of his arrows the great Achilles.\n\nThe death of Paris is differently related: some say that he was mortally wounded by one of the arrows of Philoctetes, which had been once in the possession of Hercules; and that when he found himself languid on account of his wounds, he ordered himself to be carried to the feet of Oenone, whom he had basely abandoned, and who in the years of his obscurity had foretold him that he would solicit her assistance in his dying moments. He expired before he came into the presence of Oenone; and the nymph, still mindful of their former loves, threw herself upon his body, and stabbed herself to the heart, after she had plentifully bathed it with her tears. According to others, Paris did not immediately go to Troy.\nParis. Troy when he left the Peloponnesus, but he was driven on the coasts of Egypt, where Proteus, who was king of the country, detained him; and when he heard of the violence which had been offered to the king of Sparta, he kept Helen at his court, and permitted Paris to retire. Whatever was the mode of his death, it took place, we are told about 1188 B.C. See Troy, &c.\n\nParis, the capital of the kingdom of France; is situated on the river Seine, in the Île de France, being one of the largest and finest cities in Europe. It derived its modern name from the ancient Parisii; and is supposed by some to have had the Latin name of Lutetia, from Lutum, \"mud,\" the place where it now stands having been anciently very marshy and muddy. Ever since the reign of Hugh Capet, that is, for near 800 years, this city has been the usual residence of the kings of France; it is of a circular form, and, including the suburbs, about five French leagues, or 15 English miles, in circumference. The number of its inhabitants is computed at about 800,000; that of its streets, 912; and that of its houses upwards of 23,000, exclusive of the public structures of all sorts. Its greatest defect, according to some, is the want of good drinking water; but others tell us, that very fine water is brought by an aqueduct from the village of Arcueil, not far from Paris, but own that the water of the Seine, and the city, is not good. The streets are of a proper breadth, well built, paved, and lighted. There is a great number of tribunals, and offices here; most of which are kept in the Palais, situated on an island, to which it gives name. The number of churches, convents, hospitals, market places, fountains, gates, and bridges, in this city is very great; besides the university, several academies, public libraries, royal palaces and castles, and above 100 hotels, some of them very stately. But to be more particular, that part called la Cité, lies in the centre, and consists of three islands formed by the Seine, viz. l'Île de Palais, l'Île de Notre Dame, and l'Île Louviers. It is the principal of the three parts into which the city is divided, and contains the following remarkable structures:\n\n1. Several bridges; of which some are of wood and others of stone, and have most of them a row of houses on each side. The chief of these are the Pont-neuf and Pont-royal: the first consists of 12 arches, which, properly speaking, make two bridges, the one leading from the suburb of St. Germain to the city, and the other from thence to that part called la Ville: there is a carriage way in the middle 40 feet broad, and footwalks on each side, raised two feet high; and in the centre stands a brass statue of King Henry IV. on horseback. On this bridge is also the building called La Samaritaine, from a group of figures upon it representing our Saviour and the Samaritan woman, standing near Jacob's well. Here is a pump to raise the water, which through several pipes supplies the quarter of the Louvre, and some other parts of the town. The Pont-royal, which leads to the Tuileries, was built by order of Lewis XIV., in the room of a wooden bridge that was carried away by the current in 1684.\n\n2. The cathedral of Notre Dame, or our Lady, being dedicated to the Holy Virgin, which is a large stately Gothic structure, said to have been founded by King Childeric, and built in the form of a cross. Here, besides other great personages, are interred the cardinals de Retz and Noailles. From the two square towers belonging to it, is a noble prospect of the city and neighbouring country. Here is a vast quantity of gold and silver plate, rich tapestry, and fine paintings; and the number of the canons is no less than 50. Near it stands the palace of the archbishop, in which is the advocates library: the revenue of the archbishop amounts to about 180,000 livres; and his taxation to the court of Rome is 4283 guilders. 3. The priory and parish church of St. Bartholomew; the last of which is the most beautiful in all this part of the city, and stands near the Palais. 4. The Palais, which gives name to an island, and in which the parliament, with a great many other courts, are held. It was anciently the residence of the kings; but was given to the officers of justice by Philip the Fair, who also settled the parliament here in 1302. The parliament, consisting of several chambers, each of which has its department, is opened the day after Martinmas with a solemn mass, celebrated by a bishop, and continues sitting till the 8th of September, when a vacation chamber is appointed during the interval, for criminal causes, and others which require despatch. The jurisdiction of this court is of great extent. There is a beautiful chapel belonging to the Palais: in which is also the prison, or jail, for the jurisdiction of the parliament, called in French La Conciergerie. 5. The Hotel Dieu, the most ancient and largest hospital in Paris, in which 8000 sick and infirm poor are taken care of, and attended by the nuns of the order of St. Augustine. 6. The hospital of St. Catherine, where poor women and maidens are entertained three days, and attended by the above-mentioned nuns. 7. The Grande Chatelet, where some of the inferior courts of justice hold their sittings. 8. Fort l'Eveque, in which is the mint and a prison. It stands in or near the street La Ferroniere, in which Henry IV. was stabbed by Ravillac. 9. St. Germain l'Auxerrois, which is called the royal palace church; because the palaces of the Louvre and Tuileries stand in its parish. 10. The Louvre, an ancient royal palace, of which a part was rebuilt by Lewis XIV. Had it been completed on the same plan, it would have been a most magnificent structure. On one of its gates is the following inscription, Dum totum implent orbem: the meaning of which is, \"May it last till the owner of it hath extended his sway over the whole world:\" which implies what the French kings have constantly aimed at. Another inscription shows, at the same time, the vanity of the nation, and their abject flattery of their grand monarch. It may be rendered in English thus:\n\nLouvre is a palace for great Louis fit:\nGod him alone exceeds, as heaven does it.\n\nThis palace is joined to the Tuileries by a gallery, in which are 180 models of fortresses, some situated in France, and some in other countries, executed with the utmost accuracy. Here is a valuable collection of paintings, the king's printing house, the mint where the king's medals are struck, together with a prodigious quantity of rich tapestry hangings, and a collection of ancient arms, among which are those worn by Francis I. at the famous battle of Pavia. Here also the French academy, the academy of inscriptions and belles lettres, the royal academy of sciences, the academy of painting and sculpture, and the royal academy of architecture, have their meetings. The first\nParis of these was founded for the improvement of the French language; and as for the others, their names explain the design of their institution. II. Le Palais Royal, which was built by Cardinal Richelieu, in the year 1636, and belongs to the duke of Orleans. It is said to contain pictures to the value of four millions of livres, which were purchased by the regent of that title, and of which a part belonged to Christina queen of Sweden. 12. The palace of the Tuileries, so called from a tile or brick kiln which stood there formerly. This palace, as we observed above, communicates with the Louvre by a gallery. Behind it are exceeding pleasant gardens, adorned with fine walks, planted with evergreens and other trees, and with beautiful parterres, where are to be seen, all the year round, every flower according to its season. There are also three fine fountains in the garden, and a canal. Behind the Tuileries, on the bank of the river, are pleasant walks, composed of four rows of lofty elms, to which vast crowds of people resort in the fine weather, as well as to the gardens. In the palace is a spacious and magnificent theatre; and hard by it are the Elyssian fields, where a surprising number of coaches are to be seen in fair weather; not far off is the church of St Roche, where the celebrated poet Corneille is interred. 13. La place de Louis le Grand, a very beautiful square, in the centre of which is an equestrian statue of that king, which is justly accounted a masterpiece. 14. The Place or Square des Victoires, which is round, and contains a statue of Louis XIV. of gilt brass, erected to him by the duke de la Feuillade, with this inscription, Viro immortalis. 15. The Royal Library in the Rue Vivien, which contains 94,000 printed books, 30,000 manuscripts, and a prodigious collection of copperplates and medals. Near this, in the churchyard of St Joseph, lies the famous comic poet Moliere. 16. The parish church of St Eustace, which stands in the quarter of the same name, and contains the tomb of the great minister Colbert. 17. The gate of St Denis, which was erected as a triumphal arch in honour of Louis XIV. 18. The gate of St Martin, erected also in form of a triumphal arch, in honour of the same king. Not far from hence, in the churchyard of St Nicholas des Champs, Peter Gassendi, and other learned men, are buried. 19. La Grève, an open place, where all public rejoicings are celebrated, and malefactors executed. 20. The Hotel de Ville, which is a large building of Gothic architecture, though adorned with columns of the Corinthian order. 21. The arsenal in the quarter of St Paul, consisting of many spacious buildings, among which are a foundry, and a house for making saltpetre. Here is a miniature of two barrels, which it is said will pierce a thick board at the distance of six miles; and for discovering an object at that distance, has a telescope fixed to the barrel. 22. The Baffile, now demolished, was a kind of fortress like the Tower of London, and used as a prison for state criminals, and for such as were taken up by lettres de cachet, i.e. by warrants signed by the king, and sealed. 23. Le Temple, a commandery of the knights of Malta, which gives name to a quarter, wherein, being a privileged place, artificers that are not freemen may carry on their businesses without molestation. The temple is the residence of the grand prior of the French nation. 24. That formerly called La Maison professe des Jésuites, in the quarter of St Anthony, in the church of which the hearts of Louis XIII. and XIV. are preserved, each in a casket of gold, supported by two angels of maffy silver, and as big as the life, hovering with expanded wings. In the same quarter is a fine looking glass manufacture, where above 300 persons are employed in polishing plates cast at St Gobin; with a convent of Franciscans, the monks of which are called Pique pieces, for Prick fleas.\n\nIn that part of the city called the University, the principal places are,\n\n1. The university, which gives name to it, and which was first founded, as it is said, by Charles the Great: all the arts and sciences are taught here, particularly law, physic, and divinity. There are above 40 colleges; of which the chief are those of Sorbonne, of Navarre, of the faculty of physic, and of the four nations; but lectures are read only in eleven of them. The head of the university is the rector, who is chosen every three months, but sometimes is continued several years. All the professors have settled salaries; the whole annual income of the university amounting, it is said, to about 50,000 livres. 2. The Gobelins a house or palace, where a great number of ingenious artists, in various manufactures and handicrafts, are employed by the government. The most curious tapestry of all sorts is made here. 3. The General Hospital, a most noble foundation for the poor of the female sex, near 7000 objects being taken care of and provided for. The sick are carefully tended; and those that are in health are obliged to work; different wards being allotted for foundlings, for girls who sew or knit, prostitutes, idiots, and poor women: of the last, some are kept gratis, and others pay a small matter. In the castle of Bicêtre, belonging to this hospital, and consisting of many large buildings, are near 4000 persons of the other sex, among which are persons differed in their senses, and such as are afflicted with the venereal disease. To this hospital are also sent children who abuse their parents, and lead dissolute lives. The fund for the maintenance of it, and the hospital de la Pitie, where poor children are brought up, together with the Hotel Dieu, amounts to about two millions of livres per annum. 4. The King's Physic Garden, in which are an infinite variety of plants and trees, a certain sum being allotted by the king for keeping the garden in order, and improving it, and for lectures on botany, anatomy, chemistry, and the materia medica. A curious collection of natural curiosities is kept here. 5. The abbey of St Victor, in which is a public library, containing some very ancient and scarce books, several curious manuscripts, and a prodigious collection of maps and copperplates. 6. The College of Physicians, to which belong five professors. 7. The Little Chatelet, an old fortress, now used for a prison. 8. The Rue St Jacques, chiefly inhabited by bookellers. 9. The Royal College, and that of Louis the Great: to the former belong twelve professors. 10. The Abbey of St Genevieve, in which is the marble monument of King Clovis, the shrine of St Genevieve, a large library, with a cabinet of antiquities and natural curiosities. 11. The Royal Observatory, a most stately edifice, built on the highest part of the city. Several astronomers are maintained here by the king. 12. The Royal Academy of Surgery, instituted in 1721. 13. The Convent of Franciscans.\nParisians, in the quarter of St Andrew, the richest in France. In the same quarter are some remains of the palace of Julian the Apostate, in which Childebert, and some other kings of the Franks, afterwards resided.\n\n14. The Playhouse. 15. The Convent of Carthusians, in the quarter of Luxemburg, containing fine paintings.\n\n16. The palace of Luxemburg or Orleans, a magnificent structure, containing also some fine paintings by Rubens, and embellished with a noble garden. In the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, ambassadors extraordinary are entertained for three days, and those of remote countries all the time they stay at Paris.\n\n17. The Abbey of St Germain des Prés, which contains a very valuable library, the manuscripts alone making 8000 volumes; here also is a cabinet of antiquities.\n\n18. The Hotel Royal des Invalides, erected by Louis XIV., in which lame and superannuated officers and soldiers are maintained. The buildings take up no less than 17 acres. The number of common soldiers here amount to about 3000, and of officers to about 500. The chapel is very magnificent. Hard by is a military academy, in which 500 young gentlemen are instructed in the art of war.\n\nOur readers from the above account will be able to conceive what Paris was. For an account of the changes which have taken place in that city during the progress of the revolution, see France; and for a more particular detail of those events we must refer to the numerous works which have appeared since the peace of Amiens, in the form of tours and descriptions, some of which are in the hands of every reader.\n\nParis, Herb Paris, or Truelove, a genus of plants belonging to the orchidaceae class, and in the natural method ranking under the 11th order, Sarmentaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nHerb Paris of Canada, a genus of plants belonging to the hexandria class. See Trillium, Botany Index.\n\nPlaster of Paris, or Stucco, or Parget of Montmartre, the first and the last name being derived from the place where it is found in great abundance, is a substance composed of lime and sulphuric acid, which on account of its property of rapidly absorbing water, after being calcined, is much employed in making casts and models. See Gypsum, Mineralogy and Geology Index.\n\nParish, the precinct of a parochial church, or a circuit of ground inhabited by people who belong to one church, and are under the particular charge of its minister.\n\nThe word comes from the Latin parochia, the Greek παροχία habitation; compounded of παρά near, and ὁμός house.—Accordingly Du Cange observes, that the name παροχία was anciently given to the whole territory of a bishop, and derives it from neighbourhood; because the primitive Christians, not daring to assemble openly in cities, were forced to meet secretly in neighbouring houses.\n\nIn the ancient church there was one large edifice in each city for the people to meet in; and this they called parochia, \"Parish.\" But the signification of the word was afterwards enlarged, and by a parish was meant a diocese, or the extent of the jurisdiction of a bishop, consisting of several churches, unless we will suppose, as some do, that those bishops were only pastors of single churches. Du Pin observes, that country parishes had not their origin before the 4th century; but those of cities are more ancient. The city of Alexandria is said to have been the first that was divided into parishes.\n\nOf the first division of parishes there is no certain information; for in the early ages of Christianity in this island, parishes were unknown, or at least signified the same that a diocese now does. There was then no appropriation of ecclesiastical dues to any particular church; but every man was at liberty to contribute his tithes to any priest or church he pleased, but he was obliged to do it to some; or if he made no special appropriation thereof, they were paid to the bishop, whose duty it was to distribute them among the clergy, and for other pious purposes, according to his own discretion. Camden says England was divided into parishes by Archbishop Honorius about the year 630. Sir Henry Hobart maintains that parishes were first erected by the council of Lateran, held A.D. 1179. But Mr Selden proves, that the clergy lived in common without any division of parishes, long after the time mentioned by Camden; and it appears from the Saxon laws, that parishes were in being long before the council of Lateran in 1179. The distinction of parishes occurs in the laws of King Edgar, about the year 970. It seems pretty clear and certain, says Judge Blackstone (Com. vol. i. p. 112), that the boundaries of parishes were first ascertained by those of a manor or manors; because it very seldom happens that a manor extends itself over more than one parish, though there are often many manors in one parish. The lords, he adds, as Christianity spread, began to build churches upon their own demesnes or wastes, in order to accommodate their tenants in one or two adjoining lordships; and that they might have divine service regularly performed therein, obliged all their tenants to appropriate their tithes to the maintenance of the one officiating minister, instead of leaving them at liberty to distribute them among the clergy of the diocese in general; and this tract of land, the tithes of which were so appropriated, formed a distinct parish; and this accounts for the frequent intermixture of parishes one with another. For if a lord had a parcel of land detached from the main of his estate, but not sufficient to form a parish of itself, it was natural for him to endow his newly erected church with the tithes of such lands. Extra-parochial wastes and marsh lands, when improved and drained, are by 17 Geo. II. cap. 37. to be affixed to all parochial rates in the parish next adjoining. Camden reckons 9284 parishes in England; and Chamberlayne makes 9913. They are now generally reckoned about 10,000.\n\nParish Clerk. In every parish the parson, vicar, &c. hath a parish clerk under him, who is the lowest officer of the church. These were formerly clerks in orders, and their business at first was to officiate at the altar; for which they had a competent maintenance by offerings; but they are now laymen, and have certain fees with the parson on christenings, marriages, burials, &c. besides wages for their maintenance. The law looks upon them as officers for life; and they are chosen by the minister of the parish, unless there is a custom for the parishioners or churchwardens to choose them; in which case the canon cannot abrogate such custom; and when chosen it is to be signified, and\nthey are to be sworn into their office by the archdeacon, for which the court of king's bench will grant a mandamus.\n\nPARISII, in Ancient Geography, a people of Gallia Celtica, inhabiting the country about the Sequana and Matrona.

Here stood a Cupid equal in exquisite workmanship to the Cnidian Venus.\n\nPARK (French parque, i.e. locus inclytus), is a large quantity of ground enclosed and privileged for wild beasts of chase, by the king's grant or prescription. See Chase and Forest.\n\nManwood defines a chace to be \"a privileged place, for beasts of venery, and other wild beasts of the forest and chace, tam fyllofices, quam campifices?\" and differs from a chace or warren, in that it must be enclosed: for if it lies open, it is good cause of seizure into the king's hands, as a thing forfeited; as a free chace is, if it be enclosed: besides, the owner cannot have an action against such as hunt in his park, if it lies open. No man can erect a park without licence under the broad seal; for the common law does not encourage matter of pleasure, which brings no profit to the commonwealth. But there may be a park in reputation erected without any lawful warrant; and the owner may bring his action against persons killing his deer.\n\nTo a park three things are required. 1. A grant thereof. 2. Enclosures by pale, wall, or hedge. 3. Beasts of a park; such as the buck, doe, &c. And where all the deer are destroyed, it shall no more be accounted a park; for a part consists of vert, venison, and enclosure: and if it is determined in any of them, it is a total disparking.\n\nParks as well as chaces are subject to the common law, and are not to be governed by the forest laws.\n\nPark, as connected with gardening. See Gardening.\n\nA park and a garden are more nearly allied than a farm and a garden, and can therefore be accommodated to each other without any disparagement to either. A farm loses some of its characteristic properties by the connexion, and the advantage is on the part of the garden: but a park thus bordered retains all its own excellencies; they are only enriched, not counteracted, by the intermixture. The most perfect composition of a place that can be imagined, consists of a garden opening into a park, with a short walk through the latter to a farm, and ways along its glades to ridings in the country; but to the farm and the ridings the park is no more than a pasture; and its woods and its buildings are but circumstances in their views; its scenes can be communicated only to the garden.\n\nThe affinity of the two objects is so close, that it would be difficult to draw the exact line of separation between them. Gardens have lately encroached very much both in extent and in style on the character of a park; but still there are scenes in the one which are out of the reach of the other. The small sequestered spots which are agreeable in a garden would be trivial in a park; and the spacious lawns which are among the noblest features of the latter, would in the former fatigue by their want of variety; even such as, being of a moderate extent, may be admitted into either, will seem bare and naked, if not broken in the one; and lose much of their greatness, if broken in the other. The proportion of a part to the whole is a measure of its dimensions; it often determines the proper size for an object, as well as the space fit to be allotted to a scene; and regulates the style which ought to be assigned to either.\n\nBut whatever distinctions the extent may occasion between a park and a garden, a state of highly cultivated nature is consistent with each of their characters; and may in both be of the same kind, though in different degrees.\n\nThe excellencies both of a park and of a garden are happily blended at Hagley (A), where the scenes are equally elegant and noble. It is situated in the midst of a fertile and lovely country, between the Clent and the Witchberry hills; neither of which are within the pale, but both belong to the place. The latter rise in three beautiful swells. One of them is covered with wood; another is an open sheep walk, with an obelisk on the summit; on the third, the portico of the temple of Thetis, exactly on the model of that of Athens, and little less in the dimensions, stands boldly out upon the brow, backed by the dark ground of a fir plantation, and has a most majestic appearance above the slopes which fall before and beside it. The house is seen to the greatest advantage from these eminences, and every point of them commands some beautiful prospect. The busy town of Stourbridge is just below them; the ruins of Dudley castle rise in the off-slope; the country is full of industry and inhabitants; and a small portion of the moor, where the minerals, manufactured in the neighbourhood, are dug, breaking in upon the horizon, accounts for the richnesses, without detracting from the beauty, of the landscape. From the Clent hills the views are still greater: they extend on one side to the black mountains in Wales, a long ridge which appears, at 60 miles distance, in the interval between the unwieldy heap of the Malvern hills and the solitary peak of the Wrekin, each 30 miles off, and as many asunder. The smoke of Worcester, the churches in Birmingham, and the houses in Stourbridge, are distinctly visible. The country is a mixture of hill and dale, and strongly enclosed; except in one part, where a heath, varied by rising grounds, pieces of water, and several objects, forms an agreeable contrast to the cultivation.\n\n(A) Near Stourbridge, in Worcestershire, the seat of Lord Lyttleton.\nvation which surrounds it. From the other extremity of the Clent hills, the prospect is less extensive; but the ground is more rude and broken; it is often overspread with large and beautiful woods; and the view is dignified with numerous seats. The hills also being very irregular, large advanced promontories frequently interrupt the sight, and vary the scene: in other parts, deep valleys sloping down towards the country below, exhibit the objects there in different lights. In one of these hollows is built a neat cottage, under a deep descent, sheltered besides by plantations, and presenting ideas of retirement in the midst of so much open exposure: from the heights above it, is seen all that view which before was commanded from the Witchberry hills, but which is seen here over Hagley park; a noble foreground, beautiful in itself, and completing the landscape.\n\nThe house, though low in the park, is yet above the adjacent country, which it overlooks to a very distant horizon. It is surrounded by a lawn of fine uneven ground, and diversified with large clumps, little groups, and single trees. It is open in front, but covered on one side by the Witchberry hills; on the other side, and behind, by the eminences in the park, which are high and steep, and all overspread with a lofty hanging wood. The lawn pressing to the foot, or creeping up the slopes of these hills, and sometimes winding along glades into the depth of the wood, traces a beautiful outline to a fairy scene, already rich to luxuriance in multitudes of foliage and stateliness of growth.\n\nBut though the wood appears to be entire, it in reality opens frequently into lawns, which occupy much of the space within it. In the number, the variety, and the beauty of these lawns, in the shades of the separation between them, in their beauties also, and their varieties, the glory of Hagley consists. No two of the openings are alike in dimensions, in shape, or in character. One is of no more than five or six acres; another of not less than fifty; and others are of all the intermediate sizes. Some stretch out into lengthened glades; some widen every way: they are again distinguished by buildings, by prospects, and often by the style only of the plantations around them. The boundary of one is described by a few careless lines; that of another is composed of many parts, very different, and very irregular: and the ground is never flat; but falls sometimes in steep descents, sometimes in gentle declivities, waves along easy swells, or is thrown into broken inequalities, with endless variety.\n\nAn octagon seat, sacred to the memory of Thomson, and erected on his favourite spot, stands on the brow of a steep; a mead winds along the valley beneath, till it is lost on either hand behind some trees. Opposite to the seat, a noble wood crowns the top, and feathers down to the bottom of a large oval swelling hill. At its descent on one side, the distant country becomes the offskip. Over the fall, on the other side, the Clent hills appear. A dainty antique tower stands just below them, at the extremity of the wood; and in the midst of it is seen a Doric portico, called Pope's Building, with part of the lawn before it. The scene is very simple: the principal features are great; they prevail over all the rest, and are intimately connected with each other.\n\nThe next opening is small, circling about a rotunda on a knoll, to the foot of which the ground rises every way. The trees which surround it are large; but their foliage is not very thick; and their stems appearing beneath, their ramifications between the boughs are, in so confined a spot, very distinguished and agreeable circumstances. It is retired; has no prospect; no visible outlet but one, and that is short and narrow, to a bridge with a portico upon it, which terminates a piece of water.\n\nThe grove behind the rotunda separates this from a large, airy, forest glade, thinly skirted with wood, careless of dews, and much overgrown with fern. The wilderness is an acceptable relief in the midst of so much elegance and improvement as reign in the neighbouring lawns; and the place is in itself pleasant; in no part confined; and from a Gothic seat at the end is a perspective view of that wood and tower which were seen before in front, together with the Witchberry hills, and a wide range of country.\n\nThe tower, which in prospect is always connected with wood, stands however, on a piece of down, which stretches along the broad ridge of a hill, and spreads on each hand for some way down the sides. Thick groves catch the falls. The descent on the right is soon lost under the trees; but that on the left being steeper and shorter, it may be followed to the bottom. A wood hangs on the declivity, which is continued in the valley beneath. The tower overlooks the whole: it seems the remains of a castle, partly entire, partly in ruins, and partly overgrown with bushes. A finer situation cannot be imagined: It is placed in an exposed unfrequented spot; commands an extensive prospect; and is everywhere an interesting object.\n\nAt the end of the valley below it in an obscure corner, and shut out from all view, is a hermitage, composed of roots and of moss: high banks, and a thick covert darkened with horse-chestnuts, confine the sequestered spot: a little rill trickles through it, and two small pieces of water occupy the bottom. They are seen on one side through groups of trees; the other is open, but covered with fern. This valley is the extremity of the park; and the Clent hills rise in all their irregularity immediately above it.\n\nThe other descent from the castle is a long declivity, covered like the rest with noble woods, in which fine lawns are again embolomed, differing still from the former, and from each other. In one, the ground is very rough, the boundary is much broken, and marked only by the trunks of the trees which shoot up high before the branches begin. The next is more simple; and the ground falls from an even brow into one large hollow, which stops towards the glen, where it sinks into the covert. This has a communication through a short glade, and between two groves, with another called the Tinian lawn, from the resemblance which it is said to bear to those of that celebrated island: it is encompassed with the stateliest trees, all fresh and vigorous, and so full of leaf, that not a stem, nor a branch, appears, but large masses of foliage only describe an undulating outline; the effect, however, is not produced by the boughs feathering down to the bottom; they in appearance float out horizontally, a few feet above the ground, to a surprising distance, and from underneath an edging of shade, into which the retreat is immediate at every hour of the day. The verdure of\nthe turf is as luxuriant there as in the open space; the ground gently waves in both over easy fells and little dips, just varying, not breaking, the surface. No strong lines are drawn; no striking objects are admitted; but all is of an even temper, all mild, placid, and serene; in the gayest season of the day not more than cheerful, in the liveliest watch of night not gloomy. The scene is indeed peculiarly adapted to the tranquillity of the latter, when the moon seems to repose her light on the thick foliage of the grove, and steadily marks the shade of every bough. It is delightful then to saunter here, and see the grass, and the gossamer which entwines it, glinting with dew; to listen and hear nothing stir, except perhaps a withered leaf dropping gently through a tree; and, sheltered from the chill, to catch the freshness of the evening air: a solitary urn, chosen by Mr Pope for the spot, and now inscribed to his memory, when shown by a gleam of moonlight through the trees, fixes that thoughtfulness and composure to which the mind is infensibly led by the rest of this elegant scene.\n\nThe Doric portico, which also bears his name, though not within sight, is near: it is placed on the declivity of a hill; and Thomson's seat, with its groves and appendages, are agreeable circumstances in the prospect before it. In the valley beneath is fixed a bench, which commands a variety of short views; one is up the ascent to the portico, and others through openings in the wood to the bridge and the rotunda.\n\nThe next lawn is large: the ground is steep and irregular, but inclines to one direction, and falls from every side into the general declivity: the outline is diversified by many groups of trees on the slopes; and frequent glimpses of the country are seen in perspective through openings between them. In the brow is a seat, in the proudest situation of all Hagley; it commands a view down the bold sweep of the lawn, and over a valley filled with the noblest trees, up to the heights beyond. One of those heights is covered with a hanging wood; which opens only to show Thomson's seat, and the groves and the steep about it; the others are the Witchberry hills, which seem to press forward into the landscape; and the mazy heads of the trees in the vale, uniting into a continued surface, form a broad base to the temple of Theseus, hide the swell on which it is built, and crowd up to the very foundation. Farther back stands the obelisk; before it is the sheep walk; behind it the Witchberry wood. The temple is backed by the firs; and both these plantations are connected with that vast sylvan scene which overpreads the other hill and all the intermediate valley. Such extent of wood; such variety in the disposition of it; objects so illustrious in themselves, and ennobled by their situations, each contrasted to each, every one distinct, and all happily united; the parts so beautiful of a whole so great, seen from a charming lawn, and surrounded by a delightful country, compose all together a scene of real magnificence and grandeur.\n\nThe several lawns are separated by the finest trees; which sometimes grow in airy groves, chequered with gleams of light, and open to every breeze; but more frequently, whose great branches meeting or crossing each other, cast a deep impenetrable shade. Large boughs feathering down often intercept the sight; or a vacant space is filled with coppice wood, nut, hawthorn, and hornbeam, whose tufted heads mixing with the foliage, and whose little stems clustering about the trunks of the trees, thicken and darken the plantation. Here and there the division is of such coppice wood only, which then being less constrained and oppressed, springs up stronger, spreads further, and joins in a low vaulted covering: in other places the shade is high, overarched by the tallest ash, or spreads under the branches of the most venerable oaks. They rise in every shape, they are disposed in every form in which trees can grow. The ground beneath them is sometimes almost level; sometimes a gentle swell; but generally very irregular and broken. In several places, large hollows wind down the sides of the hills, worn in the stormy months by water courses, but worn many ages ago. Very old oaks in the midst of the channels prove their antiquity; some of them are perfectly dry most part of the year; and some are watered by little rills all the summer: they are deep and broad; the sides are commonly steep; often abrupt and hollow; and the trees on the bank sometimes extend their roots, all covered with moss, over the channels of the water. Low down in one of these glens, under a thick shade of horse chestnuts, is a plain bench, in the midst of several little currents and water falls, running among large loose stones, and the stumps of dead trees, with which the ground is broken. On the brink of another glen, which is distinguished by a numerous rookery, is a seat in a still wilder situation, near a deeper hollow, and in a darker gloom: the falls are nearly perpendicular; the roots of some of the trees are almost bare, from the earth having crumbled away; large boughs of others, sinking with their own weight, seem ready to break from the trunks they belong to; and the finest ash, still growing, lie all along the water course below, which, though the stream runs in winter only, yet constantly retains the black tinge of damp, and casts a chill all around.\n\nGravel walks are conducted across the glens, through the woods, the groves, or the thickets, and along the sides of the lawns, concealed generally from the sight, but always ready for the communication, and leading to the principal scenes. The frequency of these walks, the number and the style of the buildings, and the high preservation in which all the place is kept, give to the whole park the air of a garden. There is, however, one spot more peculiarly adapted to that purpose, and more artificially disposed than the rest; it is a narrow vale, divided into three parts: one of them is quite filled with water, which leaves no room for a path, but thick trees on either side come down quite to the brink; and between them the sight is conducted to the bridge with a portico upon it, which closes the view: another part of this vale is a deep gloom, overhung with large ash and oaks, and darkened below by a number of yews: these are scattered over very uneven ground, and open underneath; but they are encompassed by a thick covert, under which a stream falls, from a flinty channel, down a rock; other rills drop into the current, which afterwards pours over a second cascade into the third division of the vale, where it forms a piece of water, and is lost under the bridge. The view from this bridge is a perfect opera scene, through all the divisions of the vale up to the rotunda. Both these buildings, and the other decorations of the spot, are of the species generally con-\nPARKER, MATTHEW, the second Protestant archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Norwich in the year 1504, the 19th of Henry VII. His father, who was a man in trade, died when our author was about twelve years old; but his mother took special care of his education, and at the age of 17 sent him to Corpus Christi college in Cambridge, where, in 1523, he took his bachelor's degree. In 1527 he was ordained, created master of arts, and chosen fellow of the college. Having obtained a license to preach, he frequently held forth at St Paul's cross in London, and in other parts of the kingdom. In 1533 or 1534 he was made chaplain to Queen Anne Boleyn, who obtained for him the deanery of Stoke Clare in Suffolk, where he founded a grammar school. After the death of the queen, King Henry made him his own chaplain, and in 1541 prebendary of Ely. In 1544, he was, by the king's command, elected master of Corpus Christi college, and the following year vice chancellor of the university. In 1547 he lost the deanery of Stoke, by the dissolution of that college. In the same year he married the daughter of Robert Harlentone, a Norfolk gentleman.\n\nIn the year 1552 he was nominated, by Edward VI., to the deanery of Lincoln, which, with his other preferments, enabled him to live in great affluence; but the papist Mary was hardly seated on the throne before he was deprived of everything he held in the church, and obliged to live in obscurity, frequently changing his place of abode to avoid the fate of the other reformers.\n\nQueen Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1558; and in the following year Dr Parker, from indigence and obscurity, was at once raised to the see of Canterbury; an honour which he neither solicited nor desired. In this high station he acted with spirit and propriety. He visited his cathedral and diocese in 1560, 1567, and 1573. He repaired and beautified his palace at Lambeth at a vast expense. The sum which the repairs of the palace and great hall at Canterbury cost him was upwards of £400 sterling, which is at least equal to ten times the sum now-a-days. Both the palace and great hall were in decay, partly through the injuries of time, and partly through that of fire. The hall, built by Archbishop Huber in the 12th century, was famous in history for the great feasts that had been given there by archbishops and abbots in former times; in particular, at the nuptial feasts of King Edward I. in 1290; at the installation of the abbot of St. Austin's in 1309; at the enthronization of George Neville, archbishop of York, in 1464; and of Archbishop Warham in 1504, when Edward duke of Buckingham acted as lord high steward of his household; and lastly, for the entertainment given by that archbishop in 1519 to the emperor Charles V., Henry VIII., Queen Catherine, &c. In 1565 Archbishop Parker gave three entertainments in this hall at Whitunday (which lasted three days), on Trinity Sunday, and in assizes time. At the first of these the archbishop himself sat in the midst of the uppermost table; on his left hand the mayor, &c., and so on one side of the hall a continued row of men according to their rank filled the other tables; and on his right hand sat only some noble women and ladies of quality, the whole length of the hall, corresponding to the row of men on the other side; which order of placing the women was observed in honour of the queen. The first rank of guests being risen, and the tables cleared, they were furnished again, and filled the second time. At the last feast, which was grander than all the rest, the archbishop entertained the two judges who went that circuit (n), the attorney-general, the high-sheriff, with all who met at these assizes, as justices of the peace, advocates, and common lawyers, and all the rest of proctors and attorneys; who all (with a promiscuous company) in troops came in. The hall was set forth with much plate of silver and gold, adorned with much tapestry of Flanders; and dainties of all sorts were served in excellent order by none but the archbishop's servants, the table being often the same day furnished afresh with new guests; while the ladies were nobly entertained in inner parlours by Mrs Parker, the hall being now filled with gentlemen. Otherwise, at these feasts, it was the archbishop's custom, in honour of matrimony, to entertain both men and their wives. Of this noble hall and palace, now within 200 years, there is little or nothing left except a few ruins. On Whitunday, 1570, and the two following days, this archbishop feasted the citizens of Canterbury and their wives in the same manner as he had done before; and on Trinity Sunday (after consecrating Bishop Curteis of Chichester) he made another most archiepiscopal feast, inviting another archbishop (viz. Grindal of York, who came thither for confirmation) to be his guest; besides whom were present Horn bishop of Winchester, and Curteis bishop of Chichester. At the lower tables sat all the ministers and servants whatsoever, even the children, who belonged to that church; and at the remote tables, but in the same hall, in sight, sat the poor of both sexes of the hospitals of St John's and Harbledown. On July 11th, being assizes time, the judges, high-sheriff, gentlemen, and the common sort, were all feasted by the archbishop in a splendid manner as before. Soon after Bishop Sandys of Worcester, elect of London, came to Canterbury to be confirmed. The archbishop, on his return, lodged the first night at Sittingbourne, and the next night (after dining at Gravesend)\n\n(n) This proves that the judges of assizes then came to Canterbury, though it was then a county in itself, being so made in 1461.\nPARKER came to Lambeth in barges by Thames, with all his family. Sept. 7, 1573, being Q. Elizabeth's birthday, Archbishop Parker entertained her majesty, and as many noblemen, &c., as were present at Archbishop Warham's entertainment in the same hall 54 years before. The archbishop (to use his own words, in a letter to Archbishop Grindal of York) \"met her highness, as she was coming to Dover, upon Folkestone Down. I left her at Dover, and came home to Bekeshorn that night; and after that went to Canterbury to receive her majesty there. Which I did, with the bishops of Lincoln and Rochester, and my suffragan (of Dover), at the west door; where, after the grammarian had made his oration to her upon her horse-back, she alighted. We then kneeled down, and said the psalm Deus misereatur, in English, with certain other collects briefly; and that in our chimers and rochets. The quire, with the dean and prebendaries, stood on either side of the church, and brought her majesty up with a song; the going under a square canopy, borne by four of her temporal knights, to her traverse, placed by the communion board, where she heard evening song; and after departed to her lodging at St Austin's, whither I waited upon her. From thence I brought certain of the council, and divers of the court, to my house to supper, and gave them 14 or 15 dishes, furnished with two mefs, at my long table, whereat fat about 20; and in the same chamber a third mefs, at a square table, whereat fat 10 or 12; my lefs hall having three long tables furnished with my officers, and with the guard, and others of the court: and so her majesty came every Sunday to church to hear the sermon. And upon one Monday it pleased her highness to dine in my great hall, thoroughly furnished with the council, Frenchmen, ladies, gentlemen, and the mayor of the town, with his brethren, &c.; her highness sitting in the midst, having two French ambassadors (Gondius and Mothe-Fenelon) at the end of the table, and four ladies of honour at the other end. And so three mefs were served by her nobility at washing, her gentlemen and guard bringing her dishes, &c.\" On which the archbishop of York, in his answer, made this reflection: \"Your grace's large description of the entertainment at Canterbury did so lively set forth the matter, that in reading thereof I almost thought myself to be one of your guests there, and as it were beholding the whole order of all things done there. Sir, I think it shall be hard for any of our coat to do the like for one hundred years, and how long after God knoweth.\" In this progress Lord Treasurer Burleigh was lodged with Mr Pearlson, the eleventh prebendary, who, the archbishop says, \"had a fine house.\"\n\nHe founded several scholarships in Bennet or Corpus-Chrifti college in Cambridge, and gave large presents of plate to that and to other colleges in this university. He gave 100 volumes to the public library. He likewise founded a free school at Rochdale in Lancashire. He took care to have the fees filled with pious and learned men; and, considering the great want of Bibles in many places, he, with the affluence of other learned men, improved the English translation, had it printed on a large paper, and dispersed through the kingdom. This worthy prelate died in the year 1575, aged 72, and was buried in his own chapel at Lambeth. He was pious without affectation or austerity, cheerful and contented in the midst of adversity, moderate in the height of power, and beneficent beyond example. He wrote several books; and also published four of our best historians: Matthew of Westminster, Matthew Paris, Affer's Life of King Alfred, and Tho. Walfingham. The learned archbishop also translated the Psalter. This version was printed, but without a name; and has been attributed to an obscure poet of the name of Keeper. This was Wood's opinion; but it is more than probable that the learned author of the Athene Oxon. was wrong. See Gentleman's Magazine for 1781, p. 566, where Parker is proved to be the author of a version of the Psalms.\n\nPARKINSONIA, a genus of plants, belonging to the decandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 33rd order, Lomentaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nPARLEY, a conference with an enemy. Hence, to beat or found a parley, is to give a signal for holding such a conference by beat of drum, or sound of trumpet.\n\nPARLIAMENT, the grand assembly of the three estates of this kingdom, summoned together by the king's authority, to consider of matters relating to the public welfare, and particularly to enact and repeal laws.\n\nThe original or first institution of parliament is one origin not of those matters which lie so far hidden in the dark ages certainly of antiquity, that the tracing of it out is a thing equally known, difficult and uncertain. The word parliament itself (or colloquium, as some of our historians translate it) is, comparatively, of modern date; derived from the French, and signifying \"the place where they met and conferred together.\" It was first applied to general assemblies of the estates under Lewis VII. in France, about the middle of the 12th century. But it is certain, that long before the introduction of the Norman language into England, all matters of importance were debated and settled in the great councils of the realm. A practice which seems to have been universal among the northern nations, particularly the Germans; and carried by them into all the countries of Europe, which they overran at the dissolution of the Roman empire. Relics of which constitution, under various modifications and changes, are still to be met with in the diets of Poland, Germany, and Sweden, and lately in the assembly of the estates in France: for what is there now called the parliament, is only the supreme court of justice, consisting of the peers, certain dignified ecclesiastics, and judges; which neither is in practice, nor is supposed to be in theory, a general council of the realm.\n\nIn England, however, this general council hath been held immemorially, under the several names of michel-gemot, or \"great council;\" michel-gemote or \"great meeting;\" and more frequently wittena-gemore, or \"the meeting of wise men.\" It was also styled in Latin, commune concilium regni, magnum concilium regis, curia magna, convenus magnatum vel procerum, affisa generalis, and sometimes communias regni Anglie. We have instances of its meeting to order the affairs of the kingdom, to make new laws, and to amend the old, or, as Flota expresses it, novis injuriis emeritis nova conficiere remediis, to early as the reign of Ina king of the West Saxons, Offa king of the Mercians, and Ethelbert king of Kent, in the several realms of the heptarchy. And after their union, the Mirror informs us, that King Alfred ordained for a perpetual usage, that these councils...\nParliament should meet twice in the year, or oftener, if need be, to treat of the government of God's people; how they should keep themselves from sin, should live in quiet, and should receive right. Our succeeding Saxon and Danish monarchs held frequent councils of this sort, as appears from their respective codes of laws; the titles whereof usually speak them to be enacted, either by the king with the advice of his wisemen-geneate, or wise men, as, Hoc sunt instituta, qua Edgarus rex confilio sapientium suorum instituit; or to be enacted by those fates with the advice of the king: as, Hoc sunt judicia, qua sapientes confilio regis Ethelstheus influerunt; or, lastly, To be enacted by them both together, as, Hoc sunt institutiones, quas rex Edmundus et episcopi sui cum sapientibus suis instituerunt.\n\nThere is also no doubt but these great councils were occasionally held under the first princes of the Norman line. Glanvil, who wrote in the reign of Henry II., speaking of the particular amount of an emergence in the sheriffs' court, says, it had never yet been determined by the general assize or assembly, but was left to the custom of particular counties. Here the general assize is spoken of as a meeting well known, and its statutes or decisions are put in a manifest contradiction to custom, or to the common law. And in Edward III.'s time, an act of parliament, made in the reign of William the Conqueror, was pleaded in the case of the abbey of St. Edmund'sbury, and judicially allowed by the court.\n\nHence it indubitably appears, that parliaments, or general councils, are coeval with the kingdom itself. How those parliaments were constituted and composed, is another question, which has been matter of great dispute among our learned antiquarians; and particularly, whether the commons were summoned at all; or, if summoned, at what period they began to form a distinct assembly. But without entering into controversies of this sort, it may be sufficient to observe, that it is generally agreed, that in the main the constitution of parliament, as it now stands, was marked out so long ago as the 17th year of King John, A.D. 1215, in the great charter granted by that prince; wherein he promises to summon all archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, personally; and all other tenants in chief under the crown, by the sheriff and bailiffs; to meet at a certain place, with 30 days notice, to affix aids and scutages when necessary. And this constitution has subsisted in fact at least from the year 1266, 49 Henry III., there being still extant writs of that date, to summon knights, citizens, and burgesses, to parliament. We proceed therefore to inquire wherein consists this constitution of parliament, as it now stands, and has stood, for the space of at least 500 years. And in the prosecution of this inquiry, we shall consider, first, The manner and time of its assembling: Secondly, Its constituent parts: Thirdly, The laws and customs relating to parliament: Fourthly, The methods of proceeding, and of making statutes, in both houses: And, lastly, The manner of the parliament's adjournment: prorogation, and dissolution.\n\n1. As to the manner and time of assembling. The parliament is regularly to be summoned by the king's writ or letter, issued out of chancery by advice of the privy council, at least 40 days before it begins to sit. It is a branch of the royal prerogative, that no parliament can be convened by its own authority, or by the authority of any except the king alone. And this prerogative is founded upon very good reason. For supposing it had a right to meet spontaneously, without being called together, it is impossible to conceive that all the members, and each of the houses, would agree unanimously upon the proper time and place of meeting: and if half of the members met, and half absented themselves, who shall determine which is really the legislative body, the part assembled, or that which stays away? It is therefore necessary, that the parliament should be called together at a determinate time and place; and, highly becoming its dignity and independence, that it should be called together by none but one of its own constituent parts: and, of the three constituent parts, this office can only appertain to the king; as he is a single person, whose will may be uniform and steady; the first person in the nation, being superior to both houses in dignity; and the only branch of the legislature that has a separate existence, and is capable of performing any act at a time when no parliament is in being. Nor is it an exception to this rule, that, by some modern statutes, on the demise of a king or queen, if there be then no parliament in being, the last parliament revives, and is to sit again for six months, unless dissolved by the successor: for this revived parliament must have been originally summoned by the crown.\n\nIt is true, that the convention parliament which restored King Charles II. met above a month before his return; the lords by their own authority, and the commons in pursuance of writs issued in the name of the election to keepers of the liberty of England by authority of parliament; and that the said parliament sat till the 29th of December, full seven months after the Restoration; and enacted many laws, several of which are still in force. But this was for the necessity of the thing, which supercedes all law; for if they had not so met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been settled in peace. And the first thing done after the king's return was, to pass an act declaring this to be a good parliament, notwithstanding the defect of the king's writ. So that as the royal prerogative was chiefly wounded by their so meeting, and as the king himself, who alone had a right to object, consented to waive the objection, this cannot be drawn into an example in prejudice of the rights of the crown. Besides, we should also remember, that it was at that time a great doubt among the lawyers, whether even this healing act made it a good parliament, and held by very many in the negative; though it seems to have been too nice a scruple. And yet, out of abundant caution, it was thought necessary to confirm its acts in the next parliament, by statute 13 Car. II. c. 7. and c. 14.\n\nIt is likewise true, at the time of the Revolution of A.D. 1688, the lords and commons by their own authority, and upon the summons of the prince of Orange (afterwards King William), met in a convention, and therein disposed of the crown and kingdom. But it must be remembered, that this assembling was upon a like principle of necessity as at the Restoration; that is, upon a full conviction that King James II. had abdicated the government, and that the throne was thereby vacant: which supposition of the individual members was confirmed by their concurrent resolution, when they actually came together. And in such a case as the palpable vacancy of a throne, it follows, ex necessitate rei, that the\nParliament, form of the royal writs must be laid aside, otherwise no parliament can ever meet again. For let us put another possible case, and suppose, for the sake of argument, that the whole royal line should at any time fail, and become extinct, which would indisputably vacate the throne; in this situation it seems reasonable to presume, that the body of the nation, consisting of lords and commons, would have a right to meet and settle the government at all. And upon this and no other principle did the convention in 1688 assemble. The vacancy of the throne was precedent to their meeting without any royal summons, not a consequence of it. They did not assemble without writ, and then make the throne vacant; but, the throne being previously vacant by the king's abdication, they assembled without writ, as they must do if they assembled at all. Had the throne been full, their meeting would not have been regular; but, as it was really empty, such meeting became absolutely necessary.\n\nAnd accordingly, it is declared by statute i W. & M. stat. 1, c. 1, that this convention was really the two houses of parliament, notwithstanding the want of writs or other defects of form. So that, notwithstanding these two capital exceptions, which were justifiable only on a principle of necessity (and each of which, by the way, induced a revolution in the government), the rule laid down is in general certain, that the king only can convolve a parliament.\n\nAnd this, by the ancient statutes of the realm, he is bound to do every year, or oftener if need be. Not that he is, or ever was, obliged by these statutes to call a new parliament every year; but only to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of grievances, and despatch of business, if need be. These last words are so loose and vague, that such of our monarchs as were inclined to govern without parliaments, neglected the convoking them, sometimes for a very considerable period, under pretence that there was no need of them. But, to remedy this, by the statute 16 Car. II. c. 1, it is enacted, that the sitting and holding of parliaments shall not be intermitted above three years at the most. And by the statute i W. and M. ft. 2, c. 2, it is declared to be one of the rights of the people, that for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening, and preserving, the laws, parliaments ought to be held frequently. And this indefinite frequency is again reduced to a certainty by statute 6 W. & M. c. 2, which enacts, as the statute of Charles II. has done before, that a new parliament shall be called within three years after the determination of the former.\n\nII. The constituent parts of a parliament are, the king's majesty, fitting there in his royal political capacity, and the three estates of the realm; the lords spiritual, the lords temporal (who fit together with the king in one house), and the commons, who fit by themselves in another. And the king and these three estates together form the greater corporation or body politic of the kingdom, of which the king is said to be caput, principium, et finis. For upon their coming together the king meets them, either in person or by representation; without which there can be no beginning of a parliament; and he also has alone the power of dissolving them.\n\nIt is highly necessary for preserving the balance of the constitution, that the executive power should be a branch, though not the whole, of the legislature. The total union of them, we have seen, would be productive of tyranny; the total disjunction of them, for the present would in the end produce the same effects, by causing that union against which it seems to provide. The legislature would soon become tyrannical, by making continual encroachments, and gradually assuming to itself the rights of the executive power. Thus the long parliament of Charles I. while it acted in a constitutional manner, with the royal concurrence, redressed many heavy grievances and established many salutary laws. But when the two houses assumed the power of legislation, in exclusion of the royal authority, they soon after assumed likewise the reins of administration; and, in consequence of these united powers, overturned both church and state, and established a worse oppression than any they pretended to remedy. To hinder therefore any such encroachments, the king is himself a part of the parliament; and as this is the reason of his being so, very properly therefore the share of legislation which the constitution has placed in the crown, consists in the power of rejecting, rather than resolving; this being sufficient to answer the end professed. For we may apply to the royal negative, in this instance, what Cicero observes of the negative of the Roman tribunes, that the crown has not any power of doing wrong, but merely of preventing wrong from being done. The crown cannot begin of itself any alterations in the present established law; but it may approve or disapprove of the alterations suggested and consented to by the two houses. The legislature therefore cannot abridge the executive power of any rights which it now has by law, without its own consent; since the law must perpetually stand as it now does, unless all the powers will agree to alter it. And herein indeed consists the true excellence of the British government, that all the parts of it form a mutual check upon each other. In the legislature, the people are a check upon the nobility, and the nobility a check upon the people, by the mutual privilege of rejecting what the other has resolved; while the king is a check upon both, which preserves the executive power from encroachments. And this very executive power is again checked and kept within due bounds by the two houses, through the privilege they have of inquiring into, impeaching, and punishing the conduct (not indeed of the king, which would destroy his constitutional independence; but which is more beneficial to the public) of his evil and pernicious counsellors. Thus every branch of our civil polity supports and is supported, regulates and is regulated, by the rest: for the two houses naturally drawing in two directions of opposite interest, and the prerogative in another still different from them both, they mutually keep each other from exceeding their proper limits; while the whole is prevented from separation, and artificially connected together by the mixed nature of the crown, which is a part of the legislative, and the sole executive magistrate. Like three distinct powers in mechanics, they jointly impel the machine of government in a direction different from what either, acting by itself, would have done; but at the same time in a direction partaking of each, and formed out of all; a direction which constitutes the true line of the liberty and happiness of the community.\n\nHaving already considered these constituent parts of the\nParliament, the sovereign power, or parliament, each in a separate view, under the articles King, Lords, and Commons, to which the reader is referred, we proceed.\n\nIII. To examine the laws and customs relating to parliament, united together and considered as one aggregate body. The power and jurisdiction of parliament, says Sir Edward Coke, is so transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds. And of this high court he adds, it may be truly said, *Si antiquitatem spectes, eft vocatilifima; si dignitatem, eft honoratilifima; si juridicionem, eft capacilifima.* It hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal: this being the place where that absolute despotic power, which must in all governments reside somewhere, is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new-model the succession to the crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the established religion of the land; as was done in a variety of instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves; as was done by the act of Union, and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections. It can, in short, do every thing that is not naturally impossible; and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of parliament. True it is, that what the parliament doth, no authority upon earth can undo. So that it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this kingdom, that such members be delegated to this important trust as are most eminent for their probity, their fortitude, and their knowledge; for it was a known apophthegm of the great lord treasurer Burleigh, \"That England could never be ruined but by a parliament;\" and, as Sir Matthew Hale observes, this being the highest and greatest court, over which none other can have jurisdiction in the kingdom, if by any means a misgovernment should anyway fall upon it, the subjects of this kingdom are left without all manner of remedy. To the same purpose the President Montefquieu, though we trust too hastily, prefaces, that as Rome, Sparta, and Carthage, have lost their liberty and perished; so the constitution of England will in time lose its liberty, will perish: it will perish whenever the legislative power shall become more corrupt than the executive.\n\nIt must be owned, that Mr Locke, and other theoretical writers, have held, that \"there remains still inherent in the people a supreme power to remove or alter the legislature, when they find the legislature act contrary to the trust reposed in them:\" for when such trust is abused, it is thereby forfeited, and devolves to those who gave it.\" But however just this conclusion may be in theory, we cannot adopt it, or argue from it, under any dispensation of government at present actually existing. For this deviation of power, to the people at large, includes in it a dissolution of the whole form of government established, by that people; reduces all the members to their original state of equality; and by annihilating the sovereign power, repeal all positive laws whatsoever before enacted. No human laws will therefore suppose a case, which at once must destroy all law, and compel men to build anew upon a new foundation; nor will they make provision for so desperate an event, as must render all legal provisions ineffectual. So long therefore as the English constitution lasts, we may venture to affirm, that the power of parliament is absolute and without control.\n\nIn order to prevent the mischiefs that might arise, by placing this extensive authority in hands that are either incapable or else improper to manage it, it is provided by the custom and law of parliament, that no one shall sit or vote in either house, unless he be 21 years of age. This is also expressly declared by statute 7 & 8 W. III. c. 25: with regard to the house of commons, doubts have arisen, from some contradictory adjudications, whether or not a minor was incapacitated from sitting in that house. It is also enacted by statute 7 Jac. I. c. 6, that no member be permitted to enter the house of commons till he hath taken the oath of allegiance before the lord steward or his deputy: and by 30 Car. II. st. 2. and 1 Geo. I. c. 13, that no member shall vote or sit in either house, till he hath, in the presence of the house, taken the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, and subscribed and repeated the declaration against transubstantiation, and invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. Aliens, unless naturalized, were likewise by the law of parliament incapable to serve therein: and now it is enacted, by statute 12 & 13 W. III. c. 2, that no alien, even though he be naturalized, shall be capable of being a member of either house of parliament. And there are not only these standing incapacities; but if any person is made a peer by the king, or elected to serve in the house of commons by the people, yet may the respective houses, upon complaint of any crime in such person, and proof thereof, adjudge him disabled and incapable to sit as a member: and this by the law and custom of parliament.\n\nFor as every court of justice hath laws and customs for its direction, some the civil and canon, some the forms of common law, others their own peculiar laws and custom; so the high court of parliament hath also its own peculiar law, called the lex et consuetudo parliamenti; a law which Sir Edward Coke observes is *ab exprimis omnibus quaerenda, a multis ignorata, a paucis cognita.* It will not therefore be expected that we should enter into the examination of this law with any degree of minuteness; since, as the same learned author affirms us, it is much better to be learned out of the rolls of parliament and other records, and by precedents and continual experience, than can be expressed by any one man. It will be sufficient to observe, that the whole of the law and custom of parliament has its original from this one maxim, \"That whatever matter arises concerning either house of parliament, ought to be examined, discussed, and adjudged in that house to which it relates, and not elsewhere.\" Hence, for instance, the lords will not suffer the commons to interfere in the settling the election of a peer in Scotland; the commons will not allow the lords to judge of the election of a burgess; nor will either house permit the subordinate courts of law to examine the merits of either case. But the maxims\nThe privileges of parliament are likewise very large and indefinite; and therefore, when in 31st Hen. VI., the house of lords propounded a question to the judges concerning them, the chief justice, Sir John Fortescue, in the name of his brethren, declared, \"That they ought not to make answer to that question; for it hath not been used aforetime, that the justices should in any wise determine the privileges of the high court of parliament; for it is so high and mighty in its nature, that it may make law; and that which is law, it may make no law; and the determination and knowledge of that privilege belong to the lords of parliament, and not to the justices.\" Privilege of parliament was principally established, in order to protect its members not only from being molested by their fellow-subjects, but also more especially from being oppressed by the power of the crown. If therefore all the privileges of parliament were once to be set down and ascertained, and no privilege to be allowed but what was so defined and determined, it were easy for the executive power to devise some new case, not within the line of privilege, and under pretence thereof to harass any refractory member, and violate the freedom of parliament. The dignity and independence of the two houses are therefore in great measure preserved by keeping their privileges indefinite. Some, however, of the more notorious privileges of the members of either house are, privileges of speech, of person, of their domestics, and of their lands and goods. As to the first privilege of speech, it is declared by the statute 1 W. and M. st. 2, c. 2, as one of the liberties of the people, \"That the freedom of speech, and debates, and proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament.\" And this freedom of speech is particularly demanded of the king in person, by the speaker of the house of commons, at the opening of every new parliament. So likewise are the other privileges, of person, servants, lands, and goods; which are immunities as ancient as Edward the Confessor: in whose laws we find this precept, ad synodos veniuntibus, five summonem sint, five per se quod agendum habuerint, fit somnia pax; and so too in the old Gothic constitutions, Extendatur habe pax et securitas ad quattuordecim dies, convocato regni senatu. This included formerly not only privilege from illegal violence, but also from legal arrests and seizures by process from the courts of law. And still to assault by violence a member of either house, or his menial servants, is a high contempt of parliament, and there punished with the utmost severity. It has likewise peculiar penalties annexed to it in the courts of law by the statutes 5 Hen. IV. c. 6, and 11 Hen. VI. c. 11. Neither can any member of either house be arrested and taken into custody without a breach of the privilege of parliament.\n\nBut all other privileges which derogate from the common law are now at an end, save only as to the freedom of the member's person; which in a peer (by the privilege of peage) is for ever sacred and inviolable; and in a commoner (by the privilege of parliament) for forty days after every prorogation, and forty days before the next appointed meeting; which is now in effect as long as the parliament subsists, it seldom being prorogued for more than 84 days at a time. As to all other privileges which obstruct the ordinary course of justice, they were restrained by the statutes 12 W. III. c. 3, 2 and 3 Ann. c. 18, and 11 Geo. II. c. 24, and are now totally abolished by statute 10 G. III. c. 50; which enacts, that any suit may at any time be brought against any peer or member of parliament, their servants, or any other person entitled to privilege of parliament; which shall not be impeached or delayed by pretence of any such privilege, except that the person of a member of the house of commons shall not thereby be subjected to any arrest or imprisonment. Likewise, for the benefit of commerce, it is provided by statute 4 Geo. III. c. 33, that any trader, having privilege of parliament, may be served with legal process for any just debt (to the amount of £100); and unless he makes satisfaction within two months, it shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy; and that commissions of bankruptcy may be issued against such privileged traders in like manner as against any other.\n\nThe only way by which courts of justice could annul the privilege of parliament, was by writ of privilege, in the nature of a supersedeas, to refund; but deliver the party out of custody when arrested in a civil suit. For when a letter was written by the speaker to the judges, to stay proceedings against a privileged person, they rejected it as contrary to their oath of office, the cause, But since the statute 12 Will. III. c. 3, which enacts, that no privileged person shall be subject to arrest or imprisonment, it hath been held, that such arrest is irregular ab initio, and that the party may be discharged upon motion. It is to be observed, that there is no precedent of any such writ of privilege, but only in civil suits; and that the statute of 1 Jac. I. c. 13, and that of King William (which remedy some inconveniences arising from privilege of parliament), speak only of civil actions. And therefore the claim of privilege hath been usually guarded with an exception as to the case of indictable crimes; or, as it hath been frequently expressed, of treason, felony, and breach (or surety) of the peace. Whereby it seems to have been understood, that no privilege was allowable to the members, their families, or servants, in any crime, whatsoever; for all crimes are treated by the law as being contra pacem domini regis. And instances have not been wanting, wherein privileged persons have been convicted of misdemeanors, and committed, or prosecuted to outlawry, even in the middle of a session; which proceeding has afterwards received the sanction and approbation of parliament. To which may be added, that a few years ago, the case of writing and publishing seditious libels was resolved by both houses not to be entitled to privilege; and that the reasons upon which that case proceeded, extended equally to every indictable offence. So that the chief, if not the only, privilege of parliament, in such cases, seems to be the right of receiving immediate information of the imprisonment or detention of any member, with the reason for which he is detained: a practice that is daily used upon the slightest military accusations, preparatory to a trial by a court martial; and which is recognized by the several temporary statutes for suspending the habeas corpus act: whereby it is provided, that no member of either house shall be detained, till the matter of which he stands suspected be first communicated to the house of which he is a member, and the consent of the said\nBut yet the usage has uniformly been, ever since the Revolution, that the communication has been subsequent to the arrest.\n\nThese are the general heads of the laws and customs relating to parliament, considered as one aggregate body. The laws and customs relating to each branch in particular being explained under the articles already referred to, viz. King, Lords, and Commons, we should proceed, IV. To the method of making laws; which is much the same in both houses. But for this, too, we have to refer the reader to the article Bill; and shall only observe in this place, that, for despatch of business, each house of parliament has its speaker. The speaker of the house of lords, whose office it is to preside there, and manage the formality of business, is the lord chancellor or keeper of the king's great seal, or any other appointed by the king's commission: and if none be appointed, the house of lords (it is said) may elect.—The speaker of the house of commons is chosen by the house; but must be approved by the king. And herein the usage of the two houses differs, that the speaker of the house of commons cannot give his opinion or argue any question in the house; but the speaker of the house of lords, if a lord of parliament, may. In each house the act of the majority binds the whole; and this majority is declared by votes openly and publicly given; not, as at Venice, and many other senatorial assemblies, privately, or by ballot. This latter method may be serviceable, to prevent intrigues and unconstitutional combinations; but it is impossible to be practised with us, at least in the house of commons, where every member's conduct is subject to the future censure of his constituents, and therefore should be openly submitted to their inspection.\n\nV. There remains only, in the last place, to add a word or two concerning the manner in which parliament may be adjourned, prorogued, or dissolved.\n\nAn adjournment is no more than a continuance of the session from one day to another; as the word itself signifies; and this is done by the authority of each house separately every day; and sometimes for a fortnight or a month together, as at Christmas or Easter, or upon other particular occasions. But the adjournment of one house is no adjournment of the other. It hath also been usual, when his majesty hath signified his pleasure, that both or either of the houses should adjourn themselves to a certain day, to obey the king's pleasure so signified, and to adjourn accordingly.—Otherwise, besides the indecorum of a refusal, a prorogation would assuredly follow; which would often be very inconvenient to both public and private business. For prorogation puts an end to the session; and then such bills as are only begun, and not perfected, must be resumed de novo (if at all) in a subsequent session; whereas, after an adjournment, all things continue in the same state as at the time of the adjournment made, and may be proceeded on without any fresh commencement.\n\nA prorogation is the continuance of the parliament from one session to another; as an adjournment is a continuation of the session from day to day. This is done by the royal authority, expressed either by the lord chancellor in his majesty's presence, or by commission from the crown, or frequently by proclamation. Both houses are necessarily prorogued at the same time; it not being a prorogation of the house of lords or commons, but of Parliament. The session is never understood to be at an end until a prorogation; though, unless some act be passed, or some judgement given in parliament, it is in truth no session at all. And formerly the usage was, for the king to give the royal assent to all such bills as he approved at the end of every session, and then to prorogue the parliament, though sometimes only for a day or two; after which all business then depending in the houses was to be begun again. Which custom obtained so strongly, that it once became a question, Whether giving the royal assent to a single bill did not of course put an end to the session? And though it was then resolved in the negative, yet the notion was so deeply rooted, that the statute 1 Car. I. c. 7, was passed to declare, that the king's assent to that and some other acts should not put an end to the session; and even to late in the reign of Charles II, we find a proviso frequently tacked to a bill, that his majesty's assent thereto should not determine the session of parliament. But it now seems to be allowed, that a prorogation must be expressly made, in order to determine the session. And if at the time of an actual rebellion, or imminent danger of invasion, the parliament shall be separated by adjournment or prorogation, the king is empowered to call them together by proclamation, with 14 days notice of the time appointed for their reassembling.\n\nA dissolution is the civil death of the parliament; and Parliament may be effected three ways: 1. By the king's will, is dissolved by the expressed either in person or by representation. For as the king has the sole right of convoking the parliament, so also it is a branch of the royal prerogative, that he may (whenever he pleases) prorogue the parliament for a time, or put a final period to its existence. If nothing had a right to prorogue or dissolve a parliament but itself, it might happen to become perpetual. And this would be extremely dangerous, if at any time it should attempt to encroach upon the executive power; as was fatally experienced by the unfortunate King Charles I.; who, having unadvisedly passed an act to continue the parliament then in being till such time as it should please to dissolve itself, at last fell a sacrifice to that inordinate power which he himself had consented to give them. It is therefore extremely necessary that the crown should be empowered to regulate the duration of these assemblies, under the limitations which the English constitution has prescribed: so that, on the one hand, they may frequently and regularly come together for the despatch of business and redress of grievances; and may not, on the other, even with the consent of the crown, be continued to an inconvenient or unconstitutional length.\n\n2. A parliament may be dissolved by the demise of or in consequence of the crown. This dissolution formerly happened immediately upon the death of the reigning sovereign: for he being considered in law as the head of the parliament, (caput, principium, et finis), that failing, the whole body was held to be extinct. But the calling a new parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found inconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament in being in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted by the statutes 7 and 8 Wm. III. c. 15, and 6 Ann. c. 7, that the parliament in being shall continue for six months after the death of any king or queen, unless sooner prorogued or disso-\nved by the successor; that if the parliament be, at the time of the king's death, separated, by adjournment or prorogation, it shall notwithstanding assemble immediately: and that if no parliament is then in being, the members of the last parliament shall assemble and be again a parliament.\n\n3. Lastly, A parliament may be dissolved or expire by length of time. For if either the legislative body were perpetual, or might last for the life of the prince who convened them as formerly, and were so to be supplied, by occasionally filling the vacancies with new representatives; in these cases, if it were once corrupted, the evil would be past all remedy; but when different bodies succeed each other, if the people see cause to disapprove of the present, they may rectify its faults in the next. A legislative assembly also, which is sure to be separated again, (whereby its members will themselves become private men, and subject to the full extent of the laws which they have enacted for others,) will think themselves bound, in interest as well as duty, to make only such laws as are good. The utmost extent of time that the same parliament was allowed to sit, by the statute 6 W. and M. c. 3., was three years: after the expiration of which, reckoning from the return of the first summons, the parliament was to have no longer continuance. But by the statute 1 Geo. I. stat. 2. c. 38. (in order, professedly, to prevent the great and continued expenses of frequent elections, and the violent heats and animosities consequent thereon, and for the peace and security of the government then just recovering from the late rebellion), this term was prolonged to seven years; and, what alone is an instance of the vast authority of parliament, the very same house that was chosen for three years, enacted its own continuance for seven. So that, as our constitution now stands, the parliament must expire, or die a natural death, at the end of every seventh year, if not sooner dissolved by the royal prerogative.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with an account of some general forms not taken notice of under any of the above heads.\n\nIn the house of lords, the princes of the blood sit by themselves on the sides of the throne; at the wall, on the king's right hand, the two archbishops sit by themselves on a form. Below them, the bishops of London, Durham, and Winchester, and all the other bishops, sit according to the priority of their consecration. On the king's left hand the lord treasurer, lord president, and lord privy seal, sit upon forms above, all dukes, except the royal blood; then the dukes, marquises, and earls, according to their creation. Across the room are wool sacks, continued from an ancient custom; and the chancellor, or keeper, being of course the speaker of the house of lords, sits on the first wool sack before the throne, with the great seal or mace lying by him; below these are forms for the viceroys and barons. On the other wool sacks are seated the judges, masters in chancery, and king's council, who are only to give their advice in points of law; but they all stand up till the king gives them leave to sit.\n\nThe commons sit promiscuously; only the speaker has a chair at the upper end of the house, and the clerk and his affiant fit at a table near him.\n\nWhen a member of the house of commons speaks, he stands up uncovered, and directs his speech to the speaker only. If what he says be answered by another, he is not allowed to reply the same day, unless personal reflections have been cast upon him: but when the commons, in order to have a greater freedom of debate, have resolved themselves into a committee of the whole house, every member may speak to a question as often as he thinks necessary. In the house of lords they vote, beginning at the highest or lowest baron, and go up orderly to the highest, every one answering, Content or Not content. In the house of commons they vote by yeas and nays; and if it be dubious which are the greater number, the house divides. If the question be about bringing anything into the house, the yeas go out, but if it be about anything the house already has, the nays go out. In all divisions the speaker appoints four tellers, two of each opinion. In a committee of the whole house, they divide by changing sides, the year taking the right and the nays the left of the chair; and then there are but two tellers. If a bill passes one house, and the other demur to it, a conference is demanded in the painted chamber, where certain members are deputed from each house; and here the lords fit covered, and the commons stand bare, and debate the case. If they disagree, the affair is null; but if they agree, this, with the other bills that have passed both houses, is brought down to the king in the house of lords, who comes thither clothed in his royal robes; before him the clerk of the parliament reads the title of each bill, and as he reads, the clerk of the crown pronounces the royal assent or dissent. If it be a public bill, the royal assent is Manner of given in these words, Le roy le veut, \"The king will express it so;\" if private, Soit fait comme il est défié, \"Let the request be complied with;\" if the king refuses the bill, the answer is, Le roy s'avisera, \"The king will think of it;\" and if it be a money bill, the answer is, Le roy remercie ses loyaux sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ouffle le veut, \"The king thanks his loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence, and therefore grants his consent.\"\n\nHigh Court of Parliament, is the supreme court in the kingdom, not only for the making, but also for the execution of laws; by the trial of great and enormous offenders, whether lords or commoners, in the method of parliamentary impeachment. As for acts of parliament to attain particular persons of treason or felony, or to inflict pains and penalties, beyond or contrary to the common law, to serve a special purpose, we speak not of them; being to all intents and purposes new laws, made pro re nata, and by no means an execution of such as are already in being. But an impeachment before the lords by the commons of Great Britain, in parliament, is a prosecution of the already known and established law, and has been frequently put in practice; being a presentment to the most high and supreme court of criminal jurisdiction by the most solemn grand inquest of the whole kingdom. A commoner cannot, however, be impeached before the lords for any capital offence, but only for high misdemeanors; a peer may be impeached for any crime. And they usually (in case of an impeachment of a peer for treason) address the crown to appoint a lord high steward, for the greater dignity and regularity of their proceedings; which high steward was formerly elected by the peers themselves, though he was generally commissioned by the king; but it hath of late years been frequently maintained, that the appointment\nment of a high steward in such cases is not indispensably necessary, but that the house may proceed without one. The articles of impeachment are a kind of bills of indictment, found by the house of commons, and afterwards tried by the lords; who are in cases of misdemeanors considered not only as their own peers, but as the peers of the whole nation. This is a custom derived to us from the constitution of the ancient Germans; who in their great councils sometimes tried capital accusations relating to the public: *Liceat apud concilium acculare quoque, et differim capitum intendere.* And it has a peculiar propriety in the English constitution; which has much improved upon the ancient model imported hither from the continent. For though in general the union of the legislative and judicial powers ought to be most carefully avoided, yet it may happen that a subject, intrusted with the administration of public affairs, may infringe the rights of the people, and be guilty of such crimes as the ordinary magistrate either dares not or cannot punish. Of these the representatives of the people, or house of commons, cannot properly judge; because their constituents are the parties injured, and can therefore only impeach. But before what court shall this impeachment be tried? Not before the ordinary tribunals, which would naturally be swayed by the authority of so powerful an accuser. Reason therefore will suggest, that this branch of the legislature, which represents the people, must bring its charge before the other branch, which consists of the nobility, who have neither the same interests, nor the same passions, as popular assemblies. This is a vast superiority which the constitution of this island enjoys over those of the Grecian or Roman republics; where the people were at the same time both judges and accusers. It is proper that the nobility should judge, to ensure justice to the accused; as it is proper that the people should accuse, to ensure justice to the commonwealth. And therefore, among other extraordinary circumstances attending the authority of this court, there is one of a very singular nature, which was insisted on by the house of commons in the case of the earl of Danby in the reign of Chas. II. and is now enacted by statute 12 and 13 W. III. c. 2. that no pardon under the great seal shall be pleaded to an impeachment by the commons of Great Britain in parliament.\n\nSuch is the nature of a British parliament, and in theory at least we should presume it were nearly perfect; but some of our fellow countrymen, more zealous perhaps than wise, see prodigious faults in it, such indeed as they think must inevitably prove fatal. The consequence of this persuasion has been a loud and incessant call for parliamentary reform. That abuses ought to be reformed, is certain; and that few institutions are so perfect as not to need amendment, is a fact equally indisputable. We shall even suppose that there are many abuses in our parliament which would require to be amended; but, granting all this, and something more if it were necessary, we would recommend in the mean time to the serious consideration of those who call themselves the Friends of the People, whose sincerity in their professions it would be impolite to question; the example of France, and that they would allow it to be a warning to Britain. France wanted reform indeed, and that which was first proposed had the countenance of the coolest and the best of men; but the consequences have been dreadful; and if ever a free and stable government take place in it, which we sincerely wish may be soon, it will have been purchased at an immense price, by enormities which will disgrace it whilst the remembrance of them lasts.\n\nThe former PARLIAMENTS of France were sovereign courts established by the king, finally to determine all disputes between particular persons, and to pronounce on appeals from sentences given by inferior judges. There were ten of these parliaments in France, of which that of Paris was the chief, its privileges and jurisdiction being of the greatest extent. It consisted of eight chambers: the grand chamber, where causes of audience were pleaded; the chamber of written law; the chamber of counsel; the Tournelle criminelle, for judging criminal affairs; the Tournelle civile, in aid of the grand chamber; and three chambers of inquests, where proceedings were adjudged in writing; besides these, there was also the chamber of vacations, and those of requets. In 1771 the king thought fit to branch the parliament of Paris into six different parliaments, under the denomination of superior courts, each parliament having similar jurisdiction. Under their second race of kings, this parliament, like that of England, was the king's council; it gave audience to ambassadors, and consulted of the affairs of war and government. The king, like ours, at that time presided in them, without being at all master of their resolutions. But in after times their authority was abridged; as the kings referred the decision of the grand affairs of the public to their own councils; leaving none but private ones to the parliaments. The parliament of Paris also enjoyed the privileges of verifying and registering the king's arrests or edicts, without which those edicts were of little or no value.\n\nPARLIAMENT of Sweden, consists of four estates, with the king at their head. These estates are, 1. The nobility and representatives of the gentry; with whom the colonels, lieutenant colonels, majors, and captains of every regiment, sit and vote. 2. The clergy; one of which body is elected from every rural deanery of ten parishes; who, with the bishops and superintendents, amount to about 200. 3. The burgheers, elected by the magistrates and council of every corporation as their representatives, of whom there are four for Stockholm, and two for every other town, amounting in the whole to about 150. 4. The peasants, chosen by the peasants out of every district; who choose one of their own rank, and not a gentleman, to represent them: these amount to about 250.\n\nAll these generally meet at Stockholm: and after the state affairs have been represented to them from the throne, they separate, and sit in four several chambers or houses, in each of which affairs are carried on by majority of votes; and every chamber has a negative in the passing any law.\n\nPARMA, an ancient, rich, populous, and handsome town of Italy, capital of the duchy of the same name, with a citadel, a bishop's see, and an university. It has a magnificent cathedral, and the largest opera house in Europe, which has seats for 8000 people; but as it required a vast number of candles, which occasioned great expense, they have contrived another which has room for 2000 spectators. The dome and the church of St John are painted by the famous Correggio, who was a native of this place. Don Carlos, king of the two Sicilies, carried\nParma carried away the library to Naples, which contained 18,000 volumes, and a very valuable cabinet of curiosities, as also the rich collection of medals. The citadel, which is very near the city, is built in the same taste as that at Antwerp. In 1734 there was a bloody battle fought here; and in 1741, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, were given to Don Philip, brother to Don Carlos above mentioned. It is 30 miles south-east of Cremona, and 60 south-east of Milan. E. Long. 10° 51'. N. Lat. 44° 50'.\n\nParma, the duchy of, a province of Italy, bounded on the north by the Po; on the north-east by the Mantuan; on the east by the duchy of Modena; on the south by Tuscany; and on the west by the duchy of Placentia. The air is very wholesome, on which account the inhabitants live to a great age. The soil is very fertile in corn, wine, oil, and hemp; the pastures feed a great number of cattle, and the cheese is in very high esteem. Here are considerable mines of copper and silver.\n\nParmesan cheese, a sort of cheese much esteemed among the Italians; so named from the duchy of Parma where it is made, and whence it is conveyed to various parts of Europe.\n\nThe excellent pasture grounds of this country are watered by the Po; and the cows from whose milk this cheese is made yield a great quantity of it. Of this cheese there are three sorts; the fromaggio di forma, about two palms in diameter, and seven or eight inches thick; and the fromaggio di rilievo and di ribolini, which are not so large. This cheese is of a saffron colour; and the best is kept three or four years. See Cheese.\n\nParmigiano, a celebrated painter, whose true name was Francesco Mazzuoli; but he received the former from the city of Parma, where he was born, in 1504. He was brought up under his two uncles, and was an eminent painter when but 16 years of age. He was famous all over Italy at 19; and at 23 performed such wonders, that when the general of the emperor Charles V. took Rome by storm, some of the common soldiers having, in facking the town broke into his apartments, found him intent upon his work, and were instantly struck with the beauty of his pieces, that instead of involving him in the plunder and destruction in which they were then employed, they resolved to protect him from all manner of violence; which they actually performed. His works are distinguished by the beauty of the colouring, the invention, and drawing. His figures are spirited and graceful, particularly with respect to the choice of attitude, and in their dresses. He also excelled in music, in which he much delighted.\n\nIn large compositions Parmigiano did not always reach a high degree of excellence; but in his holy families, and other similar subjects, the gracefulness of his heads, and the elegance of his attitudes, are peculiarly delightful. For the celebrity of his name he seems to be chiefly indebted to his numerous drawings and etchings; for his life being short, and a great part of it consumed in the idle study of alchemy, in pursuit of the philosopher's stone, and in the seducing avocations of music and gambling, there was but little time left for application to the laborious part of his business. His paintings in oil are few in number, and held in high esteem, as are also his drawings and etchings; good impressions of Parmigiano's last being very rarely to be found. He was the first that practised the art of etching in Italy; and probably he did not at first know, that it had been for some years practised in Germany. When he set out for Rome, he was advised to take some of his pictures with him, as a means of getting himself introduced into the acquaintance of the nobility and artists in that celebrated city. One of them is mentioned by his biographers as a masterpiece. It was his own portrait painted upon a piece of wood of a convex form, in imitation of a convex mirror. The surface is said to have been so wonderfully executed, that it had the appearance of real glass, and the head, as well as every part of the furniture of the chamber in which he was supposed to sit, was so artfully managed, that the whole formed a very complete piece of deception. At Rome he was employed by Pope Clement VII., who was highly pleased with his performances, and rewarded him liberally. A crucifixion which he painted for him was particularly esteemed as a capital work. In it Parmigiano was successful in introducing a variety of lights, without destroying the general harmony. When Charles V. came to Bologna to be crowned emperor of the Romans, Parmigiano failed not to be present at that singular ceremony; and so accurately marked the countenance of the emperor, that at his return home, he was enabled from memory to make out a surprising likeness. In the same piece he introduced the figure of Fame placing a crown of laurel on the head of the emperor, whilst a young Hercules presented him with a globe of the world. Before it was quite finished, the painter and his piece were introduced to Charles by the Pope, but to little purpose; for the emperor left Bologna a few days after, without ordering him any recompense for his labour. In the church of Madonna della Stercato at Parma are still to be seen several of the works of this artist; among which one of Sibyls, and two others of Moles, and of Adam and Eve, are much admired. So also is a Dead Christ, with the Virgin in sorrow, in the church of the Dominicans at Cremona. In the Houghton collection of pictures, now in possession of the empress of Russia, is one of his best pictures, representing Christ laid in the sepulchre, for which he is said to have been knighted by the duke of Parma. His principal works are at Parma, where he died poor in 1540.\n\nParnassus, grass of Parnassus; a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clas. See Botany Index.\n\nParnassus (Strabo, Pindar, Virgil), a mountain of Phocis, near Delphi, and the mounts Cithaeron and Helicon, with two tops (Ovid, Lucan); the one called Cirrha, sacred to Apollo; and the other Nysa, sacred to Bacchus (Juvenal). It was covered with bay trees (Virgil); and originally called Larnassus, from Deucalion's larnax or ark, thither conveyed by the flood, (Stephanus, Scholiast on Apollonius); after the flood, Parnassus; from Har Nahas, changing the h into p, the hill of divination or augury (Peucerus); the oracle of Delphi standing at its foot.\n\nChandler *, who visited it, thus describes it:—“Par* Travels nassus was the western boundary of Phocis, and stretch-in Greece, ing northward from about Delphi toward the Oetaean mountains, separated the western Locri from those who possessed the sea coast before Euboea. It was a place of refuge\nrefuge to the Delphians in times of danger. In the deluge, which happened under Deucalion, the natives were saved on it by following the cry of wolves. On the invasion by Xerxes, some transported their families over to Achaia, but many concealed them in the mountain, and in Corycium, a grotto of the Nymphs. All Parnassus was renowned for sanctity, but Corycium was the most noted among the hallowed caves and places. On the way to the summit of Parnassus, says Paulanias, as much as 60 stadia beyond Delphi, is a brazen image; and from thence the ascent to Corycium is easier for a man on foot, and for mules and horses. Of all the caves in which I have been, this appeared to me the best worth seeing. On the coasts, and by the sea side, are more than can be numbered; but some are very famous both in Greece and in other countries. The Corycian cave exceeds in magnitude those I have mentioned, and for the most part may be passed through without a light. It is sufficiently high: and has water, some springing up, and yet more from the roof, which petrifies; so that the bottom of the whole cave is covered with sparry icicles. The inhabitants of Parnassus esteem it sacred to the Corycian Nymphs, and particularly to Pan.—From the cave to reach the summits of the mountain is difficult even to a man on foot. The summits are above the clouds, and the women called Thyiades madden on them in the rites of Bacchus and Apollo. Their frantic orgies were performed yearly. Wheler and his company ascended Parnassus from Delphi, some on horses, by a track between the stadium and the cliffs of the mountain. Stairs were cut in the rock, with a strait channel, perhaps a water duct.—In a long hour, after many traverses, they gained the top, and entering a plain turned to the right, towards the summits of Cattalia, which are divided by deep precipices. From this eminence they had a fine prospect of the gulf of Corinth, and of the coast; Mount Cirphis appearing beneath them as a plain, bounded on the east by the bay of Alfofotia, and on the west by that of Salona. A few shepherds had huts there. They returned to the way which they had quitted, and crossed a hill covered with pines and snow. On their left was a lake, and beyond it a peak, exceedingly high, white with snow. They travelled to the foot of it through a valley, four or five miles in compass; and rested by a plentiful fountain called Drosionis, the stream boiling up a foot in diameter, and nearly as much above the surface of the ground. It runs into the lake, which is about a quarter of a mile distant to the south-east. They did not discover Corycium, or proceed farther on, but keeping the lake on their right, came again to the brink of the mountain, and descended by a deep and dangerous track to Raco-vi, a village four or five miles eastward from Delphi. It was the opinion of Wheler, that no mountain in Greece was higher than Parnassus; that it was not inferior to Mount Cenis among the Alps; and that, if detached, it would be seen at a greater distance than even Mount Athos. The summits are perpetually increasing, every new fall of snow adding to the perennial heap, while the sun has power only to thaw the supercicies. Cattalis Pleistus and innumerable springs are fed, some invisibly, from the lakes and reservoirs, which, without these drains and subterranean vents, would swell, especially after heavy rain and the melting of snow, so as to fill the valleys, and run over the tops of the rocks down upon Delphi, spreading wide an inundation, similar, as has been surmised, to the Deucalonian deluge.”\n\nPARNELL, Dr Thomas, a very ingenious divine and poet in the early part of the 18th century. He was archdeacon of Clogher, and the intimate friend of Mr Pope; who published his works, with an elegant copy of recommendatory verses prefixed. He died in 1718, aged 39.\n\nJohnson says, “The life of Dr Parnell is a task which I should very willingly decline, since it has been lately written by Goldsmith, a man of such variety of powers, and such facility of performance, that he always seemed to do best that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediousness, and general without confusion; whose language was copious without exuberance, exact without constraint, and easy without weakness.\n\n“What such an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an extract from his larger narrative; and shall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius.\n\n“To yag yagis iei Sarvou.”\n\n“The general character of Parnell is not great extent of comprehension, or fertility of mind. Of the little that appears still less is his own. His praise must be derived from the easy sweetness of his diction: in his verses there is more happiness than pain; he is frightfully without effort, and always delights though he never ravishes; every thing is proper, yet every thing seems casual. If there is some appearance of elaboration in the Hermit, the narrative, as it is less airy, is less pleasing. Of his other compositions, it is impossible to say whether they are the productions of Nature to excellent as not to want the help of Art, or of Art to refine as to resemble Nature.”\n\nPARODICAL DEGREES, in an equation, a term sometimes used to denote the several regular terms in a quadratic, cubic, biquadratic, &c., equation, when the indices of the powers ascend or descend orderly in an arithmetical progression. Thus, $x^3 + mx^2 + nx = p$ is a cubic equation where no term is wanting, but having all its parodic degrees; the indices of the terms regularly descending thus, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nPARODY, a popular maxim, adage, or proverb.\n\nPARODY, is also a poetical pleasurable, consisting in applying the verses written on one subject, by way of ridicule, to another; or in turning a serious work into a burlesque, by affecting to observe as near as possible the same rhymes, words, and cadences.\n\nThe parody was first set on foot by the Greeks; from whom we borrow the name. It comes near to what some of our late writers call travesty. Others have more accurately distinguished between a parody and burlesque; and they observe, that the change of a single word may parody a verse; or of a single letter a word. Thus, in the last case, Cato exposed the inconstant disposition of Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, by changing Nobilior into Mobilior.

See SURGERY Index.\n\nPAROS, in Ancient Geography, an island of the Aegean sea, one of the Cyclades, with a strong cognominal town, 38 miles distant from Delos (Pliny, Nepos). Anciently called Patrye and Minou (Pliny); also Demetrias, Zacynthus, Hyria, Hyleeifa, and Cabarnis (Nicanor). The country of Archilocheus the iambic poet (Strabo). An island famous for its white marble (Virgil, Horace, Ovid), called lychnites, because dug with lamps (Pliny). The name of Cabarnis is borrowed, according to Stephanus, from one Cabarnus, who first informed Ceres of the rape of her daughter Proserpine; or, according to Hesychius, from the Cabarni, the priests of Ceres being so called by the inhabitants of this island. The name of Minoua is borrowed from Minos king of Crete, who founded this, as he did most of the other islands of the Aegean sea. It was called Paros, which name it retains to this day, from Paros the son of Parrhasius, or, as Stephanus will have it, of Jason the Argonaut. Paros, according to Pliny's computation, is distant from Naxos seven miles and a half, and 28 from Delos. Some modern travellers suppose that it is 80, others only 50 miles in compass. Pliny says it is half as large as Naxos, that is, between 36 and 37 miles in compass. It was a rich and powerful island, being termed the most wealthy and happy of the Cyclades, and by Cornelius Nepos an island elated with its riches. The city of Paros, the metropolis, is styled by Stephanus a potent city, and one of the largest in the Archipelago: the present city of Paros, now Parichia, is supposed to have been built upon its ruins, the country abounding with valuable monuments of antiquity. The very walls of the present city are built with columns, architraves, pedestals, mingled with pieces of ancient marble of a surprising magnitude, which were once employed in more noble edifices. Paros was indeed formerly famous for its marble, which was of an extraordinary whiteness, and in such request among the ancients that the best statuaries used no other (A). The island is provided with several capacious and safe harbours, and was anciently much resorted to by traders. It was, according to Thucydides, originally peopled by the Phoenicians, who were the first masters of the sea. Afterwards the Carian settlers came here, as we are told by Thucydides and Diodorus. But these two authors differ as to the time when the Carian came first into the island; for Thucydides tells us, that the Carians were driven out by the Cretans under the conduct of Minos; and Diodorus writes, that the Carians did not settle here till after the Trojan war, when they found the Cretans in possession of the island. Stephanus thinks that the Cretans, mixed with some Arcadians, were the only people that ever possessed this island. Minos himself if we believe Pliny, resided some time in the island of Paros, and received here the melancholy news of the death of his son Androgeus, who was killed in Attica after he had distinguished himself at the public games. We find the inhabitants of this island chosen from among all the Greeks by the Milesians to compose the differences which had for two generations rent that unhappy state into parties and factions. They acquitted themselves with great prudence, and reformed the government. They assisted Darius in his expedition against Greece with a considerable squadron; but after the victory obtained by Miltiades at Marathon, they were reduced to great straits by that general. However, after blocking up the city for 26 days, he was obliged to quit the enterprise, and return to Athens with disgrace. Upon his departure, the Parians were informed that Timo, a priest of the national gods, and then his prisoner, had advised him to perform some secret ceremony in the temple of Ceres, near the city; assuring him that he would thereby gain the place. Upon this information they sent deputies to consult the oracle of Delphi, whether they should punish her with death, for endeavouring to betray the city to the enemy, and discovering the sacred mysteries to Miltiades. The Pythian answered, that Timo was not the adviser; but that the gods, having resolved to destroy Miltiades, had only made her the instrument of his death. After the battle of Salamis, Themistocles subjected Paros and most of the other neighbouring islands to Athens, exacting large sums from them by way of punishment for having favoured the Persians. It appears from the famous monument of Adulas, which Cosmos of Egypt has described with great exactness, that Paros and the other Cyclades were once subject to the Ptolemies of Egypt. However, Paros fell again under the power of the Athenians, who continued masters of it till they were driven out by Mithridates.\n\n(A) Sutherland says, \"that while its marble quarries continued to be worked, Paros was one of the most flourishing of the Cyclades; but on the decline of the eastern empire they were entirely neglected, and are now converted into caves, in which the shepherds shelter their flocks. We have been in several of these subterraneous folds, which put me much in mind of Homer's description of Polyphemus. The common walls are almost entirely composed of marble; and in examining a very small part of one, we found several pieces of cornice and balustrade. Several fine blocks of marble (fragments of columns) are lying close to the water's edge; and seem to have been brought there by travellers, who for want of a proper purchase to get them on board, have not been able to carry them further.\"\nthridates the Great. But that prince being obliged to yield to Sylla, to Lucullas, and to Pompey, this and the other islands of the Archipelago submitted to the Romans, who reduced them to a province with Lydia, Phrygia, and Caria.\n\nMr Sutherland, who lately visited Paros, says, that \"the water in it is excellent; and as that which we got at Melina has been complained of, as being too hard to make proper pease soup for the people, all the casks are ordered to be emptied and refilled.\" The Russians made this place their grand arsenal; their powder magazines, and several other buildings, are still standing; and the island is considerably indebted to them for improving the convenience for water, and for the trade which the cash they expended introduced among the inhabitants.\"\n\nPAROTIDES, or PAROTIDS, are glands situated on each side of the head. See ANATOMY Index.\n\nPAROXYSM, in Medicine, the feverish fit of a disease, under which it grows higher or exasperated; as of the gout, &c.\n\nPARR, CATHARINE, queen of England, was the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Parr of Kendall. She was first married to John Nevil, Lord Latimer; after whose death, by her marriage with Henry VIII, she was raised to the throne. The royal matriarchs were solemnized at Hampton Court on the 12th of July 1543. Being religiously disposed, she was, in the early part of her life, a zealous observer of the Roman rites and ceremonies; but in the dawning of the Reformation, she became as zealous a promoter of the Lutheran doctrine; yet with such prudence and circumspection as her perilous situation required. Nevertheless, we are told, that she was in great danger of falling a sacrifice to the Popish faction, the chief of whom was Bishop Gardiner; he drew up articles against her, and prevailed on the king to sign a warrant to remove her to the Tower. This warrant was, however, accidentally dropped, and immediately conveyed to her majesty. What her apprehensions must have been on this occasion may be easily imagined. She knew the monarch, and she could not help reflecting the fate of his former queens. A sudden illness was the natural consequence. The news of her indisposition brought the king to her apartment. He was lavish in expressions of affection, and sent her a physician. His majesty being soon after also somewhat indisposed, she prudently returned the visit; with which the king seemed pleased, and began to talk with her on religious subjects, proposing certain questions, concerning which he wanted her opinion. She answered, that such profound speculations were not suited to her sex; that it belonged to the husband to choose principles for his wife; the wife's duty was, in all cases, to adopt implicitly the sentiments of her husband; and as to herself, it was doubly her duty, being blest with a husband who was qualified, by his judgement and learning, not only to choose principles for his own family, but for the most wise and knowing of every nation. \"Not so, by St Mary,\" replied the king; \"you are now become a doctor, Kate, and better fitted to give than receive instruction.\" She meekly replied, that she was sensible how little she was entitled to these praises; that though she usually declined not any conversation, however futile, when proposed by his majesty, she well knew that her conceptions could serve no other purpose than to give him a little momentary amusement; that she found the conversation a little apt to languish when not revived by some opposition, and she had ventured sometimes to feign a contrariety of sentiments, in order to give him the pleasure of refuting her; and that she also proposed, by this innocent artifice, to engage him into topics whence she had observed, by frequent experience, that she reaped profit and instruction. \"And is it so, sweetheart?\" replied the king; \"then we are perfect friends again.\" He embraced her with great affection, and sent her away with assurances of his protection and kindness.\n\nThe time being now come when she was to be sent to the Tower, the king, walking in the garden, sent for the queen, and met her with great good humour; when lo the chancellor, with forty of the guards, approached. He fell upon his knees, and spoke softly with the king, who called him knave, arrant knave, beast, fool, and commanded him instantly to depart. Henry then returned to the queen, who ventured to intercede for the chancellor: \"Ah, poor soul,\" said the king, \"thou little knowest how evil he deserveth this grace at thy hands. Of my word, sweetheart, he hath been toward thee an arrant knave; and fo let him go.\" The king died in January 1547, just three years and a half after his marriage with this second Catharine: who in a short time was again espoused to Sir Thomas Seymour, lord-admiral of England; for in September 1548 she died in childbirth. The historians of this period generally infirmate that she was poisoned by her husband, to make way for his marriage with the lady Elizabeth.\n\nThat Catharine Parr was beautiful is beyond a doubt: that she was pious and learned is evident from her writings: and that her prudence and sagacity were not inferior to her other accomplishments, may be concluded from her holding up the passion of a capricious tyrant as a shield against her enemies; and that at the latter end of his days, when his passions were enfeebled by age, and his peevish austerity increased by disease.

He was the son of John Parr, a husbandman of Winnington, in the parish of Alderbury, in the county of Salop, where he was born in the year 1483. Though he lived to the vast age of upwards of 132 years, yet the tenor of his life admitted but of little variety; nor can the detail of it be considered of importance, further than what will arise from the gratification of that curiosity which naturally inquires after the mode of living which could lengthen life to such extreme.\nextreme old age. Following the profession of his father, he laboured hard, and lived on coarse fare. Taylor the water poet says of him:\n\nGood wholesome labour was his exercise,\nDown with the lamb, and with the lark would rise;\nIn mire and toiling sweat he spent the day,\nAnd to his team he whilied time away:\nThe cock his night-clock, and till day was done,\nHis watch and chief sun-dial was the sun.\nHe was of old Pythagoras' opinion,\nThat green cheese was most wholesome with an onion;\nCoarse neffin bread, and for his daily swig,\nMilk, butter milk, and water, whey and whig:\nSometimes metheglin, and by fortune happy,\nHe sometimes fipp'd a cup of ale most nappy;\nCyder or perry, when he did repair\n'To a Whitfriars' wake, wedding, or a fair,\nOr when in Christmas time he was a guest\nAt his good landlord's house amongst the rest:\nElse he had little leisure time to waffle,\nOr at the alehouse huff-cap ale to tattle.\nNor did he ever hunt a tavern fox;\nNe'er knew a coach, tobacco, or the ——.\nHis physic was good butter, which the foil\nOf Salop yields, more sweet than Candy oil;\nAnd garlic he esteem'd above the rate\nOf Venice treacle, or bell mitrhideate.\nHe entertain'd no gout, no ache he felt,\nThe air was good and temperate where he dwelt;\nWhile masques and sweet-tongu'd nightingales\nDid chant him roundelayes and madrigals.\nThus living within bounds of Nature's laws,\nOf his long lasting life may be some cause.\n\nAnd the same writer describes him in the following two lines:\n\nFrom head to heel, his body had all over\nA quick fet, thick fet, natural hairy cover.\n\nThe manner of his being conducted to London is also noticed in the following terms: \"The right honourable Thomas earl of Arundel and Surrey, earl marshal of England, on being lately in Shropshire to visit some lands and manors which his lordship holds in that county, or for some other occasions of importance which caused his lordship to be there, the report of this aged man was signified to his honour, who hearing of so remarkable a piece of antiquity, his lordship was pleased to see him; and in his innate, noble, and Christian piety, he took him into his charitable tuition and protection, commanding that a litter and two horses (for the more easy carriage of a man so feeble and worn with age) to be provided for him; also, that a daughter of his, named Lucy, should likewise attend him, and have a horse for her own riding with him: and to cheer up the old man, and make him merry, there was an antique-faced fellow, with a high and mighty no-beard, that had also a horse for his carriage. These were all to be brought out of the country to London by easy journeys, the charge being allowed by his lordship; likewise one of his lordship's own servants, named Bryan Kelly, to ride on horseback with them, and to attend and defray all manner of reckonings and expenses. All which was done accordingly as follows:\n\n\"Winnington is a parish of Alderbury, near a place called the Welch Pool, eight miles from Shrewsbury; from whence he was carried to Wen, a town of the earl's aforefaid; and the next day to Shifnal, a manor-house of his lordship's, where they likewise stayed one night: from Shifnal they came to Wolverhampton, and the next day to Birmingham, and from thence to Coventry. Although Master Kelly had much to do to keep the people off, that pressed upon him in all places where he came, yet at Coventry he was most opprested, for they came in such multitudes to see the old man, that those that defended him were almost quite tired and spent, and the aged man in danger of being stifled; and, in a word, the rabble were so unruly, that Bryan was in doubt he should bring his charge no farther; so greedy are the vulgar to hearken to or gaze after novelties. The trouble being over, the next day they passed to Daintree, to Stone Stratford, to Radburne, and so to London; where he was well entertained and accommodated with all things, having all the aforefaid attendance at the sole charge and cost of his lordship.\" When brought before the king, his majesty, with more acuteness than good manners, said to him, \"You have lived longer than other men, what have you done more than other men?\" He answered, \"I did penance when I was a hundred years o'd.\" This journey, however, proved fatal to him; owing to the alteration in his diet, to the change of the air, and his general mode of life, he lived but a very short time, dying the 5th of November 1635 (A); and was buried in Westminster Abbey. After his death, his body was opened; and an account was drawn up by the celebrated Dr Harvey, part of which we shall lay before our readers.\n\n\"Thomas Par was a poor country man of Shropshire, whence he was brought up to London by the right honourable Thomas earl of Arundel and Surrey; and died after he had outlived nine princes, in the tenth year of the tenth of them, at the age of 152 years and nine months.\n\n\"He had a large breast, lumps not fungous, but sticking to his ribs, and distended with blood; a liveliness in his face, as he had a difficulty of breathing a little before his death, and a long lasting warmth in his armpits and breast after it; which sign, together with others, were so evident in his body, as they use to be on those that die by suffocation. His heart was great, thick, fibrous, and fat. The blood in the heart blackish and diluted. The cartilages of the sternum not more bony than in others, but flexible and soft. His visceræ were found and strong, especially the stomach; and it was observed of him, that he used to eat often by night and day, though contented with old\n\n(A) The author of a book entitled Long Lives, 8vo. 1722, which Oldys in his MS. notes on Fuller ascribes to one Robert Samber, again all evidence says, p. 89, that Par died fifteen years after he had been presented to the king, 24th of November 1651.\nold cheese, milk, coarse bread, small beer, and whey; and, which is more remarkable, that he ate at midnight a little before he died. His kidneys were covered with fat, and pretty sound; only on the interior surface of them were found some aqueous or furred abscesses, whereof one was near the bigness of a hen's egg, with a yellowish water in it, having made a roundish cavity, impressed on that kidney; whence some thought it came that a little before his death a suppression of urine had befallen him; though others were of opinion, that his urine was suppressed upon the resignation of all the fertility into his lungs. Not the least appearance there was of any story matter either in the kidneys or bladder. His bowels were also found, a little whitish without. His spleen very little, hardly equalling the bigness of one kidney. In short, all his inward parts appeared so healthy, that if he had not changed his diet and air, he might perhaps have lived a good while longer. The cause of his death was imputed chiefly to the change of food and air; forasmuch as coming out of a clear, thin, and free air, he came into the thick air of London; and after a constant plain and homely country diet, he was taken into a splendid family, where he fed high and drank plentifully of the best wines, whereupon the natural functions of the parts of his body were overcharged, his lungs obstructed, and the habit of the whole body quite disordered; upon which there could not but ensue a dissolution. His brain was found, entire, and firm; and though he had not the use of his eyes, nor much of his memory, several years before he died, yet he had his hearing and apprehension very well; and was able, even to the 130th year of his age, to do any husbandman's work, even thrashing of corn.\n\nThe following summary of his life is copied from Oldys's MS. notes on Fuller's Worthies: Old Parr was born 1483; lived at home until 1500, at 17, when he went out to service. 1518, at 35, returned home from his master. 1522, at 39, spent four years on the remainder of his father's leave. 1543, at 62, ended the first leave he renewed of Mr Lewis Porter. 1563, at 80, married Jane, daughter of John Taylor, a maiden; by whom he had a son and a daughter, who both died very young. 1564, at 81, ended the second leave which he renewed of Mr John Porter. 1585, at 102, ended the third leave he had renewed of Mr Hugh Porter. 1588, at 105, did penance in Alderbury church, for lying with Katharine Milton, and getting her with child. 1595, at 112, he buried his wife Jane, after they had lived 32 years together. 1605, at 122, having lived 10 years a widower, he married Jane, widow of Anthony Adda, daughter of John Lloyd of Gilfells, in Montgomeryshire, who survived him. 1635, at 152, he died; after they had lived together 30 years, and after 50 years possession of his last leave.

He was one of the best painters in his time. Pliny says, that it was he who first gave symmetry and just proportions in that art; that he was likewise the first who knew how to express the truth and life of characters, and the different airs of the face; that he discovered a beautiful disposition of the hair, and heightened the grace of the village. It is allowed even by the masters in the art, that he far outshone them in the glory of succeeding in the outlines, in which consists the grand secret of painting. But it is also remarked by Pliny, that Parrhasius became infatigable with pride; and was so very vain as to give himself the most flattering epithets; such as, the tenderest, the softest, the greatest, the most delicate, and the perfectest of his art. He boasted that he was sprung from Apollo, and that he was born to paint the gods; that he had actually drawn Hercules touch by touch; that hero having often appeared to him in dreams. When the plurality of voices was against him at Samos in favour of Timanthes, in the opinion of a picture of Ajax provoked against the Greeks, for adjudging to Ulysses the arms of Achilles, he answered a person who condoled him on his check, \"For my part I don't trouble myself at the sentence; but I am sorry that the son of Telamon, hath received a greater outrage than that which was formerly put upon him so unjustly.\" Aelian relates this story, and tells us that Parrhasius affected to wear a crown of gold upon his head, and to carry in his hand a baton, ruddled with nails of the same metal. He worked at his art with plesantry, often indeed fingering. He was very licentious and loose in his pictures; and he is said, by way of amusement, to have represented the most infamous objects. His Atalantis, with her spouse Meleager, was of this kind. This piece was afterwards devised as a legacy to the emperor Tiberius, upon condition that, if he was displeased with the subject, he should receive a million sesterces instead of it. The emperor, covetous as he was, not only preferred the picture to that sum, but even placed it in his most favourite apartment. It is also said, that, though Parrhasius was excelled by Timanthes, yet he excelled Zeuxis. Among his pictures is a celebrated one of Theseus; and another representing Meleager, Hercules, and Perseus in a group together; as also Æneas, with Caïstor and Pollux, in a third.\n\nPARRHASIUS, Janus, a famous grammarian in Italy, who was born at Cofenza in the kingdom of Naples, 1470. He was intended for the law, the profession of his ancestors; but he refused it, and cultivated classical learning.

He taught at Milan with much reputation, being admired for a grace-\nPARRHESIA. See ORATORY, No. 88.\n\nPARRICIDE, the murder of one's parents or children. By the Roman law, it was punished in a much severer manner than any other kind of homicide. After being scourged, the delinquents were sewed up in a leathern sack, with a live dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and so cast into the sea. Solon, it is true, in his laws, made none against parricide; apprehending it impossible that one should be guilty of so unnatural a barbarity. And the Persians, according to Herodotus, entertained the same notion, when they adjudged all persons who killed their reputed parents to be bastards. And upon some such reason as this must we account for the omission of an exemplary punishment for this crime in our English laws; which treat it no otherwise than as simple murder, unless the child was also the servant of the parent.\n\nFor though the breach of natural relation is unobserved, yet the breach of civil or ecclesiastic connexions, when coupled with murder, denominates it a new offence; no less than a species of treason, called parva praeditio, or petit treason; which, however, is nothing else but an aggravated degree of murder; although, on account of the violation of private allegiance, it is stigmatized as an inferior species of treason. And thus, in the ancient Gothic constitution, we find the breach both of natural and civil relations ranked in the same class with crimes against the state and sovereign.\n\nPARROT.

See APIUM, Botany Index.\n\nPARSNIP. See Pastinaca, Botany Index.\n\nPARSON and VICAR. A parson, persona ecclesiae, is one that hath full possession of all the rights of a parochial church. He is called parson, persona, because by his person the church, which is an invisible body, is represented; and he is in himself a body corporate, in order to protect and defend the rights of the church (which he personates) by a perpetual succession. He is sometimes called the rector or governor of the church; but the appellation of parson, however it may be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use, is the most legal, most beneficial, and most honourable title that a parish priest can enjoy; because such a one (Sir Edward Coke observes), and he only, is said vicem seu personam ecclesiae gerere. A parson has, during his life, the freehold in himself of the parsonage house, the glebe, the tithes, and other dues. But these are sometimes appropriated; that is to say, the benefice is perpetually annexed to some spiritual corporation, either sole or aggregate, being the patron of the living; whom the law esteemeth equally capable of providing for the service of the church as any single private clergyman.\n\nThe appropriating corporations, or religious houses, were wont to depute one of their own body to perform divine service, and administer the sacraments, in those parishes of which the society was thus the parson. This officiating minister was in reality no more than a curate, deputy, or vicegerent of the appropriator, and therefore called vicarius, or \"vicar.\" His stipend was at the discretion of the appropriator, who was, however, bound of common right to find somebody, qui illi de temporalibus, episcopo de spiritualibus, debat respondere. But this\nthis was done in so scandalous a manner, and the parishioners suffered so much by the neglect of the appropriators, that the legislature was forced to interpose; and accordingly it is enacted, by statute 15 Rich. II. c. 6, that in all appropriations of churches the dean bishop shall ordain (in proportion to the value of the church) a competent sum to be distributed among the poor parishioners annually; and that the vicarage shall be sufficiently endowed. It seems the parish were frequently sufferers, not only by the want of divine service, but also by withholding those alms for which, among other purposes, the payment of tithes was originally imposed; and therefore in this act a pension is directed to be distributed among the poor parishioners, as well as a sufficient stipend to the vicar. But he, being liable to be removed at the pleasure of the appropriator, was not likely to insist too rigidly on the legal sufficiency of the stipend; and therefore, by statute 4 Hen. IV. c. 12, it is ordained, that the vicar shall be a secular person, not a member of any religious house; that he shall be vicar perpetual, not removable at the caprice of the monastery; and that he should be canonically instituted and inducted, and be sufficiently endowed, at the discretion of the ordinary; for these three express purposes, to do divine service, to inform the people, and to keep hospitality. The endowments, in consequence of these statutes, have usually been by a portion of the glebe or land belonging to the parsonage, and a particular share of the tithes, which the appropriators found it most troublesome to collect, and which are therefore generally called petty or small tithes; the greater, or predial tithes, being still referred to their own use. But one and the same rule was not observed in the endowment of all vicarages. Hence some are more liberally, and some more scantily, endowed; and hence the tithes of many things, as wood in particular, are in some parishes rectorial, and in some vicarial tithes.\n\nThe distinction therefore of a parson and vicar is this: The parson has for the most part the whole right to all the ecclesiastical dues in his parish; but a vicar has generally an appropriator over him, entitled to the best part of the profits, to whom he is in effect perpetual curate, with a standing salary. Though in some places the vicarage has been considerably augmented by a large share of the great tithes; which augmentations were greatly assisted by the statute 27 Car. II. c. 8, enacted in favour of poor vicars and curates, which rendered such temporary augmentations (when made by the appropriators) perpetual.\n\nThe method of becoming a parson or vicar is much the same. To both there are four requisites necessary; holy orders, presentation, institution, and induction. The method of conferring the holy orders of deacon and priest, according to the liturgy and canons, is so regal to the present purpose; any farther than as they are necessary requisites to make a complete parson or vicar. By common law, a deacon, of any age, might be instituted and inducted to a parsonage or vicarage; but it was ordained, by statute 13 Eliz. c. 12, that no person under twenty-three years of age, and in deacon's orders, should be presented to any benefice with cure; and if he were not ordained-priest within one year after his induction, he should be ipso facto deprived; and now, by statute 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4, no person is capable to be admitted to any benefice, unless he hath been first ordained a priest; and then he is, in the language of the law, a clerk in orders. But if he obtains orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices, (which seems to be the true, though not the common, notion of simony), the person giving such orders forfeits 40l. and the person receiving, 10l. and is incapable of any ecclesiastical preferment for seven years after.\n\nAny clerk may be presented to a parsonage or vicarage; that is, the patron, to whom the advowson of the church belongs, may offer his clerk to the bishop of the diocese to be instituted. But when he is presented, the bishop may refuse him upon many accounts. As, 1. If the patron is excommunicated, and remains in contempt 40 days; or, 2. If the clerk be unfit: which unfitness is of several kinds. First, With regard to his person; as if he be a bastard, an outlaw, an excommunicate, an alien, under age, or the like. Next, With regard to his faith or morals: as for any particular heresy, or vice that is malum in se; but if the bishop alleges only in generals, as that he is schismatics inveteratus, or objects a fault that is malum prohibitum merely, as haunting taverns, playing at unlawful games, or the like, it is not good cause of refusal. Or, lastly, The clerk may be unfit to discharge the pastoral office for want of learning. In any of which cases, the bishop may refuse the clerk. In case the refusal is for heresy, schism, inability of learning, or other matter of ecclesiastical cognizance, there the bishop must give notice to the patron of such his cause of refusal, who being usually a layman, is not supposed to have knowledge of it; else he cannot protest by lapse; but if the cause be temporal, there he is not bound to give notice.\n\nIf an action at law be brought by the patron against the bishop for refusing his clerk, the bishop must assign the cause. If the cause be of a temporal nature, and the fact admitted, (as, for instance, outlawry,) the judges of the king's courts must determine its validity, or whether it be sufficient cause of refusal: but if the fact be denied, it must be determined by a jury. If the cause be of a spiritual nature, (as heresy, particularly alleged,) the fact, if denied, shall also be determined by a jury: and if the fact be admitted or found, the court, upon consultation and advice of learned divines, shall decide its sufficiency. If the cause be want of learning, the bishop need not specify in what points the clerk is deficient, but only allege that he is deficient; for the statute 9 Edw. II. ft. i. c. 13, is express, that the examination of the fitness of a person presented to a benefice belongs to the ecclesiastical judge. But because it would be nugatory in this case to demand the reason of refusal from the ordinary, if the patron were bound to abide by his determination, who has already pronounced his clerk unfit; therefore if the bishop return the clerk to be minus sufficient in literatura, the court shall write to the metropolitan to re-examine him, and certify his qualifications; which certificate of the archbishop is final.\n\nIf the bishop hath no objections, but admits the patron's presentation, the clerk so admitted is next to be instituted by him; which is a kind of investiture of the spiritual part of the benefice; for by institution, the care of the souls of the parish is committed to the charge of the clerk. When a vicar is instituted, he (besides the usual\nusual forms) takes, if required by the bishop, an oath of perpetual residence; for the maxim of law is, that vicarius non habet vicarium: and as the non-residence of the appropriator was the cause of the perpetual establishment of vicarages, the law judges it very improper for them to defeat the end of their constitution, and by absence to create the very mischief which they were appointed to remedy; especially as, if any profits are to arise from putting in a curate and living at a distance from the parish, the appropriator, who is the real patron, has undoubtedly the elder title to them. When the ordinary is also the patron, and confers the living, the presentation and institution are one and the same act, and are called a collation to a benefice. By institution or collation the church is full, so that there can be no free presentation till another vacancy, at least in the case of a common patron; but the church is not full against the king till induction: nay, even if a clerk is instituted upon the king's presentation, the crown may revoke it before induction and present another clerk. Upon induction also the clerk may enter on the parsonage house and glebe, and take the tithes: but he cannot grant or let them, or bring an action for them, till induction.\n\nFor the rights of a parson or vicar, in his tithes and ecclesiastical dues, see TITHES. As to his duties, they are so numerous, that it is impracticable to recite them here with any tolerable conciseness or accuracy; but the reader who has occasion may consult Bishop Gibson's Codex, Johnson's Clergyman's Vade Mecum, and Barn's Ecclesiastical Law. We shall therefore only just mention the article of residence, upon the supposition of which the law doth make every parochial minister an incumbent. By statute 21 Hen. VIII. c. 13., persons willingly absenting themselves from their benefices, for one month together, or two months in the year, incur a penalty of £1. to the king, and £1. to any person that will sue for the same; except chaplains to the king, or others therein mentioned, during their attendance in the household of such as retain them; and also except all heads of houses, magistrates, and professors in the universities, and all students under forty years of age residing there, bona fide, for study. Legal residence is not only in the parish, but also in the parsonage house; for it hath been resolved, that the statute intended residence, not only for leaving the care and for hospitality, but also for maintaining the house, that the successor also may keep hospitality there.\n\nWe have seen that there is but one way whereby one may become a parson or vicar: there are many ways by which one may cease to be so. 1. By death. 2. By cession, in taking another benefice; for by statute 21 Hen. VIII. c. 13., if any one having a benefice of £1. per annum, or upwards, in the king's books, (according to the present valuation), accepts any other, the first shall be adjudged void, unless he obtains a dispensation; which no one is entitled to have but the chaplains of the king and others therein mentioned, the brethren and sons of lords and knights, and doctors and bachelors of divinity and law, admitted by the universities of this realm. And a vacancy thus made for want of a dispensation, is called cession. 3. By consecration; for, as was mentioned before, when a clerk is promoted to a bishopric, all his other preferments are void the instant that he is consecrated. But there is a method, by the favour of the crown, of holding such livings in commendam. Commenda, or ecclesia commendata, is a living commended by the crown to the care of a clerk, to hold till a proper parlor is provided for it. This may be temporary for one, two, or three years, or perpetual, being a kind of dispensation to avoid the vacancy of the living, and is called a commenda reiunere. There is also a commenda recipere, which is to take a benefice de novo, in the bishop's own gift, or the gift of some other patron consenting to the same; and this is the same to him as institution and induction are to another clerk. 4. By resignation. But this is of no avail till accepted by the ordinary, into whose hands the resignation must be made. 5. By deprivation, either by canonical censures, or in pursuance of divers penal statutes, which declare the benefice void, for some nonattendance or neglect, or else some malefeasance or crime: as for simony; for maintaining any doctrine in derogation of the king's supremacy, or of the thirty-nine articles, or of the book of common prayer; for neglecting after institution to read the liturgy and articles in the church, or make the declarations against Popery, or take the abjuration oath; for using any other form of prayer than the liturgy of the church of England; or for abstaining himself 60 days in one year from a benefice belonging to a Popish patron, to which the clerk was presented by either of the universities; in all which, and similar cases, the benefice is ipso facto void, without any formal sentence of deprivation.\n\nPARSONAGE, a rectory, or parish church, endowed with a glebe, house, lands, tithes, &c. for the maintenance of a minister, with cure of souls within such parish. See PARSON.\n\nPART, a portion of some whole, considered as divided or divisible.\n\nLogical PART, is a division for which we are indebted to the schoolmen. It refers to some universal as its whole; in which sense the species are parts of a genus, and individuals or singulars are parts of the species.\n\nPhysical PART, is that which, though it enter the composition of a whole, may yet be considered apart, and under its own distinct idea; in which sense, a continuum is said to consist of parts. Physical parts, again, are of two kinds, homogeneous and heterogeneous; the first are those of the same denomination with some other; the second of a different one: See HOMOGENEOUS, &c. Parts, again, are distinguished into subjective, essential, and integrant. The schoolmen were also the authors of this division.\n\nAliquot PART, is a quantity which, being repeated any number of times, becomes equal to an integer. Thus 6 is an aliquot part of 24, and 5 an aliquot part of 30, &c.\n\nAliquot PART, is a quantity, which, being repeated any number of times, becomes always either greater or less than the whole. Thus 5 is an aliquot part of 17, and 9 an aliquot part of 10, &c.\n\nThe aliquot part is resolvable into aliquot parts. Thus 15, an aliquot part of 20, is resolvable into 10, and 5 a fourth part of the same.\n\nPARTS of Speech, in Grammar, are all the sorts of words which can enter the composition of a discourse. See GRAMMAR.\n\nPARTERRE, in Gardening, a level division of ground,\nground, which for the most part faces the south, or best\nfront of a house, and is generally furnished with ever-\ngreens, flowers, &c. There are two kinds of these, the\nplain ones and the parterres of embroidery.\n\nPlain parterres are most valuable in England, because\nof the firmness of the English grass turf, which is supe-\nrior to that of any other part of the world; and the par-\nterres of embroidery are cut into shell and scroll work,\nwith alleys between them. An oblong, or long square,\nis accounted the most proper figure for a parterre; and\na parterre should indeed be always twice as long as it is\nbroad, because, according to the known laws of perspec-\ntive, a long square always looks to a square; and an\nexact square always appears less than it really is. As\nto the breadth of the parterre, it is to be proportionable\nto the breadth of the house; but less than 100 feet in\nbreadth is too little.\n\nThere should be on each side the parterre a terrace\nwalk raised for a view, and the flat of the parterre be-\ntween the terraces should never be more than 300 feet,\nat the utmost, in breadth; and about 140 feet in width,\nwith twice and a half that in length, is esteemed a very\ngood size and proportion.\n\nPARTHENIUM, a genus of plants, belonging to\nthe monocotyledon class, and in the natural method rank-\ning under the 49th order, Compositae.
