It is intended not merely to facilitate reference to the various Articles and Treatises, but to serve the far more important purpose of bringing into one view the varied and scattered information not indicated by respective heads or titles. This is rendered the more desirable, as the plan of the Encyclopædia includes so many general treatises and systems, embracing an immense number of subordinate and collateral topics to which the general title affords no clue. The names printed in capital letters indicate the subjects to which separate articles are assigned, and the first reference is to the volume and page where each article occurs. Immediately following this are the references to the same subject occurring throughout the entire Work, either of a general nature, or specifying the particular light in which it is regarded. These references are generally arranged according to their importance, or the fulness of information they afford; occasionally, however, it was thought expedient to follow the order of sequence in the volumes. The entries in the Index not distinguished by capital letters do not form separate articles, but indicate particular subjects occurring under other general heads; they include, for example, all the genera mentioned in the different articles on Natural History, English names of animals and plants, authors and books referred to, names of places, &c.\n\nIt was only in this way that the Index could be rendered an adequate representative of the contents of the Work; and while it necessarily gave to\nit a great degree of extension, it obviously affords valuable facilities for finding information on any particular subject. A reader, for instance, desirous of learning as much as possible about Scotland and Scottish affairs, will not only find, under the head Scotland, a general view of the history and statistics of the country, but be referred by the Index to many other parts of the Work (such as Britain, Fisheries, Roads, &c.), where a great variety of additional particulars are supplied. Again, as the Sciences are discussed in the Encyclopædia under their general names, the principal details embraced by them are given under such heads as, Anatomy, Chemistry, Entomology, Metaphysics, Meteorology, &c. By consulting the Index, therefore, the student will be saved the trouble of looking through a long treatise in search of information upon particular points; and those, again, who are in quest of information which they were not aware was to be found under such heads, may, in the same way, be enabled to extend their knowledge. The Indexes which follow certain articles (such as those on Natural History, &c.), are here incorporated under one continuous alphabetical arrangement.\n\nIt is necessary to observe, that, with the proper character of an Index, that of a Table of Contents is not here combined. For example, under the head Scotland in the Index, no reference is made to the contents of the article so headed in the Encyclopædia; it being presumed that a person making researches about Scotland will commence ascertaining its contents by turning over the pages of that article. But the Index points out other details referring to Scotland which occur under the various heads of Agriculture, Banks, Coal, Fisheries, Iron, Libraries, and so forth.\n\nWhen an article in the Index contains many references to countries and towns, the names of the latter are frequently arranged alphabetically, in the manner exemplified in Agriculture, Army, Education, &c. The adoption of this plan will save time and trouble to persons consulting the Index. The reference to maps is always given last; but it was thought unnecessary to refer to the plates generally, as the subjects of them are always sufficiently indicated in the articles which they are meant to illustrate.\nIn such a work as the Encyclopædia Britannica, a summary and digest of its contents like the present is more than usually necessary. Its extent has rendered the compilation a task of much labour. In such an immense number of references, most of them expressed in figures, it is scarcely to be expected that no inaccuracies will occur, but great care has been taken to avoid them, and to render the Index a faithful and complete representation and exponent of the contents of the entire Work. It must be obvious that, in a publication of such extent and variety of subjects, embracing, as it does, the whole field of human knowledge, everything calculated to give ready access to its stores of information, with increased ease of consultation, is of the utmost importance to the practical usefulness of the Work.\n\nJAMES DUNCAN.\n\nOld Manse, Denholm, April 1861.\n| A—ABA | ABA—ABB |\n|-------|---------|\n| A, the first letter of the alphabet, II. 1 —a famous word used as an abbreviation, IV. 25|\n| AA, several rivers as named, II. 2|\n| AACHEN, Cuyz-la-Chappelle, II. 9, 431|\n| adamant, Egyptian glass, IX. 268; X. 469; XLIV. 748; population, 746.|\n| —his works on bees, IX. 2.|\n| AALSTIN, town in Friesland, II. 3 — English name, II. 4, 12.|\n| AALSTIN, town in West Friesland, II. 5 —English name, II. 4.|\n\n| ABB—ABE |\n|---------|\n| ABBOTAFORD, residence of Sir Walter Scott, II. 16; XIX. 832, 833.|\n| Abbots-Langesley, village in Hyde Park, II. 1|\n| ABERRATION, II. 17—aberrations, III. 355, III. 367—in botany, V. 170—in arithmetic, III. 365, III. 367—characters, IV. 425—thoughts, VIII. 42|\n| See Stonography.|\n| ABODERNES, college in Rome, II. 21; X. 165|\n| Abemm, Steeple Hill, X. 21|\n| ABEDES, king of Scotland, X. 21|\n| ABADON, east end of Sliquidunach II. 9, 179|\n| Abadors, or Apparion, II. 12, 179; IV. 381|\n| ABDALLA, father of Mahomed, II. 179|\n| Abdallah, a Madaya fief, I. 202, I. 203|\n| ADELAIJAN, physician in traveller, II. 27, 279; XVIII. 209|\n| ADELAYDO IRVI, II. 22|\n| Ada chart, II. 33, 17|\n| Ada Conoly, II. 12, 179|\n| Adei Adi Aladros, II. 9, 179|\n| Apex eigen, in Sais, II. 7, 179|\n| Abd-el-Kader, X. 279, 221, 181 —in resistance to French aid Algiers, II. 202; his surrender to French, II. 202; accommodation at Mena, II. 202|\n| Abdel Aziz, X. 211|\n| Abdul Hamid, X. 211|\n| Abdel-latif, D.

During that period it has exhibited great and various changes. Consisting at first of three quarto volumes of moderate size, it now appears in twenty-one; each in quantity of matter equalling more than two of the original edition. Its internal changes have been still more remarkable. As it advanced, the whole circle of human knowledge came to be included within its ample limits. Showing, in its earlier stages, little literary skill above the level of respectable abridgment or compilation, it now includes treatises which may justly vie with the most finished productions of the age. The workmanship, at first, of a few among the least distinguished literary denizens of its native city, its list of contributors now embraces a large portion of that learned host by whom the sovereignty of literature is upheld. Thus, from being viewed as only a convenient digest of information, suited chiefly to the wants of the unlearned, it must now be considered as a large and well furnished repository of every variety of useful knowledge.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica has always differed materially, in its arrangement and object, from most works of the same class. It may therefore not be improper briefly to notice the rise and progress of this description of publications, and the principal improvements that were made on this work, before we give any account of the plan and progress of the Eighth edition, or of its superior claims to the patronage of the public.\nThis class of publications belongs entirely to the modern world; for though the Ancients had the term, they had no compilations resembling those to which the Moderns have applied it. The *Natural History* of Pliny has sometimes been styled an Encyclopædia; and he has himself said that it embraces all that the Greeks designated by the term. But this can only have reference to the compass and variety of its matter, not to arrangement or method; in which it has nothing in common with those collective digests which appeared in modern Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. If there were any anterior compilations of a similar nature, we need not look for them among the remains of Grecian or Roman literature, but among those of the learned Arabians of the middle ages. One such work, at least, exists in the collection of Arabic manuscripts preserved in the library of the Escurial. It is described in Casiri's account of them, as a work, \"Ubi scientiarum, artiumque liberalium, synopsis occurrit, una cum accurata et perspicua earum notitia, definitione, divisione, methodo;\"* and is said to have been compiled by Alfarabius, the great ornament of the School of Bagdad in the tenth century, who gave it the title of Encyclopædia.\n\nThe most noted and valuable of the early Encyclopædias was that of John Henry Alstedius, a Professor of Philosophy and Divinity at Weissembourg in Transylvania, and who is said to have been the author of about sixty other works, though he died at the age of fifty, in 1638.† His Encyclopædia, by which alone his name is remembered, appeared in 1630, in two folio volumes. A smaller and less comprehensive work of the same kind, which he published ten years before, served as the groundwork of this more extensive undertaking; in which he professedly aimed at the formation of a complete Encyclopædia.§ It consists of thirty-five books, of which the first four con-\n\n---\n\n* Casiri, Biblioth.

This work was held in high estimation till the close of the century in which it appeared. Leibnitz mentions it, in the early part of the next, in respectful terms; expressing, at the same time, an earnest wish that some of the learned would either join in remodelling and improving it, or in composing an entirely new work of the same kind.* The observations of this great philosopher show that he had reflected much on the objects of such an undertaking, and that he considered an Encyclopædia as a species of publication calculated to be eminently useful.\n\nAfter what has been said, it is scarcely necessary to observe, that, though the term Encyclopædia be now familiarized to us as an appellative for alphabetical digests of general knowledge, the first works so designated were not constructed with any reference to the alphabet. It was long before the idea occurred that the lexicographic plan might be used as the basis of an universal repertory of human learning; and still longer, before the alphabet was employed to introduce general treatises similar to those of the early Encyclopædias. Nearly a century elapsed from the publication of the popular work of Alstedius, before any considerable attempt was made to present the world with an encyclopedical dictionary; and for a long period thereafter, no dictionary of that description—none, in fact, till the appearance of the Encyclopædia Britannica—was enriched with complete or systematic views of the Sciences.\n\nDictionaries limited to the explanation of technical terms, and particular sciences, had been long common throughout Europe; but the first professed attempt to bring the whole body of science and art into the lexicographic form, was made in the Lexicon Technicum of Dr Harris. It was completed and\n\n* Leibnitii Opera, t. v. p. 405.\npublished at London in the year 1710;* and is generally viewed as the first great step in the advance to the more modern Encyclopædia. But, though professing to be universal, it was in fact limited almost entirely to mathematical and physical science; with respect to which, however, it has been generally allowed to have come fully up to the acquisitions of its day.\n\nThe Cyclopædia of Ephraim Chambers, published in 1728, presents the next marked advance in the composition of encyclopedical dictionaries; and may, indeed, be considered as constituting an era in the history of their formation. Till its appearance there had been no attempt to explain the sciences in the order of the alphabet, and at the same time to conjoin their component parts dissevered by that mode of arrangement. \"No one,\" says this author, \"seems to have perceived that a dictionary is in some measure capable of the advantages of a continued discourse; and, therefore, we see nothing like a whole in what has, in this sort, been done.\" It was not, however, by comprehensive views of the established divisions of knowledge, introduced in the alphabetical order of their names, that he proposed to remedy the evil of fractured \"wholes,\" of which he complains. He sought to accomplish this by references from general to particular heads, and from the latter to the former,—in short, from the parts of all connected subjects or topics, reciprocally, conformably to an illustrative scheme with which he furnished his readers. That something was thus done to indicate and conjoin the subordinate parts of a science, fortuitously scattered under the different heads of the alphabet, needs not be questioned; but the inherent defects of the plan were incapable of being surmounted by any system of references, however complete. The sciences cannot be taught or understood without being viewed continuously, in their natural state of unity and coherence; and the great and primary objects of an Encyclopædia cannot be attained, where that method of surveying them is not adopted. In other respects, too, Chambers's\n\n* In two folio volumes—the first in 1706, the other in 1710. It passed through five editions in the course of the next thirty years.\nnotions of what was required by the nature of his undertaking were confined and arbitrary; as in thinking that an Encyclopædia should only contain the conclusions, without any of the demonstrations of mathematical, or the experimental details of physical science. But, with all its defects, whether of plan or execution, his work must be allowed to be the production of a mind of no ordinary compass and vigour, as well as one of the most useful literary undertakings ever accomplished by a single hand. It did much through its numerous editions,* and the other works of the same kind to which it gave rise throughout Europe, to stimulate the curiosity, to enlarge the knowledge, and to diversify the intellectual pleasures and pursuits of the mass of mankind.\n\nThe popularity of the Cyclopædia remained undisturbed by any rival for a considerable period; but the success with which it was frequently republished, and the progress of knowledge in some departments in which it was from the first defective, by holding out a prospect of encouragement to newer undertakings, led at last to a succession of similar works, mostly modelled upon its plan. The title which Chambers chose, in preference to the more classical one of Encyclopædia, was however laid aside for that suggested by their alphabetical structure; nor was the correct name assumed conjunctively with the latter, in any British work of this class, till the appearance of the Encyclopædia Britannica.\n\nThe first of the works now referred to, Barrow's New and Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, consisting of a folio volume, was published in 1751; a supplement being added to it in 1754. Its only recommendations, as compared with its predecessor, consisted in an enlarged number of articles on mathematical subjects, on the mechanical arts, and on naval affairs; to make room for which church history and all scholastic topics were excluded. A garbled translation of D'Alembert's celebrated Preliminary Discourse to the French\n\n* The Cyclopædia consisted of two very large folio volumes, of which there were five editions published in the short period of eighteen years.\nEncyclopédie was prefixed, in two portions, to these two volumes, without the slightest notice being taken of the original.\n\nThis was followed, in 1754, by a New and Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, comprised in four large octavo volumes, written, according to the title-page, \"by a Society of Gentlemen.\" The general brevity of its articles enabled its compilers to widen its range in the departments of geography, commerce, and natural history. Prefixed to it there is a scheme of the divisions of human knowledge, intended to serve as the basis of its articles and references, and which is announced as \"more simple and natural, and likewise fuller and better distributed,\" than that of either Chambers or D'Alembert. It may, however, be fairly characterised as an exceedingly confused and illogical performance, exemplifying an arbitrary use of philosophical terms.\n\nIn 1766 was published, in three folio volumes, The Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled under the joint direction of the Rev. Henry Croker, Dr Thomas Williams, and Mr Samuel Clerk; the theological, philosophical, and critical departments being superintended by the first; those of anatomy, medicine, and chemistry, by the second; and the mathematical by the last. This division of labour does not appear to have contributed much to the excellence of the work, it being, with few exceptions, a sordid compilation. In point of method it has still less claim to praise. Its authors either did not perceive, or disregarded, the use of that chain of references by which Chambers endeavoured to remedy the defects arising from the division of naturally connected subjects under a multiplicity of separate heads. Part of D'Alembert's Discourse was here also appropriated without any mention of its paternity.\n\nOn the Continent, as well as in England, the Cyclopaedia of Chambers gave a new impulse to the desire for such publications. Within little more than twenty years from its first appearance, it had been translated into the Italian language; and became, in France, the foundation of the Encyclopédie,—the most extensive and celebrated undertaking of the kind that had yet\nappeared. This great work, originally intended to consist of ten, was ultimately enlarged to seventeen folio volumes, of which the first was published in 1751, the last in 1765.* It is well known to those conversant with its history, that it was founded upon an unpublished French translation of the work of Chambers. That translation was undertaken in 1743, and completed in 1745, by an Englishman of the name of Mills, assisted by a native of Dantzic, named Sellius.† It is not, perhaps, so generally known, that the Abbe de Gua was the projector of the Encyclopédie, and that it was only in consequence of a dispute between him and the publishers that the editorship was committed to D'Alembert and Diderot.‡\n\nSeeking no distinction, therefore, from novelty of method, they rested its claims to public favour upon the great extension of its several departments; upon the various attainments and literary eminence of its contributors; and, above all, on the philosophical spirit which animated their labours. It would be altogether foreign from our purpose to enter into any details concerning its philosophical or literary merits; or the irreligious and revolutionary designs with which its conductors were charged. But with respect to its completeness and consistency as a general repertory of knowledge, it may be observed that the popular branches of biography and history were excluded from its plan; and that, though it unquestionably contains many articles of great originality, depth, and ability, there is yet everywhere a large alloy of useless matter, dressed out in a vague, diffuse, and declamatory style.\n\n* Besides seventeen volumes of text, it has eleven of plates and descriptions, of which the first was published in 1762, the last in 1772.\n\n† Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau De Boisjermain, Souscripteur de l'Encyclopédie. 4to. Paris, 1771.\n\n‡ Nouv. Mem. de l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Berlin, pour l'an. 1770, p. 52. Biographie Universelle t. xviii. art. \"Gua de Malves.\" While both concur in bestowing the highest encomiums upon the encyclopedical method—or plan of references—which Chambers had exemplified, they represent his execution as that of a servile compiler, particularly from French writers; observing, that the design of publishing the translation of his work was abandoned because it was discovered that the public would thereby get little of which it was not already possessed in another form. They, at the same time, make the curious acknowledgment, that without the aids derived from that translation, it would have been next to impossible to procure the co-operation necessary to the composition of the Encyclopédie. \"Il n'y a presqu'aucun de nos Collègues, qu'on eût déterminé à travailler, si on lui eût proposé de composer à neuf toute sa partie; tous auraient été affrayés, et l'Encyclopédie ne se ferait point faite.\" Encyclopédie, art. \"Encyclop.\" tom. v. p. 645.\nTo its tendency to promote similar undertakings in the higher walks of literature, may probably be ascribed Goldsmith's proposal to publish \"A Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,\" with the promised assistance of the most distinguished British writers of that day; who, as Bishop Percy informs us, \"were to contribute articles, each on the subject in which he excelled.\"* The plan was frustrated by his untimely death; and it is matter of regret that his \"Prospectus,\" described by Percy as \"giving a luminous view of his design,\" has not hitherto reached the public.\n\nThe Encyclopædia Britannica made its first appearance a few years after the completion of its great French precursor, then at the height of its fame. The first edition, which was completed in the year 1771, though, as already observed, far from imposing or attractive either in respect of extent or execution, was yet distinguished by a more philosophical plan than had been adopted by any of its predecessors, either abroad or at home. Instead of attempting to elucidate the sciences by a number of separate articles corresponding to their technical titles or sections, introduced in the order prescribed by the alphabet—and with no continuity of explanation other than could be obtained through references from one head to another—it treated each science completely, in a systematic form, under its proper denomination; the technical terms and subordinate heads being also explained alphabetically, when anything more than a reference to the general treatise was required. This excellent method has been prosecuted upon a wider scale, and with more regularity of execution, in the subsequent editions; and though not always followed out with perfect order and consistency—for that could hardly be supposed possible in a work composed by so many different hands—it has nevertheless been practised to an extent that constitutes a great and beneficial improvement in the structure of Encyclopædias. Provision was thus made for the intermixture of general treatises, upon all subjects requiring continuous discussion, with a full statement of their subordinate heads or divisions. The objects aimed at in the early Encyclopædias were, in this way, reconciled to the lexico-\n\n* Life of Goldsmith, prefixed to Bishop Percy's edition of his work, vol. i. p. 112.\ngraphic plan, whilst its adaptation to particular topics was in no respect impaired. It has, indeed, been alleged that this method has a tendency to withdraw the attention from the inferior to the greater articles; and that the nobler provinces on the map of knowledge may thus appear in high culture and order, whilst the lower and obscurer districts and localities are found to bear the marks of desertion or neglect. But this is not by any means a necessary or unavoidable result. And the plan which is best adapted to a satisfactory delineation of the higher subjects of inquiry, and which promises most effectually to communicate a knowledge of them, may be considered as being, on the whole, that which has made the nearest approach to perfection, and is most likely to be productive of beneficial effects.\n\nThe Editor of the first edition of this Encyclopædia, Mr William Smellie, was a man of considerable intellectual resources, and particularly conversant with Natural History. His biographer says \"that the plan of the work was devised by him;\"* and if this alludes to its method in respect to the sciences, he was more likely to have suggested that great improvement than any of his coadjutors. That method, it may however be observed, was not entirely new. It had been partially exemplified many years before in Dr De Coetlogon's voluminous, but long forgotten \"Illustrations of the Arts and Sciences,\" published in 1745. In that work, each art and science was fully discussed in a separate treatise, introduced alphabetically under its name; thus exemplifying the distinguishing feature of the method in question. But whether it was suggested to Mr Smellie by that obscure publication does not appear.\n\nThe work, though bearing the title of Encyclopædia, was at first little more than a Dictionary of Arts and Sciences upon a greatly improved plan. But its second edition, completed in ten volumes, about twelve years after the first, was enriched by the addition of the great and popular branches—not treated in the same form in any preceding work of the kind—of Biography\n\n*Kerr's Life of Smellie, vol. i. p. 136.\nand History. In the French Encyclopédie, though occasional notices of memorable persons occur in the articles relative to the history of philosophy and science, there is no series of separate lives; and no place whatever is assigned to civil history. The supplement to that great work professed to include history in its plan; but its historical details being limited, for the most part, to what could be introduced under the names of kings and rulers, presented no substantive or connected views of nations and states. To include history, in any form, was considered by some critics, particularly by La Harpe, as an abuse of the purposes of an Encyclopædia. \"L'histoire n'est point,\" says he, \"une acquisition de l'esprit; ce n'est pas dans une Encyclopédie qu'on doit la chercher.\"* This is a manifestly arbitrary dictum, and would equally strike at many subjects of importance to the introduction of which La Harpe does not object. It derives no countenance either from the practice of the earlier encyclopaedists, or the opinions of the most enlightened of those who have commented upon their labours. Thus we find a general summary of the history of the world in the Encyclopædia of Alstedius; and Leibnitz, in remarking upon the defects of that work, mentions the historical department as one of those requiring to be greatly extended.†\n\nTill the publication of its third edition, which was completed in eighteen volumes, in 1797, its method and the comprehensiveness of its plan constituted the chief recommendations of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In none of its departments had it as yet attracted any marked approbation. But in this edition it rose greatly above its former level, both in its practical and speculative departments.\n\nThis edition was soon followed by two supplementary volumes, in which Professor Robison supplied the contributions wanting to complete that series which he had commenced when the principal work was far advanced. Taken\n\n* La Harpe, Cours de Littérature, t. xv. p. 74. † Leibnitii Opera, t. v. p. 184\ntogether, \"they exhibited,\" according to the late Dr Thomas Young, \"a more complete view of the modern improvements of Physical Science than had previously been in the possession of the British public.\"*\n\nA fourth edition, augmented to twenty volumes, was completed in 1810, under the able superintendence of the late Dr James Miller.† Most part of the new treatises which he introduced belonged, as was to be expected from his predilections and attainments, to Chemistry and Natural History—sciences then undergoing such rapid changes, that they added but little of permanent value to the work. The case, however, was different with Professor Wallace's mathematical contributions, which not only elevated its scientific character, but imparted to it considerable lasting utility.‡ The general value of the edition would have been much enhanced could its Editor have availed himself of those articles which Professor Robison contributed to the preceding supplemental volumes; but this was prevented by a temporary separation of the property from that of the principal work; and the incorporation of the whole—or rather of all that it was judged proper to republish—with the general text, was only effected in the seventh edition.§\n\nWith the completion of the fourth edition the progress of improvement was for some time suspended. The next two editions were little more than reprints of the former, and, therefore, contributed nothing to vary or advance the character of the work. But this was compensated for by the addition of a Supplement in six volumes.\n\nThis Supplement was projected by the late Mr Constable, soon after the principal work and its appendages had been purchased by his enterprising\n\n* See Dr Young's biographical account of Professor Robison in the present edition, vol. xix. p. 303.\n† See the notice of his Life in the present edition.\n‡ The following were the most valuable:—Algebra, Conic Sections, Fluxions, Geometry, Mensuration, Porisms, Series, Trigonometry.\n§ The following are the articles of the series reprinted in the seventh edition:—Arch, Carpentry, Centre, Dynamics, Perspective, Philosophy, Physics, Pumps, Resistance of Fluids, River, Roof, Seamanship, Signals, Steam-Engine, Strength of Materials, Telescope, Trumpet, Waterworks.\nhouse, then in the zenith of its prosperity. The first half-volume was prefaced by a discourse by Mr Dugald Stewart, being the first of those Preliminary Dissertations on the History of the Sciences, which, in their more complete state, have added so greatly to the value of the subsequent editions; and it was followed by a succession of treatises upon many of the most important branches of knowledge, written by men of the highest talents and reputation. Its fame was not confined to Britain, but extended to the Continent; and two of the most distinguished philosophers of France—M. Arago and M. Biot—were enrolled and took an active place amongst its scientific contributors. Its publication, which commenced in 1815, was completed in 1824.\n\nWithin a few years thereafter, the whole of these copyrights passed into the hands of the present proprietors: And this transfer of the property was soon followed by the announcement of preparations for the seventh edition, which was in every respect more perfect than any of the preceding editions.* In the Prospectus of their plan, the new proprietors stated, that \"the work would be widened in its compass, amplified and improved in its contents, and raised in all respects to a level with the modes of thinking and spirit of the age.\" And they believe it will be found that in most respects they fulfilled this rather comprehensive engagement.\n\nThe attention of the Editor was early directed to the completion of those Preliminary Dissertations on the History of the Sciences which had been published in the Supplement. They were intended to form two distinct Dissertations, each divided into Parts. The first was to contain the History of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy; the second, that of Mathematical and Physical Science. The one was undertaken by the late Dugald Stewart,—the other by his friend and colleague, the late Professor Playfair; and, incomplete as they were left at the death of these eminent men,\n\n* The seventh edition began to be published in monthly parts in March 1830, and was finished in January 1842.\nthey yet, to a considerable extent, supplied a great desideratum in British literature. The idea of a continuous delineation of the progress of the human mind in the discovery of truth and the correction of error, as an Introduction to a work in which the sciences are examined in detail, was, for the first time, exemplified in the Discourse prefixed by D'Alembert to the French Encyclopédie; and nothing of the kind, of acknowledged merit, had, in any shape, been given to the world in our own language prior to these Dissertations. That Discourse, though grand in its outline, was at once too rapid and too compressed in its notices of those \"great lights of the world, by whom the torch of science has been successively seized and transmitted,\" to impart to the student, or to fix in his recollection, any satisfactory views of their opinions and achievements. The Scottish Discourses were written upon a scale which enabled their authors to remedy that defect; and they accordingly present, in a style as eloquent as their subjects are dignified, instructive views of the advances and failures of human reason, and the progress of genuine science, combined with the justest estimates of those who have most affected that progress for good or for evil. Stewart had originally intended to trace the history of all the principal branches of philosophy connected with the knowledge of the Mind; but his plan was completed only in as far as regarded the fundamental or Metaphysical branch; the others—with the exception of some valuable observations occasionally introduced in the former, concerning the Ethical and Political notions of the sixteenth and early part of the seventeenth centuries—having been left untouched. Fortunately, however, the portion completed and published had received, before the death of the venerable author, a careful revision and some additions of moment from his own hand. The history of the Mathematical and Physical sciences, again, was, at Professor Playfair's death, brought down only to the period rendered memorable by the names of Newton and Leibnitz; thus leaving the discoveries of a century, eminently progressive in scientific knowledge, to be detailed by other hands. It was the wish of the Editor to procure such continuations as should complete the plan which the original masters had sketched out; and, in as far as concerns Mathematical and Physical science, this may be considered as having been in great measure accom-\nplished by the animated and instructive sequel to Professor Playfair's treatise, written by the successor to his academical chair, the late Sir John Leslie. To these has now been added a Dissertation by James David Forbes, the distinguished Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, now Principal of the University of St Andrews, bringing down the history of modern scientific progress to the year 1850. These Dissertations form an appropriate vestibule to the work; and although they may not present a complete history of ethics and science, and though differences of execution may, no doubt, be perceived among them, it cannot be denied that they furnish admirable illustrations of the progress of most of their principal branches.\n\nThe editorial care of the seventh edition was placed in the hands of the late Mr Macvey Napier, who held the Chair of Conveyancing in the University of Edinburgh from 1825 until his death in 1847; and it is but due to the memory of that gentleman to say, that he discharged the duties of his trying position with zeal and success. He was assisted in the greater part of the work by Dr James Browne, a gentleman of talent and learning, who not only aided him in superintending the volumes as they passed through the press, but contributed numerous articles, conspicuous for their ingenuity and ability, on various subjects of literary and scientific interest.\n\nIn his account of the present [eighth] edition, the Editor is necessarily obliged to restrict himself to a brevity of statement which excludes the possibility of mentioning all the valuable treatises that have been transferred to it from the preceding editions and their Supplements.\n\nIt may be stated generally, that every article of value in any preceding edition has been reprinted in this,—in all cases with corrections, and frequently with considerable additions. Besides these, it has received so great an accession of original contributions, that nine-tenths of its contents may be said to be absolutely new. The eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica was begun at the close of 1852, and completed at the end of 1860. Encouraged by the success which had attended the previous issues of the work (upwards of thirty thousand copies of it having been sold from its commencement), the publishers were emboldened again to undertake a new issue of the work. From the rapid progress made by every branch of science and literature, and from the high estimation in which the work had hitherto been held, a presumption was afforded that, if judiciously edited, the book would secure a full share of public patronage. The editorial charge was entrusted to Dr Thomas Stewart Traill, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in the University of Edinburgh. His acknowledged taste and eminence in most departments of learning and science, which the culture of a long life had greatly improved, pointed him out as being well qualified for the task. As long as his health was equal to the labour, the work had the advantage of his learning and ability, and his editorial care was happily continued till near its completion. From the beginning it was resolved that the revision and extension of the articles should be more thorough than had ever been attempted in any previous edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. This was rendered necessary by the advancement of knowledge, as well as by the increased demand for works of this class by the diffusion of education throughout the country.\n\nOn taking a review of the entire field of knowledge to be gone over by the encyclopaedist, and on carefully studying afresh all the methods, both of system and of detail, that have hitherto been proposed for such a work, it appeared that the arrangement hitherto followed in this Encyclopaedia was, all things considered, decidedly the best. This method consisted of a judicious combination of the systematic and the particular. It has in few instances been attempted to exhibit any science or department of knowledge according to the analytical and merely technical headings occurring in the order of the alphabet: but it has, on the contrary, so far as was judged advisable, been attempted to treat each science completely and at once, in a systematic form, and under its own proper designation, referring for particulars to its subordinate heads. All, therefore, will be suited, whether they wish to acquire a systematic or scientific\nview of any subject, or to obtain that precise information on special points that may satisfy the exigences of the moment.\n\nIn a work of such magnitude, and embodying all, or nearly all, the departments of science, art, and literature, it would be idle to attempt to specify and characterise the principal writers who have contributed to its pages, or to estimate their articles; and, supposing such attempt were made, it could not fail to be in many respects erroneous and defective as well as invidious. We, therefore, shall content ourselves with giving a list of the leading articles in the principal departments of the work, and of the authors by whom they have been contributed. The reader will have no difficulty, without any suggestion of ours, in appreciating the merits of each; and we believe that there are but few from which he will not derive sound information, expressed clearly and distinctly.\n\nThe subjoined list embraces the names of the greater number of the individuals most celebrated in scientific, literary and political history, who have adorned the annals of this country for a long series of years. They were all aware, when they contributed articles to this work, that their names would be given along with them, and the fair presumption is that they did their best to make them worthy of their celebrity. And we are pretty confident that those who look into the articles referred to will find that this presumption has been fully realized, and that, speaking generally, they are worthy alike of the authors and the subjects.\n\nI.

But a full enumeration is rendered less necessary, as a complete list of contributors accompanies this Preface. This list is arranged in the alphabetical order of the initials of the surnames—for example, J. S. B. will be found under Blackie, John Stuart. To render the literary history of the work as complete as possible, the Editor has also annexed Signatures to articles of eminence written for previous editions, wherever he was able to do so upon authoritative grounds. He is sorry to add, that in some copies, signatures, both to new articles and to some of the reprints, have been accidentally omitted; and that, in a few instances, they have been so misapplied as to give to one author what was written by another. The mistakes that might arise from these defects and inaccuracies will be partly obviated by the statements in this Preface; and the Editor ventures to hope that such errors as may still remain uncorrected, in the handicraft details of a work so extensive, will be acknowledged as almost unavoidable, even by those whom they may personally affect.\n\nIt would be ungracious to conclude this Preface without acknowledging the valuable services of the literary gentlemen to whom this edition is indebted, under the superintendence of the Editor, for the greater part of the articles without signatures, which are either original or revisions of former contributions. Of these, Mr Thomas Stewart Traill, the amiable son of the Editor, after four years of assiduous and much-prized services, was removed by death in early manhood. The others who may be mentioned, as comprising the regular staff of the Encyclopaedia, were—John Downes, A.M.; David Kay, F.R.G.S.; Alexander Nicolson, A.M., Advocate; James Carmichael, Classical Master, Edinburgh Academy; Rev. Richard Waterston, A.B.; Rev. Peter Macpherson; David Pryde, A.M.; James S. Candlish, A.M. These have all, according to their opportunity, given their aid, in many important ways, to the furtherance of the work.\nA few omissions in the text, for which the editor alone is to blame, were discovered too late to be remedied. And errors of various kinds may, no doubt, be also perceived, or may in time become obvious. It is not, in fact, possible to recollect and provide for everything that ought to be found in so multifarious a publication; and such blemishes as cannot fairly be ascribed either to remissness or indifference, the candid inquirer will readily excuse.\n\nThe predominance of Woodcuts over Engravings was rendered essential both from the desire of the writers, and from the demands of the public to have the text fully illustrated; and in this they have been used much more abundantly than in any previous edition. Both in number and in execution these representations speak sufficiently for themselves.\n\nThe eighth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica is the largest literary enterprise ever undertaken by any single house in Great Britain, involving an expense which, but for the liberal patronage of the public, would have been almost appalling. The Editor has to acknowledge that his efforts have been warmly seconded by the proprietors, who have grudged no outlay in order to render this great work as perfect as possible in every department.\n\nThis outline may be fitly closed by the mention of a distinguishing part of this and of the previous edition, and which, indeed, is altogether new in British Encyclopædias,—that is, an extensive General Index. Other portions of the work may be more extolled; yet this undeniably lays claim to a degree of utility, which must be more or less appreciated by every class of inquirers—as furnishing a key, not merely to this or that particular science or subject, but to everything included within the vast circuit of these volumes. It is indeed obvious, that if an Encyclopædia has in any tolerable degree realized its objects, an index to it must necessarily be a highly useful compilation; and it certainly, at first view, appears somewhat remarkable, that no such appendage to any work of this description should have appeared in this country previously to the publication of the last edition\nof the Britannica. It was thought, perhaps, that an Encyclopædia is itself a species of Index, and that the contents of each article are sufficiently disclosed by its title. But this is a mistake. Information upon particular topics may be, and often is, scattered under a number of different heads, or may lurk in corners where it might not be expected, or be readily found without its being pointed out—and hence an Index is indispensable to perfect an Encyclopædia. Much, however, of its value depends on the skill and care with which it has been compiled; and, in this case, these qualities have been united with a degree of intelligence and zeal seldom exemplified in a performance wholly unattended with literary distinction. The Index to the last edition was compiled by Mr Robert Cox, W.S.; and that now laid before the reader is the work of the Rev. James Duncan of Denholm, who will be thanked by all who avail themselves of the ready access he has thus afforded to the treasures of this multifarious Repository.\n\nEdinburgh, January 1861.\nNOTICE.\n\nThe Article on Wine, Vol. XXI., was in type before the passing of the Act 23 and 24 Vict. c. 110, \"to consolidate the Duties of Customs,\" which received the royal assent on the 28th August 1860. Hence the schedule of duties which appears at p. 891, being that which was embodied in the Commercial Treaty with France, ratified in the spring of the same year, differs somewhat from the rates as finally adjusted by Parliament. The following table exhibits the amounts as they came into force on the 1st January 1861:\n\nWine containing less than the following rates of proof Spirit, verified by Sykes' Hydrometer.\n\n| From and after 1st January 1861. | 18 Degrees. | 26 Degrees. | 40 Degrees. | 45 Degrees. |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Of or from Foreign Countries—     | £ s. d.    | £ s. d.    | £ s. d.    | £ s. d.    |\n| Red, (gallon)                    | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n| White,                           | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n| Lees,                            | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n\nThe growth and produce of a British Possession—\n\n| Red, (gallon)                    | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n| White,                           | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n| Lees,                            | 0 1 0       | 0 1 9       | 0 2 5       | 0 2 11      |\n\nWhen imported in bottles, and containing less than 40 degrees of strength, to be charged 2s. 5d. per gallon.\n## INDEX TO THE NAMES OF AUTHORS WHOSE INITIALS ARE AFFIXED TO CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\n| Initials | Names |\n|----------|-------|\n| W.H.D.A. | Adams, W.
