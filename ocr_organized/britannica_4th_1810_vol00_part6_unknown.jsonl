In April it was cross-ploughed and harrowed. On the 8th of May the field was marked out into beds or ridges eight feet wide, leaving a space of two feet wide for an alley between every two ridges. The manure (a compost of stable dung, virgin earth, and scrapings of a turnpike road) was then brought on the land, and deposited in small heaps on the centre of each ridge, in the proportion of about thirty cart-loads to each acre. A trench was then opened with a spade, breadth-way of the ridge, about four inches deep; in this trench the potato sets were placed, at the distance of nine inches from each other; the dung was then spread in a trench on the sets, and a space of split of 14 inches in breadth dug upon them. When the plants were about five inches high, they were carefully hoed, and soon after the two feet intervals between the ridges were dug, and the contents thrown around the young plants. This refreshment, added to the ample manuring previously bestowed, produced such a luxuriance and rapidity of growth, that no weed could show its head.\n\nThe shortest and most certain method of taking up potatoes, is to plough once round every row at the distance of four inches, removing the earth from the plants, and gathering up with the hand all the potatoes that appear. The distance is made four inches, to prevent cutting the roots, which are seldom found above that distance from the row on each side. When the ground is thus cleared by the plough, raise the potatoes with a fork having three broad toes or claws; which is better than a spade, as it does not cut the potatoes. The potatoes thus laid above ground must be gathered with the hand. By this method scarce a potato will be left.\n\nAs potatoes are a comfortable food for the common people, it is of importance to have them all the year round. For a long time, potatoes in Scotland were confined to the kitchen garden; and after they were planted in the field, it was not imagined at first that they could be used after the month of December. Of late years, they have been found to answer even till midsummer; which has proved a great support to many a poor family, as they are easily cooked, and require neither kiln nor mill. But there is no cause for stopping there. It is easy to preserve them till the next crop: When taken out of the ground, lay in the corner of a barn a quantity that may serve till April, covered from frost with dry straw pressed down: bury the remainder in a hole dug in dry ground, mixed with the hulls of dried oats, sand, or the dry leaves of trees, over which build a stack of hay or corn. When the pit is opened for taking out the potatoes, the eyes of what have a tendency to push must be cut out; and this cargo will serve all the month of June: To be still more certain of making the old crop meet the new, the setting of a small quantity may be delayed till June, to be taken up at the ordinary time before frost. This cargo, having not arrived to full growth, will not be so ready to push as what are set in April.\n\nIf the old crop happen to be exhausted before the new crop is ready, the interval may be supplied by the potatoes of the new crop that lie next the surface, to be picked up with the hand; which, far from hurting the crop, will rather improve it.\n\nIn the Transactions of the Society for the encouragement of Arts, a number of experiments are related by Mr Young on that kind called the cluttered or bog experiment potato, which he strongly recommends as food for the poor, in preference to the kidney or other more expensive kinds. The following is the result of the most remarkable of his experiments.\n\nIn the first week of March 1780, two acres and a quarter of barley stubble were sown with the cluttered potato, which appeared on the 23rd of May. A sharp frost on the 7th of June turned them as black as they usually are by the frosts of November and December. In time, however, they recovered; and by the end of October produced 876 bushels from the 2¼ acres; which, when cleaned, were reduced to 780, or 350 bushels per acre; thus affording, when valued only at 6d. per bushel, a clear profit of 71. 14s. 4d. per acre.\n\nThe experiment, however, in his opinion, would have been still more profitable, had it not been for the following circumstances: 1. The soil was not altogether proper. 2. The crop was grievously injured by the frost already mentioned, which, in our author's opinion, retarded the growth for about six weeks. 3. The dung was not of his own raising, but purchased; which cannot but be supposed to make a great difference, not only on account of the price, but likewise of the quality.\nCulture of lily, as happened to be the case at present. He is of opinion, however, that potatoes, at least this kind of them, are an exhausting crop. Having sown the field after this large crop of potatoes with wheat, his neighbours were of opinion that it would be too rank; but so far was this from being the case, that the wheat showed not the least sign of luxuriance, nor the least superiority over the parts adjacent which were sown without dung. He was willing to account for this by the poverty of the dung, and the severe cropping which the ground had undergone while in the possession of the former tenant. In another experiment, however, in which the ground had been likewise exhausted by severe cropping, the succeeding crop of wheat showed no luxuriance; so that the former supposition of the exhausting quality of the clutter potato was rather confirmed. The ground was a fine turnip loam; but though the produce was even greater than in the former case, viz. 356 bushels from an acre, the profit was much less, viz. only £1. 1s. 6d. An acre of ley ground was sown at the same time with the turnip loam, but the produce from it was only 200 bushels. Mr Young supposes that the produce would have been greater if the potatoes had been planted with an iron dibble, as the turf, in ploughing, lay too heavy upon the seed. A few rows of other potatoes, planted along with the cluttered kind, did not vegetate at all; which shows that the latter have a more powerful vegetative faculty.\n\nHaving succeeded so well with his experiments on this kind of potato hitherto, Mr Young determined to try the culture of them upon a larger scale; and therefore, in the year 1782, sowed 11 acres; but being obliged to commit the care of sowing them to an ignorant labourer, his unskilfulness, together with the excessive cold and moisture of that season, so diminished the produce, that he had only a single acre out of the whole. This produced 180 bushels, which yielded a clear profit £1. 2s. 6d. From this experiment he draws the following conclusions: 1. \"That the poor loam, on which these potatoes were sown, will yield a crop of clutter-potatoes, though not of any other kind. 2. That the manure for potatoes ought to be carted and spread upon all soils inclinable to wet before the planting season, either in autumn preceding, or else during a hard frost.\" In 1783 he succeeded still worse; for having that year sown three acres and a half, the profit did not exceed £1s. 4d. per acre. The produce was about 224 bushels per acre. He gives two reasons for the failure of this crop: 1. The cluttered potato thrives best in wet years; but the summer of 1783 was dry and hot. 2. The spring frosts, by interrupting the hoeing, not only greatly raised the expenses, but very much injured the crop by encouraging the growth of weeds. Barley was sown after the last crop, and produced well; so that our author thinks the potatoes seem to be a better preparation for spring corn than wheat. His experiment in 1784 produced a clear profit of £1. os. 4d.; the produce being 250 bushels per acre. Still, however, an error was committed, by employing an old man and woman to cut the sets, by whose unskilfulness there were many great gaps among the potatoes as they came up; so that, on the whole, he reckons that he thus lost from 500 to 800 bushels. On the whole, however, his opinion is favourable to the clutter potato. \"With small crops (says he), and at the low rate of value which is produced by confining them at home, they are clearly proved to be a crop which will pay the expense of manuring, and very ample tillage and hoeing. This is, after all, the chief object of modern husbandry; for if a man can rely upon this potato for the winter consumption for his yard in fattening or keeping hogs, in feeding his horses, and fattening his bullocks, he has made one of the greatest acquisitions that can be desired; since he can do all this upon land much too stiff and wet for turnips; housethis crops before the winter rains come on; and consequently without doing any of that injury to his land which the turnip culture is known to entail, and from which even cabbages are not free. Those who know the importance of winter food on a turnip farm, cannot but admit the magnitude of this object on wet soils.\"\n\nMr Marthall in his Rural Economy of Yorkshire, Mr Marthall has several very interesting remarks on the potato. Its shallowness, he says, are endless and transitory. The marks rough skinned Ruffia potato, which was long a favourite of the Yorkshire farmers, he is of opinion, has now no longer an existence, more than many others which flourished for a time. \"There is some reason to believe (says he) that the disease which has of late years curled been fatal to the potato crop in this and in other districts under the name of curled tops, has arisen from too long a continuance of declining varieties. Be this as it may, it appears to be an established opinion here, that fresh varieties, raised from seed, are not liable to that disease.\" Our author, however, does not look upon this to be a fact absolutely established: though one instance fell under his observation, in which its removal was in all probability owing to the introduction of new varieties. It made its appearance between 40 and 50 years ago, and spread in some degree over the whole kingdom. In some places it continued but a short time, so that its effects are almost forgotten. It is seldom obvious at the first coming up of the plants, but attacks them as they increase in size; the entire top becoming dwarfish and shrivelled as if affected by drought or loaded with insects; they nevertheless live and increase, though slowly, in size; but the roots are unproductive. Some crops have been almost wholly destroyed by this disease. In Yorkshire the Morelands are in a manner free from it, but the Vale is in some measure infected. Plants procured from the Morelands remain free from it in the Vale the first year; but, being continued, become liable to the disease. Where the attack has been partial, weeding out the diseased plants as they failed, is said to have had a good effect; and it is said the Morelanders got rid of the disease by this means.\n\nIn Yorkshire some intelligent husbandmen are acquainted with the method of raising potatoes from seed; which is as follows: \"In autumn, when the apples are beginning to fall spontaneously, they are gathered by hand, and preserved among sand until the spring, when they are mashed among the sand or among fresh mould; separating the seeds and mixing them evenly with the mould. As soon as the spring frosts are judged to be over, they are sown in fine garden mould; and as fast as the plants get into rough leaf, and are strong enough to be handled without injury, they...\"\nCulture of they are transplanted into another bed of rich mould particular in rows, which are kept clean during summer. In autumn, bunches of small potatoes are found at the roots of these plants; varying in size, the first year, from a hazel nut to that of a crab. These being planted next spring, produce potatoes of the middle size; but they do not arrive at their fullest bulk until the third or fourth year. Where the use of the stove or the garden frame can be had, this process may be shortened. The seeds being sown within either of these early in the spring, the plants will be fit to be planted out, as soon as the frosts are gone; by which means the size of the roots will be much increased the first year, and will in the second rise early to perfection.\"\n\nAnother account of the mode of raising potatoes from seed is given by Mr Henry Doby of Woodside Chapel, Allerton, near Leeds. \"Take the largest potatoes, of the kind you wish to renew, and string them on a very strong coarse thread, and hang them in a dry warm place till the latter end of February; when breaking them very small and washing them in several waters, the feed is to be separated from the fleshy part and skins; this done, it should be spread on brown paper; and when dry, sow it in the beginning of March, or sooner, on a hot-bed, in lines about nine inches asunder, and one-third of an inch deep, and very thin; water between the lines frequently, and when the plants are risen a little height, introduce fine rich earth between the lines to strengthen them. They should have air admitted frequently, the better to enable them to bear being removed into the open air as soon as the weather shall be sufficiently temperate. Before they are transplanted they should be plentifully watered to make them rise with a large ball at their roots; old rotten horse-dung and yellow muck are the best manures; plant them in trenches, as celery was formerly, with a space of four feet between the trenches, and 12 or 14 inches between each plant; as they grow up, draw the earth between the trenches to the stalks, but do not cover their tops. The ground, when brought to a level, should be dug, and the plants earthened until there are pretty deep trenches formed between the lines. With this treatment they will produce the first season from a pound weight to five pounds a plant; and many of the plants considerably more than a hundred potatoes a-piece; the produce of which for ten or twelve years after will be prodigious.\"\n\nIn the 4th volume of the Bath Papers, Dr Anderson relates some experiments made on potatoes raised from seed. The first year they were of different sizes, from a pigeon's egg to that of a small pea. On planting these next year, it was invariably found, that the largest potatoes yielded the largest crop; and the same happened the third, when a few showed blossom; but not even these had bulbs equal to what would have been produced by very large potatoes. Whence he concludes, that it is impossible to assign any time in which these feeding potatoes will arrive at what is called perfection; but that it must depend very much on the nature of the soil and the culture bestowed upon them. From the practice of the Yorkshire farmers, however, and even from the experiments of the Doctor himself, it is evident, that potatoes raised in this way will at last grow to the usual size, as during the three years in which his experiments were continued they constantly increased in bulk. Dr Anderson likewise contends, that there is no reason for supposing that potatoes raised from bulbs in the ordinary way degenerate, or require to be renewed by seminal varieties; and he instances the universal practice of potatoes in Britain and Ireland for a great number of years past.\n\nBut this may be accounted for from an observation of Mr Marshall's, that varieties of potatoes, like those of corn, are partial to particular soils and situations. Hence, by transplanting all the different varieties of potatoes into all possible soils and situations, as has been done within this last century in the islands of Britain and Ireland, these varieties have continued for a much longer time than they would otherwise have done. In Yorkshire, Mr Marshall tells us, that \"the old favourite sorts were driven until some of the individual plants barely produced their seed again.\" It is evident, therefore, that there is a necessity from time to time of renewing them from seed; though it deserves well to be considered whether it would not be more eligible to choose the seed from a plant in full vigour than from that which is so far degenerated that it can scarcely produce its seed. \"Potatoes raised from seed (says Mr Marshall) are a miscellany of endless varieties. Sometimes these varieties are planted miscellaneous; sometimes particular varieties are selected. In selecting varieties from seedling potatoes, two things are to be attended to; the intrinsic quality of the potato, and its productiveness. If these two desirable properties can be found in one plant, the choice is determined. To this species of attention and industry we are indebted for the many valuable kinds which have been and now are distributed throughout the island. It is observable, however, that varieties of potatoes, like those of corn, are partial to particular soils and situations. Hence the propriety of husbandmen raising potatoes from seed; as by this means they obtain, with a degree of moral certainty, a sort adapted to their own particular soils and situations. Whoever has attended closely to the work of taking up potatoes, must have observed the great inequality in the productiveness of individual plants. The difference in the produce of adjoining roots, where no disparity of soil can influence, will sometimes be three or four fold. Hence it is evident, that each variety has its sub-varieties; through whose means it can hardly be doubted the parent variety may be improved, and its continuance be prolonged. Thus the farmer has another mean in his power of improving the quality and productiveness of his potato crop, by improving varieties; or, in other words, selecting sub-varieties, superiorly adapted to his soil and situation.\"\n\nSir Archibald Grant, Bart. of Monymusk, in a Farmer's letter to the conductors of the Farmer's Magazine, has recently made known a mode practised by him with a view to the saving of seed, and the obtaining an early crop of potatoes. \"In spring 1800, (says that gentleman), from a scarcity of seed, I followed a method sometimes used by gardeners, for forcing early potatoes, by cropping peas, and beans, viz., that of planting them out upon a small dunghill, in order to make them come sooner forward, and afterwards transplanting them into the ground. This I did, after they had upon the dunghill risen to be good plants, and the leaves about an inch long.\nCulture of long. The dunghill was about three feet broad and 18 inches high, with from 2 to 3 inches of earth upon the top of it, and as long as held about a peck and three quarters of a peck of Aberdeenshire measure (or 32lb. Dutch to the peck) of small potatoes, cut into sets, stuck as close to each other as possible in the rows, and each row about two inches asunder. On the 17th of April, they were put upon the dunghill; on the 2d of May they were in leaf; and on the 14th and 16th of May were planted out into the field; each plant 3 feet asunder each way. On the 12th June, they were earthed up with the plough, and were afterwards drest in the ordinary method. On the 1st Monday of October, being taken up, they produced from 14 to 16 bolls Aberdeen measure. In June I observed, that potatoes which had been planted in the ordinary way in other parts of the parish in the middle of April were scarcely appearing above ground when there were so high as to require being earthed up with the plough; so that six weeks were gained in growth by this method.\n\nDuring the late great dearth of all kinds of provisions, a plan was adopted with a view to save for food a part of the potatoes used as seed, which consisted of not cutting them into pieces with one or more eyes in each piece, as usual, but of slightly scooping out the eyes, which in that state were planted while the greater part of the potato was preserved for the use of man or cattle. This mode of planting potatoes was successful with a great number of persons; but in some instances, where the ground was not in an excellent state of preparation, the crop is understood to have been more defective than when the usual mode was adopted of cutting off large pieces of the potato along with the eye. The point, however, about the utility of this mode of practice must still be considered as doubtful or worthy of farther investigation. We are rather disposed to think that the practice of slightly scooping out the eye will not ultimately prove beneficial, because in ordinary cases the plant will be left destitute of due nourishment from the parent root at too early a period of its growth, and before it is completely capable of deriving its subsistence from the soil around it; in the same manner, and for the same reason, that light feed is apt to produce a light crop of grain. This objection may not indeed hold good with regard to potatoes planted on a very fine soil, or upon a hot-bed, for transplanting after the manner adopted by Sir Archibald Grant above mentioned. But on poor lands, where the strength of the young plants is more severely tried, any defect in the size of the root planted will probably always be productive of bad effects.\n\n2. Turnip.\n\nTurnip delights in a gravelly soil; and there it can be raised to the greatest perfection, and with the least hazard of miscarriage. At the same time, there is no soil but will bear turnip when well prepared.\n\nNo person ever deserved better of a country, than he who first cultivated turnip in the field. No plant is better fitted for the climate of Britain, no plant prospers better in the coldest part of it, and no plant contributes more to fertility. In a word, there has not for two centuries been introduced into Britain a more valuable improvement.\n\nOf all roots, turnip requires the finest mould; and to that end, of all harrows frost is the best. In order to give access to frost, the land ought to be prepared by ribbing after harvest, as above directed in preparing soil for barley. If the field be not subject to annuals, it may lie in that state till the end of May; otherwise, the weeds must be destroyed by a braking about the middle of April, and again in May, if weeds arise.\n\nThe first week of June, plough the field with a shallow furrow. Lime it if requisite, and harrow the lime into the soil. Draw single furrows with intervals of three feet, and lay dung in the furrows. Cover the dung sufficiently, by going round it with the plough, and forming the three feet spaces into ridges. The dung comes thus to lie below the crown of every ridge.\n\nThe season of sowing must be regulated by the time season and intended for feeding. Where intended for feeding in November, December, January, and February, the feed ought to be sown from the first to the 20th of June. Where the feeding is intended to be carried on to March, April, and May, the feed must not be sown till the end of July. Turnip sown earlier than above directed, flowers that very summer, and runs fast to feed; which renders it in a great measure unfit for food. If sown much later, it does not apple, and there is no food but from the leaves.\n\nThough by a drill plough the seed may be sown of any thickness; the safest way is to sow thick. Thin sowing is liable to many accidents, which are far from being counterbalanced by the expense that is saved in thinning. Thick sowing can bear the ravage of the black fly, and leave a sufficient crop behind. It is a protection against drought, gives the plants a rapid growth, and establishes them in the ground before it is necessary to thin them.\n\nThe sowing turnip broad-cast is almost universal in England, and common in Scotland, though a barbarous practice. The eminent advantage of turnip is, that, besides a profitable crop, it makes a most complete fallow; and the latter cannot be obtained but by horse-hoeing. Upon that account, the sowing turnip in rows at three feet distance is recommended. Wider rows answer no profitable end, straiter rows afford not room for a horse to walk in. When the turnip is about four inches high, annual weeds will appear. Go round every interval with the slightest furrow possible, at the distance of two inches from each row, moving the earth from the rows toward the middle of the interval. A thin plate of iron must be fixed on the left side of the plough, to prevent the earth from falling back and burying the turnip. Next, let women be employed to weed the rows with their fingers; which is better, and cheaper done, than with the hand-hoe. The hand-hoe, beside, is apt to disturb the roots of the turnip that are to stand, and to leave them open to drought by removing the earth from them. The standing turnip are to be at the distance of twelve inches from each other; a greater distance makes them swell too much; a less distance affords them not sufficient room. A woman soon comes to be expert in finger-weeding. The following hint may be necessary to a learner. To secure the turnip that is to stand, let her cover it with the left hand; and with the right pull up the turnip on both sides. After thus freeing the standing turnip, she may safely use both hands. Let the field remain in this state till the appearance of new annuals make a second ploughing.\nCulture of ploughing necessary; which must be in the same furrow with the former, but a little deeper. As in this ploughing the iron plate is to be removed, part of the loose earth will fall back on the roots of the plants; the rest will fill the middle of the interval, and bury every weed. When weeds begin again to appear, then is the time for a third ploughing in an opposite direction, which lays the earth to the roots of the plants. This ploughing may be about the middle of August; after which, weeds rise very faintly. If they do rise, another ploughing will clear the ground of them. Weeds that at this time rise in the row, may be cleared with a hand-hoe, which can do little mischief among plants distant twelve inches from each other. It is certain, however, that it may be done cheaper with the hand (g). And after the leaves of turnips in a row meet together, the hand is the only instrument that can be applied for weeding.\n\nIn swampy ground, the surface of which is best reduced by paring and burning, the feed may be sown in rows with intervals of a foot. To save time, a drill-plough may be used that sows three or four rows at once. Hand-hoeing is proper for such ground; because the soil under the burnt stratum is commonly full of roots, which digest and rot better underground than when brought to the surface by the plough. In the mean time, while these are digesting, the ashes will secure a good crop.\n\nIn cultivating turnips to advantage, great care should be taken to procure a good, bright, nimble, and well-dried feed, and of the best kinds.\n\nThe Norfolk farmers generally raise the oval white, the large green-topped, and the red or purple-topped kinds, which from long experience they have found to be the most profitable.\n\nThe roots of the green-topped will grow to a large size, and continue good much longer than others. The red or purple-topped will also grow large, and continue good to the beginning of February; but the roots become hard and stringy sooner than the former.\n\nThe green-topped growing more above ground, is in more danger of sustaining injury from severe frosts than the red or purple, which are more than half covered by the soil; but it is the softest and sweetest, when grown large, of any kind. We have seen them brought to table a foot in diameter, and equally good as garden-turnips.\n\nTurnips delight in a light soil, consisting of sand and loam mixed; for when the soil is rich and heavy, although the crop may be as great in weight, they will be rank, and run to flower earlier in spring.\n\nTurnip-feed, like that of grain, will not do well without frequent changing. The Norfolk feed is sent to most parts of the kingdom, and even to Ireland; but after two years it degenerates; so that those who wish to have turnips in perfection should procure it fresh every year from Norwich, and they will find their account in so doing. For from its known reputation, many of the London feedmen sell, under that character, seed raised in the vicinity of the metropolis, which is much inferior in quality.\n\nWhen the plants have got five leaves, they should be hoed, and set out at least six inches apart. A month afterward, or earlier if it be a wet season, a second hoeing should take place, and the plants be left at least 14 inches distant from each other, especially if intended for feeding cattle; for where the plants are left thicker, they will be proportionally smaller, unless the land is very rich indeed.\n\nSome of the best Norfolk farmers sow turnips in drills three feet asunder, and at a second hoeing leave culture in them a foot apart in the rows. By this means the trouble and expense of hoeing is much lessened, and the crop is of equal weight as when sown in the common method. The intervals may easily be cleared of weeds by the horse-hoe.\n\nThere has been laid before the Board of Agriculture, the result of some interesting experiments, which we shall here state, that were made by Mr W. Jobson of Turvelaws, with a view to ascertain the comparative merits of the two modes of rearing turnips by drill or broad-cast. The trial was made upon a part of a field of 15 acres sown in the month of June 1797. \"The turnip by whole field, says Mr Jobson, was in equal tilth, was drill and mannered as equally as possible immediately before broad-cast sowing with rotted fold-yard dung, at the rate of 17 cart loads per acre, each load containing about 28 Winchester bushels; and in order to make the experiment perfectly fair, there were breadths of land of 20 yards each, sown in broad-cast and drills alternately throughout the whole field. Part of the drills on one-bout ridges of 27 inches each, with the dung laid immediately underneath, where the row of feed was deposited; the rest of the drills upon a level surface, were sown by Mr Bailey's machine at 21 inches distance. The produce per acre is calculated from the weight of four square perches, or the fortieth part of a statute acre of each, having first cut off the tails, or fibrous part of the root, and thrown them aside as unfit for food, and then taken the weight of the tops and roots separately.\n\n\"It is necessary to observe, that this field of turnip was but a middling crop, having been much hurt immediately after the first hoeing, by the grub (a small worm which destroys the root), particularly the drilled part of the field, which, having had the plants set out, at the distances at which they were intended to remain before the grub seized them, was on that account rendered too thin and otherwise much injured; notwithstanding which, it was found that those on the one-bout ridges exceeded the others in weight; also, that these parcels of turnips were taken from an inferior (though not the worst) part of the field, and may therefore be deemed to be a pretty fair average of the whole:\n\n(g) Children under thirteen may be employed to weed turnips with the fingers. We have seen them go on in that work with alacrity; and a small premium will have a good effect. For boys and girls above thirteen, a hand-hoe adapted to their size is an excellent instrument: it strengthens the arms amazingly. In driving the plough, the legs only are exercised; but as the arms are chiefly employed in husbandry, they ought to be prepared beforehand by gentle exercise.\nCulture of whole: there were also three other portions weighed, which were taken from a part of the field where the roots were larger, and a fuller crop, with a view to ascertain what might have been expected, had not the grub seized them in the manner described; but unfortunately the paper containing their weight has been lost or mislaid, which puts it out of my power to furnish you with it. There was also an account taken of the number (but not the weight) of loads which were produced upon a few acres of the worst part of the field which was in favour of the broad-cast, in the proportion of ten of broad-cast to nine of those drills on one-bout ridges, and eight of Mr Bayley's drill.\n\n\"From this experiment (though defective from the reasons assigned) we have reason to conjecture, though not to form a conclusion, that a heavier crop may be raised by sowing in drills at 27 inches distance with the dung immediately beneath the plants, then in broad-cast or in drills at 21 inches on a level surface; but whether the advantage arises from the situation in which the dung is deposited, or from their having a freer circulation of air, or from both these united, it remains for future and repeated experiments to decide. Notwithstanding this, it will be found, that each of these methods possesses peculiar advantages and disadvantages, according to situations and circumstances; the reasons for which I deduce from the observations I have made reflecting this as well as former crops. In the first place, the one-bout ridges I think preferable for early sowing, and eating off, through the winter months, even so late as the month of February, as they are more easily procured for food for cattle in deep snows; also in situations where it is difficult to procure a sufficient number of experienced hoers, those under the drill system can be more easily managed and at less expense, as boys and girls may be readily taught to set out the plants with great regularity in very little time; but turnips under this system are liable to the inconvenience of being more apt to be injured by severe frosts from their high exposure. Another inconvenience I have also observed on wet and heavy lands, more especially with little declivity, that although there should, and possibly may, be a larger crop produced thereby, yet the land will unavoidably be so much poached by carrying them off, that the succeeding crop of corn will be lessened more than the extra value of the turnips will compensate. When it is attempted to raise turnips upon land of this description, it will be found more advantageous to form it into ridges of sufficient height to carry off the water with ease into the water furrows, and of sufficient breadth (suppose fifteen feet) to allow a cart to pass along them freely, without forcing the earth in to choke up these furrows. The turnips may be sown either in broad-cast or in drills, upon the surface of these ridges. If the land is addicted to annual weeds, they will be best in drills, which will expedite the hoeing; but if not, or if they be late in sowing, or if the land be subject to the grub, broad-cast will generally be found to produce a more certain crop, as they can be left so near to each other at the first hoeing as to admit of being thinned, and thereby give the opportunity of taking out unhealthy plants at the subsequent hoeings, and also that they grow more vigorously between the first and second hoeings.\"\n\nThe result of the experiment here alluded to, is stated in the following manner:\n\n**Comparative Weight of six portions of Turnips, which were part of a Field of fifteen Acres: the whole of which was Sown in the Month of June 1797, as an experiment between the Drill and Broad-cast systems.**\n\n| Time of weighing | Number upon four square perches. | Weight on four square perches, or the 40th part of an acre. | Weight per statute acre. | Average weight of each turnip. | Average distance of each turnip. |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| No I.

In feeding them off, the cattle should not be suffered to run over too much of the ground at once, for in that case they will tread down and spoil twice as many as they eat. In Norfolk, they are confined by hurdles as much as is sufficient for them for one day. By this mode the crop is eaten clean, the soil is equally trodden, which if light is of much service, and equally manured by the cattle.\n\nA notion prevails in many places, that mutton fattened with turnips is thereby rendered rank and ill tasted; but this is a vulgar error. The best mutton in Norfolk (and few counties have better) is all fed with turnips. It is by rank pastures, and marshy lands, that rank mutton is produced.\n\nIf the land be wet and springy, the best method is to draw and carry off your turnips to some dry pasture; for the treading of the cattle will not only injure the crop, but render the land so stiff, that you must be at an additional expense in ploughing.\n\nTo preserve turnips for late spring feed, the best method, and which has been tried with success by some of the best English farmers, is, To stack them up in dry straw; a load of which is sufficient to preserve 40 tons of turnips. The method is easy, and is as follows:\n\nAfter drawing your turnips in February, cut off the tops and tap roots (which may be given to sheep), and let them lie a few days in the field, as no weather will then hurt them.\n\nThen, on a layer of straw next the ground, place a layer of turnips two feet thick; and then another layer of straw, and so on alternately, till you have brought the heap to a point. Care must be taken to turn up the edges of the layers of straw, to prevent the turnips from rolling out; cover the top well with long straw, and it will serve as a thatch for the whole.\n\nIn this method, as the straw imbibes the moisture exhaled from the roots, all vegetation will be prevented, and the turnips will be nearly as good in May as when first drawn from the field. If straw be scarce, old haulm or stubble will answer the same purpose.\n\nBut to prevent this trouble and expense, perhaps farmers in all counties would find it most to their interest to adopt the method used by our neighbours the Norfolk farmers, which is, to continue feeding turnips to the latter end of August; by which means their late crops remain good in the field till the latter end of April, and often till the middle of May.\n\nThe advantages of having turnips good till the spring feed is generally ready, are so obvious, and so great, that many of the most intelligent farmers (although at first prejudiced against the practice) are now come into it, and find their account in so doing.\n\nTurnips have long been in such general use as food for cattle, that the profit on raising them might be reasonably thought to be altogether certain; nevertheless said to be, Mr Young, in the paper already quoted, informs us, that \"turnips dugged for are universally a losing crop; for if they are slated from 30s. to 40s. an acre, their value does not amount to the dung alone which is spread for potatoes; yet the latter pays that dung, all other expenses, and leaves a profit sometimes considerable.\" I admit that turnips fed upon the land will prepare better for corn; but that is by no means the question. Would not the dung raised in the farmyard by the consumption of the potatoes, supposing it spread on the potato acre, make that produce more than the turnip one? I have no doubt but it would give a superiority. But turnips are liable to great failures, and cannot be relied on late in the spring; potatoes may; and are applicable to uses to which the other root cannot be applied.\"—In the second volume of the Bath Papers, p. 101, we have a comparative account with other of the value of turnips, turnip-rooted cabbage, and lucerne, as food for cattle. The result of this writer's observations is, that \"when sheep are allowed as many turnips as they can eat (which should always be the case when they are fattening), they will, on an average, eat near 20 pounds each in 24 hours. An acre of turnips twice hoed, will, if the land be good, produce about fifty tons; which will, on the above calculation, maintain 100 sheep 52 days. The sheep mentioned weigh 20 pounds per quarter. An acre of turnip-rooted cabbage will maintain 100 sheep for a month, and sometimes five weeks; but an acre of Scots cabbages will maintain 200 sheep a full month.\" The number fed by lucerne is not determined.\n\nThe greatest disadvantage which attends a crop of turnips, is their being so ready to be damaged by the earwig and the fly, which sometimes destroys them so completely, that great inconvenience is felt. They must be sown over again two or three times the same season, and even this without any certainty of success. Innumerable methods of avoiding this evil have been projected, which may all be reduced to the following clauses: 1. Steeping the seed in certain liquids. 2. Fumigation of the fields with the smoke of certain herbs. 3. Rolling. 4. Strewning loam, lime, ashes, &c., on the surface of the ground. It is very difficult, however, to determine, with any degree of certainty, whether remedies of this kind are effectual or not; because sometimes the turnips are not injured though no precaution has been made use of; and when this happens to be the case, after the use of any supposed preventive, the preservation of the crop is ascribed to the use of that preventive, whether it be really efficacious or not. The virtues of steeps seem to have been fully ascertained by Mr Winter Charlton near Bristol, of whose experiments an account is given in the Transactions of the Society for Encouraging Arts, vol. v. Whether the use of any seeds were of the Dutch kind, sowed on beds in the kitchen garden in drills, about twelve inches distant, an inch and a half deep, on the 11th of May 1786. The beds had been prepared with rotten dung in May 1785, and afterwards sown with cabbages. The quality of the turnips is exhibited in the following table;\nCulture of the best being marked 1; and those of inferior quality, 2, 3, &c. The observations were taken on the 26th of June.\n\nSeed without any preparation,\nsteeped in train oil, flourished extremely,\nsteeped in linseed oil, somewhat inferior,\nSeed mixed with foot and water,\nwith drainings of a dunghill,\nwith elder and barton draining,\nwith foot,\nwith elder leaf juice,\nwith elder and barton draining, foot being sowed over the covered drills,\nwith ditto, and lime sowed over the drills,\nsowed with foot scattered over, and then covered,\nwith barton draining,\nan elder bush drawn over when the plants appeared,\nwith stale human urine, very few plants appeared,\nwith flaked lime scattered over, and then covered, very few plants appeared,\nwith elder, barton-draining, and flaked lime, very few plants appeared,\nwith lime and barton-draining did not vegetate.\n\nAnother set of experiments was made with the green Norfolk turnip, drilled an inch and a half deep, the rows one foot distant, on beds eight feet three inches long, and two feet wide; half a drachm of seed allowed for each bed, steeped and mixed with various substances like the former. The seeds were drilled upon unmanured ground on the 20th of June 1786, and the observation made on the 17th of July. None of the beds were found free from the ravages of the fly; but the seeds which had been steeped in train oil and linseed oil were much more free from this injury than the others. The linseed oil, as in the former experiment, was found inferior to the train oil, which was supposed to have been owing to its being kept in a bottle that had formerly held oil of turpentine. The leaves of the steeped seeds were of a much darker green than the others, appeared twice as thick in bulk and luxuriancy, and the plants were considerably larger than those of the other kinds. The substances mixed with the rest were soaps ashes, wood ashes, pounded gunpowder, brimstone, flaked lime, foot, barton-draining; sometimes mixed together in various proportions, and sometimes with the addition of a portion of sifted mould.\n\nThese experiments show, that no dependence can be had on steeps or mixtures of any kind with the turnip-seed; though the train oil and linseed oil seem greatly to have forwarded the vegetation of the plant. It does not appear that fumigation has ever been tried; nor indeed does it seem easy to be tried in such a manner as might ensure success.—In the fourth volume of the Bath Papers, Mr Gullet of Devonshire gives such directions for performing the operation as he thinks would be productive of success.—In a preceding paper he had explained the good effects of fumigating orchards; but the case with these must be very considerably different from a field of turnips. The trees in an orchard are elevated above the ground, and the smoke naturally ascends, and is blown along their tops; but in fumigating a large field of turnips, it must creep along the ground in such a manner as is by no means agreeable to its nature; and without any excessive degree of labour, as well as a vast quantity of burning materials, there cannot be the least hope of success. Mr Gullet's directions are as follow: \"If the turnip-ground be ploughed and burnt, or the weeds, &c. burnt without spading, the fumigation thereby may suffice to chase such of the winged tribe from thence as are there then; but in all cases, when the field is ploughed and ready for sowing, let heaps be made at different places and intervals round by the hedges and boundaries of the turnip-ground, and some few scattered through the field; then, as soon as the seed is sown, let the heaps on the windward side and the scattered ones be lighted and kept smothering during the continuance of the wind in that quarter; the less the fire, and the more the smoke, the better. Should the wind happen to shift, those heaps on the quarter it shifts to must then be lighted and kept smothering in like manner; so that during the growth of the tender turnip leaf, and until it becomes rough and out of all danger, this fumigation and smoke, over and across the field, must be continued from one quarter to the other; which I venture to affirm, will effectually deter and prevent any winged insect tribe from approaching the turnip-ground: nay more, if there already, it would most completely drive them from thence, as such delicately formed insects (which can only feed on the most tender leaf) would be ill able to continue long in such a smother of fire and smoke. The consequence is obvious and certain, that if the fly be kept from approaching the field, the turnip-crop is safe; and few, I believe, will disagree with me, that prevention is better than remedy.\"\n\nOur author does not say that he has ever tried this method with turnips; but lays great stress upon his success in a similar experiment with cabbages, in order to preserve them from the caterpillar. To make the matter more sure, however, he recommends the trailing of a bush of elder over the turnip field at the time of harrowing or brushing in the seed; but this remedy has by numberless experiments been found insignificant, and by those above related seems even to be pernicious; so that whatever good effects we can expect from this method, must depend on the fumigation alone; and even this is attended with very great uncertainties, as has already been observed.\n\nRolling promises to be of service when the young turnips are attacked by snails, which frequently destroy them; but it cannot be supposed to have much effect in destroying flies, these being too numerous and too minute to be effectually crushed by the roller: and indeed, though this has been frequently recommended, we have no decisive proofs of its having ever been attended with any good effect.\n\nThe strewing of foot, lime, ashes, &c. upon the ground, have been determined ineffectual by the experiments already related; at least when applied before the turnips come up; and there seems to be little hope of their proving more effectual even when applied after the crop has appeared above ground. We may argue\nCulture of indeed *à priori* about the taste or smell of root, lime, particular &c., being disagreeable to insects; but of this we have no proof; and even though this were the case, the leaf soon emerges from under this covering, or the insects will feed on the under part of the leaves, where these febrilities cannot lie. It is evident, therefore, that very little can be expected from any of the methods hitherto proposed either by way of cure or prevention. The more probable methods are,\n\n1. To sow the turnips at such a season of the year that they may be well grown before the fly makes its appearance. In the Bath Papers, vol. iv. p. 132. Mr Wimpey observes, that in order to procure food for their cattle in the spring before the grass is grown, farmers are obliged to postpone the sowing of turnips beyond the natural time of vegetation; but were turnips to be sown in April, as soon as the season would permit, it is very probable that there would be as great a crop of them as of other vegetables usually sown in these months. On account of the delay in sowing, however, for the reason already mentioned, the success of the farmer becomes exceedingly precarious, unless he is so fortunate as to have a few rainy days, or cloudy weather and frequent showers, soon after the seed is sown; and this our author supposes to be the true reason why the turnip is a more uncertain article than any other. But though speculations of this kind have a great show of probability, there is not any experiment hitherto published, even by our author himself, by which the truth of the above conjecture can be absolutely ascertained.\n\nOur author, however, is of opinion, that none of the common methods proposed can answer any good purpose, farther than as by means of them the vegetation of the plant may be invigorated. Mr Wimpey recommends ashes, root, or a rich compost of lime and dung, used in sufficient quantities; but the method of using them is, either to sow them with the seed, or rather by themselves immediately before, and to harrow them well in, that they may be completely incorporated with the soil. This for the most part would so invigorate and encourage the growth of the plants, as to be an overmatch for the most vigorous attacks of the fly.\n\n2. Another method proposed for securing turnips from the fly, is by sowing such a quantity of seed as will be more than sufficient for the consumption of the insects. This we find recommended in a letter to the Bath Society, by a gentleman-farmer in Essex, vol. ii. p. 238. His method is to make the land clean and fine as soon as the season will permit, and to sow four pints per acre. It may be objected, that if the fly does not take them, the plants will stand too thick, that they cannot easily be hoed; but this may be obviated by harrowing them first, which will make them fit for the hoe. There can be no expectation of a crop if the fly takes them when only a pint of seed is sown per acre; but this gentleman remarks, that he has not in any one instance missed of a crop when he sowed four pints; because, though the fly has sometimes destroyed more than one half, and much damaged the other, still there was a sufficient number left behind. He also agrees with other of the Society's correspondents, that the ground should be well dugged and manured previous to the sowing of turnips, as this makes them grow vigorousfly, so that they quickly get into the rough leaf, in which state the fly will not touch them.\n\nIn the same volume, a gentleman of Norfolk remarks, that manuring the ground in autumn for turnips is preferable to the doing so in spring. This discovery he made in consequence of the following accident.—A neighbouring farmer, not having a sufficient quantity of manure for all his turnip land, was under the necessity in autumn of sowing four acres unmanured. The effect was, that the turnips on the manured part of the land were mostly eaten off by the fly, while four acres unmanured escaped without injury. In consequence of having observed this, the gentleman made a similar experiment, by manuring five acres well for turnips, and tilling three acres and a half in the usual way without any manure. The manured crops were almost all destroyed by the fly, so that he was obliged to sow most of the land over again. The three acres and a half which had no manure were entirely free from injury, though the plants were much smaller than those of the manured ground which came up. Not content with this trial, however, he repeated the experiment, by manuring five acres of wheat stubble in autumn, ploughing it immediately, and leaving it to incorporate with the earth during the winter; the turnips which grew upon this were as large as if the ground had been manured in the spring. This experiment was repeated with surprising success in two succeeding years; whence he infers, that the fly is either engendered in the new dung or enticed by it. But when the manure is laid on in autumn it loses its noxious qualities, though it still retains its nutritive ones.—This conclusion, however, does not appear to be well founded; for it is certain from undoubted experience, that turnips which have been well manured in the common way, have sometimes escaped any injury; while others, which have got no manure at all, have been almost totally destroyed. Another material advantage, however, which this correspondent observes is to be derived from manuring in autumn is, that all the seeds contained in the manure, and which are of course carried to the land with it, vegetate almost immediately, and are mostly killed by the cold of the succeeding winter, while the few that remain can scarce escape destruction from the ploughshare.\n\nMr Wimpey is also of opinion, that it is proper to Mr Wimpey sow a large quantity of seed; but thinks two pounds per acre will be sufficient for an acre. A few ounces indeed would be sufficient to stock the land; but as the article is so precarious, he thinks it by far the safest way to allow feed in plenty, and reduce the plants afterwards by harrowing. He observes also, that it is of great consequence to have feed both good in quality and of the best species. He prefers the large and green topped, as being the most sweet and juicy; others give the preference to the red or purple-topped, as being hardier; but at any rate, the feed from the largest and finest transplanted turnips, of whatever sort, is greatly of the best to be preferred, even though it should cost double or treble the price. Such as is sold by the feedmen in the feed. London he found generally of a mixed kind, and often in great part not worth cultivating. Whether plants from new or old feed are most secure from the depredations of the fly (says he), is perhaps a question which cannot be easily determined even by experiments; for concomitant circumstances are frequently so much more operative and powerful, as to render the difference between\nCulture of particular Plants.\n\nOf sowing turnips with grain.\n\nWith wheat.\n\nMr Anderdon's experiments of sowing them with beans.\n\nObjections by the Bath Society.\n\nCulture of particular Plants.\n\nPractice.\n\nThe sowing of turnips along with grain.—This, of all others, seems to be the most eligible and efficacious. In the second volume of Bath Papers, p. 210, a Hertfordshire correspondent gives an account of the success of an experiment of drilling turnips with wheat. A small field of spring-wheat was drilled in rows two feet apart; and in the month of May turnips were sown by hand in the intervals. They came up very well, and were thinned once by the hoe. The crop of wheat turned out better than another field of the same soil sown broad-cast in autumn, though it ripened somewhat later. The turnips were no other way injured by cutting it, than having some of the large leaves trodden down by the reapers. After harvest the weeds were cut up round the turnips with a hand-hoe, and they grew very large and vigorous. They were of the purple and white long kind, and the crop proved nearly as good as the same land produced in common. An excellent crop of barley and clover was got from the same field afterwards.\n\nIn the third volume of the same work we find an account of several successful experiments in sowing turnips between rows of beans. The advantages of this method are strongly set forth by R. P. Anderdon, Esq.; who made some of the experiments, and are as follow:\n\n1. You may have a crop of beans and turnips on the same field the same year.\n2. The bean crop being well horse-hoed, no ploughing is wanted for turnips, for which the best Norfolk farmers give five ploughings.\n3. It is hoed cheaper, more effectually, and consequently more profitably, than in any other way.\n4. The ground is kept clean from weeds.\n5. It is in order for a Lent crop the succeeding year with one earth.\n6. The ground is kept in heart, if not improved, by following your alleys.\n7. It brings the plant to perfection in poor ground, where it would not become so otherwise.\n8. It doubles the crop in any ground which Mr Anderdon has had experience of.\n9. You have the crops more within your own power in this than in any other method, let the seasons turn out as they will.\n10. You may have on the same ground a bean and turnip crop annually, if the land be suitable, and you think proper.\n11. The clay farmer, by this mode, renders land which is naturally unfit for turnips, so free and open by leaflow horse-hoings, that it will bring this useful plant to great perfection.\"\n\nOn this paper the society made some remarks, and stated the following objections: 1. The same soil cannot be proper for both crops. Scotch cabbages are more adapted for a bean soil; and they wished him to repeat the experiment with cabbages instead of turnips betwixt his beans. 2. The Norfolk farmers rarely use more than three ploughings for turnips, instead of five, as Mr Anderdon represents, unless the ground be full of couch grass. 3. They think him too sanguine in his expectations of having double crops on the same field. 4. Nothing renders a clay soil so free and open as to have it exposed to frosts and snow by being laid up in high ridges in January and February; but, on Mr Anderdon's plan, this cannot be done, unless the turnips are lessened in value by being fed off in autumn.\n\nThese strictures were sent to Mr Anderdon before the papers were printed, but did not make any alteration in his opinion; and he replied to the following purpose:\n\n\"The same soil cannot be proper for beans and turnips, &c.—Granted.—But had Mr Anderdon adhered rigidly to this rule, he would have sowed no turnips at all, not having on his farm any soil altogether proper for that crop; \"but (says he) while I can get in single rows, four feet asunder or more, from half a dozen to half a score tons of turnips per acre, after, or rather between, a crop of beans in my heavy lands, I shall feel that product here more beneficial than to drop the mode. I believe the medium of the two, so far as I can judge by the eye or get information, to be superior to the average produce of prepared fallow turnip crops in 10 miles round me.\"—On this the Society make the following remarks: \"The question here is, Whether, if instead of turnips, Mr Anderdon had planted his beans two feet distance only, the extra produce of his crop would not have exceeded in value that of his turnips? We think they would, as these intervals would freely admit his horse-hoe between the beans.\"\n\nMr Anderdon then proceeds to acquaint the committee, that he had tried the experiment as they wished with Scotch cabbages instead of turnips betwixt the rows of beans; but the crop of the turnips was so much preferable, that he found himself inclined to suppose the cabbage would not get to so great perfection there as to be profitably introduced on a large scale, for want of the great quantity of dung necessary for that crop, and which could not be procured in that part of the country. He further remarks in favour of turnips, that they have an abundance of very small lateral fibrous roots, which run as far in search of food, and feed as ravenously where they can penetrate, as those of almost any other vegetable; and the plant certainly derives more nourishment from those than from its tap-root (h). Those fine fibrous roots, almost imperceptible to the eye, issue chiefly from the apple or body of the turnip, and get into the richest part of the soil near the surface, and will bring the plants to a considerable magnitude in heavy lands adapted to beans, when mellowed by the horse-hoe. Some of his turnips weighed ten pounds each; and if he could have only two such turnips on every square yard, it would be at the rate of 43 tons per acre.\n\n2. The Committee doubts of the possibility of doubling the crop. Mr Anderdon gives the following explanation.\n\n(h) Here the society remark, that this is not the case with those kinds of turnips which grow chiefly above ground, and which are generally the best crops, and most capable of resisting the frosts.\nCulture of \"I have made many comparative trials on turnips between this mode and broad-cast sowing, and always found on my ground the horse-hoe crops the best.\n\nBut here, in denoting the benefits of the horse-hoe by its doubling a crop, I wish to be understood, that if, in soils like mine, a crop be drilled, leaving proper intervals for horde-hoeing, and one part be horde-hoed the other not, the horde-hoed part will double the other in product.\"\n\nMr Anderdon, in the course of his reply to the committee, gives an account of another experiment he made in consequence of being deficient in winter fodder for his cattle. By this necessity he was induced to sow turnips wherever he could; and on the 18th of July drilled a single row between his drilled wheat. On the 20th and 22d of August he drilled four rows of winter vetches in each interval between the turnips, at the rate of less than one peck and three quarters of seed to an acre. \"The turnip crop (says he) is very acceptable, and my vetches succeed beyond my warmest expectation; they are thick enough, and give me the pleasing prospect and hope, that I shall not, when my dry meat is gone, want a reasonable supply of early green fodder that will last me till my lucerne comes on.\"\n\nThis subject is farther considered in the same volume by Mr Pavier, who viewed Mr Anderdon's turnips, and gave in a report of them to the committee. He supposes a crop of beans drilled in single rows at four feet distance, and the turnips drilled in the intervals, according to Mr Anderdon's method, there will then be four rows of 17 feet in length to make a square perch; whereas Mr Anderdon's rows were only 15 feet 8 inches in length; and this disparity in length will make a difference of weight on a perch from 230 to 249 pounds, and on an acre from 16 tons 8 cwt. 2 qrs. 8 lb. Mr Anderdon's produce, to 17 tons 15 cwt. 2 qrs. 24 lb.—Each turnip at this distance (viz., four feet from row to row, and nine inches in the rows) must occupy a space of three square feet; consequently the greatest number produced on an acre must be 14,520; but if sown in broad-cast, twice hoed, and the distance on an average 15 inches, each turnip will then occupy little more than one foot and a half, and the number produced on an acre may be about 27,920; an excess which may reasonably be supposed to overbalance the value of the beans, let us suppose the crop as great as we can reasonably do. Thus far the argument seems to lie against this method of cultivating beans and turnips together; but on the other hand, Mr Pavier considers it probable that the expense of drilling and horde-hoeing the beans, together with drilling the turnips in the manner Mr Anderdon did, must be considerably less than that of fallowing and preparing the ground, and sowing the turnips in broad-cast; to which we must likewise add the facility of hoeing the drills in comparison of the broad-cast. But besides these, the great advantage arising from this method, and which, if certain, gives it a decided superiority, is, \"the great chance, if not an almost certainty, of preserving the turnips from the depredations of the fly.\" Mr Pavier was inclined to think that this must be the case, as Mr Anderdon had such crops repeatedly without any damage of that kind; but the committee differ from him, and think that this must have proceeded from some other cause; though they do not assign any reason for this opinion. \"The principal point (says Mr Pavier), in determining this question, seems to me to be this: if the crop of beans drilled as above after deducting the seed, and some additional expense in taking the crop off the ground without injuring the turnips, can be, one year with another, supposed to be as valuable as the quantity of turnips that might be reasonably expected in the broad-cast method more than in the other, I should not hesitate to declare in favour of drilling between the beans.\"\n\nThus far the argument seems to be carried on a priori. Mr Wimpey, in the letter already quoted, inclines to the practice of sowing turnips between beans planted in rows. \"It exactly corresponds (says he) with all my observations on the successful vegetation of that root. A considerable degree of moisture is necessary to the rapid vegetation of that very juicy root, and nothing retains moisture equal to flake; and flake can be obtained and secured by no means so effectually on a large scale as in the intervals of tall growing plants, as beans or wheat planted in drills.\" The flake of Mr Bult of Kingston near Taunton, leaves little room to doubt of the propriety of the method, and its success in preventing the fly. The beans were planted in drills not quite two feet asunder, on two ploughings, horde-hoed three times, and the turnips sown in the intervals at the last hoeing. The field measured six acres and a quarter, and was a very good clayey soil, but had not been manured, nor had any dressing laid upon it for five years before. It produced this year three quarters of beans per acre, and 37 tons 5 cwt. of turnips. This field was also viewed by Mr Pavier, who makes the following observations upon it. 1. The turnips were sown promiscuously among the beans at the last hoeing, which was given about midsummer; from which time nothing was done but drawing off the beans and carrying them off the land. 2. The crop of beans was believed to be considerably above 20 bushels per acre, which is much more than was produced by any other method that season in the neighbouring part of the country; and as Mr Pavier had this account before he saw the turnip crop, he did not expect any thing considerable from the latter; but as it turned out, the produce must be accounted highly profitable, when we consider that there was no crop lost, no preparation, dressing, nor any expense whatever, excepting the price of the seed and sowing it. 3. This he considers as one of the strongest recommendations of the drill husbandry he ever knew or heard of; but he is of opinion that it never can answer except where the ground is perfectly clean and free from weeds, by the crops having been horde-hoed for a few years before. 4. He thinks the beans ought to have been planted at wider intervals, by which the sun and air would be freely admitted, and the plants would also be less damaged by the operation of the hoe.\n\nMr Pavier likewise informs the Society of two other experiments on a similar plan; but with this difference, permits that the turnips were sown among the beans at the second horde-hoeing. The turnip crops were very good, among the beans more than double the value of those raised in the usual mode of husbandry. \"I think it is very evident (says he), that the beans preserve the turnips from the fly; and as no expense or trouble attends\nCulture of the practice, I apprehend it will soon become more particular.\n\nThe Society own, that the uncommon success of Mr Bult's experiment seems to militate at least against what they said on Mr Anderdon's letter; but they insist that the cases are by no means similar. \"Though the land (say they), in both instances, is called a heavy clay, they are very different. Mr Anderdon's is poor, wet, and cold; the other a good rich clay; and we apprehend naturally mixed with a kind of marl, which is called clay by persons not thoroughly acquainted with the nice distinction of soils apparently alike, but very different in their nature. Our principle therefore, that cold wet clay lands are unsuitable for turnips, remains unaffected by this experiment; and general practice confirms the truth of the theory.\"\n\nIn another letter, Mr Pavier gives a more particular account of the two other crops of beans and turnips raised upon Mr Bult's plan. The beans were drilled in rows about 22 inches distance, twice horse-hoed, and the produce from about 25 to 30 bushels the computed acre, or from 30 to 36 bushels the statute acre. The preceding summer had been very unfavourable to beans, and the produce per acre in the common husbandry did not, on an average, equal a third part of this quantity. One of these crops was superior to that of Mr Bult: they were sown upon a field of nine computed acres on the 10th of June, after the second horse-hoeing; but whether the second hoeing was performed too soon, the ground not clean, or whatever might be the cause, the beans were weeded twice by hand afterwards; and he is of opinion, that the turnips were somewhat benefited by it. Mr Pavier was assured by a very intelligent farmer, that this was the best crop of turnips he had ever seen. The turnip-feed in the other crop was put in between the rows of beans by a hand drill; but the work was badly performed, the plants coming up in some places vastly too thick, and in others as much too thin; but wherever they happened to be of a proper thickness, the farmer told him it was one of the most profitable crops he ever had. The soil was wet, heavy, and not very favourable for turnips. Hence Mr Pavier deduces the following conclusions: 1. That with respect to beans in particular, the drilling and horse-hoeing is vastly superior to the common mode of husbandry. 2. That the beans are undoubtedly a good preservative of the turnips from the depredations of the fly. 3. That as by this method no crop is lost, and consequently no rent, but a mere trifle of expense (if any) chargeable to the turnip crop; it must be one of the most profitable as well as the most certain methods of propagating that useful root ever yet practised.—He still insists, however, that if he had an opportunity of trying this method, he would drill the beans in rows at a greater distance, that the turnips might be hand-hoed easily; and that he should prefer the London tick-bean to any other, by reason of their shortness and being such bearers; that he should also take off their tops as soon as the under blossoms began to decay; which, he supposes, would be of great service.\n\nIn this dissertation on the culture of turnips, we cannot avoid taking notice of an instrument used in Norfolk for transplanting them, and thus filling up the gaps which frequently happen in fields from the failure of the plants in particular spots. It is represented on the margin; and the construction and mode of using are obvious from the figure.—When the turnips are to be transplanted, the workman holds the long handle with the left hand, and the short one with the right hand drawn up. Put the instrument then over the plant that is to be taken up, and with your foot force it into the ground; then give it a twist round, and by drawing it gently up, the earth will adhere to the roots of the plant in a solid body; then with another instrument of the same size take the earth out where the plant is to be put, and bringing the instrument with the plant in it, put it into the hole which has been made by the other; then keep your right hand steady, and draw up your left, and the earth and plant will be left in the hole with the roots undisturbed. In this operation two men must be employed, each of them having an instrument of the form represented on the margin. One man takes up a plant while the other fills his instrument with earth only, thereby making room for the deposition of the plant; so that the hole which is made by taking up the plant is filled with the earth taken out where the plant is to be put; which being deposited, he takes up a plant, and returns to the place he first set out from, the former man at the same time returning with the earth only; so that each man is alternately the planter, and each being employed both ways, the work goes on briskly.—This instrument was the invention of Mr Cubitt Gray of Southrepps, Norfolk.\n\nTurnips being the grand basis of the Norfolk husbandry, Mr Marlhall gives a very particular account of their culture in that county.—The species cultivated are, 1. The common white stock, called in many places the Norfolk turnip. 2. The purple stock is similar to the former, but its rind is of a dark red or purple cultivation colour; its size in general smaller, and its texture of turnip clover and firmer than that of the common white stock; it also stands the winter better, and is more succulent in the spring, but it is not so well relished by cattle as the former; whence it is less generally cultivated. 3. The pudding-stock, the tan-bard-turnip of the midland counties, is in shape perfectly different from the common sort, that it might be ranked as a distinct species. It rises in a cylindrical form, eight, ten, or twelve inches high, standing in a manner wholly above ground; generally taking a rough irregular outline, and a somewhat reclining posture. It very much resembles the common turnip, and is by much its most formidable rival. In many respects it seems to be superior, particularly in being readily drawn, and eaten off by sheep with much less waste than the common turnip.—The disadvantage is, that they are liable to the attacks of frost, by reason of their standing so high above the surface of the ground; so that on the whole, Mr Marlhall concludes, that the common white turnip is to be preferred to every other.\n\nIn Norfolk, turnips are sown upon every species of arable land. Marl is found to be highly beneficial; and by means of this manure, a foil naturally unfit for turnips may be rendered proper for it. They succeed barley better than any other crop; some few are sown on wheat or pea stubble after harvest; but this is not a general practice. The manures in greatest reputation for turnips are dung, with a greater or smaller admixture...\nCulture of admixture of mould; *malt-coombs* are also in good repute, and oil-cake is used by a few individuals; \"but it may be said that nine acres of ten of the turnips grown in east Norfolk are manured with muck.\"—The quantity of dung set on for a crop of turnips generally depends on the quantity on hand, and the quantity of turnip ground to be manured. From 10 to 15 cartloads of muck are considered as a good dressing; and about a ton of oil cake to three acres; 50 or 60 bushels of malt-coombs, and 40 or 50 bushels of foot, to an acre.\n\nWhen the turnips are intended for early consumption, the sooner they can be got into the ground the better; but when they are intended to stand the winter, the beginning of July is thought soon enough. The most general rule is to begin sowing about a week before midsummer, and continue till about a fortnight after, viz. from the 17th or 18th of June to the 7th or 8th of July.—Broadcast sowing is universal, in which the quantity of two pints to an acre. The seed is covered by two lines of a pair of light harrows drawn backward, in order to prevent the lines, which usually point something forward, from tearing up the clods, and burying the seed too deep. The horses are universally walked one way, and trotted back again in the same place. This is an excellent custom; the quick zig-zag motion of the harrows at once afflicting to level the surface, and to distribute the seeds more evenly.—They are universally hoed; and unless they be sown very late, are generally hoed twice. The distance of time between the sowing and the first hoeing depends upon the soil and season; the size of the plants being the only guide. When turnips are suffered to grow too large before they are hoed, the plants are difficult to be let out singly, and are liable to be drawn up by weeds, thereby acquiring a slender upright tendency; whereas their natural growth, in their infant state, is procumbent, spreading their first leaves on the ground, and taking the form of a rosette.—If the hoe be put in too soon, the plants which are set out are liable to be buried, and their tender roots disturbed in the act of setting out the neighbouring plants. The time for hoeing, as directed by the most judicious husbandmen, is when the plants, as they lie spread upon the ground, are about the size of the palm of the hand; if, however, feed-weeds be numerous and luxuriant, they ought to be checked before the turnips arrive at that size, lest by being drawn up tall and slender they should acquire a weak and sickly habit. The proper distance depends upon the nature of the soil and the time of sowing; such as are sown early, in a rich productive soil, require to be set out wider than those sown late on a soil of a contrary nature. If the soil be at par, the distance ought to be regulated by the time of sowing: if this be at par, the nature or state of the soil should be the regulator.—Mr Marshall complains of the conduct of the Norfolk farmers in general in this respect, who \"hack out their turnips 14, 15, or perhaps 18 inches asunder, without any regard to the state of the soil, or time of sowing.\" This practice was established while the Norfolk soil was full of marl, and new to turnips; and when, it is probable, 10 or 12 inches in diameter was no uncommon size, with tops proportionally large and spreading; and 14, or 15, inches might then be a proper distance.\n\nBut now, when the efficacy of marl is lessened, and culture of the foil no longer the favourite of turnips, which seldom reach more than seven or eight inches in diameter, it is ruinous and absurd to continue the practice.\" Turnips are cultivated either for feed, for sale, or for consumption. When cultivated for feed, it is supposed in most parts of the kingdom that it ought always to be taken from transplanted roots; but in Norfolk they are frequently raised from such as are untransplanted. \"It is a fact (says Mr Marshall) well understood by every husbandman here, that if the seed be gathered repeatedly from untransplanted roots, the plants from this seed will become coarse-necked and foul-rooted; and the flesh of the root itself will become rigid and unpalatable. On the contrary, if it be gathered year after year from transplanted roots, the necks will become too fine, and the fibres too few; the entire plant acquiring a weak delicate habit, and the produce, though sweet, will be small. For the neck, or onset of the leaves, being reduced to the size of the finger (for instance), the number and size of the leaves will be reduced in proportion; and in a similar proportion will the number and size of the fibrils be reduced. From a parity of reasoning, it may perhaps be inferred, that when the neck acquires a thickness equal to that of the wrist, the size of the root will be in proportion.\n\n\"With respect to the fibres or rootlings, this is a just inference; but with respect to the bulb, it is in a great measure erroneous. For a few generations the size of the bulb will keep pace with the increase of leaves and fibres; but after having once reached the limits which nature has set to its magnitude, it begins to revert to its original state of wildness, from which to it present state it has undoubtedly been raised by transplantation. The farmer has therefore two extremes to avoid. The one is discoverable by the thickness and coarseness of the neck, the scaly roughness of the bulb, the thickness of the rind in general, the foulness of its bottom, and the forkedness of its main or tap-root: the other by the flenderness of the neck, the fineness of the leaf, and the delicacy of the root. The former are unpalatable to cattle, and are therefore creative of waste: The latter are unproductive, are difficult to be drawn, and do not throw out such ample tops in the spring, as do those which are, by constitution or habit, in a middle state between these two extremes. There is not, however, any general rule respecting how many years turnips ought to be transplanted successively, and how often they ought to be suffered to run up from the seed-bed: the soil and situation have, and other circumstances may have, influence on the habit and constitution of vegetables as of animals; and the farmer must attend alone to the state of the turnips themselves. Whenever he judges, that, by repeated transplantation, they have passed the acme of perfection, then it is his duty and interest to let them run up to feed without transplantation. In Norfolk it has been found, by long experience, that transplanting two, three, or four years, and letting the plants run up the third, fourth, or fifth, will keep the stock in the desired state. The time of transplanting is from Old Christmas to Old Candlemas. In the choice of plants, the farmer is not guided by size, but picks the cleanest plants without regard to size; or, more...\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nCulture of particular plants.\n\nMethod of planting.\n\nThe culture of more accurately speaking, he makes choice of such as are near, but not at or above the state of perfection. In almost every turnip-field there are plants in various states; much judgment, therefore, is requisite in the choice of plants. A piece of good ground near a habitation is generally chosen for this purpose; but the method of planting is various; the plants are generally set in rows, at uncertain distances from one another.\" These distances our author has observed to be 16 or 18 inches, and the distance of the plants in them nine or ten inches; but the practice of a man who, he tells us, is indubitably near the head of his profession, is to plant them in rows two feet asunder, the plants in the rows being contiguous. The only culture required, is to keep the intervals clean hoed; but when the seed begins to ripen, much care is requisite to keep it from birds. If the plot be large, it is necessary to employ a boy to scare them; but if it be small, and near the house, Mr Marshall has known the following expedient used with success. \"On a slender post, rising in the midst of the patch of seed, was fixed a bell; from which a line paffed into the kitchen; in the most frequented part of this hung the pull. Whoever paffed the pull rung the bell; so that in a farm-house kitchen, where a mistress and two or three maids were some of them almost always on the foot, an incessant peal was kept up; and the birds, having no reprieve from alarm, forfought their prey.\"\n\nThe time of drawing commences about Michaelmas, and continues until the plants be in blow. The process of drawing, he says, \"in severe weather is an employment which nothing but custom could reconcile to those whose lot it is to go through it, namely, stout lads and youths; whose hands are frequently swelled until the joints are discernible only by the dimples they form;\" nevertheless he never heard of any instance of bad effects from this circumstance. When the tops will bear it, their method of pulling is very expeditious: they pull with both hands at once; and having filled each hand, they bring the two together with a smart blow to disengage the foil from the roots, and with the same motion throw them into the cart. If the tops be cut off by the frosts, or if this be in the ground, the turnips are raised with two-tined forks named crowns. If the roots are buried under deep snow, it is removed by means of an implement called the snow-fledge. This consists of three deal-boards from one to two inches thick, 10 or 12 inches deep, and from seven to nine feet long, let upon their edges in the form of an equilateral triangle, and strongly united with nails or straps of iron at the angles; at one of which is fastened, by means of a double strap, a hook or an eye, to fasten the horses to. This being drawn over a piece of turnips covered with snow, forces up the latter into a ridge on each side, while between the ridges a stripe of turnips is left bare, without having received any material injury from the operation. Though it is customary, in drawing, to clear the ground entirely, our author met with one instance in which the small ones were left by a very good husbandman on the ground, both to increase in size, and to throw out tops in the spring; it being observable, that a small turnip sends up a top nearly equal to one whose bulb is larger. There is one inconvenience, however, arising from this practice: the plough is prevented from entering upon the foil until late in the spring; which particular upon some soils is an unfavourable objection; tho', it may be very proper upon land which will bring good barley with one ploughing after turnips.\n\nMr Marshall relates the following simple method, by which a Norfolk farmer preferred turnips through a preserving considerable part of the winter season. Having cut off their tops with a spade, he gave them to his cows, and carried the bulbs to a new-made ditch, into which he threw them, and then covered them up with straw, laying over it a quantity of bramble kids. Here they lay until wanted in a frost. They were then again carted by means of a fork, and given to the cattle, who ate them as well, or rather better than fresh drawn turnips; and in general they came out as fresh as they went in. Our author is of opinion, that this method might be extended to the preservation of turnips till the spring.\n\n3. CARROT.\n\nOf all roots, a carrot requires the deepest soil. It ought at least to be a foot deep, all equally good from top to bottom. If such a soil be not in the farm, it may be made artificially by trench-ploughing, which brings to the surface what never had any communication with the sun or air. When this new foil is sufficiently improved by a crop or two with dung, it is fit for bearing carrots. Beware of dunging the year when the carrots are sown; for with fresh dung they seldom escape rotten heads.\n\nThe only soils proper for that root are a loam and a sandy soil.\n\nThe ground must be prepared by the deepest furrow that can be taken, the sooner after harvest the better; immediately upon the back of which, a ribbing ought to succeed, as directed for barley. At the end of March, or beginning of April, which is the time of sowing the seed, the ground must be smoothed with a brake. Sow the seed in drills, with intervals of a foot for hand-hoeing: which is an expensive operation where the crop is confined to an acre or two: but if the quantity of ground be greater, the intervals ought to be three feet, in order for horse-hoeing.\n\nIn flat ground without ridges, it may be proper to make parallel furrows with the plough, ten feet from each other, in order to carry off any redundant moisture.\n\nAt Parlington in Yorkshire, from the end of September to the first of May, 20 work horses, four bullocks, and six milk cows, were fed on the carrots that grew on three acres; and these animals never tasted any other food but a little hay. The milk was excellent: and, over and above, 30 hogs were fattened upon what was left by the other beasts. We have this fact from undoubted authority.\n\nCarrots have been greatly recommended as food for cattle, and, in this respect, bid fair to rival the potato; though, with regard to the human species, they are far inferior. The profit attending the cultivation of them, however, appears to be much more doubtful than that of potatoes. Mr Arthur Young informs us, that from Norden's Surveyor's Dialogue, published in 1600, it appears, that carrots were commonly cultivated at that period, vol. ii., time about Oxford in Suffolk, and Norwich in Norfolk;\nfolk; and he remarks, that the tract of land between Orford, Woodbridge, and Saxmundham, has probably more carrots in it than all the rest of the kingdom put together.\" In 1779, few farmers in these parts had less than five or six acres; many from 10 to 20; and one had 36 acres; the straight, handsome, and clean roots were sent at 6d. per bushel to London; the rest being used at home, principally as food for horses. In other counties, he observes, the culture of carrots has not extended itself; that some have begun to cultivate them in place of turnips, but have soon desisted; so that the culture seems in a manner still confined to the angle of Suffolk, where it first began. In attempting to investigate the cause of this general neglect, he observes, that \"the charge of cultivation is not so great as is commonly imagined, when managed with an eye to an extensive culture, and not a confined one for one or two particular objects.\" Two acres which our author had in carrots cost £1. 17s. 6d. per acre, including every expense; but had not the summer been dry, he observes, that his expenses might have been much higher; and when he tried the experiment 15 years before, his expenses, through inadvertence, ran much higher. His difficulty this year arose chiefly from the polygonum aviculare, the predominant weed, which is so tough that scarcely any hoe can cut it. Some acres of turnips which he cultivated along with the carrots were all eaten by the fly; but had they succeeded, the expense of the crop would have been £18s. 6d. less per acre than the carrots. \"But (adds our author) if we call the superiority of expense £20s. an acre, I believe we shall be very near the truth: and it must at once be apparent that the expense of £20s. per acre cannot be the cause of the culture spreading to little; for, to answer this expense, there are favourable circumstances, which must not be forgotten. 1. They (the carrots) are much more impenetrable to frosts, which frequently destroy turnips. 2. They are not subject to the distempers and accidents which frequently affect turnips; and they are sown at a season when they cannot be affected by drought, which frequently also destroys turnips. 3. They last to April, when stock, and especially sheep farmers are so distressed, that they know not what resource to provide. 4. The culture requisite for turnips on a sandy soil, in order to destroy the weeds, destroys also its tenacity, so that the crop cannot thrive; but with carrots the case is otherwise. Hence it appears, that the reason why the cultivation of carrots is still so limited, does not arise from the expense, but because the value is not ascertained. In places where these roots can be sent to London, or sold at a good price, the tops being used as food for cattle, there is not the least doubt that they are profitable; and therefore in such places they are generally cultivated: but from the experiments as yet laid before the public, a satisfactory decisive knowledge of the value is not to be gained. The most considerable practice, and the only one of common farmers upon a large scale, is that of the lands of Woodbridge; but here they have the benefit of a London market, as already mentioned. Amongst those whose experiments are published, Mr Billinglsey ranks foremost. Here again the value of carrots is rather depreciated than advanced; for he raised great crops, and had repeated experience upon a large scale of their excellence in fattening oxen and sheep; feeding cows, horses, and hogs; and keeping ewes and lambs in a very superior manner, late in the spring, after turnips were gone: but notwithstanding these great advantages, he gave the culture up; from which we may conclude a deficiency in value. \"In several experiments (though not altogether determinate), I found the value, upon an average of all applications, to be 13d. a bushel, heaped measure; estimating which at 70lb. weight, the ton is £1. 14s.\" The following are the valuations of several gentlemen of the value of carrots in the way of fattening cattle:\n\n| Gentleman                  | Value per Ton |\n|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Mr Mellish of Blyth        | L. 1 0 0     |\n| Mr Stovin of Doncaster     |              |\n| Mr Moody of Ratford        |              |\n| Mr Taylor of Bifrons       |              |\n| Mr Le Grand of Ash         |              |\n| Sir John Hobby Mill of Bisham |          |\n| Mr Billingsley             |              |\n\nSome other gentlemen whom our author consulted, could not make their carrots worth anything: so that, on the whole, it appears a matter of the utmost doubt, if contradictory are the accounts, whether the culture of carrots be really attended with any profit or not. Thus Sir John Mill, by fattening hogs, makes £1. 6s. and Mr Stovin £1.; but others could not fatten hogs upon them at all; and some of Mr Young's neighbours told him, that carrots were good for nothing except to scour hogs to death. The experiment of Mr Le Grand upon wethers appeared to be made with the greatest accuracy; yet two circumstances seem to militate against it. 1. The sheep were put lean to them; whereas it is a fact well known, that if they are not half fat when put to turnips, no profit will result; and it is possible that the case may be the same with carrots. 2. He gave them also as much fine hay as they would eat.\n\nIn this uncertain state of the matter, the only thing New experiments can be done is to make a number of experiments with as much accuracy as possible, in order to ascertain the real value per ton: and our author endeavours to show, that there is no danger of losing much by experiments of this kind. \"I have shown (says he), that they are to be cultivated for 4l. per acre, left on the ground for sheep. Suppose the crop only two bushels at 70lb. each per rood, 320 per acre, or ten tons; it will readily be agreed, that such a produce is very low to calculate upon, since 20 tons are common among carrot-cultivators. It appears from Mr Le Grand's experiments, that a wether worth £1. 5s. eats 16lb. of carrots, and four pounds of hay per day: dropping the hay, and calculating for sheep of less than half that size (which are much more common), it will be perhaps an ample allowance to assign them 12lb. of carrots a day. If they are, as they ought to be, half fat when put up, they will be completely fattened in 100 days. At this rate, 20 wethers will, in 100 days, eat 11 tons, or very little more than one moderate acre. Now, let it be remembered, that it is a good acre of turnips which will fatten eight such wethers, the common Norfolk calculation;\nCulture of calculation: from which it appears, that one acre of carrots is, for this purpose, of more value than two of turnips. Further, let us suppose horses fed with them instead of oats: to top, cart, and pack up, 10 tons of carrots, I know may be done for £28.—An acre therefore (other expenses included) costs £5. Fifty pounds weight of carrots are an ample allowance for a horse a day: ten tons, at that rate, last three bottles for five months. But this £5 laid out in oats at 16s. per quarter, will purchase little more than six quarters; which will last three horses, at two bushels each per week, no more than two months; a most enormous inferiority to the carrots.”\n\nIn the same volume, p. 187, Mr Young gives an account of another experiment made by himself on the feeding of lambs with carrots. The quantities they eat varied excessively at different times; thirty-five of them consumed from five to ten bushels per day; but on an average, he rates them at four bushels of 50 pounds per day. In all, they consumed 407 bushels from November to April, when they were sold and killed fat. At putting upon the carrots, the lambs were valued only at £8l. but were sold in April at 25l. 4s.; so that the value of the carrots was exactly 7l. 4s. or about 4d. per bushel. This price he supposes to be sufficient to induce any one to attempt the culture of carrots, as thus he would have a clear profit of 40s. per acre; “which (says he) is greater than can attend the best wheat crops in this kingdom.” The land on which the carrots grew was sown next year with barley, and produced the clearest in the parish; which contradicts an assertion our author had heard, that carrots make land foul. The grass upon which the sheep were fed with the carrots, and which amounted to about an acre, was very little improved for the crop of hay in 1781, owing to the dryness of the season; but in 1782 was greatly superior to the rest of the field, and more improved in quantity: “for, instead of an indifferent vegetation, scattered thick with the centaurea scabiosa, filago, rhinanthus, crista galli, and linum catharticum, with other plants of little value, it encouraged a very beautiful sheet of the best plants that can appear in a meadow, viz. the lathyrus pratensis, achillea millefolium, trifolium repens, trifolium ochroleucum, trifolium alpestre, and the plantago lanceolata.\n\nIn the same volume of the Bath papers, p. 227, Mr Billingley gives an account of the comparative profit of carrots and cabbages. Of the former, however, he obtained only seven tons, 15 cwt. per acre; the cabbages produced 36 tons: nevertheless, according to him, the profit of the former was £1. 8s.; of the latter, only £1. 11s. In a paper on the culture of carrots by Mr Kirby of Ipswich, vol. iii. p. 84, he informs us, that he never determined the weight of an acre, but reckons the produce from 200 to 500 bushels; which, at 56lb. to the bushel, is from five to ten tons and a half.\n\nIn the same volume, p. 320, the Rev. Mr Onley seems to prefer the culture of carrots to potatoes. “However valuable (says he), from ease of culture, and greatness of produce to the poor, especially in all small spots, I doubt, unless near great towns, whether on a farming plan, potatoes be so eligible as other herbage or roots, especially as carrots, which I cannot but admire (for my trials are too trivial to venture bolder language), deserve every encouragement, even on soils hitherto thought too heavy for them.—I am from experience convinced, that an acre of carrots will double in the particular quantum, of equally hearty provender, the product of an acre of oats; and from the nature of their vegetation, the nice mode of cultivation, and even of taking them up (all of which, expensive as they are, bear a very inferior proportion to the value of a medium crop), must leave the land, especially if taken off it in an early period, so mellow for the plough, as to form a feed-bed for barley equal to any fallow-tilth.”\n\nMr Onley’s deputation was a substitute for oats to feed horses; of which great numbers are kept in his county (Exeter). Potatoes, he observes, are excellent for small pork, when baked or boiled, mixed with a little barley meal; but for large hogs, they are most profitably given raw, if they have at the same time the slack of the barn door in thrashing season, &c. In the fifth volume he resumes the subject, and acquaints us, that he applied a single acre in his bean field to the culture of carrots, which generally produced 400 bushels; and this he considers as a small produce. “I am, however, sensible (says he) that they will amply repay every expense of the finest culture; and should, from their extensive utility on found, deep, and friable land, be everywhere attempted. Some of my neighbours, who have been induced to try them on rather a larger scale, with finer culture, and freer soil, have raised from 600 to 900 bushels per acre, and applied them more profitably, as well as more generally, than any other winter herbage, to deer, sheep, bullocks, cows, and horses. At the lowest calculation, from our little superior to trials, they are computed to exceed turnips in value turnips and one-third, as to quantity of food; but are far superior to what arises from convenience for the stable; where to us they seem to be a substitute for corn to all horses, at least such as are not used in any quick work; and partially so with corn for those that are.”\n\nIn making a comparison between the profit on oats and carrots, Mr Onley found the latter exceed by no less than 2l. 1s. 8d. per acre. His method of cultivation is to sow them in March or April; to hoe them three times, harrowing after each hoeing. Sometimes he left them in the ground till after Christmas, taking them up as wanted; but afterwards he took them up in October, in dry days, putting them directly into small upright cocks of 10 bushels each, covered entirely, with the tops cut off.—Thus they appear to dry better than in any other way, and bear the weather with very little loss. If, after being thus dried, they are carried into any barn or shed, it will be better, if they are in large quantities, not to pack them close, on account of the danger of heating, but rather to throw them promiscuously into heaps, with a little straw over them. When perfectly dry, they do not in general require any washing, except for horses regularly kept in the stable.\n\nThis root has been found to generally valuable as a substitute for grain in feeding horses, that its use in that way is rapidly spreading into various parts of the country. By the quantity of saccharine matter which it contains, it is probably rendered extremely rich and stimulating to the stomach of that delicate animal, so that a less quantity of it goes to waste than of any other food. We may remark that the gentleman already mentioned, Mr Onley, who had the merit of pressing\nCulture of particular Plants.\n\nPressing upon the public attention the importance and utility of this root, mentions a use to which we believe it is not unfrequently applied in the dairy. \"In our dairies (says he) as many carrots are bruised before churning, as produce, squeezed through a cloth into as much cream as makes eight or ten pound of butter; an half pint of juice; this adds somewhat to the colour, richness, and flavour of winter butter; and we think, where hay is allowed besides, contributes much to counteracting the flavour from the feed of turnips. At present (our carrot feed being exhausted) from turnips and hay, with this juice, our butter is equal to that of the Epping dairies.\"\n\nWe may conclude by taking notice here of an advantageous mode of cultivating carrots by making use of them with a view to fit the ground in young plantations. It was adopted by Thomas Walford, Esq., of Birdbrooke, Essex, who gives the following account of it:—“It has been my constant practice for these last five years, wherever I make a plantation of firs, or deciduous trees, to sow the ground in the spring with carrots, which I have found not only pay part of my expences, and frequently the whole, but much more beneficial to the trees than any other method I had before adopted.\n\n“When I make a plantation of deciduous trees, the ground is dug two spits deep in October, and planted immediately, leaving it in that state until the middle or latter end of March, or beginning of April; then, if necessary, chop it over with a hoe, and sow my carrots; if for firs, I do not dig the ground until March, at which time I plant my trees, and sow the carrots, having found my crop more luxuriant and productive upon ground fresh dug than that which was dug in the autumn.—I give for digging 8d per rod; hoe only twice; the produce is generally four bushels of clean carrots, which I sell at 6d. per bushel, the buyer to fetch them from their place of growth.\n\n“The soil in some places, loose and hollow; the under stratum clay; in others a fine vegetable mould upon a red loam.\n\n“I find in taking up the carrots, less damage is done to the young fibres of the trees, than by digging between them; for, it is impossible with the greatest care of your servants, not to cut off some of them by digging, and thereby injure the trees, besides leaving the ground in no better state than it is after carrots; for when the carrot is drawn, the cavity is filled immediately with loose mould, through which the young fibres will strike with great freedom, and very much accelerate the growth of the trees.”\n\n4. Parsnips.\n\nParsnips have never in this country received from husbandmen the attention to which they are well entitled from the use with which they are cultivated, and the great quantity of saccharine or nourishing matter they are known to contain, which certainly abounds in them, in a much greater proportion than in almost any other vegetable with which we are at present acquainted.\n\nTo cultivate this root (says Mr Hazard) so as to make it advantageous to the farmer, it will be right to sow the seed in the autumn immediately after it is ripe; by which means the plants will appear early the following spring, and get strong before the weeds can rise to injure them. Neither the seeds nor young plants are ever materially injured by frosts; on which account, as well as many others, the autumn is preferable to the spring sowing. The best soil for them is Mr Hazard’s rich deep loam, and next to this sand. They will grow well in a black gritty soil, but not in stone, thod of culbrah, gravel, or clay; and they are always largest in the deepest earth. If the soil be proper, they do not require much manure. Mr Hazard obtained a very good crop for three years upon the same piece of ground without using any; but when he laid on about 40 cart loads of sand per acre upon a stiff loam, and ploughed it in, he found it answer very well; whence he concludes, that a mixture of soils may be proper for this root. The seed may be sown in drills at about 18 inches distance from one another, that the plants may be the more conveniently hand or horse hoed; and they will be more luxuriant if they undergo a second hoeing, and are carefully earthed, so as not to cover the leaves. Such as have not ground to spare, or cannot get it in proper condition in autumn, may at that time sow a plot in their garden, and transplant from thence in the latter end of April, or early in the month of May following. The plants must be carefully drawn, and the ground well pulverized by harrowing and rolling; after which a furrow should be opened with the plough, about six or eight inches deep, in which the plants should be regularly laid at the distance of about ten inches from each other, taking care not to let the root be bent, but for the plant to stand perpendicular after the earth is closed about it, which ought to be done immediately by means of persons who should for this purpose follow the planter with a hoe. Another furrow must be opened about 18 inches from the former, in the same direction, and planted as before; and so on in like manner until all the plants are deposited, or the field be completely cropped; and when the weeds appear, hoeing will be necessary, and it will afterwards be proper to earth them; but if the leaves of the plants be covered with earth, the roots will be injured. Parsnips ought not to be planted by dibbling, as the ground thus becomes too bound, as seldom to admit the small lateral fibres with which these roots abound to fix in the earth, by which they are prevented from expanding themselves, and never attain a proper size. When circumstances are properly attended to, there is little doubt that a crop of parsnips would answer much better than a crop of carrots. They are equal, if not superior, in fattening pigs, as they make their flesh whiter, and the animals themselves are more fond of these roots than of carrots. Horses eat them greedily when clean washed and sliced among bran, and thrive very well upon them; and black cattle are said likewise to approve of them.\n\nThough parsnips are little used in Britain, they are highly esteemed in France. In Brittany they are thought, as food for cattle, to be little inferior to wheat; and cows fed with them are said to give as much milk, and of as good quality, as in the summer months. In the island of Jersey they have long been considered as of the highest importance; and as the mode of cultivating them there seems worthy of attention, we shall here give an account of it, from a paper transmitted by...\nCulture of the Agricultural Society of Jersey to the British Board of Agriculture.\n\n\"It is impossible, say these gentlemen, to trace the period when the cultivation of this plant was first introduced amongst us. It has been known for several centuries, and the inhabitants have reaped such benefit therefrom, that, for fattening their cattle and pigs, they prefer it to all the known roots of both hemispheres. The cattle fed therewith yield a juicy and exquisite meat. The pork and beef of Jersey are incontestably equal, if not superior, to the best in Europe. We have observed, that the beef in summer is not equal to that in the autumn, winter, and spring periods, when the cattle are fed with parsnips; which we attribute to the excellency of that root.\n\n\"All animals eat it with avidity, and in preference to potatoes. We are ignorant of the reason, having never made any analysis of the parsnip. It would be curious, interesting, and useful, to investigate its characteristic principles: it is certain that animals are more fond of it than of any other root, and fatten more quickly. The parsnip possesses, without doubt, more nutritious juices than the potato. It has been proved that the latter contains eleven ounces and a half of water, and one gros of earthy substance, French weight; therefore, there only remain four ounces and five gros of nutritive matter. Probably the parsnip does not contain so much watery particles; nevertheless, they digest very easily in the animal's body. The cows fed with hay and parsnips during winter yield butter of a fine yellow hue, of a saffron tinge, as excellent as if they had been in the most luxuriant pasture.\"\n\nThese gentlemen proceed to state, that, in the island of Jersey, parsnips are not cultivated alone, but along with beans, among which last pease are sometimes mixed. There are three modes of cultivation: 1st, With the spade; 2nd, With the plough and spade; and 3rd, With two ploughs, the one called the small and the other the great plough. This last method, as being the most economical and advantageous to the husbandman, is the only one described. In the month of September, a flight ploughing and preparation is sometimes given to the field destined for beans and parsnips in the ensuing year; but more generally the whole work is performed in high grounds about the middle of February, and in the middle of March in low land. A light plough cuts and turns the earth about four or five inches deep; then follows it a large plough constructed on purpose, and only used for this operation, which elevates the earth on the furrow laid open, and turns it over that which the small plough turned up. The essential point is to plough deep and to cover the clods over again.\n\nThe field thus prepared, is suffered to remain 15 days, after which it is very lightly harrowed. On the same day, or on the ensuing, the beans are planted in the following manner. Straight lines must be drawn from north to south with a gardeners rake at 4 feet distance. On these straight lines, 19 inches in breadth, women plant four or five beans in rows 4 inches distant from each other, or the beans are planted in double rows all over the field, at the usual depth, and 12 feet distance from each other, with the beans spaced out 18 inches from each other. When all this is done, the parsnips are sown in broad-cast over the field, after which it is well harrowed. In 15 days after, if the weather has been warm and rainy, or in three weeks if it has been cold and dry, the ground is harrowed again to cut up the weeds. In five or six weeks the beans shoot out, and the ground soon appears as if covered by hedges or laid out in paths for walking; for in the spaces between the lines where the beans were planted are as many alleys, where women and children weed with great facility. They generally weed the ground twice, and the operation is performed with a two-pronged fork, such as is used in gardens. The first weeding is performed at the end of April or beginning of May, when the plants must be cleared out if they are too thick. When the beans are ripe, which is in August or September, they are immediately plucked up, not to inconvenience the parsnips. The crop of beans is not always certain. If high winds or fogs prevail when they are in flower, the produce will be scanty; but the parsnips in a manner never fail. They neither dread the inclemency of the weather, nor are affected by the hardest frost, nor by any of those accidents which at times will instantly destroy a whole crop.\n\nParsnips grow till the end of September, but some give them to cattle they wish to fatten in the beginning of September. The people of these islands consider the parsnip as the most juicy and nutritious of all roots known. Its cultivation is an excellent preparation for wheat, which is sown there without manure after parsnips, and yields a plentiful crop. It must be observed, that though this cultivation of parsnips is expensive where the price of labour is high, no dung or manure is necessary either for the parsnips or the wheat. They reckon 30 perches of parsnips, with a little hay, will fatten an ox of three or four years old, though ever so lean; he eats them in the course of three months as follows: they are given at six in the morning, at noon, and at eight at night, in rations of 40lb. each; the largest are slit into three or four pieces; but not walked unless very much covered with earth. In the intermediate hours, at nine in the morning, two in the afternoon, and nine at night, a little hay is given. Experience has shown, that when cattle, pigs, or poultry, are fed with parsnips, they are sooner fattened and are more bulky than with any other root or vegetable whatever. The meat of such is most delicate and savoury. In spring the markets are furnished with the best and fattest beef from their feeding on parsnips. The crops of parsnips raised in Jersey and Guernsey are very great. On an extent of 1000 feet, the produce of a field of beans and parsnips is about 1200lb. weight of parsnips, Rouen measure, and thirty cabots or half bushels of beans, and three cabots and a half of pease; which altogether, according to the price at which these articles are actually sold there, amount to the sum of 256 livres French currency. The following information was also received from the president of the Jersey Society on 1st March 1796, viz. \"Since writing concerning the crop of beans and parsnips together, we have found that an individual who cultivates parsnips without sowing either pease or beans along with them had a crop of 14,760lb. weight Rouen measure per vergee.\" The vergee is 40 perches in length and one perch in breadth.\n\nIII. Plants\nIII. Plants cultivated for Leaves, or for both Leaves and Root.\n\n1. Turnip-rooted Cabbage.\n\nThis plant may deservedly be reckoned next in value to the turnip itself. Its advantages, according to Sir Thomas Beevor, are, \"that it affords food for cattle late in the spring, and resists mildew and frost, which sometimes destroy the common turnip;\" whence he is of opinion that every farmer who cultivates the common turnip should always have part of his farm laid out in the cultivation of this root. The importance and value of turnip-rooted cabbages seem only to have been lately ascertained. In the Bath Society papers we have the following account of Sir Thomas Beevor's method of cultivating them; which from experience he found to be cheaper and better than any other.\n\n\"In the first or second week of June, I sow the same quantity of seed, hoe the plants at the same size, leave them at the same distance from each other, and treat them in all respects like the common turnip. In this method I have always obtained a plentiful crop of them; to ascertain the value of which I need only inform you, that on the 23rd day of April last, having then two acres left of my crop, found, and in great perfection, I divided them by fold hurdles into three parts of nearly equal dimensions. Into the first part I put 24 small bullocks of about 30 stone weight each (14lb. to the stone), and 30 middle-sized fat wethers, which, at the end of the first week, after they had eaten down the greater part of the leaves, and some part of the roots, I shifted into the second division, and then put 70 lean sheep into what was left of the first; these fed off the remainder of the turnips left by the fat stock; and so they were shifted through the three divisions, the lean flock following the fat as they wanted food, until the whole was consumed.\n\n\"The 24 bullocks and 30 fat wethers continued in the turnips until the 21st of May, being exactly four weeks; and the 70 lean sheep until the 29th, which is one day over four weeks; so that the two acres kept me 24 small bullocks and 110 sheep four weeks (not reckoning the overplus day of keeping the lean sheep); the value, at the rate of keeping at that season, cannot be estimated in any common year at less than 4d. a-week for each sheep, and 1s. 6d. per week for each bullock, which would amount together to the sum of £4l. 10s. 8d. for the two acres.\n\n\"You will hardly, I conceive, think I have fet the price of keeping the flock at too high a rate; it is beneath the price here in almost every spring, and in this last it would have cost double, could it have been procured; which was so far from being the case, that hundreds of sheep and lambs here were lost, and the rest greatly pinched, for want of food.\n\n\"You will observe, gentlemen, that in the valuation of the crop above mentioned I have claimed no allowance for the great benefit the farmer receives by being enabled to fatten his grass to get into a forward growth, nor for the superior quality of these turnips in fattening his stock; both which circumstances must stamp a new and a great additional value upon them. But as their continuance on the land may seem to be injurious to the succeeding crop, and indeed will deprive the farmer totally of either oats or barley; so to supply that loss I have always sown buck-wheat on the first earth upon the land from which the turnips were thus fed off; allowing one bushel of seed per acre, for which I commonly receive from five to six quarters per acre in return. And that I may not throw that part of my land out of the same course of tillage with the rest, I sow my clover or other grass seeds with the buck-wheat, in the same manner as with the oat or barley crops, and have always found as good a layer (ley) of it afterwards.\n\n\"Thus you see, that in providing a most incomparable vegetable food for cattle, in that season of the year in which the farmer is generally most distressed, and his cattle almost starved, a considerable profit may likewise be obtained, much beyond what is usually derived from his former practice, by the great produce and price of a crop raised at so easy an expense as that of buck-wheat, which with us sells commonly at the same price as barley, oftentimes more, and but very rarely for less.\n\n\"The land on which I have usually sown turnip-rooted cabbages is a dry mixed soil, worth 1s. per acre.\"\n\nTo the preceding account the Society have subjoined the following note: \"Whether we regard the importance of the subject, or the clear and practical information which the foregoing letter conveys, it may be considered as truly interesting as any we have ever been favoured with: and therefore it is recommended Recommended in the strongest manner to farmers in general, that they adopt a mode of practice so decidedly ascertained to be by the Bath Society in a high degree judicious and profitable.\"\n\nTo raise the turnip-rooted cabbage for transplanting, the best method yet discovered is, to breast-plough and burn as much old pasture as may be judged necessary for the seed bed; two perches well stocked with plants will be sufficient to plant an acre. The land should be dug as shallow as possible, turning the ashes in; and the seed should be sown the beginning of April.\n\nThe land intended for the plantation to be cultivated and dugged as for the common turnip. About mid-summer (or sooner if the weather will permit) will be a proper time for planting, which is best done in the following manner: the land to be thrown into one-boutting ridges, upon the tops of which the plants are to be set, at about 18 inches distance from each other. As soon as the weeds rise, give a hand-hoeing; afterwards run the ploughs in the intervals, and fetch a furrow from each ridge, which, after laying a fortnight or three weeks, is again thrown back to the ridges; if the weeds rise again, it is necessary to give them another hand-hoeing.\n\nIf the young plants in the seed-bed should be attacked by the fly, sow wood-ashes over them when the dew is on, which will effectually prevent the ravages they would otherwise make.\n\nIn another letter from Sir Thomas Beevor, Bath Papers, vol. viii. p. 489, he expresses his hope that the turnip-rooted cabbages he had would last until he should have plenty of grass for all his stock. To make a comparative estimation of the quantity of food yielded by the turnip-rooted cabbage and the common turnip, he selected some of each kind, and having girdled common them with as much accuracy as possible; he found, that turnip.\nA turnip-rooted cabbage of 18 inches circumference weighed 5 lb., and a common turnip of the same size only 3½ lb.; on trying others, the general result was found to be in that proportion. Had they been weighed with the tops, the superiority of the turnip-rooted cabbage would have been greater, the tops of them being remarkably bulky. They were weighed in the month of March; but had this been done at Christmas, our author is of opinion that the difference would not have been so great; though he reckons this very circumstance of their continuing so long to afford a nourishing food, an influence of their excellency above almost every other vegetable whatever.\n\nIn the fourth volume of the same work, Sir Thomas gives an account of another experiment on five acres of turnip-rooted cabbage, four of which were eaten upon the field, the other was pulled up and carried to the stables and ox-houses. They were sown and cultivated as other turnips; the beasts were put to them on the 12th of April, and continued feeding upon them till the 11th of May. The cattle fed for this space of time were, 12 Scotch bullocks weighing 40 stone each; eight homebreds, two years old; fifteen cows full sized; 40 sheep; 18 horses; besides 40 store-hogs and pigs, which lived upon the broken pieces and offal, without any other allowance, for the whole four weeks. The whole value of the plant, exclusive of the feeding of the pigs, amounted, according to our author's calculation, to £18l.; and he says that the farmers would willingly give this sum in the spring for feeding as many cattle: \"because it enables them to save the young shooting grafts (which is so frequently injured by the tread of the cattle in the frothy nights) until it gets to such a length and thickness as to be afterwards but little affected by the summer's drought. Besides this, the tops or leaves are in the spring much more abundant, and much better food than those of the common turnip, as already observed; and they continue in full perfection after all the common turnips are rotten or worthless.\n\nThe disadvantages attending the cultivation of turnip-rooted cabbages are, that they require a great deal of time and pains to take them up out of the ground, if they are to be carried off the field; and if fed where they grow, it requires almost an equal labour to take up the pieces left by the cattle. A great deal of earth is also taken up along with the root; and the substance of the latter is so firm and solid, that they must be cut in two in order to enable the cattle to eat them. To obviate some of these objections, it will be proper to sow the plants on rich and very light land; and as they are longer in coming to the hoe than the common turnip, it will be proper to sow them about the beginning of June.\n\nIn another experiment upon this plant by the same gentleman, the cabbages held out during the long and severe frost of 1788 without the least injury, though it destroyed three-fourths of all the common turnips in the neighbourhood. On the 21st of April 1789, the average produce of an acre was found to be somewhat more than 24½ tons, though the tops had not sprouted above three inches. Considering the precariousness of turnips and other crops, Sir Thomas is decidedly of opinion, that all farmers ought to have as many turnip-rooted cabbages as would afford and endure them a full provision for their cattle for about three or four weeks during the latter part of the spring. This quantity he reckons sufficient, as the consumption, particularly when drawn and carried off the land, is attended with more trouble and expense than that of common turnips, especially if the soil be wet and heavy. In another letter, dated May 3, 1790, Sir Thomas Beever once more sets forth the advantages of having a crop of these vegetables during the spring season. \"In consequence (says he) of the very cold weather we have had here, the grass is but just springing; as the turnips are wholly eaten up, it occasions much distress among the farmers for want of some green vegetable food for their sheep and cattle; whereas, by the affluence of my turnip-rooted cabbages, I have abundance of the best and most nutritious food that can be found there.\" He then proceeds to recommend their culture \"for the support of almost all live stock for the three last weeks of April, or first week of May, when the grass shoots late.\"\n\nIn the 4th volume of the Transactions of the Society for encouraging Arts, Mr. Robins, who received a premium for raising the greatest quantity of this plant, informs us, that the soil on which it grew was a fine braith, inclining to sand, not worth more than £10 per acre; the preparation the same as for turnips. The manure was a compost of earth and dung, which he finds to answer better than dung. The seed was sown about the beginning of April on a clean spot of ground; and he commonly uses an old pasture where the sheep-fold has been in the winter, after taking away the dung, and digging it very shallow; \"as the roots of the young plants (says he) might soon reach the dung or salts, which must consequently be left, in order to force them out of the fly's way.\" These insects, our author observes, are extremely fond of the turnip-rooted cabbage; much more so, he believes, than of common turnips. About the middle of June they should be planted out upon one-bout ridges raised by a double plough made for the purpose. Seven thousand plants are sufficient for one acre; but if only six are used, the roots will be the larger.\n\nTo determine how many sheep might be kept upon an acre of turnip-rooted cabbage, our author shut up sheep fed 200 ewes with their lambs upon a piece of poor pasture by an acre of turnip-rooted cabbages. One ton was found sufficient for keeping them in sufficient health for a day. On giving them a larger piece of ground to run over, though it had been eaten all winter and late in the spring, yet, with this trifling affluence, 13 tons of turnip-cabbage were made to serve 18 days; at the end of which the ewes and lambs were found very much improved, which could not have been expected from four acres of turnips in the month of April, the time that these were fed.\n\nFrom some trials made on the turnip-rooted cabbage at Cullen House in the north of Scotland, it appears that the plant is adapted to the climate of every part of our island. The first trial was made in the year 1784. The seeds were sown about the middle of March in garden ground properly prepared. The cabbages were transplanted about the middle of March that year into a dry light soil, well cleaned and dugged with rotten cow-dung, in rows three feet distant from each other, and at the distance of 20 inches in the\nCulture of the rows. They were kept very clean, and the earth particular was hoed up to the roots of the plants; by which means they were probably prevented from attaining the hardness they would otherwise have arrived at; though, after all, it was necessary to cut the roots in two before the sheep could eat them. When thus cut, the animals ate them greedily, and even preferred them to every other food. The roots continued good for at least a month after the common turnips were unfit for use: some of them weighed from eight to ten pounds, and a few of them more. Other trials have since been made; and it now appears that the plant will thrive very well with the ordinary culture of turnips in the open fields, and in the usual manner of sowing broad-cast. From a comparative trial made by the earl of Fife upon this root with some others, the quantities produced upon 100 square yards of ground were as follows:\n\n| Common turnips | stone. lb. |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| Turnip-rooted cabbage | 92 4 |\n| Carrots | 88 0 |\n| Root of scarcity | 77 0 |\n\nThe turnip-rooted cabbage was planted in lines 20 inches asunder; the common turnips sown broad-cast, and hand-weeded, so that they came up very thick, being not more than three or four inches asunder when full grown. Two cows were fed for six weeks with the turnips, two with the turnip-rooted cabbage, and two with the root of scarcity for an equal time: the two fed with turnips gave most milk, and those with the root of scarcity the least. His lordship observes, however, that carrots thrive better on his farm than any other crop: that his horses had been fed on them at the rate of two pecks a-day, with no corn, and little more than half the usual quantity of hay. \"They were kept at work every day from seven to eight hours, and were never in better order.\"\n\n2. Swedish Turnip, or Roota Baga.\n\nThe roota baga, or Swedish turnip, is a plant from which great expectations have been formed. It is said to be hardier than the common turnip, and of greater sweetness and solidity. It also preserves its freshness and succulence till a very late period of its growth, even after it has produced seed; on account of which property it has been recommended to the notice of farmers as an excellent kind of succulent food for domestic animals in the spring of the year, when common turnips and most other winter crops have failed, and before grass has got up to furnish an abundant bite for feeding beasts. This peculiarity, so valuable, yet so singular as to have led many at first to doubt the fact, seems to be sufficiently ascertained by experiment. Dr. *The Bot., J. Anderlon* in particular informs us, that it \"begins to send out its flower-stems in the spring, nearly about the same time with the common turnip; but that the root, in consequence of that change of state, suffers very little alteration. I continued to use these turnips at my table every day till towards the middle of May; and had I never gone into the garden myself, I should not even then have suspected, from the taste or appearance of the bulb itself, that it had been shot at all. The stems, however, at the season I gave over using them, were from four to five feet high, and in full flower. I should have continued the experiment longer, had not the quantity I had left for that purpose been exhausted, and a few only left for seed.\n\n\"This experiment, however, fully proves, that this kind of turnip may be employed as a succulent food for cattle till the middle of May at least, in an ordinary year; and I have not the smallest doubt but it will continue perfectly good for that purpose till the end of May in any season; at which time grass and other spring crops can easily be had for bringing beasts forward in flesh. I can therefore, without hesitation, recommend this plant to the farmer as a most valuable spring feeding for cattle and sheep; and for this purpose, I think no wise farmer should be without a proportion of this kind of turnip to succeed the other sorts after they fail. The profitable method of consuming it, where it is to be kept very late, is, I am convinced, to cut off the tops with a scythe or sickle when from one foot to eighteen inches high, to induce it to send out fresh stems, that will continue soft and succulent to the end; whereas, without this process, the stems would become sticky and useless.\n\n\"I cannot, however, recommend this kind of turnip, from what I have yet seen, as a general crop; because I think it probable, that unless in particular circumstances, the common field turnips grow to a much larger size, and afford upon the whole a more weighty crop. These, therefore, should still continue to be cultivated for winter use, the other being reserved only for spring consumption.\n\n\"Experiments are still wanting to ascertain with certainty the peculiar soil and culture that best agree with this plant; but from the few observations I have hitherto had an opportunity of making upon it, it seems to me probable, that it thrives better, and grows to a larger size on damp clayey soil, than on light sandy land. But I would not wish to be understood as here speaking positively; I merely throw it out as a hint for future observation: on spongey soil it prospers.\n\n\"Though the uses of this as a garden plant are of much smaller consequence than those above specified, it may not be improper to remark, that its leaves form a very sweet kind of greens at any time; and merely for the sake of the experiment, I caused some of these to be picked off the stems of the plants coming to feed, on the 4th of June, the king's birthday, which, on being readied, were found perfectly sweet, without the smallest tendency to bitterness, which most, if not all, other kinds of greens that have been hitherto cultivated are known to acquire after their stems are considerably advanced; no family, therefore, can ever be at a loss for greens when they have any of this plant in feed.\n\n\"A root of this kind of turnip was taken up this day (June 15); the feed-stalks were firm and woody, the pods full formed, and in some of them the seeds were nearly ripe. The root, however, was as soft and succulent as at any former period of its growth; nor was the skin, as I expected, hard or woody. It was made ready and brought to the table: some persons there thought the taste as good, if not better, than at any former period of its growth; but I myself, perhaps through prejudice, thought it had not quite so high a relish as in winter: At any rate, however, there\nCulture of the roota baga in Nottinghamshire.\n\nThis vegetable, from its obvious utility, is gradually coming to be much used in various quarters of the island. In the Agricultural Survey of Nottinghamshire, the following description of the modes in which it has been successfully cultivated, is well worthy of attention. \"The roota baga, or Swedish turnip, is now cultivated by a few farmers in this district. It appears to be superior to the common turnip in many respects, particularly in hardiness, as it stood the last severe winter without the least injury. It is eaten with greediness by all animals, from the horse to the swine. Sheep prefer it to all others; but the material advantage that has been made of it, is the substituting it for corn in the food of draught horses; in which it has been found to answer the wish of every person who has yet tried it. The turnips are put into a tub or barrel, and cut small with an instrument like a hoe, with the blade put perpendicularly into the shaft; a man will cut in one hour as much as six horses can eat in twenty-four. The tops and bottoms are previously cut off and given to the pigs. Horses that are hard worked, look full as well when fed with this turnip and very little hay, as they formerly did when very high fed with corn. The Swedish turnip should be sowed early, from the 15th of May to the 10th of June.\"—The following information on the culture of the roota baga, is given in the same Survey upon the authority of J. Daiken, Esq. of Nottingham.\n\nMr Daiken, about the 10th of May 1794, sowed about four acres with the seed of roota baga, about 2 lbs. per acre, on good land land, worth 20s. an acre, manured as for turnips, and having been ploughed four or five times; the rest of the field, to the amount of nine acres in all, with common turnip and turnip-rooted cabbage, all broad-cast. They were not transplanted, but hoed out nine inches asunder, at three hoeings, at 7s. 6d. an acre; no other culture. In November, began to use them for horses, giving at first clover and rye-grass hay, oats and beans; but finding that the horses did well upon them, left off all corn, and continued them on hay and the roots only; fifteen were thus fed for about two months, were constantly hard worked, and preserved themselves in very good condition. Mr Daiken is so well convinced, that in this application they were worth 30l. an acre, that he would in future, if he could not get them otherwise, rather give that sum per acre for one or two acres, than not have them for this use. They lost their leaves entirely when the frosts set in; but the roots were not the least affected, though the common turnips in the same field were totally destroyed. Palfengers passing through the field, cut holes in them, which did not let the frosts injure them; nor were those hurt which were damaged by cattle biting them. Some came to the weight of 16 lbs. and Mr Daiken thinks the average of the crop 8 lbs. and much to exceed in tonnage per acre common turnips.\n\nMr Daiken gave them also to hogs, cattle and sheep. They are excellent for hogs; and sheep being let into the field before the common turnips were destroyed, gave so decided a preference to the roota baga, that they would not settle on the common turnips while the others were to be had.\n\nThe method of giving them to horses is to cut off the top-root, to with them, and to cut them roughly with a perpendicular hoe, and then given directly, without keeping them to dry. The horses ate them with avidity, and seemed even to prefer them to corn. Their qualities appear to be singular, as they bind horses instead of relaxing them as other roots do. One mare was kept entirely upon them and straw, worked every day, did well, and never looked better; this mare was more bound by them than the reit. They have a strong effect upon making the coats fine; and one or two affected by the grease, were cured by them, as they act as a strong diuretic. In this mode of application, one acre maintained fifteen about two months; and Mr Daiken is so well convinced of the utility of the plant, as well as many of his neighbours, that he intends, and they also, to increase the cultivation much.\n\nMr Daiken suspects there are two sorts of the roota baga, because some, upon cutting, are white within, but in general yellow; otherwise of the same external appearance. The yellow is the best.\n\n3. Turnip Cabbage.\n\nThis plant is as yet but little known. The seed is said to have been brought from the Cape of Good Hope by Mr Hatting, where it is very common as well as in Holland. It has also had an existence in Britain for many years, though not generally known. It has a much greater affinity to the cabbage than to the turnip; and is very hardy, bearing the winter as well, if not better, than common broccoli, and may therefore be considered as a valuable acquisition to the kitchen garden as well as for cattle. The best time Method of for sowing it for the garden is the end of May or beginning of June, though none of the plants have ever been observed to run to feed though sown even too early. Even though sown in August at the cauliflower season, the greater part stood throughout the following summer, and did not feed till the second spring. The plants require nearly the same management with broccoli as to distance, transplanting, &c., and are usually most esteemed when young, and about the size of a moderate garden turnip; those sown in June will continue all winter. The bulb must be stripped clean of its thick fibrous rind; after which it may be used as a common turnip. The crown or sprout is very good, but especially in the spring, when they begin to run to feed. Mr Broughton, from whose account in the Bath Papers, vol. v. this article is taken, thinks that the turnip-cabbage is more nutritious than the common turnip. The largest bulb he measured was 23 inches circumference; but the thickness of the rind is so great, that some farmers imagined that the bulb would be too hard for sheep. The objection, however, was obviated by Mr Broughton, who gave some of the oldest and toughest bulbs to his sheep, and found that they not only penetrated through the rind, but even devoured the greatest part of it.\n\n4. Cabbage.\n\nThe cabbage has been recommended by long experience.\nCulture of rience as an excellent food for cattle. Its uses as part of human food are also well known. It is therefore an interesting article in husbandry. It is easily raised, subject to few diseases, resists frosts more than turnip, is palatable to cattle, and sooner fills them than turnip, carrot, or potatoes.\n\nThe season for setting cabbage depends on the use it is intended for. If intended for feeding in November, December, and January, plants procured from seed sown the end of July the preceding year must be set in March or April. If intended for feeding in March, April, and May, the plants must be set the first week of the preceding July, from seed sown in the end of February or beginning of March the same year. The late setting of the plants retards their growth; by which means they have a vigorous growth the following spring. And this crop makes an important link in the chain that connects winter and summer green food. Where cabbage for spring food happens to be neglected, a few acres of rye, sown at Michaelmas, will supply the want. After the rye is consumed, there is time sufficient to prepare the ground for turnip.\n\nAnd now to prepare a field for cabbage. Where the plants are to be set in March, the field must be made up after harvest in ridges three feet wide. In that form let it lie all winter, to be mellowed with air and frost. In March, take the first opportunity, between wet and dry, to lay dung in the furrows. Cover the dung with a plough, which will convert the furrow into a crown, and consequently the crown into a furrow. Set the plants upon the dung, distant from each other three feet. Plant them so as to make a straight line across the ridges, as well as along the furrows, to which a gardener's line stretched perpendicularly across the furrows will be requisite. This will set each plant at the distance precisely of three feet from the plants that surround it. The purpose of this accuracy is to give opportunity for ploughing not only along the ridges, but across them. This mode is attended with three signal advantages: it saves hand-hoeing, it is a more complete dressing to the soil, and it lays earth neatly round every plant.\n\nIf the soil be deep and composed of good earth, a trench ploughing after the preceding crop will not be amiss; in which case, the time for dividing the field into three-feet ridges, as above, ought to be immediately before the digging for the plants.\n\nIf weeds happen to rise so close to the plants as not to be reached by the plough, it will require very little labour to destroy them with a hand-hoe.\n\nUnless the soil be much infested with annuals, twice ploughing after the plants are set will be a sufficient dressing. The first removes the earth from the plants; the next, at the distance of a month or so, lays it back.\n\nWhere the plants are to be set in July, the field must be ridged as directed for barley. It ought to have a slight ploughing in June before the planting, in order to loosen the soil, but not so as to bury the surface-earth; after which the three-feet ridges must be formed, and the other particulars carried on as directed above with respect to plants that are to be set in March.\n\nIn a paper already quoted from those of the Bath Society, Scots cabbages are compared, as to their utility in feeding cattle, with turnips, turnip-rooted cabbage, and carrots. In this trial the cabbages stand particular next in value to the carrots; and they are recommended as not liable to be affected by frost, if they be of the true flat-topped firm kind. Fifty-four tons have been raised upon an acre of ground not worth Quantity more than 12 shillings. There is likewise an advantage attending the feeding of cattle with cabbages, viz., that their dung is more in proportion than when fed with turnips or with hay; the former going off more by urine, and the latter having too little moisture. They also impoverish the ground much less than grain. Mr Billingfley accounts 46 tons per acre a greater crop than he ever read of; but Mr Vagg, in the fourth volume of Bath Papers, gives an account of a crop for which he received a premium from the Society, which was much superior to that of Mr Billingfley. Its extent was 12 acres; the produce of the worst was 42, and of the best 68 tons. They were manured with a compost of lime, weeds, and earth, that lay under the hedges round the field, and a layer of dung, all mixed and turned together. About 25 cart loads of this were spread upon an acre with the usual ploughing given to a common summer fallow; but for this, he says, \"admitting such crop to exhaust the manure in some degree by its growth, an ample restoration will be made by its refuse ploughed in, and by the stirring and cleaning of the ground.\" The whole expense of an acre, exclusive of the rent, according to Mr Vagg's calculation, amounts to £1. 14s. 1d. only four ounces of feed being requisite for an acre. The 12 acres, producing as above mentioned, would feed 45 oxen, and upwards of 60 sheep, for three months; improving them as much as the grass in the best months of the year, May, June, and July. He recommends sowing the seed about the middle of August, and transplanting the young cabbages where they may be sheltered from the frost; and to the neglect of this he ascribes the partial failure, or at least inferiority of one part of his ground in the crop just mentioned, the young plants not being removed till near midsummer, and then in too dry a time, that they were almost scorched up.\n\nIn the Farmer's Magazine, vol. ii. p. 217, we have of water several pertinent remarks upon the culture of this useful plant, particularly with regard to watering. \"It is a rule (says this correspondent) never to water the plants, let the season be as dry as it may; insinuating that it is entirely useless. If the land is in fine tilth and well dugged, this may be right, as the expense must be considerable; but it is probable, in very dry seasons, when the new set plants have nothing but a burning sun on them, that watering would have vast numbers, and might very well answer the expense, if a pond is near, and the work done with a water-cart.\" He takes notice also of another use of cabbages, which has not met with the attention it merits, viz., the planting of lands where turnips have failed. A late sown crop of these seldom turns to any account; but cabbages planted on the ground without any ploughing would prove very beneficial for sheep late in the spring; in all probability (unless on light, sandy, or limestone soils) of greater value than the turnips, had they succeeded.\n\nMr Marshall observes, that in the midland district, a valuable\nCulture of valuable sort of large green cabbage \"is propagated, if not raised,\" by Mr Bakewell, who is not more celebrated for his breed of rams than for his breed of cabbages. Great care is observed here in raising the seed, being careful to suffer no other variety of the brassica tribe to blow near seed cabbages; by which means they are kept true to their kind. To this end, it is said that some plant them in a piece of wheat; a good method, provided the seed in that situation can be preserved from birds.\"\n\nThe advantage of having large cabbages is that of being able to plant them wide enough from each other, to admit of their being cleaned with the plough, and yet to afford a full crop. The proper distance depends in some measure on the natural size of the species and the strength of the soil; the thinner they stand, the larger they will grow: but our author is of opinion that cabbages, as well as turnips, are frequently set out too thin. Four feet by two and a half, according to Mr Marshall, are a full distance for large cabbages on a rich soil.\n\nWe think it of importance to take notice of the following mode of transplanting cabbages, or earthing them, as being consistent with the best mode of practice, and coming from the most respectable practical authority, Mr George Cully of Fenton. \"We plant the cabbages, says he, not only in right lines but equidistant every way, so that we can plough between the rows, both long-ways and cross-ways; which, by loosening the earth to effectually on all sides, very much promotes their growth. But the matter I wished to inform you of, is the taking them up by the roots in the autumn whenever they have completed their growth, and putting them into the nearest stubble field you have, where a plough is ready to draw a straight furrow in the most convenient place; and at twenty yards distance, more or less, the ploughman makes another furrow parallel to the first. The cabbages are now turned out of the carts as conveniently as may be for a sufficient number of women to lay them along these furrows as close one to another as possible. The ploughman begins again where he first started, and turns a large furrow upon the cabbages which is trodden down and righted by one, two, or more as occasion requires, with each a spade in his hand to afflit where the plough has by chance or accident not thrown earth enough. Thus the work goes on till all is finished.\"\n\n\"We think we derive two advantages by the above process. In the first place, the cabbages keep sufficiently well through the winter in their new situation, while they do not draw or exhaust the land to much where they were growing: and, secondly, that land is at liberty to be sown with wheat as soon as cleared of the cabbages; which grain, in general, answers well after that green crop.\"\n\nCabbages and greens in general are apt to be infested by caterpillars. They may usually however be protected against those vermin by pulling off the large undermost leaves, which may be given to cows in the month of August, or when the common white butterflies begin to appear in numbers. These butterflies lay their eggs, which produce the cabbage caterpillar, on the under side of the largest leaves of the cabbage plants. There is also said to be another remedy. It consists of sowing beans among the cabbages, which will greatly prevent the breeding of these worms; for it is said that the butterflies have an antipathy to the flavour of beans.\n\n5. The Root of Scarcity.\n\nThe racine de défeté, or root of scarcity (Betula), delights in a rich loamy land well dugged. It is the root directed to be sown in rows, or broad-cast, and as soon as the plants are of the size of a goose quill, to be transplanted in rows of 18 inches distance, and 18 inches apart, one plant from the other: care must be taken in the sowing, to sow very thin, and to cover the seed, which lies in the ground about a month, an inch only. In transplanting, the root is not to be shortened, but the leaves cut at the top; the plant is then to be planted with a setting stick, so that the upper part of the root shall appear about half an inch out of the ground: this last precaution is very necessary to be attended to. These plants will strike root in twenty-four hours, and a man a little accustomed to planting will plant with ease 1800 or 2000 a day. In the seed-bed, the plants, like all others, must be kept clear of weeds: when they are planted out, after once hoeing, they will take care of themselves, and suffocate every kind of weed near them.\n\nThe best time to sow the seed is from the beginning of March to the middle of April: it is, however, advised to continue sowing every month until the beginning of July, in order to have a succession of plants. Both leaves and roots have been extolled as excellent both for man and beast. This plant is said not to be liable, like the turnip, to be destroyed by insects; for no insect touches it, nor is it affected by excessive drought, or the changes of seasons. Horned cattle, horses, pigs, and poultry, are exceedingly fond of it when cut small. The leaves may be gathered every 12 or 15 days; they are from 30 to 40 inches long, by 22 to 25 inches broad. This plant is excellent for milch cows, when given to them in proper proportions, as it adds much to the quality as well as quantity of their milk; but care must be taken to proportion the leaves with other green food, otherwise it would abate the milk, and fatten them too much, it being of exceeding a fattening quality. To put all these properties beyond doubt, however, further experiments are wanting.\n\nSect. IV. Culture of Grasfs.\n\nThe latter end of August, or the beginning of September, is the best season for sowing grasfs seeds, as down fields there is time for the roots of the young plants to fix to grasfs themselves before the sharp frosts set in. It is scarce necessary to say, that moist weather is best for sowing; the earth being then warm, the seed will vegetate immediately; but if this season prove unfavourable, they will do very well the middle of March following.\n\nIf you would have fine pasture, never sow on foul land. On the contrary, plough it well, and clear it from the roots of couch-grasfs, reft-harrow, fern, broom, and all other noxious weeds. If these are suffered to remain, they will soon get above and destroy your young grasfs. Rake these up in heaps, and burn them on the land, and spread the ashes as a manure. These ploughings and harrowings should be repeated in dry weather.\nCulture of weather. And if the soil be clayey and wet, make some under-drains to carry off the water, which, if suffered to remain, will not only chill the grass, but make it sour. Before sowing, lay the land as level and fine as possible. If your grass seeds are clean (which should always be the case), three bushels will be sufficient per acre. When sown, harrow it in gently, and roll it in with a wooden roller. When it comes up, fill up all the bare spots by fresh feed, which, if rolled to fix it, will soon come up and overtake the rest.\n\nIn Norfolk they sow clover with their grasses, particularly with rye-grass; but this should not be done except when the land is designed for grass only three or four years, because neither of these kinds will last long in the land. Where you intend it for a continuance, it is better to mix only small white Dutch clover, or marl grass, with your other grass seed, and not more than eight pounds to an acre. These are abiding plants, spread close on the surface, and make the sweetest feed of any for cattle. In the following spring, root up thistles, hemlock, or any large plants that appear. The doing this while the ground is soft enough to permit your drawing them up by the roots, and before they feed, will save you infinite trouble afterwards.\n\nThe common method of proceeding in laying down fields to grass is extremely injudicious. Some sow barley with their grasses, which they suppose to be useful in shading them, without considering how much the corn draws away the nourishment from the land.\n\nOthers take their feeds from a foul hay rick; by which means, besides filling the land with rubbish and weeds, what they intend for dry feeds may have come from moist, where it grew naturally, and vice versa. The consequence is, that the ground, instead of being covered with a good thick layer, is filled with plants unnatural to it. The kinds of grass most eligible for pasture lands are, the annual meadow, creeping, and fine bent, the fox's tail, and the crested dog's tail, the poas, the fescues, the vernal oat-grass, and the ray or rye-grass. We do not, however, approve of sowing all these kinds together; for not to mention their ripening at different times, by which means you can never cut them all in perfection and full vigour, no kind of cattle are fond of all alike.\n\nHorses will scarcely eat hay which oxen and cows will thrive upon; sheep are particularly fond of some kinds, and refuse others. The darnel-grass, if not cut before several of the other kinds are ripe, becomes so hard and wiry in the stalks, that few cattle care to eat it.\n\nAs the subject of pastures is very important, we shall first take notice of the general mode of improving ordinary pastures, and of the particular grass plants that ought to be cultivated in them. After which we shall mention the celebrated modern improvements upon grass lands, by flooding them artificially with water.\n\nPasture land is of such advantage to husbandry, that many prefer it even to corn land, because of the small hazard and labour that attends it; and as it lays the foundation for most of the profit that is expected from the arable land, because of the manure afforded by the cattle which are fed upon it. Pasture ground is of two sorts: the one is meadow land, which is often overflowed; and the other is upland, which lies high and dry. The first of these will produce a much greater quantity of hay than the latter, and will not require manuring or dressing so often; but then the hay produced on the upland is much preferable to the other; as is also the meat which is fed in the upland more valued than that which is fattened in rich meadows; though the latter will make the fatter and larger cattle, as is seen by those which are brought from the low rich lands in Lincolnshire. But where people are nice in their meat, they will give a much larger price for such as hath been fed on the downs, or in short upland pasture, than for the other, which is much larger. Besides this, dry pastures have an advantage over the meadows, that they may be fed all the winter, and are not so subject to poaching in wet weather; nor will there be so many bad weeds produced; which are great advantages, and do in a great measure recompense for the smallness of the crop.\n\nThe first improvement of upland pasture is, by fencing it, and dividing it into small fields of four, five, land pasture, eight, or ten acres each, planting timber trees in the hedge-rows, which will screen the grass from the dry pinching winds of March, which will prevent the grass from growing in large open lands; so that if April proves a dry month, the land produces very little hay; whereas in the sheltered fields, the grass will begin to grow early in March, and will cover the ground, and prevent the sun from parching the roots of the grass, whereby it will keep growing, so as to afford a tolerable crop if the spring should prove dry. But in fencing of land the inclosure must not be made too small, especially where the hedge-rows are planted with trees; because, when the trees are advanced to a considerable height, they will spread over the land; and where they are close, will render the grass too four, that instead of being of an advantage, it will greatly injure the pasture.\n\nThe next improvement of upland pasture is, to make the turf good, where, either from the badness of the soil, or for want of proper care, the grass hath been destroyed by rushes, bushes, or mole-hills. Where the surface of the land is clayey and cold, it may be improved by paring it off, and burning it; but if it is a hot sandy land, then chalk, lime, marl, or clay, are very proper manures to lay upon it; but these should be laid in pretty good quantities, otherwise they will be of little service to the land.\n\nIf the ground is overrun with bushes or rushes, it will be of great advantage to the land to grub them up towards the latter part of summer, and after they are dried to burn them, and spread the ashes over the ground just before the autumnal rains; at which time the surface of the land should be levelled, and sown with grass seed, which will come up in a short time, and make good grass the following spring. So also, when the land is full of mole-hills, these should be pared off, and either burnt for the ashes, or spread immediately on the ground when they are pared off, observing to sow the bare patches with grass seed just as the autumnal rains begin.\n\nWhere the land has been thus managed, it will be of great service to roll the turf in the months of February and March with a heavy wooden roller; always observing to do it in moist weather, that the roller may make an impression; this will render the surface level.\nCulture of level, and make it much easier to mow the grass than when the ground lies in hills; and will also cause the turf to thicken, so as to have what people usually term a good bottom. The grass likewise will be the sweeter for this husbandry, and it will be a great help to destroy bad weeds.\n\nAnother improvement of upland pastures is, the feeding of them; for where this is not practised, the land must be manured at least every third year; and where a farmer hath much arable land in his possession, he will not care to part with his manure to the pasture. Therefore every farmer should endeavour to proportion his pasture to his arable land, especially where manure is scarce, otherwise he will soon find his error; for the pasture is the foundation of all the profit which may arise from the arable land.\n\nWhenever the upland pastures are mended by manure, there should be a regard had to the nature of the soil, and a proper sort of manure applied: as for instance, all hot sandy land should have a cold manure; neat's dung and swine's dung are very proper for such lands; but for cold lands, horse dung, ashes, and other warm manures, are proper. And when these are applied, it should be done in autumn, before the rains have soaked the ground, and rendered it too soft to carry on; and it should be carefully spread, breaking all the clods as small as possible, and then harrowed with bushes, to let it down to the roots of the grass. When the manure is laid on at this season, the rains in winter will wash it down, so that the following spring the grass will receive the advantage of it.\n\nThere should also be great care taken to destroy the weeds in the pasture every spring and autumn: for, where this is not practised, the weeds will ripen their seeds, which will spread over the ground, and thereby fill it with such a crop of weeds as will soon overbear the grass, and destroy it; and it will be very difficult to root them out after they have grown such possession, especially ragwort, and such other weeds as have down adhering to their seeds.\n\nThe grass which is sown in these upland pastures seldom degenerates, if the land is tolerably good; whereas the low meadows, on which water stagnates in winter, in a few years turn to a harsh ruffly grass, though the upland will continue a fine sweet grass for many years without renewing.\n\nThere is no part of husbandry of which the farmers are in general more ignorant than that of the pasture: most of them suppose, that when old pasture is ploughed up, it can never be brought to have a good sward again; so their common method of managing their land after ploughing, is to sow with their crop of barley some grass seeds as they call them; that is, either the red clover, which they intend to stand two years after the corn is taken off the ground, or rye-grass mixed with trefoil; but as all these are at most but biennial plants, whose roots decay soon after their seeds are perfected, to the ground, having no crop upon it, is again ploughed for corn; and this is the constant round which the lands are employed in by the better sort of farmers.\n\nBut whatever may have been the practice of these people, it is certainly possible to lay down lands which have been in tillage with grass, in such a manner as that the sward shall be as good, if not better, than any natural grass, and of as long duration. But this is never to be expected in the common method of sowing a crop of corn with the grass seeds; for, wherever this has been practised, if the corn has succeeded well, the grass has been very poor and weak; so that if the land has not been very good, the grass has scarcely been worth having; for the following year it has produced but little hay, and the year after the crop is worth little, either to mow or feed. Nor can it be expected to be otherwise, for the ground cannot nourish two crops; and if there were no deficiency in the land, yet the corn, being the first and most vigorous of growth, will keep the grass from making any considerable progress; so that the plants will be extremely weak, and but very thin, many of them which come up in the spring being destroyed by the corn; for wherever there are roots of corn, it cannot be expected there should be any grass. Therefore the grass must be thin; and if the land is not in good heart to supply the grass with nourishment, that the roots may branch out after the corn is gone, there cannot be any considerable crop of clover; and as their roots are biennial, many of the strongest plants will perish soon after they are cut; and the weak plants, which had made but little progress before, will be the principal part of the crop for the succeeding year; which is frequently not worth standing.\n\nTherefore, when ground is laid down for grass, there should be no crop of any kind sown with the low upland feeds; or at least the crop should be sown very thin, and the land should be well ploughed and cleaned from weeds, otherwise the weeds will come up the first, and grow so strong as to overbear the grass, and if they are not pulled up, will entirely spoil it. The best season to sow the grass seeds upon dry land, when no other crop is sown with them, is about the middle of September or sooner, if there is an appearance of rain; for the ground being then warm, if there happen some good showers of rain after the seed is sown, the grass will soon make its appearance, and get sufficient rooting in the ground before winter; so will not be in danger of having the roots turned out of the ground by frost, especially if the ground is well rolled before the frost comes on, which will press it down, and fix the earth close to the roots. Where this hath not been practised, the frosts have often loosed the ground so much, as to let in the air to the roots of the grass, and done it great damage; and this has been brought as an objection to the autumnal sowing of grass; but it will be found to have no weight if the above direction is practised: nor is there any hazard of sowing the grass at this season, but that of dry weather after the seeds are sown; for if the grass comes up well, and the ground is well rolled in the end of October, or the beginning of November, and repeated again the beginning of March, the sward will be closely joined at bottom, and a good crop of hay may be expected the same summer. But where the ground cannot be prepared for sowing at that season, it may be performed the middle or latter end of March, according to the season's being early or late; for, in backward springs, and in cold land, we have often sowed the grass in the middle of April with success; but there is danger, in sowing late, of dry weather, and especially if the land is light and dry; for we have seen many times\nCulture of times the whole surface of the ground removed by strong winds at that season; so that the seeds have been driven in heaps to one side of the field. Therefore, whenever the seeds are sown late in the spring, it will be proper to roll the ground well soon after the seeds are sown, to settle the surface, and prevent its being removed.\n\nThe sorts of seeds which are the best for this purpose, are, the best sort of upland hay seeds, taken from the cleanest pastures, where there are no bad weeds; if this seed is fitted to clean it from rubbish, three bushels will be sufficient to sow an acre of land. The other sort is the *trifolium pratense album*, which is commonly known by the names white Dutch clover, or white honeyuckle grass. Eight pounds of this seed will be enough for one acre of land. The grass seed should be sown first, and then the Dutch clover seed may be afterwards sown; but they should not be mixed together, because the clover seeds being the heaviest will fall to the bottom, and consequently the ground will be unequally sown.\n\nWhen the seeds are come up, if the land should produce many weeds, these should be drawn out before they grow so tall as to overbear the grass; for where this has been neglected, the weeds have taken such possession of the ground as to keep down the grass, and starve it; and when these weeds have been suffered to remain until they have shed their seeds, the land has been so plentifully stocked with them as entirely to destroy the grass; therefore it is one of the principal parts of husbandry never to suffer weeds to grow on the land.\n\nIf the ground is rolled two or three times at proper distances after the grass is up, it will press down the grass, and cause it to make a thicker bottom; for, as the Dutch clover will put out roots from every joint of the branches which are near the ground, so, by pressing down of the stalks, the roots will mat closely together, as to form a fward so thick as to cover the whole surface of the ground, and form a green carpet, and will better resist the drought. For if we do but examine the common pastures in summer, in most of which there are patches of this white honeyuckle grass growing naturally, we shall find these patches to be the only verdure remaining in the fields. And this, the farmers in general acknowledge, is the sweetest feed for all sorts of cattle; yet never had any notion of propagating it by seeds, nor has this been long practised in England.\n\nAs the white clover is an abiding plant, so it is certainly the very best sort to sow, where pastures are laid down to remain; for as the hay-seeds which are taken from the best pastures will be composed of various sorts of grass, some of which may be but annual, and others biennial; so, when those go off, there will be many and large patches of ground left bare and naked, if there is not a sufficient quantity of the white clover to spread over and cover the land. Therefore a good fward can never be expected where this is not sown; for in most of the natural pastures, we find this plant makes no small share of the fward; and it is equally good for wet and dry land, growing naturally upon gravel and clay in most parts of England: which is a plain indication how easily this plant may be cultivated to great advantage in most sorts of land throughout this kingdom.\n\nTherefore the true cause why the land which has been in tillage is not brought to a good turf again, in the usual method of husbandry, is, from the farmers not distinguishing which grasses are annual from those which are perennial: for if annual or biennial grasses are sown, they will of course soon decay; so that, unless where some of their seeds may have ripened and fallen, nothing can be expected on the land but what will naturally come up. Therefore this, with the covetous method of laying down the ground with a crop of corn, has occasioned the general failure of increasing the pasture in many parts of Britain, where it is now much more valuable than any arable land.\n\nAfter the ground has been sown in the manner before directed, and brought to a good fward, the way to preserve it good is, by constantly rolling the ground with a heavy roller, every spring and autumn, as hath been before directed. This piece of husbandry is rarely practised by farmers; but those who do, find their account in it, for it is of great benefit to the grass. Another thing should also be carefully performed, which is, to cut up docks, dandelion, knapweed, and all such bad weeds, by their roots every spring and autumn; this will increase the quantity of good grass, and preserve the pastures in beauty. Dressing of these pastures every third year is also a good piece of husbandry; for otherwise it cannot be expected the ground should continue to produce good crops. Besides this, it will be necessary to change the seasons of mowing, and not to mow the same ground every year, but to mow one season and feed the next; for where the ground is every year mown, it must be constantly dressed, as are most of the grass grounds near London, otherwise the ground will be soon exhausted.\n\nCulmiferous grasses might be divided into two general classes for the purposes of the farmer, that it might be of use for him to attend to: viz. 1st, Those which, like the common annual kinds of corn, run chiefly to seed-stalks; the leaves gradually decaying as they advance towards perfection, and becoming totally withered or falling off entirely when the seeds are ripe. Rye-grass belongs to this class in the strictest sense. To it likewise may be assigned the vernal grass, dogs-tail grass, and fine bent grass. 2ndly, Those whose leaves continue to advance even after the seed-stalks are formed, and retain their verdure and succulence during the whole season, as is the case with the fescue and poa tribes of grasses, whose leaves are as green and succulent when the seeds are ripe and the flower-stalks fading, as at any other time.\n\n\"It is wonderful, Mr Stillingfleet remarks, to see how long mankind have neglected to make a proper use of plants of such importance, and which, in almost every country, are the chief food of cattle. The farmer, for want of distinguishing and selecting Culmiferous grasses for feed, fills his pastures either with weeds or negligence bad or improper grasses; when, by making a right of farmers' choice, after some trials, he might be sure of the best about the grass, and in the greatest abundance that his land admits of. At present, if a farmer wants to lay down grasses, his land to grass, what does he do? he either takes\nof his feeds indiscriminately from his own foul hay rack, or sends to his next neighbour for a supply. By this means, besides a certain mixture of all sorts of rubbish, which must necessarily happen, if he chances to have a large proportion of good feeds, it is not unlikely but that what he intends for dry land may come from moist, where it grew naturally, and the contrary. This is such a slovenly method of proceeding, as one would think could not possibly prevail universally: yet this is the case as to all grats except the darnel-grats, and what is known in some few counties by the name of the Suffolk-grats; and this latter instance is owing, I believe, more to the soil than any care of the husbandman. Now, would the farmer be at the pains of separating once in his life half a pint or a pint of the different kinds of grats feeds, and take care to sow them separately, in a very little time he would have wherewithal to stock his farm properly, according to the nature of each soil, and might at the same time spread these feeds separately over the nation, by supplying the feed shops. The number of grats fit for the farmer is, I believe, small; perhaps half a dozen or half a score are all he need to cultivate; and how small the trouble would be of such a task, and how great the benefit, must be obvious to every one at first sight. Would not any one be looked on as wild who should sow wheat, barley, oats, rye, peas, beans, vetches, buck-wheat, turnips, and weeds of all sorts together? yet how is it much less absurd to do what is equivalent in relation to grats? Does it not import the farmer to have good hay and grats in plenty? and will cattle thrive equally on all sorts of food? We know the contrary. Horses will scarcely eat hay that will do well enough for oxen and cows. Sheep are particularly fond of one sort of grats, and fatten upon it faster than any other, in Sweden, if we may give credit to Linnaeus. And may they not do the same in Britain? How shall we know till we have tried?\"\n\nThe grats commonly sown for pasture, for hay, or to cut green for cattle, are red clover, white clover, yellow clover, rye-grats, narrow-leaved plantain, commonly called ribwort, fainfain, and lucerne.\n\nRed clover is of all the most proper to be cut green for summer food. It is a biennial plant when suffered to perfect its seed; but when cut green, it will last three years, and in a dry soil longer. At the same time the safest course is to let it stand but a single year: if the second year's crop happen to be scanty, it proves, like a bad crop of peas, a great encourager of weeds by the shelter it affords them.\n\nHere, as in all other crops, the goodness of seed is of importance. Choose plump feed of a purple colour, because it takes on that colour when ripe. It is red when hurt in the drying, and of a faint colour when urine.\n\nRed clover is luxuriant upon a rich soil, whether clay, loam, or gravel; it will grow even upon a moor, when properly cultivated. A wet soil is its only bane; for there it does not thrive.\n\nTo have red clover in perfection, weeds must be extirpated, and stones taken off. The mould ought to be made as fine as harrowing can make it; and the surface be smoothed with a light roller, if not sufficiently smooth without it. This gives opportunity for distributing the seed evenly: which must be covered by a small harrow with teeth no larger than those of a garden rake, three inches long, and six inches aunder*. In harrowing, the man should walk behind *Plate with a rope in his hand fixed to the back part of the VIII.fig.7- harrow, ready to disentangle it from stones, clods, turnip or cabbage roots, which would trail the seed, and displace it.\n\nNature has not determined any precise depth for the seed of red clover more than of other seed. It will grow vigorously from two inches deep, and it will grow when barely covered. Half an inch may be reckoned the most advantageous position in clay soil, a whole inch in what is light or loole. It is a vulgar error, that small feed ought to be sparingly covered. Milled by that error, farmers commonly cover their clover feed with a bulky branch of thorn; which not only covers it unequally, but leaves part on the surface to wither in the air.\n\nThe proper season for sowing red clover, is from the middle of April to the middle of May. It will spring from the first of March to the end of August; but such liberty ought not to be taken except from necessity.\n\nThere cannot be a greater blunder in husbandry than to be sparing of feed. Ideal writers talk of sowing an acre with four pounds. That quantity of seed, say they, will fill an acre with plants as thick as they ought to stand. This rule may be admitted where grain is the object; but it will not answer with respect to grats. Grats feed cannot be sown too thick: the plants flutter one another; they retain all the dew; and they must push upward, having no room laterally. Observe the place where a lack of pease, or of other grain, has been let down for sowing: the feed dropt there accidentally grows more quickly than in the rest of the field sown thin out of hand. A young plant of clover, or of fainfain, according to Tull, may be raised to a great size where it has room; but the field will not produce half the quantity. When red clover is sown for cutting green, there ought not to be less than 24 pounds to an acre. A field of clover is seldom too thick: the smaller a item be, the more acceptable it is to cattle. It is often too thin; and when so, the items tend to wood.\n\nGrain may be sown more safely with red clover than with almost any other grats; and the most common with proper grain has been found to be flax. The foil grain must be highly cultivated for flax as well as for red clover. The proper season of sowing is the same for both; the leaves of flax being very small, admit of free circulation of air; and flax being an early crop, is removed to early as to give the clover time for growing. In a rich soil it has grown to fast, as to afford a good cutting that very year. Next to flax, barley is the best companion to clover. The soil must be loole and free for barley; and so it ought to be for clover: the season of sowing is the same; and the clover is well established in the ground before it is overtopped by the barley. At the same time, barley commonly is sooner cut than either oats or wheat. In a word, barley is rather a nurse than a stepmother to clover during its infancy. When clover is sown in spring upon wheat, the soil which has lain five or six months without being stirred, is an improper bed for it; and the wheat, being in the vigour of growth, overtops\nCulture of overtops it from the beginning. It cannot be sown along with oats, because of the hazard of frost; and when sown as usual among the oats three inches high, it is overtopped, and never enjoys free air till the oats be cut. Add, that where oats are sown upon the winter furrow, the soil is rendered as hard as when under wheat.—Red clover is sometimes sown by itself without other grain; but this method, before losing a crop, is not salutary; because clover in its infant state requires shelter.\n\nAs to the quantity of grain proper to be sown with clover: In a rich soil well pulverized, a peck of barley on an English acre is all that ought to be ventured; but there is not much soil in Scotland so rich. Two Linlithgow furlots make the proper quantity for an acre that produces commonly six bushels of barley; half a furlot for what produces nine bushels. To those who are governed by custom, so small a quantity will be thought ridiculous. Let them only consider, that a rich soil in perfect good order, will from a single seed of barley produce 20 or 30 vigorous stems. People may flatter themselves with the remedy of cutting barley green for food, if it happen to oppress the clover. This is an excellent remedy in a field of an acre or two; but the cutting an extensive field for food must be slow; and while one part is cutting, the clover is smothered in other parts.\n\nThe culture of white clover, of yellow clover, of ribwort, of rye-grafts, is the same in general with that of red clover. We proceed to their peculiarities. Yellow clover, ribwort, rye-grafts, are all of them early plants, blooming in the end of April or beginning of May. The two latter are evergreens, and therefore excellent for winter pasture. Rye-grafts are less hurt by frost than any of the clovers, and will thrive in a moister soil: nor in that soil is it much affected by drought. In a rich soil, it grows four feet high: even in the dry summer 1775, it rose to three feet eight inches; but it had gained that height before the drought came on. These grafts are generally sown with red clover for producing a plentiful crop. The proportion of feed is arbitrary; and there is little danger of too much. When rye-grafts is sown for procuring feed, five furlots wheat measure may be sown on an acre; and for procuring feed of ribwort, 40 pounds may be sown. The roots of rye-grafts spread horizontally: they bind the soil by their number; and though small, are yet so vigorous as to thrive in hard soil. Red clover has a large tap-root, which cannot penetrate any soil but what is open and free; and the largeness of the root makes the soil still more open and free. Rye-grafts, once a great favourite, appears to be discarded in many parts of Britain. The common practice has been, to sow it with red clover, and to cut them promiscuously the beginning of June for green food, and a little later for hay. This indeed is the proper season for cutting red clover, because at that time the feed of the rye-grafts is approaching to maturity, its growth is stopped for that year, as much as of oats or barley cut after the feed is ripe. Oats or barley cut green before the feed forms, will afford two other cuttings; which is the case of rye-grafts, of yellow clover, and of ribwort. By such management, all the profit will be drawn that these plants can afford.\n\nWhen red clover is intended for feed, the ground ought to be cleared of weeds, were it for no other purpose than that the feed cannot otherwise be preserved pure: what weeds escape the plough ought to be taken out by the hand. In England, when a crop of seed is intended, the clover is always first cut for hay. This appears to be done, as in fruit trees, to check the growth of the wood, in order to encourage the fruit. This practice will not answer in Scotland, as the seed would often be too late for ripening. It would do better to eat the clover with sheep till the middle of May, which would allow the seed to ripen. The feed is ripe when, upon rubbing it between the hands, it parts readily from the husk. Then apply the scythe, spread the crop thin, and turn it carefully. When perfectly dry, take the first opportunity of a hot day for threshing it on boards covered with a coarse fleecy. Another way, less subject to risk, is to stack the dry hay, and to thresh it in the end of April. After the first threshing, expose the husks to the sun, and thresh them over and over till no seed remain. Nothing is more efficacious than a hot sun to make the husk part with its feed; in which view it may be exposed to the sun by parcels, an hour or two before the hall is applied.\n\nWhite clover, intended for seed, is managed in the same manner. No plant ought to be mixed with rye-grafts that is intended for seed. In Scotland, much rye-graft seed is hurt by transgressing that rule. The feed is ripe when it parts easily with the husk. The yellowness of the stem is another indication of its ripeness; in which particular it resembles oats, barley, and other culmiferous plants. The best manner to manage a crop of rye-grafts for seed, is to bind it loosely in small sheaves, widening them at the bottom to make them stand erect; as is done with oats in moist weather. In that state they may stand till sufficiently dry for threshing. By this method they dry more quickly, and are less hurt by rain, than by close binding and putting the sheaves in shocks like corn. The worst way of all is to spread the rye-grafts on the moist ground, for it makes the seed malten. The sheaves, when sufficiently dry, are carried in close carts, to where they are to be threshed on a board, as mentioned above for clover. Put the straw in a rick when a hundred stone weight or so is threshed. Carry the threshing board to the place where another rick is intended; and go on till the whole feed be threshed, and the straw ricked. There is necessity for close carts to save the feed, which is apt to drop out in a hot sun; and, as observed above, a hot sun ought always to be chosen for threshing. Carry the feed in sacks to the granary or barn, there to be separated from the husks by a fanner. Spread the feed thin upon a timber floor, and turn it once or twice a-day till perfectly dry. If suffered to take a heat, it is useless for seed.\n\nThe writers on agriculture reckon sainfoin preferable to clover in many respects: They say, that it produces a larger crop; that it does not hurt cattle when eaten green; that it makes better hay; that it continues four times longer in the ground; and that it will grow on land that will bear no other crop.\n\nSainfoin has a very long tap-root, which is able to pierce very hard earth. The roots grow very large; and the larger they are, they penetrate to the greater depth; and hence it may be concluded, that this grass, when\nwhen it thrives well, receives a great part of its nourishment from below the surface of the soil; of course, a deep dry soil is best for the culture of sainfoin. When plants draw their nourishment from that part of the soil that is near the surface, it is not of much consequence whether their number be great or small. But the case is very different when the plants receive their food, not only near, but also deep below, the surface. Besides, plants that shoot their roots deep are often supplied with moisture, when those near the surface are parched with drought.\n\nTo render the plants of sainfoin vigorous, it is necessary that they be trown thin. The best method of doing this is by a drill; because, when trown in this manner, not only the weeds, but also the supernumerary plants, can easily be removed. It is several years before sainfoin comes to its full strength; and the number of plants sufficient to stock a field, while in this imperfect state, will make but a poor crop for the first year or two. It is therefore necessary that it be trown in such a manner as to make it easy to take up plants in such numbers, and in such order, as always to leave in the field the proper number in their proper places. This can only be done, with propriety, by sowing the plants in rows by a drill. Supposing a field to be drilled in rows at ten inches distance, the partitions may be hand-hoed, and the rows dressed in such a manner as to leave a proper number of plants. In this situation the field may remain two years; then one-fourth of the rows may be taken out in pairs, in such a manner as to make the beds of fifty inches, with six rows in each, and intervals of thirty inches, which may be ploughed. Next year, another fourth of the rows may be taken out in the same manner, so as to leave double rows with partitions of ten inches, and intervals of thirty: All of which may be hoed at once or alternately, as it may be found most convenient.\n\nThe great quantity of this grass which the writers on this subject assure us may be raised upon an acre, and the excellency and great value of the hay made of it, should induce farmers to make a complete trial of it, and even to use the spade in place of the hoe, or hoe-plough, if necessary.\n\nThe plants taken up from a field of sainfoin may be set in another field; and if the transplanting of this grass succeeds as well as the transplanting of lucerne has done with M. Lunin de Chateauneuf, the trouble and expense will be sufficiently recompensed by the largeness of the crops. In transplanting, it is necessary to cut off great part of the long tap-root: this will prevent it from striking very deep into the soil, and make it pull out large roots in a flopping direction from the cut end of the tap-root. Sainfoin managed in this manner, will thrive even on shallow land that has a wet bottom, provided it be not overstocked with plants.\n\nWhoever inclines to try the culture of this grass in Scotland, should take great pains in preparing the land, and making it as free from weeds as possible.\n\nIn England, as the roots strike deep in that chalky soil, this plant is not liable to be so much injured by drought as other grasses are, whose fibres strike horizontally, and lie near the surface. The quantity of hay produced is greater and better in quality than any other. But there is one advantage attending this grass, which renders it superior to any other; and that arises from feeding with it milch cows. The prodigious increase of milk which it makes is astonishing, being nearly double that produced by any other green food. The milk is also better, and yields more cream than any other; and the butter procured from it is much better coloured and flavoured.\n\nThe following remarks by an English farmer are made from much experience and observation.\n\nSainfoin is much cultivated in those parts where the soil is of a chalky kind. It will always succeed on the well-drained land where the roots run deep; the worst soil of all for sainfoin is where there is a bed of cold wet clay, which the tender fibres cannot penetrate. This plant will make a greater increase of produce, by at least 30 times, than common grass or turf on poor land. Where it meets with chalk or stone, it will extend its roots through the cracks and chinks to a very great depth in search of nourishment. The dryness is of more consequence than the richness of land for sainfoin; although land that is both dry and rich will always produce the largest crops.\n\nIt is very commonly trown broad-cast; but it is found to answer best in drills, especially if the land be made fine by repeated ploughing, rolling, and harrowing. Much depends on the depth at which this feed is trown. If it be buried more than an inch deep, it will seldom grow; and if left uncovered, it will push out its roots above ground, and these will be killed by the air. March and the beginning of April are the best seasons for sowing it, as the severity of winter and the drought of summer are equally unfavourable to the young plants. A bushel of seed trown broad-cast, or half that quantity in drills, if good, is sufficient for an acre. The drills should be 30 inches apart, to admit of horse-hoeing between them. Much, however, depends on the goodness of the seed, which may be best judged of by the following marks:\n\nThe hull being of a bright colour, the kernel plump, of a gray or bluish colour without, and if cut across, greenish and fresh withinside; if it be thin and narrow, and of a yellowish cast, it will seldom grow. When the plants stand single, and have room to spread, they produce the greatest quantity of herbage, and the seed ripens best. But farmers in general, from a mistaken notion of all that appears to be waste ground being unprofitable, plant them so close, that they choke and impoverish each other, and often die in a few years. Single plants run deepest and draw most nourishment; they are also easiest kept free from weeds. A single plant will often produce half a pound of hay, when dry. On rich land this plant will yield two good crops in a year, with a moderate share of culture. A good crop must not be expected the first year; but, if the plants stand not too thick, they will increase in size the second year prodigiously.\n\nNo cattle should be turned on the field the first winter after the corn is off with which it was trown, as their feet would injure the young plants. Sheep should not come on the following summer, because they would bite off the crown of the plants, and prevent their shooting again. A small quantity of soakers ashes as a top-dressing will be of great service, if laid on the first winter.\nIf the fainfain be cut just before it comes into bloom, it is admirable food for horned cattle; and if cut thus early, it will yield a second crop the same fainfain. But if it proves a wet fainfain, it is better to let it stand till its bloom be perfected; for great care must be taken, in making it into hay, that the flowers do not drop off, as cows are very fond of them; and it requires more time than any other hay in drying. Fainfain is so excellent a fodder for horses, that they require no oats while they eat it, although they be worked hard all the time. Sheep will also be fattened with it faster than with any other food.\n\nIf the whole fainfain for cutting proves very rainy, it is better to let the crop stand for seed, as that will amply repay the loss of the hay; because it will not only fetch a good price, but a peck of it will go as far as a peck and a half of oats for horses.\n\nThe best time of cutting the feeded fainfain is, when the greatest part of the feed is well filled, the first brown ripe, and the last brown beginning to open. For want of this care some people have lost most of their feed by letting it stand too ripe. Seeded fainfain should always be cut in a morning or evening, when the dews render the stalks tender. If cut when the sun shines hot, much of the feed will fall out and be lost.\n\nAn acre of very ordinary land, when improved by this grass, will maintain four cows very well from the first of April to the end of November; and afford, besides, a sufficient store of hay to make the greater part of their food the four months following.\n\nIf the soil be tolerably good, a field of fainfain will last from 15 to 20 years in prime; but at the end of seven or eight years, it will be necessary to lay on a moderate coat of well-rotted dung; or, if the soil be very light and sandy, of marl. By this means the future crops, and the duration of the plants in health and vigour, will be greatly increased and prolonged. Hence it will appear, that for poor land there is nothing equal to this grass in point of advantage to the farmer.\n\nClover will last only two years in perfection; and often, if the soil be cold and moist, near half the plants will rot, and bald patches be found in every part of the field the second year. Besides, from our frequent rains during the month of September, many crops left for feeding are lost. But from the quantity and excellent quality of this grass (fainfain), and its ripening earlier, and continuing in vigour for much longer, much risk and certain expense are avoided, and a large annual profit accrues to the farmer.\n\nThe writers on agriculture, ancient as well as modern, bestow the highest encomiums upon lucerne as affording excellent hay, and producing very large crops. Lucerne remains at least 10 or 12 years in the ground, and produces about eight tons of hay upon the Scots acre. There is but little of it cultivated in Scotland. However, it has been tried in several parts of that country; and it is found, that, when the feed is good, it comes up very well, and stands the winter frost. But the chief thing which prevents this grass from being more used in Scotland, is the difficulty of keeping the soil open and free from weeds. In a few years the surface becomes so hard, and the turf so strong, that it destroys the lucerne before the plants have arrived at their greatest perfection: so that lucerne can scarcely be cultivated with success there, unless some method be fallen upon of destroying the natural grass, and preventing the surface from becoming hard and impenetrable. This cannot be done effectually by any other means than horse-hoeing. This method was first proposed by Mr Tull, and afterwards practised successfully by M. de Chateauvieux near Geneva. It may be of use therefore to give a view of that gentleman's method of cultivating lucerne.\n\nHe does not mention any thing particular as to the manner of preparing the land; but only observes in general, that no pains should be spared in preparing it. He tried the sowing of lucerne both in rows upon the beds where it was intended to stand, likewise the sowing it in a nursery, and afterwards transplanting it into the beds prepared for it. He prefers transplanting; because, when transplanted, part of the tap-root is cut off, and the plant shoots out a number of lateral branches from the cut part of the root, which makes it spread its roots nearer the surface, and consequently renders it more easily cultivated: besides, this circumstance adapts it to a shallow soil, in which, if left in its natural state, it would not grow.\n\nThe transplanting of lucerne is attended with many advantages. The land may be prepared in the summer for receiving the plants from the nursery in autumn; by which means the field must be in a much better situation than if the seed had been sown upon it in the spring. By transplanting, the rows can be made more regular, and the intended distances more exactly observed; and consequently the hoeing can be performed more perfectly, and with less expense. M. Chateauvieux likewise tried the lucerne in single beds three feet wide, with single rows; in beds three feet nine inches wide, with double rows; and in beds four feet three inches wide, with triple rows. The plants in the single rows were six inches apart, and those in the double and triple rows were about eight or nine inches. In a course of three years he found, that a single row produced more than a triple row of the same length. The plants of lucerne, when cultivated by transplantation, should be at least six inches apart, to allow them room for extending their crowns.\n\nHe further observes, that the beds or ridges ought to be raised in the middle; that a small trench, two or three inches deep, should be drawn in the middle; and that the plants ought to be set in this trench, covered with earth up to the neck. He says, that if the lucerne be sown in spring, and in a warm soil, it will be ready for transplanting in September; that, if the weather be too hot and dry, the transplanting should be delayed till October; and that, if the weather be unfavourable during both these months, this operation must be delayed till spring. He further directs, that the plants should be carefully taken out of the nursery, so as not to damage the roots; that the roots be left only about six or seven inches long; that the green crops be cut off within about two inches of the crown; that they be put into water as soon as taken up, there to remain till they are planted; and that they should be planted with a planting stick, in the same manner as cabbages.\n\nHe does not give particular directions as to the times of horse-hoeing; but only says, in general, that\nCulture of the intervals should be stirred once in the month during the whole time that the lucerne is in a growing state. He likewise observes, that great care ought to be taken not to suffer any weeds to grow among the plants, at least for the first two or three years; and for this purpose, that the rows, as well as the edges of the intervals where the plough cannot go, should be weeded by the hand.\n\nBurnet is peculiarly adapted to poor land; besides, it proves an excellent winter-pasture when hardly anything else vegetates. Other advantages are, it makes good butter; it never blows or swells cattle; it is fine pasture for sheep; and will flourish well on poor, light, sandy, or stony soils, or even on dry chalk hills.\n\nThe cultivation of it is neither hazardous nor expensive. If the land is prepared as is generally done for turnips, there is no danger of its failing. After the first year, it will be attended with very little expense, as the flat circular spread of its leaves will keep down, or prevent the growth of weeds.\n\nOn the failure of turnips, either from the fly or the black worm, some of our farmers have sown the land with burnet, and in March following had a fine pasture for their sheep and lambs. It will perfect its seed twice in a summer; and this feed is said to be as good as oats for horses; but it is too valuable to be applied to that use.\n\nIt is sometimes sown late in the spring with oats and barley, and succeeds very well; but it is best to sow it singly in the beginning of July, when there is a prospect of rain, on a small piece of land, and in October following transplant it in rows two feet apart, and about a foot distant in the rows. This is a proper distance, and gives opportunity for hoeing the intervals in the succeeding spring and summer.\n\nAfter it is fed down with cattle, it should be harrowed clean. Some horses will not eat it freely at first, but in two or three days they are generally very fond of it. It affords rich pleasant milk, and in great plenty.\n\nA gentleman farmer near Maldon, some years since, sowed four acres as soon as the crop of oats was got off, which was the latter end of August. He threw in 12 pounds of seed per acre, broad-cast; and no rain falling until the middle of September, the plants did not appear before the latter end of that month. There was however a good crop; and in the spring he set the plants out with a turnip hoe, leaving them about a foot distant from each other. But the drill method is preferable, as it saves more than half the seed. The land was a poor dry gravel, not worth three shillings an acre for anything else.\n\nThe feverish froth never injures this plant; and the oftener it is fed the thicker are its leaves, which spring constantly from its root.\n\nWe shall here enumerate a few more of the grasses which have been accounted valuable, or are likely to become so.\n\n*Alopecurus bulbosus*, Bulbous Foxtail-grass, is recommended by Dr. Anderson *, as promising on some occasions to afford a valuable pasture-grass. It seems chiefly, he observes, to delight in a moist soil, and therefore promises to be only fit for a meadow pasture-grass. The quality that first recommended it to his notice, was the unusual firmness that its matted roots gave to the surface of the ground, naturally soft and culture of moist, in which it grew; which seemed to promise that it might be of use upon such soils, chiefly in preventing them from being much poached by the feet of cattle which might pasture upon them. Moist soils especially are so much hurt by poaching, that anything that promises to be of use in preventing it deserves to be attended to.\n\n*Poa pratensis*, Great Meadow-grass, seems to approach in many respects to the nature of the purple dows-grass; only that its leaves are broader, and not near so long, being only about a foot or 16 inches at their greatest length. Like it, it produces few seed stalks and many leaves, and is an abiding plant. It affects chiefly the dry parts of meadows, though it is to be found on most good pastures. It is very retentive of its seeds, and may therefore be suffered to remain till the stalks are quite dry. It blooms the beginning of June, and its seeds are ripe in July.\n\n*Poa compressa*, Creeping Meadow-grass, according to Dr. Anderson, seems to be the most valuable meadow-grass of any of this genus. Its leaves are firm and succulent, of a dark Saxon-green colour; and grow so close upon one another, as to form the richest pile of pasture-grass. The flower-stalks, if suffered to grow, appear in sufficient quantities; but the growth of these does not prevent the growth of the leaves, both advancing together during the whole summer; and when the stalks fade, the leaves continue as green as before. Its leaves are much larger and more abundant than the common meadow-grass, *poa trivialis*; and therefore it better deserves to be cultivated.\n\n*Anthoxanthum odoratum*, Vernal Grass, grows very commonly on dry hills, and likewise on found grass-rich meadow-land. It is one of the earliest grasses we have; and from its being found on such kinds of pastures as sheep are fond of, and from whence excellent mutton comes, it is most likely to be a good grass for sheep pastures. It gives a grateful odour to hay. In one respect, it is very easy to gather, as it sheds its seeds upon the least rubbing. A correspondent of the Bath Society, however, mentions a difficulty that occurs in collecting them, owing to its being surrounded with taller grasses at the time of its ripening, and being almost hid among them. If it be not carefully watched when nearly ripe, he observes, and gathered within a few days after it comes to maturity, great part of the seed will be lost. The twisted elastic awns, which adhere to the seed, lift them out of their receptacles with the least motion from the wind, even while the straw and ear remain quite erect. It is found mostly in the moist parts of meadows; very little of it on dry pastures. It flowers about the beginning of May, and is ripe about the middle of June.\n\n*Cynosurus cristatus*, Crested Dog's-tail Grass. Mr. Stillingfleet imagines this grass to be proper for dog's-tail parks, from his having known one, where it abounds, that is famous for excellent venison. He recommends it also, from experience, as good for sheep; the best mutton he ever tasted, next to that which comes from hills where the purple and sheep's fescue, the fine bent, and the silver hair grasses abound, having been from sheep fed with it. He adds, that it makes a very fine turf upon dry sandy or chalky soils; but unless swept over with the scythe, its flowering-flaws will look brown;\nCulture of brown; which is the case of all grasses which are not fed on by variety of animals. For that some animals will eat the flowering stems is evident from commons, where scarcely any parts of grasses appear but the radical leaves. This grass is said to be the easiest of the whole group to collect a quantity of seed from. It flowers in June, and is ripe in July.\n\n**Cocks-tail, or feather grass.**\n\n*Stipa pennata, Cock's-Tail, or Feather Grass.*\n\n*Agrostis capillaris, Fine Bent,* is recommended by Mr Stillingfleet, from his having always found it in great plenty on the best sheep pastures, in the different counties of England that are remarkable for good mutton. This grass flowers and ripens its seed the latest of them all. It seems to be lost the former part of the year, but vegetates luxuriantly towards the autumn. It appears to be fond of moist ground. It retains its seed till full ripe; flowers the latter end of July, and is ripe the latter end of August.\n\n**Mountain hair.**\n\n*Arrera flexuosa, Mountain Hair.*\n\n*—caryophyllina, Silver Hair.*\n\nThe same may be said of these two grasses as of the preceding one.\n\n**Festuca fluitans, Flote Fescue.** In a piece published in the *Annales Academiae*, vol. iii. entitled *Plante Efcultae*, we are informed, that \"the seeds of this grass are gathered yearly in Poland, and from thence carried into Germany, and sometimes into Sweden, and sold under the name of *manna feeds*.\" These are much used at the tables of the great, on account of their nourishing quality and agreeable taste. It is wonderful (adds the author), that amongst us these feeds have hitherto been neglected, since they are so easily collected and cleansed.\" There is a clamminess on the ear of the flote fescue, when the seeds are ripe, that tastes like honey; and for this reason perhaps they are called *manna feeds*.\n\nLinnaeus (*Flor. Suec.* art. 95.) says that the bran of this grass will cure horses troubled with botfly, if kept from drinking for some hours.\n\nConcerning this grass we have the following information by Mr Stillingfleet. \"Mr Dean, a very sensible farmer at Rufford, Berkshire, assured me that a field, always lying under water, of about four acres, that was occupied by his father when he was a boy, was covered with a kind of grass, that maintained five farm horses in good heart from April to the end of harvest, without giving them any other kind of food, and that it yielded more than they could eat. He, at my desire, brought me some of the grass, which proved to be the flote fescue with a mixture of the marsh bent; whether this last contributes much towards furnishing so good pasture for horses, I cannot say. They both throw out roots at the joints of the stalks, and therefore are likely to grow to a great length. In the index of dubious plants at the end of Ray's Synopsis, there is mention made of a grass under the name of *gramen caninum, supinum longissimum*, growing not far from Salisbury, 24 feet long. This must by its length be a grass with a creeping stalk; and that there is a grass in Wiltshire growing in watery meadows, so valuable that an acre of it lets for 10 to 12 pounds, I have been informed by several persons. These circumstances incline me to think it must be the flote fescue; but whatever grass it be, it certainly must deserve to be inquired after.\"\n\n**Alopecurus pratensis, Meadow Foxtail.** Linnaeus says that this is a proper grass to sow on grounds that have been drained. Mr Stillingfleet was informed, that the best hay which comes to London is from the meadows where this grass abounds. It is scarce in most parts of England, particularly Herefordshire, Berkshire, and Norfolk. It might be gathered at almost any time of the year from hay-ricks, as it does not shed its seeds without rubbing, which is the case of but few grasses. It is among the most grateful of all grasses to cattle. It is ripe about the latter end of June.\n\n**Poaa annua, Annual Meadow Grass.** \"This Annual grass (says Mr Stillingfleet) makes the finest of turfs, meadow. It grows everywhere by way sides, and on rich found grass commons. It is called in some parts the *Suffolk grass*. I have seen whole fields of it in High Suffolk without any mixture of other grasses; and as some of the best butter we have in London comes from that county, it is most likely to be the best grass for the dairy. I have seen a whole park in Suffolk covered with this grass; but whether it affords good venison, I cannot tell, having never tasted of any from it. I should rather think not, and that the best pasture for sheep is also the best for deer. However, this wants trial. I remarked at Malvern-hill something particular in relation to this grass. A walk that was made there for the convenience of the water-drinkers, in less than a year was covered in many places with it, though I could not find one single plant of it besides in any part of the hill. This was no doubt owing to the frequent treading, which above all things makes this grass flourish; and therefore it is evident that rolling must be very serviceable to it. It has been objected, that this grass is not free from *bents*, by which word is meant the flowering-stems. I answer, that this is most certainly true, and that there is no grass without them. But the flowers and stems do not grow so soon brown as those of other grasses; and being much shorter, they do not cover the radical leaves so much; and therefore this grass affords a more agreeable turf without mowing than any other whatever that I know of.\" The seeds of this species drop off before they are dry, and to appearance, before they are ripe. The utmost care is therefore necessary in gathering the blades, without which very few of the seeds will be saved. It ripens from the middle of April, to too late, it is believed, as the end of October; but mostly disappears in the middle of the summer. It grows in any soil and situation, but rather affects the shade.\n\nA new grass from America (named *Agrostis cornucopiae*), was some time ago much advertised and extolled, as possessing the most wonderful qualities, and the seeds of it were sold at the enormous rate of 68l. the bushel. But we have not heard that it has at all answered expectation. On the contrary, we are informed by Dr Anderson, in one of his publications*, that \"it has upon trial been found to be good for nothing. Of the feeds sown, few of them ever germinated; but enough of plants made their appearance, to ascertain, that the grass, in respect of quality, is among the poorest of the tribe; and that it is an annual plant, and altogether unprofitable to the farmer.\"\n\n**Chicorium Intybus, Chicory.**\n\nMr Arthur Young has anxiously endeavoured to diffuse a knowledge of this plant, and he appears to have\nCulture of have been the first person that introduced it into the agriculture of England from France, where it grows naturally on the sides of the roads and paths, and is sometimes cultivated as a fallow. When it has been sown by itself, in ground prepared by good tillage, it has yielded two crops the same year. When sown amongst oats, no crop is expected till the following year. This plant defies the greatest droughts, and resists every storm. Being of very early growth, its first leaves, which are large and tufted, spread widely, and cover the ground so as to retain the moisture and preserve its roots from the heat which so often dries up every other vegetable production; it has not any thing to fear from storms, for its thick and stiff stalks support themselves against the winds and heaviest rains. The most severe cold and frosts cannot injure it. The quickness of its growth, above all, renders it most valuable, because it furnishes an abundance of palatable fodder in a season, when the cattle, disquieted with their dry winter food, greedily devour fresh plants.\n\nThis plant is greedily eaten by all sorts of cattle, but it is difficult to make into hay. It is very voluminous, and dries ill, unless the weather be very favourable for it. The dry fodder, however, which it does yield, is eaten with pleasure by the cattle. The following is the result of an experiment made with it by Mr Young upon an acre of ground sown April 1788.\n\n| Produce of the year of sowing |\n|-------------------------------|\n| Cut July 24,                  | 9 10 |\n| October 17,                   | 9 14 |\n| Produce of the second year    |\n| 1789.

Dig up the ground, level and rake it, then sow each kind of seed thinly in a separate row, each row about a foot apart, and cover them over lightly with the earth; the latter end of August or beginning of September will be the most proper time for this business. If the weather be not uncommonly dry the seeds will quickly vegetate, and the only attention they will require will be to be carefully weeded. In about a fortnight from their coming up, such of the plants as grow thickly together may be thinned, and those which are taken up transplanted so as to make more rows of the same grass.\n\n\"If the winter should be very severe, though natives, as seedlings, they may receive injury; therefore it will not be amiss to protect them with mats, fern, or by some other contrivance.\n\n\"Advantage should be taken of the first dry weather in the spring, to roll or tread them down, in order to fasten their roots in the earth, which the frost generally loosens: care must still be taken to keep them perfectly clear from weeds. As the spring advances, many of them will throw up their flowering stems, and some of them will continue to do so all the summer. As the seed in each spike or panicle ripens, it must be very carefully gathered and sown in the autumn, at which time the roots of the original plants, which will now bear separating, should be divided, and transplanted, so as to form more rows; the roots of the smooth-flaked meadow-grass, in particular, creeping like couch-grass, may readily be increased in this way; and thus by degrees a large plantation of these grasses may be formed and much seed collected.\n\n\"While the seeds are thus increasing, the piece or pieces...\"\nCulture of pieces of ground, which are intended to be laid down, should be got in order. If very foul, perhaps the best practice (if pasture land) will be to pare off the sward and burn it on the ground; or if this should not be thought advisable, it will be proper to plough up the ground and harrow it repeatedly, burning the roots of couch-grass and other noxious plants till the ground is become tolerably clean; to render it perfectly so, some cleansing crop, as potatoes or turnips, should be planted or sown.\n\n\"By this means, the ground we propose laying down will be got into excellent order without much loss; and being now ready to form into a meadow or pasture, should be sown broad-cast with the following compositions:\n\nMeadow fox-tail, one pint;\nMeadow fescue, ditto;\nSmooth-stalked meadow, half a pint;\nRough-stalked meadow, ditto;\nCrested dog's-tail, a quarter of a pint;\nSweet-scented vernal, ditto;\nDutch clover (Trifolium repens), half a pint;\nWild red clover (Trifolium pratense), or in its stead,\nBroad clover of the slopes, ditto;\n\nFor wet land, the crested dog's-tail and smooth-stalked meadow may be omitted, especially the former.\n\n\"Such a composition as this, sown in the proportion of about three bushels to an acre on a suitable soil, in a favourable situation, will, I am bold to assert, form in two years a most excellent meadow; and, as all the plants sown are strong, hardy perennials, they will not easily suffer their places to be usurped by any noxious plants, which by manure or other means, in spite of all our endeavours, will be apt to infest themselves; if they should, they must be carefully extirpated; for such a meadow is deserving of the greatest attention: but if that attention cannot be bestowed on it, and in process of time weeds should predominate over the crop originally sown, the whole should be ploughed up, and fresh sown with the same seeds, or with a better composition, if such shall be discovered; for I have no doubt but at some future time, it will be as common to sow a meadow with a composition somewhat like this as it now is to sow a field with wheat or barley.\n\n\"One of the most important improvements in agriculture that has occurred of late years, is the practice of overflowing or flooding grass lands, which is now coming greatly into use, not only on level grounds, but in all situations in which a command of water can be obtained. In the Monthly Review for October 1788, the editors acknowledge the favour of a correspondent, who informed them, that watering of meadows was practised during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I. A book was written upon the subject by one Rowland Vaughan, who seems to have been the inventor of this art, and who practised it on a very extensive plan in the Golden Valley in Herefordshire. Till this note to the Reviewers appeared, the inhabitants of a village called South Cerney in Gloucestershire had affirmed the honour of the invention to themselves, as we are informed in a treatise upon the subject by the Rev. Mr Wright curate of the place. According to a received tradition in that village, watering of meadows has been practised there for about a century, and was introduced by one Welladuffe, a Culture of wealthy farmer in South Cerney. His first experiment was by cutting a large ditch in the middle of his ground, from which he threw the water over some parts, and allowed it to stagnate in others; but finding this not to answer his expectations, he improved his method by cutting drains and filling up the hollows; and thus he succeeded so well, that his neighbours, who at first called him a madman, soon changed their opinion, and began to imitate his example.\n\n\"The advantages which attend the watering of meadows are many and great; not only as excellent crops of grass are thus raised, but as they appear so early, that they are of infinite service to the farmers for food to their cattle in the spring before the natural grass rises. By watering we have plenty of grass in the beginning of March, and even earlier when the season is mild. The good effects of this kind of grass upon all sorts of cattle are likewise astonishing, especially upon such as have been hardly wintered; and Mr Wright informs us, that the farmers in his neighbourhood, by means of watering their lands, are enabled to begin the making of cheese at least a month sooner than their neighbours who have not the same advantage. Grass raised by watering is found to be admirable for the nurture of lambs; not only those designed for fattening, but such as are to be kept for store: For if lambs when very young are flopped and flinted in their growth, they not only become contracted for life themselves, but in some measure communicate the same diminutive size to their young. The best remedy for preventing this evil is the spring feed from watered meadows; and Mr Wright is of opinion, that if the young of all kinds of farmer's flock were immediately encouraged by plenty of food, and kept continually in a growing state, there would in a few years be a notable change both in the size and shape of cattle in general. Such indeed is the forwardness of grass from watered meadows, that the feed between March and May is worth a guinea per acre; and in June an acre will yield two tons of hay, and the aftermath is always worth twenty shillings; and nearly the same quantity is constantly obtained whether the summer be dry or wet. In dry summers also, such farmers as water their meadows have an opportunity of selling their hay almost at any price to their neighbours.\n\n\"Land treated in this manner is continually improving in quality, even though it be mown every year; faintly improving the herbage, if coarse at first, becomes finer; the soil proves by if swampy, becomes sound; the depth of its mould is augmented, and its quality meliorated every year.\n\n\"To these advantages (says Mr Bowdell in his treatise upon this subject) another may be addressed to the gentleman who wishes to improve his estate, and whose benevolent heart prompts him to extend a charitable hand to the relief of the industrious poor, and not to idleness and vice: almost the whole of the expense in this mode of cultivation is the actual manual labour of a class of people who have no genius to employ their bodily strength otherwise for their own support and that of their families; consequently when viewed in this light, the expense can be but comparatively small, the improvement great and valuable.\"\nAs a proof of the above doctrine, Mr Wright produces an instance of one year's produce of a meadow in his neighbourhood. It had been watered longer than the eldest person in the neighbourhood could remember; but was by no means the best meadow upon the stream, nor was the preceding winter favourable for watering. It contains five acres and a half. The spring feed was let for seven guineas, and supported near two sheep from the 1st of March till the beginning of May; the hay being sold for thirty guineas, and the after-math for five. Another and still more remarkable proof of the efficacy of watering, is, that two of the most skilful watermen of that place were sent to lay out a meadow of seven acres, the whole crop of which was that year sold for two pounds. Though it was thought by many impossible to throw the water over it, yet the skill of the workmen soon overcame all difficulties; and ever since that time the meadow has been let at the rent of three pounds per acre. From manifold experience, our author informs us, that the people in that part of the country are so much attached to the practice of watering, that they never suffer the smallest spring or rivulet to be unemployed. Even those temporary floods occasioned by sudden showers are received into proper ditches, and spread equally over the lands until their fertilizing property be totally exhausted. \"Necessity (says he) indeed compels us to make the most of every drop: for we have near three hundred acres in this parish, that must all, if possible, be watered; and the stream that affords the water seldom exceeds five yards in breadth and one in depth: therefore we may say, that a scarcity of water is almost as much dreaded by us as by the celebrated inhabitants of the banks of the Nile.\"\n\nConsidering the great advantages to be derived from the practice of watering meadows, and the many undoubted testimonies in its favour, Mr Wright expresses his surprise, that it has not come into more general use, as there is not a stream of water upon which a mill can be erected but what may be made subservient to the enriching of some land, perhaps to a great quantity. \"I am confident (says he), that there are in each county of England and Wales two thousand acres upon an average which might be thus treated, and every acre increased at least one pound in annual value. The general adoption therefore of watering is capable of being made a national advantage of more than one hundred thousand pounds per annum, besides the great improvement of other land arising from the produce of the meadows and the employment of the industrious poor. Such an improvement, one would think, is not unworthy of public notice; but if I had doubled the sum, I believe I should not have exceeded the truth, though I might have gone beyond the bounds of general credibility. In this one parish where I reside there are about three hundred acres now watered; and it may be easily proved that the proprietors of the land reap from thence one thousand yearly profit.\"\n\nIn Mr Bofwell's treatise upon this subject, published in 1790, the author complains of the neglect of the practice of improving the wet, boggy, and ruffly lands, which lie at the banks of rivers, and might be meliorated at a very small expense, when much larger sums are expended in the improvement of barren uplands and large tracts of heath in various parts of the kingdom: and he complains likewise of the little information that is to be had in books concerning the method of performing this operation. The only author from whom he acknowledges to have received any information is Blyth; and even his method of watering is very different from that practised in modern times; for which reason he proposes to furnish an original treatise upon the subject; and of this we shall now give the substance.\n\nThe first thing to be considered is, what lands are capable of being watered. These, according to Mr Bofwell, are all such as lie low, near the banks of rivulets and springs, especially where the water course is higher than the lands, and kept within its bounds by banks. If the rivulet has a quick descent, the improvement by watering will be very great, and the expenses moderate. On level lands the water runs but slowly, which is also the case with large rivers; and therefore only a small quantity of ground can be overflowed by them in comparison of what can be done in other cases: but the water of large rivers is generally possessed of more fertilizing properties than that of rivulets. In many cases, however, the rivers are navigable, or have mills upon them; both of which are strong objections to the perfect improvement of lands adjacent to them. From these considerations, our author concludes, that the watering of lands may be performed in the best and least expensive manner by small rivulets and springs.\n\nThere are three kinds of soils commonly found near the banks of rivers and rivulets, the melioration of which may be attempted by watering. 1. A gravelly or sandy soil, firm or soft, or a mixture of the two together. This receives an almost instantaneous improvement; and the faster the water runs over it the better. 2. Boggy, miry, and ruffly soils, which are always found by the banks of rivers where the land is nearly level. These also are greatly improved by watering; perhaps equally so with those already described, if we compare the value of both in their unimproved state, this kind of ground being scarce worth anything in its unimproved state. By proper watering, however, it may be made to produce large crops of hay, by which horned cattle may be kept through the winter and greatly forwarded; though, in its uncultivated state, it would scarcely produce anything to maintain stock in the winter, and very little even in summer. Much more skill, as well as expense, however, is requisite to bring this kind of land into culture than the former. 3. The soils most difficult to be improved are stony, wet, and clay soils; and this difficulty is occasioned both by their being commonly on a dead level, which will not admit of the water running over them; and by their tenacity, which will not admit of draining. Even when the utmost care is taken, unless a strong body of water is thrown over them, and that from a river the water of which has a very fertilizing property, little advantage will be gained; but wherever such advantages can be had in the winter, and a warm spring succeeds, these lands will produce very large crops of grass.\n\nThe advantage of using springs and rivulets for watering instead of large rivers is, that the expense of rivulets raising wares across them will not be great; nor are they liable to the other objections which attend the rivers.\nCulture of use of large rivers. When they run through a cultivated country also, the land floods occasioned by violent rains frequently bring with them such quantities of manure as contribute greatly to fertilize the lands, and which are totally lost where the practice of watering is not in use.\n\nSprings may be useful to the coarse lands that lie near them, provided the water can be had in sufficient quantity to overflow the lands. \"By springs (says our author), are not here meant such as rise out of poor heath or boggy lands (for the water issuing from them is generally so small in quantity, and always so very lean and hungry in quality, that little if any advantage can be derived from it); but rather the head of rivulets and brooks rising out of a chalky and gravelly found firm soil, in a cultivated country. These are invaluable; and every possible advantage should be taken to improve the ground near them. The author knows a considerable tract of meadow-land under this predicament; and one meadow in particular that is watered by springs issuing immediately out of such a soil, without any advantage from great towns, &c., being situated but a small distance below the head of the rivulet, and the rivulet itself is fed all the way by springs rising out of its bed as clear as crystal. The soil of the meadow is a good loam some inches deep, upon a fine springy gravel. Whether it is from the heat of the springs, or whether the friction by the water running over the soil raises a certain degree of warmth favourable to vegetation, or from whatever cause it arises, the fecundity of this water is beyond conception; for when the meadow has been properly watered and well drained, in a warm spring, the grass has been frequently cut for hay within five weeks from the time the stock was taken out of it, having eat it bare to the earth: almost every year it is cut in six weeks, and the produce from one to three waggon loads to an acre. In land thus situated, in the mornings and evenings in the months of April, May, and June, the whole meadow will appear like a large furnace: so considerable is the steam or vapour which arises from the warmth of the springs acted upon by the sun-beams: and although the water is so exceeding clear, yet upon its being thrown over the land only a few days in warm weather, by dribbling through the grass, so thick a scum will arise and adhere to the blades of the grass, as will be equal to a considerable quantity of manure spread over the land, and (it may be presumed from the good effects) still more enriching.\n\n\"It is inconceivable what 24 hours water properly conveyed over the lands will do in such a season: a beautiful verdure will arise in a few days where a parched rusty soil could only be seen; and one acre will then be found to maintain more stock than ten could do before.\"\n\nMr Bofwell next proceeds to an explanation of the terms used in this art; of the instruments necessary to perform it; and of the principles on which it is founded. The terms used are:\n\n1. A Ware. This is an erection across a brook, rivulet, or river, frequently constructed of timber, but more commonly of bricks or stones and timber, with openings to let the water pass, from two to ten in number according to the breadth of the stream: the height being always equal to the depth of the stream compared with the adjacent land. The use of this is occasionally to stop the current, and to turn it aside into the adjacent lands.\n\n2. A Sluice is constructed in the same manner as a ware; only that it has but a single passage for the water, and is put across small streams for the same purpose as a ware.\n\n3. A Trunk is designed to answer the same purpose as a sluice; but being placed across such streams as either cattle or teams are to pass over, or where it is necessary to carry a small stream at right angles to a large one to water some lands lower down, is for these reasons made of timber, and is of a square figure. The length and breadth are various, as circumstances determine.\n\n4. A Carriage is made of timber or of brick. If of timber, oak is the best; if of brick, an arch ought to be thrown over the stream that runs under it, and the sides bricked up: But when made of timber, which is the most common material, it is constructed with a bottom and sides as wide and high as the main in which it lies. It must be made very strong, close, and well jointed. Its use is to convey the water in one main over another, which runs at right angles to it; the depth and breadth are the same with those of the main to which it belongs: and the length is determined by that which it crosses. The carriage is the most expensive instrument belonging to watering.\n\n5. A Drain-Sluice, or Drain-Trunk, is always placed in the lower part of some main, as near to the head as a drain can be found; that is, situated low enough to draw the main, &c. It is made of timber, of a square figure like a trunk, only much smaller. It is placed with its mouth at the bottom of the main, and let down into the bank; and from its other end a drain is cut to communicate with some trench-drain that is nearest. The dimensions are various, and determined by circumstances. The use of it is, when the water is turned some other way, to convey the leaking water that oozes through the hatches, &c., into the drain, that otherwise would run down into the tails of those trenches which lie lowest, and there poach and rot the ground, and probably contribute not a little to the making it more unfruitful for sheep. This operation is of the utmost consequence in watering; for if the water be not thoroughly drained off the land, the soil is rotted; and when the hay comes to be removed, the wheels of the carriages sink, the horses are mired, and the whole load sometimes sticks fast for hours together. On the other hand, when the drain trunks are properly placed, the ground becomes firm and dry, and the hay is speedily and easily removed.\n\n6. Hatches are best made of oak, elm, or deal; the use of them is to fit the openings of wares, trunks, or sluices; and to keep back the water when necessary, from passing one way, to turn it another. They ought to be made to fit as close as possible. When hatches belong to wares that are erected across large streams, or where the streams swell quickly with heavy rains, when the hatches are in their places to water the meadows they are sometimes made so, that a foot or more of the upper part can be taken off, so that vent may be given to the superfluous water, and yet enough retained for the purpose of watering the meadows. In this\nAgriculture Practice.\n\n13. A Way-Pane is that part of the ground which lies in a properly watered meadow, on the side of the main where no trenches are taken out, but is watered the whole length of the main over its banks. A drain for carrying off the water from this pane runs parallel to the main. The use is to convey the hay out of the meadows, instead of the teams having to cross all the trenches.\n\n14. A Bend is made in various parts of those trenches which have a quick descent, to obstruct the water. It is made, by leaving a narrow strip of green sward across the trench where the bend is intended to be left; cutting occasionally a piece of the shape of a wedge out of the middle of it. The use is to check the water, and force it over the trench into the panes; which, were it not for these bends, would run rapidly on in the trench, and not flow over the land as it passes along. The great art in watering consists in giving to each part of the panes an equal proportion of water.\n\n15. A Gutter is a small groove cut out from the tails of these trenches where the panes run longer at one corner than the other. The use is to carry the water to the extreme point of the pane. Those panes which are intersected by the trench and tail-drains, meeting in an obtuse angle, require the assistance of gutters to convey the water to the longest side. They are likewise useful, when the land has not been so well levelled, but some part of the panes lie higher than they ought; in which case, a gutter is drawn from the trench over that high ground, which otherwise would not be overflowed. Without this precaution, unless the flats be filled up (which ought always to be done when materials can be had to do it) the water will not rise upon it; and after the watering season is past, those places would appear rusty and brown, while the rest is covered with beautiful verdure. Our author, however, is of opinion, that this method of treating water meadows ought never to be followed; but that every inequality in water meadows should either be levelled or filled up. Hence the waterman's skill is shown in bringing the water over those places to which it could not naturally rise, and in carrying it off from those where it would naturally stagnate.\n\n16. A Catch-Drain is sometimes made use of when water is scarce. When a meadow is pretty long, and has a quick descent, and the water runs quickly down the drains, it is customary to flop one or more of them at a proper place, till the water flowing thither rises so high as to strike back either into the tail-drains so as to stagnate upon the sides of the panes, or till it flows over the banks of the drains, and waters the grounds below, or upon each side. It is then to be conveyed over the land in such quantity as is thought proper, either by a small main, out of which trenches are to be cut with their proper drains, or by trenches taken properly out of it. In case of a stagnation, the design will not succeed; and it will then be necessary to cut a passage to let the stagnating water run off. Even when the method succeeds best, Mr. Boswell is of opinion, that it is not by any means eligible; the water having been so lately strained over the ground, that it is supposed by the watermen not to be endowed with such fertilizing qualities as at first; whence nothing but absolute necessity can justify the practice.\n\n17. A Pond is any quantity of water stagnating upon\nCulture of upon the ground, or in the tail-drain, trench-drains, &c., so as to annoy the ground near them. It is occasioned sometimes by the flats not having been properly filled up; at others, when the ware not being close shut, in order to water some grounds higher up, the water is thereby thrown back upon the ground adjacent.\n\n18. A Turn of water signifies as much ground as can be watered at once. It is done by shutting down the hatches in all those places where the water is intended to be kept out, and opening those that are to let the water through them. The quantity of land to be watered at once must vary according to circumstances; but Mr Bofwell lays down one general rule in this case, viz., that no more land ought to be kept under water at one time than the stream can supply regularly with a sufficient quantity of water; and if this can be procured, water as much ground as possible.\n\n19. The Head of the meadow, is that part of it into which the river, main, &c., first enter.\n\n20. The Tail is that part out of which the river, &c., last passes.\n\n21. The Upper Side of a main or trench, is that side which (when the main or trench is drawn at right angles, or nearly so, with the river) fronts the part where the river entered. The lower side is the opposite.\n\n22. The Upper Pane in a meadow, is that which lies on the upper side of the main or trench that is drawn at right angles with the river: where the river runs north and south, it enters in the former direction, and runs out in the southern, the main and trenches running east and west. Then all those panes which lie on the north side of the mains are called upper panes; and those on the south side the lower panes. But when the mains, trenches, &c., run parallel to the river, there is no distinction of panes into upper and lower.\n\nThe instruments used in watering meadows are:\n\n1. A Water level. The use of this is to take the level of the land at a distance, and compare it with that of the river, in order to know whether the ground can be overflowed by it or not. This instrument, however, is used only in large undertakings; for such as are on a smaller scale, the workmen dispense with it in the following manner: In drawing a main, they begin at the head, and work deep enough to have the water follow them. In drawing a tail drain, they begin at the lower end of it and work upwards, to let the tail water come after them. By this method we obtain the most exact level.\n\n2. The Line, Reel, and Breast-Plough, are absolutely necessary. The line ought to be larger and stronger than that used by gardeners.\n\n3. Spades. Those used in watering meadows are made of a particular form, for purpose of the work: having a stern considerably more crooked than those of any other kind. The bit is iron, about a foot wide in the middle, and terminating in a point: a thick ridge runs perpendicularly down the middle, from the stern almost to the point. The edges on both sides are drawn very thin, and being frequently ground and whetted, the whole soon becomes narrow; after which the spades are used for trenches and drains; new ones being procured for other purposes. The items being made crooked, the workmen standing in the trench or drain are enabled to make the bottoms quite smooth and even.\n\n4. Wheel and Hand-barrow. The former are used for removing the clods to the flat places, and are quite open, without any sides or hinder part. The latter are of service where the ground is too soft to admit the use of wheel-barrow, and when clods are to be removed during the time that the meadow is under water.\n\n5. Three-wheeled Carts are necessary when large quantities of earth are to be removed; particularly when they are to be carried to some distance.\n\n6. Short and narrow Scythes are made use of to mow the weeds and grass, when the water is running in the trenches, drains, and mains.\n\n7. Forks, and long Crooks with four or five tines, are used for pulling out the roots of sedges, rushes, reeds, &c., which grow in the large mains and drains. The crooks should be made light, and have long stems to reach wherever the water is so deep that the workmen cannot work in it.\n\n8. Strong Water-boots, the tops of which will draw up half the length of the thigh, are indispensible necessary. They must also be large enough to admit a quantity of hay to be stuffed down all round the legs, and be kept well tallowed to resist the running water for many hours together.\n\nThe principles on which the practice of watering meadows depend are few and easy.\n\n1. Water will always rise to the level of the receptacle out of which it is originally brought.\n\n2. There is in all streams a deficient greater or small-pend; the quantity of which is in some measure thrown by the running of the stream itself. If it run smooth and slow, the deficient is small; but if rapidly and with noise, the deficient is considerable.\n\n3. Hence if a main be taken out of the river high enough up the stream, water may be brought from that river to flow over the land by the side of the river, to a certain distance below the head of the main, although the river from whence is is taken should, opposite to that very place, be greatly under it.\n\n4. Water, sunk under a carriage which conveys another stream at right angles over it, one, two, or more feet below its own bed, will, when it has passed the carriage, rise again to the level it had before.\n\n5. Water conveyed upon any land, and there left stagnant for any length of time, does it an injury; destroying the good herbage, and filling the place with rushes, flags, and other weeds.\n\n6. Hence it is absolutely necessary, before the work is undertaken, to be certain that the water can be thoroughly drained off.\n\nIn Mr Wright's treatise upon this subject, the author considers a solution of the three following questions, as a necessary preliminary to the operation of watering.\n\n1. Whether the stream of water will admit of a temporary dam or ware across it?\n2. Can the farmer raise the water by this means a few inches above its level, without injuring his neighbour's land?\n3. Can the water be drawn off from the meadow as quickly as it is brought on?\n\nIf a satisfactory answer can be given...\nHaving taken the level of the ground, and compared it with the river, as directed by Mr Bofwell, cut a deep wide ditch near the dam as possible, and by it convey the water directly to the highest part of the meadow; keeping the sides or banks of the ditch of an equal height, and about three inches higher than the general surface of the meadow. Where the meadow is large, and has an uneven surface, it will sometimes be necessary to have three works in different directions, each five feet wide, if the meadow contains 15 acres, and if the highest part be farthest from the stream. A ditch of 10 feet wide and three deep will commonly water 10 acres of land. When there are three works in a meadow, and flood-hatches at the mouth of each, when the water is not sufficient to cover the whole completely at once, it may be watered at three different times, by taking out one of the hatches, and keeping the other two in. In this case, when the water has run over one division of the land for 10 days, it may then be taken off that and tumbled over to another, by taking up another hatch and letting down the former; by which means the three divisions will have a proper share of the water alternately, and each reap equal benefit. The bottom of the first work ought to be as deep as the bottom of the river, when the fall in the meadow will admit of it; for the deeper the water is drawn, the more mud it carries along with it. From the works, cut at right angles, smaller ditches or troughs, having a breadth proportioned to the distance to which some part of the water is to be carried, their distance from each other being about 12 yards. A trough two feet wide and one foot deep, will water a surface 12 yards wide and 40 feet long. In each trough as well as ditch place frequent stops and obstructions, especially when the water is rapid, to keep it high enough to flow through the notches or over the sides. Each ditch and trough is gradually contracted in width, as the quantity of water constantly decreases the farther they proceed. Between every two troughs, and at an equal distance from both, cut a drain as deep as you please parallel to them, and wide enough to receive all the water that runs over the adjacent lands, and to carry it off into the matter-drain with such rapidity as to keep the whole sheet of water in constant motion; and if possible, not to suffer a drop to stagnate upon the whole meadow. \"For a stagnation, says he, (though it is recommended by Mr D. Young for the improvement of arable land), is what we never admit in our system of watering; for we find that it rots the turf, fouls and starves the land, and produces nothing but coarse grass and aquatic weeds.\n\n\"When a meadow lies cold, flat, and swampy, the width of the bed, or the distance between the trough and drain, ought to be very small, never exceeding six yards; indeed, in this case, you can scarcely cut your land too much, provided the water be plentiful; for the more you cut, the more water you require. The fall of the bed in every meadow should be half an inch in a foot: less will do, but more is desirable; for when the draught is quick, the herbage is always fine and sweet. The water ought never to flow more than two inches deep, nor less than one inch, except in the warm months.\"\n\nMr Wright proceeds now to answer some objections made by the Reviewers in their account of the objections first edition of his work. 1. That the Gloucestershire to his farmers use more water for their lands than is necessary. To this it is answered, That where water is plentiful, they find it advantageous to use even more water than he recommends; and when water is scarce, they choose rather to water only one half, or even a smaller portion of a meadow at a time, and to give that a plentiful covering, than to give a scanty one to the whole. 2. The Reviewers likewise recommend a repeated use of the same water upon different and lower parts of the same meadow, or to make each drain serve water as a trough to the bed which is below it. But though this method is in some degree recommended by the celebrated Mr Bakewell, and taught by a systematical waterer in Staffordshire, he entirely disapproves of it; excepting where the great declivity of the land will not admit of any other plan. \"This cannot (says he) be a proper mode of watering grass-land in the winter time; for it can be of no service to the lowest parts of the meadow, unless as a wetting in spring or summer. The first or highest part of a meadow laid out according to this plan will indeed be much improved; the second may reap some benefit; but the third, which receives the exhausted thin cold water, will produce a very unprofitable crop. Our farmers never choose more than a second use in the same meadow, and that very seldom; they call even the second running by the significant name of 'small beer'; which, they say, may possibly satisfy thirst, but can give very little life or strength to land. It is a much better method to have a meadow laid out so as to be watered at several times, and to be at the expense of several small flood-hatches, than to water the whole of it at once by means of catch-drains.\n\n\"Sometimes it is necessary, in a large meadow, to convey the water that has been used under the works and troughs; and then the water above is supported by means of boards and planks, which we call a carry-bridge. Sometimes, the better to regulate the course of the water on the surface, especially in the spring, narrow trenches are dug, and the mould laid by the side of them, in order to be restored to its former place when the watering is finished. The earth and mud thrown out in cleansing and paring the ditches should be carried to fill up the low hollow parts of the meadow, and be trodden down with an even surface; which will easily be done when the water is on, the waterman being always provided with a strong pair of waterproof boots. If the mould thus used has upon it a turf that is tolerably fine, place it uppermost; but if it is fedgy and coarse, turn it under, and the water if it runs quick will soon produce a fine herbage upon it.\n\n\"The grounds that are watered in the easiest and most effectual manner, are such as have been ploughed and ridged up in lands about twelve yards wide. Here the water is easily carried along the ridge by means of a small ditch or trough cut along its summit, and then, by means of the stops in it, is made to run down the sides or beds into the furrows, by which it is carried into...\"\nCulture of into the master-drain, which empties itself into the river. Every meadow, before it is well watered, must be brought into a form something like a field that has been thus left by the plough in a ridged state. Each side of the ridge should be as nearly as possible an exact inclined plane, that the water may flow over it as equally as may be.\" Mr Wright does not, like Mr Boswell, disapprove of the use of flood-hatches; he only gives the following hint, viz. that their basis should be deep and firmly fixed, well secured with stone and clay, that it be not blown up. The following directions are given for each month of watering.\n\nIn the beginning of November, all the ditches, troughs, and drains, are to be thoroughly cleaned by the spade and breast-plough, from weeds, grats, and mud; and well-repaired, if they have received any injury from cattle. After a shower, when the water is thick and muddy, turn over the meadow as much water as you can without injuring the banks of the works, especially if the land be poor; as in this month, according to our author, the water contains many more fertilizing particles, which he calls fats and richnesses, than later in the winter. In defence of this position, of which it seems the Monthly Reviewers have doubted, our author urges, that though he is not able to prove it by any chemical analysis, yet it seems evident, that \"after the first washing of farm yards, various sinks, ditches, and the surface of all the adjoining fields, which have lain dry for some time, the common stream should then contain much more fatness than when the same premises have been repeatedly washed.\" This is confirmed by the experience of the Gloucestershire farmers; who, if they can at this season of the year procure plenty of muddy water to overflow their grounds for one week, look upon it to be equally valuable with what is procured during all the rest of the winter. In support of this, he quotes the following words of Mr Forbes, in a treatise on watering: \"The water should be let in upon the meadow in November, when the first great rains make it muddy, for then it is full of a rich sediment, brought down from the lands of the country through which it runs, and is washed into it by the rain; and as the sediment brought by the first floods is the richest, the carriages and drains of the meadow should all be scoured clean and in order, before the floods come.\"\n\n\"In opposition (adds Mr Wright) to the opinion of practical waterers, that the muddiness of the water is of little consequence, I hesitate not to affirm, that the mud is of as much consequence in winter-watering, as dung is in the improvement of a poor upland field. For each meadow in this neighbourhood is fruitful in proportion to the quantity of mud that it collects from the water. And, indeed, what can be conceived more enriching than the abundant particles of putrid matter which float in the water, and are distributed over the surface of the land, and applied home to the roots of the grats. It is true, that any the most simple water thrown over a meadow in proper quantity, and not suffered to stagnate, will shelter it in winter, and in the warmth of spring will force a crop; but this unwholesome force must exhaust the strength of the land, which will require an annual supply of manure in substance, or, in a course of years, the soil will be impaired rather than improved. The meadows in this county, which lie next below a market town or village, are invariably the best; and those which receive the water after it has been two or three times used, reap proportionally less benefit from it: For every meadow that is well laid out, and has any quantity of grats upon its surface, will act as a fine sieve upon the water, which, though it flow in ever so muddy, will be returned back to the stream as clear as it came from the fountain. This circumstance, when there is a range of meadows to be watered, the property of different persons, when water is scarce, creates vehement contentions and struggles for the first use of it. The proprietors are therefore compelled to agree among themselves, either to have the first use alternately, or for the higher meadows to dam up, and use only one half or a less portion of the river. Our farmers know the mud to be of so much consequence in watering, that whenever they find it collected at the bottom of the river, or the ditches, they hire men whole days to disturb and rake it with rakes made for the purpose, that it may be carried down by the water, and spread upon their meadows. One meadow in South Cerney, instance of I think, is an incontestible proof of the consequence of the good muddy water. It is watered by a branch of the common stream that runs for about half a mile down a public road. This water, by the mud on the road being continually disturbed by carriages and the feet of cattle, becomes very thick, and when it enters the meadow is almost as white as milk. This field, which consists of seven acres, was a few years ago let for 10s. an acre, but is already become the richest land in the parish, and has produced at one crop eighteen loads of hay, and each load more than 25 hundred weight.\"\n\nIn further confirmation of what our author affirms, Mr Wimpey quotes, from the Annals of Agriculture, the following words of Mr Wimpey: \"As to the forts of the subsoil, little is to be found, I believe, which does not encourage and promote vegetation, even the most simple, elementary, and uncompounded fluid: heat and moisture, as well as air, are the fine qua non of vegetation as well as animal life. Different plants require different proportions of each to live and flourish; but some of each is absolutely necessary to all. However, experience as well as reason universally shows, that the more turbid, feculent, and replete with putrefactive matter the water is, the more rich and fertilizing it proves. Hasty and impetuous rains, of continuance sufficient to produce a flood, not only dissolve the fats, but wash the manure in fulness off the circumjacent land into the rapid current. Such turbid water is both meat and drink to the land; and, by the unctuous sediment and mud it deposits, the soil is amazingly improved and enriched. The virtue of water from a spring, if at all superior to pure elementary water, is derived from the several strata or beds of earth it passes through, which, according to the nature of such strata, may be friendly or otherwise to vegetation. If it passes through chalk, marl, fossil shells, or any thing of a calcareous nature, it would in most soils promote the growth of plants; but if through metallic ores, or earth impregnated with the vitriolic acid, it would render the land unfertile, if not wholly barren. In general the water that has run fast is superior to that which immediately flows from the springs, and more especially that which is feculent and muddy, con-\nCulture of fishing chiefly of putrid animal substances washed down the stream.\"\n\nTo the same purpose also says Mr Forbes: \"There is great difference in the quality of water, arising by Mr For from the particles of different kinds of matter mixed with them. Those rivers that have a long course through good land, are full of fine particles, that are highly fertilizing to such meadows as are usually overflowed by them; and this chiefly in floods, when the water is fullest of a rich sediment: for when the water is clear, though it may be raised by art high enough to overflow the adjoining lands, and be of some service to them, the improvement thus made is far short of what is obtained from the same water when it is thick and muddy.\"\n\nMr Bofwell, though quoted by Mr Wright as an advocate for the doctrine just now laid down, seems, in one part of his work at least, to be of a contrary opinion. This is in the 14th chapter of his book, where he remarks upon another publication on the same subject, the name of which he does not mention: \"In page 4. of that pamphlet (says Mr Bofwell), the writer informs us, 'if the water used be always pure and simple, the effect will by no means be equal to the above; that is, of a stream that is sometimes thick and muddy. We have a striking instance of this in two of our meadows, which are watered immediately from springs that arise in the grounds themselves. Their crops are early and plentiful, but not of a good quality, and the land remains unimproved after many years watering.'\n\n\"The writer of this treatise (Mr Bofwell), in a former edition, had asserted, and in this repeated, the contrary effects from a stream very near the spring-head, as clear as crystal.\n\n\"The gentleman (Mr Beverly of Keld) whom that writer mentions in his preface, made a short visit last spring into Dorsetshire, to satisfy himself of the fact. The editor had the pleasure to show him the stream alluded to, which he traced almost to the fountain-head. It was perfectly clear, and the water was then immediately conveyed out of the stream upon the lands adjoining, some of which it was then running over; others it had been upon, and the verdure was then appearing. The gentleman expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the fact. To him the editor wishes to refer, &c. Mr George Culley of Fenton near Wooler in Northumberland, with a truly noble and public spirit that does him great honour as a friend to his country, sent a very sensible young man from thence into Dorsetshire, to learn the art of watering meadows, and to work the whole season in those meadows under different watermen. This man was often over those meadows, and worked in some just below that were watered by the same stream. Might the editor presume to offer his opinion upon this seeming contradiction, it is very probable that the soils, both the upper and under strata, are very different, as well as those through which the different springs run?\"\n\nFrom this passage, the latter part of which is not very intelligible, we might conclude that Mr Bofwell prefers clear to muddy water for overflowing meadows. In his chapter on land-floods, however, he expresses himself as follows: \"They will (says he) always be found of great use where the sweepings of Culture of towns, farm-yards, &c., are carried down by them; seldom any other erection is wanting besides a sluice or small ware to divert and convey them over the Advantages lands. If the situation of the land happen to be on of land, the tide of a hill, catch-drains are absolutely necessary floods, for watering the lower part of the hill, after the water has been used upon the upper. In many parts of the kingdom, where there are large hills or extensive rising lands, great quantities of water run from them into the valleys after heavy rains: These might with proper attention be collected together before they get to the bottom or flat ground, and from thence be diverted to the purpose of watering those lands that lie below, with great advantage to the occupier, and at a small expense. And should the land thus situated be Of converting arable, yet it would be found a beneficial exchange to convert it into pasture; particularly if pasture-ground should be a desirable object to the occupier.\n\nThe method of performing it is thus recommended. Observe the piece of land or field best adapted to the purpose, both for situation and soil. If it should be arable, make it first very level; and with the crop of corn sow all sorts of hay seeds; and as soon as it has got a green head it may be laid out. In the lowest part of the ground draw a deep ditch for the current to run through it; and continue it into some ditch or low part in the lands below, that the water may be freely carried off, after it has been and while it is in use. Draw ditches above the field intended to be watered affront the sides of the hill, in such a manner that they may all empty themselves into the head of the ditch above mentioned, just where it enters the field to be watered; then erecting a ware across this ditch, the field will be capable of being watered, according to the situation of the ditch in the middle or on the side of the field. It must then be conveyed by small mains or trenches, and subdivided again by branch-trenches, according to the site of the field and quantity of water that can be collected; trench-drains must be drawn, and the water conveyed into the ditch by means of tail-drains. A person unacquainted with water-meadows cannot conceive the advantage arising from water thus collected and conveyed over this species of water-meadow (if it may be so called), being generally a firm good soil; but the water running down from rich cultivated hills, eminences, &c., sweeps away with it, when the rain falls very heavy, vast quantities of dung dropped by sheep and other cattle, and the manure carried upon arable lands; all which being now diverted, and carried over the meadow with an easy descent, gives time for the particles of manure to subside upon the ground at one season, or of being filtered from it as it dribbles through the grats at another; after which, the warm weather pushes on vegetation amazingly. Meadows thus situated would be vastly superior to any other, if they had the advantage of a constant stream; but even as they are, taking the opportunity of watering them by every heavy rain or flood that happens, they will be found to be very valuable. The occupier of such lands is frequently advised to let no time be lost in appropriating them to this use; because these lands are healthy for all kinds of cattle at almost all seasons; and the expense of converting\nCulture of verting them into this kind of water-meadow is exceeding small, the annual charges afterwards quite trifling, and the produce very considerable.\"\n\nMr Wright, having discussed the subject of the quality of the water, proceeds to give directions for watering through the different months of the year:\n\n\"In December and January, the chief care consists in keeping the land sheltered by the water from the different months severity of frothy nights. It is necessary, however, of the year through the whole winter, every ten days or fortnight, to give the land air, by taking the water off entirely, otherwise it would rot and destroy the roots of the grass. It is necessary, likewise, that a proper person should go over every meadow at least twice every week, to see that the water is equally distributed, and to remove all obstructions arising from the continual influx of weeds, leaves, sticks, and the like. In February, a great deal depends upon care and caution. If you now suffer the water to remain on the meadow for many days without intermission, a white scum is raised, very destructive to the grass; and if you take off the water, and expose the land to a severe frothy night, without its being previously dried for a whole day, the greatest part of the tender grass will be cut off. The only ways to avoid both these injuries are, either to take the water off by day to prevent the scum, and to turn it over again at night to guard against the frost; or, if this practice be too troublesome, both may be prevented by taking the water entirely off for a few days and nights, provided the first day of taking off be a dry one; for if the grass experience one fine drying day, the frost at night can do little or no injury. The scum is generated chiefly by the warmth of the sun, when the water is thin and used too plentifully. Towards the middle of this month we vary our practice in watering, by using only about half the quantity of water which is made use of earlier in the winter, all that is now required being to keep the ground in a warm moist state, and to force vegetation.\n\n\"At the beginning of March, the crop of grass in the meadows is generally sufficient to afford an abundant pasturage for all kinds of stock, and the water is taken off for near a week, that the land may become dry and firm before the heavy cattle are turned in. It is proper, the first week of eating off the spring feed, if the season be cold, to give the cattle a little hay each night.\"\n\n\"It is a custom (says Mr Wright) with some farmers in Hampshire, to eat off the spring grass of their meadows with ewes and lambs, in the same manner that we do a field of turnips, by inclosing a certain portion each day with hurdles or stakes, and giving them hay at the same time. This is certainly making the most of the grass, and an excellent method to fatten and sweeten the future herbage. In this month and April, you may eat the grass as short and close as you please, but never later; for if you trespass only one week on the mouth of May, the hay-crop will be very much impaired, the grass will become soft and woolly, and have more the appearance and quality of an after-math than a crop. At the beginning of May, or when the spring feeding is finished, the water is again used for a few days by way of wetting.\n\n\"It is rather remarkable, that watering in autumn, winter, or spring, will not produce that kind of herbage which is the cause of the rot in sheep; but has been known to remove the cause from meadows, which before had that baneful effect. If, however, you use the water only a few days in any of the summer months; all the lands thus watered will be rendered tiring may unsafe for the pasturage of sheep. Of this I was lately convinced from an experiment made by a friend, the rot in sheep.\n\nAt the beginning of July, when the hay was carried off, and the water rendered extremely muddy and abundant by several days rain, he thought proper to throw it over his meadows for ten days, in which time a large collection of extremely rich manure was made upon the land. In about a month the meadow was covered with uncommon luxuriancy and blackness of herbage. Into this grass were turned eight found ewes and two lambs. In six weeks' time the lambs were killed, and discovered strong symptoms of rottenness; and in about a month afterwards one of the ewes was killed, and though it proved very fat, the liver was putrid and replete with the infect called the fluke or snail; the other ewes were sold to a butcher, and all proved unfruitful. This experiment, however, convinces me, by the very extraordinary improvement made thereby in the meadow, that muddy water in the summer is much more enriching than it is in autumn or winter; and ought, therefore, to be used for a week at least every wet summer, notwithstanding its inconveniences to sheep, the most profitable species of stock.\"\n\nMr Bofwell, besides his general directions for watering, gives many plans of the ditches, drains, &c., for particular meadows, some of them done from an actual survey. But these being confined to particular situations, we shall here only speak of his method in general. In his third chapter, entitled A General Description of Water-meadows, he observes, that \"lands capable of being watered, lie sometimes only on one well's side, and sometimes on both sides of the stream designed to supply them with water. In the former case, when they have a pretty quick descent, the land may be often watered by a main drawn out of the stream itself, without any ware;\" though he acknowledges that it is by far the best way to erect a ware, and to draw mains on each side, to dispose of the water to the best advantage.\n\nBoggy lands require more and longer continued watering than such as are sandy or gravelly; and the larger the body of water than can be brought upon them, the better. The weight and strength of the water will greatly assist in compressing the soil, and destroying the roots of the weeds that grow upon it; nor can the water be kept too long upon it, particularly in the winter season; and the closer it is fed, the better.\n\nTo improve strong clay soils, we must endeavour to the utmost to procure the greatest possible descent from the trench to the trench-drain; which is best done by making the trench-drains as deep as possible, and applying the materials drawn out of them to raise the trenches. Then, with a strong body of water, taking the advantage of the autumnal floods, and keeping the water some time upon them at that season, and as often as convenient during the winter, the greatest improvement on this sort of soils may be made. Warm sand or gravelly soil, are the most profitable under the watering system, provided the water can be brought over them.\nCulture of them at pleasure. In foils of this kind, the water must not be kept long at a time, but often shifted, thoroughly drained, and the land frequently refreshed with it: under which circumstances the profit is immense. A spring-feeding, a crop of hay, and two after-maths, may be obtained in a year; and this, probably, where in a dry summer scarce grass enough could be found to keep a sheep alive. If the stream be large, almost any quantity of land may be watered from it; and though the expense of a ware over it is great, it will soon be repaid by the additional crop. If the stream is small, the expense will be so in proportion.\n\nThe following method of improving a water-meadow that was springy has been tried by Mr Boswell with success. The meadow had been many years watered by a spring rising just above it from a barren sandy heath; the soil near the surface was in some places a gravelly land, in others a spongy cork, both upon a strong clay and sand mixture, which retained the draining of the lands above it. Whenever it had been watered, and left to drain itself dry, a yellowish red water stood in many parts, and oozed out of others; the herbage being no other than a poor, miserable, hairy grass and small fedge. Chalk and ashes had been thrown over it to very little purpose. It was then drained underground all along the different defecents, and all these drains carried into one large drain, which had been already cut for the purpose of carrying off the water when the meadow was overflowed. These drains were cut quite through the mixture of clay and sand, and as much deeper as the fall of the ground below would admit of; then, with chalk cut for the purpose, small hollow drains were formed at the bottom of these; the drains were then filled up with the materials that came out.\n\nThis was done in the beginning of summer, and the work frequently examined through the season; the soil was found firmer than before, and none of that nasty red water to be met with upon the surface, though it continually oozed into the drains. In autumn the meadow was again prepared for waterings, by repairing those trenches and drains that were properly situated; and by cutting others where wanted, for the purpose of watering the meadow. The water being then brought over it from the same spring as before, the event answered the most sanguine wishes of the proprietor; the effects were visible the first year, and the ground has been constantly improving ever since.\n\nMr Boswell also informs us, that a gentleman in Scotland had applied to him for directions to water some lands lying on the sides of hills, where the descent is quick; and of which there are many in this country, as well as in the south of England. It would be difficult to water such lands by means of drains and trenches according to the directions already given; because the bends in the trenches must be very near together and large, as the water must flow out of the trench above the bend to flow over the pane below it; the number and size would likewise be inconvenient, and greatly offend the eye.\n\nLands of this sort are generally capable of being ploughed; in which case our author directs them to be once ploughed in the spring, and sown with oats or any other kind of grain that will rot the furrow. When the grain is harvested, plough the land across; the last ploughing with the Kentish plough, which has a moveable mouldboard, and is called a turn-swift plough. This turns the furrows down the side of the hill, the horses going forwards and backwards in the same furrows. By this means the land is laid flat without any open furrows in it; dries it down in the spring very fine, and sow it with oats, and mix with some kinds of grass seeds very thick. Thus the ground will have but few irregularities; and as soon as the corn is carried off, or the following spring at farthest, the mains and drains may be cut out.\n\nFor watering coarse lands that are firm enough to bear the plough, and situated near a stream, our author gives the following directions.\n\n\"Let the land thus situated be ploughed once in the spring, and sown with any grain that will rotting coarsely. As soon as the crop is off, plough it again, and leave it rough through the winter. Work it down early in the spring, and plough it in the direction the trenches are to lie, making the ridges of a proper size for watering, ten or twelve yards wide for instance; work it fine; then gather the ridges up again in the same manner, making the last furrows of each ridge as deep as possible. If the land be not fine, dries it down again, and gather it up a second time if necessary; and with a shovel throw the earth from the edges of the furrows to the tops of the ridges, to give the greatest possible descent from the trench to the drain. Sow it with oats and grass seeds very thick; and after the corn is carried off, the trenches may be formed upon the top of each ridge, dispersing the furrows with a spade as much as the fall of the land will admit of for the drains; taking care to procure sufficient fall at all events, to drain the lands after they have been watered. By this method the crop of corn will nearly pay all the expense, and the land will be in excellent order.\"\n\nAfter the work of watering a meadow is totally finished, and the hay carried off, cattle may be let in to eat the after-math. When this is done, it will then be necessary to examine whether or not the mains have suffered any injury from their feet; whether there be quantities of mud or sand collected at the angles, &c., all of which must be thrown out and the breaches repaired; by which means the trenches, drains, &c. will last three years, but otherwise not more than two. The roots, mud, &c. may be used in repairing the breaches, but never left upon the sides of the trenches out of which they are taken. The tail-drains require to be cleaned oftener than any of the other works, for this obvious reason, that the mud, &c. is carried down from all the others into them; where, if it be allowed to accumulate, it occasions a stagnation of water upon the meadow itself. In repairing the trenches, particular care ought to be taken that the workmen do not make them any wider than before, which they are very apt to do; neither are they to be allowed to throw the materials which they dig out in a ridge behind the edge of the trench, which both widens it and promotes weeds.\n\nDuring the time of watering, it will be necessary to examine the meadow every two or three days in order to remove obstructions, &c. If the drains should be filled with water and run over, they ought to be made deeper; or if this cannot be done, they should be the meadow widened down.\nCulture of widdened. In the winter time a regular strong water should be kept, avoiding very strong great floods. In this season the water may be kept on the ground with safety for a month or even six weeks, if the soil be cory or boggy, or a strong clay; but not quite so long if it be gravel or sand. At the second watering a fortnight or three weeks will be sufficient; and after Candlemas a fortnight will be rather too long. At the third watering a week will be sufficient, which will bring it to about the middle of March; by which time, if the weather be tolerably mild, the grass will be long enough for the ewes and lambs, or fatting lambs; which may then be turned into the meadow with great advantage. Even in the end of February, if the winter has been very mild, the grass will be long enough for them. Here they may be permitted to feed till the beginning of May, changing them into different meadows. As soon as they are taken out, the water must be turned in for a week, carefully examining every trench and drain for the reasons already given. The water is then to be shifted into others, alternately watering and draining, lengthening the time the water remains upon it as the weather grows warmer; and in five, six, or seven weeks, the grass will be fit to be mown for hay, and produce from one to two tons, or even more, an acre upon good ground.\n\nMr. Bofwell directs, that about a week before the grass is to be mown, the water should be let into the meadow for 24 hours; which, he says, will make the ground moist at the bottom, the sycy will go through it more easily, and the grass will be mown closer to the ground. This practice, however, is entirely disapproved of by Mr. Wright. \"Though it may prevail in Dorsetshire (says he), it is very seldom advisable, for the following reasons: Water made to run through a thick crop of grass, though it may appear very pure, will leave a certain quantity of adherent scum or sediment, which can never be separated from the hay, but will render it unpalatable, if not prejudicial, to the cattle that eat it. And this wetting of the land and grass will impede the drying or making of the hay perhaps some days, which in difficult seasons is of very great consequence, and it will likewise make the turf too soft and tender to support the wheels of a loaded waggon in carrying off the hay. Besides, there is reason to believe that one day's wetting in the summer, will, upon most meadows, endanger the soundness of every sheep that feeds upon the aftermath.\"\n\nThe spring-feeding ought never to be done by heavier cattle than sheep or calves; for large cattle do much hurt by poaching the ground with their feet, destroying the trenches, and spoiling the grass. Mr. Bofwell likewise greatly recommends a proper use of spring floods, from which he says much benefit may be derived; but, if there is any quantity of grass in the meadows not eaten, these floods must be kept out; otherwise the grass will be spoiled; for they bring with them such quantities of sand and mud, which stick to the grass, that the cattle will rather starve than taste it. Great quantities of grass or aftermath are frequently spoiled in flat countries by the floods which take place in the fall. In the winter time, however, when the ground is bare, the sand and mud brought down by the floods is soon incorporated with the soil, and becomes an excellent manure. The certain rule with regard to this matter is, \"Make use of the floods when the grass cannot be used; avoid them when the grass is long or soon to be cut.\"\n\n\"It has often been a subject of dispute (says Mr. Bofwell), whether, from the latter end of autumn to the end of Candlemas, the throwing a very strong body of water, where it can be done, over the meadows, is of any essential service or not? Those who consider it as advantageous, assert, that when the waters run rude and strong over the ground, they beat down and rot the tufts of foggy or rough grass, fedges, &c. that are always to be found in many parts of coarse meadow-ground; and therefore are of peculiar service to them. On the other side it is alleged, that by coming in so large a body, it beats the ground (in the weak places particularly) so bare, that the sward is destroyed; and also brings with it such quantities of seeds of weeds, that at the next hay season the land in all those bare places bears a large burden of weeds, but little grass.\n\n\"The general opinion of the watermen upon this point is, that in water-meadows which are upon a warm, sandy, or gravelly soil, with no great depth of loam upon them, rude strong watering, even in winter, always does harm without any possible essential service. On the contrary, cold strong clay land will bear a great deal of water a long time without injury; and boggy, cory, or spongy soil, will also admit of a very large and strong body of water upon it with great advantage for almost any length of time at that season, provided the drains are made wide and deep enough to carry it off, with out forcing back upon the end of the panes. The weight and force of the water vastly afflicts in compreling those soils, which only want solidity and tenacity to make them produce great burdens of hay: nothing, in their opinion, corrects and improves those soils so much as a very strong body of water, kept a considerable time upon them at that season.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the above reasons, however, Mr. Bofwell informs us, that he has doubts upon the subject; nor can he by any means acquiesce in this opinion, unless, by rude strong waters he is permitted to understand only rather a larger quantity of water conveyed over the land at this early season than ought to be used in the spring or summer: unmanageable waters he believes always hurtful.\n\n\"It may be proper just to add (continues he), that as soon as the hay is carried off the meadows, cattle of any sort except sheep may be put to eat the grass out of the trenches, and what may be left by the mowers. This perhaps will last them a week; when the water may be put into the meadows in the manner already described, taking care to mow the long grass which obstructs the water in the trenches; and this mowing is best done when the water is in them. Let the weeds, leaves, &c. be taken out and put in heaps, to be carried away into the farm yards; examine the trenches, make up the breaches, &c. take particular care that the water only dribbles over every part of the panes as thin as possible, this being the warmest season of the year. The first watering should not be suffered to last longer than two or three days before it is shifted off (and if the season be wet, perhaps not so long, as warmth\nCulture of warmth seems to be the greatest requisite after the land is once wet to assist vegetation; to another part or meadow beat out by the cattle, by this time fit to take it. Do by this meadow exactly the same, and so by a third and fourth, if as many meadows belong to the occupier. Observe at all times, when the water is taken out of a meadow, to draw up the drain twice hatches; as, without doing that, watering is an injury. By the time that three or four parts are thus regularly watered, the first will have an after-math, with such rich and beautiful verdure as will be astonishing; and both quantity and quality will be beyond conception better than if the lands had not been watered.\n\nHence we see why every person should, if possible, have three or four meadows that can be watered; for here, while the cattle are eating the first, the second is growing, the third draining, &c., and the fourth under water. In this manner the after-math will in a mild season last till Christmas. A reason was given why the spring-grafts should be fed only by sheep or calves; a reason equally cogent may be given, why the after-grafts ought not to be fed by them, because it will infallibly rot them. No sheep (says our author), except those which are just fat, must ever be suffered even for an hour in water-meadows except in the spring of the year; and even then care must be taken that every part of the meadows have been well watered, and that they are not longer kept in them than the beginning of May. Although at present it is unknown what is the occasion of the rot, yet certain it is, that even half an hour's feeding in unhealthy ground has often proved fatal. After a short time they begin to lose their flesh, grow weaker and weaker; the best feeding in the kingdom cannot improve them after they once fall away; and when they die, animals like place are found in the livers. Scarcely any ever recover from a slight attack; but when farther advanced, it is always fatal. Guard by all means against keeping the water too long upon the meadow in warm weather; it will very soon produce a white substance like cream, which is prejudicial to the grafts, and shows that it has been too long upon the ground already. If it be permitted to remain a little longer, a thick foam will settle upon the grafts of the confluence of glue, and as tough as leather, which will quite destroy it wherever it is suffered to be produced. The same bad effects seem to arise from rude waters; neither can the foam easily be got off.\n\nRolling meadows in the spring of the year is an excellent method. It should be done after Candlemas, when the meadow has been laid dry a week. It should be always rolled lengthwise of the panes, up one side of the trench and down the other. Rolling also contributes much to the grafts being cut close to the surface when mown, which is no small advantage; for the little hillocks, spewings of worms, ant-hills, &c., are by this means pressed close to the ground, which would otherwise obstruct the scythe and take off its edge; and to avoid that inconvenience, the workmen always mow over them.\"\n\nAs a water-meadow has with so much justice been called a hot-bed of grafts, and as the practice of flooding tends to completely to ameliorate the poorest soils, and to extirpate heath and all coarse and woody plants, we are satisfied that the knowledge of it cannot be too extensively diffused, or too minutely enquired into.\n\nThat it may be more clearly understood, therefore, we shall here give a statement of the mode in which it is practised in Gloucestershire, as explained from Mr Wright's pamphlet, by the Rev. Mr Charles Findlater, in a letter to the conductors of the Farmer's Magazine.\n\nFig. 6 represents a float-meadow under irrigation; by Mr Findlater, the dark shading representing the water.\n\nWhen the hatch of the water dam-dike (marked H) Plate XII. is lifted up, the water runs in the natural channel of the river; when the hatch is shut, as represented in the figures, the natural channel is laid dry below it, and the water runs laterally along the main-feeder, in the direction of the arrows, and is from it distributed into the floating-gutters (g, g, g, g), which are formed along the crowns of the ridges, into which the meadow is arranged, overflowing on both sides of said gutters, and running down the sides of the ridges into the furrows or drains betwixt the ridges (d, d, d'), which drains discharge it into the main-drain, whereby it is returned into its natural channel at the foot of the meadow.\n\nThe marks (c, c, or Δ Δ), and the tufts, in the main-feeder and the floating-gutters, denote—The first, obstructions (made by small flakes, or sods, or stones) to raise the water, and make it flow over from the main-feeder into the floating-gutters, or from the latter over the sides of the ridges; the second, nicks, made in their sides, with a similar intention. If, however, the main-feeder and floating-gutters are properly constructed at their first formation, these supplementary aids will be, in a great measure, unnecessary: For the main-feeder ought, at its entrance, to be of dimensions just sufficient to admit the quantity of water which is to be conveyed to the meadow; and gradually to contract its size as it goes along, in order that the water, for want of room, may be forced over its side, and into the floating-gutters: these last ought to be formed after the same model, that the water may, by their primary construction, overflow their sides, through their whole course. That as little as possible of the surface may be unproductive, a similar construction should be adopted for the drains; they ought to be narrow nearest to the main-feeder, where they receive little water, and to diverge as they approach the main-drain; which last is, for the same reason, similarly constructed. In the plan, this mode of construction is made obvious to the eye.\n\nThe meadow, in this plate, must be conceived to lie in a regular and very gentle slope from the main-feeder to the main-drain.\n\nFig. 4, and fig. 5, present a view of the ridges cut across, with the feeding-gutter (g) upon their crown, and the furrows, or discharging drains (d, d') along their sides. Fig. 5 shows the shape (of gradual slope) into which they ought to be formed at first, were it not for the expense, i.e., when they are to be formed out of graft fields, preferring the grafts forward. Fig. 4 represents the mode in which they may, more cheaply, though more roughly, be formed at first; when, the depictions of sediment from the floating water, will gradually fill the shoulders of the floating-gutters, up to the dotted line, forming the ridge into the shape of fig. 5.\n\nIn the formation of the meadow, (particularly if the declivity is very small,) care should be taken to lose as little as possible of the level in the main-feeder, and in\nPart I.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nCulture of the floating-gutters; in order that the greater descent may be given to the water down the sides of the ridges, from the floating-gutters to their discharging drains, that the water may float over the ridges sides with the more rapidity, and in the more quick succession.\n\nThe distance from the floating-gutter to the discharging-drain, ought not to be less than four yards, i.e., the breadth of the ridge eight yards; nor more than five yards and a half, i.e., the breadth of the ridge eleven yards.\n\nIt is evident from the plan, that, when the hatch (H) is lifted up, the water resumes its natural channel, and the meadow becomes at once dry. Its figure frees it instantly of all surface water. If any of it is wet from springs, these must be carried off by under-draining; for it must be thoroughly drained before you can drown it to good effect.\n\nThis figure represents a float-meadow, where the declivity is unequal, and which, also, is too large, for the command of water, to admit of being floated all at once.\n\nIn this meadow, it is supposed that the ground rises, from the natural channel of the river, up to (F 1.), which is a feeder, with its floating-gutters (g, g, g); and thence descends to the hollow (D 1.), which is a drain communicating with the main-drain, and receiving the water from the lesser drains or receiving furrows (d, d, d). It is supposed, that the ground rises again from the hollow (D 1.), up to the second feeder (F 2.), and thence descends again into the hollow, above which is conducted the receiving-drain (D 2.). The remainder of the meadow is supposed to lie in a regular slope, from the main-feeder to the drain last mentioned, and the main-drain. The letter (r) marks a very small rut, made with a spade, or triangular hoe, for conducting water to places upon which it appears not to scatter regularly.\n\nThe hatch upon the river's natural channel, and that upon the feeder (F 2.) are represented as shut; and, consequently the natural channel, together with that part of the meadow which is floated from the feeder (F 2.), as dry. The hatches upon the feeder (F 1.), and upon the main-feeder, are represented as drawn up; and, consequently the two parts of the meadow, floated from them, are represented as under water.\n\nThis represents catch-meadow, for a steep declivity, or side of a hill. It is called catch, because, when the whole is watered at once, the water floating over the uppermost pitches is caught in the floating-gutters, which distribute the water over the inferior pitches.\n\nThe lateral horizontal feeding-gutters, which scatter the water over the first and second pitches, are represented as shut by rods or stones, &c. (8); and consequently these first and second pitches appear dry: The whole water is represented as passing down the main-feeder into the lowest floating-gutter, whence it floats the lowest or third pitch; and is received into the drain at the foot of the meadow, to be returned by it into the natural channel.\n\nWhen the whole is to be floated at once, the obstructions (8) are taken from the lateral floating-gutters: obstructions, meantime, are placed in the main-feeder, immediately under the floating-gutters, to force the water into said gutters.\n\nN.B. In obstructing the main-feeder, care must be taken not to obstruct it entirely, but to allow always a part of the water it contains to escape in it to the lower pitches; for, supposing the main-feeder to be entirely shut under the feeding-gutter (g 1.), so that the whole water was made to run over the first pitch, from said gutter and the horizontal part of the main-drain, the water filtrated through the grats of the first pitch, would be so very much deprived of its fertilizing qualities, as to be incapable of communicating almost any perceptible benefit to the pitches lying below. Water so filtrated, is called technically used water; and is esteemed next to useless; and for this reason, the grats nearest the floating-gutters is most abundant, and of best quality, in all kinds of meadow.\n\nThe proper breadth of the pitches of catch-meadow, from gutter to gutter, does not seem well determined; they ought, probably, not to be much broader than the distance from the floating-gutter to the receiving-drain in float-meadow, i.e., from four to five or six yards.—Catch-meadow is not so much prized as float-meadow.\n\nIn the construction of the float-meadows, the floating gutters die away to nothing before they meet the main-drain; the water from the end of the gutter finding its way over the intervening space, or being assisted in scattering by small ruts marked (r). The receiving-drains should, for like reason, not be commenced till within half a ridge breadth of the main-feeder.\n\nIt is to be observed with regard to the last of these modes of flooding, called catch-meadow, that although lands thus watered do not become equal to more level grounds subjected to the same process, or float-meadow, yet that the improvement of them is perhaps greater in proportion to the value of the lands in their original state; for, in this way, lands upon the declivity of hills, which once produced next to nothing, are enabled to bear a considerable crop of valuable grass. As streams of water are in high countries frequently found descending from very lofty situations, and as in these cases the expense of forming catch-meadow is very trifling, it may be regarded as of the most extensive utility.\n\nSect. V. Rotation of Crops.\n\nNo branch of husbandry requires more skill and sagacity than a proper rotation of crops, so as to keep crops the ground always in heart, and yet to draw out of it the greatest profit possible. Some plants rob the soil, others are gentle to it: some bind, others loosen. The nice point is, to intermix crops, so as to make the greatest profit consistently with keeping the ground in trim. In that view, the nature of the plants employed in husbandry must be accurately examined.\n\nThe difference between culmiferous and leguminous plants, is occasionally mentioned above. With respect to the present subject, a closer inspection is necessary. Culmiferous plants, having small leaves and few in number, depend mostly on the soil for nourishment and little on the air. During the ripening of the feed, they draw probably their whole nourishment from the soil; as the leaves by this time, being dry and withered, must have lost their power of drawing nourishment from the air. Now, as culmiferous plants are chiefly cultivated for their feed, and are not cut down till the\nRotation of feed be fully ripe, they may be pronounced all of them crops to be robbers, some more, some less. But such plants, while young, are all leaves; and in that state draw most of their nourishment from the air. Hence it is, that where cut green for food to cattle, a culmiferous crop is far from being a robber. A hay-crop accordingly, even where it consists mostly of rye-grass, is not a robber, provided it be cut before the seed is formed; which at any rate it ought to be, if one would have hay in perfection. And the faggotage, excluding the froth by covering the ground, keeps the roots warm. A leguminous plant, by its broad leaves, draws much of its nourishment from the air. A cabbage which has very broad leaves, and a multitude of them, owes its growth more to the air than to the soil. One fact is certain, that a cabbage cut and hung up in a damp place, preserves its verdure longer than other plants. At the same time, a feed is that part of a plant which requires the most nourishment; and for that nourishment a culmiferous plant must be indebted entirely to the soil. A leguminous crop, on the contrary, when cut green for food, must be very gentle to the ground. Pease and beans are leguminous plants; but being cultivated for feed, they seem to occupy a middle station: their feed makes them more severe than other leguminous crops cut green; their leaves, which grow till reaping, make them less severe than a culmiferous plant left to ripen.\n\nThese plants are distinguished no less remarkably by the following circumstance. All the feeds of a culmiferous plant ripen at the same time. As soon as they begin to form, the plant becomes stationary, the leaves wither, the roots cease to push, and the plant, when cut down, is blanched and leafless. The feeds of a leguminous plant are formed successively: flowers and fruit appear at the same time in different parts of the plant. This plant accordingly is continually growing, and pushing its roots. Hence the value of bean or pease straw above that of wheat or oats: the latter is withered and dry when the crop is cut; the former, green and succulent. The difference therefore, with respect to the soil, between a culmiferous and leguminous crop, is great. The latter, growing till cut down, keeps the ground in constant motion, and leaves it to the plough loose and mellow. The former gives over growing long before reaping; and the ground, by want of motion, turns compact and hard. Nor is this all. Dew falling on a culmiferous crop after the ground begins to harden, rests on the surface, and is sucked up by the next sun. Dew that falls on a leguminous crop, is shaded from the sun by the broad leaves, and sinks at leisure into the ground. The ground accordingly, after a culmiferous crop, is not only hard, but dry: after a leguminous crop, it is not only loose, but soft and uncultivated.\n\nOf all culmiferous plants, wheat is the most severe, by the long time it occupies the ground without admitting a plough. And as the grain is heavier than that of barley or oats, it probably requires more nourishment than either. It is observed above, that as pease and beans draw part of their nourishment from the air by their green leaves while allowed to stand, they draw the less from the ground; and by their constant growing they leave it in good condition for subsequent crops. In both respects they are preferable to any culmiferous crop.\n\nCulmiferous crops, as observed above, are not robbers when cut green: the soil, far from hardening, is kept in constant motion by the pushing of the roots, and is left more tender than if it had been left at rest without any bearing crop.\n\nBulbous-rooted plants are above all successful in dividing and pulverizing the soil. Potato-roots grow six, eight, or ten inches under the surface; and, by their size and number, they divide and pulverize the soil better than can be done by the plough; consequently, whatever be the natural colour of the soil, it is black when a potato-crop is taken up. The potato, however, with respect to its quality of dividing the soil, must yield to a carrot or parsnip; which are large roots, and pierce often to the depth of 18 inches. The turnip, by its tap-root, divides the soil more than can be done by a fibrous-rooted plant; but as its bulbous-root grows mostly above ground, it divides the soil less than the potato, the carrot, or the parsnip. Red clover, in that respect, may be put in the same class with turnip.\n\nWhether potatoes or turnip be the more gentle crop, appears a puzzling question. The former bears feed, and probably draws more nourishment from the soil than the latter, when cut green. On the other hand, potatoes divide the soil more than turnip, and leave it more loose and friable. It appears no less puzzling, to determine between cabbage and turnip: the former draws more of its nourishment from the air, the latter leaves the soil more free and open.\n\nThe result of the whole is what follows: Culmiferous plants are robbers; some more, some less: they at the same time bind the soil; some more, some less. Leguminous plants in both respects are opposite: if any of them rob the soil, it is in a very slight degree; and all of them without exception loosen the soil. A culmiferous crop, however, is generally the more profitable: but few soils can long bear the burden of such crops, unless relieved by interjected leguminous crops. These, on the other hand, without a mixture of culmiferous crops, would soon render the soil too loose.\n\nThese preliminaries will carry the farmer some length in directing a proper rotation of crops. Where dung, lime, or other manure, can be procured in plenty to recruit the soil after severe cropping, no rotation is more proper or profitable in a strong soil, than wheat, pease or beans, barley, oats, fallow. The whole farm may be brought under this rotation, except so far as hay is wanted. But as such command of manure is rare, it is of more importance to determine what should be the rotation when no manure can be procured but the dung collected in the farm. Considering that culmiferous crops are the more profitable in rich land, it would be proper to make them more frequent than the other kind. But as there are few soils in Scotland that will admit such frequent culmiferous crops without suffering, it may be laid down as a general rule, that alternate crops, culmiferous and leguminous, ought to form the rotation. Nor are there many soils that will stand good, even with this favourable rotation, unless relieved from time to time by pasturing a few years. If such extended rotation be artfully carried\nRotation of crops without end may be obtained in a tolerable good soil, without any manure but what is produced in the farm.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to be mentioned, being known to every farmer, that clay answers best for wheat, moist clay for beans, loam for barley and pease, light soil for turnip, sandy soil for rye and buckwheat; and that oats thrive better in coarse soil than any other grain. Now, in directing a rotation, it is not sufficient that a culmiferous crop be always succeeded by leguminous: attention must also be given, that no crop be introduced that is unfit for the soil. Wheat, being a great binder, requires more than any other crop a leguminous crop to follow. But every such crop is not proper: potatoes are the greatest openers of soil; but they are improper in a wheat soil. Neither will turnip answer, because it requires a light soil. A very loose soil, after a crop of rye, requires rye-grafts to bind it, or the treading of cattle in pasturing; but to bind the soil, wheat must not be ventured; for it succeeds ill in loose soil.\n\nAnother consideration of moment in directing the rotation is, to avoid crops that encourage weeds. Pease is the fittest of all crops for succeeding to wheat, because it renders the grounds loose and mellow, and the same soil agrees with both. But beware of pease, unless the soil be left by the wheat perfectly free of weeds; because pease, if not an extraordinary crop, foster weeds. Barley may be ventured after wheat, if the farmer be unwilling to lose a crop. It is indeed a robber; better, however, any crop, than run the hazard of poisoning the soil with weeds. But to prevent the necessity of barley after wheat, the land ought to be fallowed before the wheat: it cleans the ground thoroughly, and makes pease a secure crop after wheat. And after a good crop of pease, barley never fails. A horse-hoed crop of turnip is equal to a fallow for rooting out weeds; but turnip does not suit land that is proper for wheat. Cabbage does well in wheat soil; and a horse-hoed crop of cabbage, which eradicates weeds, is a good preparation for wheat to be succeeded by pease; and a crop of beans diligently hand-hoed, is in that view little inferior. As red clover requires the ground to be perfectly clean, a good crop of it injures wheat, and next pease. In loam, a drilled crop of turnip or potatoes prepares the ground, equal to a fallow, for the same succession.\n\nAnother rule is, to avoid a frequent repetition of the same species; for to produce good crops, change of species is no less necessary than change of feed. The same species returning every second or third year, will infallibly degenerate, and be a scanty crop. This is remarkably the case of red clover. Nor will our fields bear pleasantly perpetual crops of wheat after fallow, which is the practice of some English farmers.\n\nHitherto of rotation in the same field. We add one rule concerning rotation in different fields; which is, to avoid crowding crops one after another in point of time; but to choose such as admit intervals sufficient for leisurely dressing, which gives opportunity to manage all with the same hands, and with the same cattle; for example, beans in January or February, pease and oats in March, barley and potatoes in April, turnip in June or July, wheat and rye in October.\n\nFor illustrating the foregoing rules, a few instances of exceptionable rotations will not be thought amiss. The following is an usual rotation in Norfolk. First, wheat after red clover. Second, barley. Third, turnip. Fourth, barley with red clover. Fifth, clover cut for hay. Sixth, a second year's crop of clover able to be commonly pastured. Dung is given to the wheat and turnip. Against this rotation several objections lie. Barley after wheat is improper. The two crops of barley are too near together. The second crop of clover must be very bad, if pasturing be the best way of containing it; and if bad, it is a great encourager of weeds. But the strongest objection is, that red clover repeated so frequently in the same field cannot fail to degenerate; and of this the Norfolk farmers begin to be sensible. Salton in East Lothian is a clay soil; and the rotation there usually has been wheat after fallow and dung. Second, barley after two ploughings; the one before winter, the other immediately before the seed is sown. Third, oats. Fourth, pease. Fifth, barley. Sixth, oats; and then fallow. This rotation consists chiefly of robbing crops. Pease are the only leguminous crop, which, even with the fallow, is not sufficient to loosen a stiff soil. But the soil is good, which in some measure hides the badness of the rotation. About Seaton, and all the way from Preston to Gosford, the ground is still more severely handled: wheat after fallow and dung, barley oats, pease, wheat, barley, oats, and then another fallow. The soil is excellent; and it ought indeed to be so, to support many rounds of such cropping.\n\nIn the parishes of Tranent, Aberlady, Dirleton, North-Berwick, and Athelstonefoord, the following rotations were formerly universal, and to this day are much more frequent than any other mode.\n\n1. After fallow and dung, wheat, barley, oats, pease and beans, barley, oats, wheat.\n2. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, pease and beans, wheat, barley, oats, pease, wheat.\n3. After fallow and dung, wheat, oats, pease, barley, oats, wheat.\n4. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, beans, wheat, pease, barley, oats.\n\nIn the several Tours that are published by Young, are found, in the best counties of England, examples without end, of rotations no less exceptionable than many of those mentioned.\n\nWhere a field is laid down for pasture in order to be recruited, it is commonly left in that state many years; to be kept for it is the universal opinion, that the longer it lies, too long in the richer it becomes for bearing corn. This may be true; but in order to determine the mode of cropping, the important point is, what upon the whole is the most profitable rotation; not what may produce luxuriant crops at a distant period. Upon that point, it may be affirmed, that the farmer who keeps a field in pasture beyond a certain time, loses every year considerably; and that a few luxuriant crops of corn, after 20 years of pasture, and still more after 30, will not make up the loss.\n\nPasture-grafts, while young, maintain many animals; and the field is greatly recruited by what they drop; it is even recruited by hay crops, provided the grafts be cut before feeding. But as old grafts yields little profit, the field ought to be taken up for corn when the pasture begins to fail; and after a few crops, it ought\nRotation of crops to be laid down again with grass feeds. Seduced by a chimerical notion, that a field, by frequent corn crops, is fatigued, and requires rest like a labouring man or animal, careful farmers give long rest to their fields by pasture, never adverting that it affords little profit. It ought to be their study, to improve their soil, by making it free, and also retentive of moisture. If they accomplish these ends, they need not be afraid of exhausting the soil by cropping.\n\nWhere a farmer has access to no manure but what is his own production, the care under consideration, there are various rotations of crops, all of them good, though perhaps not equally so. We shall begin with two examples, one in clay and one in free soil, each of the farms 90 acres. Six acres are to be inclosed for a kitchen garden, in which there must be annually a crop of red clover, for summer food to the working cattle. As there are annually 12 acres in hay, and 12 in pasture, a single plough with good cattle will be sufficient to command the remaining 60 acres.\n\n**Rotation in a clay soil.**\n\n| Year | Crop |\n|------|------|\n| 1795 | Fallow |\n| 1796 | Wheat |\n| 1797 | Pease |\n| 1798 | Barley |\n| 1799 | Hay |\n| 1800 | Oats |\n\nWhen the rotation is completed, the seventh inclosure, having been six years in pasture, is ready to be taken up for a rotation of crops which begins with oats in the year 1801, and proceeds as in the sixth inclosure. In the same year 1801 the fifth inclosure is made pasture, for which it is prepared by sowing pasture-grass seeds with the barley of the year 1800. And in this manner may the rotation be carried on without end. Here the labour is equally distributed; and there is no hurry nor confusion. But the chief property of this rotation is, that two culmiferous or white-corn crops are never found together; by a due mixture of crops, the soil is preserved in good heart without any adventitious manure. At the same time, the land is always producing plentiful crops: neither hay nor pasture get time to degenerate. The whole dung is laid upon the fallow.\n\nEvery farm that takes a grass crop into the rotation must be inclosed, which is peculiarly necessary in a clay soil, as nothing is more hurtful to clay than poaching.\n\n**Rotation in a free soil.**\n\n| Year | Crop |\n|------|------|\n| 1795 | Turnip |\n| 1796 | Barley |\n| 1797 | Hay |\n| 1798 | Oats |\n| 1799 | Fallow |\n| 1800 | Wheat |\n\nFor the next rotation, the seventh inclosure is taken up for corn, beginning with an oat crop, and proceeding in the order of the fourth inclosure; in place of which, the third inclosure is laid down for pasture by sowing pasture-grass with the last crop in that inclosure, being barley. This rotation has all the advantages of the former. Here the dung is employed on the turnip crop.\n\nWe proceed to consider what rotation is proper for clay soil. The farm we propose consists of 73 acres. Nine are to be inclosed for a kitchen garden, affording plenty of red clover to be cut green for the farm cattle. The remaining 64 acres are divided into four inclosures, 16 acres each, to be cropped as in the following table:\n\n| Inclosure | Year |\n|-----------|------|\n| 1         | Beans |\n| 2         | Barley |\n| 3         | Hay   |\n| 4         | Oats  |\n\nHere the dung ought to be applied to the barley.\n\nMany other rotations may be contrived, keeping to the rules above laid down. Fallow, for example, wheat, peas, and beans, barley, cabbage, oats, for clay. Here dung must be given both to the wheat and cabbage. For free soil, drilled turnip, barley, red clover, wheat upon a single furrow, drilled potatoes, oats. Both the turnip and potatoes must have dung. Another for free soil: turnip drilled and dugged, red clover, wheat on a single furrow with dung, pease, barley, potatoes, oats. The following rotation has proved successful in a soil proper for wheat.\n\n1. Oats with red clover, after fallow without dung.\n2. Hay. The clover stubble dugged, and wheat sown the end of October with a single furrow.\n3. Wheat.\n4. Pease.\n5. Barley. Fallow again.\n6. Oats are taken the first crop, to save the dung for the wheat. Oats always thrive on a fallow, though without dung, which is not the case of barley. But barley seldom fails after pease.\n\nIn strong clay soil, the following rotation answers:\n\n1. Wheat after fallow and dung.\n2. Beans sown under furrow as early as possible.\n3. Above the beans, sow pease end of March, half a boll per acre, and harrow them in.\n4. The two grains will ripen at the same time.\n5. Oats or barley on a winter furrow with grass-seeds.\n6. Hay for one year or two; the second growth pastured.\n7. Lay what dung can be spared on the hay-stubble, and sow wheat with a single furrow.\n8. Wheat.\n9. Beans or pease.\n10. Oats. Fallow again.\n\nIn addition to these, we shall here state from the Agricultural Survey of Yorkshire, an example of a rotation used in that county upon a marl-land farm consisting of 432 acres of arable land, in which a very great number of hands and horses appear to have been employed, but in which very valuable products are reared. \"The soil, where the principal part of the potatoes are grown, is a good warp; the other part on which potatoes are also cultivated, a mixture of warp and land; the remainder of the land, clay, with a small portion of warp, but too strong to grow potatoes, except about 70 acres, which is tolerably good potato-land.\"\nReaping land, but at too great a distance from the river.

We must observe, he fallows his land very often; yet he is well paid by his superior crops. The last year (1795) he had 100 sacks per acre off most of his potato-land; and sold them from 8s. to 12s. per sack of 14 pecks. All their corn is sold by the quarter of eight Winchester bushels, though I believe their measure rather overruns.\"\n\nSect. VI. Of Reaping Corn and Hay Crops, and Storing them up for Use.\n\nCulmiferous plants are ripe when the stem is totally white: they are not fully ripe if any green streaks remain. Some farmers are of opinion, that wheat ought to be cut before it is fully ripe. Their reasons are, first, that ripe wheat is apt to shatter; and next, that the flour is not so good. With respect to the latter, it is contrary to nature, that any feed can be better in an unripe state than when brought to perfection; nor will it be found so upon trial. With respect to the first, wheat, at the point of perfection, is not more apt to shatter than for some days before: the bulk begins not to open till after the seed is fully ripe; and then the sufferings the crop to stand becomes ticklish; after the minute of ripening, it should be cut down in an instant, if possible.\n\nThis leads to the hands that are commonly engaged Of reapers, to cut down corn. In Scotland, the universal practice was, to provide a number of hands, in proportion to the extent of the crop, without regard to the time of ripening. By this method, the reapers were often idle for want of work; and what is much worse, they had often more work than they could overtake, and ripe fields were laid open to shaking winds. The Lothians have long enjoyed weekly markets for reapers, where a farmer can provide himself with the number he wants; and this practice is creeping into neighbouring shires. Where there is no opportunity of such markets, neighbouring farmers ought to agree in borrowing and lending their reapers.\n\nOne should imagine, that a caution against cutting corn when wet is unnecessary; yet from the impatience of farmers to prevent shattering, no caveat is more so. Why do they not consider, that corn standing dries in half a day? when, in a clove sheaf, the weather must be favourable if it dry in a month? in moist weather it will never dry.\n\nWith respect to the manner of cutting, we must pre. Manner of mile, that barley is of all the most difficult grain to be cutting, dried for keeping. Having no husk, rain has an easy access; and it has a tendency to malt when wet. Where the ground is properly smoothed by rolling, it seems best to cut it down with the scythe. This manner being more expeditious than the sickle, removes it sooner from danger of wind; and gives a third more straw, which is a capital article for dung, where a farm is at a distance from other manure. We except only corn that has lodged; for there the sickle is more convenient than the scythe. As it ought to be dry when cut, bind it up directly: if allowed to lie any time in the swath, it is apt to be discoloured.—Barley sown with grass-seeds, red clover especially, requires a different management. Where the grass is cut along with it, the difficulty is great of getting it so dry as to be ventured in a stack. The best way is, to cut the barley with a sickle above the clover, so as that nothing but clean barley is bound up. Cut with a scythe the stubble and grass: they make excellent winter food. The same method is applicable to oats; with this only difference, that when the field is exposed to the south-west wind, it is less necessary to bind immediately after mowing. As wheat commonly grows higher than any other grain, it is difficult to manage it with the scythe; for which reason the sickle is preferred in England. Pease and beans grow so irregularly, as to make the sickle necessary.\n\nThe best way for drying pease, is to keep separate Drying of the handfuls that are cut; though in this way they wet pease easily, they dry as soon. In the common way of heap-\nReaping peafe together for composing a sheaf, they wet as easily, and dry not near so soon. With respect to beans, the top of the handful last cut ought to be laid on the bottom of the former, which gives ready access to the wind. By this method peafe and beans are ready for the stack in half the ordinary time.\n\nA sheaf commonly is made as large as can be contained in two lengths of the corn made into a rope. To save frequent tying, the binder presses it down with his knee, and binds it so hard as totally to exclude the air. If there be any moisture in the crop, which seldom fails, a process of fermentation and putrefaction commences in the sheaf; which is perfected in the stack, to the destruction both of corn and straw. How fluid is it, to make the size of a sheaf depend on the height of the plants! By that rule, a wheat sheaf is commonly too weighty, as to be unmanageable by ordinary arms: it requires an effort to move it that frequently buries the knot, and occasions loss of grain, beside the trouble of a second tying. Sheaves ought never to be larger than can be contained in one length of the plant, cut close to the ground; without admitting any exception, if the plants be above 18 inches high. The binder's arm can then compress the sheaf sufficiently without need of his knee. The additional hands that this way of binding may require, are not to be regarded compared with the advantage of drying soon. Corn thus managed may be ready for the stack in a week; it seldom in the ordinary way requires less than a fortnight, and frequently longer. Of a small sheaf compressed by the arm only, the air pervades every part; nor is it so apt to be unloosed as a large sheaf, however firmly bound. We omit the gathering of sheaves into shocks, because the common method is good, which is to place the shocks directed to the south-west, in order to resist the force of the wind. Five sheaves on each side make a sufficient stay; and a greater number cannot be covered with two head-sheaves.\n\nEvery article is of importance that hastens the operation in a country, like Scotland, subjected to unequal harvest weather; for which reason, the most expeditious method should be chosen for carrying corn from the field to the stack-yard. Our carriages are generally too small or too large. A fledge is a very awkward machine: many hands are required, and little progress made. Waggon and large carts are little less dilatory, as they must stand in the yard till unloaded sheaf by sheaf. The best way is, to use long carts moveable upon the axle, so as at once to throw the whole load on the ground; which is forked up to the stack by a hand appointed for that purpose. By this method, two carts will do the work of four or five.\n\nBuilding round stacks in the yard is undoubtedly preferable to housing corn. There it is shut up from the air; and it must be exceedingly dry, if it contract not a mildew, which is the first step to putrefaction. Add to this, that in the yard, a stack is preserved from rats and mice, by being set on a pedestal; whereas no method has hitherto been invented for preserving corn in a house from such destructive vermin. The proper manner of building, is to make every sheaf incline downward from its top to its bottom. Where the sheaves are laid horizontally, the stack will take in rain both above and below. The best form of a stack is that of a cone placed on a cylinder; and the top of the cone should be formed with three sheaves drawn to a point. If the upper part of the cylinder be a little wider than the under, so much the better.\n\nThe delaying to cover a stack for two or three weeks, though common, is, however, exceeding absurd; for if much rain fall in the interim, it is beyond covering the power of wind to dry the stack. Vegetation begins in the external parts, shuts out the air from the internal; and to prevent a total putrefaction, the stack must be thrown down and exposed to the air every sheaf. In order to have a stack covered the moment it is finished, straw and ropes ought to be ready; and the covering ought to be so thick as to be proof against rain.\n\nScotland is subject not only to floods of rain, but to high winds. Good covering guards against the former, and ropes artfully applied guard against the latter. The following is a good mode. Take a hay-rope well twisted, and surround the stack with it, two feet or so below the top. Surround the stack with another such rope immediately below the eaves. Connect these two with ropes in an up-and-down position, distant from each other at the eaves about five or six feet. Then surround the stack with other circular ropes parallel to the two first mentioned, giving them a twist round every one of those that lie up and down, by which the whole will be connected together in a sort of net-work. What remains is, to finish the two feet at the top of the stack. Let it be covered with bunches of straw laid regularly up and down; the under part to be put under the circular rope first mentioned, which will keep it fast, and the upper part be bound by a small rope artfully twisted, commonly called the crown of the stack. This method is preferable to the common way of laying long ropes over the top of the stack, and tying them to the belting-ropes; which flattens the top, and makes it take in rain. A stack covered in the way here described, will stand two years secured both against wind and rain; a notable advantage in this variable climate.\n\nThe great aim in making hay is, to preserve as much Hay-maize of the sap as possible. All agree in this; and yet differing widely in the means of making that aim effectual. To describe all the different means would be equally tedious and unprofitable. We shall confine ourselves to two, which appear preferable to all others. A crop of rye-grafs and yellow clover ought to be spread as cut. A day or two after, when the dew is evaporated, rake it into a number of parallel rows along the field, termed windrows, for the convenience of putting it up into small cocks. After turning the rows once and again, make small cocks weighing a stone or two. At the distance of two days or so, put two cocks into one, observing always to mix the tops and bottoms together, and to take a new place for each cock, that the least damage possible may be done to the grafts. Proceed in putting two cocks into one, till sufficiently dry for tramp-ricks of 100 stone each. The easiest way of erecting tramp-ricks, is to found a rick in the middle of the row of cocks that are to compose it. The cocks may be carried to the rick by two persons joining arms together. When all the cocks are thus carried to the rick within the distance of 40 yards or so, the rest of the cocks will be more expeditiously carried to the rick, by a rope wound about them and dragged by a horse.\nReaping horse. Two ropes are sufficient to secure the ricks from wind the short time they are to stand in the field.\n\nIn the year 1773, 10,000 stone were put into tramp-ricks the fourth day after cutting. In a country so wet as many parts of Scotland are, expedition is of mighty consequence in the drying both of hay and corn. With respect to hay intended for horned cattle, it is by the generality held an improvement, that it be heated a little in the stack. But we violently suspect this doctrine to have been invented for excluding indolent management. An ox, it is true, will eat such hay; but it will always be found that he prefers sweet hay; and it cannot well be doubted, but that such hay is the most salutary and the most nourishing.\n\nThe making hay consisting chiefly of red clover, requires more care. The season of cutting is the last week of June, when it is in full bloom; earlier it may be cut, but never later. To cut it later would indeed produce a weightier crop; but a late first cutting makes the second also late, perhaps too late for drying. At the same time, the want of weight in an early first cutting, is amply compensated by the weight of the second.\n\nWhen the season is too variable for making hay of the second growth, mix straw with that growth, which will be a substantial food for cattle during winter. This is commonly done by laying strata of the straw and clover alternately in the stack. But by this method, the strata of clover, if they do not heat, turn mouldy at least, and unpalatable. The better way is, to mix them carefully with the hand before they be put into the stack. The dry straw imbibes moisture from the clover and prevents heating.\n\nBut the best method of hay-making seems to be that recommended by Mr. Anderson*. Instead (says he), of allowing the hay to lie, as usual in most places, for some days in the swath after it is cut, and afterwards alternately putting it up into cocks and spreading it out, and tedding it in the sun, which tends greatly to bleach the hay, exhales its natural juices, and subjects it very much to the danger of getting rain, and thus runs a great risk of being good for little. I make it a general rule, if possible, never to cut hay but when the grass is quite dry; and then make the gatherers follow close upon the cutters, putting it up immediately into small cocks about three feet high each when new put up, and of as small a diameter as they can be made to stand with; always giving each of them a flight kind of thatching, by drawing a few handfuls of the hay from the bottom of the cock all around, and laying it lightly upon the top with one of the ends hanging downwards. This is done with the utmost ease and expedition; and when it is once in that state, I consider my hay as in a great measure out of danger: for unless a violent wind should arise immediately after the cocks are put up, so as to overturn them, nothing else can hurt the hay; as I have often experienced, that no rain, however violent, ever penetrates into these cocks but for a very little way. And, if they are dry put up, they never fit together so closely as to store heat; although they acquire, in a day or two, such a degree of firmness, as to be in no danger of being overturned by wind after that time, unless it blows a hurricane.\n\nIn these cocks I allow the hay to remain, until, upon inspection, I judge that it will keep in pretty large tramp-cocks (which is usually in one or two weeks, according as the weather is more or less favourable), when two men, each with a long pronged pitchfork, lift up one of these small cocks between them with the greatest ease, and carry them one after another to the place where the tramp-cock is to be built (i): and in this manner they proceed over the field till the whole is finished.\n\nThe advantages that attend this method of making hay, are, that it greatly abridges the labour; as, of course, it does not require above the one-half of the work that method is necessary in the old method of turning and tedding it: That it allows the hay to continue almost as green as when it is cut, and preserves its natural juices in the greatest perfection; for, unless it be the little that is exposed to the sun and air upon the surface of the cocks, which is no more bleached than every straw of hay saved in the ordinary way, the whole is dried in the most slow and equal manner that could be desired; and, lastly, that it is thus in a great measure secured from almost the possibility of being damaged by rain. This last circumstance deserves to be much more attended to by the farmer than it usually is at present; as I have seen few who are sufficiently aware of the loss that the quality of their hay suffers by receiving a flight shower after it is cut, and before it is gathered; the generality of farmers seeming to be very well satisfied if they get in their hay without being absolutely rotted, never paying the least attention to its having been several times wetted while the hay was making. But, if these gentlemen will take the trouble at any time to compare any parcel of hay that has been made perfectly dry, with another parcel from the same field that has received a shower while in the swath, or even a copious dew, they will soon be sensible of a very manifest difference between them; nor will their horses or cattle ever commit a mistake in choosing between the two.\n\nLet it be particularly remarked, that in this particular manner of making hay, great care must be taken that it be caution ready when first put into the cocks; for if it is in the slightest degree wet at that time, it will turn instantly mouldy, and fit together so as to become totally impervious to the air, and will never afterwards become dry till it is spread out to the sun. For this reason, if at any time during a course of good settled weather you should begin to cut in the morning before the dew is off the grass, keep back the gatherers till the dew is evaporated; allowing that which was first cut to lie till it is dry before it is cocked. In this case, you will almost\n\n(1) If the hay is to be carried to any considerable distance, this part of the labour may be greatly abridged; by causing the carriers take two long sticks of a sufficient length, and having laid them down by the small cocks parallel to one another, at the distance of one and a half, or two feet asunder, let them lift three or four cocks, one after another, and place them carefully above the sticks, and then carry them altogether, as if upon a handbarrow, to the place where the large rick is to be built.\nmost always find that the uncut gras will dry sooner than that which has been cut when wet; and, therefore, the gatherers may always begin to put up that which is fresh cut before the other; which will usually require two or three hours to dry after the new-cut hay may be cocked. And if, at any time, in case of necessity, you should be obliged to cut your hay before it is dry, the same rule must be observed always to allow it to remain in the swath till it is quite dry: but, as there is always a great risk of being long in getting it up, and as it never in this case wins (x) so kindly as if it had been dry cut, the farmer ought to endeavour, if possible, in all cases, to cut his hay only when dry; even if it should cost him some additional expense to the cutters, by keeping them employed at any other work, or even allowing them to remain idle, if the weather should be variable or rainy.\n\n\"But if there is a great proportion of clover, and the weather should chance to be close and calm at the time, it may, on some occasions, be necessary to open up these cocks a little, to admit some fresh air into them; in which case, after they have stood a day or two, it may be of great use to turn these cocks and open them up a little, which ought to be done in the driest time of the day; the operator taking that part of each cock which was the top, and with it forming the base of a new one; so that the part which was most exposed to the air becomes excluded from it, and that which was undermost comes to be placed upon the top, so as to make it all dry as equally as possible.\n\n\"If the hay has not been damp when it was first put up, the cock may be immediately finished out at once; but if it is at all wet, it will be of great use to turn over only a little of the top of the cock at first, and leaving it in that state to dry a little, proceed to another, and a third, and fourth, &c., treating each in the same way; going on in that manner till you find that the inside of the first opened cock is sufficiently dried, when it will be proper to return to it, turning over a little more of it till you come to what is still damp, when you leave it and proceed to another, and so on round the whole; always returning afresh till the cocks are entirely finished. This is the best way of saving your hay, if you have been under the necessity of cutting it while damp; but it is always best to guard against this inconvenience, if possible.\"\n\nIn the yard, a stack of hay bought to be an oblong square, if the quantity be greater than to be easily stowed in a round stack; because a smaller surface is exposed to the air than in a number of round stacks. For the same reason, a stack of peat ought to have the same form, the straw being more valuable than that of oats, wheat, or barley. The moment a stack is finished it ought to be covered; because the surface hay is much damaged by withering in dry weather, and moistening in wet weather. Let it have a pavilion-roof; for more of it can be covered with straw in that shape, than when built perpendicular at the ends. Let it be roped as directed above for corn-flacks; with this difference only, that in an oblong square the ropes must be thrown over the top, and tied to the belt-rope below. This belt-rope ought to be fixed with pins to the flack; the reason is, that the ropes thrown over the flack will bag by the sinking of the flack, and may be drawn tight by lowering the belt rope, and fixing it in its new position with the same pins.\n\nThe stems of hops, being long and tough, make excellent ropes; and it will be a saving article, to propagate a few plants of that kind for that very end.\n\nA flack of rye-grass hay, a year old, and of a moderate size, will weigh, each cubic yard, 11 Dutch stone. A flack of clover-hay in the same circumstances weighs somewhat less.\n\n**Sect. VII. Manures.**\n\n\"The use of manures (says M. Parmentier*), has * Memoirs been known in all ages; but we are yet far from having any clear and precise ideas of the nature of the juices of Agriculture, which are destined for the nourishment of vegetables, Paris, and of the manner in which they are transmitted to their organs. The writers on agriculture, who have endeavoured to explain these matters, perceiving faults in most opinions, were persuaded that these faults, by the help of concerning water and heat, passed, in a saline form, through the manure, vegetable filter. These first philosophers did not hesitate to consider every thing that has been done by the industry of man, to improve the nature of land, and its productions, as merely forming reservoirs of these faults, which they considered as the principle of fertility. This opinion was so well established among the improvers of land, that, to this day, many of them have no object in view, in their operations, but to disengage faults; and, when they attempt to explain certain phenomena which take place in their fields or orchards, they talk confidently about the nature of the air, of rain, of snow, of dew, and fogs; of the faults of the earth, of dung, of marl, of lime, of chalk, &c., and make use of those vague terms, oil, sulphur, spirit, &c., which ought henceforward to be banished from our elementary books on agriculture.\n\n\"Among the authors who have attacked, and combated with most success, the opinion that the fruitfulness of soils, and the aliment of vegetables, reside in saline substances, must be reckoned Eller and Wallerius. These philosophers examined, by every means which chemistry at that time could furnish, the various kinds of earth proper for cultivation, and also those substances which have always been considered as the most powerful manures, without being able to obtain, from any of them, anything more than mere atoms of salt.\n\n\"Animated with the same zeal, and taking advantage of the instructions found in their writings, I thought it necessary to determine, by experience, whether, as has been asserted, there really exist neutral faults in earths; and also, whether those earths are more fertile in proportion to the quantity of such faults they contain. With this view, I lixiviated, by means of distilled water, many species of cultivated earths, taken in various states, from fresh earth to that which had\n\n(x) By winning hay, is meant the operation by which it is brought from the succulent state of gras to that of a dry fodder.\nhad been impoverished by the growth of several crops; I also tried dung, reduced more or less into the state of mould; and likewise the most active manures, such as the offal of animal substances rotted by putrefaction; but in none of these, however carefully analyzed, were found any salts in a free state. They contain indeed the materials proper for forming salts, but if they contain any ready formed, it is merely by accident.\n\n\"The researches of Kraft, and those of Alton, were not attended with different results. Having sown some oats in ashes, not lixiviated, and in sand strongly impregnated with potash and with saltpetre, and having found that the oats did not grow, they concluded that neutral salts, and alkalies, not only retarded the growth of vegetables, but that they absolutely prevented it. It is well known that in Egypt there are districts where the earth is entirely covered with sea-salt, and these districts are quite barren. It is probably owing to this property of sea-salt, that the Romans were accustomed to scatter large quantities of it over fields where any great crime had been committed, and of which they wished to perpetuate the remembrance, by rendering the part barren for a certain time.\n\n\"The idea that salts had great influence in vegetation ought to have been greatly weakened by the following simple reflection. Supposing that salts existed in garden-mould, they would be very soon dissolved by the rain, and carried away, towards the lower strata of the earth, to a depth to which the longest roots would not reach. Indeed the famous experiment of Van Helmont would have been sufficient to have destroyed the above opinion, if it did not generally happen that we are no sooner set free from one error than we fall into another not less extraordinary. The surprising effects of vegetation brought about by the overflowing of water, and in the neighbourhood of salt marshes, and the infinite number of inhaling capillary tubes observed upon the surface of vegetables, led to an opinion that the air and water, absorbed by the roots and leaves of plants, were only vehicles loaded with saline matter, analogous to the vegetables nourished by them.\n\n\"To the experiment of Van Helmont, which was repeated by many accurate observers, succeeded those of modern philosophers; from which it clearly appeared, that plants could grow, and produce fruit, in the air of the atmosphere, and in distilled water, also in pure sand, in powdered glass, in wet moss or sponge, in the cavity of flinty roots, &c., and that plants which had nothing but the above-mentioned fluids for their nourishment, gave, when submitted to chemical analysis, the same products as those which had undergone their processes of vegetation in a soil perfectly well manured. It was also observed, that the most barren soils were rendered fertile when they were properly supplied with water by canals; and the efficacy of irrigation was repeatedly evinced in different ways: from these observations was formed the following system, that water rises in plants in the form of vapour, as in distillation; that air introduces itself into their pores; and that, if salts contribute to the fruitfulness of soils, it is only in consequence of their containing the two fluids above mentioned in great abundance.\"\n\nOur author, after making many experiments upon various soils and salts, maintains \"that saline substances have no sensible effects in promoting vegetation, except inasmuch as they are of a deliquescent nature, have an earthy basis easily decomposed, and are used only in small quantity. In those circumstances they have the power of attracting, from the immense reservoir of the atmosphere, the vapours which circulate in it; these vapours they retain, along with the moisture that is produced from rain, snow, dew, fog, &c., which moisture they prevent from running together in a mass, or from being lost, either by exhaling into the air of the atmosphere, or by filtering itself through the inferior strata of the earth, and thereby leaving the roots of vegetables dry; they distribute that moisture uniformly, and transmit it, in a state of great division, to the orifices of the tubes destined to carry it into the texture of the plant, where it is afterwards to undergo the laws of assimilation. As every kind of vegetable manure possesses a viscid kind of moisture, it thereby partakes of the property of deliquescent salts. In short, the preparation of land for vegetation has no other object in view but to divide the earthy particles, to soften them, and to give them a form capable of producing the above-mentioned effects. It is sufficient, therefore, that water, by its mixture with the earth and the manure, be divided, and spread out so as to be applied only by its surface, and that it keep the root of the plant always wet, without drowning it, in order to become the essential principle of vegetation. But as plants which grow in the shade, even in the best soil, are weakly, and as the greater part of those which are made to grow in a place that is perfectly dark, neither give fruit nor flowers, it cannot be denied, that the influence of the sun is of great importance in vegetable economy.\"\n\nSuch was the opinion of M. Parmentier while the old theory of chemistry prevailed; but when it appeared, by more recent discoveries, that air and water are not simple but compound bodies, made up of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote, and that they are resolved into these principles by many operations of nature and of art, he so far altered his theory of vegetation as to admit, that air and water act their part in that process, not in a compound state, but by means of the principles of which they consist. He now concluded, that the value of manured earth consists of its tendency to resolve water into gasses which give out heat while they are absorbed by the plants. As he thus supposes that the gasses constitute the food of plants, it follows, that the most aerated waters will be the most favourable to vegetation; and hence arises the value of those in which putrid animal matters are dissolved. Salts and dung act as leavens in bringing on a state of fermentation in the substances with which they are mingled, and operating the decomposition of water, which, along with the carbon existing in the atmosphere, he imagines contains the whole materials of the more simple vegetables. Too great a quantity of salts prevents fermentation, or the decomposition of water, and hence is prejudicial to vegetation, while a small quantity is more advantageous, as more favourable to that process of putrefaction. Different manures also give forth gasses which are absorbed by plants, and give them a peculiarity of character: hence, in a soil composed of mud and dung, cabbages acquire a bad taste, from the hepatic gas, or sulphurated hydrogen gas, which is there evolved. In addition to these chemical properties,\nManures, properties of manure, it also, by its mechanical qualities, renders the soil more permeable to water and to the roots of the plants, and is thus favourable to the process of vegetation. At the same time, as the earths themselves have a chemical action upon water, and are capable of affording a proper basis for plants, he considers them as in many cases sufficient to promote vegetation. Upon these principles, M. Parmentier takes a view of different substances used as manures.\n\nMarl, in his opinion, is capable of acting in the same manner as the most fertile soil, when the principles of which it is composed, namely, clay, sand, calcareous earth, and magnesian earth, are justly proportioned to each other. But it is sometimes compact and tenacious, because it contains a superabundant portion of clay, and at other times porous and friable, because it contains too much sand, and therefore is not in general fit for vegetation by itself. These considerations ought always to be our guide when we mean to employ marl as a manure.\n\nIt has been supposed that to marl is a sort of technical expression, intended to denote the bringing together or dividing the earthy particles by means of clay or sand. It appears to our author, that neither of the above operations can properly be called marling; because, in either case, all we do is, to put the soil into a situation to receive and to profit by the influence of the atmosphere, and that of the manures made use of. The peculiar principle of marl is, that part of it which, like lime, acts very powerfully upon the different aeriform fluids, is easily reduced to powder, effervesces with acids, and sends forth a quantity of air-bubbles when water is poured upon it. Now this matter, which in a particular manner does the office of manure, resides neither in clay nor in sand. Upon the proportion of it depends the duration of the fertility it produces; consequently it is of importance, when we make use of marl, to know which of its constituent parts it contains in the greatest proportion, otherwise in some cases we should only add one common kind of earth to another. Hence our author infers, that for a chalky soil clay is the proper manure, and that in such a soil a clay bottom is of more value than a gold mine.\n\nWood-ashes, as a manure, may be, in some respects, compared to marl; at least they contain the same earth as those which generally enter into the composition of marl, but they contain a greater quantity of saline substances, proceeding from the vegetables of which they are the residue, and from the process made use of in their combustion; a process which increases their activity, and should render us careful in what manner and for what purposes we employ them. Wood-ashes, when scattered over fields, at proper times and in proper quantities, destroy weeds, and encourage the vegetation of good plants. But do the ashes produce this effect by a sort of corrosive power? I cannot (says our author) think it; for in that case all kinds of plants would indiscriminately be acted upon by them, and to a certain degree destroyed.\n\nBesides, the ashes of fresh wood are seldom employed until they have been lixiviated; in which state they are deprived of their caustic principle; those ashes which are most commonly made use of for manure are produced either from wood that has been floated in water, or from turf, or from pit-coal, and contain little Manures, or no alkaline salt.\n\nIt appears much more probable that ashes, when laid upon ground, destroy the weeds by a well known effect, namely, by feeding with eagerness that moisture which serves to produce those weeds, and which in a superabundant quantity is necessary to their existence and support. Whereas those plants which have a firmer texture and a longer root, which are rendered strong by age and by having withstood the rigour of winter, and which are in fact the plants of which the fields are composed, do not suffer any damage from the application of the ashes; but, on the contrary, by being freed from the superfluous weeds which stifled them, and robbed them of a part of their sustenance, they receive a quantity of nourishment proportioned to their wants. The state of relaxation and languor to which they were reduced by a superabundance of water, leaves them, the soil gets its proper consistence, and the grass, corn, &c., acquiring the strength and vigour which is natural to them, soon overcome the mists, rushes, and other weeds; thus a good crop, of whatever the field consists of, is produced. It is in the above manner that wood ashes act, whenever in the spring it is necessary to apply them to meadows, corn fields, &c., the plants of which are stifled and weakened by a luxuriant vegetation of weeds, the usual consequence of mild and wet winters.\n\nWhen wood-ashes produce an effect different from what is above described, it is either because they happen to contain too much alkaline salt, or that they are laid on the ground in too great quantity, or that the fields to which they are applied were not sufficiently wet to restrain their action; for when they are scattered upon cold soils, and buried by the plough before the time of sowing, they are, like lime, of great service. The last-mentioned substance is very efficacious in other circumstances; and there is a well known method of using it practised by the Germans, as follows: A heap of lime is formed by the side of a heap of poor earth, and water is poured upon the lime; the earth is then thrown over it, and becomes impregnated with the vapours which escape from the lime while it is flaked. The earth, after being thus aerated, may be separated; and although no lime remains mixed with it, it is, by the operation just described, rendered capable of giving a luxuriant vegetation to whatever plants may be put into it.\n\nIt is possible, therefore, to aerate earth as well as fluids; for this purpose, by mixing it with certain substances during their decomposition, we must attach to it the principles of which those substances are composed; from which there results a matter so loaded with gas, as to form a more compound substance, and one which has acquired new properties. The Arabians, for example, who take great pains to improve their land, are accustomed to make large pits, which they fill with animals which happen to die; these pits they afterwards cover with calcareous or clayey earth; and after some time these earths, which of themselves are sterile, acquire the properties of the richest manures.\n\nThe foregoing observations may at least be considered as proving, that those substances which, when employed fresh and in too great quantity, are most prejudicial to vegetation, have, on the contrary, an advantageous\nManures, tageous effect, when they are previously made to undergo a fermentation; or when they are mixed with earth or water, in a proportion adapted to the end proposed. The grass of fields in which cattle or poultry go to feed, after the first or second crop of hay, appears to be dried by the urine and dung of those animals, as if fire had been applied to it; whereas these same excrementitious substances, when combined with earth, or diluted with water, are capable, without any other preparation, of performing the office of good manure.\n\n\"But if animal fecal substances, when applied in substance to plants, were capable of acting upon them, as is affirmed, in such a way as to corrode or burn them, how could feed which has been swallowed, and escaped the action of the digestive powers, be prolific when thrown out by the animal, after having remained so long in its dung? yet we often see oats, in circumstanced, grow and produce seed. Is it not more consistent with experience and observation to suppose, that these excrementitious substances, being still endowed with animal heat, and with an organic motion, diffuse round plants in vegetation a deleterious principle or inflammable gas, which destroys them? for soon after their application, the foliage of the plant grows yellow, dries up, and the plant withers, unless there happens a shower of rain which revives it. When these substances are diluted, by being mixed with water and earth, they lose that principle which is so destructive to vegetable life, and an incipient fermentation augments their power as a manure, so that they may be immediately made use of without any apprehension of injury from their effects.\n\n\"It appears, therefore, that any operation upon excrementitious substances, by which they are dried and reduced to powder, cannot be practised without depriving those substances of a great part of such of their principles as are easily evaporated, and upon which their fluidity depends; these principles, when diluted with water, and confined by being mixed with earth, are capable of increasing the produce of the soil. Such is the way in which the husbandmen in Flanders make use of this kind of manure, in the cultivation of a kind of rape or cole seed, which is to them a very important branch of agricultural industry and commerce; and they never observe that the sap carries up any of those principles which give such manure its offensive smell; nor do they observe, that the fodder produced from fields so manured, whether eaten fresh or dry, is disagreeable to their cattle. The excrements of all animals would be injurious to plants, if applied too fresh, or in too great quantity; and a gardener could not commit a greater fault, than to put more than a certain quantity of them into the water he means to make use of to water his young plants; in short, this kind of manure is to be used in a very sparing manner; and he that is too prodigal of it will find, to his cost, that excess, even of that which is otherwise beneficial, becomes an evil.\n\n\"It must certainly be allowed, that excrementitious substances are a very advantageous manure for cold soils, and suited to most vegetable productions; a long experience of their effects over a large tract of country, and the acknowledged intelligence of the Flemish farmers, ought to be considered as sufficient to overcome the prejudice that has been raised against this sort of manure. Supposing that the bad effects which have been attributed to it, when used in the state in which Manures, it is taken out of privies, &c., are not the offspring of a prejudiced imagination, they may have arisen from its having been made use of at an improper time, or in too great quantity; or from its having been applied to a foil and for the cultivation of plants to which it was not adapted; for we know that the excess of any kind of manure changes the smell and taste of plants, and the same effect is produced by watering them too frequently. Striking examples of this change are seen in the strawberry and in the violet, when such as have grown in the woods are compared to those produced from some of our over-manured gardens; also in the lettuce, and some other plants, when those raised for sale by the gardeners about Paris are compared to those of some particular kitchen gardens. In the markets of some cities, the carrots, turnips, and potatoes of the fields, are preferred to the same kind of roots cultivated by the gardeners; for though the last are of a larger size, they have not so good a flavour. Some vegetables, therefore, are like certain wild species of the animal kingdom; they resist every kind of culture, as those animals resist every effort to tame them.\n\n\"Although experience has taught the Flemish farmers, that excrementitious substances are more active in their natural state than when dried, yet it cannot be denied that drying them, and reducing them into powder, is sometimes very advantageous, because in that state they are much less offensive, are easily transported to any distance, and may be used when most convenient or most proper. In many cities the inhabitants pay to have their privies emptied: in other places, those who empty them pay for their contents; and it would astonish any one to be told how great a revenue is produced in the city of Lille in Flanders by the sale of this kind of manure. I am, however (says our author), far from thinking that it is right, in all cases, to employ it in the above-mentioned state of concentration; it would be better, in my opinion, to follow the example of the Flemish farmers, who use it the first year for the cultivation of plants for oil, or for hemp or flax; and the second year for the best kinds of grain: thus obtaining two crops, instead of one, without any further preparation of the land. What is said above may be applied also to the manures produced from the dung of cattle, poultry, &c. (particularly to pigeons' dung, the most powerful manure of its kind), all which, by being dried and powdered before they are used, lose a great portion of their activity. From these observations another fact may be deduced, namely, that manure should not be taken from the place where it has been thrown together until the season of the year and the state of the land are such that it may be put into the ground as soon as it is brought to it. In some districts a very injurious custom prevails of carrying the manure into the fields, and leaving it there formed into small heaps, exposed for some days to the elements; during which time, either the sun and wind dry up its natural moisture, leaving a mass which is much less active; or the rain dissolves and carries away the extractive part impregnated with the salt. This kind of brine, which is the most powerful part of the manure, penetrates the earth to a considerable depth, and thaws (by the thick tufts which arise in those places, and which produce more straw than grain) that manure...\"\nought to be put into the ground as soon as it is brought to it, because it then possesses its full force and effect, and consequently would be then used to the greatest advantage.\n\n\"We have always at hand the means of composing, from a great variety of vegetable and animal substances, such manures as, when brought into a proper state, and mixed with land, contribute to its fertility. Chemistry also offers us a number of substances, which, although when used separately they tend to diminish the fertilizing quality of the earth, are yet capable, by being combined, of forming excellent manures; such, for instance, is that saponaceous combination which is produced from a mixture of potash, oil, and earth. What an advantage it would be, if, instead of being sparing of manure, the inhabitants of the country would endeavour to increase the number of these resources, and to render them more beneficial, by employing them in a more effectual manner! How many years had passed before it was known that the refuse of apples and pears, after they are pressed (and which used to be thrown away as useless), is capable of forming as valuable a manure, in cider and perry countries, as the refuse of grapes does in wine countries!\"\n\nFrom what has been observed, our author concludes, that manures act, in many circumstances, like medicines, and consequently that the same sort of manure cannot be adapted to every situation, and every kind of soil; we must therefore take care to make proper distinctions between them. Whoever shall pretend that any particular kind of manure may be used, with equal benefit, in grass land, corn fields, vineyards, orchards, kitchen gardens, &c., ought to be classed amongst those quacks who undertake to cure all persons with the same remedy, without any regard to their age, constitution, &c. It is probably from not having paid sufficient attention to the aforementioned distinctions, that some authors have found fault with particular manures, while others have spoken too highly in their favour.\n\nHaving thus far stated the observations of this ingenious author, we think it necessary to remark, that the practical farmer, who wishes to advance safely and prosperously in his occupation, will probably find, that the best principle upon which he can proceed in forming his plans for the preparation of manure, will consist of keeping strictly in view the ideas which we formerly stated, when considering the theory of agriculture.\n\nWhen we wish to fertilize land by art, we ought to follow nature, or to imitate the processes by which she fertilizes it. Vegetable substances, fermented by the putrefaction of animal matters, rapidly fall down into earth, and assume the form of that rich black mould which is the most productive of all soils. The great object of the husbandman, therefore, ought to be to procure large quantities of vegetable substances of every kind, such as straw, flax, rushes, weeds, &c., and to lay these up to ferment along with the fresh dung of animals, particularly those animals which chew the cud, for by digesting their food in a very perfect manner, their dung contains a large portion of animal matter. As horses, on the contrary, digest their food very weakly, their dung is often only insufficiently animalized to bring on its own fermentation, which, however, is very strong, on account of the large quantity of bits of straw, hay, and other undecomposed parts of their food which it contains. In the neighbourhood of cities, other animal substances, besides dung, may frequently be obtained; such as bullocks blood, and the refuse of works in which tallow oil is prepared, none of which ought to be neglected by the husbandman.\n\nThe art of fermenting vegetable by animal matters, or the true art of making dung, has not yet been brought to perfection, nor is it in almost any situation sufficiently attended to. In many places, we see large quantities of ferns, rushes, and the coarse grasses of bogs, which no cattle will consume, allowed to run to waste; whereas, though these plants do not readily of themselves run into fermentation, they might easily, by proper care, be made to undergo this process, and consequently be converted into a source of riches, that is, into fertile mould.\n\nOn this subject, we shall here state a mode of preparing dung upon the above principles, that has lately been discovered, and successfully adopted in Midlothian by the Hon. Lord Meadowbank, one of the founders of the College of Justice in Scotland. It consists of subjecting common peat-moss to the process of fermentation, now mentioned, and has been explained by his lordship in a small printed pamphlet, of which, though not sold to the public, a considerable number of copies have been distributed among his lordship's friends.\n\nIt is in the following terms: \"It is proper to state in the outset,\" says his lordship, \"some general facts concerning the preparation of manure, which every practical farmer should be acquainted with.\n\n\"1. All recently dead animal or vegetable matter, if sufficiently divided, moist, and not chilled nearly to low temperature, tends spontaneously to undergo changes, that mode of bringing it at length to be a fat greasy earth, which, when mixed with sands, clays, and a little chalk, or pounded limestone, forms what is called rich loam, or garden-mould.\n\n\"2. In vegetable matter, when amassed in quantities, these changes are at first attended with very considerable heat, (sometimes proceeding the length of inflammation), which, when not exceeding blood-heat, greatly favours and quickens the changes, both in animal matter, and the further changes in vegetable matter, that are not sensibly attended with the production of heat. The changes attended with heat, are said to happen by a fermentation, named from what is observed in making of ale, wine, or vinegar. The latter are ascribed to what is called putrefactive fermentation.\n\n\"3. Besides moderate moisture and heat, and that division of parts which admits the air in a certain degree, circumstances which seem to be necessary to the production of these changes, stirring, or mechanical mixture, favours them; and a similar effect arises from the addition of chalk, pounded limestone, lime, rubbish of old buildings, or burnt lime brought back to its natural state; and also of ashes of burnt coal, peat, or wood, soap-ashes, foot, sea-shells, and sea-ware. And, on the other hand, the changes are stopped or retarded by pressure or consolidation, excluding air; by much water, especially when below the heat of a pool in summer; by astringents; and by caustic substances, as quicklime, acids, and pure alkalies, at least till their acidity is mollified, at the expense of the destruction of part of the animal and vegetable matter to which they are added.\n\n\"4. These...\"\nThese changes are accomplished by the separation or decomposition of the parts or ingredients of which the dead vegetables and animals are composed; by the escape of somewhat of their substance in the form of vapours or gases; by the imbibing also somewhat from water and from the atmosphere; and by the formation of compound matters, from the reunion of parts or ingredients, which had been separated by the powers of the living vegetables and animals. The earlier changes, and in general those which take place previous to the destruction of the adhesion and texture of the dead vegetables and animals, appear to be rather pernicious than favourable to the growth of living vegetables, exposed to the direct effect of them; whereas the changes subsequent to the destruction of the animal and vegetable texture promote powerfully the growth of plants, and, partly by their immediate efficacy on the plants exposed to their influence, partly by the alterations they produce in the soil, constitute what is to be considered as enriching manure (v.).\n\nIt should be the object of the farmer to give his soil the full benefit of these latter changes, decompositions and recompositions, which proceed slowly, and continue to go on for years after the manure is lodged in the soil. Even loam or garden-mould is still undergoing some remaining changes of the same sort; and, by frequently stirring it, or removing it, and using it as a top-dressing, its spontaneous changes are so favoured, that it will yield heavy crops for a time, without fresh manure; or, in other words, it is rendered so far a manure itself, as it decomposes faster than in its ordinary and more stationary state, and, in so doing, nourishes vegetables more abundantly, or forms new combinations in the adjoining soil, that enable it to do so.\n\nIt should also be the object of the farmer, to employ the more early changes, not only to bring forward the substances undergoing them into a proper state to be committed to the soil, but to accelerate or retard them, so as to have his manure ready for use at the proper seasons, with as little loss as possible, from part being too much and part too little decomposed; and also to avail himself of the activity of those changes, to restore to a state of sufficiently rapid spontaneous decomposition, such substances in his farm, as, though in a state of decay, had become so stationary, as to be unfit for manure, without the aid of heat and mixture.\n\nBy attention to the two first particulars, and the proper use of compression, stirring and mixture, the farm dunghill, though formed slowly and of materials in very various states of decay, is brought forward in nearly the same condition. By attention to the latter, manure may, in most situations in Scotland, be tripled or quadrupled; et finum est aurum. On the other hand, by inattention to them, part of the manure is put into the soil unprepared, that is, in a situation where the texture of the vegetable is still entire; and, its decomposition never having been carried far by the heat and mixture of a fermenting mass, proceeds in the soil so slowly, that, like ploughed down stubble, it does not merit the name of manure. Part, again, is apt to be too much rotted, that is, much of it is too nearly approaching to the state of garden-mould, whereby much benefit is lost, by the escape of what had been separated during the process it has undergone, and the good effects on the soil of what remains are less durable; for, between solution in water and rapid decomposition from its advanced state of rottenness, it is soon reduced to that of garden-mould; and, in fine, the powers of fermenting vegetable with animal matter, which, when properly employed, are certainly most efficacious in converting into manure many substances that are otherwise very stationary and slow in their decomposition, are lost to the farmer, so that he is often reduced to adopt an imperfect and little profitable mode of cultivation, from the want of the manure requisite for a better, though such manure may be lying in abundance within his reach, but useless from his ignorance how to prepare it.\n\nPeat-moss is to be found in considerable quantities within reach of most farms in Scotland, particularly in those districts where outfield land (i.e. land not brought into a regular course of cropping and manuring) forms the larger part of the arable land. It consists of the remains of shrubs, trees, heath, and other vegetables, which, under the influence of a cold and moist climate, and in wet situations, have got into a condition almost stationary, but much removed from that of the recently dead vegetable, and certainly considerably distant from that of garden-mould. It is no longer susceptible of going off itself, though placed in the most favourable circumstances, into that rapid fermentation, accompanied with heat, which masses of fresh vegetables experience: But it is still a powerful fuel when dried; and, on the other hand, it requires long exposure to the elements, in a dry situation, before, without mixture, it is fit for the nourishing of living vegetables.\n\nIn general, however, there is nothing in the situation of peat-moss, or in the changes it has undergone, that leads to think that it has suffered any thing that unfit it to be prepared for manure. It is no doubt found sometimes mixed with particular mineral substances, that may be, for a time, pernicious to vegetation; but, in general, there is no such admixture, and, when it does take place, a little patience and attention will be sufficient to cure the evil. In the ordinary case, the only substances found in peat that may be unfavourable to vegetation, in so far at least as tending to keep it stationary and prevent its rotting, are two, and both abounding in fresh vegetables of the sorts of which moss is chiefly composed: These are, gallic acid, and the all-ringing principle, or tan; and as these are got the better of in fresh vegetables by the hot fermentation to which they are subject, so as to leave the general mass of the substances to which they belonged properly prepared manure, there is no reason to suppose, that the same may not be accomplished with the acid and tan of peat. Again, the powers of peat as a fuel, and of ashes of peat as a manure, ought to convince every person, that the material and more essential parts of the dead vegetable, for the formation\n\n(L) Hot fermenting dung partakes of both sorts of fermentation.\nof manure, remain entire in peat. Here the inflammable oils and carbonaceous matter which abound in the fresh vegetable, and the latter of which also abounds in garden-mould, remain entire; the foot and ashes, too, which are the results of the inflammation of each, seem to be nearly equally fertilizing; and, in short, little seems to be lost in peat but the effects of the first fermentation in preparing the matter to undergo its future changes with the rapidity requisite to constitute manure. Besides, the soil produced from peat-earth, by exposure for a course of years, seems not to be sensibly different from that obtained from dung in the same way. Both are deficient in firmness of texture; but are very prolific when mixed with clays, sands, and calcareous earths, in due proportion.\n\nFrom considering the preceding circumstances, and from trying what substances operated on tan, and on the acid found in peat-moss, it was determined to subject it to the influence of different sorts of fermenting dung, with due attention to the proportions used, and to the effects of the different preparations; and the following is the direction, which an experience of six crops recommends to practice.\n\nLet the peat-moss, of which compost is to be formed, be thrown out of the pit for some weeks or months, in order to lose its redundant moisture. By this means, it is rendered the lighter to carry, and less compact and weighty, when made up with other dung, for fermentation; and accordingly less dung is required for the purpose, than if the preparation is made with peat taken recently from the pit.\n\nTake the peat-moss to a dry spot, convenient for constructing a dunghill, to serve the field to be manured. Lay it in two rows, and dung in a row betwixt them. The dung thus lies on the area of the compost-dunghill, and the rows of peat should be near enough each other, that workmen, in making up the compost, may be able to throw them together by the spade, without wheeling. In making up, let the workmen begin at one end. Lay a bottom of peat, 6 inches deep, and 15 feet wide, if the ground admit it (m). Then lay about 10 inches of dung above the peat; then about 6 inches of peat; then four or five of dung, and then fix more of peat; then another thin layer of dung; and then cover it over with peats at the end where it was begun, at the two sides, and above. It should not be raised above 4 feet, or 4½ feet high, otherwise it is apt to press too heavily on the under part, and check the fermentation. When a beginning is thus made, the workmen will proceed working backwards, and adding to the column of compost, as they are furnished with the three rows of materials, directed to be laid down for them. They must take care not to tread on the compost, or render it too compact; and of consequence, in proportion as the peat is wet, it should be made up in lumps, and not much broken.\n\nIn mild weather, even cart-load of common farm-dung, tolerably fresh made, is sufficient for 21 cart-loads of peat-moss; but in cold weather, a larger proportion of dung is desirable. To every 28 carts of the compost, when made up, it is of use to throw on above it a cart-load of ashes, either made from coal, peat, or wood; or if these cannot be had, half the quantity of flaked lime may be used, the more finely powdered the better. But these additions are nowise essential to the general success of the compost.\n\nThe dung to be used should either have been recently made, or kept fresh by compression; as, by the treading of cattle or swine, or by carts passing over it. And if there is little or no litter in it, a smaller quantity will serve, provided any spongy vegetable matter is added at making up the compost, as fresh weeds, the rubbish of a stack-yard, potato-thaws, sawings of timber, &c. And as some sorts of dung, even when fresh, are much more advanced in decomposition than others, it is material to attend to this; for a much less proportion of such dung, as is less advanced, will serve for the compost, provided care is taken to keep the mass sufficiently open, either by a mixture of the above-mentioned substances, or, if these are wanting, by adding the moss piece-meal, that is, first mixing it up in the usual proportion of three to one of dung, and then, after a time, adding an equal quantity, more or less, of moss. The dung of this character, of greatest quantity, is thumble-dung, with which, under the above precautions, six times the quantity of moss, or more, may be prepared. The same holds as to pigeon-dung, and other fowl-dung; and to a certain extent, also, as to that which is collected from towns, and made by animals that feed on grains, refuse of dairies, &c.\n\nThe compost, after it is made up, gets into a general heat, sooner or later, according to the weather, and the condition of the dung: in summer, in ten days or sooner; in winter, not perhaps for many weeks, if the cold is severe. It always, however, has been found to come on at last; and in summer, it sometimes rises so high, as to be mischievous, by consuming the materials, (fire-hanging). In that season, a stick should be kept in it in different parts, to pull out and feel now and then: for if it approaches to blood-heat, it should either be watered, or turned over; and on such an occasion, advantage may be taken to mix it with a little fresh moss. The heat subsides after a time, and with great variety, according to the weather, the dung, and the perfection of the making up of the compost; which then should be allowed to remain untouched, till within three weeks of using, when it should be turned over, upside down, and outside in, and all lumps broken: then it comes into a second heat; but soon cools, and should be taken out for use. In this state, the whole, except bits of the old decayed wood, appears a black free mass, and spreads like garden-mould. Use it, weight for weight, as farm-yard dung; and it will be found, in a course of cropping, fully to stand the comparison.\n\nThe addition recommended of ashes or lime, is thought to favour the general perfection of the preparation, and to hasten the second heat. The lime laid on above the dunghill, as directed, is rendered mild by the vapours that escape during the first heat.\n\nCompost, made up before January, has hitherto been\n\n(m) This alludes to the propriety, in clay lands, of suiting the dunghill to the breadth of a single ridge, free of each furrow.\nManures been in good order for the spring-crops; but this may not happen in a long frost. In summer, it is ready in eight or ten weeks; and if there is an anxiety to have it soon prepared, the addition of ashes, or of a little lime-rubboith of old buildings, or of lime, flaked with foul water, applied to the dung used in making up, will quicken the process considerably.\n\n\"Lime has been mixed previously with the peat; but the compost prepared with that mixture, or with the simple peat, seemed to produce equally good crops. All the land, however, that it has been tried on, has been limed more or less within these 25 years.\n\n\"Peat prepared with lime alone, has not been found to answer as a good manure. In one instance, viz. on a bit of fallow sown with wheat, it was manifestly pernicious. Neither with cow-water alone is it prepared, unless by lying immersed in a pool of it for a long time, when it turns into a sort of fleetech, which makes an excellent top-dressing. Something of the same sort happens with soap-fuds, and water of common flores, &c. Lime-water was not found to unite with the tan in peat, nor was urine (n). Peat made up with seaweed gets into heat, and the peat seems to undergo the same change as when prepared with dung. But the effect of this preparation on crops has not yet been experienced. Peat has also been exposed to the fumes of a putrefying carcass. In one instance the peat proved a manure; but much weaker than when prepared with dung. There, however, the proportion used was very large to the carcass. Other trials are making, where the proportion is less, and with, or without, the addition of ashes, lime, &c. In all these cases, there can be no sensible heat. Peat, heated and rendered friable by the action of the living principle of turnips in growing, was not found entitled, when used as a top-dressing, to the character of manure. It had been made up in the view of preserving the turnips during frost. But the turnips sprung, and the mats heated. The turnips were taken out and the peat afterwards used as a top-dressing. Peat is now under trial, as preparing with turnips and fresh weeds, in fermentation, without the admixture of any animalized matters.\n\n\"It is said that dry peat-earth is used as a manure in some parts of England. But unless in chalky soils, or others where there may be a great want of carbonaceous matter, it is much doubted whether it could be used with any sensible advantage. Peat-ashes were found to raise turnips, but to have no sensible effect on the next crop.\n\n\"The quantity of the compost used per acre, has varied considerably, according to the richness of the soil manured, and the condition in which it is at manuring, and the season in which the manure is applied. From 23 to 35 cart-load, by two horses each, is about what has been given; the lesser to fallows and ground in good tilth, and the larger when to be ploughed in Manures, with the hazard of poor land; and the intermediate quantities, with tares, peas, potatoes, &c.; and it has in most cases undergone comparative trials with different sorts of common dung.\n\n\"It may be proper to add, that too much attention cannot be paid to the proper preparation of the ground for the reception of manure. It should be clean, pretty dry at the application, and well mixed and friable. Much of the manure applied is otherwise lost, whether lime, dung, or compost. The additional quantities recommended when the land is coarse, is just so much that would have been saved by better cultivation. Common farmers are little aware of this. They might save at least half their lime, did they lay it on in powder (o), and on fallows, only harrowing it, and letting it wait for a shower before it is ploughed in; and perhaps not much less of their dung. It is astonishing what a visible effect is produced on land properly mixed by a fallow, from the addition of only a very small quantity of properly prepared dung or compost. Both its texture and colour undergo a very sensible change, which cannot be accounted for, except from the extrication of substances from the decomposing manure, (probably from its spontaneous tendency to decompose being aided by the chemical action of various matters in a foil so prepared): And from these substances operating in the soil, numberless compositions and decompositions, or tendencies to them, take place, from the various elective attractions of the different parts of which it is composed. It is obvious, that an immensely greater proportion of manure must be required to produce even a little of this, where the soil is coarse or lumpy, or consolidated by wetness, than when put into a situation favourable to the reciprocal action of the various substances contained in it, a variety and an admixture formed by nature in perfection in the more favoured soils, (as in the bottom of drained lakes, haughs, Delta ground), and which it is the business of the skilful and industrious farmer to form or make compensation for the want of, by judicious manuring, where nature has been less bountiful of her gifts.\n\n\"It was meant to have given a detailed account of many of the experiments that have been made, whether in Agriculture or Chemistry. But as these are still going on, and the practical results have attracted some attention, and prompted imitation by neighbours and acquaintance, so that manuscript directions have been often applied for and obtained, it has been preferred to print, in the mean time, this short account of the business, divested of scientific language, and suited to the perusal of any practical husbandman. It was indeed felt as a degree of wrong, not to take some steps to make it public, as soon as the certainty of success warranted. And both the power and the duration\n\n(n) Tan combines with animal gelly, and loses its astringency. The animalized matter, extricated in fermenting dung, has probably this effect on the tan in peat, as well as to render the acid innocent. As vegetable matters seem in general to contain the ingredients of, and often somewhat similar to, animal gluten, it is possible that the fermentation of fresh vegetables alone may prove sufficient to prepare the peat to rot in the foil expeditiously; but it is certainly desirable to use also animalized matter for this purpose.\n\n(o) This they may, though driven in winter, and drowned in the heaps by rains. They have only to turn it over with a very small additional quantity of new burnt shells when they come to use it.\nManures have now stood the test of a great variety of trials, on a considerable extent of ground, and of much diversity of soil, continued without intermission during the last five years. Hitherto it has been found equal, and indeed preferable, to common farm-yard dung, for the first three years, and decidedly to surpass it afterwards. It has been conjectured, from the appearance and effects of the compost, that its parts are less volatile and soluble than those of dung; but that it yields to the crop what is requisite, by the action of the living fibres of vegetables; and in this way wastes slower, and lasts longer. Whatever be in this, nothing has appeared more remarkable, than its superiority in maintaining (for four and five years) fresh and nourishing the pasture of thin clays, that had been laid down with it, and in making them yield well when again ploughed, and that without any top-dressing, or new manure of any sort. Employed in this way, the effect of common dung is soon over, the soil becoming consolidated, and the pasture stunt ed; and hence such soils have not usually been cultivated with advantage, except by tillage, and by the aid of quantities of manure, got by purchase, and much beyond the produce of the farm-yard. It is believed that the foregoing directions will, if practised, prove beneficial to every farmer who has access to peat-moss within a moderate distance; but it is to the farmers of the soils now mentioned, and of hungry gravels, to whom they would be found particularly valuable.\n\nLet it be observed, that the object in making up the compost is to form as large a hot-bed as the quantity of dung employed admits of, and then to surround it on all sides, so as to have the whole benefit of the heat and effluvia. Peat, as dry as garden-mould, in feed-time, may be mixed with the dung, so as to double the volume and more, and nearly triple the weight, and instead of hurting the heat prolong it. Workmen must begin with using layers; but, when accustomed to the just proportions, if they are furnished with peat moderately dry, and dung not loft in litter, they throw it up together as a mixed mass; and they improve in the art, so as to make a less proportion of dung serve for the preparation.\n\nWith regard to the other kinds of manure commonly in use in this country, their efficacy is well known; the only difficulty is to procure them in sufficient quantity.—In such lands as lie near the sea, sea-weeds offer an unlimited quantity of excellent manure. In the neighbourhood of rivers, the weeds with which they abound offer likewise an excellent manure in plenty. Oil-cake, malt-coombs, the refuse of slaughter-houses, &c. are all excellent where they can be got; but the situations which afford these are comparatively few; so that in most cases the farmer must depend much on his own ingenuity and industry for raising a sufficient quantity of dung to answer his purposes; and the methods taken for this purpose vary according to the situation of different places, or according to the fancy of the husbandman.\n\nIn all countries where chalk, marl, or lime are to be had, they are certainly to be employed in their proper departments; but besides these, dung, properly so called, mixed with earth or putrid animal and vegetable substances, everywhere constitutes a principal part of the manure. In Norfolk, Mr Marhall tells us, that the quality of dung is attended to with greater precision than in most other districts. Town-muck, as it is called, is held in most estimation; and the large towns Norwich and Yarmouth supply the neighbouring country. As Yarmouth, however, is a maritime place, and otherwise in a manner surrounded by marshes, straw is of course a scarce and dear article; whence, instead of littering their horses with it, they use sand. As the bed becomes foiled or wet, fresh sand is put on, until the whole is in a manner saturated with urine and dung, when it is cleared away, and reckoned muck of such excellent quality, that it is sent for from a very great distance. With regard to other kinds of dung, that from horses fed upon hay and corn is looked upon to be the best; that of fatting cattle the next; while the dung of lean cattle, particularly of cows, is supposed to be greatly inferior, even though turnips make part of their food. The dung of cattle kept on straw alone is looked upon to be of little or no value; while the muck from trodden straw is by some thought to be better than that from the straw which is eaten by the lean stock.—Composts of dung with earth or marl are very generally used.\n\nIn the midland counties of England, Mr Marhall informs us, the cores of horns crushed in a mill have been used as manure; though he knows not with what success. His only objection is the difficulty of reducing them to powder. Dung is extremely dear in Norfolk; half a guinea being commonly given for a waggon-load driven by five horses. Great quantities of lime and marl are found in this district. With regard to the method of raising dung in general, perhaps the observations of Mr Marhall upon the management of the Yorkshire farmers may be equally satisfactory with anything that has yet been published on the subject.\n\nThe general practice (says he) is to pile the dung on the highest part of the yard; or, which is Mr Marhall's direction for raising its virtues. The urine which does not mix with the dung is almost invariably led off the nearest way to the common sewer, as if it were thought a nuisance to the premises. That which mixes with the dung is of course carried to the midden, and assists in the general diffusion. A yard of dung, nine-tenths of which are straw, will discharge, even in dry weather, some of its more fluid particles; and in rainy weather, is notwithstanding the straw, liable to be washed away if exposed on a rising ground. But how much more liable to waste is a mixture of dung and urine, with barely a sufficiency of straw to keep them together? In dry weather the natural oozing is considerable; and in a wet season every shower of rain washes it away in quantities. The Norfolk method of bottoming the dung-yard with mould is here indispensably necessary to common good management. There is no better manure for grass-lands than mould, saturated with the oozing of a dunghill: it gets down quickly among the grass, and has generally a more visible effect than the dung itself. Under this management the arable land would have the self-same dung it now has; while the grass-lands would have an annual supply of riches, which now run to waste in the sewers and rivulets. But before a dung-yard can with propriety be bottomed with mould, the bot tom\nA part of it situated conveniently for carriages to come at, and low enough to receive the entire drainings of the stable, cattle-dalls, and hog-places, should be hollowed out in the manner of an artificial drinking-pool, with a rim somewhat rising, and with covered drains laid into it from the various sources of liquid manure. During the summer months, at leisure times, and embracing opportunities of back-carriage, fill the hollow nearly full with mould, such as the scourings of ditches, the floppings of roads, the maiden earth of lanes and waste corners, the coping of stone-quarries, &c., &c., leaving the surface somewhat dished; and within this dish let the dung-pile carefully keep up a rim of mould round the base of the pile higher than the adjoining surface of the yard; equally to prevent extraneous matter from finding its way into the reservoirs, and to prevent the escape of that which falls within its circuit.\"\n\nThe use of lime, as a manure, was formerly mentioned*, and also the principle upon which its value depends. It ought to be used not for the purpose of giving food to the plants, but as a stimulant, tending to bring the soil into activity, by reducing to mould all the dead roots of vegetables with which it may abound. Hence it ought never to be used without dung upon soils that have been exhausted by repeated cropping, and that are in a clean state.\n\nHowever people may differ in other particulars, all agree, that the operation of lime depends on its intimate mixture with the soil; and therefore that the proper time of applying it, is when it is perfectly powdered, and the soil at the same time in the highest degree of pulverization. Lime itself is absolutely barren; and yet it enriches a barren soil. Neither of the two produces any good effect without the other; and consequently, the more intimately they are mixed, the effect must be the greater.\n\nHence it follows, that lime ought always to be flaked with a proper quantity of water, because by that means it is reduced the most effectually into powder. Lime left to be flaked by a moist air, or accidental rain, is seldom or never thoroughly reduced into powder, and therefore cannot be intimately mixed with the soil. Sometimes an opportunity offers to bring home shell-lime before the ground is ready for it; and it is commonly thrown into a heap without cover, trusting to rain for flaking. The proper way is, to lay the shell-lime in different heaps on the ground where it is to be spread, to reduce these heaps into powder by flaking with water, and to cover the flaked lime with sod, so as to defend it from rain. One, however, should avoid as much as possible the bringing home lime before the ground is ready for it. Where allowed to lie long in a heap, there are two bad consequences: first, lime attracts moisture, even though well covered, and runs into clots, which prevents an intimate mixture; and, next, we know that burnt limestone, whether in shells or in powder, returns gradually into its original state of limestone; and upon that account also, is less capable of being mixed with the soil. And this is verified by a fact, that, after lying long, it is so hard bound together as to require a pick to separate the parts.\n\nFor the same reason, it is a bad practice, though common, to let spread lime lie on the surface all winter. The bad effects above mentioned take place here in part: and there is another, that rain washes the lime down to the furrows, and in a hanging field carries the whole away.\n\nAs the particles of powdered lime are both small and heavy, they quickly sink to the bottom of the furrow, mingling if care be not taken to prevent it. In that view, it is a rule, that lime be spread and mixed with the soil immediately before sowing, or along with the seed. In this manner of application, there being no occasion to move it till the ground be stirred for a new crop, it has time to incorporate with the soil, and does not readily separate from it. Thus, if turnip-seed is to be sown broad-cast, the lime ought to be laid on immediately before sowing, and harrowed in with the seed. If a crop of drilled turnip or cabbage be intended, the lime ought to be spread immediately before forming in drills. With respect to wheat, the lime ought to be spread immediately before seed-harrowing. If spread more early, before the ground be sufficiently broken, it sinks to the bottom. If a light soil be prepared for barley, the lime ought to be spread after seed-harrowing, and harrowed in with the seed. In a strong soil, it sinks not so readily to the bottom, and therefore, before sowing the barley, the lime ought to be mixed with the soil by a brake. Where moor is summer-fallowed for a crop of oats next year, the lime ought to be laid on immediately before the last ploughing, and braked in as before. It has sufficient time to incorporate with the soil before the land be stirred again.\n\nThe quantity to be laid on depends on the nature of the soil. Upon a strong soil, 70 or 80 bolls of shells are not more than sufficient, reckoning four small fir-balls to the bolt, termed wheat measure; nor will it be an overdose to lay on 100 bolls. Between 50 and 60 may suffice upon medium soils; and upon the thin or gravelly, between 39 and 40. It is not safe to lay a much greater quantity on such soils.\n\nIt is common to lime a pasture-field immediately before ploughing. This is an unsafe practice; it is pasture-fields thrown to the bottom of the furrow, from which it is never fully gathered up. The proper time for liming a pasture-field, intended to be taken up for corn, is a year at least; or two, before ploughing. It is washed in by rain among the roots of the plants, and has time to incorporate with the soil.\n\nLimestone beat small makes an excellent manure; Beat lime and supplies the want of powdered lime where there is none, no fuel to burn the limestone. Limestone beat small has not hitherto been much used as a manure; and the proportion between it and powdered lime has not been ascertained. What follows may give some light. Three pounds of raw lime is by burning reduced to two pounds of shell-lime. Yet nothing is expelled by the fire but the air that was in the limestone: the calcareous earth remains entire. Ergo, two pounds of shell-lime contain as much calcareous earth as three pounds of raw limestone. Shell-lime of the best quality, when flaked with water, will measure out to thrice the quantity. But as limestone loses none of its bulk by being burnt into shells, it follows, that three bushels of raw limestone contain as much calcareous earth as six bushels of powdered lime; and consequently, if powdered\nlime possess not some virtue above raw limestone, three bushels of the latter beat small should equal as a manure six bushels of the former.\n\nShell-marl, as a manure, is managed in every respect like powdered lime; with this only difference, that a fifth or a fourth part more in measure ought to be given. The reason is, that shell-marl is less weighty than lime; and that a boll of it contains less calcareous earth, which is the fruitifying part of both.\n\nClay and stone marls, with respect to husbandry, are the same, though in appearance different.\n\nThe goodness of marl depends on the quantity of calcareous earth in it: which has been known to amount to a half or more. It is too expensive if the quantity be less than a third or a fourth part. Good marl is the most substantial of all manures; because it improves the weakest ground to equal the best borough-acres. The low part of Berwickshire, termed the Merse, abounds everywhere with this marl; and is the only county in Scotland where it is plenty.\n\nLand ought to be cleared of weeds before marling; and it ought to be smoothed with the brake and harrow, in order that the marl may be equally spread. Marl is a foil on which no vegetable will grow; its efficacy depends, like that of lime, on its pulverization, and intimate mixture with the soil. Toward the former, alternate drought and moisture contribute greatly, as also frost. Therefore, after being evenly spread, it ought to lie on the surface all winter. In the month of October it may be roufed with a brake; which will bring to the surface, and expose to the air and frost all the hard parts, and mix with the foil all that is powdered. In that respect it differs widely from dung and lime, which ought usually to be ploughed into the ground without delay. Oats is a hardy grain, which will answer for height the first crop after marling better than any other; and it will succeed though the marl be not thoroughly mixed with the soil. In that case, the marl ought to be ploughed in with an ebb furrow immediately before sowing, and braked thoroughly. It is ticklish to make wheat the first crop: if sown before winter, frost swells the marl, and is apt to throw the seed out of the ground; if sown in spring, it will suffer more than oats by want of due mixture.\n\nSummer is the proper season for marling; because in that season the marl, being dry, is not only lighter, but is easily reduced to powder. Frost, however, is not improper for marling, especially as in frost there is little opportunity for any other work.\n\nMarl is a heavy body, and sinks to the bottom of the furrow, if indifferently ploughed. Therefore the first crop should always have an ebb furrow. During the growing of that crop, the marl has time to incorporate with the soil, and to become a part of it; after which it does not readily separate.\n\nOf late a new manure has been introduced into some countries. This is gypsum, which is lime united with sulphuric acid. In the eighth volume of the Annals of Agriculture we are informed, that it is commonly used as a manure in Switzerland. In the tenth volume of the same work, Sir Richard Sutton gives some account of an experiment made with it on his estate; but in such an inaccurate manner, that nothing could be determined. \"The appearance in general (says he), I think, was rather against the benefit of the platter, though not decidedly so.\" He tells us, that its virtues were a subject of debate in Germany. In America this substance seems to have met with more success than in any other country. In the fifth volume of Bath Papers, Mr Kirkpatrick of the Isle of Wight, who had himself visited North America, informs us, that it is much used in the United States, on account of its cheapness and efficacy; though, from what is there stated, we must undoubtedly be led to suppose, that its efficacy must be very great before it can be entitled to the praise of cheapness. In the first place, it is brought from the hills in the neighbourhood of Paris to Havre de Grace, and from thence exported to America; which of itself must occasion a considerable expense, though the platter were originally given gratis. In the next place, it must be powdered in a fluming mill, and the finer it is powdered so much the better. In the third place, it must be sown over the ground to be manured with it. The quantity for grass is five bushels to an acre. It ought to be sown on dry ground in a wet day; and its efficacy is said to last from seven to twelve years. It operates entirely as a top-dressing.\n\nIn the tenth volume of the Annals of Agriculture, we have some extracts from a treatise by Mr Powel, president of the Philadelphia Society for encouraging Agriculture, upon the subject of gypsum as a manure; of the efficacy of which he gives the following instances.\n\n1. In October 1786, platter of Paris was sown in a rainy day upon wheat-rubble without any previous culture. The crop of wheat had scarcely been worth reaping, and no kind of grass seed had been sown upon the ground; nevertheless, in the month of June it was covered with a thick mat of white clover, clean and even, from six to eight inches in height. A piece of ground adjoining to this white clover was also sown with gypsum, and exhibited a fine appearance of white and red clover mixed with spear-grass. Some wet ground sown at the same time was not in the least improved.—This anecdote rests entirely on the veracity of an anonymous farmer. 2. Eight bushels of platter of Paris spread upon two acres and a half of wheat-rubble ground, which the spring before had been sowed with about two pounds of red clover-seed to the acre for pasture, yielded five tons of hay by the middle of June. A small piece of ground of similar quality, but without any platter, produced only one ton and a half in the same proportion.—Mr Powel concludes in favour of the effects of the platter upon arable as well as grass land.\n\nOther accounts to the same purpose have been published, though it must also be remarked, that various persons who have made trial of this manure, declare themselves dissatisfied with it; but it does not appear that it has hitherto been at all tried in this part of the island.\n\nWhen a soil abounds too much in particles of a particular kind, it has been found expedient to mix it with earth of a different character. Hence we are informed in the twelfth volume of the Annals of Agriculture, that in Cornwall, large quantities of sea-land are annually conveyed to the land, and laid upon the soil; a practice which will no doubt have a tendency to ameliorate nature. If clay, and to render them more pervious to the roots of plants. With the same view, and also to save fuel, a practice is laid to exist in the Netherlands, of baking\nbaking up the drofs or culm of coal, and also peat-earth, with clay, into lumps or bricks, which when dried in the air, make excellent fuel, and also afford an immense quantity of valuable ashes to be laid upon the land.\n\n**Sect. VIII. Principles and Operations of the Drill or Horse-hoeing Husbandry.**\n\nThe general properties attributed to the new or drill husbandry may be reduced to two, viz. the promoting the growth of plants by hoeing, and the saving of seed; both of which are equally profitable to the farmer.\n\nThe advantages of tillage before sowing have already been pointed out. In this place we must confine ourselves to the utility of tillage after sowing. This kind of tillage is most generally known by the name of horse-hoeing.\n\nLand sown with wheat, however well it may be cultivated in autumn, sinks in the winter; the particles get nearer together, and the weeds rise; so that in spring, the land is nearly in the same situation as if it never had been ploughed. This, however, is the season when it should branch and grow with most vigour; and consequently stands most in need of ploughing or hoeing, to destroy the weeds, to supply the roots with fresh earth, and, by dividing anew the particles of the soil, to allow the roots to extend and collect nourishment.\n\nIt is well known, that, in gardens, plants grow with double vigour after being hoed or transplanted. If plants growing in arable land could be managed with care and safety in this manner, it is natural to expect, that their growth would be promoted accordingly. Experience shows, that this is not only practicable, but attended with many advantages.\n\nIn the operation of hoeing wheat, though some of the roots be moved or broken, the plants receive no injury; for this very circumstance makes them send forth a greater number of roots than formerly, which enlarge their pasture, and consequently augment their growth.\n\nSickly wheat has often recovered its vigour after a good hoeing, especially when performed in weather not very hot or dry.\n\nWheat, and such grain as is sown before winter, requires hoeing more than oats, barley, or other grain sown in the spring; for, if the land has been well ploughed before the sowing of spring corn, it neither has time to harden, nor to produce many weeds, not having been exposed to the winter's snow and rain.\n\n**Of Sowing.**\n\nAs in the practice of the new husbandry, plants grow with greater vigour than by the old method, the land should be sown thinner. It is this principle of the new husbandry that has been chiefly objected to; for, upon observing the land occupied by a small number of plants, people are apt to look upon all the vacant space as lost. But this prejudice will soon be removed, when it is considered, that in the best land cultivated in the common method, and sown very thick, each seed produces but one or two ears; that, in the same land sown thinner, every seed produces two or three ears; and that a single seed sometimes produces 18 or 21 ears.\n\n**Method of sowing in the drill husbandry.**\n\nIn the common method, as there are many more plants than can find sufficient nourishment, and as it is impossible to assist them by hoeing, numbers die before they attain maturity; the greatest part remain sickly and drooping; and thus part of the seed is lost. On the contrary, in the new method, all the plants have as much food as they require; and as they are, from time to time, assisted by hoeing, they become so vigorous as to equal in their production the numerous but sickly plants cultivated in the common method.\n\n**Of Hoeing.**\n\nThe new husbandry is absolutely impracticable in lands that are not easily ploughed. Attempting to cultivate land according to this husbandry, without attending to this circumstance, that it is practicable in no land excepting such as have already been brought into good tilth by the old method, has gone far to make it contemptible in many places.\n\nWhen a field is in good tilth, it should be sown so thin as to leave sufficient room for the plants to extend their roots. After being well ploughed and harrowed, it must be divided into rows, at the distance of thirty inches from one another. On the sides of each of these rows, two rows of wheat must be sown five inches distant from each other. By this means there will be an interval of two feet wide betwixt the rows, and every plant will have room enough to extend its roots, and to supply it with food. The intervals will likewise be sufficient for allowing the earth to be hoed or tilled without injuring the plants in the rows.\n\nThe first hoeing, which should be given before the winter, is intended to drain away the wet, and to prepare the earth to be mellowed by the frosts. These two ends will be answered by drawing two small furrows at a little distance from the rows, and throwing the earth taken from the furrows into the middle of the intervals. This first hoeing should be given when the wheat is in leaf.\n\nThe second hoeing, which is intended to make the plants branch, should be given after the hard frosts are over. To do this with advantage, after stirring the earth a little near the rows, the earth which was thrown into the middle of the intervals should be turned back into the furrows. This earth, having been mellowed by the winter, supplies the plants with excellent food, and makes the roots extend.\n\nThe third hoeing, which is intended to invigorate the stalk, should be given when the ears of the corn begin to show themselves. This hoeing may, however, be very slight.\n\nBut the last hoeing is of the greatest importance, as it enlarges the grain, and makes the ears fill at their extremities. This hoeing should be given when the wheat is in bloom; a furrow must be drawn in the middle of the interval, and the earth thrown to the right and left on the foot of the plants. This supports the plants, prevents them from being laid, and prepares the ground for the next sowing, as the seed is then to be put in the middle of the ground that formed the intervals.\n\nThe best season for hoeing is two or three days after rain, or so soon after rain as the soil will quit the instrument in hoeing. Light dry soils may be hoed almost at any time, but this is far from being the case with strong\nstrong clay foils; the season for hoeing such is frequently short and precarious; every opportunity therefore should be carefully watched, and eagerly embraced. The two extremes of wet and dry, are great enemies to vegetation in strong clay foils. There is a period between the time of clay foils running together, so as to puddle by superfluous wet, and the time of their caking by drought, in which they are perfectly manageable. This is the juncture for hoeing; and so much land as shall be thus feasonably hoed, will not cake or crust upon the surface, as it otherwise would have done, till it has been soaked or drenched again with rain; in which case the hoeing is to be repeated as soon as the foil will quit the instrument, and as often as necessary; by which time the growing crop will begin to cover the ground, so as to act as a screen to the surface of the land against the intense heat of the sun, and thereby prevent, in a great measure, the bad effects of the foil's caking in dry weather.\n\nBy this successive tillage, or hoeing, good crops will be obtained, provided the weather is not very unfavourable.\n\nBut as strong vigorous plants are long before they arrive at maturity, corn raised in the new way is later in ripening than any other, and must therefore be sown earlier.\n\nIn order to prepare the intervals for sowing again, some well-rotted dung may be laid in the deep furrows made in the middle of the intervals; and this dung must be covered with the earth that was before thrown towards the rows of wheat. But, if the land does not require mending, the deep furrow is filled without any dung. This operation should be performed immediately after harvest, that there may be time to give the land a slight stirring before the rows are sowed; which should occupy the middle of the space which formed the intervals during the last crop. The intervals of the second year take up the space occupied by the stubble of the first.\n\nSupposing dung to be necessary, which is denied by many, a very small quantity is sufficient; a single layer, put in the bottom of each furrow, will be enough.\n\nDescription of the Instruments commonly used in the New Husbandry.\n\nFig. 1. is a marking plough. The principal use of this plough is to straighten and regulate the ridges. The first line is traced by the eye, by means of three poles, placed in a straight line. The plough draws the first furrow in the direction of this line; and at the same time, with the tooth A, fixed in the block of wood near the end of the cross-pole or fluter BB, marks the breadth of the ridge at the distance intended. The ploughman next traces the second line or rut made by the tooth, and draws a small furrow along it; and continues in this manner till the whole field is laid out in straight and equidistant ridges.\n\nFig. 2. is a plough for breaking up ley, or turning up the bottom of land when greatly exhausted. By its construction, the width and depth of the furrows can be regulated to a greater certainty than by any other hitherto known in this country. Its appearance is heavy; but two horses are sufficient to plough with it in ordinary free land; and only four are necessary in the stiffest clay foils. This plough is likewise easily held and tempered. A, is the sword fixed in the fluters B, which runs through a mortise E, at the end of the beam C, and regulates the depth of the furrow by raising or depressing the beam; it is fixed by putting the pin D through the beam and sword, and is moveable at E.\n\nFig. 3. is a jointed brake-harrow with 24 teeth, shaped like coulters, and standing at about an angle of 80 degrees. By this instrument the land is finely pulverized, and prepared for receiving the seed from the drill. It requires four horses in stiff, and two in open land. This harrow is likewise used for levelling the ridges; which is done by pressing it down by the handles where the ridge is high, and raising it up when low.\n\nFig. 4. is an angular weeding harrow, which may follow the brake when necessary. The seven hindmost teeth should stand at a more acute angle than the rest, in order to collect the weeds, which the holder can drop at pleasure, by raising the hinder part, which is fixed to the body of the harrow by two joints.\n\nFig. 5. is a pair of harrows with shafts. This harrow is used for covering the seed in the drills, the horse going in the furrow.\n\nFig. 6. is a drill-plough, constructed in such a manner as to sow at once two rows of beans, peas, or wheat. This machine is easily wrought by two horses. A, is the hopper for containing the seed; B, circular boxes for receiving the seed from the hopper; CC, two square boxes which receive the seed from small holes in the circular boxes, as they turn round; and last of all, the seed is dropped into the drills through holes in the square boxes, behind the coulters D. The cylinder E follows, which, together with the wheel F, regulates the depth of the coulters, and covers the seed; the barrow G comes behind all, and covers the seed more completely. HH, two sliders, which, when drawn out, prevent the seed from falling into the boxes; and I, is a ketch which holds the rungs, and prevents the boxes from turning, and losing seed at the ends of the ridges.\n\nFig. 7. is a single hoe-plough of a very simple construction, by which the earth in the intervals is stirred and laid up on both sides to the roots of the plants, and at the same time the weeds are destroyed. AA, the mouldboards, which may be raised or depressed at pleasure, according as the farmer wants to throw the earth higher or lower upon the roots.\n\nFig. 2. is a drill-rake for peas. This instrument, Plate IX., which is chiefly calculated for small inclosures of light grounds, is a sort of strong plough rake, with four large teeth at a, a, b, b, a little incurved. The distance from a to a, and from b to b, is nine inches. The interval between the two inner teeth, a and b, is three feet six inches, which allows sufficient room for the hole-plough to move in. To the piece of timber c c, forming the head of the rake, are fixed the handles d, and the beam e to which the horse is fastened. When this instrument is drawn over a piece of land made thoroughly fine, and the man who holds it bears upon the handles, four furrows f, g, h, i, will be formed, at the distances determined by the construction of the instrument. These distances may be accurately preserved, provided that the teeth a a return when the plough...\nman comes back, after having ploughed one turn, in two of the channels formed before, marked b b: thus all the furrows in the field will be traced with the same regularity. When the ground is thus formed into drills, the seeds may be scattered by a single motion of the hand at a certain distance from one another into the channels, and then covered with the flat part of a hand-rake, and pressed down gently. This instrument is so simple, that any workman may easily make or repair it.\n\nOn Plate XI. is delineated a patent drill machine, lately invented by the Reverend James Cooke of Heaton-Norris near Manchester. A, the upper part of the feed-box; B, the lower part of the same box; C, a moveable partition, with a lever, by which the grain or seed is let fall at pleasure from the upper to the lower part of the feed-box, from whence it is taken up by cups or ladles applied to the cylinder D, and dropped into the funnel E, and conveyed thereby into the furrow or drill made in the land by the coulter F, and covered by the rake or harrow G. H, a lever, by which the wheel I is lifted out of generation with the wheel K, to prevent the grain or seed being scattered upon the ground, while the machine is turning round at the end of the land, by which the harrow G is also lifted from the ground at the same time, and by the same motion, by means of the crank, and the horizontal lever h h. L, a sliding lever, with a weight upon it, by means of which the depth of the furrows or drills, and consequently the depth that the grain or seed will be deposited in the land, may be easily ascertained. M, a screw in the coulter beam, by turning of which the seed-box B is elevated or depressed, in order to prevent the grain or seed being crushed or bruised by the revolution of the cups or ladles. Fig. 13, a rake with iron teeth, to be applied to the under side of the rails of the machine, with flaps and screw nuts at n n, by which many useful purposes are answered, viz., in accumulating cutch or hay into rows, and as a scarifier for young crops of wheat in the spring, or to be used upon a fallow; in which case, the feed-box, the ladle cylinder, the coulters, the funnels, and harrows, are all taken away.\n\nThis side view of the machine is represented, for the sake of perspicuity, with one feed-box only, one coulter, one funnel, one harrow, &c. whereas a complete machine is furnished with five coulters, five harrows, seven funnels, a feed-box in eight partitions, &c. with ladles of different sizes, for different sorts of grain and seeds.\n\nThese machines (with five coulters fifteen guineas, with four coulters fifteen guineas), equally excel in setting or planting all sorts of grain and seeds, even carrot-seed, to exactness, after the rate of from eight to ten chain acres per day, with one man, a boy, and two horses. They deposit the grain or seed in any given quantity from one peck to three bushels per acre, regularly and uniformly, and that without grinding or bruising the seed, and at any given depth, from half an inch to half a dozen inches, in rows at the distance of twelve, fifteen and twenty-four inches, or any other distance. They are equally useful on all lands, are durable, easy to manage, and by no means subject to be put out of repair.\n\nThe ladle cylinder D is furnished with cups or ladles of four different sizes for different sorts of grain or seeds, which may be distinguished by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4—N° 1, (the smallest size) is calculated for turnip-feed, clover-feed, cole-feed, rape, &c. and will sow something more than one pound per statute acre. N° 2, for wheat, rye, hemp, flax, &c. and will sow something more than one bushel per acre. N° 3, for barley; and will sow one bushel and a half per acre, N° 4, for beans, oats, peas, vetches, &c. and will sow two bushels per acre.\n\nNotwithstanding the above specified quantities of grain or seeds, a greater or less quantity of each may be sown at pleasure, by stopping up with a little clay or by adding a few ladles to each respective box. The grain or seeds intended to be sown, must be put in those boxes, to which the cups or ladles as above described respectively belong, an equal quantity into each box, and all the other boxes empty. The ladle cylinder may be reversed, or turned end for end at pleasure, for different sorts of grain, &c.\n\nFor sowing beans, oats, peas, &c. with a five-coulter machine, four large ladles must occasionally be applied at equal distances round those parts of the cylinder which subtend the two end boxes. And for sowing barley, eight large ones must be applied as above; or four ladles, N° 2, to each of the wheat boxes. These additional ladles are fixed on the cylinder with nails, or taken off in a few minutes; but for sowing with a four coulter machine, the above alterations are not necessary.\n\nThe funnels are applied to their respective places by corresponding numbers. Care should be taken, that the points of the funnels stand directly behind the backs of the coulters, which is done by wedges being applied to one side or other of the coulters, at the time they are fixed in their respective places.\n\nThe machine being thus put together, which is readily and expeditiously done, as no separate part will coincide with any other but that to which it respectively belongs, and an equal quantity of grain or seed in each of the respective boxes, the land also being previously ploughed and harrowed once or so in a place to level the surface; but if the land be very rough, a roller will best answer that purpose, whenever the land is dry enough to admit of it; and upon strong clays, a spiked roller is sometimes necessary to reduce the size of the large dry clods; which being done, the driver should walk down the furrow or edge of the land, and having hold of the last horse's head with his hand, he will readily keep him in such a direction, as will bring the outside coulter of the machine within three or four inches of the edges of the land or ridge, at which uniform extent, he should keep his arm till he comes to the end of the land; where having turned round, he must come to the other side of his horses, and walking upon the last outside drill, having hold of the horse's head with his hand as before, he will readily keep the machine in such a direction, as will strike the succeeding drill at such a distance from the last outside one, or that he walks upon, as the coulters are distant from each other.\n\nThe person who attends the machine should put down the lever H soon enough at the end of the land, that the cups or ladles may have time to fill, before he begins to low; and at the end of the land, he must apply\nply his right hand to the middle of the rail between the handles, by which he will keep the coulters in the ground, while he is lifting up the lever H with his left hand, to prevent the grain being scattered upon the headland, while the machine is turning round; this he will do with great ease, by continuing his right hand upon the rail between the handles, and applying his left arm under the left handle, in order to lift the coulters out of the ground while the machine is turning round.\n\nIf there be any difficulty in using the machine, it consists in driving it straight. As to the person who attends the machine, he cannot possibly commit any errors, except such as are wilful, particularly as he sees at one view the whole process of the business, viz., that the coulters make the drills of a proper depth; that the funnels continue open to convey the grain or seed into the drills; that the rakes or harrows cover the grain sufficiently; and when feed is wanting in the lower boxes B, which he cannot avoid seeing, he readily supplies them from the upper boxes A, by applying his hand, as the machine goes along, to the lever C. The lower boxes B should not be suffered to become empty before they are supplied with feed, but should be kept nearly full, or within an inch or so of the edge of the box.\n\nIf chalk lines are made across the backs of the coulters, at such a distance from the ends as the feed should be deposited in the ground (viz., about two inches for wheat, and from two to three for spring corn), the person that attends the machine will be better able to ascertain the depth the feed should be deposited in the drills, by observing, as the machine goes along, whether the chalk lines are above or below the surface of the land; if above, a proper weight must be applied to the lever L, which will force the coulters into the ground; if below, the lever L and weight must be reversed, which will prevent their sinking too deep.\n\nIn different parts of the kingdom, lands or ridges are of different sizes; where the machine is too wide for the land, one or more funnels may occasionally be stopped with a little loose paper, and the feed received into such funnel returned at the end of the land, or sooner if required, into the upper seed-box. But for regularity and expedition, lands consisting of so many feet wide from outside to outside, as the machine contains coulters, when fixed at twelve inches distance, or twice or three times the number, &c., are best calculated for the machine. In wet soils or strong clays, lands or ridges of the width of the machine, and in dry soils, of twice the width, are recommended. For sowing of narrow high-ridged lands, the outside coulters should be let down, and the middle ones raised, so that the points of the coulters may form the same curve that the land or ridge forms. And the loose soil harrowed down into the furrows should be returned to the edges of the lands or ridges from whence it came, by a double mouldboard or other plough, whether the land be wet or dry.\n\nClover or other leys, intended to be sown by the machine, should be ploughed a deep strong furrow and well harrowed, in order to level the surface, and to get as much loose soil as possible for the coulters to work in; and when sown, if any of the feed appears in the drills uncovered by reason of the stiff texture of the soil, or toughness of the roots, a light harrow may be taken over the land, once in a place, which will effectively cover the feed, without displacing it all in the drills. For sowing leys, a considerable weight must be applied to the lever L, to force the coulters into the ground; and a set of wrought-iron coulters, well fleeted, and made sharp at the front edge and bottom, are recommended; they will pervade the soil more readily, consequently require less draught, and expedite business more than adequate to the additional expense.\n\nFor every half acre of land intended to be sown by the machine with the feed of that very valuable root (carrot), one bushel of sawdust, and one pound of carrot-feed, should be provided; the sawdust should be made dry, and sifted to take out all the lumps and chips, and divided into eight equal parts or heaps; the carrot-feed should likewise be dried, and well rubbed between the hands, to take off the beards, so that it may separate readily; and being divided into eight equal parts or heaps, one part of the carrot-feed must be well mixed with one part of the sawdust, and so on, till all the parts of carrot-feed and sawdust are well mixed and incorporated together; in which state it may be sown very regularly in drills at twelve inches distance, by the cups or ladles No. 2. Carrot-feed resembling sawdust very much in its size, roughness, weight, adhesion, &c., will remain mixed as above during the sowing; a ladleful of sawdust will, upon an average, contain three or four carrot-feeds, by which means the carrot-feed cannot be otherwise than regular in the drills. In attempting to deposit small feeds near the surface, it may happen that some of the feeds may not be covered with soil; in which case, a lighter roller may be drawn over the land after the feed is sown, which will not only cover the feeds, but will also, by levelling the surface, prepare the land for an earlier hoeing than could otherwise have taken place.\n\nIt has always been found troublesome, sometimes impracticable, to sow any kind of grain or seeds (even broad-cast) in a high wind. This inconvenience is entirely obviated by placing a screen of any kind of cloth, or a rack, supported by two uprights nailed to the sides of the machine, behind the funnels, which will prevent the grain or seed being blown out of its direction in falling from the ladles into the funnels. Small pipes of tin may also be put on to the ends of the funnels, to convey the grain or seed so near the surface of the land, that the highest wind shall not be able to interrupt its descent into the drills.\n\nReflecting the use of the machine, it is frequently remarked by some people not conversant with the properties of matter and motion, that the soil will close after the coulters, before the seed is admitted into the drills. Whereas the very contrary is the case; for the velocity of the coulters in passing through the soil, is so much greater than the velocity with which the soil closes up the drills by its own spontaneous gravity, that the incisions or drills will be constantly open for three or four inches behind the coulters; by which means, it is morally impossible (if the points of the funnels stand directly behind the coulters) that the seed, with the velocity it acquires in falling through the funnels, shall not be admitted into the drills.\nFig. 12. is a new constructed simple hand-hoe, by which one man will effectually hoe two chain acres per day, earthing up the soil at the same time to the rows of corn or pulse, so as to cause roots to issue from the first joint of the stem, above the surface of the land, which otherwise would never have existed.\n\nThis hoe is worked much in the same manner as a common Dutch hoe, or icicle, is worked in gardens. The handle is elevated or depressed, to suit the size of the person that works it, by means of an iron wedge being respectively applied to the upper or under side of the handle that goes into the socket of the hoe.\n\nThe wings or moulding plates of the hoe, which are calculated to earth up the foil to the rows of corn, so as to cause roots to issue from the first joint of the stem above the surface, which otherwise would not have existed, should never be used for the first hoeing, but should always be used for the last hoeing, and used or not used, at the option of the farmer, when any intermediate hoeing is performed.\n\nSummary of the Operations necessary in executing the New Husbandry with the Plough.\n\n1. It is indispensably necessary that the farmer be provided with a drill and hoe-plough.\n\n2. The new husbandry may be begun either with the winter or spring corn.\n\n3. The land must be prepared by four good ploughings, given at different times, from the beginning of April to the middle of September.\n\n4. These ploughings must be done in dry weather, to prevent the earth from kneading.\n\n5. The land must be harrowed in the same manner as if it were sowed in the common way.\n\n6. The rows of wheat should be sowed very straight.\n\n7. When the field is not very large, a line must be strained across it, by which a rill may be traced with a hoe for the horse that draws the drill to go in; and when the rows are sown, 50 inches must be left between each rill. But, when the field is large, stakes at five feet distance from each other must be placed at the two ends. The workman must then trace a small furrow with a plough that has no mouldboard, for the horse to go in that draws the drill, directing himself with his eye by the stakes.\n\n8. The sowing should be finished at the end of September, or beginning of October.\n\n9. The furrows must be traced the long way of the land, that as little ground as possible may be lost in headlands.\n\n10. The rows, if it can be done, should run down the slope of the land, that the water may get the easier off.\n\n11. The feed-wheat must be plunged into a tub of lime-water, and stirred, that the light corn may come to the surface and be skimmed off.\n\n12. The feed must be next spread on a floor, and frequently stirred, till it is dry enough to run through the valves of the hopper of the drill.\n\n13. To prevent smut, the feed may be put into a ley of ashes and lime.\n\n14. Good old feed-wheat should be chosen in preference to new, as it is found by experience not to be subject to smut.\n\n15. After the hoppers of the drill are filled, the horse must go slowly along the furrow that was traced. That a proper quantity of seed may be sown, the aperture of the hopper must be suited to the size of the grain.\n\n16. As the drill is seldom well managed at first, the field should be examined after the corn has come up, and the deficiencies be supplied.\n\n17. Upon wet soils or strong clays, wheat should not be sowed more than two inches deep, on any account whatever; nor less than two inches deep on dry soils. From two to three inches is a medium depth for all spring corn. But the exact depth at which grain should be sowed in different soils, from the lightest sand to the strongest clay, is readily ascertained only by observing at what distance under the surface of the land, the secondary or coronal roots are formed in the spring.\n\n18. Stiff lands, that retain the wet, must be stirred or hoed in October. This should be done by opening a furrow in the middle of the intervals, and afterwards filling it up by a furrow drawn on each side, which will raise the earth in the middle of the intervals, and leave two small furrows next the rows, for draining off the water, which is very hurtful to wheat in winter.\n\n19. The next stirring must be given about the end of March, with a light plough. In this stirring the furrows made to drain the rows must be filled up by earth from the middle of the interval.\n\n20. Some time in May, the rows must be evened; which, though troublesome at first, soon becomes easy, as the weeds are soon kept under by tillage.\n\n21. In June, just before the wheat is in bloom, another stirring must be given with the plough. A deep furrow must be made in the middle of the intervals, and the earth thrown upon the sides of the rows.\n\n22. When the wheat is ripe, particular care must be taken, in reaping it, to trample as little as possible on the ploughed land.\n\n23. Soon after the wheat is carried off the field, the intervals must be turned up with the plough, to prepare them for the seed. The great furrow in the middle must not only be filled, but the earth raised as much as possible in the middle of the intervals.\n\n24. In September, the land must be again sowed with a drill, as above directed.\n\n25. In October, the stubble must be turned in for forming the new intervals; and the same management must be observed as directed in the first year.\n\nWe pretend not to determine whether the old or new husbandry be preferable in every country. With regard to this point, the climate, the situation of particular land, skill and dexterity in managing the machinery, the comparative expense in raising crops, and many other circumstances must be accurately attended to before a determination can be given.\n\nTo give an idea of the arguments by which the drill husbandry was originally supported, we shall here take notice of a comparative view of the old and new methods of culture which was furnished for the editors of Mr Tull's Horse-hoeing Husbandry, by a gentleman who for some years practiced both in a country where the soil was light and chalky, like that from which he drew his observations. It is necessary to remark, that in the new husbandry every article is stated at its full value, and the crop of each year is four bushels short of the other; though,\nthough, in several years experience, it has equalled and generally exceeded those in the neighbourhood in the old way.\n\n\"An estimate of the expense and profit of 10 acres of land in 20 years.\n\nI. In the old way.\n\nFirst year, for wheat, costs 33l. 5s. viz.\n\n| L. s. d. | L. s. d. |\n|----------|----------|\n| First ploughing, at 6s. per acre | 3 0 0 |\n| Second and third ditto, at 8s. per acre | 4 0 0 |\n| Manure, 30s. per acre | 15 0 0 |\n\nTwo harrowings, and sowing, at 2s. 6d. per acre - 1 5 0\n\nSeed, three bushels per acre, at 4s. per bushel - 6 0 0\n\nWeeding, at 2s. per acre, 1 0 0\n\nReaping, binding, and carrying, at 6s. per acre - 3 0 0\n\nSecond year, for barley, costs 11l. 6s. 8d. viz.\n\nOnce ploughing at 6s. per acre - 3 0 0\n\nHarrowing and sowing, at 1s. 6d. per acre - 0 15 0\n\nWeeding, at 1s. per acre - 0 10 0\n\nSeed, four bushels per acre, at 2s. per bushel - 4 0 0\n\nCutting, raking, and carrying, at 3s. 2d. per acre - 1 11 8\n\nGrass-seeds, at 3s. per acre - 1 10 0\n\nThird and fourth years, lying in grass, cost nothing: so that the expense of ten acres in four years comes to 44l. 11s. 8d. and in twenty years to 222 18 4\n\nFirst year's produce is half a load of wheat per acre, at 7l. 35 0 0\n\nSecond year's produce is two quarters of barley per acre, at 1l. 20 0 0\n\nThird and fourth years grass is valued at 1l. 10s. per acre 15 0 0\n\nSo that the produce of ten acres in four years is 70 0 0\n\nAnd in twenty years it will be 350 0 0\n\nDeduct the expense, and there remains clear profit on ten acres in twenty years by the old way 127 1 8\n\nII. In the new way.\n\nFirst year's extraordinary expense is, for ploughing and manuring the land, the same as in the old way, 1l. 22 0 0\n\nPloughing once more, at 4s. per acre - 2 0 0\n\nSeed, nine gallons per acre, at 4s. per bushel - 2 5 0\n\nDrilling, at 7d. per acre - 0 5 10\n\nHand-hoeing and weeding, at 2s. 6d. per acre - 1 5 0\n\nHorse-hoeing six times, at 10s. per acre - 5 0 0\n\nReaping, binding, and carrying, at 6s. per acre - 3 0 0\n\nThe standing annual charge on ten acres, is 13 15 10\n\nTherefore the expense on ten acres in twenty years is 275 16 8\n\nAdd the extraordinary of the first year, and the sum is 297 16 8\n\nThe yearly produce is at least two quarters of wheat per acre, at 1l. 8s. per quarter; which on ten acres in twenty years, amounts to 560 0 0\n\nTherefore, all things paid, there remains clear profit on ten acres in twenty years by the new way 262 3 4\n\n\"So that the profit on ten acres of land in twenty years, in the new way, exceeds that in the old by in favour of 135l. 1s. 8d. and consequently is considerably more than double thereof; and ample encouragement to practise a scheme, whereby so great advantage will arise from so small a quantity of land, in the compass of a twenty-one years lease; one year being allowed, both in the old and new way, for preparing the ground.\n\n\"It ought withal to be observed, that Mr Tull's husbandry requires no manure at all, though we have here, to prevent objections, allowed the charge thereof for the first year; and moreover, that though the crop of wheat from the drill-plough is here put only at two quarters on an acre, yet Mr Tull himself, by actual experiment and measure, found the produce of his drilled wheat crop amounted to almost four quarters on an acre.\"\n\nIt appears also from a comparative calculation of expense and profit between the drill and common husbandry, taken from Mr Baker's report to the Dublin Society of his experiments in agriculture for the year 1765, that there is a clear profit arising upon an Irish acre of land in 15 years in the drill husbandry of 52l. 3s. 11d. and in the common husbandry of 27l. 19s. 2d.; and therefore a greater profit in the drilled acre in this time of 24l. 4s. 9d. which amounts to 1l. 12s. 3½d. per annum. From hence he infers, that in every 15 years the fee-simple of all the tillage-lands of the kingdom is lost to the community by the common course of tillage. In stating the accounts, from which their result is obtained, no notice is taken of fences, water-cutting the land, weeding and reaping, because these articles depend on a variety of circumstances, and will, in general, exceed in the common husbandry those incurred by the other.\n\nBesides, the certainty of a crop is greater in this new way.\nway than in the old way of sowing; for most of the accidents attending wheat crops, are owing to their being late sown, which is necessary to the farmer in the old way; but in the horse-hoeing method the farmer may plough two furrows whereon the next crop is to stand immediately after the first crop is off. In this manner of husbandry, the land may be ploughed dry and drilled wet, without any inconvenience; and the seed is never planted under the furrow, but placed just at the depth which is most proper, that is, at about two inches; in which case it is easy to preserve it, and there is no danger of burying it. Thus the seed has all the advantage of early sowing, and none of the disadvantages that may attend it in the other way, and the crop is much more certain than by any other means that can be used.\n\nThe condition in which the land is left after the crop, is no less in favour of the horse-hoeing husbandry than all the other articles. The number of plants is the great principle of the exhausting of land. In the common husbandry, the number is vastly greater than in the drilling way, and three plants in four often come to nothing, after having exhausted the ground as much as profitable plants; and the weeds which live to the time of harvest in the common way, exhaust the land no less than so many plants of corn, often much more. The horse-hoeing method destroys all the weeds in the far greater part of the land, and leaves that part unexhausted and perfectly fresh for another crop. The wheat plants being also but a third part of the number at the utmost of these in the sowing way, the land is so much the less exhausted by them; and it is very evident from the whole, that it must be, as experience proves that it is, left in a much better condition after this than after the common husbandry.\n\nThe farmers who are against this method object, that it makes the plants too strong, and that they are more liable to the blacks or blights of insects for that reason; but as this allows that the hoeing can, without the use of dung, give too much nourishment, it is very plain that it can give enough; and it is the farmer's fault if he do not proportion his pains so as to have the advantage of the nourishment without the disadvantages. It is also objected, that as hoeing can make poor land rich enough to bear good crops of wheat, it may make good land too rich for it. But if this should happen, the sowing of wheat on it may be let alone a while, and in the place of it the farmer may have a crop of turnips, carrots, cabbages, and the like, which are excellent food for cattle, and cannot be over-nourished: or, if this is not chosen, the land, when thus made too rich, may soon be sufficiently impoverished by sowing corn upon it in the common old way.\n\nThe method of horse-hoeing husbandry, so strongly recommended by Mr Tull, is objected to by many on account of the largeness of the intervals which are to be left between the rows of corn. These are required to be about five feet wide; and it is thought that such wide spaces are so much lost earth, and that the crop is to be so much the less for it. But it is to be observed, that the rows of corn separated by these intervals need not be single; they may be double, triple, or quadruple, at the pleasure of the farmer; and four rows thus standing as one will have the five feet interval but one-fourth of its bigness as to the whole quantity, and it will be but as fifteen inch intervals to plant in single rows. Corn that is sown irregularly in the common way, seems indeed to cover the ground better than that in rows; but this is a mere deception; for the stalks of corn are never so thick as when they come out of one plant, or as when they stand in a row; and a horse-hoed plant of corn will have 20 or 30 stalks in a piece of ground of the same quantity, where an unhoeed plant will have only two or three stalks. If these stalks of the hoed plant were separated and planted over the intervals, the whole land would be better covered than it is in the common way; and the truth is, that though these hoed fields seem to contain a much less crop than the common sown fields, yet they in reality do contain a much greater. It is only the different placing that makes the sown crop seem the larger, and even this is only while both crops are young.\n\nThe intervals are not lost ground, as is usually supposed, but when well horse-hoed they are all employed in the nourishment of the crop; the roots of the plants in the adjoining rows spreading themselves through the whole interval, and drawing such nourishment from it, that they increase accordingly. When the plants stand in the scattered way, as in common sowing, they are too close to one another; each robs its neighbour of part of their nourishment, and consequently the earth is soon exhausted, and all the plants half starved. The close standing of them also prevents the benefit of after-tilling, as the hoe cannot be brought in, nor the ground by any means stirred between them to give it a new breaking, and consequently afford them new food.\n\nExperiments have abundantly proved, that in large grounds of wheat where the different methods have been tried, those parts where the intervals were largest have produced the greatest crops, and those where hoeing was used without dung have been much richer than those where dung was used without hoeing. If it were possible that plants could stand as thick, and thrive as well over the whole surface of the ground as they do in the rows separated by these large intervals, the crops of corn so produced would be vastly greater than any that have been heard of; but the truth is, that plants receive their growth not according to the ground they stand on, but to the ground they can extend their roots into; and therefore a single row may contain more plants than a large interval can nourish, and therefore the same number that stand in that row, and no more than these, could be nourished, if scattered over the whole interval: and they would be much worse nourished in that way; because while the interval is void, the earth may be stirred about them, and new roots will be formed in great numbers from every one broken by the instruments, and new nourishment laid before these roots by the breaking the particles of earth, by which the plants will have supplies that they cannot have when scattered over the whole surface, because the ground is then all occupied, and cannot be moved between the plants.\n\nAll soils and all situations are not equally proper for this method of planting in rows, with large intervals between and hoeing between. The lightest soils seem to be best for it, and the tough and wet clays the worst. Such soils proper for this work are those that lie on the sides of hills are also less proper than others for this work.\nThis method is not so proper in common fields, but that not in respect of the soil, but of the husbandry of the owners, who are usually in the old way, and change the species of corn, and make it necessary to fallow every second, third, or fourth year. Nevertheless it has been found by later experiments, that the intervals betwixt the rows of plants, as recommended by Mr Tull, were too great, perhaps double of what they should be in the most profitable method of culture; by which means much less crops are obtained than might be produced at nearly the same expense. This has rendered the profits of the drill method much less than they would have been in a more judicious practice, and consequently, has proved a great disadvantage to it in comparison with the broad-cast. Mr Tull was led into this, partly from the want of more perfect instruments for hoeing, and of ploughs proper for drilling.\n\nTo the preceding statements, the following observations by Sir John Anstruther, published among the Select Papers of the Bath Society, may not be improperly subjoined.\n\nThe slow progress which the drill-husbandry has made in many parts of Great Britain since Mr Tull's time, he observes, has been principally owing to the want of proper drill-ploughs. Before drilling can become general, those ploughs must be simple, such as a common ploughman accustomed to use strong instruments can use without breaking, and such also as common workmen can easily make or repair. Mathematical accuracy he considers as not required for delivering the seed; for it matters very little whether there be a quarter of a peck more or less sown, if it be delivered with tolerable regularity. He therefore had a plough made, according to his own directions, by a common plough-wright, of sufficient strength for any land made fit for turnips or wheat. It was tried on very rough ground unfit for sowing, in order to ascertain its strength; and it had been used for eight years without its needing any repair. It is a double drill-plough, which sows two ridges at a time, the horse going in the furrow between them, and of course does not tread upon the ground intended to be sown; which with a single drill must be the case, and does much harm by the horse's feet sinking and making holes in the fine ground, which retain the water, and hurt the wheat when young.\n\nHe proceeds to observe, \"That having read Mr Forbes upon the extensive practice of the new husbandry, and some other authors, who gave a more clear and distinct account of the different operations in drilling than had heretofore been given, I wished to try them, and to adapt my plough to sow the quantities therein directed. It was, however, adjusted to sow a smaller quantity, and the seed was not steeped.\n\n\"Not having ground so proper as I wished, it was drilled on the side of a field, the soil of which was light and sandy, and in such bad order, that the preceding crop was a very indifferent one. It was therefore manured with a compost-dunghill.\n\n\"After croft-ploughing and manuring, it was laid into four and a half feet ridges, then harrowed and drilled with one peck and a half of wheat on an acre and a quarter, which is nearly one peck and a fifth per English acre. It was drilled the 27th of October, and rolled after drilling. The crop was late in its appearance, and very backward in the spring.\n\n\"March 31st, it was horse-hoed one furrow from the rows.\n\n\"April 8th, it was hand-hoed and weeded in the rows.\n\n\"May 15th, horse-hoed again, laying a furrow back to the rows.\n\n\"June 2nd, horse-hoed from the rows.\n\n\"June 12th, hand-hoed the third time.\n\n\"July 14th, horse-hoed to the rows.\n\n\"At this last hoeing, as many of the ears were beaten down into the intervals by wind and rain, a man went before the horse-hoe, and turned the ears back into their proper place.\n\n\"The crop, when reaped and threshed, yielded me 36 bushels on one acre and a quarter, which is 28 bushels and three pecks per acre; and the produce from one peck and half 96 for one.\n\n\"As the produce appeared so great, from land in such bad order, it was carefully measured again, and found to be right. But this increase, though great, was not so large as Mr Crake of Glasgow had without dung.\n\n\"Mr Randal says, 'It is an experimental fact, that on a fine loam exquisitely prepared, 144 bushels have been produced from one acre. And, I believe, it is not known what the increase may be brought to in rich lands by high cultivation.'\n\n\"Some years since, I had beans dropt alternately with potatoes, at two feet distance in the rows, which were three feet apart, and ploughed in the intervals. The land adjoining was sown with beans and peas, which were a good crop; but those sown among the potatoes a better one. I pulled one stem of the beans planted with the potatoes, which had three branches rising from the bottom, and it produced 225 beans. In all the trials of drilled beans, most of the stems had two branches, with many pods upon each.—From these and other instances, I believe it is not yet known to what increase grain may be brought by drilling, good cultivation, and manure.\n\n\"Horse-hoeing is certainly preferable to clove drilling or hand-hoeing; but the latter is superior to broad-cast.\n\n\"Horse-hoeing the full depth increases to crop, by making it tiller or branch more than it otherwise would do; and the advantage is distinctly observable every hoeing, by the colour of the grain. It prepares the ground for the next crop, at the same time that it increases the crop growing, which hand-hoeing does not, although it may destroy the weeds. Thus drilled ground is kept in a loose open state to receive the benefit of the influence of the air and weather, which broad-cast has not; and it is evident, from certain experience, that crops may be drilled many years to good advantage without manure.\n\n\"Suppose the crops only 20 bushels per acre, what course of broad-cast crops will give 5l. an acre for the course? But suppose they are dugged the same as any ground in the most approved course, there is the greatest reason to expect as much as in the above experiment,\"\nment, which is 28½, and at 5s. per bushel amounts to 71. 3s. gd.\n\nCalculations may be of service to those who wish to try drilling, and have few books to direct them.\n\nOne acre is 10 chains long, of 660 feet, or 220 yards long, and one yard broad, containing 4840 square yards. Then if the ridge is four feet six inches, this makes 24 ridges and three feet to spare. This length of 220 yards multiplied by 14 (the number of ridges), gives a length of yards 3082, to which add 146 for the spare three feet, and it will be 3226 yards. And as two rows are drilled on a ridge, the number of rows will be in length 6452 yards; but as a deduction of 172 yards must be made for the head ridges, suppose three yards each, &c., the whole length to be sown will be 6280 yards clear. Now a gallon (Winchester) holds about 80,000 grains. The quantity recommended to be drilled by Mr. Forbes and others, being six gallons, or two-thirds of a bushel per acre, is nearly 75 grains to a yard, or 26 to a foot. But in my experiment, by this calculation, it was only about 11 grains to a foot; which is quite sufficient, if the seed be good, and it be not destroyed by vermin.\n\nNow with regard to the quantity of land this drill-plough may sow; if a horse walks at the rate of two miles per hour, he goes 16 miles in eight hours, or 28,460 yards. As he sows two ridges at once, this is seven lengths, and two-thirds per acre, or 1686 yards to sow an acre, being nearly 17 acres in a day.\n\nFour horse-hoeings are calculated equal to two ploughings. In plain ploughing they suppose the ridge is ploughed with four furrows, or eight for twice ploughing. The four horse-hoeings are eight furrows, equal to two ploughings.\n\nMr. Tull directs four hoeings, and Mr. Forbes five.\n\nIn November, when the plant has four blades, drill. In March, deep, and nearer the rows than the former; both these hoeings should be from the rows.\n\nHand-hoeing when it begins to spindle, if the earth be crumbly, to the rows.\n\nWhen it begins to bloom, from the rows, but as near to them as in the second hoeing.\n\nWhen done blooming, to ripen and fill the grain, to the rows.\n\nThe last hoeing Mr. Tull does not direct, but Mr. Forbes advises it, as being of essential service in filling the grain, and saving trouble in making the next feed-furrows. They advise the patent or towing-plough for horse-hoeing; and the expense is calculated by Mr. Crack at one guinea per acre, reaping included.\n\nBut let us suppose the following, which are the prices in the county I live in (Fife).\n\n| Ploughing to form the ridges | L. s. d. |\n|----------------------------|---------|\n| Harrowing                  | 0 4 0   |\n| Four hoeings, equal to two ploughings | 0 8 0   |\n| Sowing                     | 0 0 4   |\n| Hand-hoeing twice          | 0 8 0   |\n| Seed, one peck and a half, at 5s. a bushel | 0 1 10 |\n\nWhole expense per acre, L. 1 2 6\n\nDrill-husbandry is, as a good writer has justly defined it, \"the practice of a garden brought into the field.\" Every man of the least reflection must be sensible, that the practice of the garden is much better than that of the field, only a little more expensive; but if (as is the case) this extra expense be generally much more than repaid by the superior goodness and value of drilled crops, it ought to have no weight in comparing the two modes of husbandry.\n\nIn the broad-cast method the land is often sown in bad tilth, and always scattered at random, sometimes by very unskillful hands. In drilling, the land must be in fine order; the seed is set in trenches drawn regularly, all of nearly an equal depth, and that depth suited to the nature of each kind of seed. These seeds are also distributed at proper distances, and by being equally and speedily covered, are protected from vermin and other injuries; so that the practice of the garden is here exactly introduced into the field.\n\nIn the broad-cast method the seed falls in some places too thick, in others too thin; and being imperfectly covered, a part of it is devoured by vermin which follow the lower; another part is left exposed to rain or frost, or to heats, which greatly injure it. When harrowed, a great part of it (small seeds especially) is buried too deep, that if the soil be wet, it perishes before it can vegetate.\n\nAgain: When thus sown, there is no meddling with the crop afterwards, because its growth is irregular. The soil cannot be broken to give it more nourishment, nor can even the weeds be destroyed without much inconvenience and injury.\n\nBut in the drill-husbandry the intervals between the rows, whether double or single, may be horse-hoed; and thereby nourishment may repeatedly be given to the plants, and the weeds almost totally destroyed.\n\nThe very same effects which digging has upon young shrubs and trees in a garden, will result from horse-hoeing in a field, whether the crop be corn, or pulse: For the reason of the thing is the same in both cases, and being founded in nature and fact, cannot ever fail.\n\nIn drilling, no more plants are raised on the soil than it can well support; and by dividing and breaking the ground they have the full advantage of all its fertility.\n\nThe plough prepares the land for a crop, but goes no further; for in the broad-cast husbandry it cannot be used; but the crop receives greater benefit from the tillage of the land by the horse-hoe, while it is growing, than it could in the preparation. No care in tilling the land previous to sowing can prevent weeds rising with the crop; and if these weeds be not destroyed while the crop is growing, they will greatly injure it.\n\nIn the broad-cast husbandry this cannot be done; but in drilling, the horse-hoe will effect it easily.\n\nAnd what adds to the farmer's misfortune is, that the most pernicious weeds have seeds winged with down, which are carried by the wind to great distances; such as thistles, low-thistles, colts-foot, and some others.\n\nIf the expense of horse-hoeing be objected, there are two answers which may very properly be made: The first is, that this expense is much less than that of hand-hoeing were it practicable, or of hand-weeding. The second is, that it is more than repaid by the quantity of seed saved by drilling; to say nothing of the extra quantity and goodness of the crops, which are generally self-evident.\n\nUpon the whole: If the particular modes of cultivating land by the new husbandry should, after all, be considered...\nconsidered as perhaps too limited to be universally adopted; yet it has been of great use in raising suspicions concerning the old method, and in turning the views of philosophers and farmers towards improving in general. Many real improvements in agriculture have been the consequences of these suspicions; and as this spirit of inquiry remains in full vigour, a solid foundation is laid for expecting still further improvements in this useful art.\n\nIt may be proper here to remark, however, that the drill-husbandry is by no means a modern European invention. It is now used in the Carnatic, and in all probability has existed among the industrious nations of Flax and India from a very early period. It is used not only for all grains, but also for the culture of tobacco, cotton, and the castor-oil plant. Besides the drill-plough, and the common plough, the Indians use a third, with a horizontal share, which immediately follows the drill-plough at work. It is set into the earth, about the depth of 7 or 8 inches, and passes under three drills at once. It operates by agitating the earth, so as to make the sides of the drills fall in and cover the seed, which it does so effectually as scarcely to leave any traces of a drill.\n\nPART II. CULTIVATION OF VEGETABLES MORE PROPERLY ARTICLES OF COMMERCE.\n\nThese in general are such as cannot be used for food; and are principally flax, hemp, rape, hops, and timber of various kinds. Of each of these we shall treat particularly in the following sections.\n\nSECT. I. Of Flax and Hemp.\n\nFlax is cultivated not only with a view to the common purposes of making linen, but for the sake of its seed also; and thus forms a most extensive article of commerce, all the oil used by painters, at least for common purposes, being extracted from this seed. The cake which remains after the extraction of the oil is in some places used as a manure, and in others sold for fattening of cattle. In the Vale of Gloucester, Mr Marshall informs us, that it is, next to hay, the main article of stall-fattening; though the price is now become so great, that it probably leaves little or no profit to the consumer, having within a few years risen from three guineas to six and sixpence, and the lowest price being five guineas per ton; and even this is lower than it was lately. Hence some individuals have been induced to try the effect of linseed itself boiled to a jelly, and mixed with flour, bran, or chaff, with good success, as Mr Marshall has been informed; and even the oil itself has been tried for the same purpose in Herefordshire. Though this plant is in universal culture over the whole kingdom, yet it appears by the vast quantity imported, that by far too little ground is employed in that way. As Mr Marshall takes notice of its culture only in the county of Yorkshire, it probably does not make any great part of the husbandry of the other counties of which he treats; and even in Yorkshire he tells us, that its cultivation is confined to a few districts. The kind cultivated there is that called blea line, or the blue or lead-coloured flax, and this requires a rich dry soil for its cultivation. A deep, fat, sandy loam is perhaps the only soil on which it can be cultivated with advantage. If sown upon old corn land, it ought to be well cleaned from weeds, and rendered perfectly friable by a summer-fallow. Manure is seldom or ever set on for a line crop; and the soil proceeds generally of a single ploughing. The seed-time is in the month of May, but much depends on the state of the soil at the time of sowing. \"It should neither be wet nor dry; and the surface ought to be made as fine as that of a garden bed. Not a clod of the size of an egg should remain unbroken.\" Two bushels of seed are usually sown upon an acre; the surface, after being harrowed, is sometimes raked with garden or hay rakes; and the operation would be still more complete if the clods and other obstructions, which cannot be easily removed, were drawn into the interfurrows. A light hand-roller used between the final raking and harrowing would much assist this operation. The chief requisite during the time of vegetation is weeding, which ought to be performed with the utmost care; and for this reason it is particularly requisite that the ground should be previously cleaned as well as possible, otherwise the expense of weeding becomes too great to be borne, or the crop must be considerably injured. It is an irreparable injury, if, through a dry season, the plants come up in two crops; or if by accident or mismanagement they be too thin. The goodness of the crop depends on its running up with a single stalk without branches; for wherever it ramifies, there the length of the line terminates; and this ramification is the consequence of its having too much room at the root, or getting above the plants which surround it. The branches are never of any use, being unavoidably worked off in dressing; and the stem itself, unless it bear a due proportion to the length of the crop, is likewise worked off among the refuse. This ramification of the flax will readily be occasioned by clods on the ground when sown. A second crop is very seldom attended with any profit; for being overgrown with the spreading plants of the first crop, it remains weak and short, and at pulling time is left to rot upon the land.\n\nFlax is injured not only by drought but by frost, and is sometimes attacked even when got five or six inches high, by a small white flug, which strips off the leaves to the top, and the stalks bending with their weight are thus sometimes drawn into the ground. Hence, if the crop does not promise fair at weeding time, our author advises not to belabor farther labour and expense upon it. A crop of turnips or rape will generally pay much better than such a crop of flax. The time of flax-harvest in Yorkshire is generally in the latter end of July or beginning of August.\n\nOn the whole, our author remarks, that \"the goodness of the crop depends in some measure upon its tall's length; and this upon its evenness and closeness upon marks on the ground. Three feet high is a good length, and the\nFlax and hemp afford more lime and fewer slivers than a thick one. A tall thick set crop is therefore desirable. But unless the land be good, a thick crop cannot attain a sufficient length of item. Hence the folly of sowing flax on land which is unfit for it. Nevertheless, with a suitable soil, a sufficiency of feed evenly distributed, and a favourable season, flax may turn out a very profitable crop. The flax crop, however, has its disadvantages: it interferes with harvest, and is generally believed to be a great exhaust of the soil, especially when its seed is suffered to ripen. Its cultivation ought therefore to be confined to rich grassland districts, where harvest is a secondary object, and where its exhaustion may be rather favourable than hurtful to succeeding arable crops, by checking the too great rankness of rich fresh broken ground.\n\nIn the fifth volume of Bath Papers, Mr Bartley, near Bristol, gives an account of the expenses and produce of five acres of flax cultivated on a rich loamy land. The total expense was £21. 13s. 4d.; the produce was ten packs of flax at £1. 5s. value £21. 10s. 3½ bushels of linseed at £5. value £8. 15s. the net profit therefore was £81. 11s. 8d. or £41. 13s. 4d. per acre. This gentleman is of opinion that flax-growers ought to make it their staple article, and consider the other parts of their farm as in subordination to it.\n\nIn the second volume of Bath Papers, a Dorsetshire gentleman, who writes on the culture of hemp and flax, gives an account somewhat different from that of Mr Marshall. Instead of exhausting crops, he maintains that they are both ameliorating crops, if cut without feeding; and as the best crops of both are raised from foreign seed, he is of opinion that there is little occasion for raising it in this country. A crop of hemp, he informs us, prepares the land for flax, and is therefore clear gain to the farmer. \"That these plants impoverish the soil,\" he repeats, \"is a mere vulgar notion, devoid of all truth.\"—The best historical relations, and the verbal accounts of honest ingenious planters, concur in declaring it to be a vain prejudice, unsupported by any authority; and that these crops really meliorate and improve the soil.\" He is likewise of opinion, that the growth of hemp and flax is not necessarily confined to rich soils, but that they may be cultivated with profit also upon poor sandy ground, as well as rich if a little expense be laid out in manuring it. \"Spalding-moor in Lincolnshire is a barren land; and yet with proper care and culture it produces the best hemp in England, and in large quantities. In the Isle of Axholme, in the same county, equal quantities are produced; for the culture and management of it is the principal employ of the inhabitants; and, according to Leland, it was so in the reign of Henry VIII. In Marshland the soil is a clay or strong warp, thrown up by the river Ouse, and of such a quality, that it cracks with the heat of the sun, till a hand may be put into the chinks; yet if it be once covered with the hemp or flax before the heats come on, the ground will not crack that summer. When the land is sandy, they first sow it with barley, and the following spring they manure the stubble with horse or cow dung, and plough it under. Then they sow their hemp or flax, and harrow it in with a light harrow, having short teeth. A good crop destroys all the weeds, and makes it a fine fallow for flax in the spring. As soon as the flax is pulled, they prepare the ground for wheat. Lime, marl, and the mud of ponds, is an excellent compost for hemp-lands.\"\n\nOur author takes notice of the vast quantity of flax and hemp, not less than 11,000 tons, imported in the year 1763 into Britain; and complains that it is not raised in the island, which he thinks might be done, though it would require 60,000 acres for the purpose. He observes, that the greater part of those rich marshy lands lying to the west of Mendip hills are very proper for the cultivation of hemp and flax; and if laid out in this manner could not fail of turning out highly advantageous both to the landholders and the public at large. \"The vast quantities of hemp and flax (says he) which have been raised on lands of the same kind in Lincolnshire marshes, and the fens of the Isle of Ely and Huntingdonshire, are a full proof of the truth of my affeation. Many hundreds of acres in the above-mentioned places, which, for pasture or grazing, were not worth more than twenty or twenty-five shillings per acre, have been readily let at £4. the first year, £3. the second, and £2. the third. The reason of this supposed declining value of land, in proportion to the number of years sown with flax, is, that it is usual with them to feed it for the purpose of making oil, that being the principal cause of the land being thereby impoverished.\n\nIt is certain, however, that the quantity of hemp exported from St Petersburgh in British ships has continued to increase, so that in 1785 the quantity of hemp exported from Petersburgh in British ships was as follows:\n\n| Poods |\n|-------|\n| Of clean hemp | 1,028,791 |\n| Outlot | 37,382 |\n| Half clean | 18,374 |\n| Hemp codille | 19,251 |\n\nThere are 63 poods to a ton, consequently the whole amounted to 17,695 tons; and it is said that this quantity has since been tripled and quadrupled. It is therefore an object of great national importance to consider, whether flax and hemp might not be profitably reared in our own country without producing any alarm concerning their tendency to exhaust the soil. With this view we shall here state the substance Mr Darro's report made by Mr Darro, British consul at Prussia, in 1789, to the lords of the Committee of Council for Trade, concerning the method of cultivating flax and hemp in Prussia, Russia, and Poland.\n\nA black, not morassily open gravelly soil is preferred, as flax and hemp become exuberant and coarse on too rich a soil. To ascertain the proper middle degree of strength of soil, previous crops of grain are taken. On a vigorous soil wheat is first sown; then rye, barley, oats; and last of all flax or hemp. Two successive crops of hemp are taken if the land is intermediately dugged. For one crop of flax, it is not dugged at all. On a soil of less strength, flax and hemp are sown immediately after a winter crop of rye, the land being ploughed in autumn, if the weather allows, if not, in spring. It is then harrowed and manured, and again ploughed.\nploughed immediately before sowing. Another winter crop of rye may immediately be sown in the same field after drawing the flax or hemp, but after the flax; dung is in this case necessary. A field that has been laid down in fallow, if only ploughed up, yields a better crop of flax than if manured and cultivated in the above or any other way. Flax and hemp are sown from the 25th of May to the 10th of June, and the flax is reaped in the end of August, and hemp in the end of September.\n\nAs to their effects on the soil, no kind of grain can be sown immediately after a crop of flax without dunging, but after one of hemp, any grain, and even hemp itself, may be sown without manure. Hemp cleans the ground by suffocating, by its broad leaves, all sorts of weeds or undergrowth; but flax must be weeded once or twice before it blooms. Flax is plucked when the stalk becomes yellowish, the pods brown, and the seed hard and full bodied. For finer flax, the stalk is pulled while yet green; but the seed is then sacrificed, and fit only for crushing for oil, of which it produces a small quantity. Hemp is also plucked or drawn when the stalk and pods have changed colour. If the flax is very dry when plucked, the seed is stripped off immediately; if not, it is allowed to dry on the field. Seed-pods are spread thinly on a floor, where they are turned twice a day, till so dry that they open of themselves; when it is threshed and cleaned like other grain. To gain the hemp-seed, the hemp itself, when plucked, is set on end against any convenient place. The roots and top-ends are then cut off. The roots are thrown away, and the top-ends are threshed out and cleaned. The seed is apt to be spoiled by remaining in a moist state for any length of time.\n\nAs soon as the seed has been gained, the flax and hemp are steeped in water till the flax separate from the rind, and the hemp till the hull springs from the stalk. In soft water, in warm weather, nine or ten days are sufficient for this purpose. In hard water, with cold weather, from fourteen days to three weeks are requisite. Stagnate is preferred to running water; but fish ponds and the drinking places of cattle must be avoided, as the fish would be destroyed, and the water would be rendered unwholesome and unpalatable to the cattle; but a muddy or flimsy bottom is preferred. In the southern provinces of Poland, as Volhynia, Podolia, &c., steeping is not practised, on the supposition that it weakens the hull and darkens the colour, though this idea seems to have no foundation.\n\nAfter being taken out of the steep, the flax is dried on a grass field; after which it is gathered up into small stacks; but the hemp, instead of being spread out on a field, is set up against the walls of buildings till it is also dried, after which they are both housed.\n\nIt is generally understood in these countries, that the cultivation of flax and hemp is more profitable than that of any kind of grain.\n\nTo this we shall add a concise statement of the mode of cultivating flax in Ireland. A good crop of flax is there expected from any strong clays that are fit for the growth of corn; but an open black loamy soil, enriched by having lain long in pasture, is preferable. The ground must be in fine tilth, and as free from weeds as possible. Potatoes usually precede flax, though turnips, beans, or any manured crop, are a good preparation; but the first or second crop after pasture is preferred to any of these. Stubble lands, that have been long in tillage, may, by proper preparation, bring a crop; but it is apt to fail in such situations, the stalks turning to a reddish colour called firing before it ripens; upon which it must immediately be pulled. Two bushels of feed are used to the English acre, unless for the purpose of a very fine manufacture; in which case a large quantity of feed is used, and the flax is pulled very green. The season of sowing is the first fine weather after the middle of March. The most approved mode of culture is in beds about six feet broad, covering the feed about an inch and a half deep, with earth shoveled out of the furrows; but the most ordinary mode is to sow on common ridges, and to harrow in the feed. Before the flax is five inches high it should be carefully hand-weeded; and, if any part lodges, it should be turned over. The produce is usually worth 7l. sterling the English acre. The crop should stand till the lower part of the stalk becomes yellowish, and the under leaves begin to wither, unless the seed is to be preserved, which is done by ridding it through an iron comb, and the flax may be steeped immediately after it is pulled. Turf-bog water, if clear, answers well, but foul stagnate water stains the flax. Too pure a spring is injurious. A refer dog in clay is preferred. The time of lying in the steep depends upon the quality of the water and the state of the weather. It is dried on grass by being spread thin; artificial heat has been recommended for drying flax; but no good form of it has been suggested.\n\nIn addition to what is here stated, the compiler of Sheep on this article accounts it proper to take notice of a mode employed of weeding flax that has frequently been practised in weed flax in Scotland. It consists of turning a flock of sheep at large into the field. They will not taste the young flax plants, but they carefully search for the weeds which they devour. It may also be remarked, that for drying flax in wet seasons, the steam kiln formerly proposed would be a valuable instrument.\n\nSect. II. Rape or Cole-Seed.\n\nThis, as well as linseed, is cultivated for the purpose of making oil, and will grow almost anywhere. Mr Hazard informs us, that in the north of England Bath Farmers pare and burn their pasture lands, and then pers, vol. iv. sow them with rape after one ploughing; the crop commonly standing for seed, which will bring from 25l. to 30l. per last (80 bushels). Poor clay, or stone-Advantage braith land, will frequently produce from 12 to 16 or cultivat-18 bushels per acre, and almost any fresh or virgining rape-earth will yield one plentiful crop; so that many in feed. The northern counties have been raised, by cultivating this feed, from poverty to the greatest affluence. The feed is ripe in July or the beginning of August; and the thrashing of it out is conducted with the greatest mirth and jollity.\n\nThe rape being fully ripe, is first cut with sickles, and Of cutting then laid thin upon the ground to dry; and when in and thrash-proper condition for thrashing, the neighbours are invited, who readily contribute their assistance. The tape-feed, thrashing is performed on a large cloth in the middle of\nof the field, and the seed put into the sacks and carried home. It does not admit of being carried from the field in the pod in order to be thrashed at home, and therefore the operation is always performed in the field; and by the number of affiants procured on this occasion, a field of 25 acres is frequently thrashed out in one day. The straw is burnt for the sake of its alkali, the ashes being said to equal the best kind of those imported from abroad.\n\nThe proper time for sowing rape is the month of June; and the land should, previous to the sowing, be twice well ploughed. About two pounds of seed are sufficient for an acre; and, according to our author, it should be cast upon the ground with only the thumb and two fore fingers; for if it be cast with all the fingers, it will come up in patches. If the plants come up too thick, a pair of light harrows should be drawn along the field length-wise and cross-wise; by which means the plants will be equally thinned; and when the plants which the harrows have pulled up are withered, the ground should be rolled. A few days after the plants may be set out with a hoe, allowing 16 or 18 inches distance betwixt every two plants.\n\nMr Hazard strongly recommends the transplanting of rape, having experienced the good effects of it himself. A rood of ground, sown in June, will produce as many plants as are sufficient for 10 acres; which may be planted out upon ground that has previously borne a crop of wheat, provided the wheat be harvested by the middle of August. One ploughing will be sufficient for these plants; the best of which should be selected from the seed-plot, and planted in rows two feet alunder and 16 inches apart in the rows. As rape is an excellent food for sheep, they may be allowed to feed upon it in the spring; or the leaves might be gathered, and given to oxen or young cattle: fresh leaves would sprout again from the same stalks, which in like manner might be fed off by ewes and lambs in time enough to plough the land for a crop of barley and oats. Planting rape in the beginning of July, however, would be most advantageous for the crop itself, as the leaves might then be fed off in the autumn, and new ones would appear in the spring. Our author disapproves the practice of sowing rape with turnips, as the crops injure one another. \"Those who look for an immediate profit (says he), will undoubtedly cultivate rape for seed; but perhaps it may answer better in the end to feed it with sheep: the fat ones might kill it over first, and afterwards the lean or store-sheep might follow them, and be folded thereon; if this is done in the autumn season, the land will be in good heart to carry a crop of wheat; or where the rape is fed off in the spring, a crop of barley might follow. In either case rape is profitable to the cultivator; and when it is planted, and well earthered round the stems, it will endure the severest winter; but the same cannot be advanced in favour of that which is sown broad-cast.\"\n\nCole-feed is cultivated in Brabant, in the following manner, according to the Abbé Mann. \"It is sown about the middle of July, and the young plants are transplanted about the end of September. This is done with a narrow spade sunk into the ground, and moved with the hand forwards and backwards; which simple motion, makes a sufficient opening to receive the plant; a boy or girl follow the labourer with plants, and putting one of them into each hole, treads against it to Seed, Calico it up. If the plantation is done with the plough, &c., and are covered with the earth turned up with the succeeding furrow. Sometimes, after the cole-feed is planted, the foot of the stalks is covered, by means of a common spade or hoe, with the earth near it, which furnishes nourishment for the plants during winter, by the crumbling of these little clods of earth over the roots. The cole-feed is reaped about midsummer or later, according as the season is more or less advanced; it is left on the field for ten or twelve days after it is cut, and then thrashed on a kind of sail-cloth, spread on the ground for that purpose, and the seed carried in sacks to the farm. When the crop is good, a binder produces about forty rakers of 80lbs. weight each. It is to be observed, that the ground whereon cole-feed is to be planted, must be dunged and twice ploughed the same year it is put in use.\"\n\nSect. III. Coriander-Seed.\n\nThis is used in large quantities by distillers, druggists, and confectioners, and might be a considerable object to such farmers as live in the neighbourhood of great towns; but the price is very variable, viz. from 16s. to 42s. per cwt. In the 4th volume of Bath Pa., Mr Bartley gives an account of an experiment made on this seed, which proved very successful. Ten perch of good sandy loam were sown with coriander on the 23rd of March 1783. Three pounds of seed were sufficient for this spot; and the whole expense amounted only to 5s. 10d. The produce was 87 pounds of seed, which, valued at 3d. yielded a profit of 5s. 11½d. or 1s. 1l. 18s. 4½d. per acre. He afterwards made several other experiments on a larger scale; but none of the crops turned out so well, though all of them afforded a good profit.\n\nSect. IV. Canary-Seed.\n\nThis is cultivated in large quantity in the Isle of Culture of Thanet, where it is said they have frequently 20 bushels canary-seed to an acre. Mr Bartley, in the month of March 1783, sowed half an acre of ground, the soil a mixture of loam and clay, but had only eight bushels and a half, or 17 bushels per acre. With this produce, however, he had a profit of 4l. 2s. 3½d. per acre.\n\nSect. V. Woad.\n\nThe use of this in dyeing is well known, and the consumption is so great, that the raising of the plant might undoubtedly be an object to an husbandman, provided he could get it properly manufactured for the dyers, and could overcome their prejudices. At present, the growing of this plant is in a manner monopolized by some people in particular places, particularly at Keynsham near Bristol in England. Mr Bartley Woad informs us, that in a conversation he had with these cultivators, the latter asserted, that the growth of woad was peculiar to their soil and situation. The soil about this place is a blackish heavy mould, with a considerable proportion of clay, but works freely: that of Bridlington,\nBrillington, where Mr Bartley resides, a hazel sandy loam; nevertheless, having sowed half an acre of this soil with woad-feed, it throve so well, that he never saw a better crop at Keynsham. Having no apparatus, however, or knowledge of the manufacture, he suffered it to run to seed, learning only from the experiment, that woad is very easily cultivated, and that the only difficulty is the preparing it for the market.\n\n**Sect. VI. Hops.**\n\nThe uses of these as an ingredient in malt liquors, are well known. Formerly, however, they were supposed to possess such deleterious qualities, that the use of them was forbidden by act of parliament in the reign of James VI. But though this act was never repealed, it does not appear that much regard was ever paid to it, as the use of hops has still continued, and is found not to be attended with any bad effects on the human constitution. The only question, therefore, is, How far the raising a crop of them may be profitable to an husbandman? and indeed this seems to be very doubtful.\n\nMr Arthur Young, in a Fortnight's Tour through Kent and Essex, informs us, that at Castle Hedingham he was told by a Mr Rogers, who had a considerable hop-plantation, that four acres of hop-ground cost him upwards of £120, and that the usual expenses of laying out an acre of ground in this way amounted to £34.6s. By a calculation of the expenses of an acre in Kent, it appeared that the money sunk to plant an acre there amounted to £321.8s.6d.; that the annual expense was £231, and the profit no more than £11.8s.1d. In another place, he was informed by a Mr Potter, who cultivated great quantities of hops, that if it were not for some extraordinary crops which occurred now and then, nobody would plant them. In Essex, the expenses of a hop-plantation are still greater than those we have yet mentioned; an acre many years ago requiring £75. to lay it out on hops, and now not less than £100. the annual expense being estimated at £31.1s. while the produce commonly does not exceed £21.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Stow-market in this county, Mr Young informs us, there are about 200 acres planted with hops, but \"18 or 20 acres grubbed up within two years, owing to the badness of the times.\" Here they are planted on a black loofe moor, very wet and boggy; and the more wet the better for the crop, especially if the gravel, which constitutes the bottom, be not more than three feet from the surface. In preparing the ground for hops, it is formed into beds, 16 feet wide, separated from each other by trenches. In these beds they make holes six feet aunder, and about 12 inches diameter, three rows upon a bed. Into each hole they put about half a peck of very rotten dung or rich compost; scatter earth upon it, and plant seven sets in each; drawing earth enough to them afterwards to form something of a hillock. A hop garden, Mr Young informs us, \"will last almost forever, by renewing the hills that fail, to the amount of about a score annually, but it is reckoned better to grub up and new-plant it every 20 or 25 years.\"\n\nIn this volume of the Annals, Mr Young informs us, that \"one profit of hop-land is that of breaking it up.\" Mr Potter grubbed up one garden, which failing, he ploughed and sowed barley, the crop great; then mazagan beans, two acres of which produced 16 breaking quarters and five bushels. He then sowed it with up hop-wheat, which produced 13 quarters and four bushels; and an half; but since that time the crops have not been greater than common. The same gentleman has had 10 quarters of oats after wheat.\" In the ninth volume of the same work, however, we have an account of an experiment by Mr Le Bland of Sittingbourne in Kent, of grubbing up 12 acres of hop-ground, which was not attended with any remarkable success. Part of the hops were grubbed up in the year 1781, and mazagan beans sown in their stead; but by reason of the seed being bad, and the dry summer, the crop turned out very indifferent. Next year the remainder of the hops were grubbed up, and the whole 12 acres sown with wheat; but still the crop turned out very bad, owing to the wet summer of that year. It was next planted with potatoes, which turned out well; and ever since that time the crops have been good. This gentleman informs us, that the person who had the hop-ground above-mentioned did not lose less by it than £500.\n\nThe culture of hops seems to be confined in a great measure to the southern counties of England; for Mr hops in Norfolk mentions it as a matter of surprise, that in Norfolk he saw a \"tolerably large hop garden.\" The proprietor informed him, that three or four years before there had been 10 acres of hops in the parish (Blowfield) where he resided; which was more than could be collected in all the rest of the county; but at that time there were not above five: and the culture was daily declining, as the crops, owing to the low price of the commodity, did not defray the expense.\n\nFrom all this it appears, that hops are perhaps the most uncertain and precarious crop on which the husbandman can bestow his labour. Mr Young is of opinion, that some improvement in the culture is necessary; but he does not mention any, excepting that of planting them in epaliers. This method was recommended both by Mr Rogers and Mr Potter above-mentioned. The former took the hint from observing, that a plant which had been blown down, and afterwards shot out horizontally, always produced a greater quantity than those which grew upright. He also remarks, that hops which are late picked carry more next year than such as are picked early; for which reason he recommends the late picking. The only reason for picking early is, that the hops appear much more beautiful than the others.\n\n**Sect. VII. Cultivation of Fruit.**\n\nIn Herefordshire and Gloucestershire the cultivation of fruit for the purpose of making a liquor from the juice, forms a principal part of their husbandry. In Devonshire also considerable quantities of this kind of liquor are made, though much less than in the two counties above-mentioned.\n\nThe fruits cultivated in Herefordshire and Gloucestershire are, the apple, the pear, and the cherry. From the two first are made the liquors named cider and perry;\nbut though it is probable that a liquor of some value might be made from cherries also, it does not appear to have ever been attempted. Mr Marshall remarks, that nature has furnished only one species of pears and apples, viz., the common crab of the woods and hedges, and the wild pear, which is likewise pretty common. The varieties of these fruits are entirely artificial, being produced not by feed, but by a certain mode of culture; whence it is the business of those who wish to improve fruit therefore, to catch at superior accidental varieties; and having raised them by cultivation to the highest perfection of which they are capable, to keep them in that state by artificial propagation. Mr Marshall, however, observes, that it is impossible to make varieties of fruit altogether permanent, though their duration depends much upon management. \"A time arrives (says he) when they can no longer be propagated with success. All the old fruits which raised the fame of the liquors of this country are now lost, or so far on the decline as to be deemed irrecoverable. The red-freak is given up; the celebrated fir-apple is going off; and the squab-pear, which has probably furnished this country with more champagne than was ever imported into it, can no longer be got to flourish: the stocks canker, and are unproductive. In Yorkshire similar circumstances have taken place: several old fruits which were productive within my own recollection are lost; the stocks cankered and the trees would no longer come to bear.\"\n\nOur author controverts the common notion among orchard-men, that the decline of the old fruits is owing to a want of fresh grafts from abroad, particularly from Normandy, from whence it is supposed that apples were originally imported into this country. Mr Marshall, however, thinks, that these original kinds have been long since lost, and that the numerous varieties of which we are now possessed were raised from seed in this country. He also informs us, that at Ledbury he was shown a Normandy apple tree, which, with many others of the same kind, had been imported immediately from France. He found it, however, to be no other than the bitter-sweet, which he had seen growing as a neglected wilding in an English hedge.\n\nThe process of raising new varieties of apples, according to Mr Marshall, is simple and easy. \"Elect (says he) among the native species individuals of the highest flavour; sow the seeds in a highly enriched seed-bed. When new varieties, or the improvement of old ones, are the objects, it may perhaps be eligible to use a frame or stove; but where the preservation of the ordinary varieties only is wanted, an ordinary loamy soil will be sufficient. At any rate, it ought to be perfectly clean at least from root weeds, and should be double dug from a foot to 18 inches deep. The surface being levelled and raked fine, the seeds ought to be scattered on about an inch under and covered about half an inch deep with some of the finest mould previously raked off the bed for that purpose. During summer the young plants should be kept perfectly free from weeds, and may be taken up for transplantation the ensuing winter; or if not very thick in the seedbed, they may remain in it till the second winter.\n\nThe nursery ground ought also to be enriched, and double dug to the depth of 14 inches at least; though 18 or 20 are preferable. The seedling plants ought to be sown agreeably to the strength of their roots, that they may rise evenly together. The top or downward roots should be taken off, and the longer side rootlets shortened. The young trees should then be planted in rows three feet under, and from 15 to 18 inches distant in the rows; taking care not to cramp the roots, but to lead them evenly and horizontally among the mould. If they be intended merely for stocks to be grafted, they may remain in this situation until they be large enough to be planted out; though, in strict management, they ought to be re-transplanted two years before their being transferred into the orchard, \"in fresh but unmanured double-dug ground, a quincunx four feet apart every way.\" In this second transplantation, as well as in the first, the branches of the root ought not to be left too long, but to be shortened in such a manner as to induce them to form a globular root, sufficiently small to be removed with the plant; yet sufficiently large to give it firmness and vigour in the plantation.\n\nHaving proceeded in this manner with the seed-bed, our author gives the following directions. \"Select choosing from among the seedlings the plants whose wood and the plants' leaves wear the most apple-like appearance. Transplant these into a rich deep soil in a genital situation, letting them remain in this nursery until they begin to bear. With the seeds of the fairest, richest, and best flavoured fruit repeat this process; and at the same time, or in due season, engraft the wood which produced this fruit on that of the richest, sweetest, best-flavoured apple: repeating this operation, and transferring the subject under improvement from one tree and root to another, as richness, flavour, or firmness may require; continuing this double mode of improvement until the desired fruit be obtained. There has, no doubt, been a period when the improvement of the apple and pear was attended to in this country; and should not the same spirit of improvement revive, it is probable that the country will, in a course of years, be left destitute of valuable kinds of these two species of fruit; which, though they may in some degree be deemed objects of luxury, long custom seems to have ranked among the necessaries of life.\"\n\nIn the fourth volume of Bath Papers, Mr Grimwood supposes the degeneracy of apples to be rather imaginary than real. He says, that the evil complained of is not a real decline in the quality of the fruit, but of apples in the tree; owing either to want of health, the season, soil, mode of planting, or the stock they are grafted on, being too often raised from the seed of apples in the same place or county. I have not a doubt in my own mind, but that the trees which are grafted on the stocks raised from the apple pips are more tender than those grafted on the real crab-stock; and the seasons in this country have, for many years past, been unfavourable for fruits, which add much to the supposed degeneracy of the apple. It is my opinion, that if planters of orchards would procure the trees grafted on real crab-stocks from a distant country, they would find their account in doing much overbalance the extra expense of charge and carriage.\n\nIn the same volume, Mr Edmund Gilliagwater affirms as a reason for the degeneracy of apples the water's mixture of various farina, from the orchards being too near each other. In consequence of this notion, he\nhe also thinks that the old and best kinds of apple trees are not lost, but only corrupted from being planted too near bad neighbours: \"Remove them (says he) to a situation where they are not exposed to this inconvenience, and they will immediately recover their former excellency.\" This theory, however, is not supported by a single experiment.\n\nIn this volume also Mr Richard Samuel expresses his concern at the \"present neglect of orchards, where the old trees are decaying; without proper provision being made for the succeeding age: for if a farmer plants fresh trees (which does not frequently happen), there is seldom any care taken to propagate the better sorts, as his grafts are usually taken promiscuously from any ordinary kind most easily procured in the neighbourhood.\" His remedy is to collect grafts from the best trees; by which means he supposes that the superior kinds of fruit would soon be recovered. To a care of this kind he attributes the superiority of the fruit in the neighbourhood of great towns to that in other places.\n\nWith regard to the method of cultivating fruit trees, it is only necessary to add, that while they remain in the nursery, the intervals between them may be occupied by such kitchen-stuff as will not crowd or overshadow the plants; keeping the rows in the meantime perfectly free from weeds. In pruning them, the leader should be particularly attended to. If they shoot double, the weaker of the contending branches should be taken off; but if the leader be lost, and not easily recoverable, the plant should be cut down to within a hand's breadth of the soil, and a fresh stem trained. The undermost boughs should be taken off by degrees, going over the plants every winter; but taking care to preserve heads of sufficient magnitude not to draw the stems up too tall, which would make them feeble in the lower part. The stems in Herefordshire are trained to fix feet high; but our author prefers seven, or even half a rod in height. A tall-stemmed tree is much less injurious to what grows below it than a low-headed one, which is itself in danger of being hurt, at the same time that it hurts the crop under it. The thickness of the stem ought to be in proportion to its height; for which reason a tall stock ought to remain longer in the nursery than a low one. The usual size at which they are planted out in Herefordshire is from four to six inches girt at three feet high; which size, with proper management, they will reach in seven or eight years. The price of these stocks in Herefordshire is 1s. 6d. each. Our author met with one instance of crabstocks being gathered in the woods with a good prospect of success.\n\nIn Herefordshire it is common to have the ground of the orchards in tillage, and in Gloucestershire in grafts; which Mr Marshall supposes to be owing to the difference between the soil of the two counties; that of Herefordshire being generally arable, and Gloucestershire grafts land. Trees, however, are very destructive, not only to a crop of corn, but to clover and turnips; though tillage is favourable to fruit trees in general, especially when young. In grafts grounds their progress is comparatively slow, for want of the earth being stirred about them, and by being injured by the cattle, especially when low-headed and drooping. After they begin to bear, cattle ought by all means to be kept away from them, as they not only destroy all the fruit within their reach, but the fruit itself is dangerous to the cattle, being apt to stick in their throats and choke them. These inconveniences may be avoided, by eating the fruit grounds bare before the gathering season, and keeping the boughs out of the way of the cattle: but Mr Marshall is of opinion, that it is wrong to plant orchards in graft land. \"Let them (says he) lay their old orchards to grafts; and if they plant, break up their young orchards to arable. This will be changing the course of husbandry, and be at once beneficial to the land and the trees.\"\n\nOur author complains very much of the indolent and careless method in which the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire farmers manage their orchards. The natural enemies of fruit trees (says he) are:\n\n1. A redun-complained dancy of wood.\n2. The milletoe.\n3. Moths.\n4. Spring frosts.\n5. Blights.\n6. Insects.\n7. An excess of fruit.\n8. Old age.\n\n1. A redundancy of wood is prejudicial, by reason of the barren branches depriving those which bear fruit wood how of the nourishment which ought to belong to them. Remedied. A multitude of branches also give the winds such an additional power over the tree, that it is in perpetual danger of being overthrown by them: trees are likewise thus injured by the damps and want of circulation of air, so that only the outer branches are capable of bringing fruit to maturity. \"It is no uncommon sight (says he) to see trees in this district, with two or three tiers of boughs pressing down hard upon one another, with their twigs so intimately interwoven, that even when the leaves are off, a small bird can scarcely creep in among them.\n\n2. The milletoe in this country is a great enemy to Milletoe the apple tree. It is easily pulled out with hooks in dry frosty weather, when, being brittle, it readily breaks off from the branches. It likewise may be applied to a profitable purpose, sheep being as fond of it as of ivy.\n\n3. Moths can only be got the better of by industry in Moths clearing the trees of it; and in Kent there are people fruit trees, who make it their profession to do so.\n\n4. Spring frosts, especially when they suddenly succeed rain, are great enemies to fruit trees; dry frosts, only keep back the blossoms for some time. Art can give no farther assistance in this case than to keep the trees in a healthy and vigorous state, so as to enable them to throw out a strength of bud and blossom; and by keeping them thin of wood, to give them an opportunity of drying quickly before the frost let in.\n\n5. Blight is a term, as applied to fruit trees, which Blights an Mr Marshall thinks is not understood. Two bearing uncertain years, he remarks, seldom come together; and he is of opinion, that it is the mere exhausting of the trees by the quantity of fruit which they have carried one year, that prevents them from bearing any the next. The only thing therefore that can be done in this case is, to keep the trees in a healthy and vigorous a state as possible.\n\n6. Insects destroy not only the blossoms and leaves, but some of them also the fruit, especially pears. Proposed of the year 1783 much fruit was destroyed by wasps, destroying Mr Marshall advises to put a price upon the female wasps in the spring; by which these mischiefous insects would perhaps be exterminated, or at least greatly lessened.\nPart II.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nTimber Trees.\n\n7. An excess of fruit stunts the growth of young trees, and renders all in general barren for two or three years; while in many cases the branches are broken off by the weight of the fruit; and in one case Mr. Marshall mentions, that an entire tree had sunk under its burden. To prevent as much as possible the bad effects of an excess of fruit, Mr. Marshall recommends \"to graft in the boughs,\" and when fully grown, to thin the bearing branches; thus endeavouring, like the gardener, to grow fruit every year.\"\n\n8. Though it is impossible to prevent the effects of old age, yet by proper management the natural life of fruit trees may be considerably prolonged. The most eligible method is to graft stocks of the native crab in the boughs. The decline of the tree is preceded by a gradual decline of fruitfulness, which takes place long before the tree manifests any sign of decay. During this decline of fruitfulness, there is a certain period when the produce of a tree will no longer pay for the ground it occupies; and beyond this period it ought by no means to be allowed to stand. In the Vale of Gloucester, however, our author saw an instance of some healthy bearing apple trees, which then had the second tops to the same items. The former tops having been worn out, were cut off, and the stumps faw-grafted. Our author observes, that the pear tree is much longer lived than the apple, and ought never to be planted in the same ground. He concludes with the following general observation: \"Thus considering fruit trees as a crop in husbandry, the general management appears to be this: Plant upon a recently broken-up worn-out faward. Keep the soil under a state of arable management, until the trees be well grown; then lay it down to grass, and let it remain in faward until the trees be removed, and their roots be decayed: when it will again require a course of arable management.\"\n\nSect. VIII. Of Timber Trees.\n\nThe importance and value of these are so well known, that it is superfluous to say anything on that subject at present: notwithstanding this acknowledged value, however, the growth of timber is slow, and the returns for planting so distant, that it is generally supposed for a long time to be a positive loss, or at least to be attended with no profit. This matter, however, when properly considered, will appear in another light. There are four distinct species of woodlands; viz., woods, timber groves, coppices, and woody wastes. The woods are a collection of timber trees and underwood; the timber groves contain timber trees without any underwood; and the coppices are collections of underwood alone. All these turn out to advantage sooner or later, according to the quick or slow growth of the trees, and the situation of the place with respect to certain local advantages. Thus in some places underwood is of great consequence, as for rails, hoops, stakes, fuel, &c. and by reason of the quickness of its growth it may be accounted the most profitable of all plantations. An offer-bed will yield a return of profit the second or third year, and a coppice in 15 or 20 years; while a plantation of oaks will not arrive at perfection in less than a century. This last period is so long, that it may not unreasonably be supposed likely to deter people from making plantations of this kind, as few are willing to take any trouble for what they are never to see in perfection. It must be remembered, however, that though the trees themselves do not come to perfection in a shorter time, the value of the ground will always increase in proportion to their age. Thus, says one author upon this subject, \"we have some knowledge of a gentleman now living, who during his lifetime has made plantations, which in all probability will be worth to his son as much as his whole estate, handsome as it is. Supposing that those plantations have been made 50 or 60 years, and that in the course of 20 or 30 more they will be worth 50,000l.; may we not say, that at present they are worth some 20,000l. or 30,000l.? Mr. Pavier, in the 4th volume of Bath Papers, computes the value of 50 acres of oak timber in 100 years to be 12,100l., which is nearly 50s. annually per acre; and if we consider that this is continually accumulating, without any of that expense or risk to which annual crops are subject, it is probable that timber planting may be accounted one of the most profitable articles in husbandry. Evelyn calculates the profit of 1000 acres of oak-land in 150 years, at no less than 679,000l.; but this is most probably an exaggeration. At any rate, however, it would be improper to occupy, especially with timber of such slow growth, the grounds which either in grass or corn can repay the trouble of cultivation with a good annual crop.\n\nIn the fourth volume of the Bath Papers, Mr. Wagstaffe recommends planting as an auxiliary to cultivation. He brings an instance of the success of Sir William Jerringham, who made trial of \"the most unpromising ground perhaps that any successful planter has hitherto attempted.\" His method was to plant beech trees at proper distances among Scotch firs, upon otherwise barren heaths. \"These trees (says Mr. Wagstaffe), in a soil perhaps without clay or loam, with the heathy sod trenched into its broken strata of sand or gravel, under the protection of the firs, have laid hold, though slowly, of the soil; and accelerated by the superior growth of the firs, have proportionally risen, until they wanted an enlargement of space for growth, when the firs were cut down.\" He next proceeds to observe, that when the firs are felled, their roots decay in the ground; and thus furnish by that decay a new support to the soil on which the beeches grow: by which means the latter receive an additional vigour, as well as an enlargement of space and freer air; the firs themselves, though cut down before they arrived at their full growth, being also applicable to many valuable purposes.\n\nIn the 6th volume of Annals of Agriculture, we find the culture of trees recommended by Mr. Harries; and he informs us, that the larch is the quickest growing tree, and the most valuable of all the famous timber trees; but unless there be pretty good room allowed for the branches to stretch out on the lower part of the trunk, it will not arrive at any considerable size; and this observation, he says, holds good of all pyramidal trees. Scotch firs may be planted between them, and pulled out after they begin to obstruct the growth of the larch. Some of these larches he had seen planted about 30 years before, which at 5 feet distance from the ground, measured from 4 feet to 5 feet 6 inches in circumference.\nThe most barren grounds, he says, would answer for these trees, but better soil is required for the oaks. In this paper he takes notice of the leaves of one of his plantations of oaks having been almost entirely destroyed by insects; in consequence of which they did not increase in bulk as usual: but another which had nearly escaped these ravages, increased at an average 1 inch in circumference. A tree 4 feet round (says he), that has timber 20 feet in length, gains by this growth a solid foot of timber annually, worth one shilling at least, and pays 5 per cent. for standing. It increases more as the tree gets from 5 to 6 feet round.\n\nI have a reasonable hope to infer from my inquiry, that I have in my groves 3000 oaks that pay me one shilling each per annum, or £150l. a-year. My poplars have gained in circumference near two inches, and a Wych-elm and witch elm as much. I have lately been informed, that the smooth cut of a holly tree, that measures 20 inches and upwards round, is worth to the cabinet-makers 2s. 6d. per foot.\n\nThe following table shows the increase of trees in 21 years from their first planting. It was taken from the marquis of Lansdowne's plantation, begun in the year 1765, and the calculation made on the 1st of July 1786. It is about fix acres in extent, the soil partly a swampy meadow upon a gravelly bottom.\n\nThe measures were taken at 5 feet above the surface of the ground; the small firs having been occasionally drawn for posts and rails, as well as rafters for cottages; and when peeled of the bark, will stand well for seven years.\n\n| Height in Feet | Circumference in Feet. Inch. |\n|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Lombardy poplar | 60 to 80                      |\n| Arbeal          | 50 to 70                      |\n| Plane           | 50 to 60                      |\n| Acacia          | 50 to 60                      |\n| Elm             | 40 to 60                      |\n| Chestnut        | 30 to 50                      |\n| Weymouth pines  | 30 to 50                      |\n| Cluffet ditto   | 30 to 50                      |\n| Scotch fir      | 30 to 50                      |\n| Spruce ditto    | 30 to 50                      |\n| Larch           | 50 to 60                      |\n\nFrom this table it appears, that planting of timber-trees, where the return can be waited for during the space of 20 years, will undoubtedly repay the original profits of planting, as well as the interest of the money laid out; which is the better worth the attention of a proprietor of land, as the ground on which they grow may be supposed good for very little else. From a comparative table of the growth of oak, ash, and elm timber, given in the 11th volume of the Annals of Agriculture, it appears that the oak is by much the slowest grower of the three.\n\nWith respect to the growth of underwood, which in some cases is very valuable, it is to be remarked, that in order to have an annual fall of it, the whole quantity of ground, whatever its extent may be, ought to be divided into annual sowings. The exact number of sowings must be regulated by the uses to which it is intended to be put. Thus if, as in Surrey, stakes, eddiers, and hoops are saleable, there ought to be eight or ten annual sowings; or, if, as in Kent, hops are demanded, 14 or 15 will be required; and if, as in Yorkshire, rails are wanted, or, as in Gloucestershire, cordwood be most marketable, 18 or 20 sowings will be necessary to produce a succession of annual falls. Thus the business, by being divided, will be rendered less burdensome: a certain proportion being every year to be done, a regular set of hands will, in proper season, be employed; and by beginning upon a small scale, the errors of the full year will be corrected in the practice of the second, and those of the second in that of the third. The produce of the intervals will fall into regular courses; and when the whole is completed, the falls will follow each other in regular succession. The greatest objection to this method of sowing woodlands is the extraordinary trouble in fencing: but this objection does not hold if the sowings lie at a distance from one another; on the contrary, if they lie together, or in plots, the entire plot may be inclosed at once; and if it contain a number of sowings, some subdivisions will be necessary, and the annual sowings of these subdivisions may be fenced off with hurdles, or some other temporary contrivance; but if the adjoining land be kept under the plough, little temporary fencing will be necessary. It must be observed, however, that in raising a woodland from seeds, it is not only necessary to defend the young plants against cattle and sheep, but against hares and rabbits also: so that a close fence of some kind is absolutely necessary.\n\nWith regard to the preparation of the ground for raising timber, it may be observed, that if the soil be of a stiff clayey nature, it should receive a whole year's fallow as for wheat; if light, a crop of turnips may be taken; but at all events it must be made perfectly clean before the tree-seeds be sown, particularly from perennial root weeds; as, after the seeds are sown, the opportunity of performing this necessary business is in a great measure lost. If the situation be moist, the soil should be gathered into wide lands, sufficiently round to let the water run off from the surface, but not high. The time of sowing is either the month of October or March; and the method as follows: \"The Method of land being in fine order, and the season favourable, the sowing whole should be sown with corn or pulse adapted to the season of sowing: if in autumn, wheat or rye may be the crop; but if in spring, beans or oats. Whichever of these three species be adopted, the quantity of seed ought to be less than usual, in order to give a free admission of air, and prevent the crop from lodging. The sowing of the grain being completed, that of the tree-seeds must be immediately set about. These are to be put in drills across the land: acorns and nuts should be dibbled in, but keys and berries scattered in trenches or drills drawn with the corner of a hoe, in the manner that gardeners sow their peas. The distance might be a quarter of a statute rod, or four feet and one inch and a half. A landchain should be used in setting out the drills, as not being liable to be lengthened or shortened by the weather. It is readily divided into rods; and the quarters may be easily marked.\n\nThe species of underwood to be sown must be determined by the consumption of it in the neighbourhood of the plantation. Thus, if stakes, hoops, &c., be in request, the oak, hazel, and ash, are esteemed:\nTimber as underwood. Where charcoal is wanted for iron forges, beech is the prevailing underwood. The oak, box, birch, &c. are all in request in different countries, and the choice must be determined by the prevailing demand. As the keys of the ash sometimes lie two or even three years in the ground, it will be proper to have the places where they are sown distinguished by some particular marks, to prevent them from being disturbed by the plough after harvest; as a few beans scattered along with them, if the crop be oats; or oats, if the crop be beans. The crop should be reaped, not mown, at harvest time, and be carried off as fast as possible. Between harvest and winter, a pair of furrows should be laid back to back in the middle of each interval, for meliorating the next year's crop, and laying the seedling plants dry; while the stubble of the unploughed ground on each side of the drills will keep them warm during the winter. The next year's crop may be potatoes, cabbages, turnips, or if the first was corn, this may be beans; if the first was beans, this may be wheat drilled. In the spring of the third year the drills which stole the first year must be looked over, and the vacancies filled up from, those parts which are thickest; but the drills of the ash should be let alone till the fourth year. The whole should afterwards be looked over from time to time; and this, with cultivating the intervals, and keeping the drills free from weeds, will be all that is necessary until the tops of the plants begin to interfere.\n\nThe crops may be continued for several years; and if they only pay for the expenses, they will still be of considerable advantage by keeping the ground flirmed, and preserving the plants from hares and rabbits. Even after the crops are discontinued, the ground ought still to be flirmed, alternately throwing the mould to the roots of the plants, and gathering it into a ridge in the middle of the interval. The best method of doing this is to split the ground at the approach of winter in order to throw it up to the trees on both sides; this will preserve the roots from frost; gather it again in the spring, which will check the weeds, and give a fresh supply of air: split again at midsummer, to preserve the plants from drought: gather, if necessary, in autumn, and split as before at the approach of winter. The spring and midsummer ploughings should be continued as long as a plough can pass between the plants.\n\nWhenever the oaks intended for timber are in danger of being drawn up too slender for their height, it will be necessary to cut off all the rest at the height of about an handbreadth above the ground; and those designed to stand must now be planted at about two rods distant from each other, and as nearly a quincunx as possible. The second cutting must be determined by the demand there is for the underwood; with only this proviso, that the timber stands be not too much crowded by it; for rather than this should be the case, the coppice should be cut, though the wood may not have reached its most profitable state. What is here said of the method of rearing oak trees in woods, is in a great measure applicable to that of raising other trees in timber groves. The species most usually raised in these are the ash, elm, beech, larch, spruce fir, Weymouth pine, poplar, willow, alder, chestnut, walnut, and cherry. The three last are used as substitutes for the oak and beech, and these two for the mahogany.\n\nThe following account of the mode of planting that was adopted by the earl of Fife, for no less than 550 acres of moorish lands, is worthy of attention. It is contained in a letter from his lordship to the publisher of the Annals of Agriculture. \"Where there are Earl of Stones in the moor, I inclose with a stone wall five feet high, coped with two turfs, which cost about 15s. tations, every Scots chain of 24 ells, and where there are no stones, which is mostly the case in the moors in the county of Murray, I inclose with a fence of turf, five feet high, four feet wide at the foundation, and 22 inches at top, at 4s. the Scots chain. I find those fences answer as well as the stone, for there are many of them now above 20 years old, as good as at first. I plant in every acre about 1200 trees. I used to plant above 3000, but by experience I find it better not to plant them so thick, but make them up, if necessary, the third year (especially in my plantations in the county of Murray), where scarcely a tree planted ever fails. The greatest number of the trees are Scots firs raised by myself, or purchased at 10d. the thousand, planted from the seed-bed at three years old. I only consider them as nurseries to my other trees, for they are regularly cut out when they have done their duty as nurseries, and are profitable for fire, and useful in agriculture. I plant every other species of forest trees intermixed with the firs. I order different pieces of the moor to be trenched where the soil is best, and most sheltered, and lay a little lime and dung on it, and in these places I sow seeds of trees for nursery. I also plant in beds, year-old trees of different kinds, taken from my other nurseries. I nurse them for three years, and then plant them all over the plantation: this I find very beneficial, as they are raised in the same soil. When I am filling up the plantations, the firs are, for the first time, cut down; or they are transplanted, being raised with balls of earth when the moor is wet with rain, which is very easily done, and they are carried to inclosures of ten or twelve acres, where, from a desire of forward woods, I am planting trees more advanced.\" They are planted in pits about 40 feet distance, and seldom or never fail, and answer a second time as nurseries.\n\n\"My first care after the inclosure is properly filled up, is to guard against injury from cattle: a small allowance given to a few labourers answers that purpose, and if the fences are properly executed they require very little repair. After the plantation is filled up, the most regular attention must be had to the weeding of it, and this is carried on over my plantations of all ages in the most exact manner; I make roads through all the plantations which are carried forward according to the situation, never in a straight line so as to draw violent winds, and those roads go to all parts of the plantation; they make agreeable rides through fine woods, formerly a bleak moor, and answer not only for filling up, but also for carrying away the necessary weedings. As I observed before, the value and prosperity of the wood depends upon the unremitting attention in weeding it.\n\n\"I begin to plant in October, and continue till April. If the weather is frothy and not fit for planting, all the people are employed in weeding the woods.\"\n\nIt is proper, however, upon this subject to remark,\nthat the value of plantations of timber trees, as connected with other branches of agriculture, is not a little limited. In a mountainous country, and in bleak moorish situations, nothing tends more to increase the value of the soil than plantations properly distributed. They give shelter both to the cattle and to the corn crops; and by preventing the warmth which is produced by proper manures, and by the germination of vegetables, from being dissipated, they give effect to all the efforts of industry. Accordingly, in such situations, plantations are no sooner reared, than the whole face of the country around them assumes an improving aspect, and displays a richer verdure. When suddenly cut down, in consequence of the necessities of an imprudent proprietor, the reverse of all this occurs. Vegetation is chilled by the piercing blasts which now meet with no resistance, and the cattle droop from want of shelter; so that in a few years the place can scarcely be known. But the case is very different with regard to a rich and level country that is meant to be cultivated for corn. There the effect of numerous plantations, of high trees and lofty hedge rows, is altogether detrimental to the husbandman. It is only in open fields that grain appears well ripened and completely filled. When surrounded with timber trees, on the contrary, it ripens ill, and is ill coloured and unequal. In spring the high shelter prevents the grounds from drying, and keeps back the labour. In summer the crop is liable to diseases from want of air, and is devoured by large flocks of small birds. In autumn, from want of a free circulation of air the corn ripens late, and in a weeping climate it can never be gathered in good condition. In wet seasons it is utterly ruined. In winter, when the snow is drifting about, the trees prepare a resting place for large quantities of it; these frequently remain and stop the spring work. Add to this, that in a low country even the cattle are hurt by the swarms of vermin that are bred, and come forth, under the shelter of lofty trees and high fences.\n\nPART III. OF THE CATTLE PROPER TO BE EMPLOYED IN FARM WORK; REARING AND MANAGEMENT OF THEM. OF HOGS, POULTRY, &c. OF THE DAIRY. MAKING OF FRUIT LIQUORS. OF FENCES.\n\nSECT. I. Of the Cattle proper to be employed.\n\nA great part of the stock of a husbandman must always consist of cattle, and as one of his principal expenses must consist of the maintenance of them, this part of his business is certainly to be looked upon as extremely important. The cattle belonging to a farm may be divided into two classes, viz. such as are intended for work, and such as are designed for fat. The former are now principally horses, the oxen formerly employed being fallen into disuse, though it does not yet certainly appear that the reasons for the exchange are satisfactory. In the second volume of Bath Papers, we have an account of a comparative experiment of the utility of horses and oxen in husbandry by Mr Keddington near Bury in Suffolk, in which the preference is decisively given to oxen. He informs us, that at the time he began the experiment (in 1779), he was almost certain that there was not an ox worked in the whole county; finding, however, the expense of horses very great, he purchased a single pair of oxen, but found much difficulty in breaking them, as the workmen were so much prejudiced against them, that they would not take the proper pains. At last he met with a labourer who undertook the task; and the oxen soon became as tractable and as handy, both at ploughing and carting, as any horses. On this he determined to part with all his cart-horses; and by the time he wrote his letter, which was in 1781, he had not a single horse, nor any more than five oxen; which inconsiderable number performed with ease all the work of his farm (consisting of upwards of 100 acres of arable land and 60 of pasture and wood), besides the statute duty on the highways, timber and corn carting, harrowing, rolling, and every part of rural business. They are constantly housed; their harness is the same as that of horses (excepting the necessary alterations for difference of size and shape); they are driven with bridles and bits in their mouths, answering to the same words of the ploughman and carter as horses will do. A single man holds the plough, and drives a pair of oxen with reins; and our author informs us, that they will plough an acre of ground in less than eight hours time; he is of opinion that they could do it in seven. The intervals of a small plantation, in which the trees are set in rows ten feet apart, are ploughed by a single ox with a light plough, and he is driven by the man who holds it. The oxen go in a cart either single, or one, two, or three, according to the load. Four oxen will draw 80 bushels of barley or oats in a waggon with ease; and if good of their kind, will travel as fast as horses with the same load. One ox will draw 40 bushels in a light cart, which our author thinks is the best carriage of any. On the whole, he prefers oxen to horses for the following reasons:\n\n1. They are kept at much less expense, never eating more for meal or corn of any kind. In winter they are fed preferring with straw, turnips, carrots, or cabbages; or instead of the three last, they have each a peek of bran per day while kept constantly at work. In the spring they eat hay; and if working harder than usual in feed-time, they have bran besides. When the vetches are fit for mowing, they get them only in the stable. After the day's work in summer they have a small bundle of hay, and stand in the stable till they cool; after which they are turned into the pasture. Our author is of opinion, that an ox may be maintained in condition for the same constant work as a horse, for at least 4l. 1s. annually.\n\n2. After a horse is seven years old, his value declines every year; and when lame, blind, or very old, he is scarce worth anything; but an ox, in any of these situations, may be fattened, and sold for even more than the first purchase; and will always be fat sooner after work than before.\n\n3. Oxen are less liable to diseases than horses.\n\n4. Horses are frequently liable to be spoiled by servants.\nCattle proper to be employed.\n\nMr Kedington concludes his paper with acknowledging, that there is one inconvenience attending the use of oxen, viz. that it is difficult to shoe them; though even this, he thinks, is owing rather to the unskillfulness of the smiths who have not been accustomed to shoe these animals, than to any real difficulty. He confines them in a pound while the operation is performing.\n\nMr Marshall, in his Rural Economy of the Midland Counties, shows the advantage of employing oxen in preference to horses from the mere article of expense, which, according to his calculation, is enormous on the part of the horses. He begins with estimating the number of square miles contained in the kingdom of England; and this he supposes to be 30,000 of cultivated ground. Supposing the work of husbandry to be done by horses only, and each square mile to employ 20 horses, which is about 3 to 100 acres, the whole number used throughout Britain would be 600,000; from which deducting one fifth for the number of oxen employed at present, the number of horses just now employed will be 500,000. Admitting that each horse works ten years, the number of farm-horses which die annually are no fewer than 50,000; each of which requires full four years keep before he is fit for work. Horses indeed are broke in at three, some at two, years old, but they are, or ought to be, indulged in keep and work till they are six; so that the cost of rearing and keeping may be laid at full four ordinary years. For all this consumption of vegetable produce he returns not the community a single article of food, clothing, or commerce; even his skin for economical purposes being barely worth the taking off. By working horses in the affairs of husbandry, therefore, \"the community is losing annually the amount of 200,000 years keep of a growing horse;\" which at the low estimate of five pounds a-year, amounts to a million annually. On the contrary, supposing the business of husbandry to be done solely by cattle, and admitting that oxen may be fattened with the same expenditure of vegetable produce as that which old horses require to fit them for full work, and that instead of 50,000 horses dying, 50,000 oxen, of no more than 52 stone each, are annually slaughtered; it is evident, that a quantity of beef nearly equal to what the city of London consumes would be annually brought into the market; or, in other words, 100,000 additional inhabitants might be supplied with one pound of animal food a-day each; and this without consuming one additional blade of grass. \"I am far from expecting (says Mr Marshall), that cattle will, in a short space of time, become the universal beasts of draught in husbandry; nor will I contend, that under the present circumstances of the island they ought in strict propriety to be used. But I know that cattle, under proper management, and kept to a proper age, are equal to every work of husbandry, in most, if not all situations: And I am certain, that a much greater proportion than there is at present might be worked with considerable advantage, not to the community only, but to the owners and occupiers of lands. If cattle properly employed, one of the 50,000 carcasses now lost annually to the community could be reclaimed, the saving would be an object.\"\n\nIn Norfolk, our author informs us, that horses are the only beasts of labour; and that there is not perhaps one ox worked throughout the whole county. It is the same in the Vale of Gloucester, though oxen are used in the adjoining counties. Formerly some objection was made against the use of oxen; but they were found to them in the Vale of Gloucester up. Even when worked single, the same objection is made: but, says Mr Marshall, \"in this I suspect there is a spice of obstinacy in the old way; a want of a due portion of the spirit of improvement; a kind of indolence. It might not perhaps be too severe to say of the Vale farmers, that they would rather be eaten up by their horses than step out of the beaten track to avoid them.\" Shoeing oxen with whole hooves, in our author's opinion, might remedy the evil complained of; \"but if not, let those (says he) who are advocates for oxen, calculate the comparative difference in wear and keep, and those who are their enemies estimate the comparative mischiefs of treading; and thus decide upon their value as beasts of labour in the Vale.\"\n\nIn the Cotswold oxen are worked as well as horses; but the latter, our author fears, are still in the proportion of two to one: he has the satisfaction to find, however, that the former are coming into more general use. They are worked in harness; the collar and harness being used as for horses, not reversed, as in most cases they are for oxen. \"They appear (says our author) to be perfectly handy; and work, either at plough or cart, in a manner which shows, that although horses may be in some cases convenient, and in most cases pleasurable to the driver, they are by no means necessary to husbandry. A convenience used in this country is a moveable harness with a fledge bottom, harness which is drawn from place to place as occasion may require. Thus no labour is lost either by the oxen or their drivers.\n\nIn Yorkshire oxen are still used, though in much fewer numbers than formerly; but our author does not imagine this to be any decisive argument against their declining utility. The Yorkshire plough was formerly of such an unwieldy construction, that four or five oxen, in yokes, led by two horses, were absolutely requisite to draw it; but the improvements in the construction of the plough have of late been so great, that two horses are found to be sufficient for the purpose; so that Yorkshire has all along been famous for its breed of horses, we are not to wonder at the present dilution of oxen. Even in carriages they are now much diluted; but Mr Marshall affirms as a reason for this, that the roads were formerly deep in winter, and soft to the hoof in summer; but now they are universally a causeway of hard limestone, which hurt the feet of oxen even when shod. Thus it even appears matter of surprise to our author that so many oxen are employed in this county; and the employment of them at all is to him a convincing argument of their utility as beasts of draught. The timber carriers still continue to use them, even though their employment be solely upon the road. They find them not only able to stand working every day, provided their feet do not fail them, but\nCattle pro-\nbut to bear long hours better than horses going in the\nsame pasture. An ox in a good pasture soon fills his\nbelly, and lies down to rest; but a horse can scarce\nsatisfy his hunger in a short summer's night. Oxen are\nsuperiority also considered as much superior at a difficult pull to\nhorses; but this he is willing to suppose arises from\ntheir using half-bred hunters in Yorkshire, and not the\ntrue breed of cart horses. \"But what (says he) are\nthorough-bred cart horses? Why, a species of strong,\nheavy, sluggish animals, adapted solely to the purpose\nof draught; and according to the present law of the\ncountry, cannot, without an annual expense, which\nnobody bestows upon them, be used for any other pur-\npose. This species of beasts of draught cost at four\nyears old from £25l. to £36l. They will, with ex-\ntravagant keep, extraordinary care and attendance,\nand much good luck, continue to labour eight or ten\nyears; and may then generally be sold for five shil-\nlings a-head. If we had no other species of animals\nadapted to the purposes of draught in the island, cart\nhorses would be very valuable, they being much su-\nperior to the breed of fiddle horses for the purpose of\ndraught. But it appears evident, that were only a\nsmall share of the attention paid to the breeding of\ndraught oxen which is now bestowed on the breeding\nof cart horses, animals equally powerful, more active,\nless costly, equally adapted to the purposes of husban-\ndry if harnessed with equal judgment, less expensive in\nkeep and attendance, much more durable, and inﬁ-\nnitely more valuable after they have ﬁnished their la-\nbours, might be produced. A steer, like a colt, ought\nto be familiarized to harness at two or three years old,\nbut should never be subjected to hard labour until he\nbe five years old; from which age until he be 15 or\nperhaps 20, he may be considered as in his prime as a\nbeast of draught. An ox which I worked several years\nin Surrey, might at 17 or 18 years of age have chal-\nlenged for strength, agility, and sagacity, the best bred\ncart horse in the kingdom.\n\nNotwithstanding all that has been said, however,\nand written about the superiority of oxen to horses,\nthe latter are still coming into more general use, espe-\ncially in proportion as the breed of horses improves;\nand we may add, in proportion as the state of cultiva-\ntion in any part of the country improves. The reason\nis obvious. The horse is a more active animal than\nthe ox, and can be turned with greater readiness from\none kind of work to another. His hoof is less readily\ninjured by the hardness of good roads; and for the use\nof the plough upon a well-ordered farm, there is no\ncomparison between the two kinds of animals. Where\nland is once brought into a proper state of tillage, it is\neasily turned over; and the value of the animal em-\nployed in doing so confers not so much in the posses-\nsion of great strength as in the activity which he exerts\nin going over a great extent of ground in a short time.\nIn this last respect, a good breed of horses so far sur-\npasses every kind of oxen yet known in this country,\nthat we suspect much the horse will still continue to be\npreferred by enterprising husbandmen.\n\nWith regard to the loss which the public is suppo-\nsed to sustain by preferring horses to oxen, that point\nhas of late been rendered, to say no more, extremely\ndoubtful. In the Agricultural Survey of the county\nof Northumberland, we have the following compara-\n\nExpence of an Ox per annum.\n\nSummering.—Grafs 2 acres at 20s. per\nacre L. 2 0 0\n\nWintering.—On straw and tur-\nnips L. 2 0 0\nBut if on hay 4 0 0\n\nThe average is 3 0 0\n\nInterest at 5 per cent. for price of the ox L. 5 0 0\nHarnels, hoeing, &c. 0 15 0\n\nDeduct for the increased value of an ox\nfor 1 year 6 5 0\n\nGives the expence per annum of an ox for\nthe team 5 5 0\nAnd the expence of 6 oxen 31 10 0\nTo which must be added the expence of a\ndriver for half a year 3 10 0\n\nTotal expence of a team of 6 oxen L. 35 0 0\n\nAn Eight-Ox team.\n\nThe expence of an ox per annum being L. 5 5 0\n\nThat of eight will be 42 0 0\nTo which add the expence of a driver 8 0 0\n\nGives the expence per annum of an\neight-ox team L. 50 0 0\n\nTherefore the expence of a team of oxen\nfor the first year will be L. 50 0 0\nDitto the second year 35 0 0\nDitto the third year 35 0 0\n\nDivided by 3)120 0 0\nCattle proper to be employed.\n\nBrought over,\n\nDivided by\n\nGives the average expense per annum of an ox team from 3 to 6 years old\n\nExpence of a horse per annum.\n\nSummering.—Gras 2 acres at 20s. per acre\n\nWintering.—Straw 13 weeks at 9d. per week\n\nHay 16 ditto 1½ tons at 2l.\n\nCorn (for a year) 70 bushels of oats at 2l.\n\nShoeing and harness\n\nAnnuity to pay off £5l. in 16 years the purchase value of the horse at four years old\n\nExpence of a horse per annum\n\nExpence of a two-horse team\n\n\"If a three horse-team be used, the account will stand thus:\n\nThe expence of a horse per annum being £15 15 0\n\nThat of three will be\n\nTo which add the expence of a driver\n\nGives the expence of a three-horse team £55 5 0\n\n\"If the comparison be made with the horse team of many of the midland counties, where they use five-borfs yoked one before another in one plough, the account will stand thus:\n\nThe expence of one horse per annum being\n\nThat of five will be\n\nTo which add the expence of a man to drive\n\nThe expence of a team of five horses will be\n\nThe average expence of an ox-team from three to six years old, that will do the same quantity of work as two horses\n\n\"The conclusions to be drawn from the above statement, are so obvious as to need little elucidation. But we cannot help remarking, how strong the force of prejudice must be, to continue the use of five horses, and heavy, clumsy, unwieldy wheel ploughs, where a single saving plough and two horses yoked double, and driven by the holder, would do the same quantity of work, equally well and at one half of the expence.\"\n\n\"But before any proper conclusion can be drawn, whether ox teams or horse are the most eligible, it will be necessary to consider, whether the quantity of land employed in supporting those animals, be used in the most profitable mode to the community, as well as to the occupier.\n\n\"With the latter, the first question for consideration is, whether eight oxen used in the team or in grazing will pay him the most money?\n\n\"Suppose eight oxen, at three years old, were put to the plough, and plough six acres per week, which, at 3s. 4d. per acre, is 20s.; and if they work forty-eight weeks in a year, their whole earnings (after deducting 6l. for expenses of harness, shoeing, &c.) will be 42l.; but if they plough only five acres per week (which is probably nearer the truth), then their whole earnings will be only 34l.\n\n\"The same oxen put to graze at the same money should improve in value 5l. 5s. each in the first case, and 4l. 5s. in the latter; but we are inclined to believe there are few situations, if the cattle are of a good quick-feeding kind, where they would not pay considerably more.\n\n\"In respect to the community, the account will be nearly as follows:\n\n\"From the above statements, we find that an ox for summering and wintering requires 3½ acres Therefore a six-ox team will require 21 ditto And two horses for gras and hay per annum require 7 ditto For corn and straw 4 ditto Land necessary for keeping two horses per annum 11 ditto\n\nThe difference in the quantity of land required for a team of oxen more than horses 10 ditto.\n\n\"Hence it appears, that a team of six oxen requires ten acres more land to maintain them, than a team of two horses, which will do the same work; and of course the produce which might be derived from these ten acres is lost to the community. Suppose it be one half in gras, the other half in tillage, then we shall have\n\n5 Acres of clover or gras,\n1½ Ditto of oats,\n1½ Ditto of turnips or fallow,\n1½ Ditto of wheat.\n\n\"It would then send to market yearly, at the lowest computation,\n\n7½ cwt. of beef,\n8 quarters of oats,\nAnd 5 ditto of wheat.\n\n\"From this view of the subject, it appears that if oxen were universally used for the draught, in the room of horses, there would be a considerable defalcation, in the supply of the markets, both in corn and animal food. And the loss to the farmer would be the profit derived from the produce; which, by the usual mode of allowing one third for the farmer's profit, would in this case be about 10l.\"\n\nSect. II. Of the different kinds of Horses, and the Method of Breeding, Rearing, and Feeding them.\n\nThe midland counties of England have for some time been celebrated on account of their breed of the black cart-horse; though Mr Marshall is of opinion that this kind are unprofitable as beasts of draught in husbandry.\nThe present improvement in the breed took its rise from six Zealand mares sent over by the late Lord Chesterfield during his embassy at the Hague. These mares being lodged at his lordship's seat at Bretby in Derbyshire, the breed of horses thus became improved in that county, and for some time it took the lead for the species of these animals. As the improved breed passed into Leicestershire, however, through some unknown circumstances, it became still more improved, and Leicestershire has for some time taken the lead. It is now found, however, that the very large horses formerly bred in this district are much less useful than such as are of a smaller size. Mr Marshall describes in magnificent terms one of these large horses, a stallion belonging to Mr Bakewell named K (Q), which, he says, was the handsomest horse he ever saw.\n\n\"He was (says he) the fancied war-horse of the German painters; who, in the luxuriance of imagination, never perhaps excelled the natural grandeur of this horse. A man of moderate size seemed to shrink behind his fore end, which rose so perfectly upright, his ears stood (as Mr Bakewell says every horse's ears ought to stand) perpendicularly over his fore feet. It may be said, with little latitude, that in grandeur and symmetry of form, viewed as a picturable object, he exceeded as far the horse which this superior breeder had the honour of showing to His Majesty, and which was afterwards shown publicly at London, as that horse does the meanest of the breed.\" A more useful horse, bred also by Mr Bakewell, however, is described as having \"a thick carcase, his back short and straight, and his legs short and clean; as strong as an ox, yet active as a pony; equally suitable for a cart or a lighter carriage.\"\n\nThe stallions in this county are bred either by farmers or by persons whose business it is to breed them, and who therefore have the name of breeders. These last either cover with themselves, or let them out to others for the season, or sell them altogether to stallion-men who travel about with them to different places.—The prices given for them are from 50 to 200 guineas by purchase; from 40 to 80 or a hundred by the season; or from half a guinea to two guineas by the mare. The mares are mostly kept by the farmers, and are worked until near the times of foaling, and moderately afterwards while they suckle; the best time for foaling is supposed to be the month of March or April; and the time of weaning that of November.—\"The price of foals (says Mr Marshall), for the last ten years, has been from five to ten pounds or guineas; for yearlings, 10 to 15 or 20; for two-year-olds, 15 to 25 or 30; for five year-olds, from 25 to 40 guineas.\"—Our author acknowledges that this breed of horses, considered abstractedly in the light in which they appear here, are evidently a profitable species of live stock, and as far as there is a market for five-years-old horses of this breed, it is profitable to agriculture. \"But (says he) viewing the benefits of agriculture in general, not one occupier in ten can partake of the profit; and being kept in agriculture after they have reached that profitable age, they become indisputably one of its heaviest burdens. For besides a cessation of improvement of four or five guineas a-year, a decline in value of as much yearly takes place. Even the brood-mares, after they have passed that age, may, unless they be of a very superior quality, be deemed unprofitable to the farmer.\"\n\nOur author complains that the ancient breed of Norfolk horfes is almost entirely worn out. They were breed described as small, brown-muzzled, and light boned; but they could endure very heavy work with little food; two of them were found quite equal to the plough in the soil of that county, which is not deep. The present breed is produced by a cross with the large one of Lincolnshire and Leicestershire already mentioned. Suffolk and approves of the Suffolk breed, which (he says) are a Gloucester, \"half-horse half-hog race of animals, but better adapted to the Norfolk husbandry than the Leicestershire breed: their principal fault, in his opinion, is a flatness of the rib.—In the Vale of Gloucester most farmers rear their own plough-horses, breeding of horses not being practised. They are of a very useful kind, the colour mostly black, inclinable to tan colour, short and thick in the barrel, and low on their legs. The price of a five-year-old horse from £5l. to £3l. Some cart-horses are bred in Cotswold hills; the mares are worked till the time of foaling, but not while they suckle; and the foals are weaned early, while there is plenty of grain upon the ground.\n\nYorkshire, which has been long celebrated for its breed of horses, still stands foremost in that respect among the English counties. It is principally remarkable for the breed of saddle-horses, which cannot be reared in Norfolk, though many attempts have been made for that purpose. Yorkshire stallions are frequently sent into Norfolk; but though the foals may be handsome when young, they lose their beauty when old. In Yorkshire, on the other hand, though the foal be ever so unpromising, it acquires beauty, strength, and activity as it grows up. Mr Marshall supposes that from five to ten thousand horses are annually bred up between the eastern Morelands and the Humber.\n\n\"Thirty years ago (says Mr Marshall), strong saddle-horses, fit for the road only, were bred in the Vale; but now the prevailing breed is the fashionable coach-horse, or a tall, strong, and over-sized hunter; and the shows of stallions in 1787 were flat and spiritless in comparison with those of 1783.\" The black cart-horse, an object of Mr Marshall's peculiar aversion, is also coming into the Vale.\n\nIn the breeding of horses he complains greatly of the negligence of the Yorkshire people, the mares being almost totally neglected; though in the brute creation almost everything depends upon the female.\n\nOf late years a very valuable breed of horses has been reared in the upper part of Clydeldale or Lanark-breed of flire. They are of a middle size, well shaped, and extremely active. They are not fit for a very heavy draught, but the very quick step which they possess gives them a decided preference for the use of the plough upon well cultivated lands, as they are capable of going over an immense quantity of ground in a short time.\n\n(Q) Mr Bakewell distinguishes all his horses, bulls, and rams, by the letters of the alphabet.\ntime where the draught is not severe. The same qualities render them highly useful for the ordinary purposes of farm-work. They are rapidly spreading over all parts of the country, and have found their way into the north of England where they are greatly valued. In the same part of the country, a larger breed has also of late been encouraged, which adds very considerable strength or power to the activity of the former kind. They are in great request about Glasgow and other manufacturing towns. Their usual draught is a load of about 24 cwt. in addition to the cart on which the load is placed.\n\nWith regard to the general maintenance of horses, we have already mentioned several kinds of food upon which experiments have been made with a view to determine the most profitable mode of keeping them. Perhaps, however, the most certain method of attaining this matter is by observing the practice of those counties where horses are most in use. Mr Marshall recommends the Norfolk management of horses as the cheapest method of feeding them practised anywhere; which, however, he seems willing to ascribe in a great measure to the excellency of their breed. In the winter months, when little work is to be done, their only rack-meat is barley-straw; a reserve of clover-hay being usually made against the hurry of feed-time. A bushel of corn in the most busy season is computed to be an ample allowance for each horse, and in more leisure times a much less quantity suffices. Oats, and sometimes barley, when the latter is cheap and unfaulable, are given; but in this case the barley is generally malted, i.e., steeped and afterwards spread abroad for a few days, until it begins to vegetate, at which time it is given to the horses, when it is supposed to be less heating than in its natural state. Chaff is universally mixed with horse-corn; the great quantities of corn grown in this county afford in general a sufficiency of natural chaff; so that cut chaff is not much in use: the chaff, or rather the awns of barley, which in some places are thrown as useless to the dunghill, are here in good esteem as provender. Oat-chaff is deservedly considered as being of much inferior quality.—It may be here remarked, that this method of keeping horses which Mr Marshall approves of in the Norfolk farmers, is practised, and probably has been so from time immemorial, in many places of the north of Scotland; and is found abundantly sufficient to enable them to go through the labour required. In summer they are in Norfolk kept out all night, generally in clover leys, and in summer their keep is generally clover only, a few tares excepted.\n\nIn the fourth volume of the Annals of Agriculture, Mr Young gives an account of the expense of keeping horses; which, notwithstanding the vast numbers kept in the island, seems still to be very indeterminate, as the informations he received varied no less from 81 to 25l. a-year. From accounts kept on his own farm of the expense of horses kept for no other purpose than that of agriculture, he stated them as follows:\n\n| Year | Horses | Cost per Horse | Total Cost |\n|------|--------|---------------|------------|\n| 1763 | Six    | 10 13 0       |            |\n| 1764 | Seven  | 8 10 11       |            |\n| 1765 | Eight  | 14 6 6       |            |\n| 1766 | Six    | 12 18 9       |            |\n\nAverage on the whole 11l. 12s. 3d.\n\nVol. I. Part II.\n\nBy accounts received from Northamptons in Herefordshire, the expenses stood as follow:\n\n| Year | Expense per Horse | Total Expense |\n|------|------------------|--------------|\n| 1768 |                  | 20 7 0       |\n| 1769 |                  | 15 8 5       |\n| 1770 |                  | 14 14 2      |\n| 1771 |                  | 15 13 3      |\n| 1772 |                  | 18 4 0       |\n| 1773 |                  | 15 11 8      |\n| 1774 |                  | 14 4 5       |\n| 1775 |                  | 19 0 3       |\n| 1776 |                  | 16 14 5      |\n\nAverage 16l. 13s. 1d.\n\nOn these discordant accounts Mr Young observes, undoubtedly with justice, that many of the extra expenses depend on the extravagance of the servants; while some of the apparent savings depend either on their carelessness, or fleecing provender to their beasts privately, which will frequently be done. He concludes, however, as follows: \"The more exactly the expense of horses is examined into, the more advantageous will the use of oxen be found. Every day's experience convinces me more and more of this. If horses kept for use alone, and not for show, have proved thus expensive to me, what must be the expense to those farmers who make their fat fleck teams an object of vanity? It is easier conceived than calculated.\n\nIt must be observed, however, that the above trials of roots or accounts are of an old date; and that during the late dearth a variety of experiments were made, which shew that horses may be successfully fed, even when engaged in hard labour, with other articles than grain. With this view, different roots have been given them as substitutes; and a great saving has been experienced, attended with no loss of labour or disadvantage to the animal: so that the continuance and extension of this system is a matter of much importance to the public. The articles that have been chiefly employed are turnips, roota baga, potatoes, carrots, &c.—Turnips have been given in a raw state, withholding about one half of the usual allowance of corn, and in most instances the animals have done their work well, and appeared in good condition. When the roota baga has been used, little or no grain has been necessary, and the other roots already mentioned have been successfully used even in a raw state; but when potatoes, yams, roota baga, &c. are boiled, which has sometimes been done, it does not appear that grain is at all necessary. It is to be observed, that young horses eat these roots readily and with great relish; and that during the winter, with them and a small portion of dry food, they are kept in as good condition and spirit as when fed upon grass during the summer. This is a matter of much importance to young animals, as it must contribute greatly to their growth and future strength. Whereas, in a great majority of cases, when reared without the aid of these roots, they are fed in winter, when substantial food is most necessary to support them against the severity of the weather, in such a manner as to be barely kept alive. During the winter months their growth is thus stopt; they lose the little flesh they had acquired during the preceding summer, become flinted and hide-bound, and, when the spring arrives, they are in a miserable state, that a considerable part even of the summer elapses before they can\ncan resume their growth. In this way, four or five years are required to bring them to the size that others of the same species attain in half that time under different management.\n\n**Sect. III. Of the Breeding and Rearing of Black Cattle.**\n\nThese are reared for two different purposes, viz., work, and fattening for slaughter. For the former purpose, Mr Marshall remarks, that it is obviously necessary to procure a breed without horns. This he thinks would be no disadvantage, as horn, though formerly an article of some request, is now of very little value. The horns are quite useless to cattle in their domestic state, though nature has bestowed them upon them as weapons of defence in their wild state; and our author is of opinion that it would be quite practicable to produce a hornless breed of black cattle as well as of sheep, which last has been done by attention and perseverance; and there are now many hornless breeds of these creatures in Britain. Nay, he infers, that there are already three or four breeds of hornless cattle in the island; or that there are many kinds of which numbers of individuals are hornless, and from these, by proper care and attention, a breed might be formed. The first step is to select females; and having observed their imperfections, to endeavour to correct them by a well chosen male.\n\nThe other properties of a perfect breed of black cattle for the purposes of the dairy as well as others, ought, according to Mr Marshall, to be as follow:\n\n1. The head small and clean, to lessen the quantity of offal.\n2. The neck thin and clean, to lighten the fore-end, as well as to lessen the collar, and make it fit close and easy to the animal in work.\n3. The carcase large, the chest deep, and the bottom broad, with the ribs standing out full from the spine; to give strength of frame and constitution, and to admit of the intestines being lodged within the ribs.\n4. The shoulders should be light of bone, and rounded off at the lower point, that the collar may be easy, but broad to give strength; and well covered with flesh for the greater ease of draught, as well as to furnish a desired point in fatting cattle.\n5. The back ought to be wide and level throughout; the quarters long; the thighs thin, and standing narrow at the round bone; the udder large when full, but thin and loose when empty, to hold the greater quantity of milk; with large dug-veins to fill it, and long elastic teats for drawing it off with greater ease.\n6. The legs (below the knee and hock) straight, and of a middle length; their bone, in general, light and clean from deformities, but with the joints and fineness of a moderate size, for the purposes of strength and activity.\n7. The flesh ought to be mellow in the state of fatness, and firm in the state of fatness.\n8. The hide mellow, and of a middle thickness, though in our author's opinion this is a point not yet well determined.\n\nAs the milk of cows is always an article of great importance, it becomes an object to the husbandman, if possible, to prevent the waste of that useful fluid, which in the common way of rearing calves is unavoidable. A method of bringing up these young animals at less expense was at one time proposed by the duke of Northumberland. His plan was to make skimmed milk answer the purpose of that which is newly drawn from the teat; and which, he supposed, might answer the purpose at one-third of the expense of new milk. The articles to be added to the skimmed milk are treacle and the common linseed oil-cake ground very fine, and almost to an impalpable powder, the quantities of each being so small, that to make 32 gallons would cost only 6d. besides the skimmed milk. It mixes very readily and almost intimately with the milk, making it more rich and mucilaginous, without giving it any disagreeable taste. The receipt for making it is as follows: Take one gallon of skimmed milk, and to about a pint of it add half an ounce of treacle, stirring it until it is well mixed; then take one ounce of linseed oil-cake finely pulverized, and with the hand let it fall gradually in very small quantities into the milk, stirring it in the meantime with a spoon or ladle until it be thoroughly incorporated; then let the mixture be put into the other part of the milk, and the whole be made nearly as warm as new milk when it is first taken from the cow, and in that state it is fit for use. The quantity of the oil-cake powder may be increased from time to time as occasion requires, and as the calf becomes insured to its flavour. On this subject Mr Young remarks, that in rearing calves, there are two experiments of great importance. 1. To bring them up without any milk at all; and, 2. To make skimmed milk answer the purpose of such as is newly milked or sucked from the cow. In consequence of premiums offered by the London Society, many attempts have been made to accomplish these desirable purposes; and Mr Budel of Wanborough in Surrey was rewarded for an account of his method. This was no other than to give the creatures a gruel made of ground barley and oats. Mr Young, however, who tried this method with two calves, assures us that both of them died, though he afterwards put them upon milk when they were found not to thrive. When in Ireland he had an opportunity of purchasing calves at three days old from 2s. to 3s. each; by which he was induced to repeat the experiment many times over. This he did in different ways, having collected various receipts. In consequence of these he tried hay-tea, bean-meal mixed with wheat-flour, barley and oats ground nearly, but not exactly, in Mr Budd's method; but the principal one was flax-feed boiled into a jelly, and mixed with warm water; this being recommended more than all the rest. The result of all these trials was, that out of 30 calves only three or four were reared; these few were brought up with barley and oat-meal, and a very small quantity of flax-feed jelly; one only excepted, which, at the desire of his coachman was brought up on a mixture of two-thirds of skimmed milk and one-third of water, with a small addition of flax-jelly well dissolved.\n\nThe second object, viz. that of improving skimmed milk, according to the plan of the duke of Northumberland, seems to be the more practicable of the two. Mr Young informs us, that it has answered well with him for two seasons; and two farmers to whom he communicated it gave likewise a favourable report.\n\nIn the third volume of the same work, we are informed that the Cornwall farmers use the following method in rearing their calves. \"They are taken...\"\nBreeding and Feeding of Black Cattle.\n\nMethod of rearing calves in Cornwall.\n\nMr Crook's method.\n\nIn the 5th volume of Bath Papers, we have an account by Mr Crook of a remarkably successful experiment on rearing calves without any milk at all. This gentleman, in 1787, weaned 17 calves; in 1788, 23; and in 1789, 15. In 1787, he bought three sacks of linseed, value 2l. 5s., which lasted the whole three years. One quart of it was put to fix quarts of water; which, by boiling 10 minutes, was reduced to a jelly; the calves were fed with this mixed with a small quantity of tea, made by steeping the best hay in boiling water. By the use of this food three times a-day, he says that his calves thrived better than those of his neighbours, which were reared with milk. These unnatural kinds of food, however, are in many cases apt to produce a loofenets, which in the end proves fatal to the calves. In Cornwall, they remedy this sometimes by giving acorns as an affriment; sometimes by a cordial used for the human species, of which opium is the basis.\n\nIn Norfolk, the calves are reared with milk and turnips; sometimes with oats and bran mixed among the latter. Winter calves are allowed more milk than summer ones; but they are universally allowed new milk, or even to suck. In the midland counties bull-calves are allowed to remain at the teat until they be six, nine, or twelve months old, letting them run either with their dams or with cows of less value bought on purpose. Each cow is generally allowed one male or two female calves. Thus they grow very fast, and become surprisingly vigorous. The method of the dairy-men is to let the calves suck for a week or a fortnight, according to their strength; next they have new milk in pails for a few meals; after that, new and skimmed milk mixed; then skimmed milk alone, or porridge made with milk, water, ground oats, &c. Sometimes with oil-cake, &c. until cheese-making commences; after which they have whey-porridge, or sweet whey in the field, being carefully houfed in the night until the warm weather come in.\n\nA late intelligent Scottish clergyman, Mr John Bradfute of Dunfyre, once or twice successfully made trial of treacle, as a food by means of which to rear calves without the aid of any kind of milk. He used it diluted with common water, and sometimes with what is called bay-tea, that is to say, water in which hay had been boiled. The whole expense of the treacle necessary to bring a calf the length of using common food was at that time (15 years ago) about 4s. 6d. The animals came forward well, and enjoyed good health; but they grew much to the bone, and did not fatten for a considerable time.\n\nFor feeding cattle, two modes of practice have been proposed, and in some situations adopted; the one mode, which is the most ancient, and the most extensively practised in agricultural countries, consists of turning out the cattle during the whole season that any food for them can be found on the ground, and of taking them into the house during the severity of winter, and of feeding them with such articles as can be most conveniently procured in the climate and situation, such as straw or hay of different kinds, and roots.\n\nThe other mode which has been adopted to some or all extent by husbandmen in Germany, and at times also in our own great towns, by persons called cow-feeders, who supply the inhabitants with milk, is called the system of stall-feeding. It consists of keeping the cattle continually in the house at every season of the year, and of feeding them there. By many German writers upon rural economy this system is highly approved of, as affording the means of drawing the highest possible produce from every portion of the land, and as employing a great number of hands in the useful occupations of husbandry. In a communication to the Board of Agriculture from A. Thaer, M. D., physician of the electoral court of Hanover, the advantages in Germany of this system are said to be founded upon the following incontrovertible principles:\n\n1. A spot of ground which, when pastured upon, will yield sufficient food for only one head, will abundantly maintain four head of cattle in the stable, if the vegetables be mowed at a proper time, and given to the cattle in a proper order.\n\n2. The stall-feeding yields at least double the quantity of manure from the same number of cattle; for the best and most efficacious summer manure is produced in the stable, and carried to the fields at the most proper period of its fermentation, whereas, when spread on the meadow, and exhausted by the air and sun, its power is entirely wasted.\n\n3. The cattle used to stall-feeding will yield a much greater quantity of milk, and increase faster in weight than fattening than when they go to the field.\n\n4. They are less subject to accidents, do not suffer by the heat, by flies, and insects, are not affected by the baneful fogs which are frequent in Germany, and bring on inflammations; on the contrary, if everything be properly managed, they remain in a constant state of health and vigour.\"\n\nIt is added that a sufficient, or rather plentiful supply of food for one feed of cattle daily, if kept in a stable, consists upon an average of 130 pounds of green, or 30 pounds of dry clover, which answers the same purpose. Hence one head of cattle requires in 365 days, about 10,950 pounds of dry clover, or about 100 cwt. of 110 pounds each, the portion of food being according to this mode of feeding alike both in summer and winter. Each head of heavy fat cattle fed in the stable, if plenty of food be given, yields annually 16 full double cart loads of dung. The rotation of crops that is most frequently used in Germany upon farms occupied in stall-feeding, appears to be the following: \"One year, manured for beans, peas, cabbages, potatoes, turnips, linseed, &c.; 2. Rye; 3. Barley, mixed with clover; 4. Clover, to be mowed two or three times; 5. Clover, to be mowed once, then to be broken up, ploughed three or four times, and manured; 6. Wheat; 7. Oats.\"—In consequence of the large quantity of stable dung produced.\nduced upon farms thus occupied, every acre of land receives every three years 10 double cart loads of that best of all kinds of manure.\n\nIt is undoubtedly to be wished that a similar mode of management could be profitably introduced into this country, from the tendency which it would have to augment the number of persons occupied in rural affairs, from the importance which it would give to farms of a moderate extent, and from the benefit which must arise from making the most of every part of the soil. It has already been introduced into several places in England, and we have little doubt that the practice will gradually extend itself, in consequence of the increasing demand for butchers meat, and for all the productions of the dairy.\n\nOf stall-feeding, however, whether with a view to the maintenance or to the fattening of cattle, it must be observed, that there are two modes of proceeding. Of late years it has been found advantageous to cultivate to a great extent turnips, potatoes, and other roots, and these now constitute a large portion of the winter food of cattle. These roots are either given to the cattle in their natural raw state, or they are given after being boiled. Of these two modes of feeding, that of giving them to the cattle raw has hitherto been the most common, but it is extremely improper, as being a thriftless plan of proceeding. The same quantity of these roots, if given in a raw state, that will barely support a horse in idleness, will enable him, when boiled, to encounter the severest labour without injury to his health or spirit. There are many animals also, such as hogs, which cannot be fattened by roots unless they undergo this process. These animals can be reared to the full size upon raw potatoes, yams, carrots, roota baga, &c. and may be kept in good health for any length of time without the aid of any other food. Under that management, however, they very seldom if ever fatten, but when the roots are boiled, they immediately begin to feed, and soon become fat upon a smaller allowance than what was necessary to keep them barely alive when given in a raw state.\n\nThe same holds true in a great degree with regard to all cattle. With a view, therefore, to make the most of the various succulent roots which are now cultivated, and which will perhaps one day be accounted the most valuable productions of our soil, it is absolutely necessary that they should be given to cattle boiled. Many husbandmen have long been sensible of this, but it has appeared a very formidable operation to boil the greatest part of the food of perhaps 20 horses, and 100 head of black cattle. There is nothing more true, however, than that this labour when undertaken upon skilful principles, may be rendered not only easy, but so trifling, that it may be performed by a single old man, or by a woman. To accomplish this object, however, it is necessary, that the roots be boiled not over the fire in a chalderon of metal, but at a distance from it in a large wooden vat or tub by the steam of boiling water.\n\nThere are two ways of boiling roots by steam. They may either be boiled in such a way as to retain their original figure, or they may be converted into soup; both modes are performed with equal ease. All that is necessary, is to erect a boiler in any outhouse: The boiler, which may be of cast iron, ought to have a close cover or lid, having a small hole for filling it with water, which can be easily closed up, and another hole in the centre of about one-fourth of the diameter of the cover. To this last hole ought to be soldered a tube of tin-plate, commonly called white iron, by which the steam may ascend. This tube ought to rise perpendicularly to the height of six feet, narrowing gradually to about two inches diameter. It may then bend off at right angles, to the most convenient situation for the tub or vat in which the roots are to be boiled. When it comes perpendicularly over the centre of the vat, it must be made to descend to within two or three inches of the bottom of it, being properly supported and fixed all the way.\n\nTo boil roots with this apparatus, it is only necessary to tumble them into the tub or vat into which the end of the white iron tube descends. The tub ought then to be covered negligently. The water in the boiler being heated to ebullition, its steam or vapour rises and passes along the white iron tube, and at last descends to the bottom of the wooden vessel containing the roots, and in a very trifling space of time renders them completely soft. If it is wished to convert these roots into soup, it is only necessary to throw among them a quantity of water, and to mash them down with any large ladle or other instrument. The steam continuing to descend will speedily boil the water, and agitate and mingle the whole ingredients of which the soup may be composed. In this way by various mixtures of roots, with little or no trouble, rich broths, which human beings would not dislike, may be formed for feeding a multitude of cattle, and the soup may easily be drawn off from the bottom of the vat by means of a hole to be occasionally opened or shut with a round piece of wood.\n\nIn performing the above operation, however, of forming broth or soup, before allowing the water in the vessel over the fire to give over boiling, the hole ought to be opened by which it is usually filled with water, as the liquor in the vat might otherwise, in consequence of the prelude of the atmosphere, ascend through the white iron tube and come over into the boiler. To strengthen the white iron tube, it may be proper also to cover it all over with paper pasted to it with glue, or with a mixture of pea-meal and water.\n\nTo fatten cattle with succulents, then, we apprehend rules for that the following rules ought to be adhered to. As fattening a man is kept thin and meagre by whatever agitates his mind, or renders him anxious, fretful, and uncomfortable, so we ought to consider that cattle, though they want forethought of the future, have nevertheless minds capable of being irritated and disturbed, which must far worse their bodies. In attempting to fatten them, therefore, care ought to be taken to preserve the tranquillity of their minds, and as much as possible to keep them in a state of cleanliness and of moderate warmth. The food they receive ought to be varied at times to increase their appetite; but above all things it ought to be made as far as possible of easy digestion, that they may receive it in larger portions, and that a greater quantity of it may incorporate with their constitution, and not be thrown off by dung, as happens when they receive coarse nourishment. It is in vain to object to this artificial mode of proceeding, that the natural food of animals is grass alone, and that their natural\nRearing natural dwelling is the open air. The same might be and Fattening Hogs. that is, in his unimproved state, a savage may be under the necessity of eating raw flesh or herbs, or of climbing into a tree for shelter; but although it may be possible for him to subsist in this way, yet we know that this is by no means the best mode of his existence, and that his life and health are better preserved by the shelter of a settled dwelling, and by more delicate food prepared by industry. In the same manner it is no doubt true, that cattle can exist upon very coarse food, and may be even fattened by means of it; but as a great quantity of it becomes necessary, the husbandman's profit in rearing them is so far diminished, and the value of his lands to the community is lessened.\n\nSect. IV. Of the Rearing and Fattening of Hogs.\n\nThe practice of keeping these animals is so general, especially in England, that one should think the profit attending it would be absolutely indisputable; and this the more especially, when it is considered how little nicety they have in their choice of food. From such experiments, however, as have been made, the matter appears to be at least very doubtful, unless in particular circumstances. In the first volume of Annals of Agriculture, we have an experiment by Mr Mure of feeding hogs with the clutter potato and carrots; by which it appeared, that the profit on large hogs was much greater than on small ones; the latter eating almost as much as the former, without yielding a proportionable increase of flesh. The gain was counted by weighing the large and small ones alive; and it was found, that from November 10th to January 5th, they had gained in the following proportion:\n\n| Dr | Cr |\n|----|----|\n| Value of hogs at putting up, L.44 2 o | 42 hogs sold fat at L.95 0 o |\n| 33 coomb pease, at 14s. | 23 2 o |\n| 2 ditto, 2 bushels barley, at 14s. | 1 15 0 |\n| 56 days attendance of one man, at 14d. | 3 5 4 |\n| 950 bushels of carrots, and 598 of potatoes, at 3½d. per bushel | 22 15 8 |\n\nL.95 0 o L.95 0 o\n\nIn some experiments by Mr Young, related in the same volume, he succeeded still worse, not being able to clear his expenses. His first experiment was attended with a loss of one guinea per hog; the second with a loss of 11s. 8d.; the third, of only 3s. In these three the hogs were fed with pease; given whole in the two first, but ground into meal in the last. The fourth experiment, in which the hog was fed with Jerusalem artichokes, was attended with no loss; but another, in which peas were again tried, was attended with a loss of 4s. Other experiments were tried with pease, which turning out likewise unfavourable, barley was tried ground along with pease and beans. This was attended with a small profit, counting nothing for the trouble of feeding the animals. The expenses on two hogs were 14l. 13s. 10½d., the value 15l. 11s. 3½d. so that there was a balance in his favour of 17s. 4½d. In another experiment in which the hogs were fed with pease and barley ground, the beans being omitted as useless, there was a profit of 12s. 3½d. upon an expense of 20l. 15s. 9d.; which our author supposes would pay the attendance. In this experiment the pease and barley meal were mixed into a liquor like cream, and allowed to remain in that state for three weeks, till it became sour. This was attended in two other instances with profit, and in a third with loss; however, Mr Young is of opinion, that the practice will still be found advantageous on account of the quantity of dung raised; and that the farmer can thus use his pease and barley at home without carrying them to market.\n\nIt is to be observed, that the above experiments were not made upon the fattening of hogs in the proper manner in which that animal ought to be fed. Its food ought undoubtedly to consist chiefly of roots, such as yams, potatoes, &c.; but these roots, as already mentioned, ought always to be boiled, or made into soups. With this mode of proceeding, the hog, from its rapid multiplication, and quick growth, is a very profitable kind of stock. It ought to be remembered, however, that of this, as well as of most other kinds of animals, a large breed is always to be preferred; for the difference is very trifling, or rather, in general, amounts to nothing at all, between the quantity of food necessary to support a small animal, and the quantity necessary to support a large animal of the same kind.\n\nHogties are of simple construction; they require only a warm dry place for the swine to lie in, with a small of a proper area before, and troughs to hold their food. They are generally made with shed-roofs, and seldom above 6 or 7 feet wide.\n\nAlthough swine are generally considered as the filthiest of all animals, yet there is no animal delights more in a clean comfortable place to lie down in, and none that cleanliness has a better effect upon with respect to their thriving and feeding. In order to keep them dry, a sufficient slope must be given, not only to the inside where they lie, but to the outside area, with proper drains to carry off all moisture. The inside should also be a little elevated, and have a step up from the area at least 5 or 6 inches. Hogties should have several divisions to keep the different sorts of swine separate, nor should a great many ever be allowed to go together; for it is thought they feed better in small numbers, and of equal size, than when many are put together of different sizes. Proper divisions must therefore be made, some for swine when with the boar, others for brood swine, and for them to farrow in, for weaning the pigs, for feeding, &c.\n\nSwine are apt to spill and waste a great deal of their meat by getting their feet among it, unless proper precautions,\ncautions are taken to prevent them. This may be done by making a rail or covering of thin dale slope from the back part of the trough towards the fore part, leaving just room enough to admit their heads. There should also be divisions across the troughs, according to the number of swine, to prevent the strongest driving away the weakest. These divisions need not extend to the bottom of the troughs, but should rise a little higher than the top, and may be made of pieces of board about 8 or 10 inches broad.\n\nSties ought to be constructed so that the swine may be easily fed without going in among them. In some places it is so contrived that they may be fed through openings in the back kitchen wall, without even going out of doors. This is very convenient where only a few swine are kept for family use, and makes it easy to give them the refuse of vegetables and other things from the kitchen, which, perhaps, would otherwise be thrown away. Where pigs are to be reared on an extensive scale, there ought to be what is called in England a pigs' kitchen, that is, a proper apparatus ought to be erected adjoining to the hogsty, for boiling their food. To avoid expense, steam ought always to be used for this purpose, in the way already described.\n\n**Sect. V. Sheep.**\n\nThe rearing of sheep properly belongs to the article pasturage. So far, however, as they are fed upon the products of human industry, they belong to the present subject. In the Memoirs of the Royal Society of Agriculture in Paris for the year 1788, the result is given of certain experiments upon the advantage and economy of feeding sheep in the house with roots. The experiments were made by M. Crette de Palluel. He states that the custom of feeding sheep in a house is common in several of the French provinces, but in others is unknown: That the mode of fattening them in that situation consisted of giving them clean corn and choice hay: That in substituting roots for corn, hay was continued to be given to them, either of clover, lucern, after-math, or any other sort. The corn commonly used for fattening sheep is barley and oats. Sometimes gray peas, or the marshbed bean, and rye.\n\n\"Although the sheep fed upon roots (says M. Crette) did not acquire quite so great a degree of fatness as those fed upon corn; it is however true, that they all fattened, and that if their food had been varied, they would have made greater progress: I can even assert the fact of four, which were put upon change of food towards the end of the experiment, and ate much more.\n\n\"The sheep put to potatoes ate little at first, for some days, which prevented them from thriving so much as the others; but they recovered the second month what they lost the first. As for those put to turnips and beets, they fed heartily from the first moment, and continued it. They all drank much less than those fed upon corn.\n\n\"Corn might with advantage be added to the roots: When the sheep are intended to be sold, two feeds of corn given them for a fortnight, in the intervals of their meals of roots, would harden both their flesh and their tallow.\n\n\"It was not sufficient to prove the possibility of fattening sheep with different kinds of roots; it was farther necessary to ascertain the qualities which their flesh might acquire, by the use of them. Four sheep, fed upon the four regimens, were killed the same day; there was indeed some trifling difference in the texture of their flesh, but upon the whole the flavour of all was the same. Let us then conclude, that the culture of roots opens to us infinite resources, not only for fattening of sheep, but also of beasts; and we do not doubt of their being used to the greatest advantage in bringing up cattle in the countries where they are bred.\n\n\"The knowledge of these experiments must induce farmers to adopt this culture, since it is so advantageous. Roots cannot be exported; corn, on the contrary, is exported; and the grower may sell the roots instead of confining them. One acre of roots is equal to five acres of corn. By this means he multiplies his land, and may consequently multiply his cattle and his dung-hill: added to this, roots are not subject, like corn, to the inclemencies of the seasons; the produce is always more certain; these plants being of different natures, it is not likely that they should all fail; the earth is a more faithful depository of our treasures than the atmosphere; the dreadful hurricane of the 15th of this month (July) destroyed every thing but roots; they are the only product with escaped its ravages; if the hail tore their leaves, others will soon flourish; and carrots, beets, turnips, and potatoes, will be safe.\"\n\nThe result of the experiments alluded to is given in the following terms:\n\n**Experiment**\n**Experiment upon Fatting Sheep, and their Increase from Month to Month.**\n\nSixteen sheep, of the same age, of four different breeds, were picked out of my flock, viz. four the breed of the country, four of Beauce, four of Champagne, and four of Picardy; I weighed them alive, and marked each with a number; I divided them into four lots, and fed them on four different sorts of food, as under.\n\n| Food          | No. | Breeds                  | Weights

attributed to this cause, that lean cattle put up to fatten, eat greedily until they are cloyed, which only fills them, without much increasing their flesh; but, on the contrary, the increase produced in the ensuing months, although apparently less, turns all to profit in flesh and tallow.”\n\n**Sect. VI. Rabbits.**\n\nIn particular situations these animals may be kept to advantage, as they multiply exceedingly, and require no trouble in bringing up. A considerable number of them are kept in Norfolk, where many parts, consisting of barren hills or heaths, are proper for their reception. They delight in the sides of sandy hills, which are generally unproductive when tilled; but level ground is improper for them. Mr Marshall is of opinion, that there are few sandy or other loofe-foiled hills which would not pay better in rabbit warrens than anything else. “The hide of a bullock (says he) is not worth more than $\\frac{1}{10}$th of his carcase; the skin Rabbits of a sheep may, in full wool, be worth from a sixth to more than a tenth of its carcase; but the fur of a rabbit is liable to be worth twice the whole value of the carcase; therefore black cattle supposing a rabbit to consume a quantity of food in proportion to its carcase, it is, on the principle offered, a species of stock nearly three times as valuable as either cattle or sheep. Rabbit warrens ought to be inclosed with a stone or sod wall; and at their first stocking, it will be necessary to form burrows to them until they have time to make them to themselves. Boring the ground horizontally with a large auger is perhaps the best method that can be practised. Eagles, kites, and other birds of prey, as well as cats, weasels, Method of and pole-cats, are great enemies of rabbits. The Nor-destroying folk warreners catch the birds by traps placed on the birds of tops of stumps of trees or artificial hillocks of a conical form, on which they naturally alight.—Traps also seem to be the only method of getting rid of the other enemies; though thus the rabbits themselves are in danger of being caught.\n\nRabbits may be fed during the summer with clover and...\nand other green food, and during the winter with cabbages. Where they are kept in an inclosure as part of the flock of the farm, a practice which has not yet been used in this country, they ought to be fed with great regularity, and with as much as they are willing to take. When this is done they thrive upon a very moderate quantity of food; but if they are once allowed to suffer hunger in any great degree, they become extremely ravenous, and for a long time can scarcely be satisfied with food. In a communication to the Board of Agriculture from M. Bertrand of Mechlin, in the Netherlands, we are informed that the rabbits of the Angora breed yield in Normandy an uncommonly valuable wool, which serves as a primary material in several considerable manufactures. The Normans assert, that each rabbit yields wool of the value of a crown or five livres. M. Bertrand having discovered that these rabbits are extremely fond of the leaves of the robinia pseudo acacia, (the false acacia), made the following trial of its effects. He fed some females with these leaves only, while to others he gave cabbage leaves and the common food furnished to these animals. He observed that the young ones proceeding from the females fed on the leaves of the robinia, grew larger and in less time, and that their coats and wool were finer than on the others fed in the common way. He caused the skins of the indigenous rabbits fed with the robinia leaves to be examined by haters, and they valued them much more than the common ones, affirming that their wool approached in quality to that of hares. The robinia, he observes, thrives on barren heaths. Its branches and leaves are remarkably numerous. Its leaves may be converted into hay, which rabbits and other animals devour eagerly. One person is able to cut a sufficient quantity of branches for a great number of rabbits; and turnips, vetches, beans, and other vegetables, can be sown under the trees.\n\nSect. VII. Poultry.\n\nPoultry, if rightly managed, might be a source of great profit to the farmer, but where many are kept, they ought not to be allowed to go at large, in which case little profit can be expected from them, for not only will many of their eggs be lost, and many of themselves perhaps destroyed by vermin, but at certain seasons they do a great deal of mischief both in the barn-yard and in the field. No doubt they pick up some grain at the barn doors that might otherwise be lost, but if the straw is properly threshed and shaken, there would be very little of this. In the common careless way of threshing a great deal of corn is undoubtedly thrown out among the straw; but when we consider the dung of the fowls and their feathers that get among it, and the injury these must do to the cattle, this is no object. It is much better to allow the poultry a certain quantity of food, and to let the cattle have the benefit of what corn may remain among the straw.\n\nPoultry ought therefore always to be confined, but not in a close, dark, diminutive hovel, as is often the case; they should have a spacious airy place properly constructed for them. Some people are of opinion that each sort of poultry should be kept by itself, this, however, is not absolutely necessary; for all sorts may be kept promiscuously together, provided they have a place sufficiently large to accommodate them conveniently, and proper divisions and nests for each kind to retire to separately, which they will naturally do of themselves.\n\nThis method is practised with great success at Mr. Wakefield's, near Liverpool, who keeps a large flock of turkeys, geese, hens, and ducks, all in the same place; and although young turkeys are in general considered too difficult to bring up, he rears great numbers of them in this manner every season with little or no trouble whatever. He has about three quarters or near a whole acre inclosed with a fence only six feet high, formed of slabs set on end, or any mode of thinning of fir or other trees split and put close together. They are fastened by a nail near the top and poultry another near the bottom, and are pointed sharp, which I suppose prevents the poultry flying over, for they never attempt it although so low. Within this fence are places done up flightly (but well secured from wet) for each sort of poultry; also a pond or stream of water running through it. These poultry are fed almost entirely with potatoes boiled in steam, and thrive astonishingly well. The quantity of dung that is made in this poultry-place is also an object worth attention; and when it is cleared out, a thin paring of the surface is at the same time taken off, which makes a valuable compost.\n\nIt is generally understood that a full-grown hen continues in her prime for three years, and that during that period, if properly fed, she will lay at a medium rate of two hundred eggs every year. The number, however, of eggs may be greatly increased by making the place to which this kind of poultry retire at night very warm and comfortable by its being placed contiguous to a wall, on the other side of which a fire is kept, or by its being heated in any other manner. In the cottages of the poor in Scotland, where the poultry and the inhabitants sleep under the same roof, the hens continue with a moderate portion of food to produce eggs during the greatest part of the winter.\n\nIn Norfolk a great number of turkeys are bred, of a great number and quality superior to those in other parts. Mr. Marshall accounts for their number in the following manner: \"It is understood in general, that to rear turkeys with success, it is necessary that a male bird should be kept upon the spot to impregnate the eggs singly; but the good housewives of this country know, that a daily intercourse is unnecessary; and that if the hen be sent to a neighbouring cock previous to the season of exclusion, one act of impregnation is sufficient for one brood. Thus relieved from the expense and disagreeableness of keeping a male bird, most little farmers, and many cottagers, rear turkeys. This accounts for their number; and the species and the food they are fattened with (which, I believe, is wholly buck) account for their superior size and quality.\"\n\nThe following account of the Lincolnshire management of geese is given by Mr. John Foote of Brandon, in the Annals of Agriculture. \"It is generally allowed, that three geese to one gander is sufficient; more geese would be too many, so as to render the flake eggs abortive. The quantity of eggs to every goose management for fitting about twelve or thirteen. They must be fed with corn.\"\nPart III.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nManage corn in their water while fitting, near them, so as to keep near them, so that they can see them, as they will naturally watch as a guard over their own geese.\n\nTheir nests should be made for them of straw, and confined so as the eggs cannot roll out when the geese turn them, which they do every day.\n\nWhen near hatching, the shell should be broke a little against the beak or bill of the gosling, to give air, or to enable it to receive strength to throw off the shell at a proper time. The method of plucking them about the beginning of April is this: Pluck gently and carefully the fine feathers off their breast and back; but be careful not to pull or interrupt their down nor pen feathers.\n\nYou also pull their quills, five out of a wing; but I think four would be better. The quills will bear pulling in 13 or 14 weeks again, twice in a year; the feathers three times a year, of the old geese and ganders, seven weeks from the first pulling; and then again seven weeks after, which is the last pulling of the year.\n\nThe young geese may be pulled once at 13 or 14 weeks old, but not quilled, being hatched in March.\n\nIf the geese are late in hatching, I expect the brood geese should not be plucked so soon as April, but the month after.\n\nIf they are fed with barley and oats, as they ought to be, they will thrive and do the better, and their feathers will grow the faster, and be better in quality; they must have plenty of grass and water.\n\nAlthough persons not acquainted with the management of geese, as above described, may think it inhuman; yet I am credibly informed, they will do better than where they do not pluck them, if they are properly done, as they lose their feathers by moulting, and would not be so healthy.\n\nIt is proved, that by annually plucking geese, as in Lincolnshire, there is saved, by the increase of feathers, many hundred pounds value, which other countries waste, though a mistaken opinion, as not an object worth their attention. Goose feathers are now sold at 18s. a stone, that used about 25 years ago to be bought at 10s. or 11s. in that county.\n\nA goose will produce by this method about 1s. 6d. annually of good feathers and quills.\"\n\nSect. VIII. Of the Management of the Dairy.\n\nIn all but the richest corn countries, this is a most important branch of the business of a husbandman. It includes not only the proper method of preserving milk in a wholesome and uncorrupted state, but also the manufacturing from it the two valuable articles of butter and cheese. We shall first consider the subject of the dairy in a general manner; after which, we shall take notice of the mode of preparing butter and cheese.\n\nDr James Anderson remarks, that when a dairy is established, the undertaker may sometimes think his interest to obtain the greatest possible quantity of produce; sometimes it may be more beneficial for him to have it of the finest quality; and at other times it may be necessary to have both these objects in view, the one or the other in a greater or less proportion: it is therefore of importance that he should know how he may accomplish the one or the other of these purposes in the easiest and most direct manner.\n\nTo be able to convert his milk to the highest possible profit in every case, he ought to be fully acquainted with every circumstance respecting the manufacture both of butter and of cheese; as it may in some cases happen, that a certain portion of that milk may be more advantageously converted into butter than into cheese, while another portion of it would return more profit if made into cheese.\n\nThe first thing to be adverted to, in an undertaking of this nature, is to choose cows of a proper sort. Among this class of animals, it is found by experience, that some kinds give milk of a much thicker consistence, and richer quality, than others; nor is this richness of quality necessarily connected with the smallness of the quantity yielded by cows of nearly an equal size; it therefore behoves the owner of a dairy to be peculiarly attentive to this circumstance. In judging of the value of a cow, it ought rather to be the quantity and the quality of the cream produced from the milk of the cow, in a given time, than the quantity of the milk itself: this is a circumstance that will be thrown hereafter to be of more importance than is generally imagined. The small cows of the Alderney breed afford the richest milk hitherto known; but individual cows in every country may be found, by a careful selection, that afford much thicker milk than others; these therefore ought to be searched for with care, and their breed reared with attention, as being peculiarly valuable.\n\nFew persons, who have had any experience at all in the dairy, can be ignorant, however, that in comparing the milk of two cows, to judge of their respective qualities, particular attention must be paid to the time that has elapsed since their calving; for the milk of the same cow is always thinner soon after calving than it is afterwards; as it gradually becomes thicker, though generally less in quantity, in proportion to the time since the cow has calved. The colour of the milk, soon after calving, is richer than it is afterwards; but this, especially for the first two weeks, is a faulty colour, that ought not to be coveted.\n\nTo make the cows give abundance of milk, and of a good quality, they must at all times have plenty of food. Grass is the best food yet known for this purpose, and that kind of grass which springs up spontaneously on rich dry soils is the best of all. If the temperature of the climate be such as to permit the cows to graze at ease throughout the day, they should be suffered to range on such pastures at freedom; but if the cows are too much inclosed by the heat as to be prevented from eating through the day, they ought in that case to be taken into cool shades for protection; where, after allowing them a proper time to ruminate, they should be supplied with abundance of green food, fresh-cut for the purpose, and given to them by hand frequently, in small quantities, fresh and fresh, so as to induce them to eat it with pleasure. When the heat of the day is over, and they can remain abroad with ease, they may be again turned into the pasture, where they should be allowed to range with freedom all night, during the mild weather of summer.\n\nCows, if abundantly fed, should be milked three times a day during the whole of the summer season; in the morning early, at noon, and in the evening, just before night-fall.\nIn the choice of persons for milking the cows, great caution should be employed; for if that operation be not carefully and properly performed, not only the quantity of the produce of the dairy will be greatly diminished, but its quality also will be very much debauched; for if all the milk be not thoroughly drawn from a cow when she is milked, that portion of milk which is left in the udder seems to be gradually absorbed into the system, and nature generates no more than to supply the waste of what has been taken away. If this lessened quantity be not again thoroughly drawn off, it occasions a yet farther diminution of the quantity of milk generated; and thus it may be made to proceed, in perpetual progression from little to less, till none at all is produced. In short, this is the practice in all cases followed, when it is meant to allow a cow's milk to dry up entirely, without doing her hurt. In this manner, therefore, the profits of a dairy might be wonderfully diminished; so that it much behoves the owner of it to be extremely attentive to this circumstance, if he wishes to avoid ruin. It ought to be a rule without an exception, never to allow this important department to be entrusted, without control, to the management of hired servants. Its importance will be still more manifest from the following aphorisms.\n\nAphorism 1. \"Of the milk that is drawn from any cow at one time, that which comes off at the first is always thinner, and of a much worse quality, than that which comes afterwards; and the richness goes on continually increasing to the very last drop that can be drawn from the udder at that time.\"\n\nFew persons are ignorant that the milk which is last of all taken from the cow at milking (in this country called froakings) is richer than the rest of the milk; but fewer still are aware of the greatness of the difference between the quality of the first and the last drawn milk, from the same cow, at one milking. The following facts (says our author) respecting this circumstance were ascertained by me many years ago, and have been confirmed by many subsequent experiments and observations.\n\nHaving taken several large tea-cups, exactly of the same size and shape, one of these tea-cups was filled at the beginning of the milking, and the others at regular intervals, till the last, which was filled with the dregs of the froakings. These cups were then weighed, the weight of each having been settled, so as to ascertain that the quantity of milk in each was precisely the same; and from a great number of experiments, frequently repeated with many different cows, the result was in all cases as follows:\n\nFirstly, The quantity of cream obtained from the first-drawn cup was, in every case, much smaller than from that which was last drawn; and those between afforded less or more as they were nearer the beginning or the end. It is unnecessary here to specify the intermediate proportions; but it is proper the reader should be informed, that the quantity of cream obtained from the last-drawn cup, from some cows, exceeded that from the first in the proportion of fifteen to one. In other cows, however, and in particular circumstances, the difference was not quite so great; but in no case did it fall short of the rate of eight to one. Probably, upon an average of a great many cows, it might be found to run as ten or twelve to one.\n\nSecondly, The difference in the quality of the cream, however, obtained from these two cups, was much greater than the difference in the quantity. In the first cup, the cream was a thin tough film, thinner, and perhaps whiter, than writing paper; in the last, the cream was of a thick butterous consistence, and of a glowing richness of colour that no other kind of cream is ever found to possess.\n\nThirdly, The difference in the quality of the milk that remained, after the cream was separated, was perhaps still greater than either in respect to the quantity or the quality of the cream. The milk in the first cup was a thin bluish liquid, as if a very large proportion of water had been mixed with ordinary milk; that in the last cup was of a thick consistence, and yellow colour, more resembling cream than milk both in taste and appearance.\n\nFrom this important experiment, it appears that the person who, by bad milking of his cows, loses but half a pint of his milk, loses in fact about as much cream as would be afforded by six or eight pints at the beginning, and loses, besides, that part of the cream which alone can give richness and high flavour to his butter.\n\nAphorism 2. \"If milk be put into a dish, and allowed to stand till it throws up cream, that portion of cream which rises first to the surface is richer in quality, and greater in quantity, than what rises in a second equal space of time; and the cream that rises in the second interval of time is greater in quantity, and richer in quality, than that which rises in a third equal space of time; that of the third than the fourth, and so on: the cream that rises decreasing in quantity, and declining in quality, continually, as long as any rises to the surface.\"\n\nOur ingenious author confesses, that his experiments not having been made with so much accuracy in this case as in the former, he was not enabled to ascertain the difference in the proportion that takes place in equal portions of time; but they have been so often repeated as not to leave any room to doubt the fact, and it will be allowed to be a fact of no small importance in the management of the dairy. It is not certain, however, but that a greater quantity of cream may, upon the whole, be obtained from the milk by taking it away at different times: but the process is so troublesome as not to be counterbalanced by the increased quantity obtained, if indeed an increased quantity be thus obtained, which is not as yet quite certain.\n\nAphorism 3. \"Thick milk always throws up a smaller proportion of the cream it actually contains, to the surface, than milk that is thinner; but that cream is of a richer quality. If water be added to that thick milk, it will afford a considerably greater quantity of cream than it would have done if allowed to remain pure, but its quality is, at the same time, greatly debauched.\"\n\nThis is a fact that every person attentive to a dairy must have remarked; but I have never (says our author) heard of any experiment that could ascertain, either the precise amount of the increased quantity of cream that might thus be obtained, or of the ratio in the decrease of its quality. The effects of mixing water with the milk in a dairy are at least ascertained; and the knowledge of the fact will enable attentive persons to follow that practice which they think will best promote their own interest.\n\nAphorism 4. \"Milk which is put into a bucket or other...\"\nother proper vessel, and carried in it to any considerable\nment of the distance, so as to be much agitated, and in part cooled,\nbefore it be put into the milk-pans to settle for cream,\nnever throws up so much, nor so rich cream, as if the\nsame milk had been put into the milk-pans directly\nafter it was milked.\"\n\nIn this case, it is believed the loss of cream will be\nnearly in proportion to the time that has elapsed, and the\nagitation the milk has sustained, after being drawn from\nthe cow. But Dr Anderdon says that he is not yet in\npossession of any experiments which sufficiently ascertain\nhow much is to be ascribed to the time, and the\nagitation, taken separately. On every branch of agricul-\nture we find experiments wanting; at each step we\nadvance in our inquiries; and it is the duty of every in-\nquirer to point out, as he goes along, where they are\nwanted, since the labours of no one man can possibly\ncomplete the whole.\n\nFrom the above facts, the following corollaries seem\nto be clearly deducible:\n\nFirstly, It is of importance that the cows should be\nalways milked as near the dairy as possible, to prevent\nthe necessity of carrying and cooling the milk before it\nis put into the dishes; and as cows are much hurt\nby far driving, it must be a great advantage in a dairy-\nfarm to have the principal grass fields as near the dairy\nor homestead as possible.\n\nSecondly, The practice of putting the milk of all\nthe cows of a large dairy into one vessel, as it is milked,\nthere to remain till the whole milking is finished, before\nany part of it is put into the milk-pans—seems to be\nhighly injudicious; not only on account of the loss that\nis sustained by agitation and cooling, but also, more\nespecially, because it prevents the owner of the dairy\nfrom distinguishing the good from the bad cow's milk\nso as to separate these from each other, where it is ne-\ncessary. He may thus have the whole of his dairy pro-\nduct greatly debased by the milk of one bad cow, for\nyears together, without being able to discover it. A\nbetter practice, therefore, would be, to have the milk\ndrawn from each cow put separately into the creaming-\npans as soon as it is milked, without being ever mixed\nwith any other. Thus would the careful manager of\nthe dairy be able on all occasions to observe the parti-\ncular quality of each individual cow's milk, as well as\nits quantity, and to know with precision which of his\ncows it was his interest to dispose of, and which of them\nhe ought to keep and breed from.\n\nThirdly, If it be intended to make butter of a very\nfine quality, it will be advisable in all cases to keep the\nmilk that is first drawn separate from that which comes\nlast; as it is obvious, that if this be not done, the qua-\nlity of the butter will be greatly debased, without much\naugmenting its quantity. It is also obvious, that if this\nis done, the quality of the butter will be improved in\nproportion to the smallness of the quantity of the last-\ndrawn milk that is retained; so that those who wish to\nbe singularly nice in this respect, will do well to retain\nonly a very small portion of the last drawn milk.\n\nTo those owners of dairies who have profit only in\nview, it must ever be a matter of trial and calculation,\nhow far it is expedient for them to carry the improving\nof the quality of their butter at the expense of di-\nminishing its quantity. In different situations prudence\nwill point out different kinds of practice as most eli-\ngible; and all persons must be left, after making accu-\nrate trials, to determine for themselves. It is likewise\nof the confederation of no small importance, to determine in\nwhat way the inferior milk, that is thus to be set apart\nwhere fine butter is wanted, can be employed with the\ngreatest profit. In the Highlands of Scotland they\nhave adopted, without thinking of the improvement of\ntheir butter, a very simple and economical practice in\nthis respect. As the rearing of calves is there a prin-\ncipal object with the farmer, every cow is allowed to\nfuckle her own calf with a part of her milk, the remain-\nder only being employed in the dairy. To give the\ncalf its portion regularly, it is separated from the cow,\nand kept in an inclosure, with all the other calves be-\nlonging to the same farm. At regular times, the cows\nare driven to the door of the inclosure, where the young\ncalves fail not to meet them. Each calf is then sepa-\nrately let out, and runs directly to its mother, where it\nfucks till the dairy-maid judges it has had enough; she\nthen orders it to be driven away, having previously\nshackled the hinder legs of the mother, by a very sim-\nple contrivance, to oblige her to stand still. Boys drive\naway the calf with switches, and return it to the inclo-\nsure, while the dairy-maid milks off what was left by\nthe calf: thus they proceed till the whole of the cows\nare milked. They obtain only a small quantity of\nmilk, it is true, but that milk is of an exceeding rich\nquality; which, in the hands of such of the inhabitants\nas know how to manage it, is manufactured into the\nrichest marrowy butter that can be anywhere met with.\nThis richness of the Highland butter is universally\nattributed to the old grass the cows feed upon in their\nremote glens; but it is in fact chiefly to be attributed\nto the practice here described, which has long prevailed\nin those regions. Whether a similar practice could be\neconomically adopted elsewhere, our author takes not\nupon him to say; but doubtless other secondary uses\nmight be found for the milk of inferior quality. On\nsome occasions, it might be converted into butter of an\ninferior quality; on other occasions, it might be sold\nsweet, where the situation of the farm was within reach\nof a market-town; and on others, it might be conver-\nted into cheese, which, by being made of sweet milk,\nwould be of a very fine quality if carefully made.\nStill other uses might be devised for its application;\nof which the following is worthy of notice. Take\ncommon skimmed milk, when it has begun to turn sour,\nput it into an upright stand-churn, or a barrel with one\nof its ends out, or any other convenient vessel. Heat\nsome water, and pour it into a tub that is large enough\nto contain with ease the vessel in which the milk was\nput. Set the vessel containing the milk into the hot-\nwater, and let it remain there for the space of one\nnight. In the morning it will be found that the milk\nhas separated into two parts; a thick cream-like sub-\nstance, which occupies the upper part of the vessel, and\na thin watery part, that remains at the bottom. Draw\noff the thin part (called in Scotland wig) by opening\na stop-cock, placed for that purpose close above the\nbottom, and reserve the cream for use. Not much less\nthan half of the milk is thus converted into a sort of\ncream, which, when well made, seems to be as rich and\nfat as real cream itself, and is only distinguishable from\nit by its appearance. It is eaten with sugar, and esteemed\na great delicacy, and usually sells at double the price\nof fresh unskimmed milk. It requires practice, however, to be able to make this nicely; the degree of the heat of the water, and many other circumstances, greatly affecting the operation.\n\nFourthly, If the quality of the butter be the chief object attended to, it will be necessary, not only to separate the first from the last drawn milk, but also to take nothing but the cream that is first separated from the best milk, as it is this first rising cream alone that is of the prime quality. The remainder of the milk, which will be still sweet, may be either employed for the purpose of making sweet-milk cheese, or may be allowed to stand, to throw up cream for making butter of an inferior quality, as circumstances may direct.\n\nFifthly, From the above facts, we are enabled to perceive, that butter of the very best possible quality can only be obtained from a dairy of considerable extent, judiciously managed; for when only a small portion of each cow's milk can be set apart for throwing up cream, and when only a small proportion of that cream can be reserved, of the prime quality, it follows (the quantity of milk being upon the whole very inconsiderable), that the quantity of prime cream produced would be so small as to be scarcely worth manufacturing separately.\n\nSixthly, From these premises we are also led to draw another conclusion, extremely different from the opinion that is commonly entertained on this subject, viz. That it seems probable, that the very best butter could be made with economy in those dairies only where the manufacture of cheese is the principal object. The reasons are obvious: If only a small portion of milk should be set apart for butter, all the rest may be made into cheese, while it is yet warm from the cow, and perfectly sweet; and if only that portion of cream which rises during the first three or four hours after milking is to be reserved for butter, the rich milk which is left after that cream is separated, being still perfectly sweet, may be converted into cheese with as great advantage nearly as the newly-milked milk itself.\n\nBut as it is not probable that many persons could be found who would be willing to purchase the very finest butter, made in the manner above pointed out, at a price that would be sufficient to indemnify the farmer for his trouble in making it, these hints are thrown out merely to show the curious in what way butter possessing this superior degree of excellence may be obtained, if they choose to be at the expense; but for an ordinary market, Dr Anderson is satisfied, from experience and attentive observation, that if in general about the first drawn half of the milk be separated at each milking, and the remainder only set up for producing cream, and if that milk be allowed to stand to throw up the whole of its cream (even till it begins sensibly to taste sourish), and that cream be afterwards carefully managed, the butter thus obtained will be of a quality greatly superior to what can usually be procured at market, and its quality not considerably less than if the whole of the milk had been treated alike. This, therefore, is the practice that he thinks most likely to suit the frugal farmer, as his butter, though of a superior quality, could be afforded at a price that would always ensure it a rapid sale.\n\nOur author now proceeds to enumerate the properties of a dairy. The milk-house ought to be cool in summer and warm in winter; so that an equal temperature may be preserved throughout the year. It ought also to be dry, so as to admit of being kept sweet and clean at all times. A separate building should be erected for the purpose, near a cool spring or running water, where the cows may have easy access to it, and where it is not liable to be immersed by stagnant water. The apartment where the milk stands should be well thatched, have thick walls, and a ventilator in the top for admitting a free circulation of air. There should also be an apartment with a fire-place and caldron, for the purpose of scalding and cleaning the vessels. The Doctor is of opinion, that the temperature of from 50 to 55 degrees is the most proper for separating the cream from the milk, and by proper means this might easily be kept up, or nearly so, both summer and winter.\n\nThe utensils of the dairy should be all made of wooden wood, in preference either to lead, copper, or even utensil preferable iron. These metals are all very easily soluble in every other acids; the solutions of the two first highly poisonous kind, and though the latter is innocent, the taste of it might render the products highly disagreeable.\n\nButter, though used at present as food in most countries of Europe, was not known, or known very imperfectly, to the ancients. This, we think, is completely proved by Professor Beckmann in the second volume of his History of Inventions. In our translation of the Hebrew Scripture, there is indeed frequent mention made of butter at very early periods; but, as the Professor well observes, the greatest masters of biblical criticism unanimously agree, that the word translated signifies milk or cream, or sour milk, and cannot possibly mean what we call butter. The word plainly alludes to something liquid, which was used for washing the feet, which was drunk, and which had sometimes the power of intoxicating; and we know that mare's milk may be so prepared as to produce the same effect. See Koumiss.\n\nThe oldest mention of butter, the Professor thinks, is in the account of the Scythians given by Herodotus (lib. iv. 2.), who says, that \"these people pour the milk of their mares into wooden vessels, cause it to be violently stirred or shaken by their blind flaves, and separate the part which arises to the surface, as they consider it as more valuable and delicious than what is collected below it.\" That this substance must have been a soft kind of butter, is well known; and Hippocrates gives a similar account of Scythian butter, and calls it τιμόνιον, which Galen translates by the word σαλιγκάριον. The poet Anaxandrides, who lived soon after Hippocrates, describing the marriage-feast of Iphicrates, who married the daughter of Cotys king of Thrace, says, that the Thracians ate butter, which the Greeks at that time considered as a wonderful kind of food.\n\nDioctriades says, that good butter was prepared from the fattest milk, such as that of sheep or goats, by shaking it in a vessel till the fat was separated. To this butter he attributes the same effects, when used externally, as those produced by our butter at present. He adds also, and he is the first writer who makes the observation, that fresh butter might be melted and poured over pulse and vegetables instead of oil, and that it might be employed in pastry in the room of other fat substances.\nA kind of foot likewise was at that time prepared from butter for external applications, which was used in curing inflammation of the eyes and other disorders. For this purpose the butter was put into a lamp, and when consumed, the lamp was again filled till the desired quantity of foot was collected in a vessel placed over it.\n\nGalen, who distinguishes and confirms in a more accurate manner the healing virtues of butter, expressly remarks, that cows milk produces the fattest butter; that butter made from sheep's or goats milk is less rich; and that asses milk yields the poorest. He expresses his astonishment, therefore, that Diocorides should say that butter was made only from the milk of sheep and goats. He affirms us that he had seen it made from cows milk, and that he believes it had thence acquired its name. \"Butter (says he) may be very properly employed for ointments; and when leather is besmeared with it, the same purpose is answered as when it is rubbed over with oil. In cold countries, which do not produce oil, butter is used in the baths; and that it is a real fat, may be readily perceived by its catching fire when poured over burning coals.\"\n\nWhat has been here said is sufficient to shew that butter must have been very little known to or used by the Greeks and the Romans in the time of Galen, that is, at the end of the second century.\n\nThe professor having collected, in chronological order, every thing which he could find in the works of the ancients reflecting butter, concludes, that it is not a Grecian, and much less a Roman invention, but that the Greeks were made acquainted with it by the Scythians, the Thracians, and the Phrygians, and the Romans by the people of Germany. He is likewise decidedly of opinion, that when these two polished nations had learned the art of making it, they used it not as food, but only as an ointment, or sometimes as a medicine. \"We never find it (says he) mentioned by Galen and others as a food, though they have spoken of it as applicable to other purposes. No notice is taken of it by Apicius; nor is there any thing said of it in that respect by the authors who treat on agriculture, though they have given us very particular information concerning milk, cheese, and oil.\"\n\nThe ancient Christians of Egypt burnt butter in their lamps instead of oil; and in the Roman churches, it was anciently allowed, during Christmas time, to burn butter instead of oil, on account of the great consumption of it otherwise.\n\nButter is the fat, oily, and inflammable part of the milk. This kind of oil is naturally distributed through all the substance of the milk in very small particles, which are interposed between the caseous and ferrous parts, amongst which it is suspended by a slight adhesion, but without being dissolved. It is in the same state in which oil is in emulsions; hence the same whiteness of milk and emulsions; and hence, by ref, the oily parts separate from both these liquors to the surface, and form a cream. See Emulsion.\n\nWhen butter is in the state of cream, its proper oily parts are not yet sufficiently united together to form a homogeneous mass. They are still half separated by the interpolation of a pretty large quantity of ferrous and caseous particles. The butter is completely formed by pressing out these heterogeneous parts by means of continued percussion. It then becomes an uniform soft mass.\n\nFresh butter, which has undergone no change, has scarcely any smell; its taste is mild and agreeable, it melts with a weak heat, and none of its principles are disengaged by the heat of boiling water. These properties prove, that the oily part of butter is of the nature of the fat, fixed, and mild oils obtained from many vegetable substances by expression. See Oils.—The half fluid consistence of butter, as of most other concrete oily matters, is thought to be owing to a considerable quantity of acid united with the oily part; which acid is so well combined, that it is not perceptible while the butter is fresh, and has undergone no change; but when it grows old, and undergoes some kind of fermentation, then the acid is disengaged more and more; and this is the cause that butter, like oils of the same kind, becomes rancid by age.\n\nButter is constantly used in food, from its agreeable taste; but to be wholesome, it must be very fresh and free from rancidity, and also not fried or burnt; otherwise its acid and even caustic acid, being disengaged, disorders digestion, renders it difficult and painful, excites acid empyreumatic belchings, and introduces much acrimony into the blood. Some persons have stomachs so delicate, that they are even affected with these inconveniences by fresh butter and milk. This observation is also applicable to oil, fat, chocolate, and in general to all oleaginous matters.\n\nDr James Anderson, whom we have already quoted, gives the following minute directions for making and preserving butter. The creaming ditches, when properly cleaned, sweet, and cool, ought to be filled with milk as soon as it is drawn from the cow, having been first carefully strained through a cloth, or close strainer made of hair or wire: the doctor prefers silver wire to every other. The creaming ditches ought never to exceed three inches in depth; but they may be broad as to contain a gallon and a half; when filled they ought to be put on the shelves of the milk-house, and remain there until the cream be fully separated. If the finest butter be intended, the milk ought not to stand above six or eight hours, but for ordinary butter it may stand 12 hours or more; yet if the dairy be very large, a sufficient quantity of cream will be separated in two, three, or four hours, for making the best butter. It is then to be taken off as nicely as possible by a skimming dish, without lifting any of the milk; and immediately after put into a vessel by itself, until a proper quantity for churning be collected. A firm, neat, wooden barrel seems well adapted for this purpose, open at one end, and having a lid fitted to close it. A cock or spigot ought to be fixed near the bottom, to draw off any thin or ferrous part which may drain from the cream; the inside of the opening should be covered with a bit of fine silver wire gauze, in order to keep back the cream while the serum is allowed to pass; and the barrel should be inclined a little on its stand, to allow the whole to run off.\n\nThe doctor contradicts the opinion that very fine cream butter cannot be obtained, except from cream that is ought not to above a day old. On the contrary, he insists that it is only in very few cases that even tolerably good butter can be obtained from cream that is not above one day old. The separation of butter from cream-butter.\nonly takes place after the cream has attained a certain degree of acidity. If it be agitated before that acidity has begun to take place, no butter can be obtained, and the agitation must be continued till the time that the curds are produced; after which the butter begins to form. \"In summer, while the climate is warm, the heating may be, without very much difficulty, continued until the acidity be produced, so that butter may be got: but in this case the process is long and tedious; and the butter is for the most part of a soft consistence, and tough and gluey to the touch. If this process be attempted during the cold weather in winter, butter can scarcely be in any way obtained, unless by the application of some great degree of heat, which sometimes assists in producing a very inferior kind of butter, white, hard, and brittle, and almost unfit for any culinary purpose whatever. The judicious farmer, therefore, will not attempt to imitate this practice, but will allow his cream to remain in the vessel appropriated for keeping it, until it has acquired the proper degree of acidity. There is no rule for determining how long it is to be kept; but our author is of opinion, that a very great latitude is allowable in this case; and that if no ferrous matter be allowed to lodge among the cream, it may be kept good for making butter a great many weeks.\n\nThe churn in which butter is made likewise admits of considerable diversity; but our author prefers the old-fashioned upright churn to all others, on account of its being more easily cleaned. The labour, when the cream is properly prepared, he thinks, very trifling. Much greater nicety, he says, is required in the process of churning than most people are aware of; as a few hasty and irregular strokes will render butter bad, which otherwise would have been of the finest quality. After the process is over, the whole ought to be separated from the milk, and put into a clean dish, the inside of which, if made of wood, ought to be well rubbed with common salt, to prevent the butter from adhering to it. The butter should be pressed and worked with a flat wooden ladle or skimming dish, having a short handle, so as to force out all the milk that was lodged in the cavities of the mass. This operation requires a considerable degree of strength as well as dexterity; but our author condemns the beating up of the butter with the hand as \"an indelicate and barbarous practice.\" In like manner he condemns the employment of cold water in this operation, to wash the butter as it is called. Thus, he says, the quality of it is debased in an astonishing degree. If it is too soft, it may be put into small vessels, and these allowed to swim in a tub of cold water; but the water ought never to touch the butter. The beating should be continued till the milk be thoroughly separated, but not till the butter become tough and gluey; and after this is completely done, it is next to be salted. The vessel into which it is to be put must be well seasoned with boiling water several times poured into it: the inside is to be rubbed over with common salt, and a little melted butter poured into the cavity between the bottom and sides, so as to make it even with the bottom; and it is then fit for receiving the butter. Instead of common salt alone, the doctor recommends the following composition. \"Take of sugar one part, of nitre one part, and of the best Spanish great salt two parts. Beat the whole into a fine powder, mix them well together, and put them by for use. One ounce of this is to be mixed with a pound of butter as soon as it is freed from the milk, and then immediately put into the vessel designed to hold it; after which it must be pressed so close as to leave no air-holes; the surface is to be smoothed and covered with a piece of linen, and over that a piece of wet parchment; or, in defect of this last, fine linen that has been dipped in melted butter, exactly fitted to the edges of the vessel all round, in order to exclude the air as much as possible. When quite full, the cask is to be covered in like manner, and a little melted butter put round the edges, in order to fill up effectually every cranny, and totally to exclude the air. \"If all this (says the doctor) be carefully done, the butter may be kept perfectly sound in this climate for many years. How many years I cannot tell; but I have seen it two years old, and in every respect as sweet and sound as when only a month old. It deserves to be remarked, that butter cured in this manner does not taste well till it has stood at least a fortnight after being salted; but after that period is elapsed, it eats with a rich marrowy taste that no other butter ever acquires; and it tastes to little fault, that a person who had been accustomed to eat butter cured with common salt only, would not imagine it had got one-fourth part of the salt necessary to preserve it.\"\n\nOur author is of opinion, that strong brine may be useful to pour upon the surface during the time it is using, in order the more effectually to preserve it from the air, and to avoid rancidity.\n\nAs butter contains a quantity of mucilaginous matter much more putrefiable than the pure oily part, our author recommends the purifying it from this mucilage by melting in a conical vessel, in which the mucilage will fall to the bottom; the pure oily part swimming at top. This will be useful when butter is to be sent a long voyage to warm climates, as the pure part will keep much better than when mixed with the other. He proposes another method of preserving butter, viz. by mixing it with honey, which is very antiseptic, and mixes intimately with the butter. Thus mixed, it eats very pleasantly, and may perhaps be successfully used with a medicinal intention.\n\nIn England no butter is esteemed equal to that which Epping butter is made in the county of Essex, well known by the name of Epping butter, and which in every season of the year yields at London a much higher price than any other. The following directions concerning the making and management of butter, including the Epping method, are extracted from the 3d volume of the Bath Society Papers.\n\nIn general it is to be observed, that the greater the quantity made from a few cows, the greater will be the farmer's profit; therefore he should never keep any but what are esteemed good milkers. A bad cow will be equally expensive in her keep, and will not perhaps (by the butter and cheese that is made from her) bring in more than from three to five pounds a-year; whereas a good one will bring from seven to ten pounds per annum: therefore it is obvious that bad cows should be parted with, and good ones purchased in their room. When such are obtained, a good servant should be employed to milk them; as through the neglect and mismanagement of servants, it frequently happens that\nthe best cows are spoiled. No farmer should trust entirely to servants, but sometimes see themselves that their cows are milked clean; for if any milk is suffered to remain in the udder, the cow will daily give less, till at length she will become dry before the proper time, and the next season she will scarce give milk sufficient to pay for her keep.\n\nIt sometimes happens that some of a cow's teats may be scratched or wounded so as to produce foul or corrupted milk; when this is the case, we should by no means mix it with the sweet milk, but give it to the pigs; and that which is conveyed to the dairy-house should remain in the pail till it is nearly cool, before it be strained, that is, if the weather be warm; but in frosty weather it should be immediately strained, and a small quantity of boiling water may be mixed with it, which will cause it to produce cream in abundance, and the more so if the pans or vats have a large surface.\n\nDuring the hot summer months, it is right to rise with or before the sun, that the cream may be skimmed from the milk ere the dairy becomes warm; nor should the milk at that season stand longer in the vats, &c., than 24 hours; nor be skimmed in the evening till after sunset. In winter milk may remain unskimmed for 36 or 48 hours; the cream should be deposited in a deep pan, which should be kept during the summer in the coolest part of the dairy; or in a cool cellar where a free air is admitted, which is still better. Where people have not an opportunity of churning every other day, they should shift the cream daily into clean pans, which will keep it cool, but they should never fail to churn at least twice in the week in hot weather; and this work should be done in a morning before the sun appears, taking care to fix the churn where there is a free draught of air. If a pump-churn be to be used, it may be plunged a foot deep into a tub of cold water, and should remain there during the whole time of churning, which will very much harden the butter. A strong rancid flavour will be given to butter, if we churn too near the fire as to heat the wood in the winter season.\n\nAfter the butter is churned, it should be immediately washed in many different waters till it is perfectly cleansed from the milk; but here it must be remarked, that a warm hand will soften it, and make it appear greasy, so that it will be impossible to obtain the best price for it. The cheesemongers use two pieces of wood for their butter; and if those who have a very hot hand were to have such, they might work the butter so as to make it more saleable.\n\nThe Epping butter is made up for market in long rolls, weighing a pound each; in the county of Somerset, they dish it in half pounds for sale; but if they forget to rub salt round the inside of the dish, it will be difficult to work it so as to make it appear handsome.\n\nButter will require and endure more working in winter than in summer; but it is remarked, that no person whose hand is warm by nature makes good butter.\n\nThose who use a pump-churn must endeavour to keep a regular stroke; nor should they admit any person to assist them, except they keep nearly the same stroke: for if they churn more slowly, the butter will in the winter go back, as it is called; and if the stroke be more quick and violent in the summer, it will cause a fermentation, by which means the butter will imbibe a very disagreeable flavour.\n\nWhere people keep many cows, a barrel-churn is to be preferred; but if this be not kept very clean, the bad effects will be discovered in the butter; nor must we forget to shift the situation of the churn when we use it, as the seasons alter, so as to fix it in a warm place in winter, and where there is a free air in summer.\n\nIn many parts of this kingdom they colour their butter in winter, but this adds nothing to its goodness; and it rarely happens that the farmers in or near Epping use any colour; but when they do, it is very innocent. They procure some sound carrots, whose juice they express through a sieve, and mix with the cream when it enters the churn, which makes it appear like May butter; nor do they at any time use much fat, though a little is absolutely necessary.\n\nAs they make in that country but very little cheese, so of course very little whey butter is made; nor indeed should any person make it, except for present use, as it will not keep good more than two days; and the whey will turn to better account to fatten pigs with. Nothing feeds these faster, nor will anything make them so delicately white. At the same time it is to be observed, that no good bacon can be made from pigs thus fattened; where much butter is made, good cheese for servants may be obtained from skimmed milk, and the whey will afterwards do for store pigs.\n\nThe foregoing rules will suffice for making good West of England butter in any country; but as some people are partial to the west country method, it shall be described as briefly as possible.\n\nIn the first place, they deposit their milk in earthen pans in their dairy-house, and (after they have stood twelve hours in the summer, and double that space in the winter) they remove them to floes made for that purpose, which floes are filled with hot embers; on these they remain till bubbles rise, and the cream changes its colour; it is then deemed heated enough, and this they call scalded cream; it is afterwards removed steadily to the dairy, where it remains 12 hours more, and is then skimmed from the milk and put into a tub or churn: if it be put into a tub, it is beat well with the hand, and thus they obtain butter; but a cleaner way is to make use of a churn. Some scald it over the fire, but then the smoke is apt to affect it; and in either case, if the pans touch the fire, they will crack or fly, and the milk and cream will be wasted.\n\nThe Cambridgeshire salt butter is held in the highest esteem, and is made nearly after the same method as Bridgford's Epping; and by washing and working the salt butter, from it the cheesemongers in London often sell it at a high price for fresh butter. They deposit it when made into wooden tubs or firkins, which they expose to the air for two or three weeks, and often wash them; but a readier way is to season them with unslaked lime, or a large quantity of salt and water well boiled will do: with this they must be scrubbed several times, and afterwards thrown into cold water, where they should remain three or four days, or till they are wanted; then they should be scrubbed as before, and well rinsed with cold water; but before they receive the butter, care.\ncare must be taken to rub every part of the firkin with salt; then if the butter be properly made, and perfectly sweet, it may be gently pressed into the firkin; but it must be well salted when it is made up, and the salt should be equally distributed through the whole mass, and a good handful of salt must be spread on the top of the firkin before it is heated, after which the head should be immediately put on.\n\nThey pursue nearly the same method in Suffolk and Yorkshire; nor is the butter that is made in these counties much inferior to that made in Cambridgeshire; indeed it is often sold in London for Cambridge butter: and no people make more butter from their cows than the Yorkshire farmers do, which is certainly owing to the care they take of their cows in the winter; as at that season they house them all, feed them with good hay, and never suffer them to go out (except to water) but when the weather is very serene; and when their cows calve, they give them comfortable malt messes for two or three days after; but these cows' never answer if they are removed to other counties, except the same care and attendance be given them, and then none answer better.\n\nLand whereon cows feed does very often affect the butter. If wild garlic, charlock, or May-weed, be found in a pasture ground, cows should not feed there-in till after they have been mown, when such pernicious plants will appear no more till the following spring; but those cows that give milk must not partake of the hay made therefrom, as that will also diffuse its bad qualities.\n\nGreat part of the Epping butter is made from cows that feed during the summer months in Epping forest, where the leaves and shrubby plants contribute greatly to the flavour of the butter. The mountains of Wales, the highlands of Scotland, and the moors, commons, and heaths in England, produce excellent butter where it is properly managed; and though not equal in quantity, yet far superior in quality to that which is produced from the richest meadows; and the land is often blamed when the butter is bad through mismanagement, sluttishness, or indolence.\n\nTurnips and rape affect milk and butter, but brewers grains are sweet and wholesome food, and will make cows give abundance of milk; yet the cream thereon will be thin, except good hay be given at the same time, after every meal of grains. Coleworts and cabbages are also excellent foods; and if these and favours were cultivated for this purpose, the farmers in general would find their account in it.\n\nCows should never be suffered to drink improper water; stagnated pools, water wherein frogs, &c., spawn, common sewers, and ponds that receive the drainings of stables, are improper.\n\nDivers abuses are committed in the packing and salting of butter, to increase its bulk and weight, against which we have a statute express. Pots are frequently laid with good butter for a little depth at the top, and with bad at the bottom; sometimes the butter is set in rolls, only touching at top, and standing hollow at bottom. To prevent these cheats, the factors at Uxeter keep a surveyor, who, in case of suspicion, tries the pots with an iron instrument called a butter-bore, made like a cheese-taster, to be stuck in obliquely to the bottom.\n\nIn the Annals of Agriculture, vol. xvii., the following mode of preventing butter and cream from receiving a taint from the cows feeding on cabbages and turnips is stated by J. Jones Esq. of Bolas-heath, Newport, Shropshire. \"I find by experience (says he) that a small how bit of saltpetre, powdered and put into the milk-pan, may be with the new milk, does effectually prevent the cream and butter from being tainted, although the cows be fed on the refuse leaves of cabbages and turnips. In and turnips the beginning of this last winter, my men were very careful in not giving to the cows any outside or decayed leaves of the cabbages or turnips; yet the cream and butter were sadly tainted: but as soon as the maid used the saltpetre, all the taint was done away; and afterwards no care was taken in feeding the cows, for they had cabbages and turnips in all places. Our milk-pans hold about nine pints of milk.\"\n\nThe trade in butter is very considerable. Some compute 50,000 tons annually consumed in London. It is chiefly made within 40 miles round the city. Fifty thousand firkins are said to be sent yearly from Cambridge and Suffolk alone; each firkin containing 56 lbs. Uxeter in Staffordshire is a market famous for good butter, inasmuch that the London merchants have established a factory there for that article. It is bought by the pot, of a long cylindrical form, weighing 14lb.\n\nThe other grand object of the dairy is cheese-making. Cheese is the curd of milk, precipitated or coagulated, separated from the whey by an acid. Cheese differs in quality according as it is made from new or skimmed milk, from the curd which separates spontaneously upon standing, or that which is more speedily produced by the addition of rennet. Cream also affords a kind of cheese, but quite fat and butteraceous, and which does not keep long. Analyzed chemically, cheese appears to partake much more of an animal nature than butter, or the milk from which it was made. It is insoluble in every liquid except spirit of nitre, and caustic alkaline ley. Shaved thin, and properly treated with hot water, it forms a very strong cement if mixed with quicklime*. When prepared with the hot water, it is recommended in the Swedish memoirs to be used by anglers as a bait. It may be made into any form, is not softened by the cold water, and the fishes are fond of it. As a food, physicians condemn the too free use of cheese. When new, it is extremely difficult of digestion; when old, it becomes acid and hot; and, from Dr Percival's experiments, is evidently of a febrile nature. It is a common opinion that old cheese digests everything, yet is left undigested itself; but this is without any solid foundation. Cheese made from the milk of sheep digests sooner than that from the milk of cows, but is less nourishing; that from the milk of goats digests sooner than either, but is also the least nourishing. In general, it is a kind of food fit only for the laborious, or those whose organs of digestion are strong.\n\nEvery country has places noted for this commodity: thus Cheddar and Gloucester cheese are famous in England; and the Parmesan cheese is in no less repute abroad, especially in France. This sort of cheese is entirely made of sweet cow-milk: but at Rochefort in Languedoc, they make it of ewe's milk; and in other places it is usual to add goat or ewe's milk in a certain proportion to that of the cow. There is likewise a kind\nkind of medicated cheese made by intimately mixing the expressed juice of certain herbs, as sage, balm, mint, &c., with the curd before it is fashioned into a cheese. The Laplanders make a sort of cheese of the milk of their rein-deer; which is not only of great service to them as food, but on many other occasions. It is a very common thing in these climates to have a limb numbed and frozen with the cold: their remedy for this is the heating an iron red hot, and thrusting it through the middle of one of these cheeses; they catch what drops out, and with this anoint the limb, which soon recovers. They are subject also to coughs and diseases of the lungs, and these they cure by the same sort of medicine: they boil a large quantity of the cheese in the fresh deer's milk, and drink the decoction in large draughts warm several times a day. They make a less strong decoction of the same kind also, which they use as their common drink, for three or four days together, at several times of the year. They do this to prevent the mischief they are liable to from their water, which is otherwise their constant drink, and is not good.\n\nIn making cheese the same precaution is to be observed as with regard to butter, viz. the milk ought not to be agitated by carrying to any distance; nor ought the cows to be violently driven before they are milked, which reduces the milk almost to the same state as if agitated in a barrel or churn. To this cause Mr Twamley, who has written a treatise upon dairy management, attributes the great difficulty sometimes met with in making the milk coagulate; four or five hours being sometimes necessary instead of one (the usual time employed); and even after all, the curd will be of such a soft nature, that the cheese will swell, puff up, and rent in innumerable places, without ever coming to that solid consistence which it ought to have. As this frequently happens in consequence of heat, Mr Twamley advises to mix a little cold spring water with the milk. It is a bad practice to put in more runnet when the curd appears difficult to be formed, for this, after having once formed the curd by the use of a certain quantity, will dissolve it again by the addition of more.\n\nThe most common defects of cheese are its appearing when cut full of small holes called eyes; its pulling up, cracking, and purring out quantities of thin ferous liquor; becoming afterwards rotten and full of maggots in those places from which the liquor issued. All this, according to our author, proceeds from the formation of a substance called by him lip curd, a kind of half coagulum, incapable of a thorough union with the true curd, and which when broken into very small bits produces eyes; but if in larger pieces, occasions those rents and cracks in the cheese already mentioned; for though this kind of curd retains its coagulated nature for some time, it always sooner or later dissolves into a ferous liquid. This kind of curd may be produced,\n\n1. By using the milk too hot.\n2. By bad runnet.\n3. By not allowing the curd a proper time to form.\n\nThe first of these is remedied by the use of cold water, which our author says is so far from being detrimental to the quality of the cheese, that it really promotes the action of the runnet upon the milk. The second, viz. a knowledge of good from bad runnet, can only be acquired by long practice, and no particular directions can be given, farther than that the utmost care must be taken that it have no putrid tendency, nor merit of any rancidity from too great heat in drying. The only rule that can be given for its preparation is to take out the maw of a calf which has fed entirely upon Of prepa-\n\nmilk; after it is cold, swill it a little in water; rub it run-\n\nwell with salt; then fill it with the same, and afterwards cover it. Some cut them open and spread them in salt, putting them in layers above one another, let-\n\nting them continue in the brine they produce, some-\n\ntimes stirring or turning them for four, six, or nine months; after which they are opened to dry, stretched out upon sticks or splints. They may be used immediately after being dried, though it is reckoned best to keep them till they be a year old before they are used. The best method of making the runnet from the skins, according to our author, is the following:\n\n\"Take pure spring water, in quantity proportioned to the runnet you intend to make; it is thought best by some two skins to a gallon of water; boil the wa-\n\nter, which makes it softer or more pure; make it with salt into brine that will swim an egg: then let it stand till the heat is gone off to about the heat of blood-warm; then put your maw-skin in, either cut in pieces or whole; the former I should imagine best or most convenient; letting it steep 24 hours, after which it will be fit for use. Such quantity as is judged necessary must then be put into the milk; about a tea-cupful being necessary for ten cows milk; though in this respect very particular directions cannot be given.\"\n\nIn the Bath Papers, Mr Hazard gives the follow-\n\ning receipt for making runnet. \"When the maw-skin is well prepared and fit for the purpose, three pints or runnet, two quarts of soft water, clean and sweet, should be mixed with salt, wherein should be put sweet brier, rose leaves and flowers, cinnamon, cloves, mace, and in short almost every sort of spice and aromatic that can be procured; and if these are put into two quarts of water, they must boil gently till the liquor is reduced to three pints, and care should be taken that this liquid is not smoked; it should be strained clear from the spices, &c., and when found not to be warmer than milk from the cow, it should be poured upon the vell or maw; a lemon may then be sliced into it, when it may remain a day or two; after which it should be strained again and put into a bottle, where, if well corked, it will keep good for twelve months or more; it will smell like a perfume, and a small quantity of it will turn the milk, and give the cheese a pleasing flavour.\" He adds, that if the vell or maw be salted and dried for a week or two near the fire, it will do for the purpose again almost as well as before.\n\nIn the making of cheese, supposing the runnet to be of a good quality, the following particulars must be ob-\n\nserved:\n\n1. The proper degree of heat. This ought to be what is called milk-warm, or, \"a few degrees removed from coolness,\" according to Mr Twamley; considerably below the heat of milk taken from the cow. If too hot, it may be reduced to a proper temperature by cold water, as already mentioned.\n\n2. The time allowed for the runnet to take effect. This, our author observes, ought never to be less than an hour and a half. The process may be accelerated, particularly by putting salt to the milk before\nfore the runnet is added. Mr Twamley advises two handfuls to ten or twelve cows milk; but he affirms us, that no bad consequence can follow from the curd being formed ever so soon; as it then only becomes more solid and fit for making cheese of a proper quality. 3. To prevent any difficulty in separating the curd from the whey, prepare a long cheese-knife from lath; one edge being sharpened to cut the curd across from top to bottom in the tub, crofting it with lines checkerwise: by which means the whey rises through the vacancies made by the knife, and the curd sinks with much more ease. A sieve has also been used with success, in order to separate the whey perfectly from the curd. 4. Having got the curd all firm at the bottom of the tub, take the whey from it; let it stand a quarter of an hour to drain before you put it into the vat to break it. If any bits of slip-curd swim among the whey, pour it all off together rather than put it among the cheese, for the reasons already given. Some dairy-women allow the curd to stand for two hours; by which time it is become of so firm a nature that no breaking is necessary: they have only to cut it in slices, put it into the vat, and work it well by squeezing thoroughly to make it fit close; then put it into the press. Our author, however, approves more of the method of breaking the curd, as less apt to make the cheese hard and horny. 5. When the whey is of a white colour, it is a certain sign that the curd has not subsided; but if the method just now laid down be followed, the whey will always be of a green colour; indeed this colour of the whey is always a certain criterion of the curd having been properly managed. 6. The best method of preventing cheese from heaving, is to avoid making the runnet too strong, to take care that it be clean, and not tainted; to be certain that the curd is fully come, and not to stir it before the air has had time to escape; a quantity of air being always discharged in this as in many other chemical processes. 7. Cheese is very apt to split in consequence of being \"salted within,\" especially when the vat is about half filled. In this case the curd, though separated only in a small degree by the salt, never closes or joins as it ought to do. Mr Twamley prefers salting in the milk greatly to this method. 8. Dry cracks in cheese are generally produced by keeping curd from one meal to another, and letting the first become too stiff and hard before it is mixed with the other. 9. Curdy or wrinkle-coated cheese is caused by four milk. Cheese made of cold milk is apt to be hard, or to break and fly before the knife. 10. Such coated cheese is caused by being made too cold, as cheese that is made in winter or late in autumn is apt to be, unless laid in a warm room after it is made.\n\nCheese is of very different quality, according to the milk from which it is made: Thus, in Gloucestershire, what is called the second or two-meal cheese, is made from one meal of new milk and one of skimmed or old milk, having the cream taken away. Skimmed cheese or flit-milk cheese, is made entirely from skimmed milk, the cream having been taken off to make butter. It goes by the name of Suffolk cheese, and is much used at sea; being less liable to be affected by the heat of warm climates than the other kinds. A great deal of difference, however, is to be observed in the quality of it, which our author supposes to arise chiefly from greater care being taken in some places than in others.\n\nSlip-coat or soft cheese is made entirely of slip-curd, and dissolves into a kind of creamy liquor; which is a demonstration of the nature of this curd, as already mentioned. It is commonly computed, that as much milk is required to make one pound of butter as two of cheese; and even more where the land is poor, and the pastures afford but little cream.\n\nBest methods of making cheese in England. The Double Gloucester is a cheese that pleases almost every Gloucester palate. The best of this kind is made from new, or (as it is called in that and the adjoining counties) covered milk. An inferior sort is made from what is called half-covered milk; though when any of these cheeses turn out to be good, people are deceived, and often purchase them for the best covered milk cheese: but farmers who are honest have them stamped with a piece of wood made in the shape of a heart, so that any person may know them.\n\nIt will be every farmer's interest (if he has a sufficient number of cows) to make a large cheese from one meal's milk. This, when brought in warm, will be easily changed or turned with the runnet; but if the morning or night's milk be to be mixed with that which is fresh from the cow, it will be a longer time before it turns, nor will it change sometimes without being heated over the fire, by which it often gets dust or foot, or smoke; which will give the cheese a very disagreeable flavour.\n\nWhen the milk is turned, the whey should be carefully strained from the curd. The curd should be broken small with the hands; and when it is equally broken, it must be put by a little at a time into the vat, carefully breaking it as it is put in. The vat should be filled an inch or more above the brim, that when the whey is pressed out, it may not shrink below the brim; if it does, the cheese will be worth very little. But first, before the curd is put in, a cheese cloth or strainer should be laid at the bottom of the vat: and this should be so large, that when the vat is filled with the curd, the ends of the cloth may turn again over the top of it. When this is done, it should be taken to the press, and there remain for the space of two hours, when it should be turned and have a clean cloth put under it and turned over as before. It must then be pressed again, and remain in the press six or eight hours; when it should again be turned and rubbed on each side with salt. After this it must be pressed again for the space of 12 or 14 hours more; when, if any of the edges project, they should be pared off: it may then be put on a dry board, where it should be regularly turned every day. It is a good way to have three or four holes bored round the lower part of the vat, that the whey may drain so perfectly from the cheese as not the least particle of it may remain.\n\nThe prevailing opinion of the people of Gloucestershire and the neighbouring counties is, that the cheeses will spoil if they do not scrape and wash them when they are found to be mouldy. But others think that suffering the mould to remain mellows them, provided they are turned every day. Those, however, who will have the mould off, should cause it to be removed with a clean dry flannel, as the washing the cheeses is\nManage-ment of the species of fungus rooted in the coat) grow again immediately.\n\nSome people scald the curd; but this is a bad and mercenary practice; it robs the cheese of its fatness, and can only be done with a view to raise a greater quantity of whey butter, or to bring the cheeses forward for sale, by making them appear older than they really are.\n\nAs most people like to purchase high coloured cheese, it may be right to mix a little arnotto with the milk before it is turned. No cheese will look yellow without it; and though it does not in the least add to the goodness, it is perfectly innocent in its nature and effects.\n\nCheddar cheese is held in high esteem; but its goodness is said to be chiefly owing to the land whereon the cows feed, as the method of making it is the same as is pursued throughout Somersetshire, and the adjoining counties.\n\nCheeshire cheese is much admired; yet no people take less pains with the runnet than the Cheeshire farmers. But their cheeses are so large as often to exceed one hundred pounds weight each; to this (and the age they are kept, the richness of the land, and the keeping such a number of cows as to make such a cheese without adding a second meal's milk) their excellence may be attributed. Indeed they salt the curd (which may make a difference), and keep the cheeses in a damp place after they are made, and are very careful to turn them daily.\n\nThe following account of the mode of making this cheese is stated in the Annals of Agriculture, by Mr John Chamberlain of Chester. \"The process of making Cheshire cheese is as follows, viz. on a farm capable of keeping 25 cows, a cheese of about sixty pounds weight may be daily made, in the months of May, June, and July.\n\n\"The evening's milk is kept untouched until next morning, when the cream is taken off, and put to warm in a brass pan heated with boiling water; then one-third part of that milk is heated in the same manner, so as to bring it to the heat of new milk from the cows; (This part of the business is done by a person who does not assist in milking the cows during that time.) Let the cows be milked early in the morning; then the morning's new milk and the night's milk, thus prepared, are put into a large tub together with the cream; then a portion of runnet that has been put into water milk-warm the evening before is put into the tub, sufficient to coagulate the milk; and at the same time, if arnotto be used to colour the cheese, a small quantity, as requisite for colouring, (or a marigold or carrot infusion) is rubbed very fine, and mixed with the milk, by stirring all together; then covering it up warm, it is to stand about half an hour, or until coagulated; at which time it is first turned over with a bowl, to separate the whey from the curds, and broken soon after with the hand and bowl into very small particles; the whey being separated by standing some time, is taken from the curd, which sinks to the bottom; the curd is then collected into a part of the tub which has a lip or loose board across the diameter of the bottom of it, for the sole use of separating them; and a board is placed thereon, with weights, from sixty to a hundred and twenty pounds, to press out the whey: when it is getting into a more solid consistence, it is cut, and turned over in slices several times, to extract all the whey, and then weighted as before; which operations may take up about an hour and a half. It is then taken from the tub, as near the side as possible, and broken very small by hand, and salted, and put into a cheese vat, enlarged in depth by a tin hoop to hold the quantity, it being more than bulk when finally put into the press. Then press the side well by hand, and with a board at top well weighted; and placing wooden skewers round the cheese to the centre, and drawing them out frequently, the upper part of the cheese will be drained of its whey: then shift it out of the vat; first put a cloth upon the top of it, and reverve it on the cloth into another vat, or the same, which vat should be well scalded before the cheese is returned into it; then the top part is broken by hand down to the middle, and salt mixed with it, and skewered as before, then pressed by hand, weighted, and all the whey extracted. This done, reverve the cheese again into another vat, warmed as before, with a cloth under it; then a tin hoop or binder is put round the upper edge of the cheese and within the sides of the vat, the cheese being first inclosed in a cloth, and the edges of it put within the vat.\n\n\"N.B. The cloth is of fine hemp, one yard and a half long by one yard wide. It is so laid, that on one side of the vat it shall be level with the side of it, on the other it shall lap over the whole of the cheese, and the edges put within the vat; and the tin fillet to go over the whole. All the above operations will take from seven in the morning till one at noon. Finally, it is put into a press of fifteen or twenty cwt. and stuck round the vat into the cheese with thin wire skewers, which are shifted occasionally. In four hours more, it should be shifted and turned, and in four hours more, the same, and the skewering continued. Next morning, let it be turned by the woman who attends the milk, and put under another or the same press, and so turned at night and the next morning; at noon, taken out finally to the salting room, there salt the outside, and put a cloth binder round it. The cheese should, after such salting, be turned twice a day for six or seven days, then left two or three weeks to dry, turned and cleaned every day, taken to the common cheese room, laid on straw on a boarded floor, and daily turned until grown hard.\n\n\"The room should be moderately warm; but no wind or draught of air should be permitted, which generally cracks them. Some rub the outsides with butter or oil to give them a coat.\n\n\"The spring-made cheese is often shipped for the London market in the following autumn, and it is supposed to be much ameliorated by the heating on board the vessel.\"\n\nBut of all the cheese this kingdom produces, none is Stilton more highly esteemed than the Stilton, which is called cheese the Parmesan of England, and (except faulty) is never sold for less than 1s. or 1s. 2d. per pound.\n\nThe Stilton cheeses are usually made in square vats, and weigh from five to twelve pounds each cheese. Immediately after they are made, it is necessary to put them into square boxes made exactly to fit them; they being so extremely rich, that except this precaution\nbe taken they are apt to bulge out, and break afunder. They should be continually and daily turned in these boxes, and must be kept two years before they are properly mellowed for sale.\n\nSome make them in a net somewhat like a cabbage net; so that they appear, when made, not unlike an acorn. But these are never so good as the other, having a thicker coat, and wanting all that rich flavour and mellowness which make them so pleasing.\n\nIt is proper to mention that the making of these cheeses is not confined to the Stilton farmers, as many others in Huntingdonshire (not forgetting Rutland and Northamptonshire) make a similar sort, sell them for the same price, and give all of them the name of Stilton cheese.\n\nThough these farmers are remarked for cleanliness, they take very little pains with the runnet, as they in general only cut pieces from the well or maw, which they put into the milk, and move gently about with the hand, by which means it breaks or turns it so, that they easily obtain the curd. But if the method above described for making runnet were put in practice, they would make their cheese still better; at least they would not have so many faulty and unfound cheeses; for notwithstanding their cheeses bear such a name and price, they often find them so bad as not to be saleable; which is probably owing to their being so careless about the runnet.\n\nIt has been alleged, that as good cheese might be made in other counties, if people would adhere to the Stilton plan, which is this: They make a cheese every morning; and to this meal of new milk they add the cream taken from that which was milked the night before. This, and the age of their cheeses, have been supposed the only reasons why they are preferred to others; for from the nicest observation, it does not appear that their land is in any respect superior to that of other counties.\n\nExcellent cream cheeses are made in Lincolnshire, by adding the cream of one meal’s milk to milk which comes immediately from the cow; these are pressed gently two or three times, turned for a few days, and are then disposed of at the rate of 1s. per pound, to be eaten while new with radishes, salad, &c.\n\nMany people give skimmed milk to pigs, but the whey will do equally well after cheeses are made from this milk; such cheeses will always sell for at least 2d. per pound, which will amount to a large sum annually where they make much butter. The peasants and many of the farmers in the north of England never eat any better cheese; and though they appear harder, experience hath proved them to be much easier of digestion than any new milk cheeses. A good market may always be found for the sale of them at Bristol.\n\nAccount of the making of Parmesan cheese; by Mr Zappa of Milan: in answer to queries from Arthur Young, Esq.\n\n“Are the cows regularly fed in stables?”—From the middle of April, or sooner if possible, the cows are sent to pasture in the meadows till the end of November usually.\n\n“Or only fed in stables in winter?”—When the season is past, and snow comes, they are put into stables for the whole winter, and fed with hay.\n\n“Do they remain in the pasture from morning till night? or only in hot weather?”—Between nine and ten in the morning the cows are sent to water, and then to the pastures, where they remain four or five hours at most, and at three or four o’clock are driven to the stables if the season is fresh, or under porticoes if hot; where for the night, a convenient quantity of hay is given them.\n\n“In what months are they kept at pasture the whole day?”—Mostly answered already; but it might be said, that no owner will leave his cattle, without great cause, in uncovered places at night. It happens only to the shepherds from the Alps, when they pass, because it is impossible to find stables for all their cattle.\n\n“What is the opinion in the Lodefan, on the best conduct for profit in the management of meadows?”\n\n—for a dairy farm of 100 cows, which yields daily a cheese weighing 70 or 75 lb. of 28 ounces, are wanted 1000 perticas of land. Of these about 800 are standing meadows, the other 200 are in cultivation for corn and grass fields in rotation.\n\n“Do they milk the cows morning and evening?”\n\n—Those that are in milk are milked morning and evening, with exception of such as are near calving.\n\n“One hundred cows being wanted to make a Lodefan each day, it is supposed that it is made with the milk of the evening and the following morning; or of the morning and evening of the same day: how is it?”\n\n—the 100 cows form a dairy farm of a good large cheese; it is reckoned that 80 are in milk, and 20 with calves sucking, or near calving. They reckon one with the other about 32 boccalis of 32 oz. of milk. Such is the quantity for a cheese of about 70lb. of 28 ounces. They join the evening with the morning milk, because it is fresher than if it was that of the morning and evening of the same day. The next morning milk would be 24 hours old when the next morning the cheese should be made.\n\n“Do they skim or not the milk to make butter before they make the cheese?”\n\n—from the evening milk, all the cream possible is taken away for butter, macarponi (cream cheese), &c. The milk of the morning ought to be skimmed lightly; but every one skims as much cream as he can. The butter is sold on the spot immediately at 24 sous: the cheese at about 28 sous. The butter loses nothing in weight; the cheese loses one-third of it, is subject to heat, and requires expenses of service, attention, warehouses, &c., before it is sold; and a man in two hours makes 45 or 50lb. of butter that is sold directly. However, it is not possible to leave much cream in the milk to make Lodefan cheese, called grained cheese; because if it is too rich, it does not last long, and it is necessary to consume it while young and found.\n\n“Is Parmesan or Lodefan cheese made every day in the year or not?”\n\n—with 100 cows it is. In winter, however, the milk being less in quantity, the cheese is of lesser weight, but certainly more delicate.\n\n“After gathering or uniting the milk, either skimmed or not, what is exactly the whole operation?”\n\n—the morning of the 3rd of March 1786, I have seen the whole operation, having gone on purpose to the spot to see the whole work from beginning to end. At 10 Italian hours, or ten in the morning, according to the...\nPart III.\n\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nManaging the northern way to account hours, the skimming of that morning's milk, gathered only two hours before, was finished. I did, meanwhile, examine the boiler or pot. At the top it was eight feet (English) diameter, or thereabout; and about five feet three inches deep, made like a bell, and narrowing towards the bottom to about two and one-half feet. They joined the cream produced that morning with the other produced by the milk of the evening before. That produced by this last milk was double in quantity to that of the morning milk, because it had the whole night to unite, and that of the morning had only two hours to do it: in which it could not separate much. Of the cream, some was destined to make macarponies (cream cheese), and they put the rest into the machine for making butter. Out of the milk of the evening before and of that morning, that was all put together after skimming, they took and put into the boiler 272 boceali, and they put under it two faggots of wood; which being burnt, were sufficient to give the milk a warmth a little superior to lukewarm. Then the boiler being withdrawn from the fire, the foreman put into it the runnet, which they prepare in small balls of one ounce each, turning the ball in his hand always kept in the milk entirely covered; and after it was perfectly dissolved, he covered the boiler to keep the milk defended, that it might not suffer from the coldness of the season, particularly as it was a windy day. I went then to look on the man that was making macarponies, &c., and then we went twice to examine if the milk was sufficiently coagulated. At the 18 hours, according to the Italian clocks, or noon, the true manufacture of cheese began. The milk was coagulated in a manner to be taken from the boiler in pieces from the surface. The foreman, with a stick that had 18 points, or rather nine small pieces of wood fixed by their middle in the end of it, and forming nine points on each side, began to break exactly all the coagulated milk, and did continue to do so for more than half an hour, from time to time examining it to see its state. He ordered to renew the fire, and four faggots of willow branches were used all at once; he turned the boiler that the fire might act; and then the underman began to work in the milk with a stick, like the above, but only with four smaller sticks at the top, forming eight points, four at each side, a span long each point. In a quarter of an hour the foreman mixed in the boiler the proper quantity of saffron, and the milk was all in knobs, and finer grained than before, by the effect of turning and breaking the coagulation, or curd, continually. Every moment the fire was renewed or fed; but with a faggot only at a time, to continue it regular. The milk was never heated much, nor does it hinder to keep the hand in it to know the fineness of the grain, which refines continually by the stick-work of the underman. It is of the greatest consequence to mind when the grain begins to take a coarseness. When it comes to this state, the boiler is turned from the fire, and the underman immediately takes out the whey, putting it into proper receivers. In that manner the grain subsides to the bottom of the boiler; and leaving only in it whey enough to keep the grain covered a little, the foreman extending himself as much as he can over and in the boiler, unites with his hands the grained milk, making like a body of paste of it. Then a large piece of linen is run by him under that paste, while another man keeps the four corners of it, and the whey is directly put again into the boiler, by which is facilitated the means of raising that paste that is taken out of the boiler, and put for one quarter of an hour into the receiver where the whey was put before, in the same linen it was taken from the boiler; which boiler is turned again directly on the fire, to extract the malcarpa (whey cheese); and is a second product, eaten by poor people. After the paste remained for a quarter of an hour in that receiver, it was taken out and turned into the wooden form called saffera, without any thing else made than the rotundity, having neither top nor bottom. Immediately after having turned it into that round wooden form, they put a piece of wood like a cheese on it, putting and increasing gradually weights on it, which serve to force out the remnant of the whey; and in the evening the cheese so formed is carried into the warehouse, where, after 24 hours, they begin to give the salt. It remains in that warehouse for 15 or 20 days; but in summer only from 8 to 12 days. Meanwhile the air and salt form the crust to it; and then it is carried into another warehouse for a different service. In the second warehouse they turn every day all the cheeses that are not older than six months; and afterwards it is enough if they are only turned every 48 or 60 hours, keeping them clean, in particular, of that bloom which is inevitable to them, and which, if neglected, turns musty, and causes the cheese to acquire a bad smell. The Lodian, because it is a province watered, has a great deal of meadows, and abounds with cows, its product being mostly in cheese, butter, &c. However, the province of Pavia makes a great deal of that cheese; and we Milanese do likewise the same from the side of Porte Tofa, Romana, Ticinese, and Vercellino, because we have fine meadows and dairy farms.\n\nSect. IX. Making of Fruit-Liquors.\n\nThese, as objects of British husbandry, are principally two, Cyder and Perry; the manufacturing of which forms a capital branch in our fruit-counties, and of which the improvement must be considered as of great importance to the public, but particularly to the inhabitants of those districts where these liquors constitute their common beverage.\n\nCyder and perry, when genuine and in high perfection, are excellent vinous liquors, and are certainly far more wholesome than many others which are present in much higher estimation. When the must is prepared from the choicest fruit, and undergoes the exact degree of vinous fermentation requisite to its perfection, the acid and the sweet are so admirably blended with the aqueous, oily, and spirituous principles, and the whole so imbued with the grateful flavour of the rinds, and the agreeable aromatic bitter of the kernels, that it assumes a new character; grows lively, sparkling, and exhilarating; and when completely mellowed by time, the liquor becomes at once highly delicious to the palate, and congenial to the constitution; superior in every respect to most other English wines, and perhaps not inferior to many of the best foreign wines. Such (says Dr Fothergill*) pers, vol. v.\nwould it be pronounced by all competent judges, were it not for the popular prejudice annexed to it as a cheap home-brewed liquor, and consequently within the reach of the vulgar. To compare such a liquor with the foreign fiery sophisticated mixtures often imported under the name of wines, would be to degrade it; for it certainly surpasses them in flavour and pleasantness, as much as it excels them in wholesome and cheapness. But rarely do we meet with perry or cyder of this superior quality. For what is generally sold by dealers and inn-keepers is a poor, meagre, vapid liquor, prone to the acetous fermentation, and of course very injurious to the constitution. Is it not very mortifying, after the experience of so many centuries, that the art of preparing those ancient British liquors should still be so imperfectly understood as to seem to be in its very infancy?—That throughout the principal cyder districts, the practice should still rest on the most vague indeterminate principles, and that the excellence of the liquor should depend rather on a lucky random hit, than on good management? Yet such appears to be really the case even among the most experienced cyder-makers of Herefordshire and Gloucestershire.\n\nMr Marshall, that nice observer of rural affairs, in his tour through those counties (expressly undertaken for the purpose of inquiry on this subject), informs us, that scarcely two of these professional artists are agreed as to the management of some of the most essential parts of the process: That palpable errors are committed as to the time and manner of gathering the fruit—in laying it up—in neglecting to separate the unfound—and to grind properly the rinds and kernels, &c.: That the method of conducting the vinous fermentation, the most critical part of the operation, and which stamps the future value of the liquor, is by no means ascertained; while some promote the fermentation in a spacious open vat, others repulse it by inclosing the liquor in a hoghead, or strive to prevent it altogether: That no determinate point of temperature is regarded, and that the use of the thermometer is unknown or neglected: That they are as little confident as to the time of racking off; and whether this ought to be done only once, or five or six times repeated: That for fining down the liquor, many have recourse to that odious article, bullocks blood, when the intention might be much better answered by whites of eggs or infusions. And, finally, that the capricious taste of particular customers is generally consulted, rather than the real excellence of the liquor; and consequently that a very imperfect liquor is often vended, which tends to reduce the price, to disgrace the vender, and to bring the use of cyder and perry into disrepute.\n\nThe art of making vinous liquors is a curious chemical process; and its success chiefly depends on a dexterous management of the vinous fermentation, besides a close attention to sundry minute circumstances, the theory of which is perhaps not yet fully understood by the ablest chemists. Can we longer wonder then that so many errors should be committed by illiterate cyder-makers, totally unversed in the first principles of the chemical art? Some few, indeed, more enlightened than their brethren, and less bigotted to their own opinions, by dint of observation strike out improvements, and produce every now and then a liquor of superior quality, though perhaps far short of excellence, yet still sufficient to show what might possibly be accomplished by a series of new experiments conducted on philosophical principles. This might lead means of successive improvements, till at length our English fruit-liquors might be carried to a pitch of perfection hitherto unknown, by which the demand, both at home and abroad, would soon be enlarged, the prices augmented according to the quality, the value of estates increased, and the health and prosperity of these counties proportionally advanced. This might also help to point out a method of correcting the imperfections of these liquors; and of meliorating those of a weak meagre quality, by safer and more effectual means than are now practised: and though nothing can fully compensate the defect of sunshine in maturing the saccharine juices in unfavourable seasons, yet probably such liquors might, without the dangerous and expensive method of boiling in a copper vessel, admit of considerable improvement by the addition of barm or other suitable ferment, as yet unknown in the practice of the cyder districts; or perhaps rather by a portion of rich must, or some wholesome sweet, as honey, sugar-candy, or even molasses, added in due proportion, previous to the fermentation. In fact, it appears from a late publication* that the Germans are known to meliorate their thin harsh wines by an addition of concentrated must, not by evaporation, but by freezing. By this simple process they are made to emulate good French wines: a practice worthy of imitation, especially in the northern climates.\n\nCyder, as is well known, is made from apples, and perry, from pears only. The general method of preparing both these liquors is very much the same; and under the article Cyder a description will be given of the way in which those fruits are gathered, ground, and pressed. The mill is not essentially different from that of a common tanner's mill for grinding bark. It consists of a millstone from two and a half to four feet and a half in diameter, running on its edge in a circular stone trough, mill-house, from nine to twelve inches in thickness, and from one to two tons in weight. The bottom of the trough in which this stone runs is somewhat wider than the thickness of the stone itself; the inner side of the groove rises perpendicularly, but the outer spreads in such a manner as to make the top of the trough fix or eight inches wider than the bottom; by which means there is room for the stone to run freely, and likewise for putting in the fruit, and stirring it up while grinding. The bed of a middle-sized mill is about 9 feet, some 10, and some 12; the whole being composed of two, three, or four stones cramped together and finished after being cramped in this manner. The best stones are found in the forest of Dean; generally a dark, reddish gritstone, not calcareous; for if it were of a calcareous quality, the acid juice of the fruits would act upon it and spoil the liquor: a clean-grained grindstone grit is the fittest for the purpose. The runner is moved by means of an axle passing through the centre, with a long arm reaching without the bed of the mill, for a horse to draw by; on the other side is a shorter arm passing through the centre of the stone, as represented.\nMaking of Fruit-Liquors.\n\nAn iron bolt, with a large head, passes through an eye, in the lower part of the swivel on which the stone turns, into the end of the inner arm of the axis; and thus the double motion of it is obtained, and the stone kept perfectly upright. There ought also to be fixed on the inner arm of the axis, about a foot from the runner, a cogged wheel working in a circle of cogs, fixed upon the bed of the mill. The use of these is to prevent the runner from sliding, which it is apt to do when the mill is full; it likewise makes the work more easy for the horse. These wheels ought to be made with great exactness. Mr Marshall observes, that it is an error to make the horse draw by traces: \"The acting point of draught (says he), the horse's shoulder, ought for various reasons, to be applied immediately at the end of the arm of the axis; not two or three yards before it; perhaps of a small mill near one fourth of its circumference.\"\n\nThe building in which the mill is enclosed ought to be of such a size, that the horse may have a path of three feet wide betwixt the mill and the walls; so that a middling-sized mill, with its horse-path, takes up a space of 14 or 15 feet every way. The whole dimensions of the mill-house, according to our author, to render it any way convenient, are 24 feet by 20; it ought to have a floor thrown over it at the height of seven feet; with a door in the middle of the front, and a window opposite, with the mill on one side and the press on the other side of the window. The latter must be as near the mill as convenience will allow, for the more easy conveying the ground fruit from the one to the other. The press, which is of a very simple construction, has its bed or bottom about five feet square. This ought to be made entirely either of wood or stone; the practice of covering it with lead being now universally known to be pernicious. It has a channel cut a few inches within its outer edge, to catch the liquor as it is expressed, and convey it to a lip formed by a projection on that side of the bed opposite to the mill; having under it a stone trough or wooden vessel, sunk within the ground, when the bed is fixed low, to receive it. The press is worked with levers of different lengths; first a short, and then a moderately long one, both worked by hand; and lastly, a bar eight or nine feet long worked by a capstan or windlass. The expense of fitting up a mill-house is not very great. Mr Marshall computes it from 20l. to 25l. and, on a small scale, from 10l. to 15l. though much depends on the distance and carriage of the stone; when once fitted up it will last many years.\n\nThe making of the fruit-liquors under consideration requires an attention to the following particulars. I. The fruit. II. The grinding. III. Pressing. IV. Fermenting. V. Correcting. VI. Laying up. VII. Bottling; each of which heads is subdivided into several others.\n\nI. In the management of the fruit, the following particulars are to be considered.\n\n1. The time of gathering; which varies according to the nature of the fruit. The early pears are fit for the mill in September; but few apples are ready for gathering before Michaelmas; though, by reason of accidental circumstances, they are frequently manufactured before that time. For sale cider, and keeping drink, they are suffered to hang upon the trees till fully ripe; and the middle of October is generally looked upon to be a proper time for gathering the flire-apple. The criterion of a due degree of ripeness is the fruit falling from the tree; and to force it away before that time, in Mr Marshall's opinion, is robbing it of some of its most valuable particles. \"The harvesting of fruit (says he) is widely different in this respect from the harvesting of grain; which has the entire plant to feed it after its separation from the soil; while fruit, after it is severed from the tree, is cut off from all possibility of a further supply of nourishment; and although it may have reached its wonted size, some of its more essential particles are undoubtedly left behind in the tree.\" Sometimes, however, the fruits which are late in ripening are apt to hang on the tree until spoiled by frosts; though weak watery fruits seem to be most injured in this manner; and Mr Marshall relates an instance of very fine liquor being made from golden pippins, after the fruit had been frozen as hard as ice.\n\n2. The method of gathering. This, as generally practised, is directly contrary to the principle laid down by Mr Marshall, viz., beating them down with long flender poles. An evident disadvantage of this method is, that the fruit is of unequal ripeness; for the apples on the same trees will differ many days, perhaps even weeks, in their time of coming to perfection; whence some part of the richness and flavour of the fruit will be effectually and irremediably cut off. Nor is this the only evil to be dreaded; for as everything depends on the fermentation it has to undergo, if this be interrupted, or rendered complex by a mixture of ripe and unripe fruits, and the liquor be not in the first instance sufficiently purged from its feculencies, it is difficult to clear the liquor afterwards. The former defect the cider-makers attempt to remedy by a mixture of brown sugar and brandy, and the latter by bullocks blood and brimstone; but neither of these can be expected to answer the purpose very effectually. The best method of avoiding the inconveniences arising from an unequal ripening of the fruit is to go over the trees twice, once with a hook, when the fruit begins to fall spontaneously; the second time, when the latter are sufficiently ripened, or when the winter is likely to set in, when the trees are to be cleared with the poles above mentioned.\n\n3. Maturing the gathered fruit. This is usually done by making it into heaps, as is mentioned under the article Cyder; but Mr Marshall entirely disapproves of the practice; because, when the whole are laid in a heap together, the ripest fruit will begin to rot before the other has arrived at that degree of artificial ripeness which it is capable of acquiring. \"The due degree of maturation of fruit for liquor (he observes) is a subject about which men, even in this district, differ much in their ideas. The prevailing practice of gathering into heaps until the ripest begin to rot, is wasting the best of the fruit, and is by no means an accurate criterion. Some shake the fruit, and judge by the rattling of the kernels; others cut through the middle and judge by their blackness; but none of these appear to be a proper test. It is not the state of the kernels but of the flesh; not of a few individuals, but of the greater part of the prime-fruit, which renders the collective bo-\nMaking of dy fit or unfit to be sent to the mill. The most rational test of the ripeness of the fruit, is that of the flesh having acquired such a degree of mellowness, and its texture such a degree of tenderness, as to yield to moderate pressure. Thus, when the knuckle or the end of the thumb can with moderate exertion be forced into the pulp of the fruit, it is deemed in a fit state for grinding.\n\n4. Preparation for the mill. The proper management of the fruit is to keep the ripe and unripe fruit separate from each other; but this cannot be done without a considerable degree of labour; for as by numberless accidents the ripe and unripe fruits are frequently confounded together, there cannot be any effectual method of separating them except by hand; and Mr Marshall is of opinion, that this is one of the grand secrets of cider-making, peculiar to those who excel in the business; and he is surprised that it should not before this time have come into common practice.\n\n5. Mixing fruits for liquor. Our author seems to doubt the propriety of this practice; and informs us, that the finer liquors are made from select fruits; and he hints that it might be more proper to mix liquors after they are made, than to put together the crude fruits.\n\nII. Grinding, and management of the fruit when ground.\n\n1. For the greater convenience of putting the fruit into the mill, every mill-house should have a fruit-chamber over it, with a trap-door to lower the fruit down into the mill. The best manner in which this can be accomplished, is to have the valve over the bed of the mill, and furnished with a cloth spout or tunnel reaching down to the trough in which the stone moves. No straw is used in the lofts; but sometimes the fruit is turned. In Herefordshire, it is generally believed, that grinding the rind and seeds of the fruit as well as the fleshy part to a pulp, is necessary towards the perfection of the cider; whence it is necessary, that every kind of pains should be taken to perform the grinding in the most perfect manner. Mr Marshall complains, that the cider-mills are so imperfectly finished by the workmen, that for the first fifty years they cannot perform their work in a proper manner. Instead of being nicely fitted to one another with the square and chisel, they are hewn over with a rough tool in such a careless manner, that horse-beans might lie in safety in their cavities. Some even imagine this to be an advantage, as if the fruit was more effectually and completely broken by rough than smooth stones. Some use fluted rollers of iron; but these will be corroded by the juice, and thus the liquor might be tinged. Smooth rollers will not lay hold of the fruit sufficiently to force it through.\n\nAnother improvement requisite in the cider-mills is to prevent the matter in the trough from rising before the stone in the last stage of grinding, and a method of stirring it up in the trough more effectually than can be done at present. To remedy the former of these defects, it might perhaps be proper to grind the fruit first in the mill to a certain degree; and then put it between two smooth rollers to finish the operation in the most perfect manner. It is an error to grind too much at once; as this clogs up the mill, and prevents it from going easily. The usual quantity for a middle-sized mill is a bag containing four corn bushels; but our author had once an opportunity of seeing a mill in which only half a bag was put; and thus the work seemed to go on more easily as well as more quickly than when more was put in at once. The quantity put in at one time is to be taken out when ground. The usual quantity of fruit ground in a day is as much as will make three hogsheads of perry or two of cyder.\n\n2. Management of the ground fruit. Here Mr Marshall condemns in very strong terms the practice of pressing the pulp of the fruit as soon as the grinding is finished; because thus neither the rind nor seeds have time to communicate their virtues to the liquor. In order to extract these virtues in the most proper manner, some allow the ground fruit to lie 24 hours or more after grinding, and even regrind it, in order to have in the most perfect manner the flavour and virtues of the seeds and rind.\n\nIII. Pressing the fruit, and management of the residue.\n\nThis is done by folding up the ground fruit in pieces of hair-cloth, and piling them up above one another in a square frame or mould, and then pulling down the press upon them, which squeezes out the juice, and forms the matter into thin and almost dry cakes. The first runnings come off foul and muddy; but the last, especially in perry, will be as clear and fine as if filtered through paper. It is common to throw away the residue as useless; sometimes it is made use of when dry as fuel; sometimes the pigs will eat it, especially when not thoroughly squeezed; and sometimes it is ground a second time with water, and squeezed for an inferior kind of liquor used for the family. Mr Marshall advises to continue the pressure as long as a drop can be drawn. \"It is found (says he), that even by breaking the cakes of refuse with the hands only gives the press fresh power over it; for though it has been pressed to the last drop, a gallon or more of additional liquor may be got by this means. Re-grinding them has a still greater effect: In this state of the materials the mill gains a degree of power over the more rigid parts of the fruits, which in the first grinding it could not reach. If the face of the runner and the bottom of the trough were dressed with a broad chisel, and made true to each other, and a moderate quantity of residue ground at once, scarcely a kernel could escape unbroken, or a drop of liquor remain undrained.\"\n\nBut though the whole virtue of the fruit cannot be extracted without grinding it very fine, some inconvenience attends this practice, as part of the pulp thus gets through the haircloth, and may perhaps be injurious to the subsequent fermentation. This, however, may be in a great measure remedied by straining the first runnings through a sieve. The whole should also be allowed to settle in a cask, and drawn off into a fresh vessel previous to the commencement of the fermentation. The reduced fruit ought to remain some time between the grinding and pressing, that the liquor may have an opportunity of forming an extract with the rind and kernels: but this must not be pushed too far, as in that case the colour of the cider would be hurt; and the most judicious managers object to the pulp remaining longer than 12 hours without pressure.\n\n\"Hence (says our author), upon the whole, the most eligible...\"\nMaking of eligible management in this stage of the art appears to be this: Grind one pressful a day; press and regrind the residuum in the evening; infuse the reduced matter all night among part of the first runnings; and in the morning reprefs while the next pressful is grinding.\n\nIV. Fermentation. The common practice is to have the liquor turned; that is, put into casks or hogheads immediately from the press, and to fill them quite full; but it is undoubtedly more proper to leave some space empty to be filled up afterwards. No accurate experiment has been made with regard to the temperature of the air proper to be kept up in the place where the fermentation goes on. Froth is prejudicial; but when the process usually commences, that is, about the middle of October, the liquor is put into airy shades, where the warmth is scarce greater than in the open atmosphere; nay, the casks are frequently exposed to the open air without any covering farther than a piece of tile or flat stone over the bunghole, propped up by a wooden pin on one side to cause the rain water to run off. In a complete manufactory of fruit-liquor, the fermenting room should be under the same roof with the mill-house; a continuation of the press-room, or at least opening into it, with windows or doors on every side, to give a free admittance of air into it; sufficient defences against froth; fruit-lofts over it, and vaults underneath for laying up the liquors after fermentation; with small holes in the crown of the arch to admit a leather pipe, for the purpose of conveying the liquors occasionally from the one to the other.\n\nIn making of fruit-liquors, no ferment is used as in making of beer; though, from Mr Marshall's account of the matter, it seems far from being unnecessary. Owing to this omission, the time of the commencement of the fermentation is entirely uncertain. It takes place sometimes in one, two, or three days; sometimes not till a week or month after turning: but it has been observed, that liquor which has been agitated in a carriage, though taken immediately from the press, will sometimes pass almost immediately into a state of fermentation. The continuance of the fermentation is no less uncertain than the commencement of it. Liquors when much agitated, will go through it perhaps in one day; but when allowed to remain at rest, the fermentation commonly goes on two or three days, and sometimes five or six. The fermenting liquor, however, puts on a different appearance according to circumstances. When produced from fruits improperly matured, it generally throws up a thick foam resembling that of malt liquor, and of a thickness proportioned to the species and ripeness of the fruit; the riper the fruit, the more foam being thrown up. Perry gives but little foam, and cyder will sometimes also do the same; sometimes it is intentionally prevented from doing it.\n\nAfter having remained some time in the fermenting vessel, the liquor is racked or drawn off from the lees and put into fresh casks. In this part of the operation also Mr Marshall complains greatly of the little attention that is paid to the liquor. The ordinary time for racking perry is before it has done rising, or sometimes when it begins to emit fixed air in plenty. The only intention of the operation is to free the liquor from its excess by a cock placed at a little distance from the bottom; after which the remainder is to be filtered through a canvas or flannel bag. This filtered liquor differs from the rest in having a higher colour; having no longer any tendency to ferment, but on the contrary checking the fermentation of that which is racked off; and if it loses its brightness, it is no longer easily recovered.—A fresh fermentation usually commences after racking; and if it become violent, a fresh racking is necessary in order to check it; in consequence of which the same liquor will perhaps be racked five or six times: but if only a small degree of fermentation takes place, which is called fretting, it is allowed to remain in the same cask; though even here the degree of fermentation which requires racking is by no means determined. Mr Marshall informs us that the best manufacturers, however, repeat the rackings until the liquor will lie quiet, or nearly so; and if it be found impracticable to accomplish this by the ordinary method of fermentation, recourse must be had to fumigation with sulphur, which is called fuming the casks. For this fumigation it is necessary to have matches made of thick linen cloth about ten inches long, and an inch broad, thickly coated with brimstone for about eight inches of their length. The cask is then properly leached, and every vent except the bunghole tightly stopped; a match is kindled, lowered down into the cask, and held by the end undipped until it be well lighted and the bung be driven in; thus suspending the lighted match within the cask. Having burnt as long as the contained air will supply the fire, the match dies, the bung is raised, the remnant of the match drawn out, and the cask suffered to remain before the liquor be put into it for two or three hours, more or less according to the degree of power the sulphur ought to have. The liquor retains a smell of the sulphurous acid; but this goes off in a short time, and no bad effect is ever observed to follow.\n\nIn some places the liquor is left to ferment in open casks, where it stands till the first fermentation be pretty well over; after which the froth or yeast collected upon the surface is taken off, it being supposed that it is this yeast mixing with the clear liquor which causes it to fret after racking. The fermentation being totally ceased, and the lees subsided, the liquor is racked off into a fresh cask, and the lees filtered as above directed. Our author mentions a way of fermenting fruit-liquors in broad shallow vats, not less than five feet in diameter, and little more than two feet deep; each vat containing about two hogsheads. In these the liquor remains until it has done rising, or till the fermentation has nearly ceased, when it is racked off without skimming, the critical juncture being caught before the yeast fall; the whole sinking gradually together as the liquor is drawn off. In this practice also the liquor is seldom drawn off a second time.\n\nCyder is made of three different kinds, viz., rough, sweet, and of a middle richness. The first kind being usually destined for servants, is made with very little ceremony. \"If it is but cyder (says Mr Marshall), and has body enough to keep, no matter for the richness and flavour. The rougher it is, the further it will go, and the more acceptable custom has rendered it not only to the workmen but to their masters. A palate accustomed to sweet cyder would judge the\nMaking of rough cider of the farm-houses to be a mixture of vinegar and water, with a little dissolved alum to give it roughnesses.\" The method of producing this aulter liquor is to grind the fruit in a crude under-ripe state, and subject the liquor to a full fermentation.—For the sweet liquor, make choice of the sweeter fruits; mature them fully; and check the fermentation of the liquor.—To produce liquors of a middle richness, the nature of the fruit, as well as the season in which it is matured, must be considered. The fruits to be made choice of are such as yield juices capable of affording a sufficiency both of richness and strength; though much depends upon proper management. Open vats, in our author's opinion, are preferable to close vessels: but if casks be used at all, they ought to be very large, and not filled; nor ought they to lie upon their sides, but to be set on their ends with their heads out, and to be filled only to such a height as will produce the requisite degree of fermentation: but in whatever way the liquor be put to ferment, Mr Marshall is of opinion that the operation ought to be allowed to go freely for the first time; though after being racked off, any second fermentation ought to be prevented as much as possible.\n\nV. Correcting, provincially called doctoring. The imperfections which art attempts to supply in these liquors are, 1. Want of strength; 2. Want of richness; 3. Want of flavour; 4. Want of colour and brightness.\n\nThe want of strength is supplied by brandy or any other spirit in sufficient quantity to prevent the acetic fermentation. The want of richness is supplied by what are generally termed sweets, but prepared in a manner which our author says has never fallen under his notice. To supply the want of flavour, an infusion of hops is sometimes added, which is said to communicate an agreeable bitter, and at the same time a fragrance; whence it becomes a substitute for the juices of the rind and kernels thrown away to the pigs and poultry, or otherwise wasted. The want of colour is sometimes supplied by elder berries, but more generally by burnt sugar, which gives the desired colour, and a degree of bitter which is very much liked. The sugar is prepared either by burning it on a salamander, and suffering it to drop, as it melts, into water; or by boiling it over the fire (in which case brown sugar is to be used), until it acquire an agreeable bitter; then pouring in boiling water in the proportion of a gallon to two pounds of sugar, and stir until the liquor become uniform. A pint of this preparation will colour a hogshead of cider. Brightness is obtained by a mixture of the blood of bullocks or sheep; that of swine being rejected, though it does not appear to be more unfit for the purpose than either of the other two. The only thing necessary to be done here is to stir the blood well as it is drawn from the animal, to prevent the parts from separating; and it ought to be stirred \"both ways, for a quarter of an hour.\" The liquor, however, is not always in a proper condition for being refined with this ingredient: on which account a little of it ought frequently to be tried in a vial. A quart or less will be sufficient for a hogshead. After the blood is poured in, the liquor should be violently agitated, to mix the whole intimately together. This is done by a stick slit into four, and inserted into the bunghole; working it briskly about in the liquor until the whole be thoroughly mixed. In about 24 hours the blood will be subsided, and the liquor ought instantly to be racked off; as by remaining upon the blood even for two or three days, it will receive a taint not easily to be got rid of. It is remarkable that this refinement with the blood carries down not only the faeces, but the colour also; rendering the liquor, though ever so highly coloured before, almost as limpid as water. Ifinglars and eggs are sometimes made use of in fining cider as well as wine.\n\nVI. The laying up or shutting up the cider in close casks, according to Mr Marshall, is as little understood as any of the rest of the parts; the bungs being commonly put in at some certain time, or in some particular month, without any regard to the state the liquor itself is in. \"The only criterion (says he) I have met with for judging the critical time of laying up, is when a fine white cream-like matter first begins to form upon the surface. But this may be too late; it is probably a symptom at least of the acetous fermentation, which if it take place in any degree must be injurious. Yet if the casks be bunged tight, some criterion is necessary; otherwise, if the vinous fermentation have not yet finally ceased, or should recommence, the casks will be endangered, and the liquor injured. Hence, in the practice of the most cautious manager whose practice I have had an opportunity of observing, the bungs are first driven in tightly, when the liquor is fine, and the vinous fermentation is judged to be over; and some time afterward, when all danger is past, to fill up the casks, and drive the bungs securely with a rag, and roast them over at top. Most farmers are of opinion, that after the liquor is done fermenting, it ought to have something to feed upon; that is, to prevent it from running into the acetous fermentation. For this purpose some put in parched beans, others egg-shells, some mutton suet, &c. Mr Marshall does not doubt that something may be useful; and thinks that ifinglars may be as proper as anything that can be got.\n\nVII. Bottling. This depends greatly on the quality of the liquors themselves. Good cider can seldom be bottled with propriety under a year old; sometimes not till two. The proper time is when it has acquired the utmost degree of richness and flavour in the casks; and this it will preserve for many years in bottles. It ought to be quite fine at the time of bottling; or if not so naturally, ought to be fined artificially with ifinglars and eggs.\n\nThe liquor, called cyderkin, purree, or perlin, is made Of cyder-of the muck or froth matter remaining after the cyder kin, is pressed out. To make this liquor, the muck is put into a large vat, with a proper quantity of boiled water, which has stood till it be cold again: if half the quantity of water be used that there was of cyder, it will be good; if the quantities be equal, the cyderkin will be small. The whole is left to infuse 48 hours, and then well pressed; what is squeezed out by the press is immediately turned up and stopped; it is fit to drink in a few days. It clarifies itself, and ferments in families instead of small beer. It will keep, if boiled, after wine, according to Dr Ruth's recipe.\n\nWe must not conclude this section without particular\nMaking of cider wine, which is made from the juice of apples taken from the press and boiled, and which being kept three or four years is said to resemble Rhenish. The method of preparing this wine, as communicated by Dr. Ruth of America, where it is much practised, consists in evaporating in a brewing copper the fresh apple-juice till half of it be consumed. The remainder is then immediately conveyed into a wooden cooler, and afterwards is put into a proper cask, with an addition of yeast, and fermented in the ordinary way. The process is evidently borrowed from what has long been practised on the recent juice of the grape, under the term of vin cuit, or boiled wine, not only in Italy, but also in the islands of the Archipelago, from time immemorial.\n\nThis process has lately become an object of imitation in the cider counties, and particularly in the west of England, where it is reported that many hundred hogsheads of this wine have already been made; and as it is said to betray no sign of an impregnation of copper by the usual chemical tests, it is considered as perfectly wholesome, and is accordingly drunk without apprehension by the common people. Others, however, suspect its innocence; whence it appeared an object of no small moment to determine in so doubtful a matter, whether or not the liquor acquires any noxious quality from the copper in which it is boiled. With this view Dr. Fothergill* made a variety of experiments, and the result seemed to afford a strong presumption that the cider wine does contain a minute impregnation of copper; not very considerable indeed, but yet sufficient, in the Doctor's opinion, to put the public on their guard concerning a liquor that comes in so very \"questionable a shape.\"\n\nIt is a curious chemical fact, he observes, if it be really true, that acid liquors, while kept boiling in copper vessels, acquire little or no impregnation from the metal, but presently begin to act upon it when left to stand in the cold. Can this be owing to the agitation occasioned by boiling, or the expulsion of the aerial acid? Atmospheric air powerfully corrodes copper, probably through the intervention of the aerial or rather nitrous acid, for both are now acknowledged to be present in the atmosphere. But the latter is doubtless a much stronger menstruum of copper than the former.\n\nIn the present process the liquor is properly directed to be passed into a wooden cooler as soon as the boiling is completed. But as all acids, and even common water, acquire an impregnation and unpleasant taste, from standing in copper vessels in the cold, why may not the acid juice of apples act in some degree on the copper before the boiling commences? Add to this, that brewing coppers, without far more care and attention than is generally bestowed on them in keeping them clean, are extremely apt to contract verdigris, (a rank poison), as appears from the blue or green streaks very visible when these vessels are minutely examined. Should the unfermented juice be thought incapable of acting on the copper either in a cold or boiling state, yet no one will venture to deny its power of washing off or dissolving verdigris already formed on the internal surface of the vessel. Suppose only one-eighth part of a grain of verdigris to be contained in a bottle of this wine, a quantity that may elude the ordinary tests, and that a bottle should be drunk daily by a person without producing any visible symptoms or internal uneasiness; yet what person in his senses would knowingly choose to hazard the experiment of determining how long he could continue even this quantity of a slow poison in his daily beverage with impunity? And yet it is to be feared the experiment is but too often unthinking made, not only with cider wine, but also with many of the foreign wines prepared by a similar process. For the grape juice, when evaporated in a copper vessel, under the denomination of vino cotto or boiled wine, cannot but acquire an equal, if not yet stronger impregnation of the metal, than the juice of apples, seeing that verdigris itself is manufactured merely by the application of the acid juices of grapes to plates of copper.\n\nIndependent of the danger of any metallic impregnation, the Doctor thinks, it may be justly questioned how far the process of preparing boiled wines is necessary or reconcileable to reason or economy. The evaporation of them must by long boiling not only occasion an unnecessary waste of both liquor and fuel, but also dissipates certain essential principles, without which the liquor can never undergo a complete fermentation; and without a complete fermentation there can be no perfect wine. Hence the boiled wines are generally crude, heavy, and flat, liable to produce indigestion, flatulence, and diarrhoea. If the evaporation be performed hastily, the liquor contracts a burnt empyreumatic taste, as in the present instance; if slowly, the greater is the danger of a metallic impregnation. For the process may be presumed to be generally performed in a vessel of brass or copper, as few families possess any other that is sufficiently capacious. Nor can a vessel of cast-iron, though perfectly safe, be properly recommended for this purpose, as it would probably communicate a chalybeate taste and dark colour to the liquor. At all events, brass and copper vessels ought to be entirely banished from this and every other culinary process.\n\nSect. X. Of Fences.\n\nWe shall conclude the present subject of agriculture by taking notice of the various kinds of fences that may be found valuable in it.—Robert Somerville, Esq., of Haddington, in a communication to the Board of Agriculture, has endeavoured to enumerate the whole simple and compound fences that are at present used.\n\nSimple fences are those that consist of one kind only as a ditch, a hedge, or a wall. Compound fences are made by the union of two or more of these, as a hedge and ditch, or hedge and wall. The following is the list which he has given of them:\n\n\"Simple Fences.\"\n\nI. Simple ditch, with a bank on one side.\nII. Double ditch, with a bank of earth between.\nIII. Bank of earth, with a perpendicular facing of sod.\nIV. Ha-ha, or sunk fence.\nV.

Reed fence, or port and rail, covered with reeds.\"\n\nOf the nature of each of these, and the advantages attending the use of them, we shall take some short notice. The ditch, which is one of the simple fences, is most frequently considered merely as an open drain intended to relieve the soil of superfluous moisture. It is frequently also, however, made use of without any such intention, as a fence for the confinement of cattle; but it is more frequently used with the double view of serving as a fence, and as a drain. It is made in a variety of ways, according to the object in view. If a ditch is meant to be used merely as a drain, the earth thrown out of it ought by no means to be formed into a bank upon the side of it, because such a practice, as formerly stated, when treating of draining, has a tendency to injure its utility by cutting off its communication with one side of the field to be drained; but when a ditch is intended to be used as a fence, a different rule of proceeding must be followed. In that case, the object in view will be greatly forwarded by forming the earth taken out of the ditch into a bank upon its side, which when added to the depth of the ditch, will form a barrier of considerable value.\n\nDitches are sometimes formed of an uniform breadth at top and bottom. This kind of ditch is liable to many objections. After frosts and rains, its sides are perpetually crumbling down and falling in, and if the field in which such a ditch is placed have a considerable declivity, the bottom of the ditch will be extremely liable to be undermined by any current of water, that either permanently or casually takes place in it; at the same time, such ditches have been found very useful in low-lying clay or cart soils where the country is level. From the nature of the soil, the sides of the ditches in such situations are tolerably durable. No rapid current of water can exist to undermine them; and, by their figure, they withdraw from the plough the smallest possible portion of surface.\n\nOther ditches are constructed wide above, with a gradual slope from both sides downwards. This form of a ditch is in general the best, where it is at all to be used for the drainage of the field, as the sides are not so liable as in the former case to be excavated by the current of water. Hence it is more durable, and by diminishing the quantity of digging at the bottom, it is more easily executed.\n\nA third kind of ditches are so formed as to have one side sloping, and the other perpendicular. This kind of ditch partakes of the whole perfections and imperfections of the two former. It is extremely useful, however, in fields of which sheep form a part of the stock, and where the bottom of the ditch contains a current of water; for, in such cases, when sheep tumble into a deep ditch, whose sides are pretty steep, they are very apt to perish; but by making one side of the ditch very much sloped, while the other approaches to the perpendicular, they are enabled to make their escape; while at the same time, by the bed of the stream being widened, the perpendicular side of the ditch is less liable to be undermined. When the earth taken out of a ditch is formed into a bank on one side, a projecting vacant space of 6 or 8 inches ought always to be left between the bank and the ditch, to prevent the earth from tumbling in and filling up the ditch.\n\nA double ditch, with a bank of earth between the two, formed out of the earth obtained by digging them, has many obvious advantages over the single ditch, when considered as a fence; for the earth taken out of the two ditches, when properly laid up in the middle, will naturally become a very formidable rampart, which cattle will not readily attempt to cross. It is also excellently adapted for the purpose of open drainage, and it ought always to be used upon the sides of highways, where the adjoining lands have a considerable declivity towards the road. In such cases, the inner ditch receives the water from the field, and prevents it from washing down or overflowing the road in the time of heavy rains; an inconvenience which frequently cannot otherwise be avoided.\n\nThe bank of earth, with a perpendicular facing of Bank of sod, and a slope behind, is useful in some situations, as earth in making folds for the confinement of sheep or cattle, in which case the front or perpendicular side of the bank\nFences. bank must be turned inwards. It is also valuable on the sides of highways to protect the adjoining fields, and also for fencing belts of planting, or inclosing stockyards and cottages. The front of the bank is made with the turf taken from the surface of the sloping ditch, and the mound at the back with the earth taken out of it. This fence, when well executed, is said to last a considerable time.\n\nThe ha-ha, or funk fence, very nearly resembles the mound of earth with the perpendicular facing of turf, with this difference, that the facing of the ha-ha is of stone. The height of both depends almost entirely upon the depth of the ditch; both of them in truth consist of the kind of ditch already mentioned, of which the one side slopes while the other is perpendicular, and differ from it chiefly in this respect, that the perpendicular side is faced with turf or stone. The stone-facing is made either of dry stone, or of stone and lime. In the Agricultural Report of Cromarty, the mode of making the funk fence is thus described: \"Upon the line where this fence is intended, begin to sink your ditch, taking the earth from as far as eight feet outward, and throwing it up on the inside of the lines. This ditch and bank is not made quite perpendicular, but inclining inward towards the field as it rises; to this is built a facing of dry stone, four feet and a half in height, one foot and three quarters broad at bottom, and one foot at top, over which a coping of turf is laid: the ditch or funk part forms an excellent drain. The whole of this is performed, when the stones (we shall suppose) can be procured at a quarter of a mile's distance, for 6d. per yard.\" The principal defect of the funk fence consists in this, that unless the bank at the back of it is considerably steep, or has a railing at the top, it forms a kind of snare on that side for cattle, as they must always be apt to tumble over it in dark nights.\n\nPalings or timber fences, are in many places much used, though they never can be considered with propriety as forming permanent inclosures. Of whatever materials they are formed, their decay commences from the instant they are erected. This decay begins with the part of the paling that is put into the ground, which is speedily rotted by the moisture, or consumed by worms or other animals that attack it. To guard as much as possible against this cause of decay, various devices have been adopted. It is a very general practice to burn the surface of that part of the standards of the paling which is meant to be driven into the earth. It is also customary to cover the same part of the wood with a strong coat of coarse oil paint, and Lord Donaldson's coal varnish has been recommended with this view. The points of the standards that are to be fixed in the earth, ought to be dipped in the varnish while it is boiling hot. Common tar or melted pitch have also been used with tolerable success to defend the extremities of the standards of paling. In some cases where the expense could be afforded, large stones have been sunk into the earth, with holes cut into them of a size adapted to receive the ends of the posts of the paling. The durability of the wood in this case is greater, but it bears no proportion to the additional expense incurred. When posts for paling can be obtained consisting of branches of trees, with the bark still upon them, this natural covering enables them to remain uncorrupted for a longer period than can be accomplished by any artificial coating. It is no objection to this, that a part of the uncovered wood, or the bottom of the stake or post must be inserted in the earth; for it is not at the bottom that stakes or posts begin to decay, but at the uppermost place at which the earth touches them, or between the wet and the dry as it is called. Of the kinds of paling it is unnecessary to say much.\n\nThe simple nailed paling of rough timber, consists of posts or stakes inserted in the earth, and crossed with three, four, or more horizontal bars or slabs as they are called in Scotland. It is the most common of all, and is used to protect young hedges, or to strengthen ditches when used as fences.\n\nThe jointed horizontal paling, consists of massive square poles drove into the earth, and having openings cut into them for the reception of the extremities of the horizontal bars. These openings, however, weaken the poles much, and cause them soon to decay; but this kind of paling has a very handsome and substantial appearance.\n\nThe upright lath paling, is formed by driving strong piles of wood into the earth, and crossing them at top and bottom, with horizontal pieces of similar strength. Upon these half are nailed, at every 6 or 12 inches distance, laths or pieces of fawn wood, of the shape and size of the laths used for the roofs of tiled houses. This kind of paling prevents cattle from putting their heads through to crop or injure young hedges or trees.\n\nThe horizontal paling of firs, or the weedings of other young trees, does not differ from the palings already described, unless in this respect, that the materials of which it is formed, consist not of timber cut down for the purpose, but of the thinnings of woods or belts of planting. Such palings are usually more formidable to cattle than any other, because when the lateral twigs that grow out of large branches are lopped off in a coarse manner, the branch still retains a roughness which keeps cattle at a distance.\n\nThe chain horizontal fence is made by fixing strong piles of wood in the earth in the direction in which the fence is to run, and fixing three chains at regular distances, extending horizontally from pile to pile, instead of cross bars of wood. Instead of posts of wood, pillars of mason work are sometimes used, and between these the chains are extended. A chain fence will confine horses or cattle, but is unfit to confine sheep or hogs. From its expensive nature, it can only be used in public walks, or for stretching across streams or pieces of water, where the inclosure can be completed in no other way.\n\nThe net fence is used for pleasure grounds, and instead of chains, as in the former case, it consists of a strong net extended between upright piles. Such a fence may be a very pretty ornament, but could be of little use against the horns of cattle.\n\nThe rope fence is constructed like the chain fence, and differs from it only in the use of cords instead of metal chains, and has the same defect of being useless against swine and sheep.\n\nThe moveable wooden fence or flake, or hurdle fence, consists of a kind of moveable paling, used for confining sheep or cattle to a certain spot when feeding upon a turnip field, and in this view it is extremely useful;\nuseful; for if the cattle were allowed to range at large over the field, a great quantity of the turnips would be destroyed by having pieces eaten from them, which would immediately spoil and rot before the remainder could be consumed; whereas, by the use of these moveable palings, the sheep or cattle having only a certain quantity of food allotted to them at a time, are compelled to eat it clean up without any loss.\n\nThe osier or willow fence, or wattled fence, is made by driving in the direction of the fence, stakes of willow or poplar, of half the thickness of a man's wrist into the earth, about 18 inches asunder. They are then bound together with small twigs of the willows or poplars twisted and interwoven with them. If the upright stakes have been recently cut down, and if the fence is made about the end of autumn, they will take root and grow in the spring. If their new lateral branches are afterwards properly interwoven and twisted together, they will become in two or three years a permanent and almost impenetrable fence.\n\nThe paling of growing trees, or rails nailed to growing posts, is formed by planting beech, larch, or other trees, at the distance of a yard from each other, in the direction in which the fence is wanted. When 10 or 12 feet high, they must be cut down to 6 feet. The cutting of the tops will make them push out a great number of lateral branches, which may be interwoven with the upright part of the tree, as in the case of the willow fence already mentioned.\n\nThe horizontal and upright flingle fence is formed in this manner; stout piles are driven into the earth, and deals of from half an inch to an inch thick, are nailed horizontally upon them in such a way, that the under edge of the uppermost deal projects over the upper edge of the one immediately below it, like slates or tiles upon houses. In like manner, the flingles or boards may be placed perpendicularly and bound together, by being nailed to horizontal bars of wood.\n\nThe warped paling consists of pieces of wood driven into the earth, which are twisted and interwoven with each other, so as to form a very open net-work; the tops of the pieces of wood being bound together by willow or other twigs.\n\nThe light open fence with thorns, or branches of trees woven into it, is nothing more than a common paling, whose interstices are filled up with thorns or branches of trees. It is a very effectual fence while it lasts.\n\nDead hedges are made of the prunings of trees, or the tops of live hedges that have been cut down. They are sometimes made upon the top of the mound of earth taken out of a ditch, by inserting the thick ends of the twigs in the earth, and making them rest in an oblique manner. Sometimes the stronger pieces or stakes are fixed in the earth, and the smaller twigs are used to fasten them together at top, by a kind of net-work. What is called the stake and rue fence in Scotland, consists of a dead hedge or fence, formed of upright posts, the intervals between which are filled up with twigs woven horizontally. All these, however, can only be regarded as fences of a very temporary nature, which are constantly in want of repairs, and therefore requiring a continual expense.\n\nBefore planting live hedges, it is proper to consider the nature of the land, and what sorts of plants will thrive best in it; and also, what is the soil from whence the plants are to be taken. As for the size, the letts ought to be about the thickness of one's little finger, and cut within about four or five inches of the ground; they ought to be fresh taken up, straight, smooth, and well-rooted. Those plants that are raised in the nursery are to be preferred.\n\nIn planting outside hedges, the turf is to be laid, with the grass-side downwards, on that side of the ditch on which the bank is designed to be made; and some of the soil mould should be laid upon it to bed the quick, which is to be set upon it a foot asunder. When the first row of quicks is set, it must be covered with mould; and when the bank is a foot high, you may lay another row of sets against the spaces of the former, and cover them as you did the others: the bank is then to be topped with the bottom of the ditch, and a dry or dead hedge laid, to shade and defend the under-plantation. Stakes should then be driven into the loose earth, so low as to reach the firm ground: these are to be placed at about two feet and a half distance; and in order to render the hedge yet stronger, you may edger it, that is, bind the top of the stakes with small long poles, and when the edging is finished, drive the stakes anew.\n\nThe quick must be kept constantly weeded, and free of manure from being cropped by cattle; and in February, or the month following, it will be proper to cut it within an inch of the ground, hawthorn, which will cause it strike root afresh, and help it much in the growth.\n\nThe crab is frequently planted for hedges; and if of the crab, the plants are raised from the kernels of the small wild crabs, they are much to be preferred to those raised from the kernels of all sorts of apples without distinction; because the plants of the true small crab never shoot so strong as those of the apples, and may therefore be better kept within the proper compass of a hedge.\n\nThe black thorn, or sloe, is frequently planted for black hedges; and the best method of doing it, is to raise thorn, the plants from the stones of the fruit, which should be sown about the middle of January, if the weather will permit, in the place where the hedge is intended; but when they are kept longer out of the ground, it will be proper to mix them with sand, and keep them in a cool place. The same fence will do for it when sown, as when it is planted.\n\nThe holly is sometimes planted for hedges; but Holly, where it is exposed, there will be great difficulty in preventing its being destroyed; otherwise, it is by far the most beautiful plant; and, being an evergreen, will afford much better shelter for cattle in winter than any other sort of hedge. The best method of raising these hedges, is to sow the stones in the place where the hedge is intended; and, where this can be conveniently done, the plants will make a much better progress than those that are transplanted: but these berries should be buried in the ground several months before they are sown. The way to do this, is to gather the berries about Christmas, when they are usually ripe, and put them into large flower-pots, mixing some sand with them; then dig holes in the ground, into which the pots must be sunk, covering them over with earth, about ten inches thick. In this place they must remain till the following October, when they should be taken\ntaken up, and sown in the place where the hedge is intended to be made. The ground should be well trenched, and cleared from the roots of all bad weeds, bulbes, trees, &c. Then two drills should be made, at about a foot distance from each other, and about two inches deep, into which the seeds should be scattered pretty close, lest some should fail. When the plants grow up, they must be carefully weeded; and if they are designed to be kept very neat, they should be cut twice a year, that is in May and in August; but if they are only designed for fences, they need only be sheered in July. The fences for these hedges, while young, should admit as much free air as possible; the best sort are those made with posts and rails, or with ropes drawn through holes made in the posts; and if the ropes are painted over with a composition of melted pitch, brown Spanish colour and oil, well mixed, they will last several years.\n\nHedges for ornament in gardens are sometimes planted with evergreens, in which case the holly is preferable to any other; next to this, most people prefer the yew; but the dead colour of its leaves renders those hedges less agreeable. The laurel is one of the most beautiful evergreens; but the holly is so luxuriant that it is difficult to keep it in any tolerable shape; and as the leaves are large, to prevent the disagreeable appearance given them by their being cut through with the sheers, it will be the best way to prune them with a knife, cutting the shoots just down to a leaf. The lauriflora is a very fine plant for this purpose; but the same objection may be made to this as to the laurel: this, therefore, ought only to be pruned with a knife in April when the flowers are going off; but the new shoots of the same spring must by no means be shortened. The small-leaved and rough-leaved lauriflora are the best plants for this purpose. The true phillyrea is the next best plant for hedges, which may be led up to the height of 10 or 12 feet; and if they are kept narrow at the top, there may be not too much width for the snow to lodge upon them, they will be close and thick, and make a fine appearance. The ilex, or evergreen oak, is also planted for hedges, and is a fit plant for those designed to grow very tall.—The deciduous plants usually planted to form hedges in gardens are, the hornbeam, which may be kept neat with less trouble than most other plants. The beech, which has the same good qualities as the hornbeam; but the gradual falling of its leaves in winter causes a continual litter. The small-leaved English elm is a proper tree for tall hedges, but these should not be planted closer than eight or ten feet. The lime-tree has also been recommended for the same purpose; but after they have stood some years, they grow very thin at bottom, and their leaves frequently turn of a black disagreeable colour.\n\nMany of the flowering shrubs have also been planted in hedges, such as roses, honeysuckles, sweet briar, &c., but these are difficult to train; and if they are cut to bring them within compass, their flowers, which are their greatest beauty, will be entirely destroyed. A correspondent of the society for improving agriculture in Scotland, however, informs us, that he tried with success the eglantine, sweet-briar, or dog-rose, when all the methods of making hedges practised in Essex and Hampshire had been tried in vain. His method was to gather the hips of this plant, and to lay them in a tub till March; the seeds were then easily rubbed out; after which they were sown in a piece of ground prepared for garden peas. Next year they came up; and the year after they were planted in the following manner. After marking out the ditch, the plants were laid about 18 inches asunder upon the side grass, and their roots covered with the first turfs that were taken off from the surface of the intended ditch. The earth side of these turfs was placed next to the roots, and other earth laid upon the turfs which had been taken out of the ditch. In four or five years these plants made a fence which neither horses nor cattle of any kind could pass. Even in two or three years none of the larger cattle will attempt a fence of this kind. Sheep indeed will sometimes do so, but they are always entangled to such a degree, that they would remain there till they died unless relieved. Old briars dug up and planted soon make an excellent fence; and, where thin, it may be easily thickened by laying down branches, which in one year will make shoots of six or seven feet. They bear clipping very well.\n\nDr Anderson, who hath treated the subject of hedges very particularly, is of opinion, that some other plants besides those above mentioned might be usefully employed in the construction of hedges. Among these he reckons the common willow. This, he says, by \"Effays on Agriculture,\" no means requires the wettest of soil which is commonly supposed. \"It is generally imagined (says he), that the willow can be made to thrive nowhere except in wet or boggy ground: but this is one of those vulgar errors, founded upon inaccurate observation, too often to be met with in subjects relating to rural affairs; for experience has sufficiently convinced me, that this plant will not only grow, but thrive, in any rich well cultivated soil (unless in particular circumstances that need not here be mentioned), even although it be of a very dry nature. It could not, however, in general be made to thrive, if planted in the same manner as thorns; nor would it, in any respect, be proper to train it up for a fence in the same way as that plant. The willow, as a fence, could seldom be successfully employed, but for dividing into separate inclosures of extensive field of rich ground: and, as it is always necessary to put the foil into as good order as possible before a hedge of this kind is planted in it, the easiest method of putting it into the necessary high tillth, will be to mark off the boundaries of your several fields in the winter, or early in the spring, with a design to give a complete fallow to a narrow ridge, six or eight feet broad, in the middle of which the hedge is intended to be planted the ensuing winter. This ridge ought to be frequently ploughed during the summer season, and in the autumn to be well manured with dung or lime, or both (for it cannot be made too rich), and be neatly formed into a ridge before winter.\n\n\"Having prepared the ground in this manner, it will be in readiness to receive the hedge, which ought to be planted as early in winter as can be got conveniently done; as the willow is much hurt by being planted late in the spring. But before you begin to make a fence of this kind, it will be necessary to provide a sufficient number of plants: which will be best done...\"\ndone by previously rearing them in a nursery of your own, as near the field to be inclosed as you can conveniently have it; for as they are very bulky, the carriage of them would be troublesome if they were brought from any considerable distance. The best kinds of willow for this use, are such as make the longest and strongest shoots, and are not of a brittle nature. All the large kinds of hood-willows may be employed for this use; but there is another kind with stronger and more taper shoots, covered with a dark green bark when young, which, upon the older shoots, becomes of an ash gray, of a firm texture, and a little rough to the touch. The leaves are not so long, and a great deal broader than those of the common hoop-willow, pretty thick, and of a dark-green colour.\n\nWhat name this species is usually known by, I cannot tell; but as it becomes very quickly of a large size at the root, and is strong and firm, it ought to be made choice of for this purpose in preference to all other kinds that I have seen. The shoots ought to be of two or three years growth before they can be properly used, and should never be less than eight or nine feet in length. These ought to be cut over close by the ground immediately before planting, and carried to the field at their whole length. The planter having stretched a line along the middle of the ridge which was prepared for their reception, begins at one end thereof, thrusting a row of these plants firmly into the ground, close by the side of the line, at the distance of 18 or 25 inches from one another; making them all plant a little to one side in a direction parallel to the line. This being finished, let him begin at the opposite end of the line, and plant another row in the intervals between the plants of the former row; making these incline as much as the others, but in a direction exactly contrary; and then, plaiting these basket-ways, work them into lozenges like a net, fastening the tops by plaiting the final twigs with one another, which with very little trouble may be made to bind together very firmly. The whole, when finished, assumes a very beautiful net-like appearance, and is even at first a tolerable good defence; and, as these plants immediately take root and quickly increase in size, it becomes, after a few years, a very strong fence which nothing can penetrate. This kind of hedge I myself have employed; and find that a man may plant and twist properly about a hundred yards in a day, if the plants be laid down to his hand: and, in a situation such as I have described, I know no kind of fence which could be reared at such a small expense so quickly become a defence, and continue so long in good order. But it will be greatly improved by putting a plant of eglantine between each two plants of willow, which will quickly climb up and be supported by them; and, by its numerous prickles, would effectually preserve the defenceself's willow from being browsed upon by cattle.\n\nAs it will be necessary to keep the narrow ridge, upon which the hedge is planted, in culture for one year at least, that the plants of eglantine may not be choked by weeds, and that the roots of the willow may be allowed to spread with the greater ease in the tender mould produced by this means, it will be proper to set the earth once or twice by a gentle horse-hoe in the beginning of summer; and, in the month of June, it may be sowed with turnips, or planted with cole-worts, which will abundantly repay the expense of the fallow.\"\n\nThe same author also gives the following useful directions for planting hedges in situations very much exposed to the weather, and recovering them when on the point of decaying. \"Those who live in an open and uncultivated country, have many difficulties to encounter, which others who inhabit more warm and sheltered regions never experience; and, among these difficulties, may be reckoned that of hardly getting hedges p. 16, &c., to grow with facility. For, where a young hedge is much exposed to violent and continued gusts of wind, no art will ever make it rise with too much freedom, or grow with such luxuriance, as it would do in a more sheltered situation and favourable exposure.\n\nBut although it is impossible to rear hedges in this situation to too much perfection as in the others, yet they may be reared even there, with a little attention and pains, so as to become very fine fences.\n\nIt is advisable in all cases, to plant the hedges upon the face of a bank; but it becomes absolutely necessary in such an exposed situation as that I have now described: for the bank, by breaking the force of the wind, screens the young hedge from the violence of the blast, and allows it to advance, for some time at first, with much greater luxuriance than it otherwise could have done.\n\nBut as it may be expected soon to grow as high as the bank, it behoves the provident husbandman to prepare for that event, and guard, with a wise foresight, against the inconvenience that may be expected to arise from that circumstance.\n\nWith this view, it will be proper for him, instead of making a single ditch, and planting one hedge, to raise a pretty high bank, with a ditch on each side of it, and a hedge on each face of the bank; in which situation, the bank will equally shelter each of the two hedges while they are lower than it; and, when they at length become as high as the bank, the one hedge will in a manner afford shelter to the other, so as to enable them to advance with much greater luxuriance than either of them would have done singly.\n\nTo effectuate this still more perfectly, let a row of service trees be planted along the top of the bank, at the distance of 18 inches from each other, with a plant of eglantine between each two services. This plant will advance, in some degree, even in this exposed situation; and by its numerous shoots, covered with large leaves, will effectually screen the hedge on each side of it, which, in its turn, will receive some support and shelter from them; so that they will be enabled to advance all together, and form, in time, a close, strong, and beautiful fence.\n\nThe service is a tree but little known in Scotland; although it is one of those that ought perhaps to be often cultivated there in preference to any other tree whatever, as it is more hardy, and, in an exposed situation, affords more shelter to other plants than almost any other tree I know: for it sends out a great many strong branches from the under part of the stem, which, in time, assume an upright direction, and continue to advance with vigour, and carry many leaves to\nFences, the very bottom, almost as long as the tree exists; so that if it is not pruned, it rises a large cloe bush, till it attains the height of a forest tree.\n\n\"It is of the same genus with the rawn-tree, and has a great resemblance to it both in flower and fruit; its branches are more waving and plant; its leaves undivided, broad, and round, somewhat resembling the elm, but white and mealy on the under side. It deserves to be better known than it is at present.\n\n\"But if, from the poorness of the soil in which your hedge is planted, or from any other cause, it should happen, that, after a few years, the hedge becomes sickly, and the plants turn poor and stunted in appearance, the easiest and only effectual remedy for that disease, is to cut the stems of the plants clean over, at the height of an inch or two above the ground; and after which they will send forth much stronger shoots than they ever would have done without this operation. And if the hedge be kept free of weeds, and trained afterwards in the manner above described, it will, in almost every case, be recovered, and rendered fresh and vigorous.\n\n\"This amputation ought to be performed in autumn, or the beginning of winter; and in the spring, when the young buds begin to show themselves, the stumps ought to be examined with care, and all the buds be rubbed off, excepting one or two of the strongest and best placed, which should be left for a stem. For if the numerous buds that spring forth round the stem are allowed to spring up undisturbed, they will become in a few years as weak and stunted as before; and the hedge will never afterwards be able to attain any considerable height, strength, or healthfulness.—I have seen many hedges, that have been repeatedly cut over, totally ruined by this circumstance not having been attended to in proper time.\n\n\"If the ground for fifteen or twenty feet on each side of the hedge be fallowed at the time that this operation is performed, and get a thorough dressing with rich manures, and be kept in high order for some years afterwards by good culture and meliorating crops, the hedge will prosper much better than if this had been omitted, especially if it had been planted on the level ground, or on the bank of a shallow ditch.\"\n\nMr Miller greatly recommends the black alder as superior to any other that can be employed in moist soils. It may either be propagated by layers or truncheons about three feet long. The best time for planting these last is in February or the month of March. They ought to be sharpened at their largest end, and the ground well loofened before they are thrust into it, lest the bark should be torn off, which might occasion their miscarriage. They should be set at least two feet deep, to prevent their being blown out of the ground by violent winds after they have made strong shoots; and they should be kept clear of tall weeds until they have got good heads, after which they will require no farther care. When raised by laying down the branches, it ought to be done in the month of October; and by that time twelvemonth they will have roots sufficient for transplantation, which must be done by digging a hole and loofening the earth in the place where the plant is to stand. The young fets must be planted at least a foot and a half deep; and their top should be cut off to within about nine inches of the ground; by which means they will shoot out many branches. This tree may be trained into very thick and close hedges, to the height of 20 feet and upwards. It will thrive exceedingly on the sides of brooks; for it grows best when part of its roots are in water; and may, if planted there, as is usual for willows, be cut for poles every fifth or sixth year. Its wood makes excellent pipes and staves; for it will last a long time under ground or in water: and it is likewise of great estimation among ploughwrights, turners, &c. as well as for making several of the utensils necessary for agriculture. Its bark also dyes a good black.\n\nThe birch is another tree recommended by Mr Miller as proper for hedges; and in places where the birch young plants can be easily procured, he says that the plantation of an acre will not cost 40 shillings, the after expense will not exceed 20 shillings: so that the whole will not come above three pounds. Ash trees ought never to be permitted in hedges, both because they injure the corn and grass by their wide extended roots, and likewise on account of the property their leaves have of giving a rank taste to butter made from the milk of such cattle as feed upon the leaves. No ash trees are permitted to grow in the good dairy counties.\n\nWhere there are plenty of rough flat stones, the fences which bound an estate or farm are frequently raised on made with them. In Devonshire and Cornwall it is common to build as it were two walls with these stones laid upon one another; first two and then one between: as the walls rise they fill the intermediate space with earth, beat the stones in flat to the sides, which makes them lie very firm, and so proceed till the whole is raised to the intended height. Quick hedges, and even large timber trees, are planted upon these walls, and thrive extremely well. Such inclosures are reckoned the best defence that can be had for the ground and cattle; though it can scarce be supposed, but they must be disagreeable to the eye, and stand in need of frequent repairs, by the stones being forced out of the way by cattle. The best way to prevent this is to build such wall in the bottom of a ditch made wide enough on purpose, and sloped down on each side. Thus the deformity will be hid; and as the cattle cannot stand to face the wall so as to attempt to leap over it, the stones of which it is composed will be less liable to be beaten down. The earth taken out of the ditch may be spread on the adjacent ground, and its sides planted with such trees or underwood as will best suit the soil. By leaving a space of several feet on the inside for timber, a supply of that valuable commodity may be had without doing any injury to the more valuable pasture.\n\nThe following is an excellent method of making a durable and beautiful fence in grassy places. Dig construct pieces of turf four or five inches thick, the breadth of an excellent spade, and about a foot in length. Lay these turfs fence in even by a line on one side, with the grass outward, at grassy places, at the distance of ten or twelve inches within the marks at which the ditch afterwards to be dug in the solid ground is to begin. Then lay, in the same manner, but with their grass sides turned out the contrary way, another row of turfs, at such a distance as to make a breadth of foundation proportioned to the intended height.\nheight of the bank. Thus, even though the ground should prove defective, the bank would be prevented from giving way. A ditch may then be dug of what depth and breadth you please; or the ground may be lowered with a slope on each side; and in this case there will be no loss of pasture by the fence; because it may be sown with hay-seeds, and will bear grass on both sides. Part of the earth taken out of the ditches or slopes will fill the chasm between the rows of turf, and the rest may be scattered over the adjacent ground. Three, four, or more layers of turf, may be thus placed upon one another, and the interval between them filled up as before till the bank is brought to its desired height; only observing to give each side of it a gentle slope for greater strength. The top of this bank should be about two feet and a half wide, and the whole of it filled up with earth, except a small hollow in the middle to retain some rain. Quickets should then be planted along this top, and they will soon form an admirable hedge. By this means a bank four feet high, and a slope only two feet deep, will make, besides the hedge, a fence six feet high, through which no cattle will be able to force their way: for the roots of the grass will bind the turf so together, that in one year's time it will become entirely solid; and it will yet be much stronger when the roots of the quick shall have shot out among it. The only precautions necessary to be observed in making this bank are, 1. Not to make it when the ground is too dry; because, if a great deal of wet should suddenly follow, it will swell the earth so much as, perhaps, to endanger the falling of some of the outside; which, however, is easily remedied if it should happen. 2. If the slope be such as sheep can climb up, secure the young quicks, at the time of planting them, by a small dead hedge, either on or near the top, on both sides. If any of the quicks should die, which they will hardly be more apt to do in this than in any other situation, unless perhaps in extremely dry seasons, they may be renewed by some of the methods already mentioned.—Such fences will answer even for a park; especially if we place posts and rails, about two feet high, a little sloping over the side of the bank, on or near its top: no deer can creep through this, nor even be able to jump over it. It is likewise one of the best fences for securing cattle; and if the quicks on the banks be kept clipped, it will form a kind of green wall pleasing to the eye.\n\nIn the first volume of the Bath Papers we find elms recommended for fences; and the following method of raising them for this purpose is said to be the best. When elm timber is felled in the spring, sow the chips made in trimming or hewing them green, on a piece of ground newly ploughed, as you would corn, and harrow them in. Every chip which has an eye, or bud-knot, or some bark on it, will immediately shoot like the cuttings of potatoes; and the plants thus raised having no tap-roots, but shooting their fibres horizontally in the richest part of the soil, will be more vigorous, and may be more safely and easily transplanted, than when raised from seeds, or in any other method. The plants thus raised for elm fences have greatly the advantage of others; as five, six, and sometimes more, stems will arise from the same chip; and such plants if cut down within three inches of the ground, will multiply their side shoots in proportion, and make a hedge thicker, without running into naked wood, than by any other method yet practised. If kept clipped for three or four years, they will be almost impenetrable.\n\nIn the second volume of the same work, we meet with several observations on quick hedges by a gentleman on man near Bridgewater. He prefers the white and black quick thorns to all other plants for this purpose; but is of opinion, that planting timber trees in them at proper intervals is a very eligible and proper method. He raised some of his plants from haws in a nursery; others he drew up in the woods, or wherever they could be found. His banks were made flat, and three feet wide at the top, with a sloping side next the ditches, which last were dug only two feet below the surface, and one foot wide at bottom. The turfs were regularly laid, with the grass downwards, on that side of the ditch on which the hedge was to be raised, and the best of the mould laid at top. The sets were straight, long, smooth, and even growing ones planted as soon as possible after taking up. They were planted at a foot distance; and about every 40 feet young fruit-trees or those of other kinds, such as ash, oak, elm, beech, as the soil suited them. A second row of quickets was then laid on another bed of fresh earth at the same time, and covered with good mould; after which the bank was finished and secured properly from injuries by a dead hedge well wrought together, and fastened by stakes of oak-trees on the top of the bank at three feet distance. Wherever any of the quickets had failed or were of a dwindling appearance, he had them replaced with fresh ones from the nursery, as well as such of the young trees as had been planted on the top of the bank; and cleared the whole from weeds. Those most destructive to young hedges are the white and black bryony, bindweed, and the traveller's joy. The root of white bryony is as big as a man's leg, and runs very deep; that of black bryony often grows to 30 feet long, and with a kind of tendrils takes hold of the root of the young quick; and chokes it. This root must be dug very deep in order to destroy it. The third is still more destructive to young quicks than the other two, overshadowing the hedge like an arbour. Its root is smaller than that of the two former, but must be dug out very clean, as the least piece left will send up fresh shoots. It is very destructive to hedges to allow cattle to browse upon them, which they are very apt to do; but where cattle of some kind must be allowed access to them, horses will do by far the least mischief.\n\nWith regard to the advantage arising from hedges, our author observes, that \"if they were of no further use than as mere fences, it would be the farmer's interest to keep them up carefully; for the better they are, the more secure are his cattle and crops.\" But if a judicious mixture of cyder fruit-trees were planted in hedges, the profit arising from them only would abundantly repay the cost of the whole without any loss of ground. It may possibly be objected by some, that the hedges would often be hurt by the boys climbing up to get the fruit: but those who make it should remember, or be told, that the best kinds of cyder-fruit are so hard and astringent at the time of their being gathered, that nobody can eat them, and even hogs\nFences. hogs will hardly touch them. But the greatest benefit, where no fruit-trees are planted, arises from the thorns and wood which quick hedges yield for the fire and other purposes.\n\nThe author of the Essays on Husbandry recommends the hornbeam plant as one of the best yet known for making fences, according to the method practised in Germany, where such fences are common. \"When the German husbandman (says he) erects a fence of this nature, he throws up a parapet of earth, with a ditch on each side, and plants his hornbeams sets in such a manner, that every two plants may be brought to intersect each other in the form of St Andrew's cross. In that part where the two plants cross each other, he gently scrapes off the bark, and binds them with straw thwart-wire. Here the two plants consolidate in a kind of indissoluble knot, and push from thence horizontal flanking shoots, which form a sort of living palisado or chevaux de frise; so that such a protection may be called a rural fortification. The hedges being pruned annually, and with discretion, will in a few years render the fence impenetrable in every part.\n\n\"It sometimes happens (says Dr Anderson) that a hedge may have been long neglected, and be in general in a healthy state, but full of gaps and openings, or too thin and straggling, as to form but a very imperfect sort of fence. On these occasions, it is in vain to hope to fill up the gaps by planting young quicks; for these would always be outgrown, choked, and starved, by the old plants: nor could it be recovered by cutting clear over by the roots, as the gaps would still continue where they formerly were. The only methods that I know of rendering this a fence are, either to mend up the gaps with dead wood, or to plait the hedge; which last operation is always the most eligible where the gaps are not too large to admit of being cured by this means.\n\n\"The operation I here call plaiting, may be defined, 'a wattling made of living wood.' To form this, some stems are first selected, to be left as stakes at proper distances, the tops of which are all cut over at the height of four feet from the root. The straggling side-branches of the other part of the hedge are also lopped away. Several of the remaining plants are then cut over, close by the ground, at convenient distances; and the remaining plants are cut perhaps half through, so as to permit them to be bent to one side. They are then bent down almost to a horizontal position, and interwoven with the upright stakes, so as to retain them in that position. Care ought to be taken that these be laid very low at those places where there were formerly gaps; which ought to be farther strengthened by some dead stakes or truncheons of willows, which will frequently take root in this case, and continue to live. And sometimes a plant of eglantine will be able to overcome the difficulties it there meets with, strike root, and grow up so as to strengthen the hedge in a most effectual manner.\n\n\"The operator begins at one end of the field, and proceeds regularly forward, bending all the stems in one direction, so that the points rise above the roots of the others, till the whole wattling is completed to the same height as the uprights.\n\n\"An expert operator will perform this work with much greater expedition than one who has not seen it done could easily imagine. And as all the diagonal wattlings continue to live and send out shoots from many parts of their stems, and as the upright shoots that rise from the stumps of those plants that have been cut over quickly rush up through the whole hedge, these serve to unite the whole into one entire mass, that forms a strong, durable, and beautiful fence.\n\n\"This is the best method of recovering an old neglected hedge that hath as yet come to my knowledge.\n\n\"In some cases it happens that the young shoots of a hedge are killed every winter; in which case it soon becomes dead and unsightly, and can never rise to any considerable height. A remedy for this disease may therefore be wished for.\n\n\"Young hedges are observed to be chiefly affected with this disorder; and it is almost always occasioned by an injudicious management of the hedge, by means of which it has been forced to send out too great a number of shoots in summer, that are thus rendered so small and weakly as to be unable to resist the severe weather in winter.\n\n\"It often happens that the owner of a young hedge, with a view to render it very thick and close, cuts it over with the shears a few inches above the ground the first winter after planting; in consequence of which, many small shoots spring out from each of the stems that has been cut over:—Each of which, being afterwards cut over in the same manner, sends forth a still greater number of shoots, which are smaller and smaller in proportion to their number.\n\n\"If the soil in which the hedge has been planted is poor, in consequence of this management, the branches, after a few years, become so numerous, that the hedge is unable to send out any shoots at all, and the utmost exertion of the vegetative powers enables it only to put forth leaves. These leaves are renewed in a sickly state for some years, and at last cease to grow at all—the branches become covered with fog, and the hedge perishes entirely.\n\n\"But if the soil be very rich, notwithstanding this great multiplication of the stems, the roots will still have sufficient vigour to force out a great many small shoots, which advance to a great length, but never attain a proportional thickness. And as the vigour of the hedge makes them continue to vegetate very late in autumn, the frosts come on before the tops of these dangling shoots have attained any degree of woody firmness, so that they are killed almost entirely by it: the whole hedge becomes covered with these long dead shoots, which are always disagreeable to look at, and usually indicate the approaching end of the hedge.\n\n\"The causes of the disorder being thus explained, it will readily occur, that the only radical cure is amputation; which, by giving an opportunity to begin with training the hedge anew, gives also an opportunity of avoiding the errors that occasioned it. In this case, care ought to be taken to cut the plants as close to the ground as possible, as there the stems will be less numerous than at any greater height. And particular attention ought to be had to allow very few shoots to arise from the stems that have been cut over, and to guard carefully against shortening them.\n\n\"But as the roots, in the case here supposed, will\nbe very strong; the shoots that are allowed to spring from the stems will be very vigorous, and there will be some danger of their continuing to grow later in the season than they ought in safety to do; in which case, some part of the top of the shoot may perhaps be killed the first winter, which ought if possible to be prevented. This can only be effectually done by giving a check to the vegetation in autumn, so as to allow the young shoots to harden in the points before the winter approaches. If any of the leaves or branches of a tree are cut away while it is in the state of vegetation, the whole plant feels the loss, and it suffers a temporary check in its growth in proportion to the loss that it thus sustains. To check, therefore, the vigorous vegetation at the end of autumn, it will be prudent to choose the beginning of September for the time of lopping off all the supernumerary branches from the young hedge, and for clipping off the side-branches that have sprung out from it; which will, in general, be sufficient to give it such a check in its growth at that season, as will prevent any of the shoots from advancing afterwards. If the hedge is extremely vigorous, a few buds may be allowed to grow upon the large stumps in the spring, with a view to be cut off at this season, which will tend to stop the vegetation of the hedge still more effectually.\n\nBy this mode of management, the hedge may be preserved entire through the first winter. And as the shoots become less vigorous every succeeding season, there will be less difficulty in preserving them at any future period. It will always be proper, however, to trim the sides of a very vigorous hedge for some years while it is young, about the same season of the year, which will tend powerfully to prevent this malady. But when the hedge has advanced to any considerable height, it will be equally proper to clip it during any of the winter-months, before Candlemas.\"\n\nLord Kames, in his work entitled the Gentleman Farmer, gives several directions for the raising and mending of hedges considerably different from those above related. For a deer-park he recommends a wall of stone coped with turf, having laburnums planted close to it. The heads of the plants are to be lopped off, in order to make the branches extend laterally, and interweave in the form of a hedge. The wall will prevent the deer from breaking through; and if the hedge be trained eight feet high, they will not attempt to leap over. He prefers the laburnum plant, because no beast will feed upon it except a hare, and that only when young and the bush tender. Therefore, no extraordinary care is necessary except to preserve them from the hare for four or five years. A row of alders may be planted in front of the laburnums, which no hare nor any other beast will touch. The wall he recommends to be built in the following manner, as being both cheaper and more durable than one constructed entirely of stone. Raise it of stone to the height of two feet and a half from the ground, after which it is to be coped with sod as follows. First, lay on the wall, with the grassy side under, sod cut with the spade four or five inches deep, and of a length equal to the thickness of the wall. Next, cover this sod with loose earth rounded like a ridge. Third, prepare thin sod, cast with the paring spade, so long as to extend beyond the thickness of the wall, two inches on each side, with these cover the loose earth, keeping the grassy side above; place them so much on the edge, that each sod shall cover part of another, leaving only about two inches without cover; when 20 or 30 yards are thus finished, let the sod be beat with mallets by two men, one on each side of the wall, striking both at the same time. By this operation, the sod becomes a compact body that keeps in the moisture, and encourages the grass to grow. Lastly, cut off the ragged ends of the sod on each side of the wall, to make the covering neat and regular. The month of October is the proper season for this operation, because the sun and wind, during summer, dry the sod, and hinder the grass from vegetating. Moist soil affords the best sod. Wet soil is commonly too fat for binding; and, at any rate, the watery plants it produces will not thrive in a dry situation. Dry soil, on the other hand, being commonly ill bound with roots, breaks to pieces in handling. The ordinary way of coping with sod, which is to lay them flat and single, looks as if intended to dry the sod and kill the grass; not to mention that the soil is liable to be blown off the wall by every high wind.\n\nThe advantages of a thorn hedge, according to our author, are, that it is a very quick grower, when planted in a proper soil; shooting up six or seven feet in a season. Though tender, and apt to be hurt by weeds when young, it turns strong, and may be cut into any shape. Even when old, it is more diploped than other trees to lateral shoots; and lastly, its prickles make it the most proper of all for a fence. None of these thorns ought to be planted in a hedge till five years of age, and it is of the utmost importance that they be properly trained in the nursery. The best soil for a nursery, his lordship observes, is between rich and poor. In the latter the plants are dwarfish; in the former, being luxuriant and tender, they are apt to be hurt during the severity of the weather; and these imperfections are incapable of any remedy. An essential requisite in a nursery is free ventilation. \"How of a common (says his lordship) is it to find nurseries in pernicious hollow sheltered places, surrounded with walls and railing high plantations, more fit for pine-apples than barberry trees! The plants thrust out long shoots, but feeble and tender: when exposed in a cold situation, they decay, and sometimes die. But there is a reason for every thing: the nurseryman's view is to make profit by buying ground, and by imposing on the purchaser tall plants, for which he pretends to demand double price. It is so difficult to purchase wholesome and well nursed plants, that every gentleman farmer ought to raise plants for himself.\n\nAs thorns will grow pleasantly from roots, I of raising have long practised a frugal and expeditious method of them from the wounded roots that must be cut off when thorns are to be set in a hedge. These roots, hedges cut into small parts, and put in a bed of fresh earth, will produce plants the next spring no less vigorous than what are produced from seed; and thus a perpetual succession of plants may be obtained without any more seed. It ought to be a rule, never to admit into a hedge plants under five years old; they deserve all the additional sum that can be demanded for them. Young and feeble plants in a hedge are of slow growth; and, besides the loss of time, the paling necessary to secure\nFences secure them from cattle must be renewed more than once before they become a fence. A thorn hedge may be planted in every month of winter and spring, unless it be frost. But I have always observed, that thorns planted in October are more healthy, push more vigorously, and fewer decay, than at any other time. In preparing the thorns for planting, the roots ought to be left as entire as possible, and nothing cut away but the ragged parts.\n\n\"As a thorn hedge suffers greatly by weeds, the ground where they are planted ought to be made perfectly clean. The common method of planting, is to leave eight or nine inches along a side of the intended ditch, termed a scarfement; and behind the scarfement to lay the surface soil of the intended ditch, cut into square sods two or three inches deep, its grassy surface under. Upon that sod, whether clean or dirty, the thorns are laid, and the earth of the ditch above them. The grass in the scarfement, with what weeds are in the moved earth, soon grow up, and require double diligence to prevent the young thorns from being choked. The following method deserves all the additional trouble it requires: Leaving a scarfement as above of ten inches, and also a border for the thorns, broad or narrow according to their size; lay behind the border all the surface of the intended ditch, chopped small with the spade, and upon it lay the mouldery earth that fell from the spade in cutting the said surface. Cover the scarfement and border with the under earth, three inches thick at least; laying a little more on the border to raise it higher than the scarfement, in order to give room for weeding. After the thorns are prepared by smoothing their ragged roots with a knife, and lopping off their heads to make them grow bushy, they are laid fronting the ditch, with their roots on the border, the head a little higher than the root. Care must be taken to spread the roots among the surface-earth taken out of the ditch, and to cover them with the mouldery earth that lay immediately below. This article is of importance, because the mouldery earth is the finest of all. Cover the stems of the thorns with the next stratum of the ditch, leaving always an inch at the top free. It is no matter how poor this stratum be, as the plants draw no nourishment from it. Go on to finish the ditch, pressing down carefully every row of earth thrown up behind the hedge, which makes a good solid mound impervious to rain. It is a safeguard to the young hedge to raise this mound as perpendicular as possible; and for that reason, it may be proper, in loose soil, when the mound is raised a foot or so, to bind it with a row of the tough sod, which will support the earth above till it become solid by lying. In poor soil more care is necessary. Behind the line of the ditch the ground intended for the scarfement and border should be summer fallowed, manured, and cleared of all grass roots; and this culture will make up for the inferiority of the soil. In very poor soil, it is vain to think of planting a thorn hedge. In such ground there is a necessity for a stone fence.\n\n\"The only reason that can be given for laying thorns as above described, is to give the roots space to push in all directions; even upward into the mound of earth. There may be some advantages in this; but, in my apprehension, the disadvantage is much greater of heaping so much earth upon the roots as to exclude not only the sun, but the rain which runs down the sloping bank, and has no access to the roots. Instead of laying the thorns fronting the ditch, would it not do better to lay them parallel to it; covering the roots with three or four inches of the best earth, which would make a hollow between the plants and the sloping bank? This hollow would intercept every drop of rain that falls on the bank, to sink gradually among the roots. Why, at any rate, should a thorn be put into the ground sloping? This is not the practice with regard to any other tree; and I have heard of no experiment to persuade me that a thorn thrives better sloping than erect. There occurs, indeed, one objection against planting thorns erect, that the roots have no room to extend themselves on that side where the ditch is. But does it not hold, that when, in their progress, roots meet with a ditch, they do not push onward; but, changing their direction, push downward at the side of the ditch? If so, these downward roots will support the ditch, and prevent it from being mouldered down by frosts. One thing is evident without experiment, that thorns planted erect may sooner be made a complete fence than when laid sloping as usual. In the latter case, the operator is confined to thorns that do not exceed a foot or fifteen inches; but thorns five or six feet high may be planted erect; and a hedge of such thorns, well cultivated in the nursery, will in three years arrive to greater perfection than a hedge managed in the ordinary way will do in twice that time.\"\n\nAfter the hedge is finished, it is absolutely necessary to secure it for some time from the depredations of cattle; and this is by no means an easy matter. \"The ordinary method of a palisade (says his lordship) is no sufficient defence against cattle: the most gentle make it a rubbing post, and the vicious wantonly break it down with their horns. The only effectual remedy is expensive; viz. two ditches and two hedges, with a mound of earth between them. If this remedy, however, be not palatable, the palings ought at least to be of the strongest kind. I recommend the following as the best I am acquainted with: Drive into the ground strong stakes three feet and a half long, with intervals from eight to twelve inches, according to the size of the cattle that are to be inclosed; and all precisely of the same height. Prepare plates of wood sawed out of logs, every plate three inches broad and half an inch thick. Fix them on the head of the stakes with a nail driven down into each. The stakes will be united so firmly, that one cannot be moved without the whole; and will be proof accordingly against the rubbing of cattle. But, after all, it is no fence against vicious cattle. The only proper place for it is the side of a high road, or to fence a plantation of trees. It will indeed be a sufficient fence against sheep, and endure till the hedge itself becomes a fence. A fence thus completed, including thorns, ditching, wood, nails, &c., will not much exceed two shillings every six yards.\"\n\nHis lordship disapproves the ordinary method of training hedges by cutting off the top and shortening up hedges, the lateral branches in order to make it thick and bushy. This, as well as the method of cutting off the stems two or three inches above the ground, indeed produces...\nproduces a great number of shoots, and makes a very thick fence, but which becomes so weak when bare of leaves, that cattle break through it in every part. To determine the best method of proceeding in this case, his lordship made an experiment on three hedges, which were twelve years old at the time he wrote. The first was annually pruned at the top and sides; the sides of the second were pruned, but not the top; and the third was allowed to grow without any pruning. The first, at the time of writing, was about four feet broad, and thick from top to bottom; but weak in the stems, and unable to resist any horned beast: the second was strong in its stems, and close from top to bottom: the third was also strong in its stems, but bare of branches for two feet from the ground; the lower ones having been deprived of air and rain by the thick shade of those above them. Hence he directs that hedges should be allowed to grow till the stems be five or six inches in circumference, which will be in ten or twelve years; at which time the hedge will be fifteen feet or more in height. The lateral branches next the ground must be pruned within two feet of the stem; those above must be made shorter and shorter in proportion to their distance from the ground; and at five feet high they must be cut close to the stem, leaving all above full freedom of growth. By this dressing the hedge takes on the appearance of a very steep roof; and it ought to be kept in that form by pruning. This form gives free access to rain, sun, and air: every twig has its share, and the whole is preserved in vigour. When the stems have arrived at their proper bulk, cut them over at five feet from the ground, where the lateral branches end. This answers two excellent purposes: the first is to strengthen the hedge, the gap that formerly attended to the top being now distributed to the branches; the next is, that a tall hedge stagnates the air, and poisons both corn and grass near it. A hedge trained in this manner is impenetrable even by a bull.\n\nWith regard to the practice of plashing an old hedge recommended by Dr Anderson, his lordship observes that \"it makes a good interim fence, but at the long run is destructive to the plants; and accordingly there is scarcely to be met with a complete good hedge where plashing has been long practised. A thorn is a tree of long life. If, instead of being massacred by plashing, it were raised and dressed in the way here described, it would continue a firm hedge perhaps 500 years.\n\n\"A hedge ought never to be planted on the top of the mound of earth thrown up from the ditch. It has indeed the advantage of an awful situation; but being planted in bad soil, and destitute of moisture, it cannot thrive; it is at best dwarfish, and frequently decays and dies. To plant trees in the line of the hedge, or within a few feet of it, ought to be absolutely prohibited as a pernicious practice. It is amazing that people should fall into this error, when they ought to know that there never was a good thorn hedge with trees in it. And how should it be otherwise? An oak, a beech, an elm, grows faster than a thorn. When suffered to grow in the midst of a thorn hedge, it spreads its roots everywhere, and robs the thorns of their nourishment. Nor is this all: the tree, overshadowing the thorns, keeps the sun and air from them. At the same time, no tree takes worse with being overshadowed than a thorn.\n\n\"It is scarce necessary to mention gaps in a hedge, because they will seldom happen where a hedge is trained as above recommended. But in the ordinary method of training, gaps are frequent, partly by the failure of plants, and partly by the trespassing of cattle. The ordinary method of filling up gaps is to plant sweet briar where the gap is small, and a crab where it is large. This method I cannot approve for an obvious reason: a hedge ought never to be composed of plants which grow unequally. Those that grow fast, overtop and hurt the slow growers; and with respect, in particular, to a crab and sweet briar, neither of them thrive under the shade. It is a better method to remove all the withered earth in the gap, and to substitute fresh faggot mould mixed with some lime or dung. Plant upon it a vigorous thorn of equal height with the hedge, which in its growth will equal the thorns it is mixed with. In that view there should be a nursery of thorns of all sizes, even to five feet high, ready to fill up gaps. The best season for this operation is the month of October. A gap filled with sweet briar, or a crab lower than the hedge, invites the cattle to break through and trample the young plants under foot; to prevent which, a palisade raised on both sides is not sufficient, unless it be raised as high as the hedge.\n\n\"Where a field is too poor to admit of a thorn hedge, if there be no quantity of stones easily procurable, whins are the only resource. These are commonly placed on the top of a dry earth dyke, in which situation they seldom thrive well. The following seems preferable. Two parallel ditches three feet wide and two deep, border a space of twelve feet. Within this space raise a bank at the side of each ditch with the earth that comes out of it, leaving an interval between the two banks. Sow the banks with whin seed, and plant a row of trees in the interval. When the whins are pretty well grown, the hedge on one of the banks may be cut down, then the other as soon as it becomes a fence, and so on alternately. While the whins are young, they will not be disturbed by cattle, if palisades be let to go out and in. These palisades may be closed up when the hedge is sufficiently strong to be a fence. A whin hedge thus managed, will last many years, even in strong frost, unless very severe. There are many whin hedges in the shire of Kincardine not skilfully managed, and yet the possessors appear not to be afraid of frost. Such fences ought to be extremely welcome in the sandy grounds of the shire of Moray, where there is scarce a stone to be found. The few earth fences that are there raised, composed mostly of sand, very soon crumble down.\"\n\nIn the fourth volume of Mr Young's Northern Tour, the author recommends the transplanting of old hedges, which his correspondent Mr Beverly says he has tried with prodigious success.\n\nMr Bakewell, we are told, is very curious in his fences, and plants his quicks in a different manner from Mr Bakewell what is common in various parts of the kingdom. He plants one row at a foot from set to set, and making his ditch, lays the earth which comes out of it to form a bank on the side opposite to the quick. In the common method, the bank is made on the quick side above it. Reasons are not wanting to induce a preference of this\nFences.\n\nThe plants grow only in the surface the earth uncovered from the atmosphere, which must necessarily be a great advantage; whereas, in the usual way of planting, that earth, which is always the best, is loaded by a thick covering obliquely of the earth out of the ditch. If the roots thoot in the best soil, they will be out of the reach of the influences of the air; the consequence of which is, that they cannot have so large a space of that earth as if set on the flat. The way to have a tree or a quick thrive in the best manner possible, is to set it on the surface without any ditch or trench, that cuts off half its pasture. But if a ditch is necessary, the next best way must of course be still to keep it on the flat surface; and the worst way to cover up that surface, by loading it with the dead earth out of a trench. To say that there are good hedges in the common method is not a conclusive argument, unless both were tried on the same foil and exposure.\n\nIn the 7th volume of the same work, a correspondent, who signs himself M. M., observes, that notwithstanding all the improvements that have been made in the construction of hedges and fences, there are many soils in England, which, from their sandy and gravelly natures, are little adapted to any of the plants in common use, and are therefore subject to all the inconveniences of dead hedges and gaps. Of this kind are all the sandy and gravelly inclosures, which constitute so large a part of many districts in the island. For these our author recommends a triple row of furze; though, notwithstanding its advantages, he says it is liable to be destroyed by severe winters, contrary to the affection of Lord Kames above related. \"It is liable (says he) to be completely cut off by a severe winter, that I have seen tracts of many hundred acres laid open in the space of a few weeks, and reduced to as defenceless a state as the surrounding wastes. On such soils therefore he recommends the holly; the only disadvantage of which, he says, is its slow growth. On most of these soils also the blackthorn will rise spontaneously; and even the quick, though slowly, will advance to a sufficient degree of perfection. The birch, however, he particularly recommends, as growing equally on the driest and on the wettest soils, propagating itself in such numbers, that, were they not destroyed, all the sandy wastes of this kingdom would be quickly covered with them. He recommends particularly the keeping of a nursery for such plants as are commonly used for hedges. \"I generally (says he) pick out a bit of barren land, and after ploughing it three or four times to bury and destroy the heath, I find it answer extremely well for a nursery. Into this spot I transplant quick, hollies, and every tree which I use for fences or plantations. By establishing such a nursery, a gentleman will always be able to command a sufficiency of strong and hardy plants which will not deceive his expectations. I look upon thorns of five or six years old, which have been twice transplanted from the seed-bed, to be the best of all; but as it may be necessary to fill up casual gaps in hedges that have been planted several years, a provision should be made of plants of every age, to twelve or fourteen years old. All plants which are intended to be moved, should be transplanted every two, or at most three years; without this attention, they attach themselves so firmly to the soil as renders a subsequent operation dangerous. All who transplant quicks or hollies ought to begin their labours as early as convenient in the autumn; for I have found, by repeated experience, that neither of these plants succeed so well in the spring.\"\n\nWhere the fences of a tract of ground are in a very ruinous condition, it is absolutely necessary to scour the ditches, throw up the banks, and secure the whole immediately by the firmest dead fences we can procure. If there is a total want of living plants, the cultivator can do nothing but plant new hedges; but if, as is generally the case, the banks are furnished with a multitude of old stems, though totally unconnected as a fence, the time and labour requisite for the intended improvement will be considerably abridged. All the frizzling branches which add no solidity to the fence are to be cut off; after which the rest of the stems must be shortened to the height of three or four feet. The method of cutting down everything to the ground, which is now so general, our author highly condemns. \"Such a fence (says he) has within it no principle of strength and connection; it is equally exposed in every part to depredations of cattle and sportsmen; and even though it escape these, the first fall of snow will nearly demolish it. On the contrary, wherever these vegetable palisades can be left, they are impenetrable either for man or horse, and form so many points of union which support the rest.\"\n\nAnother method of strengthening defensive fences is, to bend down some of the lateral hoots in a horizontal direction, and to spread them along the line of the farm, like espalier trees in a garden. A single stem, when it rises perpendicularly, will not secure a space of more than two or three feet, but when bent longitudinally, it will form a barrier at least sufficient to repel all cattle but hogs for twelve or fourteen on one side. By bending down, our author does not mean plashing of the common plashing method, which is very injurious to the plants; but the spreading two or three of the most convenient branches along the hedge, and fastening them down either by pegs or tying, without injury to the stem, until they habitually take the proposed direction. Those who make the experiment for the first time will be astonished how small a number of plants may be made to fill a bank, with only trifling intervals. The birch is particularly useful for this purpose; being of so flexible a nature, that hoots of ten or twelve feet in length may be easily forced into a horizontal direction; and if the other hoots are pruned away, all the juices of the plant will be applied to nourish the selected few: by which means they will in a few years acquire all the advantages of pots and rails, with this material difference, that instead of decaying, they become annually better. It is besides the property of all inclined branches to send up a multitude of perpendicular hoots; so that by this horizontal inclination, if judiciously made, you may acquire almost all the advantages of the thickset fence; but when the stems are too old and brittle to bear this operation, it will be advisable to cut off all the useless ones close to the ground, and next spring they will be succeeded by a number of young and vigorous ones. Select the best of these to be trained in the manner already directed, and extirpate all the rest, to increase their\ntheir vigour. The shoots of such old stems as have been just now described will attain a greater size in three or four years than any young ones that can be planted will do in twelve.\n\nAnother method which our author has practised with the greatest success is the following. The tender shoots of most trees, if bended downwards and covered with earth, will put forth roots, and being divided from the parent stem at a proper time, become fresh plants; an operation well known to gardeners, under the name of laying. This may be advantageous to the farmer, if he will take the very moderate trouble of laying down the young and flexible branches in his fences. Most species of trees, probably all, will be propagated by this method; but particularly the willow, the birch, the holly, the white thorn, and the crab, will also take root in this method, though more slowly; the latter being an excellent plant for fences, and not at all nice in the soil on which it grows. The advantage of laying down branches in this manner over the planting of young ones is, that when you endeavour to fill up a gap by the latter method, they advance very slowly, and are in danger of being stifled by the shade of the large trees; whereas, if you fortify a gap by spreading the branches along it in the manner just mentioned, and at the same time infert some of the most thriving shoots in the ground, they will advance with all the vigour of the parent plant, and you may allow them to grow until they are so fully rooted as to be free from danger of suffocation.\n\nIt frequently happens, that the fences of an estate have been neglected for many years, and exhibit nothing but ragged and deformed stems at great intervals. In this case it will be proper to cut them all off level with the ground: the consequence of this is, that next year they will put forth a great number of shoots, which may be laid down in every direction, and trained for the improvement of the fence. When this operation is performed, however, it ought always to be done with an axe, and not with a saw; it being found that the latter instrument generally prevents the vegetation of the plant. All the shoots laid down in this manner should be allowed to remain for several years, that they may be firmly rooted. Thus they will make prodigious advances; and it is to be observed, that the more the parent plant is divested of all superfluous branches, the greater will be the nourishment transmitted to the scions.\n\nOur author, however, is inclined to suspect that the most perfect form of a hedge, at least in all but those composed of thorns and prickly plants, is to train up as many stems as will nearly touch each other. The force of every fence consists chiefly in the upright stems: where these are sufficiently near and strong, the hedge resists all opposition, and will equally repel the violence of the bull, and the injurious attacks of the hogs. It is absolutely proper that all hedges should be inspected once a-year; when not only the ditch ought to be thrown out, and the bank supported, but the straggling shoots of all the live plants ought to be pruned. By these are meant all such as project over the ditch beyond the line of the hedge, and which add nothing to its strength, though they deprive the useful stems of part of their nourishment. Where a hedge is composed of plants of inferior value, it will be proper to train those in the manner just now recommended, and to plant the bank with quick or holly. When these last have attained a sufficient size, the others may be extirpated; which is best done by cutting down all the shoots repeatedly in the summer, and leaving the roots to rot in the hedge.\n\nIn the 13th volume of the Annals, W. Erskine, Esq., Mr Erskine gives an account of a method of fencing very much like his method, resembling that recommended by Lord Kames, and that of which has been already described. That gentleman is of opinion, that, in some cases dead stone walls, as they are called, are more advantageous than hedges. \"That hedges (says he) are more ornamental, cannot be denied; and they are generally allowed to afford more shelter; but the length of time, the constant attention, and continual expense of defending them until they bear even the resemblance of a fence, induces many people in those places where the materials are easily procured, to prefer the dry stone walls; for though the first cost is considerable, yet as the farmer reaps the immediate benefit of the fence (which is undoubtedly the most secure one), they are thought on the whole to be the least expensive; besides, the cattle in exposed situations, and especially in these northern parts, are so impatient of confinement at the commencement of the long, cold, wet nights, that no hedges I have ever yet seen, in any part of this island, are sufficient to keep them in.\"\n\nFrom considerations of this kind, the late Sir George Suttie of East Lothian was induced to think of a fence which might join the strength of the wall to the ornament of the hedge. His thorns were planted in the usual manner on the side of the ditch; but instead of putting behind them a post and rail or palings on the top of the bank, he erected a wall two feet and a half high; and being well situated for procuring lime, he used it in the construction of these walls which Mr Erskine greatly recommends; \"as the satisfaction they afford, by requiring no repairs, and the duration of them, more than repay the expense: but where the price of lime is high they may be built without any cement, and answer the purpose very well if the work is properly executed.\"\n\nIn making a new fence of this kind, the surface of the ground should be pared off the breadth of the ditch, and likewise for two feet more, in order to prevent as much as possible the thorns from being injured by the growth of grass and weeds. The ditch should be five feet broad, two and a half in depth, and one foot broad at the bottom. Leave one foot for an edging or facement, then dig the earth one spit of a spade for about one foot, and put about three inches of good earth below the thorn, which should be laid nearly horizontal, but the point rather inclining upwards, in order to let the rain drip to the roots; then add a foot of good earth above it: leave three or four inches of a facement before another thorn is planted; it must not be directly over the lower one, but about nine inches or a foot to one side of it: then throw a foot of good earth on the thorn, and trample it well down, and level the top of the bank for about three feet and a half for the base of the wall to rest on. This base should be about nine or ten inches, but must not exceed\nFences exceed one foot from the thorn. The wall ought to be about two feet thick at the bottom and one foot at the top: the cope to be a flingle stone laid flat; then covered with two fods of turf, the grats of the under-moist to be next the wall, and the other fods must have the grats side uppermost. The fods should be of some thickness, in order to retain moisture; so that they may adhere together, and not be easily displaced by the wind. The height of the wall to be two feet and a half, exclusive of the fods; which together should be from four to six inches, by which means the wall would be near to three feet altogether. The expense of the fences cannot be easily be counted, on account of the difference of the prices of labour in different parts. Mr Erskine had them done with lime, everything included, from 10s. to 13d. per ell (which is equal to 37 inches 2 parts), according to the ease or difficulty of working the quarry, and the distance of it from the place where the fence is erected. The lime costs about 6d. per boll of about 4087.2667 bushels; and from 15 to 16 bolls of lime are used to the rood of 36 square ells Scots measure; and there are upwards of 43 Scots ells, or 44 English yards. When the common round or flint stones are made use of, as they require more lime, it is necessary to use 30 or 35 bolls of lime to the rood. The thorns are sold from five to ten thillings per thousand, according to their age, reckoning five score to the hundred. Making the ditch, laying the thorns, and preparing the top of the wall, generally cost from 7d. to 8d. every five ells. About 50 carts of stones, each cart carrying from seven to nine cwt. will build a rood; the carriage at 2d. per cart for half a mile's distance.\n\nWarmth is undoubtedly extremely beneficial to hedges; and the walls give an effectual shelter, which in exposed situations is absolutely necessary for rearing young hedges; and they likewise preserve a proper degree of moisture about the roots. If the hedges have been planted for six or seven years before the wall is built, cut them over to two or three inches above the ground with a sharp tool, either in October or November, or early in the spring; and erect the wall as quickly in that season as possible (the spring in this country can scarcely be said to begin till the end of March). It is almost impossible to imagine the rapidity with which hedges grow in favourable situations. Mr Erskine had one cut over in the spring, and by the end of the year it was almost as high as the wall. In three years he supposed, that not even the Highland sheep, who easily overlap a wall of four feet and a half in height, would have been able to break through it.\n\nNotwithstanding the reasons that have been given already against the planting of timber trees in hedges, we find the practice recommended by some authors as one of the best situations for raising ship-timber. The reasons are, that the roots have free range in the adjoining inclosures, and the top is exposed to the exercise of the winds; by which means the trees are at once enabled to throw out strong arms, and have a large spreading head at the same time; so that we thus at once obtain quickness of growth with strength and crookedness of timber. Well trained timber trees it is alleged are not prejudicial to hedges, though pollards and low spreading trees are destructive to the hedge-wood which grows under them; neither are high trees prejudicial to corn-fields like high hedges and pollards, which prevent a proper circulation of air; and in Norfolk, where the cultivation of grain is carried on in great perfection; such lands are said to be wood-bound. But when a hedge is trimmed down to four or five feet high, with oaks interspersed, a circulation of air is rather promoted than retarded by it; and a trimmed hedge will thrive quite well under tall stemmed trees, particularly oaks. For arable inclosures, therefore, hedges are recommended of four or five feet high, with oak-timbers from 15 to 25 feet stem. Higher hedges are more eligible for grass-lands; the grats affect warmth, by which their growth is promoted, and consequently their quantity is increased, though perhaps their quality may suffer some injury. A tall fence likewise affords shelter to cattle, provided it be thick and close at the bottom; but otherwise, by admitting the air in currents, it does rather harm than good. The shade of trees is equally friendly to cattle in summer; for which reason it is recommended in grats inclosures to allow the hedge to make its natural shoots, and at the same time to have oak-trees planted in it at proper intervals. Upon bleak hills, and in exposed situations, it will be proper to have two or even three rows of hedge-wood, about four feet distant from each other; the middle row being permitted to reach, and always to remain at, its natural height; whilst the side rows are cut down alternately to give perpetual security to the bottom, and afford a constant supply of materials for dead hedges and other purposes of underwood.\n\nMuch has been said of the excellency of the holly as a material for hedges; and indeed the beauty of the plant, with its extreme closeness, and continuing planting throughout the winter, evidently give it the precedence over all others; and could it be raised with equal ease, there is no doubt that it would come into universal practice. Besides the above properties, the holly will thrive almost upon any soil; but thin-foiled stony heights seem to be its natural situation; and it may properly enough be said, that holly will grow wherever corn will. Its longevity is likewise excellent; and being of slow growth, it does not exhaust the land, as the farmers express it, or deprive the crop of its nourishment, as other hedges do. The difficulty of raising holly may be obviated by planting it under crabs, which have a tendency to grow more upright than hawthorns, and consequently affording more air, will not impede its progress though they afford shelter. It may even be raised alone without any great difficulty; only in this case the dead fence, to secure it, must be kept up at least ten or twelve years, instead of six or seven, as in the other case; and indeed, considering the advantages to be derived from fences of this kind, they seem to merit all the additional trouble requisite.\n\nThe holly may be raised either under the crab or hawthorn in two ways, viz. by sowing the berries when the quick is planted, or by inserting the plants themselves the ensuing midsummer. The former is by much the more simple, and perhaps upon the whole the better method. The seeds may either be scattered among the roots of the deciduous plants, or be sown in a drill in front: and if plants of holly...\nbe put in, they may either be planted between those of the crab, or otherwise in front in the quincunx manner.\n\n\"Whins (furze) have been often employed, says Dr Anderson, as a fence when sown upon the top of a bank. They are attended with the convenience of coming very quickly to their perfection, and of growing upon a soil on which few other plants could be made to thrive; but in the way that they are commonly employed, they are neither a strong nor a lasting fence. The first of these defects may, in some measure, be removed, by making the bank upon which they are sowed (for they never should be transplanted) of a considerable breadth; in order that the largeness of the aggregate body, considered as one mass, may, in some measure, make up for the want of strength in each individual plant. With this view, a bank may be raised of five or six feet in breadth at the top, with a large ditch on each side of it; raising the bank as high as the earth taken from the ditches will permit; the surface of which should be sowed pretty thick with whin seeds. These will come up very quickly: and in two or three years will form a barrier that few animals will attempt to break through, and will continue in that state of perfection for some years. But the greatest objection to this plant as a fence is, that, as it advances in size, the old prickle always die away; there being never more of these alive at any time upon the plant, than those that have been the produce of the year immediately preceding: and these thus gradually falling away, leave the stems naked below as they advance in height; so that it very soon becomes an exceeding poor and unsightly fence; the stems being entirely bare, and so slender withal as not to be able to make a sufficient resistance to almost any animal whatever. To remedy this great defect, either of the two following methods may be adopted. The first is to take care to keep the bank always sowed with young plants; never allowing them to grow to such a height as to become bare below: and it was principally to admit of this, without losing at any time the use of the fence, that I have advised the bank to be made of such an unusual breadth. For if one side of the hedge be cut quite close to the bank, when it is only two or three years old, the other half will remain as a fence till that side become strong again; and then the opposite side may be cut down in its turn; and so on alternately as long as you may incline: by which means the bank will always have a strong hedge upon it without ever becoming naked at the root. And as this plant, when bruised, is one of the most valuable kinds of winter food yet known for all kinds of domestic animals, the young tops may be carried home and employed for that purpose by the farmer; which will abundantly compensate for the trouble of cutting, and the waste of ground that is occasioned by the breadth of the bank.\n\n\"The other method of preserving a hedge of whins from turning open below, can only be practised where sheep are kept; but may be there employed with great propriety. In this case, it will be proper to sow the seeds upon a conical bank of earth, sowed up from the surface of the ground on each side without any ditches. If this is preserved from the sheep for two or three years at first, they may then be allowed free access to it; and, as they can get up close to the foot of the bank upon each side, if they have been accustomed to this kind of food, they will eat up all the young shoots that are within their reach, which will occasion them to find out a great many lateral shoots: and these being continually browsed upon, soon become as close as could be desired, and are then in no sort of danger of becoming naked at the root, although the middle part should advance to a considerable height.\n\nWhere furze or whins are to be used either as a fence by themselves, or in affluence to another, it is perhaps more proper to use the French seed than that produced in Great Britain, as the former seldom ripens in this country, and consequently cannot like the latter overrun the adjacent inclosure. It may be had at the seedshops in London for about 15d. per pound, and one pound will sow 40 statute roods. When used as an affluence to a hedge, it is more proper to sow it on the back of the bank than on the top of it; as in this case it is more apt to overhang the young plants in the face of the bank; whilst in the other it is better situated for guarding the bank, and preventing it from being torn down by cattle. The method of sowing is as follows: Chop a drill with a sharp spade about two-thirds of the way up the back of the bank, making the cleft gape as wide as may be without breaking off the lip; and having the seed in a quart bottle, stopped with a cork and goose quill, or with a perforated wooden stopper, trickle it along the drill, covering it by means of a broom drawn gently above and over the mouth of the drill. Clopping the drill with the back of the spade, thrusts up the seeds too much from the air, and thus keeps them too long from rising.\n\nWe do not know that any person has yet attempted to make use of the gooseberry for the purpose of making hedges, though few plants seem better adapted for that purpose. It grows readily. Some varieties of it rise to a considerable height, and by the strength and number of its prickle, it would effectually prevent any animal from breaking through.—It is said that some species of the mulberry not only grow and thrive in England, but are capable of being reared to perfection in Scotland, as has been experienced at Dalkeith. As the leaves of this plant are the food of the silk-worm, which produces the most beautiful and valuable of all the materials that can occupy the loom, it is perhaps worthy of attention how far it might be worth while to rear it as a fence in hedge-rows with a view to its becoming the basis of a valuable manufacture.\n\nDry stone walls are sometimes erected of those round stones of apparently water-worn stones which the ploughstone wall throws out, and which may be gathered in every field. They are usually coped with sod. This, however, is a very indifferent fence. In most instances it is erected by common labourers, and is therefore ill constructed, so as not even to be of an uniform thickness from top to bottom. The round figure of the stones also prevents the building from being well bound together. Even the cattle rubbing themselves against it are apt to make considerable gaps, which render constant attention necessary to keep it in repair. It is cheaply executed, however, and affords the means of at once fencing the land and clearing it of stones. When dry stone walls are skillfully built by\nFences by masons, and made with quarried stones finished with a good coping, they look well and last for many years; but the coping ought to be of stone and not of turf or mud.\n\nTo render stone and lime walls valuable as fences, they should have a broad base, and have a foundation sufficiently deep to prevent their being injured by the loosening of the soil which is produced by frost. This fence is very durable, but it is also very expensive. To be in perfection, it ought to be executed not with common stones gathered from the fields, but with stones from the quarry: it ought to be secured at the top with a coping of stone of the flag kind laid together in such a way as to render the wall narrow at top like the roof of a house. If the coping is neglected, the moisture soon finds its way into the heart of the wall, and it is also liable to various accidents from idle persons climbing over it.\n\nThe Galloway dike owes its name to the county in which it was first used. It consists of a broad building of dry stones tapering upwards. Large flat stones are then laid on like a coping, and project over the wall on each side. Above these stones large rugged round stones are laid, and smaller stones above them, so as to admit a free passage to the wind which whistles through them. The Galloway dike is never raised very high, but its tottering appearance so terrifies the cattle and sheep, that they dare not touch it; so that it is a very effectual fence, though it neither affords shelter nor ornament to the country. It has the advantage, however, of being erected at a very trifling expense; it is not unsuitable to those lower parts of the country in which the shelter of high trees and hedges would prove pernicious to the corn crop, and where the confinement of the stock is all that is required.\n\nClay is sometimes used instead of lime for binding stone walls; but it is a very defective cement; for if frost suddenly succeeds to wet weather it is apt to swell and to tumble down at the next thaw. To guard against the effects of moisture, these stone and clay walls are sometimes rough-cast or coated over with lime. If the coating is very thick and the wall properly coped, it may last in this way as long as a wall of stone and lime.\n\nFor the sake of the appearance, dry-stone walls have sometimes two or three inches at the top of them on each side lipped or washed with lime, which adds nothing to their strength, but gives them the appearance of being built entirely with stone and lime. With the same view, and with the same effect, they are sometimes also broad-cast or coated with lime over their whole surface. Dry-stone walls, after they are finished are sometimes pinned and harled, or rough-cast, that is, the mason fills up all the interstices of the building with small stones, and afterwards coats it over with lime, which adds considerably to its durability.\n\nLow dry-stone walls have sometimes a light paling at the top, which gives them a handsome appearance.\n\nBrick walls are sometimes used where stones are extremely scarce, but they are chiefly employed for facing garden walls.\n\nFrame walls are constructed in the following manner. A frame of boards of the width and height intended for the future wall is placed upon the line that has been dug for a foundation. The frame is filled to the top with stones gathered from the adjoining fields, and a quantity of liquid mortar is poured in amongst them sufficient to fill up every interstice. The whole is allowed to remain for a day or two, or longer, till the building is dried so far as to have acquired some stability. The frame is then removed, and placed a little farther on in the same line, but in contact with the last-made piece of wall, and the operation is renewed. This is supposed to have been a very ancient mode of building.\n\nTurf walls are found very useful in upland districts for temporary purposes, such as for folds, or for protecting young plantations or young hedges. Their strength is sometimes increased, without augmenting the expense of the construction, by intermingling them with stones, that is, by forming the wall of alternate layers of turf and stone.\n\nMud walls with a mixture of straw, are very frequent in many places both of England and Scotland, and they are used not only for fences, but also for constructing the walls of farm houses and offices, in the poorer parts of the country. They are formed in the following manner. Straw and clay are incorporated with each other, like hair with plaster of lime, and formed into large pieces. A stratum of these is laid at the bottom of the intended wall. The different pieces are then firmly kneaded with the hand, and pressed at each side with a flat board, which not only consolidates, but gives smoothness and uniformity to the work. Successive strata are added till the wall is raised to its intended height. If walls thus constructed are properly coated with lime, to protect them against moisture, they become very durable; and their appearance is not inferior to that of a stone and lime building.\n\nOf compound fences, the most ordinary is the single compound hedge and ditch, with or without palings. The mode of planting these hedges has been already stated on the authority of Lord Kames and others; and we shall only add, that if a hedge is wished to rise with rapidity, the spot in which it is planted ought to be enriched with lime, compost, or other manures, as hedge plants cannot, any more than other plants, spring rapidly without cultivation. Where a hedge is planted at the top of a ditch, it may also be remarked, that it is doubly necessary to give the ditch a proper degree of slope, that it may not be undermined by any accident, which would have the effect to lay bare the roots of the hedge, or entirely to bring it down. Where it is wished to render lands inclosed with hedge and ditch fenceable at once, a kind of Galloway dike, consisting of some rows of large coarse loose stones, may be placed upon the top of the bank, which will have the effect of protecting the hedge against cattle.\n\nThe double ditch with a hedge in the front of each, is now practised, particularly on cold lands, in many parts of Great Britain. It may be remarked, that where these double ditches are wanted for drains, it is undoubtedly a proper practice; but in other situations it is exceptionable, as laying out unprofitably a large portion of the soil.\n\nWhen a hedge and ditch is used, whether single or double, the hedge is sometimes placed not at the bottom of the bank, which is the usual way, but in the middle of it, at some height above the ordinary surface of the field. In such a mode of planting, the hedge is exposed\nexposed to great injury from the bank mouldering down, and from want of proper nourishment; but the practice is sometimes necessary upon wet lands, where hedges would not thrive, if placed upon the common surface. Sometimes the face of a natural declivity is cut down, in a sloping direction, to within 18 or 20 inches of the bottom. Here a bank is made and covered with good earth, in which the plants are inserted. A hedge planted in this way looks formidable, from the side facing the bank; but it is exposed to more accidents, from a failure of its soil in consequence of frosts, than if planted at the bottom of the bank.\n\nSometimes what is called a hedge and bank, or hedge on the top of a bank, is made use of. It consists of a bank of earth taken from the adjoining grounds, broad at bottom and tapering towards the top, along the summit of which the hedge is planted. Such hedges are extremely liable to decay, in consequence of the artificial mound on which they stand, being unable to retain sufficient moisture for their support, or being washed away from about their roots.\n\nThe Devonshire fence resembles the one now described. It consists of an earthen mound 7 feet wide at bottom, and 4 feet at the top, and 5 feet in height. In the middle of the top of it a row of quicks is planted, and on each side at two feet distance a row of willow stakes, of about an inch in diameter each, and from 18 inches to two feet in length, is stuck in, sloping a little outwards. These stakes take root, and form a kind of live fence for the preservation of the quicks in the middle.\n\nPalings are frequently employed for the protection of young hedges, whether planted on the plain soil or on the top of a ditch; dead hedges, of the kinds formerly mentioned, are also employed for the same purpose. The dead hedge is preferable to the paling, as it shelters the young plants from the inclemency of the weather. The dead hedge, however, ought always to be at some distance from the living one, to allow the latter freely to put forth its branches. As already noticed, walls of different kinds are sometimes erected, whether Galloway dikes or of stone and lime, for the protection of young hedges; but there is a mode of making a hedge in the middle or in the face of a wall which deserves attention. It is executed in the following manner: The face of the bank is first cut down not quite perpendicular, but nearly so. A facing of stone is then begun at the bottom, and carried up regularly in the manner that stone walls are generally built. When it is raised about 18 inches or 2 feet high, according to circumstances, the space between the wall and the bank is filled up with good earth, well broken and mixed with lime or compost. The thorns are laid upon this earth in such a manner, as that at last 4 inches of the root and stem shall rest upon the earth, and the extremity of the top shall project beyond the wall. When the plants are thus regularly laid, the roots are covered with earth, and the wall continued upwards, a hole having been left which each plant peeps through. As the wall advances upwards, the space between it and the bank is gradually filled up: when completed the wall is finished with a coping of sod or of stone and lime. When the plants begin to vegetate, the young shoots appear in the face of the wall, rising in a perpendicular direction.\n\nIt is said, that Sir James Hall of Dunglass has adopted this mode of inclosing to a considerable extent in East Lothian; that the hedges have made great progress; and that they exhibit, upon the whole, an extremely handsome appearance.\n\nWhatever may be thought of the propriety of planting trees in hedge-rows, there can be no doubt, that in planting certain situations the addition to a hedge or hedge and ditch of a belt of planting is a valuable acquisition to its owner and to the country. It is certain, however, as formerly stated, that in low rich soils where corn is chiefly cultivated, particularly when surrounded by hills, belts of planting are not only unnecessary, but even hurtful to the crop. But there are other situations in which they are of the highest value. The peninsula, which forms the county of Caithness, is said to be a proof of this. Its soil is of a good quality, but its value is greatly impaired by its being exposed to sea-winds, whose severity checks all vegetation. Many tracts throughout the island are nearly in the same situation; and in all of them nothing more is wanted to improve the country than to interject it in a judicious manner with hedges and belts of planting. Where belts of planting are meant to remain as an efficient fence, they ought to be of a considerable breadth. In poor and cold situations the breadth ought to be such as to allow space for planting a great number of trees, which, from the shelter they mutually afford, may protect each others growth against the severity of the climate. With the same view, in cold and exposed situations, the young trees should be planted very thick; perhaps four or five times the number that can grow to a full size should be planted. This practice affords a choice of the most healthy plants to be left when the plantation is thinned. In belts of planting an error is sometimes committed of mingling firs, larches, and pines, with oaks, ashes, &c., with the intention that the evergreens should protect for a certain time the other trees, and thereafter be removed. The effect of which too frequently is, that when the evergreens are taken away, their growth is not only checked for several years; but being unable, after experiencing too much shelter, to resist the severity of the climate, they die altogether. This is the more likely to happen in consequence of the rapidity with which the firs and larches grow; for the oaks and other trees are drawn up along with them, and acquire, in some measure, the nature of hot-house plants, unfit to encounter the blasts of a northern climate: hence belts of planting should either be made altogether of evergreens or altogether of deciduous plants, such as oak, ash, &c. If the evergreens are at all introduced among these last, it ought to be sparingly, and at the outside of the belt, with the view to afford only a moderate degree of shelter.\n\nWhere fields are meant to remain constantly in pasture, the belts may be made in a serpentine, and sometimes in a circular form, both for the sake of ornament, and to afford more complete shelter; but this cannot be done where the plough is meant to be introduced. Upon a north exposure, the belts should cross each other at proper distances to afford more complete shelter. Upon a south exposure, they ought to run from south, to north to afford a defence against the east and west winds which are the strongest in this country.\nFences. Belts of planting require themselves to be fenced. A fence, which is merely intended to protect their growth, may consist of a mud wall; but if a permanent security is wanted, a hedge and ditch will be necessary.\n\nIn some situations, instead of the belt of planting, it is customary to plant only the corners of the fields; and this plan is advisable where the country requires but a moderate degree of shelter, added to that which it may derive from thriving hedges.\n\nIt has been proposed, that on all sheep farms of any extent, there ought to be one or more circular belts of planting, including a space of about an acre or an acre and a half in the centre, with a serpentine road leading through the belt into this inclosure, the use of which is evident. In heavy falls of snow numerous flocks are sometimes buried, and the lives of the sheep-herds are not unfrequently lost in attempting to drive them to a place of safety. On such occasions, the inclosures we have now mentioned, would be of the utmost value. When a storm threatened, the sheep might be driven to these inclosures where the snow could never be piled up by driving winds; and they might there be fed and remain with entire safety. If due care were taken to litter the place, a quantity of valuable dung might be collected, if the storm should remain for any length of time.\n\nThe reed fence has hitherto been only used in gardens. It consists of a kind of wall, formed by sewing with wrought yarn bundles of reeds, applied perpendicularly to a railing. This fence seems well adapted for giving temporary shelter to cattle, but as the materials of it cannot be everywhere found, its use must be very limited.\n\nThe entry to every inclosure ought to be secured by gate-posts; which, if circumstances will permit, ought always to be of stone, and if possible, of hewn stone, as these, when properly constructed, will never fail. Trees are sometimes planted for this purpose, and when they have acquired a certain size, they are cut over about ten feet above the surface of the ground. These form the most durable of all gate-posts. They sometimes, however, misfire; in which case it is difficult to repair the defect. When gate-posts are made of dead timber they should be strong, and the wood well prepared by a coat of oil paint, as already mentioned.\n\nOf gates for inclosures there are different kinds. What is called the swing-gate, that crosses the whole breadth of a carriage road, and is of one piece, is by no means an admirable form. The length of its bars renders it expensive, and its great weight with which it pulls against the gate-post, overstrains its own hinges, and is apt to bring down the side of the gate, unless it is erected in a very costly and solid manner. For this reason, a gate with two folding doors is preferable: it hangs upon the gate-post only with half its weight, in consequence of its being divided into two parts. Its hinges are not so liable to be hurt by straining, nor are its joints so liable to be broke. What is called the flip-bar gate, consisting of three separate bars which are taken out, and put into the gate-posts every time the entry to the fields is opened and shut, is the best kind of gate, so far as cheapness and durability are concerned; but it does not admit of being locked, which renders it unfit for use near a public road, and the opening and shutting of it are also attended with a considerable degree of trouble.\n\nINDEX.\n\nA\n\nAchillea millefolium, No 62\nAgriculture defined, 1\nwherein it differs from gardening, 1\nis a separate art or employment, 3\nincludes the rearing of cattle, 4\ngeneral importance of, 5\nadvantage of, to the farmer, 6\nhistory of, 7\nboard of, 8\ntheory defective, 11\nPractice of division of the subject, 116\nAgricultural improvement, obstacles to, 115\nAgrostis cornucopiae, capillaris, 406\nAreira flexuosa, caryophyllacea, 401\nAlopecurus bulbosus, 394\nAnderson's, Dr, opinion of the nature of mols, 193\nAngora breed of rabbits, 593\n\nAntibacanthum odoratum, No 397\nArfenic used to prevent the mildew, 102\n\nB\n\nBank of earth fence, 660\nBarley, culture of, 201\nribbing, 202\nbetter mode of, 263\nadvantages of, 264\nfeed, how managed in a dry season, 265\nexperiments on, 266\ntime of sowing, 267\ngeneral remarks on the culture of, 268\nculture in Norfolk, 269\nvale of Gloucester, 270\nCotswold, midland district, 271\nculture difficult, 272\nin Yorkshire, 274\nimportance of, to the revenue, 275\nits chief value, from being easily converted into a saccharine substance, 281\nBeans, culture of by broad-cast, 282\nin drills, 283\n\nBeet, white, recommended, No 47\nBlack cattle, a good breed desirable, 583\nproperties requisite of, 584\nBlight, a disease of wheat, 96\nBoard of Agriculture, 8\ncommences its fittings, 9\nBogle, Mr, his mode of wheat-setting, 225\n226, 227, 228, 229\n\nBrake,\nits uses, 156\nBroom, how destroyed, 93\nBulbous foxtail grass, 394\nBurnet, 44\nrecommended, 45\ndisapproved of, 46\nculture of, 393\nButter, history of, 612\nqualities of, 613\nrules for making, 614\ncream for making, not to be new, 615\nchurn, 616\nnot to be put into water, 617\ncompositions for preserving, 618\nhow prepared for warm climates, 619\n\nButter\nButter preserved by honey, Essex or Epping, 621\nWeft of England, 622\nCambridgeshire, 623\nYorkshire and Suffolk, 624\nfrauds in the sale of, 625\nhow kept untainted by cabbages, 626\ntrade in extensive, 626\n\nButterfly, corn, 112\nBuck-wheat, culture of, 276\nadvantages of cropping, 277\n\nCabbages, their properties, render air noxious, 36\nturnip-rooted, 37\nculture of, 370\nquantity produced on an acre, 375\nof watering them, 372\ncultivated in the midland district, 373\ndistance at which they ought to be planted, 374\nhow transplanted or earthed, 375\nhow protected from caterpillars, 376\n\nCanary feed, 519\nCalves reared without milk, 585\nby Mr Young, 586\nmode of rearing in Cornwall, 587\nby Mr Crook, 588\nin Norfolk, 589\nby Mr Bradfute, 590\n\nCattle, see Black Cattle, rearing of, included under agriculture, 4\nqualities requisite for their food, 35\nare pastured, 591\nor stall-fed, 592\nstall-feeding in Germany, 593\nstall-fed in two ways, 594\nshould receive all roots in a boiled state, 595\nrules for fattening, 597\nfeeding of, not brought to perfection, 68\n\nCarrots, culture of, 40\ncultivated in Suffolk and Norfolk, 342\nwhy the culture of, not extended, 343\nsuperiority of, to turnips, 344\ndifficulty of ascertaining the value of, 345\nexperiments with, recommended, 346\nfeeding lambs with, 347\ncompared with cabbages, 349\npreferred to potatoes, 350\nsuperior to turnips and oats, 351\n\nCarrots, how used to give colour to butter, 620\ngrown in young plantations, 353\nCars of Gowrie, mode of draining in, 173\nCheese described, making, defects of, runnet for, how prepared, 628\nMr Hazard's receipt for runnet, 630\nparticulars to be observed in making, different kinds of, double Gloucester, Cheddar, Cheshire, Stilton, Parmesan, Chicory, Clover, red, of sowing with grain, white and yellow, Cyphorus cristatus, Cole-feed, see Rape-feed.

It is 50 miles in circumference, is very mountainous, and has a volcano in it; situated in N. Lat. 19. 4. E. Long. 146.\n\nAGRIGENTUM, in Ancient Geography, a city of Sicily, part of the site of which is now occupied by a town called Girgenti from the old name. See GIRGENTI.\n\nAccording to ancient authors, Dedalus, the most famous mechanician of fabulous antiquity, fled to this spot for protection against Minos, and built many wonderful edifices for Cocalus king of the island. Long after his flight, the people of Gela sent a colony hither 600 years before the birth of Christ; and from the name of a neighbouring stream called the new city Agragatis, whence the Romans formed their word Agrigentum. These Greeks converted the ancient abode of the Siculi into a citadel to guard the magnificent city which they erected on the hillocks below.\n\nAn advantageous situation, a free government with all its happy effects, and an active commercial spirit, exalted their commonwealth to a degree of riches and power unknown to the other Greek settlements, Syracuse alone excepted. But the prosperity of Agrigentum appears to have been but of short duration, and tyranny soon destroyed its liberties.\n\nPhalaris was the first who reduced it to slavery. His name is familiar to most readers on account of his cruelty, and the brazen bull in which he tortured his enemies. (See PHALARIS.)—Phalaris met with the common fate of tyrants, and after his death the Agrigentines enjoyed their liberty for 150 years; at the expiration of which term Thero usurped the sovereign authority. The moderation, justice, and valour of this prince preserved him from opposition while living, and have rescued his memory from the obloquy of posterity. He joined his son-in-law Gelo, king of Syracuse, in a war against the Carthaginians; in the course of which victory attended all his steps, and Sicily saw Agrigentum herself for a time delivered from her African oppressors. Soon after his decease, his son Thrasydeus was deprived of the diadem, and Agrigentum restored to her old democratical government. Ducetus next disturbed the general tranquillity. He was a chief of the mountaineers, descendants of the Siculi; and was an overmatch for the Agrigentines while they were unsupported by alliances, but sank under the weight of their union with the Syracusans. Some trifling alterations dissolved this union, and produced a war, in which the Agrigentines were worsted, and compelled to submit to humiliating terms of peace. Resentment led them to embrace with joy the proposals of the Athenians, then meditating an attack upon Syracuse. Their new friends soon made them feel that the sacrifice of liberty and fortune would be the price of their protection; and this consideration brought them speedily back to their old connexions. But as if it had been decreed that all friendship should be fatal to their repose, the reconciliation and its effects drew upon them the anger of the Carthaginians. By this enemy their armies were routed, their city taken, their race almost extirpated, and scarce a vestige of magnificence was left. Agrigentum lay 50 years buried under its own ruins; when Timoleon, after triumphing over the Carthaginians, and restoring liberty to Sicily, collected the descendants of the Agrigentines, and sent them to re-establish the dwellings of their forefathers. Their exertions were rewarded with astonishing success; for Agrigentum rose from its ashes with such a renewal of vigour, that in a very short time we find it engaged in the bold scheme of seizing a lucky moment, when Agathocles and Carthage had reduced Syracuse to the lowest ebb, and arrogating to itself supremacy over all the Sicilian republics. Xenodicus was appointed the leader of this arduous enterprise; and had his latter operations been as fortunate as his first campaign, Agrigentum would have acquired such a preponderance of reputation and power, that the rival states would not have even dared to attack it. But a few...\nAGRICULTURE.\n\nPlate XIII.\n\nSketch of the Wheel for raising Water at Blair Drummond.\n\nSketch of the Cistern as seen from above.\n\nHere the Buckets empty themselves.\n\nHere the arms of the Wheel move.\n\nHere the Buckets empty themselves.\n\nSketch of the manner in which the Water is filled from the Troughs into the Buckets.\nfew brilliant exploits were succeeded by a severe overthrow; the Agrigentines lost courage, disagreed in council, and humbly sued for peace to Agathocles. This commonwealth afterwards took a strong part with Pyrrhus; and when he left Sicily to the mercy of her enemies, threw itself into the arms of Carthage. During the first Punic war Agrigentum was the headquarters of the Carthaginians, and was besieged by the Roman consuls, who after eight months blockade took it by storm. It nevertheless changed matters several times during the contest between these rival states, and in every instance suffered most cruel outrages. After this period very little mention of it occurs in history, nor do we know the precise time of the destruction of the old city and the building of the new one. See Girgenti.\n\nThe principal part of the ancient city lay in the vale; the present town, called Girgenti, occupies the mountain on which the citadel of Cocalus stood.\n\nIt was difficult to be more judicious and fortunate in the choice of situation for a large city. The inhabitants were here provided with every requisite for defence, pleasure, and comfort of life; a natural wall, formed by abrupt rocks, presented a strong barrier against assailants; pleasant hills sheltered them on three sides without impeding the circulation of air; before them a broad plain, watered by the Acragas, gave admittance to the sea breeze, and to a noble prospect of that awful element; the port or emporium lay in view at the mouth of the river, and probably the road across the flat was lined with gay and populous suburbs.\n\nThe hospitality and parade for which the Agrigentines are celebrated in history were supported by an extensive commerce; by means of which, the commonwealth was able to refit many shocks of adversity, and always to rise again with fresh splendour. It was, however, crushed by the general fall of Grecian liberty; the feeble remnants of its population, which had survived so many calamities, were at length driven out of its walls by the Saracens, and obliged to lock themselves up for safety among the bleak and inaccessible rocks of the present city.\n\nAt the north-east angle of the ancient limits, upon some foundations of large regular stones, a church has been erected; a road appears hewn in the solid rock for the convenience of the votaries who visited this temple in ancient days. It was then dedicated to Ceres and her daughter Proserpine, the peculiar patronesses of Sicily.\n\nAt the south-east corner, where the ground, rising gradually, ends in a bold eminence, which is crowned with majestic columns, are the ruins of a temple said to have been consecrated to Juno. To the west of this stands the building commonly called the Temple of Concord; the stone of which, and the other buildings, is the same as that of the neighbouring mountains and cliffs, a conglomeration of sea sand and shells, full of perforations, of a hard and durable texture, and a deep reddish brown colour. This Doric temple has all its columns, entablature, pediments, and walls entire; only part of the roof is wanting. It owes its preservation to the piety of some Christians, who have covered half the nave, and converted it into a church consecrated under the invocation of St Gregory bishop of Girgenti.\n\nProceeding in the same direction, you walk between rows of sepulchres cut in the rock wherever it admitted of being excavated by the hand of man, or was so already by that of nature. Some mazes of it are hewn into the shape of coffins; others drilled full of small square holes employed in a different mode of interment, and serving as receptacles of urns. One ponderous piece of the rock lies in an extraordinary position; by the failure of its foundation, or the shock of an earthquake, it has been loosened from the general quarry, and rolled down the declivity, where it now remains supine with the cavities turned upwards. Only a single column marks the confused heap of moss-grown ruins belonging to the temple of Hercules. It stood on a projecting rock above a chasm in the ridge, which was cut through for a passage to the emporium.\n\nIn the same tract, over some hills, is situated the building usually called the Tomb of Thero. It is surrounded by aged olive trees, which cast a wild irregular shade over the ruin. The edifice inclines to the pyramidal shape, and consists at present of a triple plinth, and a base supporting a square pedestal; upon this plain solid foundation is raised a second order, having a window in each front, and at each angle two Ionic pilasters crowned with an entablature of the Doric order. Its inside is divided into a vault, a ground room, and one in the Ionic story, communicating with each other by means of a small internal staircase.\n\nIn the plain are seen the fragments of the temple of Eucleapius; part of two columns and two pilasters, with an intermediate wall, support the end of a farmhouse, and were probably the front of the cella. Pursuing the track of the walls towards the west, you arrive at a spot which is covered with the gigantic remains of the temple of the Olympian Jupiter, minutely described by Diodorus Siculus. It may literally be said that it has not one stone left upon another; and it is barely possible, with the help of much conjecture, to discover the traces of its plan and dimensions. Diodorus calls it the largest temple in the whole island; but adds, that the calamities of war caused the work to be abandoned before the roof could be put on; and that the Agrigentines were ever after reduced to such a state of poverty and dependence, that they never had it in their power to finish this superb monument of the taste and opulence of their ancestors. The length of this temple was 370 Greek feet, its breadth 60, and its height 220, exclusive of the foundations or basement story; the extent and solidity of its vaults and underworks were wonderful; its spacious porticoes and exquisite sculpture were suited to the grandeur of the whole. It was not built in the usual style of Sicilian temples with a cella of massive walls and a peristyle, but was designed in a mixed style with half columns let into the walls on the outside, the inside exhibiting a plain surface.\n\nThe next ruin belongs to the temple of Castor and Pollux; vegetation has covered the lower parts of the building, and only a few fragments of columns appear between the vines. This was the point of the hill where the wall stood on the brink of a large fish-pond spoken of by Diodorus: it was cut in the solid rock.\nAgrimony 30 feet deep, and water was conveyed to it from the hills. In it was bred a great quantity of fish for the use of public entertainments; swans and various other kinds of wild fowl swam along its surface, for the amusement of the citizens, and the great depth of water prevented an enemy from surprising the town on that side. It is now dry and used as a garden. On the opposite bank, are two tapering columns without their capitals, most happily placed in a tuft of carob trees. Monte Toro, where Hannibal encamped with the Carthaginian army, before the Roman consuls drew him into an engagement that ruined his defensive plan, is a noble back-ground to this picturesque group of objects.\n\nThe whole space comprehended within the walls of the ancient city abounds with traces of antiquity, foundations, brick-arches, and little channels for the conveyance of water; but in no part are any ruins that can be presumed to have belonged to places of public entertainment. This is the more extraordinary, as the Agrigentines were a sensual people, fond of shows and dramatic performances, and the Romans never dwelt in any place long without introducing their savage games. Theatres and amphitheatres seem better calculated than most buildings to resist the outrages of time; and it is surprising that not even the vestiges of their form should remain on the ground.\n\n**AGRIMONIA, Agrimony.** See Botany Index.\n\n**Hemp Agrimony.** See Eupatorium, Botany Index.\n\n**Water Hemp Agrimony.** See Bidens, Botany Index.\n\n**AGRIONIA,** in Grecian Antiquity, festivals annually celebrated by the Boeotians in honour of Bacchus. At these festivals, the women pretended to search after Bacchus as a fugitive; and, after some time, gave over their inquiry, saying, that he had fled to the Muses, and was concealed among them.\n\n**AGRIOPHAGI,** in Antiquity, a name given to those who fed on wild beasts. The word is Greek, compounded of ἀγελος, \"wild,\" \"savage,\" and φαγων, \"I eat.\" The name is given, by ancient writers, to certain people, real or fabulous, said to have fed altogether on lions or panthers. Pliny and Solinus speak of Agriophagi in Ethiopia, and Ptolemy of others in India on this side the Ganges.\n\n**AGRIPPA, Cornelius,** born at Cologne in 1486, a man of considerable learning, and by common report a great magician; for the monks at that time suspected every thing of heresy or sorcery which they did not understand. He composed his *Treatise of the Excellence of Women,* to intimate himself into the favour of Margaret of Austria, governess of the Low-Countries. He accepted of the charge of historiographer to the emperor, which that princess gave him. The treatise of the *Vanity of the Sciences,* which he published in 1530, enraged his enemies extremely; as did that of *Occult Philosophy,* which he printed soon after at Antwerp. He was imprisoned in France for something he had written against Francis I.'s mother; but was enlarged, and went to Grenoble, where he died in 1534. His works are printed in two volumes octavo.\n\n**AGRIPPA, Herod,** the son of Aristobulus and Mariamne, and grandson to Herod the Great, was born in the year of the world 3997, three years before the birth of our Saviour, and seven years before the vulgar era. After the death of Aristobulus, his father, Josephus informs us, that Herod his grandfather took care of his education, and sent him to Rome to make his court to Tiberius. The emperor conceived a great affection for Agrippa, and placed him near his son Drusus. Agrippa very soon won the graces of Drusus, and of the empress Antonia. But Drusus dying suddenly, all those who had been much about him were commanded by Tiberius to withdraw from Rome, lest the sight and presence of them should renew his affliction. Agrippa, who had indulged his inclination to liberality, was obliged to leave Rome overwhelmed with debts, and in a very poor condition. He did not think it fit to go to Jerusalem, because he was not able to make a figure there suitable to his birth. He retired therefore to the castle of Massada, where he lived rather like a private person than a prince. Herod the Tetrarch, his uncle, who had married Herodias his sister, afflicted him for some time with great generosity. He made him principal magistrate of Tiberias, and presented him with a large sum of money; but all this was not sufficient to answer the excessive expenses and profusion of Agrippa; so that Herod growing weary of afflicting him, and reproaching him with his bad economy, Agrippa took a resolution to quit Judea, and return to Rome. Upon his arrival, he was received into the good graces of Tiberius, and commanded to attend Tiberius Nero the son of Drusus. Agrippa, however, having more inclination for Caius the son of Germanicus, and grandson of Antonia, chose rather to attach himself to him; as if he had some prophetic views of the future elevation of Caius, who at that time was beloved by all the world. The great affluence and agreeable behaviour of Agrippa so far engaged this prince, that he kept him continually about him.\n\nAgrippa being one day overheard by Eutyches, a slave whom he had made free, to express his wishes for Tiberius's death and the advancement of Caius, the slave betrayed him to the emperor; whereupon Agrippa was loaded with fetters, and committed to the custody of an officer. Tiberius soon after dying, and Caius Caligula succeeding him, the new emperor heaped many favours and much wealth upon Agrippa; changed his iron fetters into a chain of gold; set a royal diadem upon his head; and gave him the tetrarchy which Philip, the son of Herod the Great, had been possessed of, that is, Batanaea and Trachonitis. To this he added that of Lybanias; and Agrippa returned very soon into Judea to take possession of his new kingdom.\n\nCaius being soon after killed, Agrippa, who was then at Rome, contributed much by his advice to maintain Claudius in possession of the imperial dignity, to which he had been advanced by the army. But in this affair Agrippa acted a part wherein he showed more cunning and address than sincerity and honesty; for while he made a show of being in the interest of the senate, he secretly advised Claudius to be resolute, and not to abandon his good fortune. The emperor, as an acknowledgment for his kind offices, gave him all Judea and the kingdom of Chalcis, which had been possessed by Herod his brother. Thus Agrippa became of a sudden one of the greatest princes of the east; and was possessed of as much, if not more territories\nAgrippa, ritories than had been held by Herod the Great his grandfather. He returned to Judea, and governed it to the great satisfaction of the Jews. But the desire of pleasing them, and a mistaken zeal for their religion, induced him to commit an unjust action; the memory of which is preserved in Scripture, Acts xii. 1, 2, &c., for about the feast of the passover, in the year of Jesus Christ 44, St James major, the son of Zebedee and brother of St John the Evangelist, was seized by his order and put to death. He proceeded also to lay hands on St Peter, and imprisoned him, waiting till the festival was over, that he might then have him executed. But God having miraculously delivered St Peter from the place of his confinement, the designs of Agrippa were frustrated. After the passover, this prince went from Jerusalem to Caesarea, and there had games performed in honour of Claudius. Here the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon waited on him to sue for peace. Agrippa being come early in the morning to the theatre, with a design to give them audience, seated himself on his throne, dressed in a robe of silver-tissue, worked in the most admirable manner. The rising sun darted on it with its rays, and gave it such a lustre as the eyes of the spectators could not endure. When therefore the king spoke to the Tyrians and Sidonians, the parasites around him began to say, that it was the voice of a god, and not that of a man. Instead of rejecting these impious flatteries, Agrippa received them with an air of complacency; but at the same time observed an owl above him on a cord. He had seen the same bird before when he was in bonds by order of Tiberius; and it was then told him, that he should be soon set at liberty: but that whenever he saw the same thing a second time, he should not live above five days afterwards. He was therefore extremely terrified; and he died at the end of five days, racked with tormenting pains in his bowels, and devoured with worms. Such was the death of Herod Agrippa, after a reign of seven years, in the year of Christ 44.\n\nAgrippa II., son of the preceding Herod, was made king of Chalcis; but three or four years after, he was deprived of that kingdom by Claudius, who gave him in the place of it other provinces. In the war Vespasian carried on against the Jews, Herod lent him a succour of 2000 men; by which it appears that though a Jew by religion, he was yet entirely devoted to the Romans, whose affiance indeed he wanted to secure the peace of his own kingdom. He lived to the third year of Trajan, and died at Rome A.D. 100. He was the seventh and last king of the family of Herod the Great. It was before him and Berenice his sister that St Paul pleaded his cause at Caesarea.\n\nAgrippa, Marcus Vitianus, son-in-law to Augustus, of mean birth, but one of the most considerable generals among the Romans. Augustus's victory over Pompey and Mark Antony was owing to his counsel. He adorned the city with the pantheon, baths, aqueducts, &c.\n\nAgrippina, daughter of Germanicus, sister of Caligula, and mother of Nero; a woman of wit, but excessively lewd. She was thrice married, the last time to Claudius her own uncle, whom she poisoned to make way for Nero her son. Nero afterwards caused her to be murdered in her chamber, when she bid the executioner stab her first in the belly that had brought forth Agrippina such a monster.\n\nAgrippina Colonia Ubiorum, in Ancient Geography, now Cologne: so called from Agrippina, the daughter of Germanicus, and mother of Nero, who had a colony sent thither at her request by the emperor Claudius, to honour the place of her birth. See Cologne.\n\nAgrippinians, in Church History, the followers of Agrippinus bishop of Carthage, in the third century, who first introduced and defended the practice of re-baptization.\n\nAgrom, a disease frequent in Bengal and other parts of the Indies, in which the tongue is parched, chaps, and is sometimes covered with white spots. The Indians are very fearful of this disease, which they attribute to extreme heat of the stomach. Their remedy is, to drink some chalybeate liquor, or the juice of mint.\n\nAgrostemma, Wild Lychinis, or Campion, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAgrostis, Bent-grass, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAgrostographia, signifies the history or description of grasses.\n\nAground, the situation of a ship whose bottom, or any part of it, hangs, or rests upon the ground, so as to render her immovable, till a greater quantity of water floats her off, or till she is drawn out into the stream by the application of mechanical powers.\n\nAgrypnia, among Physicians, implies an inability to sleep; a troublesome symptom of feverish and other disorders.\n\nAgrypnia, in the Greek Church, implies the vigil of any of the greater festivals.\n\nague, a general name for all periodical fevers, which, according to the different times of the returns of the feverish paroxysm, are denominated tertian, quartan, and quotidian. See Medicine Index.\n\nague-Cake, the popular name for a hard tumour on the left side of the belly, lower than the false ribs, said to be the effect of intermittent fevers.\n\nague-Tree, a name given to the saffraan, on account of its fugitive qualities.\n\nAgueperse, a town of France, situated on the Loire, in the department of Puy-de-Dome, about 15 miles north of Clermont.\n\naguillaneuf, or Augillaneuf, a form of rejoicing used among the ancient Franks on the first day of the year. The word is compounded of the French \"a\" \"to,\" \"gui\" \"milleto,\" and \"l'an neuf\" \"the new year.\" Its origin is traced from a druid ceremony: the priests used to go yearly in December, which with them was reputed a sacred month, to gather millet of the oak in great solemnity. The prophets marched in the front, singing hymns in honour of their deities; after them came a herald with a caduceus in his hand; these were followed by three druids abreast, bearing the things necessary for sacrifice; last of all came the chief or arch druid, accompanied with the train of people. The chief druid climbing the oak, cut off the millet with a golden sickle, and the other druids received it in a white cloth; on the first day of the year it was distributed among the people, after having been blessed and consecrated it by crying \"Gui l'an neuf,\" to proclaim...\nproclaim the new year. This cry is still continued in Picardy, with the addition of Plantez, Plantez, to with a plentiful year. In Burgundy and some other parts, the children use the same word to beg a new-year's gift. In latter times the name Aguillaneuf was also given to a sort of begging, practised in some dioceses, for church-tapers, on new year's day, by a troop of young people of both sexes, having a chief, &c. It was attended with various ridiculous ceremonies, as dancing in the church, &c., which occasioned the synods to suppress it.\n\nAGUILAR, a town of Spain, in the province of Navarre, about 24 miles west of Estella.\n\nAGUILAR del Campo, a town of Old Castile, with the title of marquisate, about 15 leagues north of the city of Burgos.\n\nAGUILLON, or Aguillonius, Francis, a Jesuit, born at Bruges; he was rector of the Jesuits' college at Antwerp, and eminent for his skill in mathematics. He was the first who introduced that science among the Jesuits in the Low Countries; he wrote a book of Optics, and was employed in finishing his Coptics and Dioptrics, when he died in 1617.\n\nAGUIRRA, Joseph Sandoval, a Benedictine, and one of the most learned men of the 17th century, was born March 24, 1630. He was censor and secretary of the supreme council of the inquisition in Spain, and interpreter of the Scriptures in the university of Salamanca. He printed three volumes in folio upon Philosophy, a commentary upon Aristotle's ten books of Ethics, and other pieces. He died at Rome in 1699.\n\nAGUL, in Botany, a synonyme of the hedyotum. See Hedysarum, Botany Index.\n\nAGUR. The xxxth chapter of the Proverbs begins with this title: \"The words of Agur, the son of Jakob,\" which, according to the signification of the original terms, may be translated, as the Vulgate has it, Verba congregantis, filii vomentis; which translation Le Clerc condemns, supposing these to be proper names which ought not to be translated. These words are rendered by Louis de Dieu: \"the words of him who has recollected himself, the son of obedience.\" The generality of the fathers and commentators will have it, that Solomon describes himself under the name of Agur the son of Jakob; others conjecture that Agur, as well as Lemuel (in chap. xxxi. 1.) were wise men who lived in the time of Solomon, and were his interlocutors in the book of Proverbs; an opinion which F. Calmet thinks is without the least show of probability, this book being nothing like a dialogue. This last expositor thinks it probable, that Agur was an inspired author different from Solomon, whose sentences it was thought fit to join with those of this prince, because of the conformity of their matter.\n\nAGURAH, in Jewish Antiquity, the name of a silver coin, otherwise called gerah and kephira.\n\nAGURIUM, or Agrium, in Ancient Geography, a town of Sicily in the Val di Demona, near the river Semetus. The people were called Populus Agryniensis by Cicero; Agrynius by Pliny. It was the birth-place of Diodorus Siculus, as he himself testifies; but he calls it Argyrion, as it is now called S. Philippo d'Argyron, which modern name seems to confirm that Argyrium is the true reading.\n\nAGUSADURA, in Ancient Customs, a fee due from Agudura vassals to their lord for the sharpening their ploughing tackle. Anciently the tenants in some manors were not allowed to have their rural implements sharpened by any but whom the lord appointed; for which an acknowledgment was to be paid, called agu sadura, in some places agylage: which some take to be the same with what was otherwise called reillage, from the ancient French reille, a ploughshare.\n\nAGUSTINA, a new earth; which, as the word signifies, is taffelis, insoluble in water, and when pure resembles alumina. It was discovered in the year 1800 by Trommldorff in the Saxon beryl. But as his experiments have not been repeated, the existence of this earth rests solely on his authority.\n\nAGUTI, in Zoology, the trivial name of a species of the mouse, belonging to the mammalia glires of Linnaeus.\n\nAGYEL, in Antiquity, a kind of obelisks, sacred to Apollo, erected in the vestibules of houses, by way of security.\n\nAGYNEIA, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAGYNANI, in Church History, a sect who condemned all use of flesh, and marriage, as not instituted by God, but introduced at the instigation of the devil. The word is compounded of the privative a and yon woman. They are sometimes also called Agynenae, and Agynei: and are said to have appeared about the year 694. It is no wonder they were of no long continuance. Their tenets coincide in a great measure with those of the Abelians, Gnostics, Cerdonians, and other preachers of chastity and abstinence.\n\nAGYRTÉ, in Antiquity, a kind of strolling impostors running about the country, to pick up money, by telling fortunes at rich men's doors, pretending to cure diseases by charms, sacrifices, and other religious mysteries; also to expiate the crimes of their deceased ancestors, by virtue of certain odours and fumigations; to torment their enemies, by the use of magical verses, and the like. The word is Greek Agorai, formed of the verb aγορα, I congregate; alluding to the practice of charlatans or quacks, who gather a crowd about them.\n\nAgyrta, among the Greeks, amount to the same with Euryctores among the Latins, and differ not much from Gypsies among us.\n\nAHAB, son of Omri king of Israel, succeeded his father A. M. 3086, and surpassed all his predecessors in impiety and wickedness. He married Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, who introduced the idols of Baal and Ashtoreth among the Israelites, and engaged Ahab in the worship of these false deities. God, being provoked by the sins of Ahab, sent the prophet Elijah to him (1 Kings xvii. 1. seq.), who declared to him, that there would be a famine of three years continuance. The dearth having lasted three years, the prophet desired Ahab to gather all the people to Mount Carmel, and with them the prophets of Baal: when they were thus assembled, Elijah caused fire to descend from heaven upon his sacrifice, after which he obtained of God that it should rain; and then the earth recovered its former fertility. Six years after this, Ben-hadad king of Syria (chap. xx.) laid siege to Jerusalem. But God, provoked at this proud Syrian, sent a prophet to Ahab, not only\nAhab, to assure him of victory, but to instruct him likewise in what manner he was to obtain it. Ahab was ordered to review the princes of the provinces, which he found to be a choice company, consisting of 232 young men, who were to command the people in Samaria, amounting to about 7000 men; with this small army Ahab was directed to fall upon the great host of the Syrians, and that at noon-day, while Ben-hadad and the 32 kings that accompanied him were drinking and making merry. Ben-hadad having notice that they were marching out of the city, ordered them to be brought before him alive, whatever their designs were; but the young men, followed by this small army, advanced, and killed all that opposed them. Such a panic seized the Syrian troops, that they began to fly, and even Ben-hadad himself mounted his horse and fled with his cavalry: which Ahab perceiving, pursued them, killed great numbers of them, and took a considerable booty. After this the prophet came to Ahab, to animate him with fresh courage, and to caution him to keep up his guard; assuring him, that Ben-hadad would return against him the year following. According to this prediction, at the end of the year he returned and encamped at Aphek, with a resolution to give the Israelites battle. Both armies being ranged in order of battle for seven days successively, at length upon the seventh day, a battle ensued, wherein the Israelites killed 100,000 of the Syrians, and the rest fled to Aphek; but as they were pressing to get into the city, the walls of Aphek fell upon them and killed 27,000 more. Ben-hadad throwing himself upon the mercy of Ahab, this prince received him into his own chariot, and made an alliance with him. The year following, Ahab desiring to make a kitchen garden near his palace (chap. xxii.), requested of one Naboth, a citizen of Jezreel, that he would sell him his vineyard, because it lay convenient for him. But being refused, he returned in great discontentment to his house, threw himself upon the bed, turned towards the wall, and would eat nothing. Jezebel his wife coming in, asked the reason of his great concern; of which being informed, she procured the death of Naboth, and Ahab took possession of his vineyard. As he returned from Jezreel to Samaria, the prophet Elijah met him, and said, \"Hast thou killed and also taken possession? Now faith the Lord, In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. As for Jezebel, of her the Lord spoke, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the way of Jezreel.\" Ahab, hearing these and other denunciations, rent his clothes, put sackcloth upon his flesh, and gave other indications of his sorrow and repentance. But his repentance was neither sincere nor persevering. Two years after these things, Jehoshaphat king of Judah came to Samaria to visit Ahab (chap. xxiii.) at a time when he was preparing to attack Ramoth-gilead, which Ben-hadad king of Syria unjustly withheld from him. The king of Israel invited Jehoshaphat to accompany him in this expedition; which that prince agreed to do, but desired that some prophet might first be consulted. Ahab therefore assembled the prophets of Baal, in number about 400; who all concurred in exhorting the king to march resolutely against Ramoth-gilead. But Micaiah being also consulted, at Jehoshaphat's suggestion, prophesied the ruin of Ahab. Upon this, Ahab gave orders to his people to seize Micaiah, and to carry him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; telling him in his name, \"Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with the bread of affliction, and with the water of affliction, until I come in peace.\" But Micaiah said, \"If thou return at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken by me.\" Ahab, therefore, and Jehoshaphat marched up to Ramoth-gilead; and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \"I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle, but put thou on my robe:\" for he knew that the king of Syria had commanded two and thirty captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, \"Fight neither with small nor with great, save only with the king of Israel.\" These officers, therefore, having observed that Jehoshaphat was dressed in royal robes, took him for the king of Israel, and fell upon him with great impetuosity: but this prince seeing himself pressed closely, cried out; and the mistake being discovered, the captains of the king of Syria gave over pursuing him. But one of the Syrian army shot a random arrow, which pierced the heart of Ahab. The battle lasted the whole day, and Ahab continued in his chariot with his face turned towards the Syrians. In the mean time, his blood was still issuing from his wound, and falling in his chariot; and towards the evening he died: whereupon proclamation was made by sound of trumpet, that every man should return to his own city and country. The king of Israel being dead, was carried to Samaria and buried: but his chariot and the reins of his horses were washed in the fountain of Samaria, and the dogs licked his blood, according to the word of the prophet. Such was the end of Ahab. His son Ahaziah succeeded him in the year of the world 3167.\n\nAHÆTULA, the trivial name of a species of the coluber. See Coluber.\n\nAHASUERUS, or Artaxerxes, the husband of Esther; and according to Archbishop Usher and F. Calmet, the Scripture name for Darius, the son of Hystaspes, king of Persia; though Scaliger supposed Xerxes to have been the husband of Esther, or the Ahasuerus of Scripture: and Dr Prideaux believes him to be Artaxerxes Longimanus. See History of Persia.\n\nAHAZ, king of Judah, the son of Jotham, remarkable for his vices and impieties. One of his sons he consecrated, by making him pass through and perish by the fire, in honour of the false god Moloch; and he offered sacrifices and incense upon the high places, upon hills, and in groves. Rezin king of Syria and Pekah king of Israel invaded Judea in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz; and having defeated his army and pillaged the country, they laid siege to Jerusalem. When they found that they could not make themselves masters of that city, they divided their army, plundered the country, and made the inhabitants prisoners of war. Rezin and his part of the confederate army marched with all their spoil to Damascus; but Pekah with his division of the army having attacked Ahaz, killed 120,000 men of his army in one battle, and carried away men, women, and children, without distinction, to the number of 200,000. But as they were carrying those captives to Samaria, the prophet Oded, with the principal inhabitants of the city, came out to meet...\nmeet them; and by their remonstrances prevailed with them to set their prisoners at liberty. At the same time, the Philistines and Edomites invaded other parts of his land, killed multitudes of the people, and carried off much booty. In this distressed condition, Ahaz finding no other remedy for his affairs, sent ambassadors to Tiglath-pileser king of the Assyrians; and to engage him to his interest, he stripped the temple and city of all the gold which he could meet with, and sent it as a present. Accordingly Tiglath-pileser marched to the assistance of Ahaz, attacked Rezin and killed him, took his capital Damascus, destroyed it, and removed the inhabitants thereof to Cyrene.\n\nThe misfortunes of this prince had no influence to make him better: on the contrary, in the times of his greatest affliction, he sacrificed to the Syrian deities, whom he looked upon as the authors of his calamities, and endeavoured to render propitious to him, by honouring them in this manner. He broke in pieces the vessels of the house of God, shut up the gates of the temple, and erected altars in all parts of Jerusalem. He set up altars likewise in all the cities of Judah, with a design to offer incense on them. At length he died, and was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the sepulchres of the kings of Judah his predecessors: which honour he was deprived of, on account of his injurious course of life. Hezekiah his son succeeded him in the year of the world 3287, before Jesus Christ 726.\n\nAHAZIAH, the son and successor of Ahab king of Israel, reigned two years, part alone and part with his father Ahab, who ordained him his associate in the kingdom a year before his death. Ahaziah imitated his father's impieties (1 Kings xxii. 52, seq.), and paid his adoration to Baal and Asherah, the worship of whom had been introduced in Israel by Jezebel his mother. The Moabites, who had been always obedient to the kings of the ten tribes ever since their separation from the kingdom of Judah, revolted after the death of Ahab, and refused to pay the ordinary tribute. Ahaziah had not leisure or power to reduce them (2 Kings i. 1, 2, &c.); for about the same time, having fallen through a lattice from the top of his house, he hurt himself considerably, and sent messengers to Ekron, in order to consult Baalzebub, the god of that place, whether he should recover of the indisposition occasioned by this accident. But the prophet Elijah went to Ahaziah, and declared that he should not recover from his illness: and accordingly he died in the year of the world 3108, and Jehoram his brother succeeded to the crown.\n\nAHAZIAH, king of Judah, the son of Jehoram and Athaliah, succeeded his father in the kingdom of Judah, in the year of the world 3110. He walked in the ways of Ahab's house, to which he was allied. He reigned only one year. He was slain by Jehu the son of Nimshi.\n\nAHHEAD, a sea term, signifying further onward than the ship, or at any distance before her, lying immediately on that point of the compass to which her stem is directed. It is used in opposition to aftern, which expresses the situation of any object behind the ship.\n\nAHIJAH, the prophet of Shilo. He is thought to be the person who spoke twice to Solomon from God, once while he was building the temple (1 Kings vi. 11.), at which time he promised his protection; and at another time (id. xi. 6.) after his falling into all his irregularities, when God expressed his indignation with great threatenings and reproaches. Ahijah was one of those who wrote the annals or history of this prince (2 Chr. ix. 29.) The same prophet declared to Jeroboam that he would usurp the kingdom (1 Kings xi. 29, &c.), and that two heifers should alienate him from the Lord, meaning the golden calves erected by Jeroboam, one at Dan, the other at Bethel. About the end of Jeroboam's reign, towards the year of the world 3246, Abijah the son of that prince fell sick; upon which Jeroboam sent his wife to this prophet to inquire what would become of the child. The queen therefore went to Abijah's house in Shiloh, disguised: But the prophet, upon hearing the sound of her feet, said, \"Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam, why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.\" Then he commanded her to go and tell Jeroboam all the evil that the Lord had declared he would bring upon his house for his impurities; that so soon as she should enter into the city her son Abijah should die, and should be the only one of Jeroboam's house that should come to the grave or receive the honours of a burial. Abijah in all probability did not long survive the time of this last prophecy; but with the time and manner of his death we are not acquainted.\n\nAHITOPHEL, a native of Gilo, was for some time the counsellor of King David, whom he at length deserted, by joining in the rebellion of Absalom. This prince, upon his being preferred to the crown by the greatest part of the Israelites, sent for Ahitophel from Gilo (2 Sam. xv. 12.) to assist him with his advice in the present state of his affairs: for at that time Ahitophel's counsels were received as the oracles of God himself (chap. xvi. u.l.) Nothing gave David more uneasiness than this event; and when Hushai his friend came to wait on him and attend him in his flight, he intreated him to return rather to Jerusalem, make a show of offering his services to Absalom, and endeavour to frustrate the prudent measures which should be proposed by Ahitophel. When Absalom was come to Jerusalem, he desired Ahitophel to deliberate with his other counsellors upon the measures which were proper for him to take. Ahitophel advised him in the first place to abuse his father's concubines; so that when his party should understand that he had dishonoured his father in this manner, they might conclude that there were no hopes of a reconciliation, and therefore espouse his interest more resolutely. A tent, therefore, being prepared for this purpose upon the terrace of the king's palace, Absalom, in the sight of all Israel, lay with his father's concubines. The next thing Ahitophel proposed was in the terms following: \"Let me now choose out 12,000 men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night, and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed, and I will make him afraid, and all the people that are with him flee, and I will smite the king only; and I will bring back all the people unto thee; the man whom thou keepest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.\" This advice was very agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel. However,\nAbihas desired Hushai to be called to have his opinion. Hushai being come, and hearing what advice Ahithophel had given, said, \"The counsel which Ahithophel has given is not good at this time; what, for the present, in my opinion, may do better, is this: Let all Israel be gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and put thyself in the midst of them, and wherever David is, we may fall upon him, and overwhelm him with our numbers, as the dew falleth upon the ground.\" This last advice being more agreeable to Absalom and all the elders of Israel, was preferred; upon which Ahithophel saddled his ass, went to his house at Gilo, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. He foresaw, without doubt, all that would happen in consequence of Hushai's advice, and was determined to prevent the death which he had deserved, and which David would probably have inflicted on him, as soon as he should be resettled on his throne.\n\nAHMELLA, in Botany. See Bidens, Botany Index.\n\nAHOLIBAH and Aholah, are two feigned names made use of by Ezekiel (xxiii. 4.) to denote the two kingdoms of Judah and Samaria. Aholah and Aholibah are represented as two sisters of Egyptian extraction. Aholah stands for Samaria, and Aholibah for Jerusalem. The first signifies a tent; and the second, my tent is in her. They both profited themselves to the Egyptians and Assyrians, in imitating their abominations and idolatries; for which reason they were abandoned to those very people for whom they had thrown so passionate, and so impure an affection; they were carried into captivity, and reduced to the severest servitude.\n\nAHULLI, in the sea-language, the situation of a ship when all her sails are furled on account of the violence of the storm, and when having lashed her helm on the lee-side, she lies nearly with her side to the wind and sea, her head being somewhat inclined to the direction of the wind.\n\nAHUN, a town in France, in the Upper Marche and generality of Moulins, in the department of Creuse. It is seated on the river Creuse, eight miles south-east of Gueret, 30 north-east of Lomages, and 35 south-east of Moulins. E. Long. 1. 52. N. Lat. 49. 5.\n\nAHUYS, a town of Gothland in Sweden. It is small, but very strong by its situation, and has a good port. It is in the principality of Gothland, in the territory of Bleckingy, near the Baltic sea, about 18 miles from Christianstadt. E. Long. 14. 10. N. Lat. 56. 20.\n\nAI, in Ancient Geography, a town in Judea, to the north of Jericho, called Ama by Josephus, and the inhabitants Ainat. Joshua having sent a detachment of 3000 men against Ai, God permitted them to be repulsed on account of Achan's sin, who had violated the anathema pronounced against the city of Jericho. But after the expiation of this offence, God commanded Joshua (chap. viii.) to march with the whole army of the Israelites against Ai, and treat this city and the kingdom thereof as he had treated Jericho, with this difference, that he gave the plunder of the town to the people. Joshua sent by night 30,000 men to lie in ambush behind Ai; having first well instructed those who had the command of them in what they were to do; and the next day, early in the morning, he marched against the city with the remainder of his army. The king of Ai, perceiving them, fell hastily out of the town with all his people, and fell upon the forces of the Israelites, who, upon the first onset, fled, as if they had been under some great terror.\n\nAs soon as Joshua saw the enemy all out of the gates, he raised his shield upon the top of a pike, which was the signal given to the ambuscade; whereupon they immediately entered the place, which they found without defence, and set fire to it. The people of Ai perceiving the smoke ascending, were willing to return, but discovered those who had set fire to the city in their rear, while Joshua and those who were with him turning about, fell upon them, and cut them in pieces. The king was taken alive, and afterwards put to death.\n\nThe chevalier Folard observes, that Joshua's enterprise on Ai, excepting in some particulars of military art, is very like that of Gibeah, which is scarce anything more than a copy of it. It would appear, says that writer, by the Scripture account, that Joshua was not the author of the stratagem made use of by him: for when God directs himself to Joshua, he says, \"Go up against Ai; lay an ambuscade behind the town; I have delivered the king and the people of it into thine hands;\" yet notwithstanding this, God might leave the whole glory of the invention and execution of it to him, as to a great general. \"Joshua arose, (says the sacred author,) and all the people of war, to go up against Ai (verse 3.) and Joshua chose out 30,000 mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night,\" Folard remarks, that there is a manifest contradiction between this verse and the 14th, wherein it is said, that Joshua chose out 500 men, whom he sent to lie in ambush, between Bethel and Ai. How is this to be reconciled? Calmet says, that Malus allows but 5000 men for the ambuscade, and 25,000 for the attack of the city, being persuaded that an army of 600,000 men could only create confusion on this occasion, without any necessity for, or advantage in, such numbers; but the generality of interpreters, continues Calmet, acknowledge two bodies to be placed in ambuscade, both between Bethel and Ai; one of 25,000, and the other of 5000 men.\n\nWith regard to the signal Joshua made to that part of his army which lay in ambuscade, the learned Folard embraces the opinion of the Rabbins, who believe what is called the shield to be too small to serve for a signal: hence they make it to be the staff of one of their colours: from this, our author concludes, that the whole colours were used on this occasion; for in the Asiatic style, which is very near the poetical, the part is oftentimes to be taken for the whole.\n\nAJALON, in Ancient Geography, a town of the tribe of Dan, one of the Levitical. Another in the tribe of Benjamin, in whose valley Joshua commanded the moon to stand still, being then in her decrease, and consequently to be seen at the same time with the sun. AJAN, a coast and country of Africa, has the river Quilimani on the south; the mountains from which that river springs, on the west; Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, and the strait of Babelmandel, on the north; and the Eastern, or Indian ocean, on the east.\ncoast abounds with all necessaries of life, and has plenty of very good horses. The kings of Ajan are often at war with the emperor of the Abyssins; and all the prisoners they take sell to the merchants of Cambaya, those of Aden, and other Arabs, who come to trade in their harbours, and give them in exchange, coloured cloths, glass-beads, raisins, and dates; for which they also take back, besides slaves, gold and ivory. The whole sea coast, from Zanguebar to the strait of Babel-mandel, is called the coast of Ajan; and a considerable part of it is styled the Desert coast.\n\nAJAX, the son of Oileus, was one of the principal generals who went to the siege of Troy. He ravished Cassandra the daughter of Priam, even in the temple of Minerva, where she thought to have found sanctuary. It is said, he made a serpent of 15 feet long so familiar with him, that it ate at his table, and followed him like a dog. The Locrians had a singular veneration for his memory.\n\nAJAX, the son of Telamon, was, next to Achilles, the most valiant general among the Greeks at the siege of Troy. He commanded the troops of Salamis, and performed many great actions, of which we have an account in the Iliad, in Diodorus Cretensis, and in the 23rd book of Ovid's metamorphoses. He was so enraged that the arms of Achilles were adjudged to Ulysses, that he immediately became mad. The Greeks paid great honours to him after his death, and erected a magnificent monument to his memory upon the promontory of Rhetium.\n\nAJAX, in Antiquity, a furious kind of dance, in use among the Grecians; intended to represent the madness of that hero after his defeat by Ulysses, to whom the Greeks had given the preference in his contest for Achilles's arms. Lucian, in his treatise of Dancing, speaks of dancing the Ajax.—There was also an annual feast called Ajantia, Auxilia, consecrated to that prince, and observed with great solemnity in the island of Salamis, as well as in Attica: where, in memory of the valour of Ajax, a bier was exposed, set out with a complete set of armour.\n\nAJAZZO, a sea-port of the island of Corsica, in the Mediterranean, with a bishop's see. It is situated in a fertile territory, which produces excellent wines. It has a small citadel; the streets are spacious, the houses well built, and the walks agreeable. The number of inhabitants is computed about 4000; many of them are Greeks. The trade of Ajazzo consists of timber, and black, red, and white coral; in the fishery of which the inhabitants are employed. E. Long. 8° 50'.\nN. Lat. 41° 50'.\n\nAJAZZO, a sea-port town of Natolia, in the province of Caramania, anciently Cilicia, seated on the coast of the Mediterranean, 30 miles north of Antioch and 50 west of Aleppo, where the city of Ilius anciently stood, and near which Alexander fought his second battle with Darius. E. Long. 33° 10'. N. Lat. 37° 0'.\n\nAICHSTATT, a town of Germany, in Franconia, and capital of a bishopric of the same name. It is remarkable for a curious piece of workmanship, called the Sun of the Holy Sacrament, which is in the church. It is of maffy gold, of great weight; and is enriched with 350 diamonds, 1400 pearls, 250 rubies, and other precious stones. This place is moderately large, and seated in a valley on the river Altmul, 10 miles north of Nieuburg, and 37 south of Nuremberg. E. Long. 11° 10'. N. Lat. 49° 0'. The bishopric is 45 miles in length and 17 in breadth; and the bishop is chancellor of the church of Mayence or Mentz.\n\nAID, in a general sense, denotes any kind of assistance given by one person to another.\n\nAID, in Law, denotes a petition made in court to call in help from another person who has interest in land, or anything contested.\n\nAid-de-Camp, in Military Affairs, an officer employed to receive and carry the orders of a general.\n\nAID, Auxilium, in Ancient Customs, a subsidy paid by valets to their lords on certain occasions. Such were the aid of relief, paid upon the death of the lord's eldest son; the aid cheval, or capital aid, due to the chief lord on several occasions, as, to make his eldest son a knight, to make up a portion for marrying his daughter, &c.\n\nALDS, in the French Customs, were certain duties paid on all goods exported or imported into that kingdom.\n\nCourts of Aids, in France, a sovereign court formerly established in several cities, which had cognizance of all causes relating to the taxes, gabelles, and aids, imposed on several sorts of commodities, especially wine.\n\nARMS, in the Manege, are the same with what some writers call cherishing; and used to avoid the necessity of corrections.—The inner heel, inner leg, inner rein, &c. are called inner aids; as the outer heel, outer leg, outer rein, &c. are called outer aids.\n\nAIDAN, a famous Scottish bishop of Lindisfarne, or Holy Island, in the 7th century, was employed by Oswald king of Northumberland in the conversion of the English, in which he was very successful. He was a monk in the monastery of Jona, one of the Hebrides. He died in 651.\n\nAIGHENDALE, the name of a liquid measure used in Lancashire, containing seven quarts.\n\nAIGLE, a bailiwick in the territory of Romand in Switzerland, consisting of mountains and valleys, the principal of which are the Aigle and Bex. Through these is the great road from Valais into Italy. When you pass by Villeneuve, which is at the head of the lake of Geneva, you enter into a deep valley three miles wide, bordered on one side with the Alps of Switzerland, and on the other side with those of Savoy, and crossed by the river Rhone. Six miles from thence you meet with Aigle, a large town, seated in a wide part of the valley, where there are vineyards, fields, and meadows. The governor's castle is on an eminence that overlooks the town, and has a lofty marble tower. This government has nine large parishes; and is divided into four parts, Aigle, Bex, Olon, and Ormont. This last is among the mountains, and joins to Rougemont. It is a double valley, abounding in pasture-lands. Ivorna, in the district of Aigle, was in part buried by the fall of a mountain, occasioned by an earthquake in 1584.\n\nAIGLE, a small town in France, in Upper Normandy, 23 miles from D'Exereux, and 38 from Rouen, in the department of Orne.

He was the son of William Aikman Esq. of Cairney, and was intended by his father to follow his own profession, which was that of an advocate at the Scotch bar. But the genius of the son led him to other studies. He devoted himself to the fine arts, especially that of painting, and having for some time prosecuted his studies in Britain, in the year 1707 he went to Italy, resided in Rome for three years, afterwards travelled to Constantinople and Smyrna, and in 1712 returned to his own country. About the year 1723 he fixed his residence in London, where he followed the profession of painting, and had the good fortune to be patronised by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Burlington, Sir Godfrey Kneller, and other liberal encouragers of the arts. He painted many portraits of persons of the first rank in England and Scotland; and a large picture of the royal family for the earl of Burlington, now in the possession of the duke of Devonshire, which was unfinished at his death. Some of his portraits painted in Scotland are in the possession of the duke of Argyle, the duke of Hamilton and others. Mr Aikman died in London, June 4. 1731. Six months previous to his death he had lost a son at the age of 17. The remains of both were removed to Edinburgh, and were interred in the Greyfriars churchyard on the same day. Mr Somerville the author of the Chase, Mr Mallet, Mr Allan Ramsay the Scottish poet, and Mr Thomson, were among Mr Aikman's intimate acquaintances; and the muse of each, in elegiac numbers, offered a warm tribute to the memory of their departed friend. The following epitaph from the pen of Mr Mallet, was engraved on his tomb:\n\nDear to the good and wise, disprais'd by none,\nHere sleep in peace the father and the son;\nBy virtue as by nature close ally'd,\nThe painter's genius, but without the pride:\nWorth unambitious, wit afraid to shine,\nHonour's clear light, and friendship's warmth divine:\nThe son fair rising knew too short a date;\nBut, oh! how more severe the father's fate!\nHe saw him torn untimely from his side,\nFelt all a father's anguish—weeping and died.\n\nMr Aikman's style of painting was an imitation of the pleasing simplicity of nature. It is distinguished by softness of light, mellowness of shade, and mildness and harmony of colouring. His compositions have more placid tranquillity of ease, than boldness of touch and brilliancy of effect. His portraits are supposed to have some resemblance to those of Kneller, and not only in the imitation of the dresses of the time, but in the similarity of tint and manner of working.\n\nAILANA, AILATH, or AHELOTH, anciently a town of Arabia Petraea, situated near the Sinus Elatites of the Red sea. It was also called Eliath, and Eloth (Stephanus, Strabo, Moses). The same with Elana.\n\nAILANTHUS, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAILE, in Law, a writ which lies where a person's grandfather, or great-grandfather, being seised of lands, &c. in fee-simple, the day that he died, and a stranger abates and enters the same day, and disfranchises the heir of his inheritance.\n\nAILSBURY, AYLESBURY, or ALESBURY, a borough town in Buckinghamshire, consisting of about 400 houses. The streets lie round the market-place, in the middle of which is a convenient hall, where the sessions are held, and sometimes the assizes for the county. It sends two members to parliament. It is sixty miles south-east of Buckingham, and forty-four north-west of London. W. Long. o. 40. N. Lat. 51. 40.\n\nAILMER, or Æthelmaræ, earl of Cornwall and Devonshire, in the reign of King Edgar. It is not known what family he was. His authority and riches were great, and so also in appearance was his piety. He founded the abbey of Cernel, in Dorsetshire; and had so great a veneration for Eadwald, the brother of St Edmund the Martyr, who had lived a hermit in that country, near the Silver Well, as they called it, that, with the assistance of Archbishop Dunstan, he translated his relics to the old church of Cernel. In 1016, when Canute, the son of Sueno, invaded England, and found himself stoutly opposed by that valiant Saxon prince Edmund Ironside, the son of Æthelred, this Earl Ailmer, with that arch traitor Eadric Streone, earl of Mercia, and Earl Algar, joined the Dane against their natural prince, which was one great cause of the Saxon's ruin. He did not long survive this; and we find mentioned in history only one son of his, whose name was Æthelward, earl of Cornwall, who followed his father's maxims, and was properly rewarded for it. For in 1018, Canute reaping the benefit of their treasons, and perceiving that the traitors were no longer useful, he caused the infamous Eadric Streone, and this Earl Æthelward, to be both put to death.\n\nAILRED, or EALRED, abbot of Revelby in Lincolnshire, in the reigns of Stephen and Henry II. He was born in 1109, of a noble family, and educated in Scotland with Henry the son of King David. On his return to England, he became a monk of the Cistercian order, in the monastery of Revelby, of which he afterwards was made abbot. He died on the 12th of January 1166, aged 57, and was buried in his monastery. \"He was (says Leland) in great esteem during his life; celebrated for the miracles wrought after his death; and admitted into the catalogue of saints.\" He was author of several works; most of which were published by Gilbo the Jesuit at Douay, 1631; part of them may be also found in the Bibliotheca Cisterciensis, and Bibliotheca Patrum. His principal work is the Speculum charitatis. Leland, Bale, and Pits, mention several manuscripts which never were published.\n\nAILSA, an inflated rock on the western coast of Scotland, between the shores of Ayrshire and Cantire. It is two miles in circumference at the base, is accessible only at one place, and rises to a great height in a pyramidal form. A few goats and rabbits pick up a subsistence among the short galls and furze; but the importance\nAir importance of the rock consists in the great variety and immense numbers of birds which frequent it, particularly the gannets or folan geese, some of which are taken for the table, and others for the feathers. The rock is rented from the earl of Caflillis at £31 per annum. The depth of water around the base is from 7 to 48 fathoms. It is surrounded with excellent banks, well stocked with cod and other white fish. On one part of the rock are the remains of an old castle, which is said to have been erected by Philip II. of Spain, about the time that the Spanish armada invaded Britain.\n\nAINSWORTH, Dr Henry, an eminent nonconformist divine, who, about the year 1590, distinguished himself among the Brownists; which drew upon him such troubles that he was obliged to retire to Holland, and became minister of a church at Amsterdam. His skill in the Hebrew language, and his excellent Annotations on the Holy Scriptures, which are still highly esteemed, gained him great reputation. He also wrote several pieces in defence of the Brownists, and several other works.\n\nAINSWORTH, Robert, born at Woodyale in Lancashire in 1660, was master of a boarding school at Bethnal green, from whence he removed to Hackney, and to other places in the neighbourhood of London. After acquiring a moderate fortune, he retired, and lived privately till the time of his death, which happened in 1743. We are indebted to his industry for a Latin and English Dictionary, which has been much used in schools: he published it in quarto 1736; and in 1752, the fourth edition, under the care of Dr Ward of Gresham College, and the Rev. William Younge, was enlarged to two vols. folio.\n\nAir, in Physics, a thin, fluid, elastic, transparent, ponderous, compressible, and dilatable body, surrounding the terraqueous globe to a considerable height. See Atmosphere, Meteorology, and Pneumatics.\n\nAir, in Mythology, was adored by the Heathens under the names of Jupiter and Juno; the former representing the superior and finer part of the atmosphere, and the latter the inferior and groser part. The augurs also drew prefiges from the clouds, thunder, lightning, &c.\n\nAir, in Painting, &c., denotes the manner and very life of action; or it is that which expresses the disposition of the agent.—It is sometimes also used in a synonymous sense with gleeure or attitude.\n\nAir, in Music, is taken in different senses. It is sometimes contrasted with harmony; and, in this sense, it is synonymous with melody in general.—Its proper meaning is, A tune, which is set to words, or to short pieces of poetry that are called songs.\n\nIn operas, we give the name of air to such pieces of music as are formed with measures and cadences, to distinguish it from the recitative; and, in general, every piece of music is called an air, which is formed for the voice, or even for instruments, and adapted to stanzas, whether it forms a whole in itself, or whether it can be detached from any whole of which it forms a part, and be executed alone.\n\nIf the subject admits of harmony, and is set in parts, the air is, according to their number, denominated a duett, a trio, a quartetto, &c. We need not follow Rouffleau, and the other philologists, in their endeavours to investigate the etymology of the word air. Its derivation, though found and ascertained, would contribute little to illustrate its meaning in that remote sense, to which, through a long continuance of time, and the various vicissitudes of language, it has now passed. The curious may consult the same article in the Dictionnaire de Musique by M. Rouffleau.\n\nIn modern music, there are several different kinds of airs, each of which agrees to a certain kind of dancing; and from these dances the airs themselves take their specific names.\n\nThe airs of our operas are, if we may be permitted the expression, the canvas or substratum upon which are painted all the pictures of imitative music; melody is the design, and harmony the colouring; every picturesque object selected from the most beautiful parts of nature, every reflected sentiment of the human heart, are the models which the artist imitates; whatever gains attention, whatever interests the soul, whatever charms the ear, or causes emotion in the heart, these are the objects of his imitation. An air which delights the ear, and discovers the learning of the composer; an air invented by genius, and composed with taste; is the noblest effort of music: it is this which explores the compass, and displays the delicacy, of a beautiful voice; it is in this where the charms of a well conducted symphony shine; it is by this, that the passions, excited and inflamed by nice gradations, reach and agitate the soul through the avenues of external sense. After hearing a beautiful air, the mind is agreeable and serene: the ear is satisfied, not disgusted: it remains impressed on the fancy, it becomes a part of our essence, we carry it with us, we are able to repeat it at pleasure: without the ability acquired by habit to breathe a single note of it, we execute it in our imagination in the same manner as we heard it upon the theatre: one sees the scene, the actor, the theatre; one hears the accompaniments and the applause. The real enthusiast in music never forgets the beautiful airs which he has heard; when he chooses, he causes the opera to recommence.\n\nThe words to which airs are adapted are not always rehearsed in regular succession, nor spoken in the same manner with those of the recitative; and though, in general, they are very short, yet they are interrupted, repeated, transposed, at the pleasure of the artist. They do not constitute a narrative, which once is told over: they either delineate a picture, which it is necessary to contemplate in different points of view; or inspire a sentiment in which the heart acquiesces with pleasure, and from which it is neither able nor willing to be disengaged; and the different phrases of the air, are nothing else but different manners of beholding the same image. This is the reason why the subject of an air should be one. It is by these repetitions properly placed, it is by these redoubled efforts, that an impression, which at first was not able to move you, at length shakes your soul, agitates you, transports you out of yourself; and it is likewise upon the same principle, that the runnings, as they are called, or those long, mazy, and inarticulated inflections of the voice, in pathetic airs, frequently seem, though they are not always so, improperly placed: for whilst the heart is affected with a sentiment equitably moving, it often expresses its emotions by inarticulate sounds, more strongly and sensibly than it could do by words themselves.\nThe form of airs is of two kinds. The small airs are often composed of two strains, which ought each of them to be sung twice; but the important airs in operas are frequently in the form of rondellas.\n\nAir, in Geography. See Ayr.\n\nAir-Bladder, in fishes. See Comparative Anatomy and Ichthyology Index.\n\nAir-Gun, a pneumatic machine for exploding bullets, &c., with great violence. See Pneumatics.\n\nAir-Jacket, a sort of jacket made of leather, in which are several bags, or bladders, composed of the same materials, communicating with each other. These are filled with air through a leather tube, having a brass stop-cock accurately ground at the extremity, by which means the air blown in through the tube is confined in the bladders. The jacket must be wet, before the air be blown into the bags, as otherwise it will immediately escape through the pores of the leather. By the help of these bladders, which are placed near the breast, the person is supported in the water, without making the efforts used in swimming.\n\nAir-Pipes, an invention for drawing foul air out of ships, or any other close places, by means of fire. These pipes were first found out by one Mr Sutton, a brewer in London; and from him have got the name of Sutton's Air-pipes. The principle on which their operation depends is known to everybody, being indeed no other than that air is necessary for the support of fire; and, if it has not access from the places most adjacent, will not fail to come from those that are more remote. Thus, in a common furnace, the air enters through the ash-hole; but if this is closed up, and a hole made in the side of the furnace, the air will rush in with great violence through that hole. If a tube of any length whatever be inserted in this hole, the air will rush through the tube into the fire, and of consequence there will be a continued circulation of air in that place where the extremity of the tube is laid. Mr Sutton's contrivance then, as communicated to the Royal Society by Doctor Mead, amounts to no more than this.—\"As, in every ship of any bulk, there is already provided a copper or boiling place proportionable to the size of the vessel; it is proposed to clear the bad air, by means of the fire already used under the said coppers or boiling places for the necessary uses of the ship.\n\n\"It is also well known, that under every such copper or boiler, there are placed two holes, separated by a grate; the first of which is for the fire, and the other for the ashes falling from the same; and that there is also a flue from the fire-place upward, by which the smoke of the fire is discharged at some convenient place of the ship.\n\n\"It is also well known, that the fire once lighted in these fire-places, is only preserved by the constant draught of air through the forementioned two holes and flue; and that if the said two holes are closely stopped up, the fire, though burning ever so briskly before, is immediately put out.\n\n\"But if, after stopping up the abovementioned holes, another hole be opened, communicating with any other room or airy place, and with the fire; it is clear, the said fire must again be raised and burn as before, there being a light draught of air through the same as there was before the stopping up of the first holes; this case differing only from the former in this, that Air-Pipes, the air feeding the fire will now be supplied from another place.\n\n\"It is therefore proposed, that, in order to clear the holds of ships of the bad air therein contained, the two holes above mentioned, the fire-place and ash-place, be both closed up with substantial and tight iron doors; and that a copper or leaden pipe, of sufficient size, be laid from the hold into the ash-place, for the draught of air to come in that way to feed the fire. And thus it seems plain, from what has been already said, that there will be, from the hold, a constant discharge of the air therein contained; and consequently, that that air, so discharged, must be as constantly supplied by fresh air down the hatches or such other communications as are opened into the hold; whereby the same must be continually refreshed, and its air rendered more wholesome and fit for respiration.\n\n\"And if into this principal pipe so laid into the hold, other pipes are let in, communicating respectively either with the well or lower decks; it must follow, that part of the air, consumed in feeding the fire, must be respectively drawn out of all such places to which the communication shall be so made.\"\n\nThis account is so plain, that no doubt can remain concerning the efficacy of the contrivance: it is evident, that, by means of pipes of this kind, a constant circulation of fresh air would be occasioned through those places where it would otherwise be most apt to stagnate and putrefy. Several other contrivances have been used for the same purpose; and Dr Hales's ventilators, by some unaccountable prejudice, have been reckoned superior in efficacy and even simplicity to Mr Sutton's machine, which at its first invention met with great opposition, and even when introduced by Dr Mead, who used all his interest for that purpose, was shamefully neglected.\n\nA machine capable of answering the same purpose was invented by Mr Defaguliers, which he called the ship's lungs. It consisted of a cylindrical box set up on its edge, and fixed to a wooden pedestal. From the upper edge of the box issued a square trunk open at the end, and communicating with the cavity of the box. Within this box was placed a cylindrical wheel turning on an axis. It was divided into 12 parts, by means of partitions placed like the radii of a circle. These partitions did not extend quite to the centre, but left an open space of about 18 inches diameter in the middle; towards the circumference, they extended as far as possible without interfering with the case, so that the wheel might always be allowed to turn freely.—Things being thus circumstanced, it is plain, that if the wheel was turned towards that side of the box on which the trunk was, every division would push the air before it, and drive it out through the trunk, at the same time that fresh air would come in through the open space at the centre, to supply that which was thrown out through the trunk. By turning the wheel swiftly, a strong blast of air would be continually forced out through the square trunk, on the same principles on which a common fanner winnows corn. If the wheel is turned the opposite way, a draught of air may be produced from the trunk to the centre. If this machine, then, is placed in a room where a circulation of air is wanted, and the trunk made to pass through one of\nAir-Pump of the walls; by turning the wheel swiftly round, the air will be forced with great velocity out of that room, at the same time that fresh air will enter through any chinks by which it can have access to supply that which has been forced out.\n\nIt is evident, that the circulation which is promoted by this machine, is entirely of the same kind with that produced by Mr Sutton's; the turning of the wheel in Mr Defagulliers's machine being equivalent to the rarefaction of the air by fire in Mr Sutton's: but that the latter is vastly superior, as acting of itself, and without intermission, requires no arguments to prove. Mr Sutton's machine has yet another convenience, of which no other contrivance for the same purpose can boast; namely, that it not only draws out putrid air, but destroys it by causing it pass through fire; and experience has abundantly shown, that though putrid air is thrown into a great quantity of fresh air, it is so far from losing its pernicious properties, that it often produces noxious effects. We do not say, indeed, that putrid air becomes salutary by this means; but it is undoubtedly rendered less noxious than before; though whether it is equally innocent with the smoke of a fire fed in the common way, we cannot pretend to determine.\n\nBesides this machine by Mr Defagulliers, the ventilators of Dr Hales, already mentioned, and those called wind-sails, are likewise used for the same purpose. The former of which is an improvement of the Hessian bellows; the other is a contrivance for throwing fresh air into those places where putrid air is apt to lodge; but this has the last-mentioned inconvenience in a much greater degree than any of the others, as the blast of fresh air throws out that which was rendered putrid by stagnation, in such a manner as to contaminate all around it.\n\nAir-Pump, a machine by which the air contained in a proper vessel may be exhausted or drawn out. See Pneumatics.\n\nAir-Sacs, in Birds. See Comparative Anatomy.\n\nAir-Shafts, among Miners, denote holes or shafts let down from the open air to meet the adits and furnish fresh air. The damps, deficiency, and impurity of air which occur, when adits are wrought 30 or 40 fathoms long, make it necessary to let down air-shafts, in order to give the air liberty to play through the whole work, and thus discharge bad vapours, and furnish good air for respiration: the expense of which shafts, in regard of their vast depths, hardness of the rock, drawing of water, &c., sometimes equals, nay exceeds, the ordinary charge of the whole adit.\n\nSir Robert Murray describes a method, used in the coal-mines at Liege, of working mines without air-shafts.\n\nWhen the miners at Mendip have sunk a groove, they will not be at the charge of an air-shaft till they come at ore; and for the supply of air have boxes of elm exactly closed, of about six inches in the clear, by which they carry it down about twenty fathoms. They cut a trench at a little distance from the top of the groove, covering it with turf and rods disposed to receive the pipe, which they contrive to come in sidewise to their groove, four feet from the top; which carries down the air to a great depth. When they come at ore, and need an air-shaft, they sink it four or five fathoms distant, according to the convenience of the breadth, and of the same fashion with the groove, to draw ore as well as air.\n\nAir-Threads, in Natural History, a name given to the long filaments, so frequently seen in autumn floating about in the air.\n\nThese threads are the work of spiders, especially of that species called the long-legged field-spider; which, having mounted to the summit of a bush or tree, darts from its tail several of these threads, till one is produced capable of supporting the creature in the air: on this it mounts in quest of prey, and frequently rises to a very considerable height. See Aranea.\n\nAir-Trunk, is also a contrivance by Dr. Hales to prevent the stagnation of putrid effluvia in jails, and other places where a great number of people are crowded together in a small space. It consists only of a long square trunk open at both ends; one of which is inserted into the ceiling of the room, the air of which is required to be kept pure; and the other extends a good way beyond the roof. Through this trunk a continued circulation is carried on: and the reason is, that the putrid effluvia which do so much mischief when collected, being much lighter than the pure atmosphere, arise to the top of the room; and, if they there find a vent, will continually go out through it. These effluvia arise in very considerable quantity, being calculated by the late Dr Keil at no less than 39 ounces on one man in 24 hours.\n\nThese trunks were first made trial of by Mr Yeoman, over the House of Commons, where they were nine inches wide within; and over the Court of King's Bench in Westminster-hall, where they were six inches wide. They are sometimes made wider, and sometimes narrower: but the wider they are the longer they ought to be, more effectually to promote the ascent of the vapours. The reason why vapours of this kind ascend more swiftly through a long trunk than a short one, is, that the pressure of fluids is always according to their different depth, without regard to the diameter of their basis, or of the vessel which contains them; and, upon this principle, a gallon of water may be made to split a strong cask. See Hydrostatics. When the column of putrid effluvia is long and narrow, the difference between the columns of atmosphere preëxisting on the upper end of the trunk, and that which preëxists on the lower end, is much greater than if the column of putrid effluvia was short and wide; and consequently the ascent is much swifter.—One pan of a single pair of scales, which was two inches in diameter, being held within one of these trunks over the House of Commons, the force of the ascending air made it rise so as to require four grains to restore the equilibrium, and this when there was no person in the house; but when it was full, no less than 12 grains were requisite to restore the equilibrium; which clearly shows that these trunks must be of real and very great efficacy.\n\nAir-Vessels, are spiral ducts in the leaves, &c., of plants, supposed to be analogous to the lungs of animals, in supplying the different parts of a plant with air. See Botany Index.\n\nAIRA, in Botany, Hair-grass. See Botany Index.\n\nAIRANI, in Church-history, an obscure sect of Arians, in the fourth century, who denied the consubstantiality of the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son. They are otherwise called Airanists; and are said to have\nhave taken their name from one Aire, who distinguished himself at the head of this party, in the reigns of Valentinian and Gratian.\n\nAIRE, in Geography, an ancient town of France, in the department of Landes, formerly Gaifony. It is seated on the river Adour, on the declivity of a mountain, 155 leagues from Paris. E. Long. 5° 26'. N.

It was taken by the French in 1710, and was confirmed to them by the treaty of Utrecht. It is seated on the river Lis, 22 miles south of Dunkirk, and communicates with St Omer's by a canal cut from the river Aa. E. Long. 2° 31'. N. Lat. 50° 38'.\n\nAIRING, a term peculiarly used for the exercising horses in the open air. It purifies the blood; purges the body from gross humours; and, as the jockeys express it, teaches the horse how to make his wind rake equally, and keep time with the other motions of his body. It also sharpens the stomach, and keeps the creature hungry; which is a thing of great consequence, as hunters and racers are very apt to have their stomach fall off, either from want of exercise, or from the too violent exercise which they are often exposed to. If the horse be over fat, it is best to air him before sunrise and after sunsetting; and in general, it is allowed by all, that nothing is more beneficial to those creatures than early and late airings. Some of our modern managers, however, dispute this; they say, that the cold of these times is too great for the creature; and that if, in particular, he is subject to catarrhs, rheums, or the like complaints, the dews and cold fogs, in these early and late airings, will be apt to increase all those disorders. Nature, we see, also points out the sun-beams as of great use to these animals; those which are kept hardy and lie out all night, always running to those places where the sunshine comes, as soon as it appears in a morning. This should seem to recommend these airings that are to be made before sunrise, and a little time after sunrise. As to the caution, so earnestly inculcated by Markham, of using these early and late airings for fat horses, it is found unnecessary by many: for they say, that the same effect may be produced by airings at warmer times, provided only that they are made longer; and that, in general, it is from long airings that we are to expect to bring a horse to a perfect wind and sound courage.\n\nAIRS, in the Manege, are the artificial motions of taught horses; as the demivolte, curvet, capriole, &c.\n\nAIRY, or AERY, among Sportmen, a term expressing the nest of a hawk or eagle.\n\nAIRY Triplicity, among Astrologers, denotes the three signs, Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius.\n\nAISNE, a river of France, which rises in Champagne, and runs west by Soisson's in the Isle of France, falling into the river Oise, a little above Compiegne.\n\nIt gives name to one of the five departments which comprehend the ancient Isle of France, and contains five communal districts.\n\nAITOCZU, a considerable river of Lesser Asia, which rises in Mount Taurus, and falls into the south part of the Euxine sea.\n\nAITON, WILLIAM, an eminent botanist and gardener, was born at a village near Hamilton in Scotland, in 1731. Having been regularly trained to the profession of a gardener, he came into England in the year 1754, and soon obtained the notice of the celebrated Philip Miller, then superintendent of the physic-garden at Chelsea, who engaged him as an assistant. His industry and abilities recommended him to the princess-dowager of Wales as a fit person to manage the botanical garden at Kew. In 1759, he was appointed to this office, in which he continued during life, and which was the source of his fame and fortune. The garden at Kew, under the auspices of his present majesty, was defined to be the grand repository of all the vegetable riches which could be accumulated, by regal munificence, from researches through every quarter of the globe. These treasures were fortunately committed to the hands of Mr Aiton, whose care and skill in their cultivation, and intelligence in their arrangement, acquired him high reputation among the lovers of the science, and the particular esteem of his royal patrons. Under his superintendence, many improvements took place in the plan and edifices of Kew-gardens, which rendered them the principal scene of botanical culture in the kingdom. In 1783, his merit was properly rewarded with the lucrative office of managing the pleasure and kitchen-gardens of Kew, which he was allowed to retain with the botanical department. In 1789, he published his Hortus Kewensis; or a Catalogue of the Plants cultivated in the Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, in three vols. 8vo. with 15 plates; a work which had been the labour of many years. The number of species contained in this work amounted to between five and six thousand, many of which had not before been described. A new and curious article in it relates to the first introduction of particular exotics into the English gardens. The system of arrangement adopted is the Linnean, with improvements, which the advanced state of botanical science required. Mr Aiton with candour and modesty acknowledges the affluence he received in this work from the two eminent Swedish naturalists, Dr Solander and Mr Jonas Dryander. Indeed his character was such as secured him the friendship and good offices of the most distinguished names in science of his time. He was for many years peculiarly honoured by the notice of Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society. The Hortus Kewensis was received with avidity by the botanic world, and a large impression was soon disposed of.\n\nNotwithstanding the singular activity and temperance of Mr Aiton, he fell into that incurable malady, a schirrous liver, of which he died in 1793, in his fifty-second year. His eldest son, devoted to the same pursuits, was, by the king's own nomination, appointed to all his father's employments. Mr Aiton's private character was highly estimable for mildness, benevolence, piety, and every domestic and social virtue. He was interred in the churchyard of Kew, amidst a most respectable concourse of friends. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAITONIA, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAJUGA, Bugle, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nALUS LOCUTIUS, the name of a deity to whom the Romans erected an altar. The words are Latin, and signify \"a speaking voice.\" The following accident gave occasion to the Romans erecting an altar to\n\nAius\nAjutage, Aius Locutius. One M. Sedilius, a plebeian, acquainted the tribunes, that, in walking the streets by night, he had heard a voice over the temple of Veja, giving the Romans notice that the Gauls were coming against them. This intimation was, however, neglected; but after the truth was confirmed by the event, Camillus acknowledged this voice to be a new deity, and erected an altar to it under the name of Aius Locutius.\n\nAJUTAGE, or ADJUTAGE, a kind of tube fitted to the mouth of the veifel through which the water of a fountain is to be played. To the different form and structure of ajutages is owing the great variety of fountains.\n\nAIX, a small but ancient town in the duchy of Savoy, with the title of a marquisate. It is seated on the lake Bourget, at the foot of a mountain, between Chamberry, Annecy, and Rumilly. There is here a triumphal arch of the ancient Romans, but it is almost entirely ruined. The mineral waters bring a great number of strangers to this place. The place was originally called Aquae Gratianae, from the hot baths built there by the emperor Gratian. E. Long. 5. 48. N. Lat. 45. 40.\n\nAix, in Geography, an ancient city, the capital of the department of the Bouches du Rhone, formerly Provence, in France. This city has an air of silence and gloom common characteristic of places delitute of commerce or indultry. It is, however, well built; and most like Paris of any place in the kingdom, as well for the largeness of the buildings as in respect of the politeness of the inhabitants. It is embellished with abundance of fine fountains, and several beautiful squares. The Preachers square is on the side of a hill; it is about 160 yards in length, and is surrounded with trees, and houses built with stone three stories high. The town-hall is at one end of the city, and is distributed into several fine apartments: the two lowest are taken up by the board of accounts, and by the senechal; that above is designed for the sessions of parliament. The hall of audience is adorned with the pictures of the kings of France on horseback. The hotel of the city is a handsome building, but hid by the houses of the narrow street in which it is placed. The cathedral church is a Gothic structure, with tombs of several earls of Provence, and some good pictures by French masters. The Corfe, or Orbitelle, is a magnificent walk, above 300 yards long, formed by a triple avenue of elms, and two rows of regular and stately houses. The church of the fathers of the oratory is a handsome building; and not far from thence is the chapel of the blue penitents, which is full of paintings. The convent of preachers is very fine; in their church is a silver statue of the Virgin Mary almost as big as the life. There are other churches and buildings which contain a great number of rarities. The baths without the city, which were discovered not long since, have good buildings, raised at a vast expense, for the accommodation of those who drink the waters. Although Aix was the first Roman settlement in Gaul, it is not remarkable for ancient remains. The warm springs, from which it is now known and frequented, induced Sextus Calvinius to found a colony here, to which he gave the name of Aquae Sextiae. They were supposed to possess particular virtues in cases of debility; and several altars have been dug up sacred to Priapus, the inscriptions on which indicate their gratitude to that deity for his supposed succour and assistance. E. Long. 5. 32. N. Lat. 43. 32.\n\nAix-la-Chapelle, a small island on the coast of France, between the ile of Oleron and the continent. It is 12 miles north-west of Rochefort, and 12 fourth-louth-west of Rochelle. W. Long. 1. 4. N. Lat. 46. 5.\n\nAix-la-Chapelle, a fine city of Germany, in the circle of Westphalia and duchy of Juliers, and capital of the department of Roer.\n\nAll authors are agreed about its antiquity, it being mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries and the Annals of Tacitus. The Romans had colonies and fortresses there, when they were at war with the Germans; but the mineral waters and the hot bath so increased its fame, that, in process of time, it was advanced to the privileges of a city, by the name of Aquaegranii, that is, the waters of Granius; that which it has now, of Aix-la-Chapelle, was given it by the French, to distinguish it from the other Aix. It is so called, on account of a chapel built in honour of the Holy Virgin by Charlemagne; who having repaired, beautified, and enlarged the city, which was destroyed by the Huns in the reign of Attila in 451, made it the usual place of his residence. The town is seated in a valley surrounded with mountains and woods, and yet the air is very wholesome. It may be divided into the inward and outward city. The inward is encompassed with a wall about three quarters of a league in circumference, having ten gates; and the outward wall, in which there are eleven gates, is about a league and a half in circumference. There are rivulets which run through the town and keep it very clean, turning several mills; besides 20 public fountains, and many private ones. They have stone quarries in the neighbourhood, which furnish the inhabitants with proper materials for their magnificent buildings, of which the Stadt-house and the cathedral are the chief. There are likewise 30 parochial or collegiate churches. The market-place is very spacious, and the houses round it are stately. In the middle, before the Stadt-house, is a fountain of blue stones, which throws out water, from six pipes, into a marble basin placed beneath, 30 feet in circumference. On the top of this fountain is placed the statue of Charlemagne, of gilt brass, holding a sceptre in his right hand, and a globe in his left. The Stadt-house is adorned with the statues of all the emperors since Charlemagne. This fabric has three stories, the upper of which is one entire room of 160 feet in length and 60 in breadth. In this the newly-elected emperor formerly entertained all the electors of the empire.\n\nAix-la-Chapelle is a free imperial city, and changes its magistracy every year on the eve of St John Baptist. The mayor is in the nomination of the elector palatine, in the quality of the duke of Juliers, as protector of the city. This place is famous for several councils and treaties of peace concluded here; particularly those between France and Spain in 1668, and between Great Britain and France in 1748.\n\nThe hot sulphurous waters for which this place has so long been celebrated, arise from several sources, which supply eight baths constructed in different parts of the town. These waters near the sources are clear and\nand pellucid; and have a strong sulphureous smell resembling the washings of a foul gun; but they lose this smell by exposure to air. Their taste is saline, bitter, and urinous. They do not contain iron. They are also neutral near the fountain, but afterwards are manifestly and pretty strongly alkaline, inasmuch that clothes are washed with them without soap. On the vaults above the springs and aqueducts of these waters is found, every year, when they are opened, a quantity of fine white-coloured flowers of sulphur, which has been sublimed from the waters.\n\nThe heat of the water of the hottest spring, by Dr Lucas's account, raises the quicksilver of Fahrenheit's thermometer to $136^\\circ$—by Mons. Monet's account, to $146^\\circ$—and the heat of the fountain, where they commonly drink, by Dr Lucas's account, to $112^\\circ$.\n\nDr Simmons has given the following account of their several temperatures, as repeatedly observed by himself with a thermometer constructed by Nairne.\n\nThe spring which supplies the Emperor's Bath (Bain de l'Empereur), the New Bath (Bain Neuf), and the Queen of Hungary's Bath (Bain de la Reine de Hongrie),\n\n- St Quirin's Bath (Bain de St Quirin) - $127^\\circ$\n- The Rose bath (Bain de la Rose), and the Poor's Bath (Bain des Pauvres), both which are supplied by the same spring. - $112^\\circ$\n- Charles's Bath (Bain de Charles), and St Corneille's Bath (Bain de St Corneille). - $112^\\circ$\n\nThe spring used for drinking is in the High Street, opposite to Charles's Bath; the heat of it at the pump is - $106^\\circ$\n\nDr Lucas evaporated the water of the hottest spring (of the Emperor's Bath), and obtained 268 grains of solid matter from a gallon, composed of 15 grains of calcareous earth, 10 grains of selenites, and 243 grains of a saline matter made up of natron and sea-salt. They are at first nauseous and harsh, but by habit become familiar and agreeable. At first drinking, also, they generally affect the head. Their general operation is by stool and urine, without griping or diminution of strength; and they also promote perspiration.\n\nThe quantity to be drank, as an alternative is to be varied according to the constitution and other circumstances of the patient. In general, it is best to begin with a quarter or half a pint in the morning, and increase the dose afterwards to a pint, as may be found convenient. The water is best drank at the fountain. When it is required to purge, it should be drank in large and often repeated draughts.\n\nIn regard to bathing, this also must be determined by the age, sex, strength, &c. of the patient, and by the season. The degree of heat of the bath should likewise be considered. The tepid ones are in general the best, though there are some cases in which the hotter ones are most proper. But even in these, it is best to begin with the temperate baths, and increase the heat gradually.\n\nThese waters are efficacious in diseases proceeding from indigestion and from foulness of the stomach and bowels; in rheumatism; in the scurvy, scrophula, and diseases of the skin; in hysterical and hypochondriacal disorders; in nervous complaints and melancholy; in the stone and gravel; in paralytic complaints; in those evils which follow an injudicious use of mercury; and in many other cases. They ought not, however, to be given in hectic cases where there is heat and fever, in putrid disorders, or where the blood is dissolved or the constitution much broken down.\n\nThe time of drinking, in the first season, is from the beginning of May to the middle of June; and, in the latter season, from the middle of August to the latter end of September.\n\nThere are galleries or piazzas under which the company walk during the time of drinking, in order to promote the operation of the waters.—The Poor's Bath is free for everybody, and is frequented by crowds of poor people.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to add, that there are all kinds of amusements common to other places of public resort; but the sharpers appear more splendid here than elsewhere, affuming titles, with an equipage suitable to them. This city was taken by the French in 1792. They lost it the year following, but retook it in 1794. Aix-la-Chapelle is 21 miles from Spa, 36 from Liege, and 30 from Cologne. E. Long. 5° 48'. N. Lat. 51° 53'.\n\nAIZOON, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAKENSIDE, Mark, a physician, who published in Latin \"A Treatise upon the Dysentery,\" in 1764, and a few pieces in the first volume of the \"Medical Transactions\" of the college of physicians, printed in 1768; but far better known, and to be distinguished chiefly hereafter, as a poet. He was born at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, November 9, 1721; and after being educated at the grammar-school in Newcastle, was sent to the universities of Edinburgh and Leyden; at which last he took his degree of doctor in physic. He was afterwards admitted by mandamus to the same degree at Cambridge; elected a fellow of the college of physicians, and one of the physicians at St Thomas's Hospital; and, upon the establishment of the queen's household, appointed one of the physicians to her majesty.\n\nThat Dr Akenside was able to acquire no other kind of celebrity than that of a scholar and a poet, is to be accounted for by the following particulars in his life and conduct, related by Sir John Hawkins.—Mr Dyson and he were fellow-students, the one of law and the other of physic, at Leyden; where, being of congenial tempers, a friendship commenced between them that lasted through their lives. They left the university at the same time, and both settled in London: Mr Dyson took to the bar, and being possessed of a handsome fortune, supported his friend while he was endeavouring to make himself known as a physician; but in a short time, having purchased of Mr Hardinge his place of clerk of the house of commons, he quitted Westminster-hall; and for the purpose of introducing Akenside to acquaintance in an opulent neighbourhood near the town, bought a house at North-End, Hampstead; where they dwelt together during the summer season, frequenting the long-room, and all clubs and assemblies of the inhabitants.\n\nAt these meetings, which, as they were not select, must be supposed to have consisted of such persons as usually meet for the purpose of gossiping, men of wealth, but of ordinary endowments, and able to talk of little else than news and the occurrences of the day, Akenside was for displaying those talents which had acquired him the reputation he enjoyed in other companies:\nAKIBA, a famous rabbin, flourished a little after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. He kept the flocks of a rich citizen of Jerusalem till the 49th year of his age, and then devoted himself to study in the academies for 24 years; and was afterwards one of the greatest matters in Israel. According to the Jewish accounts, he had 24,000 scholars. He declared for the impostor Barcochebas, whom he owned for the Messiah; and not only anointed him king, but took upon himself the office of his master of the horse. The troops which the emperor Hadrian sent against the Jews, who under the conduct of this false Messiah had committed horrid massacres, exterminated this faction. Akiba was taken, and put to death with great cruelty. He lived 120 years; and was buried with his wife in a cave upon a mountain not far from Tiberias, and his 24,000 scholars were buried round about him upon the same mountain. It is imagined he invented a supposititious work under the name of the patriarch Abraham.\n\nAKISSAT, the ancient Thyatira, a city in Natolia, in Asia, situated in a plain 18 miles broad, which produces plenty of cotton and grain. The inhabitants who are reckoned to be about 5000, are said to be all Mahometans. The houses are built of nothing but earth or turf dried in the sun, and are very low and ill contrived; but there are six or seven mosques, which are all of marble. There are remarkable inscriptions on marble in several parts of the town, which are part of the ruins of the ancient Thyatira. It is seated on the river Hermus, 50 miles from Pergamos. E. Long. 28° 30'. N. Lat. 38° 50'.\n\nAKOND, an officer of justice in Persia, who takes cognizance of the causes of orphans and widows; of contracts, and other civil concerns. He is the head of the school of law, and gives lectures to all the subaltern officers; he has his deputies in all the courts of the kingdom, who, with the second jadra, make all contracts.\n\nAL, an Arabic particle prefixed to words, and signifying much the same with the English particle the: Thus they say, alkermes, alkoran, &c. i.e. the kerme, the koran, &c.\n\nAL, or ALD, a Saxon term frequently prefixed to the names of places, denoting their antiquity; as Aldborough, Aldgate, &c.\n\nALA, a Latin term properly signifying a wing; from a resemblance to which several other things are called by the same name: Thus,\n\nALA, is a term used by botanists for the hollow of a stalk, which either the leaf, or the pedicle of the leaf, makes with it; or it is that hollow turning, or sinus, placed between the stalk or branch of a plant and the leaf, whence a new offspring usually issues. Sometimes it is used for those parts of leaves otherwise called lobes, or wings.\n\nALAE (the plural number) is used to signify those petals or leaves of papilionaceous flowers, placed between those others which are called the vexillum and carina, and which make the top and bottom of the flowers. Instances of flowers of this structure are seen in those of peas and beans, in which the top leaf or petal is the vexillum, the bottom the carina, and the side ones the ale.\n\nALAE is also used for those extremely slender and membranaceous\nmembranaceous parts of some seeds, which appear as wings placed on them; it likewise signifies those membranaceous expansions running along the stems of some plants, which are therefore called alated stalks.\n\nALAE, in Anatomy, a term applied to the lobes of the liver, the cartilages of the nostril, &c.\n\nALAE, in the Roman Art of War, were the two wings or extreme parts of the army drawn up in order of battle.\n\nALABA, one of the three smallest districts of Biscay in Spain, but pretty fertile in rye, barley, and fruits. There are in it very good mines of iron, and it had formerly the title of a kingdom.\n\nALABANDA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Caria, near the Meander, situated beneath eminences resembling asses with pack-faddles, which gave rise to the jest; and between Amyzo to the west and Stratonice to the east. Under the Romans they enjoyed suffrages, or a convention of jurisdiction, by Pliny reckoned the fourth in order; hence the proverb in Stephanus, expressing their happiness. It was built by Alabandus, whom therefore they deemed a god. The people were called Alabandi, Alabandenses (Cicero); and Alabandei, after the Greek manner, in coins of Augustus and Claudius; they were also called Alabandeni (Livy).\n\nALABARCA, in Antiquity, a kind of magistrate among the Jews of Alexandria, whom the emperors allowed them to elect, for the superintendency of their policy, and to decide differences and disputes which arose among them.\n\nALABASTER, William, an English divine, was born at Hadley in the county of Suffolk. He was one of the doctors of Trinity college in Cambridge; and he attended the earl of Essex as his chaplain in the expedition to Cadiz in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is said, that his first resolutions of changing his religion were occasioned by his seeing the pomp of the churches of the Roman communion, and the respect with which the priests seemed to be treated amongst them; and appearing thus to waver in his mind, he soon found persons who took advantage of this disposition of his, and of the complaints which he made of not being advanced according to his deserts in England, in such a manner, that he did not scruple to go over to the Popish religion, as soon as he found that there was no ground to hope for greater encouragement in his own country. However that matter be, he joined himself to the Romish communion, but was disappointed in his expectations. He was soon displeased at this; and he could not reconcile himself to the discipline of that church, which made no consideration of the degrees which he had taken before. It is probable too that he could not approve of the worship of creatures, which Protestants are used to look upon with horror. Upon this he returned to England, in order to resume his former religion. He obtained a prebend in the cathedral of St Paul, and after that the rectory of Therfield in Hertfordshire. He was well skilled in the Hebrew tongue; but he gave a wrong turn to his genius by studying the Cabala, with which he was strangely infatuated. He gave a proof of this in a sermon which he preached upon taking his degree of doctor of divinity at Cambridge. He took for his text the beginning of the first book of Chronicles, Adam, Seth, Enos; and having touched upon the literal sense, he turned immediately to the mystical, asserting, that Alabaster Adam signified misfortune and misery, and so of the rest. His verses were greatly esteemed. He wrote a Latin tragedy intitled Roxana; which, when it was acted in a college at Cambridge, was attended with a very remarkable accident. There was a lady who was so terrified at the last word of the tragedy, Sequar, Sequar, which was pronounced with a very shocking tone, that she lost her senses all her lifetime after. He died in the year 1640. His Apparatus in Revelationem Iesu Christi was printed at Antwerp in 1607. His Spira-culum tubarum, seu fons Spiritualium Expositionum ex aquaequos Pentaglotis significativus, and his Ecce Sponsus venit, seu taba pulchritudinis, hoc est demonstratis quod non fit illucem nec impaffibile computare durationem mundi et tempus secundi adventus Christi, were printed at London. From these titles we may judge what were the taste and genius of the author.\n\nALABASTER, in Natural History, a mineral substance whose base is calcareous earth. It differs from marble in being combined, not with the carbonic, but with the sulphuric acid. See Chemistry, and Mineralogy Index.\n\nALABASTER, in Antiquity, a term used for a vase wherein odoriferous liquors were anciently put. The reason of the denomination is, that vessels for this purpose were frequently made of the alabaster stone, which Pliny and other ancients represent as peculiarly proper for this purpose. Several critics will have the box mentioned in the Gospels as made of alabaster to have been of glass: And though the texts say that the woman broke it, yet the pieces seem miraculously to have been united, since we are told the entire box was purchased by the emperor Constantine, and preserved as a relic of great price. Others will have it, that the name alabaster denotes the form rather than the matter of this box: In this view they define alabaster by a box without a handle, deriving the word from the primitive αλαβαστρον, αλαβαστρον, handle.\n\nALABASTER, is also said to have been used for an ancient liquid measure, containing ten ounces of wine, or nine of oil. In this sense, the alabaster was equal to half the sextary.\n\nALABASTRUM DENDROIDE, a kind of laminated alabaster, beautifully variegated with the figures of shrubs, trees, &c., found in great abundance in the province of Hohenstein.\n\nALADINISTS, a sect among the Mahometans, answering to freethinkers among us.\n\nALADULIA, a considerable province of Turkey in Asia, in that part called Natolia, between the mountains of Antitaurus, which separate it from Amaia on the north, and from Carmania on the west. It has the Mediterranean sea on the south; and the Euphrates, or Frat, on the east, which divides it from Diarbeker. It comprehends the Lesser Armenia of the ancients, and the east part of Cilicia. Formerly it had kings of its own; but the head of the last king was cut off by Selim I., emperor of the Turks, who had conquered the country. It is now divided into two parts: the north, comprehended between Taurus, Antitaurus, and the Euphrates, is a beglerbeglic, which bears the name of Marath, the capital town; and the south, seated between Mount Taurus and the Mediterranean, is united to the beglerbeglic of Aleppo. The country is rough, rugged,\nrugged, and mountainous; yet there are good pastures, and plenty of horses and camels. The people are hardy and thievish. The capital is Malatigah.\n\nALAIN, Chartier, secretary to Charles VII, king of France, born in the year 1386. He was the author of several works in prose and verse; but his most famous performance was his Chronicle of King Charles VII. Bernard de Girard, in his preface to the History of France, styles him \"an excellent historian, who has given an account of all the affairs, particulars, ceremonies, speeches, answers, and circumstances, at which he was present himself, or had information of.\" Giles Coroxet tells us, that Margaret, daughter to the king of Scotland, and wife to the dauphin, passing once through a hall where Alain lay asleep, she stepped and kissed him before all the company who attended: some of them telling her, that it was strange she should kiss a man who had so few charms in his person, she replied, \"I did not kiss the man, but the mouth from whence proceeded so many excellent sayings, so many wise discourses, and so many elegant expressions.\"\n\nMr Fontenelle, among his Dialogues of the Dead, has one upon this incident, between the princess Margaret and Plato. Mr Paquier compares Alain to Seneca, on account of the great number of beautiful sentences interposed throughout his writings.\n\nALAIS, a considerable town of France, in the department of Gard, and formerly the province of Languedoc, situated on the river Gard, at the foot of the Cevennes. The Jesuits had a college in this place; and a fort was built here in 1689. It is 34 miles north of Montpelier, and 340 from Paris. E. Long. 4° 20'. N. Lat. 44° 8'.\n\nALAMAGAN, in Geography, one of the Ladrones or Marianne islands, in the Indian ocean, is situated in N. Lat. 18° 5', and E. Long. 146° 47'. It is of an irregular form, and about 12 miles in circumference. The land in some places of this island is pretty high, so that it may be seen at the distance of 12 or 14 leagues. Near the north end of the island there is a volcano which emitted an immense body of smoke in the year 1799, when it was visited by Captain Bals. The volcano is in a mountain close to the sea, rising above its level 1200 or 1300 feet. The high parts of the island are rugged and sterile. In the lower parts there is a profusion and luxuriance of vegetation. They abound with cocoa-nut trees, several kinds of stone fruit, and the melon or bread-tree of the Nicobar islands. Some small sugar canes, some banana trees, and one bread-fruit tree were discovered. Lizards, land-crabs, large partridges, quails, pigeons, owls, thrushes, and bullfinches, are numerous. But no fresh water, which was the object of Captain Bals's visit, could be found.\n\nALAMANDUS, Lewis, in French Aleman, archbishop of Arles, and cardinal of St Cecilia, was one of the greatest men of the fifteenth century. The cardinal presided in the council of Basil, which deposed Eugenius IV, and elected the antipope Felix V. He is much commended by Aeneas Sylvius, as a man extremely well formed for presiding in such assemblies, firm and vigorous, illustrious by his virtue, learned, and of an admirable memory in recapitulating all that the orators and disputants had said. One day, when he ranged against the superiority of the pope over the council, he distinguished himself in such an eminent Alamannic manner, that several persons went to kiss him, while others preferred even to kiss his robe. They extolled to the skies his abilities and genius, which had raised him, though a Frenchman, to a superiority over the Italians, notwithstanding all their natural subtlety and fineness. There is no need of asking, whether Pope Eugenius thundered against the president of a council which deposed him. He deprived him of all his dignities, and treated him as a son of iniquity. However, notwithstanding this, Lewis Alamandus died in the odour of sanctity, and performed so many miracles after his death, that at the request of the canons and Celestine monks of Avignon, and the solicitation of the cardinal of Clermont, legate a latere of Clement VII, he was beatified by the pope in the year 1527.\n\nALAMANNI, Lewis, was born at Florence, of a noble family, on the 28th of October 1495. He was obliged to fly his country for a conspiracy against Julius de Medici, who was soon after chosen pope under the name of Clement VII. During this voluntary banishment, he went into France; where Francis I, from a love to his genius and merit, became his patron. This prince employed him in several important affairs, and honoured him with the collar of the order of St Michael. About the year 1540, he was admitted a member of the Inflammati, an academy newly created at Padua, chiefly by Daniel Barbaro and Ugolin Martelli. After the death of Francis, Henry duke of Orleans, who succeeded him in 1537, showed no less favour to Alamanni; and in the year 1551, sent him as his ambassador to Genoa: this was his last journey to Italy; and being returned to France, he died at Amboise on the 18th of April 1556, being in the 61st year of his age. He left many beautiful poems, and other valuable performances, in the Italian language. We have also some notes of his upon Homer's Iliad and Odyssey; those upon the Iliad were printed in the Cambridge edition of Homer in 1689, and Joshua Barnes has also inserted them in his fine edition of Homer in 1711.\n\nALAMODALITY, in a general sense, is the accommodating a person's behaviour, dress, and actions, to the prevailing taste of the country or times in which he lives.\n\nALAMODALITY of writing, is defined the accommodation of mental productions, both as to the choice of subject and the manner of treating it, to the genius or taste of the times, in order to render them more acceptable to the readers.\n\nALAMODE, a phrase originally French, importing a thing to be in the fashion or mode. The phrase has been adopted not only into several of the living languages, as the English and High-Dutch, but some have even taken it into the Latin. Hence we meet with Alamodicus and Alamodalias.\n\nALAMODE, in Commerce, a thin glossy black silk, chiefly used for women's hoods and men's mourning scarfs.\n\nALAMOS, Balthasar, a Spanish writer, born at Medina del Campo in Castile. After having studied the law at Salamanca, he entered into the service of Anthony Perez, secretary of state under Philip II. He was in high esteem and confidence with his master, upon which account he was imprisoned after the disgrace\nof this minister. He was kept in confinement 11 years, when Philip III. coming to the throne, set him at liberty, according to the orders given by his father in his will. Alamos continued in a private capacity, till the duke of Olivarez, the favourite of Philip IV., called him to public employments. He was a man of wit as well as judgment, but his pen was superior to his tongue. He died in the 88th year of his age. His Spanish translation of Tacitus, and the aphorisms which he added in the margin, gained him great reputation. This work was published at Madrid in 1614; and was to have been followed, as mentioned in the king's privilege, with a commentary, which however has never yet appeared. The author composed the whole during his imprisonment.\n\nALAN, Cardinal William, was born at Rossall in Lancashire, in the year 1532. He went to Oxford at the age of 15, and in 1550 was elected fellow of Oriel college. In 1556, being then only 24 years old, he was chosen principal of St Mary's hall, and one of the proctors of the university. In 1558 he was made canon of York; but, upon Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, he left England, and settled at Louvain in an English college, of which he became the chief support. In 1565 he visited his native country; but, on account of his extreme activity in the propagation of the Roman Catholic religion, he was obliged to fly the kingdom in 1568. He went first to Mechlin, and then to Douay, where he was made doctor of divinity. Soon after, he was appointed canon of Cambrai, and then canon of Rheims. He was created cardinal on the 28th of July 1587, by the title of St Martin in Montibus; and obtained from the king of Spain a rich abbey in the kingdom of Naples, and afterwards the bishopric of Mechlin. It is supposed to have been by the advice and instigation of this priest, that Philip II. attempted to invade England. He died on the 20th of October 1594, aged 63; and was buried in the English college at Rome. He was a man of considerable learning, and an elegant writer. He wrote many books in defence of the Romish religion. The most remarkable are, 1. A defense of the 12 martyrs in one year. Tho. Alfstead was hanged for bringing, and publishing, this and other Alan's works, into England, in the year 1584. 2. A declaration of the sentence of Sextus V. &c. A work intended to explain the pope's bull for the excommunication of Queen Elizabeth, and to exhort the people of England to take up arms in favour of the Spaniards. Many thousand copies of this book, printed at Antwerp, were put on board the Armada; but the enterprise failing, they were afterwards destroyed. 3. Of the worship due to saints and their relics 1583. This treatise was answered by Lord Burleigh, and is esteemed the most elegant of the cardinal's writings.\n\nALAND, in Geography, with its dependent islands, to the number of eighty, is situated between the gulfs of Bothnia and Finland. These islands lie between N. Lat. 59° 47' and 60° 30', and between E. Long. 19° 17' and 22° 7'. Aland constitutes the smallest of the possessions belonging to the crown of Sweden. It contains about seventy-seven square English miles, and is in length about twenty English miles, and fifteen in breadth.\n\nAland has been supposed anciently to have been governed by its own monarchs; it is certain, however, that since the fourteenth century it has made part of the bishoprick and government of Abo, with the exception that in the year 1743 Aland and the other islands submitted to Ruffia, and swore allegiance to the czarina, but were soon after restored to Sweden by the treaty of Abo. These islands in former times frequently suffered from the invasions of the Ruffians, and the inhabitants had been forced to fly from their houses and fertile plains. But in 1718 a congress was held here for the restoration of peace, by which the enjoyment of tranquillity was secured to them.\n\nAland and the several isles contain eight parishes, each of which has a church; and besides these places of worship, there are seven chapels.\n\nThe Laplanders and Fins were undoubtedly the earliest inhabitants of these islands, and their residence here is plainly to be traced in the names of places which still remain.\n\nSeveral lakes are met with in these islands, and but one rivulet, which however is sufficient to work two mills, one of which is a saw-mill. The mountains are numerous; the highest of them is called Ulfdubs Klint.\n\nThe revenues which the crown of Sweden receives from Aland and the other islands, amount annually to nineteen thousand nine hundred and eighty-five rix-dollars. Two hundred and ninety-eight fallers are registered in these islands, which cost the king of Sweden about five thousand rix-dollars yearly.\n\nAland contains about three thousand seven hundred and fifty acres of land in cultivation, which produce rye, wheat, oats, and barley, in the proportion of seven for one. The annual growth of wheat is about twenty-two thousand five hundred barrels. There is one parish, which has no arable land, and in this respect resembles Lapland. The inhabitants of this parish employ themselves in fishing, and purchase all the corn they have occasion for of their neighbours. They catch vast numbers of pilchards, of which they make great profit, it being the chief traffic of these islands.\n\nIt has been in agitation to build a city in the isle of Aland, but the project has not hitherto been carried into execution, owing it is said, to the difficulty of choosing a proper spot for it.\n\nThe usual route from Sweden to Finland is from the post office of Grillehamn in Uppland, which is eleven and a half Swedish miles, to Eckero in Aland; and from that place across the island to Abo, which is five miles more. A Swedish mile makes between six and seven English miles.\n\nIn the year 1792 the number of inhabitants upon the island of Aland amounted to eleven thousand two hundred and sixty, which is upwards of a thousand to every square Swedish mile; a very great number when it is considered how mountainous the island is. The inhabitants of these islands live to very great ages. From the year 1692 to the present time, nine persons are recorded to have died at the great age of one hundred years; and perhaps the number had been found greater, had it been thought worthwhile to notice this particular. In 1703 there died a woman named Anna Berg, who was one hundred and nine years old; and at Kumlinge, in the year 1766, another person of the same sex died at an age of upwards of one hundred and twenty years. One fifth part of the inhabitants are above fifty years old;\nold; a circumstance which affords a convincing proof of the healthiness of the place.\n\nThe sea which surrounds the isle of Aland is very seldom frozen, and was less so formerly than at the present time. In 1546 it was remarked as an extraordinary event, that in that year the sea was so frozen as to be crossed on the ice. It seems latterly that these severe frosts happened once in ten years. The winter of the year 1702 was remarkably mild, so that barley was sown on the twenty-fifth of March, at which time there was plenty of pasture for cattle: considering its high latitude, Aland enjoys a very favourable climate.\n\nIn their manners and customs the inhabitants of Aland do not differ greatly from the peasants of Up-land. Their marriages and funerals are celebrated much in the same manner.\n\nThe Alanders commonly use nourishing food; their bread is generally made of rye, even when the crops of that kind of corn have proved unfavourable. Fresh fish, and fish dried or salted, together with milk, butter, cheese, and flesh-meat, are their usual fare. They make use of the flesh of seals, and prepare a dish called *fiskbroppa*, composed of collops of the flesh mixed up with flour and lard, and this they reckon excellent. In their voyages by sea they lay in a good stock of provisions, and at those times are not sparing of meat and butter.\n\nThe dress of the Alanders is becoming. The men wear, in general, short jackets which on holidays are commonly of blue cloth. The young peasants commonly wear cotton stockings, and many of them have even watches. The women, when full dressed, wear a petticoat and apron of camlet, cotton, or printed linen, and sometimes of silk. Their dress in mourning is generally of black silk, with a camlet petticoat.\n\nThe dwellings of the peasants are very neat and convenient, kept in good repair, and well lighted. They are usually built of wood, fir, or deal, and covered with the bark of the birch tree, or shingles. Their out-houses are mostly thatched. As they have no running streams and water-mills, scarcely any peasant is without a windmill.\n\nThe Alanders are an ingenious, lively, and courteous people; and on the sea display a great degree of skill and resolution. They are far from being superstitious, but are said to be of a litigious disposition.\n\nNo bears or squirrels are to be found in these islands; and the elk, which formerly was uncommonly numerous, is now no longer seen in them. The animals chiefly found are wolves, (which are said to cross the sea from Finland, when it has happened to be frozen over) foxes, martens, hares, ermines, bats, moles, rats, mice, &c.; otters are but rarely met with: on the coast are found seals, &c. Above a hundred species of birds are found in the islands. Fish are in great abundance. The number of insects amounts to eight hundred species, some of which are extremely destructive to trees and newly built houses. The mountains are chiefly formed of red granite. (Acerbi's Travels.)\n\n**ALARAF**, in the Mahometian Theology, the partition wall that separates heaven from hell. The word is plural, and properly written *al araf*; in the singular it is written *al arf*. It is derived from the Arabic verb *arafa*, to distinguish. Alaraf gives the denomination to the seventh chapter of the Alcoran, wherein mention is made of this wall. Mahomet seems to have copied his Alaraf, either from the great gulf of separation mentioned in the New Testament, or from the Jewish writers, who also speak of a thin wall dividing heaven from hell. Mahometian writers differ extremely as to the persons who are to be found on Alaraf. Some take it for a fort of limbus for the patriarchs, prophets, &c., others place here such whose good and evil works so exactly balance each other, that they deserve neither reward nor punishment. Others imagine this intermediate space to be possessed by those who, going to war without their parents leave, and suffering martyrdom there, are excluded paradise for their disobedience, yet escape hell because they are martyrs.\n\n**ALARBE**, a name given to those Arabians who live in tents, and distinguish themselves by their dress from the others who live in towns.\n\n**ALARES**, in Roman Antiquity, an epithet given to the cavalry, on account of their being placed in the two wings of the army.\n\n**ALARIC**, a famous general of the Goths. He entered Thrace at the head of 200,000 men, and laid waste all the country through which he passed. He marched next to Macedonia and Thessaly; the Thessalians met him near the mouth of the river Peneus, and killed about 3000 of his army; nevertheless he advanced into Greece, and after having ravaged the whole country, returned to Epirus, loaded with immense spoils. After staying here five years, he resolved to turn his arms to the west. He marched through Pannonia; and, finding little resistance, entered Italy, in the conduct of Stilicho and Aurelianus, A.D. 400. After various battles and treaties, he at last took Rome by treachery, and permitted his soldiers to plunder it; this happened A.D. 409. Alaric, having laid waste a great part of Italy, intended to pass into Sicily; but a storm obliging him to land again, he besieged the city of Cosenza; and having taken it, he died there in 411, eleven years after he first entered Italy.\n\n**ALARM**, in the Military Art, denotes either the apprehension of being suddenly attacked; or the notice thereof, signified by firing a cannon, firelock, or the like. False alarms are frequently made use of, to harass the enemy, by keeping them constantly under arms. Sometimes also this method is taken to try the vigilance of the piquet-guard, and what might be expected from them in case of real danger.\n\n**ALARM-Bell**, that rung upon any sudden emergency, as a fire, mutiny, or the like.\n\n**ALARM-POLE**, or **ALARM-place**, the ground for drawing up each regiment in case of an alarm. This is otherwise called the rendezvous.\n\n**ALARM**, in Fencing, is the same with what is otherwise called an appeal, or challenge.\n\n**ALASCANI**, in Church History, a sect of Antithenians, whose distinguishing tenet, besides their denying baptism, is said to have been this, that the words, *This is my body*, in the institution of the eucharist, are not to be understood of the bread, but of the whole action, or celebration of the supper. They are said to have taken the name from one Joannes Alasco, a Polish baron, superintendent of the church of that country, in England. See the next article.\n\n**ALASCO**, John, a Polish nobleman of the 16th century,\nAlatamaha century, who, imbibing the reformed opinions, was expelled his country, and became preacher to a Protestant congregation at Embleton; but foreseeing persecution there, came to England about the year 1551, while the reformation was carrying on under Edward the VI. The publication of the Interim driving the Protestants to such places as afforded them toleration, 380 were naturalized here, and obtained a charter of incorporation, by which they were erected into an ecclesiastical establishment, independent on the church of England. The Augustinian friars church was granted them, with the revenues, for the maintenance of Alasco as superintendent, with four assistant ministers, who were to be approved by the king; and this congregation lived undisturbed until the accession of Queen Mary, when they were all sent away. They were kindly received and permitted to settle at Embleton; and Alasco at last, after an absence of 20 years, by the favour of Sigismund, returned to his own country, where he died in 1560. Alasco was much esteemed by Erasmus, and the historians of his time speak greatly in his praise; we have of his writing, De Cena Domini liber; Epistolae continens Summam Controversiae de Cena Domini, &c. He had some particular tenets; and his followers are called Alascani in church-history.\n\nALATAMAH, a large river of North America, which, rising in the Appalachian mountains, runs southeast through the province of Georgia, and falls into the Atlantic ocean, below the town of Frederica.\n\nALATERNUS, in Botany, the trivial name of a species of the rhamnus. See Rhamnus, Botany Index.\n\nALAVA, a district of Spain, about 20 miles in length, and 17 in breadth, containing very good iron mines. Victoria is the capital town.\n\nALAUDA, or LARK, see Ornithology Index.\n\nALAUTA, a considerable river of Turkey in Europe, which, after watering the north-east part of Transylvania and part of Wallachia, falls into the Danube almost opposite to Nicopolis.\n\nALAY, signifying in the Turkish language \"The Triumph,\" a ceremony which accompanies the assembling together of the forces of that vast empire upon the breaking out of a war. It consists of the most splendid festivity, and is attended with acts of the most shocking barbarity. That which took place upon occasion of the late war between the Porte and Russia is described by Baron Tott in his Memoirs as follows:\n\n\"It consists in a kind of masquerade, in which each trade successively pretends to the spectators the mechanical exercise of its respective art. The labourer draws his plough, the weaver handles his shuttle, the joiner his plane; and these different characters, seated in cars richly ornamented, commence the procession, and precede the standard of Mahomet, when it is brought out of the feraglio to be carried to the army, in order to insure victory to the Ottoman troops.\n\n\"This banner of the Turks, which they name Sandjak-Cherif, or The Standard of the Prophet, is so revered among them, that notwithstanding its reputation has been so often tarnished, it still retains their implicit confidence, and is the sacred signal unto which they rally. Every thing proclaims its sanctity. None but the emirs are allowed to touch it; they are its guards, and it is carried by their chief. The Muslims alone are permitted to look upon it. If touched by other hands, it would be defiled; if seen by other eyes, profaned. In short, it is encompassed by the most barbarous fanaticism.\n\n\"A long peace had unfortunately caused the ridiculousness, and especially the danger, of this ceremony to be forgotten. The Christians imprudently crowded to see it; and the Turks, who, by the situation of their houses, could make money of their windows, began to profit by the advantage; when an emir, who preceded the banner, proclaimed with a loud voice,\n\n'Let no infidel dare to profane with his presence the holy standard of the prophet; and let every Mussulman who perceives an unbeliever make it known under pain of reprobation.'\n\n\"From that moment no asylum was to be found; even those became informers, who, by letting out their houses, had rendered themselves accomplices in the crime. A religious fury seized on every mind, and put arms in every hand; the more atrocious the cruelty, the more was it meritorious. No regard was paid to sex or age; pregnant women, dragged by the hair, and trodden under feet by the multitude, perished in the most deplorable manner. Nothing was respected by these monsters; and under such auspices the Turks commenced the war.\"\n\nALB, or ALBE, in the Roman Church, a vestment of white linen hanging down to the feet, and answering to the surplice of the English clergy. In the ancient church, it was usual, with those newly baptized, to wear an alb, or white vestment; and hence the Sunday after Easter was called dominica in albis, on account of the albs worn by those baptized on Easter-day.\n\nALB, is also a name of a Turkish coin, otherwise called aper. See Asper.\n\nALBA, in Ancient Geography, a town of the Marsi in Italy, situated on the north side of the Lacus Fucinus, still retaining its name. It stands upon an eminence, and is noted in Roman history for being the state prison where captive princes were shut up, after being barbarously dragged through the streets of Rome at the chariot wheels of a triumphant consul. Perseus king of Macedon terminated his wretched career in this confinement, with his son, the last hope of an illustrious line of kings. Syphax the Numidian, and Bithynius king of the Avernii, were also condemned to this gaol by the particular clemency of the senate, which sometimes indulged its savage disposition by putting its captives to death.\n\nAlba being situated in the centre of Italy, amidst difficult mountainous passes, and far from all means of escape, was esteemed a most proper place for the purpose of guarding prisoners of importance. Artificial strength was added to its natural security by fortifications, which remain to this day in a state that proves their ancient solidity. For the entertainment of the garrison, which was required in a place of such consequence, an amphitheatre was erected, of which the ruins are still valuable, as well as the foundations of a temple, and other buildings of Roman times.\n\nLucius Vitellius, brother to the emperor of that name, had a villa near this place, famous for the variety and excellence of its fruit trees, which he had brought from Syria. His gardens were the nurseries where several of the most delicious stone-fruits, that are now so common.\nmon in Europe, were first cultivated and multiplied. It must have been necessary at Alba to shelter trees transplanted from Asia, and to treat them with great tenderness and care, in order to rear them to perfection: for the climate of this high region is extremely rigorous in winter; the cold season lasts long, and is accompanied with violent storms of wind and falls of snow. The lake has been often frozen entirely over.\n\nALBA FIRNA, or Album, in our Old Customs, denoted rent paid in silver, and not in corn, which was called black-mail.\n\nALBA TERRA, one of the numerous names for the philosopher's stone.\n\nALBA REGALIS. See STUHL WEISSENBURGH.\n\nALBA HELVORUM, or Albaugeta, in Ancient Geography, afterwards called Vivarium, now Viviers, in the south-east of Languedoc, on the Rhone. In the lower age the inhabitants were called Albenesi, and their city Civitas Albenesium, in the Notitia Galliae. E. Long. 4. 43. Lat. 44. 50.\n\nALBA JULIA, in Ancient Geography, now Weißenburg, a town of Transylvania, on the river Maritius, or Mecritus, to the west of Hermantat, supposed to be called Alba Julia, after Julia Domna the mother of Caracalla. There are, however, several inscriptions found at or near Weißenburg, which bear COL APUL, that is Colonia Apulensis, without the least mention of Alba julia, though inscribed after Caracalla's time. Add, that Ulpius, reciting the colonies of Dacia, calls this colony Apulensis, and neither Alba nor Julia. Whence there is a suspicion, that Alba Julia is a corruption of Apulum. It was also called Apulum Augustum. E. Long. 25. o. Lat. 46. 46.\n\nALBA LONGA, in Ancient Geography, a colony from Lavinium, in Latium, established by Alcænus the son of Æneas, at the foot of the Mons Albanus: called Alba, from a white sow found by Æneas, which farrowed 30 white pigs on that spot; which circumstance was interpreted to portend the building of a city there in 30 years after (Propertius). The epithet Longa was added on account of its length. It was the royal residence till the building of Rome, as was foretold by Anchises (Virgil); was destroyed by Tullius Hostilius, all but the fan or temple; and the inhabitants were transplanted to Rome (Strabo).\n\nALBA POMPEIA, in Ancient Geography, on the river Ceba, now Ceva, in Liguria, the birth-place of the emperor Pertinax; a colony either established at first by Pompey, or re-established by him after having been before settled by Scipio. The inhabitants were called Albenesi Pompeiani. At this day the town is simply called Alba, without any epithet.\n\nALBAHURIM, figura sedecim laterum, a figure of great importance according to astrological physicians, who built their prognostics on it.\n\nALBAN, St., is said to have been the first person who suffered martyrdom for Christianity in Britain; he is therefore usually styled the protomartyr of this island. He was born at Verulam, and flourished towards the end of the third century. In his youth he took a journey to Rome, in company with Amphibalus a monk of Caerleon, and served seven years as a soldier under the emperor Diocletian. At his return home, he settled in Verulam; and, through the example and instructions of Amphibalus, renounced the errors of Paganism, in which he had been educated, and became a convert to the Christian religion. It is generally agreed, that Alban suffered martyrdom during the great persecution under the reign of Diocletian; but authors differ as to the year when it happened: Bede and others fix it in 286; some refer it to the year 296; but Usher reckons it amongst the events of 303. The story and circumstances relating to his martyrdom, according to Bede, are as follows. Being yet a Pagan (or at least it not being known that he was a Christian), he entertained Amphibalus in his house. The Roman governor being informed thereof, sent a party of soldiers to apprehend Amphibalus; but Alban, putting on the habit of his guest, presented himself in his stead, and was carried before that magistrate. The governor having asked him of what family he was? Alban replied, \"To what purpose do you inquire of my family? if you would know my religion, I am a Christian.\" Then being asked his name, he answered, \"My name is Alban; and I worship the only true and living God, who created all things.\" The magistrate replied, \"If you would enjoy the happiness of eternal life, delay not to sacrifice to the great gods.\" Alban answered, \"The sacrifices you offer are made to devils; neither can they help the needy, or grant the petitions of their votaries.\" His behaviour so enraged the governor, that he ordered him immediately to be beheaded. In his way to execution, he was stopped by a river, over which was a bridge so thronged with spectators that it was impossible to cross it; the saint, as we are told, lifted up his eyes to heaven, and the stream was miraculously divided, and afforded a passage for himself and a thousand more persons. Bede does not indeed give us the name of this river; but, notwithstanding this omission, the miracle, we suppose, will not be the least believed. This wonderful event converted the executioner upon the spot, who threw away his drawn sword, and, falling at St Alban's feet, desired he might have the honour to die with him. This sudden conversion of the headman occasioning a delay in the execution till another person could be got to perform the office, St Alban walked up to a neighbouring hill, where he prayed for water to quench his thirst, and a fountain of water sprung up under his feet; here he was beheaded, on the 23rd of June. The executioner is said to have been a signal example of divine vengeance; for as soon as he gave the fatal stroke, his eyes dropt out of his head. We may see the opinion on Mr Milton in regard to this narrative, in his History of England. His words are these, speaking of St Alban: \"The story of whose martyrdom, foiled and worse martyred with the fabling zeal of some idle fancies, more fond of miracles than apprehensive of the truth, deserves no longer digression.\" Between 400 and 500 years after St Alban's death, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a very large and stately monastery to his memory; and the town of St Albans in Hertfordshire takes its name from our protomartyr.\n\nALBANA, in Ancient Geography, a sea-port town of Albania, on the Calpian sea, between the rivers Catus and Albanus; now called Bachu, or Bachy, giving name to the Calpian sea, viz. Mer de Babu. E. Long. 49. o. N. Lat. 40. o.\n\nALBANENSES, in Church History, the same with Albigenes. See ALBIGENSES.\nALBANI, in Roman Antiquity, a college of the Salii, or priests of Mars; so called from Mount Albanus, the place of their residence. See SALLI.\n\nALBANI, Francis, a celebrated painter, born in Bologna, March 17, 1578. His father was a silk merchant, and intended to bring up his son to that business; but Albani having a strong inclination to painting, when his father died, devoted himself entirely to that art, though then but twelve years of age. He first studied under Denys Calvert; Guido Rheni being at the same time under this master, with whom Albani contracted a very great friendship. Calvert drew but one profile for Albani, and afterwards left him entirely to the care of Guido; under whom he made great improvement, his fellow-disciple instructing him with the utmost humanity and good humour. He followed Guido to the school of the Caracci; but a little after their friendship for each other began to cool; which was owing perhaps to the pride of Albani, who could not bear to see Guido surpass him, or to the jealousy of Guido at finding Albani make such rapid progress. They certainly endeavoured to eclipse one another; for when Guido had let up a beautiful altar-piece, Albani would oppose to it some fine picture of his; thus did they behave for some time, and yet spoke of each other with the highest esteem. Albani, after having greatly improved himself under the Caracci, went to Rome, where he continued many years, and married in that city; but his wife dying in childbed, at the earnest request of his relations he returned to Bologna, where he entered again into the state of matrimony. His second wife (Doralice) was well defended, but had very little fortune; which he perfectly disregarded, so strongly was he captivated by her beauty and good sense. Albani, besides the satisfaction of possessing an accomplished wife, reaped likewise the advantage of having a most beautiful model; so that he had now no occasion to make use of any other woman to paint a Venus, the Graces, Nymphs, and other deities, whom he took a particular delight in representing. His wife answered this purpose admirably well; for besides her bloom of youth, and the beauty of her person, he discovered in her so much modesty, so many graces and perfections, so well adapted to painting, that it was impossible for him to meet with a more refined woman. She afterwards brought him several boys, all extremely beautiful and finely proportioned; so that she and her children were the originals of his most agreeable and graceful compositions. Doralice was so conformable to his intentions, that she took a pleasure in setting the children in different attitudes, holding them naked, and sometimes suspended by strings, when Albani would draw them in a thousand different ways. It was from them, too, that the famous sculptors Flamand and Argaldi modelled their little Cupids.\n\nAlbani was of a happy temper and disposition; his paintings, says Malvasia, breathing nothing but content and joy. Happy in a force of mind that conquered every uneasiness, his poetical pencil carried him through the most agreeable gardens to Paphos and Cythera; those delightful scenes brought him over the lofty Parnassus to the delicious abodes of Apollo and the Muses; whence what Du Fresnoy says of the famous Giulio Romano may be justly applied to Albani:\n\nTaught from a child in the bright Muses' grots,\nHe open'd all the treasures of Parnassus,\nAnd in the lovely poetry of painting\nThe mysteries of Apollo has reveal'd.\n\nHe died the 4th of October 1660, to the great grief of all his friends and the whole city of Bologna. Malvasia has preserved some verses of Francifco de Leme, intended for his monument; the sense whereof is,\n\n\"That the mortal remains of the illustrious Albani, he who gave life to shade, lie interred in this tomb; the earth never produced so wonderful an artist, or a hand equal to his immortal one; which gave colours to the soul, and a soul to colours. Prometheus animated clay, and gave life by means of the sun; but Albani animated merely by the assistance of shade.\"\n\nHe was very famous in his lifetime, and had been visited by the greatest painters. Several princes honoured him with letters; and amongst the rest King Charles I., who invited him to England by a letter signed with his own hand.\n\nALBANIA, a province of Turkey in Europe, on the gulf of Venice, bounded by Livadia on the south, by Thessaly and Macedonia on the east, and on the north by Bosnia and Dalmatia. The people are strong, large, courageous, and good horsemen; but are said to be of a thieves disposition. The grand seignior procures excellent soldiers from hence, particularly cavalry, known by the name of Arnauts. There are several large towns in this province; and the inhabitants are almost all Christians of the Greek church, and descended from the ancient Scythians. Formerly it was part of the kingdom of Macedonia. Their chief manufacture is carpets. The principal places are Durazzo, Velona, Antivari, Scutari, Croya, Alessio, Dibra, Dolcigno, and Albanapolis. Long. from 18° to 21° E. Lat. from 39° to 43° N.\n\nALBANIA, a country of Asia, bounded on the west by Iberia; on the east by the Caspian sea; on the north by Mount Caucasus; on the south by Armenia, and the river Cyrus, now Kur; which, springing from the Mochian mountains that separate Colchis from Armenia, and watering the country of Mokan, receives the Aragus and Araxes, and falls into the Caspian sea within a small distance from the southern borders of this country.—The whole country formerly called Albania, now goes under the names of Schirwan and Eoë-Georgia, and is extremely fruitful and pleasant. The ancient historians take notice of the Albanian men being tall, strong-bodied, and, generally speaking, of a very graceful appearance; far excelling all other nations in comeliness as well as stature. Modern travelers take no notice of the appearance of the men; but extol the beauty of the women, which seems to be unnoticed by the ancients. The Albanians were anciently an independent and pretty powerful people; but we find no mention made of their kings till the reign of Alexander the Great, to whom the king of Albania is said to have presented a dog of an extraordinary fierceness and size.—It does not appear that the Albanians were ever conquered by the Romans, even when their power was at the greatest height; though when they ventured to engage in war with that powerful empire, they were always defeated, as might naturally be expected.\n\nALBANO, a town of Italy, on a lake of the same name\nname, in the Campagna of Rome. It was called by the ancients Albanum Pompeii, and built out of the ruins of the ancient Alba Longa, which was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius. It stands within twelve miles south-east of Rome, and for the pleasantness of its situation is the summer retirement of a great many Roman princes. It is likewise the see of a bishop, who is one of the six senior cardinals. The town is famous for its excellent wine, and the ruins of a mausoleum, which, according to the tradition of the inhabitants, was made for Alcænus. The prospect from the garden of the Capuchins is extremely pleasant, taking in the Campania of Rome, and terminating in a full view of the Tuscan sea. Close by the town lies the Alban lake, of an oval figure, and about seven miles in circumference, which, by reason of the high mountains round it, looks like the area of a great amphitheatre. It abounds with excellent fish, and over against the hermitage it is said to be unfathomable. The mountain of Albano is called Monte Cavo; on the top of which was a celebrated temple dedicated to Jupiter and Juno. Near the Capuchins there is another convent of Franciscans; and not far from thence the palace of Cardinal Barberini, remarkable for very pleasant gardens, with the ruins of ancient baths, and several old fragments of mosaic work.\n\nE. Long. 13. 10. N. Lat. 41. 43.\n\nAlbano is also a town in the kingdom of Naples, remarkable for the fertility of the surrounding territory, and for the nobility of the inhabitants.\n\nALBANS, Saint, a market town of Hertfordshire, is a very great thoroughfare, accommodated with good inns, on the north-west road from London, at the distance of 21 miles. This town sends two members to parliament, gives the title of duke to the noble family of Beaucherc, and has one of the best markets for wheat in England. St Albans is seated near the ruins of an ancient Roman city, by Tacitus called Verulam; and by the Saxons Watlingcester, because it is seated on the road called Watlingstreet. Nothing now remains of Verulam but the ruins of old walls; in the fields adjacent to which they continue to find Roman coins, as they formerly found tessellated pavements. In memory of St Alban, Offa, king of the Mercians, anno 795, erected an abbey, calling it St Albans; and near it the town of the same name was afterwards built. The church of the abbey is remaining to this day; time and the weather have made it look like stone on the outside; but if you break a bit off, the redness of the brick immediately appears. When the monasteries were dissolved, the townsmen paid 400l. to prevent its being levelled with the ground, and have since converted it into a parish-church, which, for its largeness, beauty, and antiquity, claims a particular regard. It had a very noble font of solid brass, in which the children of the kings of Scotland were used to be baptized; and was brought from Edinburgh, by Sir Philip Lea, when the city was in flames; but in the times of the late civil wars, it was taken away. Not many years since, a tomb was discovered in this church, said to be that of Humphry duke of Gloucester: when the leaden coffin was opened, the body was pretty entire, being preserved in a sort of pickle. There was a stately cross in the middle of the town, as there were in many other places, where Queen Eleanor's body rested when it was brought out of the north for interment at Westminster; but it is now demolished.

W. Long. 84. 20. N. Lat. 53. 20.\n\nALBANY, a town of North America, the capital of one of the ten counties of the province of New-York, which goes by the same name, is a well-built place, conferring the country. Here the sachems, or the kings of the Five Nations of Iroquois, met the governors of the British plantations, when they entered into any treaty with them. W. Long. 44. 29. N. Lat. 42. 30.\n\nALBARAZIN, a strong town, and one of the most ancient of the kingdom of Arragon in Spain. It is seated upon an eminence, near the river Guadalquivir, a little below its source, and on the frontiers of Valencia and New Castile. It is the seat of a bishop, and produces the best wool in all Arragon. It is about 100 miles east of Madrid. E. Long. 2. 10. N. Lat. 40. 32.\n\nALBARI, in Antiquity, properly denoted those who gave the whitening to earthen vessels, &c. In which sense they stood contradistinguished from Dealbari, who whitened walls.\n\nALBARIUM OPUS, in the ancient building, the incrustation or covering of the roofs of houses with white plaster, made of mere lime. This is otherwise called opus album. It differs from Tectarium, which is a common name given to all roofing or ceiling, including even that formed of lime and sand, or lime and marble; whereas Albarium was restrained to that made of lime alone.\n\nALBATEGNI, an Arabic prince of Batan in Mesopotamia, and a celebrated astronomer, who lived about the year of Christ 880, as appears by his observations. He is also called Mubammed ben Geber, Albataani, Mahomet the son of Geber, and Mubamedes Arategenis. He made astronomical observations at Antioch, and at Racah or Arafa, a town of Chaldea. He is highly spoken of by Dr Halley as a man of admirable genius, and an excellent observer.\n\nInstead of the tables of Ptolemy which were imperfect, he computed new ones; these were adapted to the meridian of Arafa or Racah, and were long used as the best among the Arabs. Albategni composed in Arabic a work under the title of The Science of the Stars, comprising all parts of astronomy, according to his own observations and those of Ptolemy. This work was translated into Latin by Plato of Tibur, and published at Nuremberg in 1537, with some additions and demonstrations of Regiomontanus. It was reprinted at Bologna in 1645, with this author's notes. Dr Halley detected many faults in these editions: Philos. Trans. for 1693, No. 204. In this work, Albategni gives the motion of the sun's apogee since Ptolemy's time, as well as the motion of the stars, which he makes\nmakes one degree in 70 years. He made the longitude of the first star of Aries to be $18^\\circ 2'$; and the obliquity of the ecliptic $23^\\circ 35'$. Upon Albategni's observations were founded the Alphonsine tables of the moon's motions. *(Hutton's Math.

The ferges of this town are in high esteem. It is seated on the declivity of the sea, on the confines of Picardy, 35 miles north-east of Rouen, and 70 north-west of Paris. E. Long. 2. 21. N. Lat. 49. 50.\n\n**ALBEMARLE**, the most northern part of the province of North Carolina in America.\n\n**ALBENGUA**, a town of Italy, in the territory of Genoa. It is the see of a bishop; and is a very ancient handsome town, but not well peopled, on account of the infalibility of the air. It is seated in a very beautiful plain, which is well cultivated; and the outside of the town is surrounded with olive-trees. It is a sea-port, about 38 miles south-west of Genoa. E. Long. 8. 13. N. Lat. 44. 4.\n\n**ALBERNUO**, a kind of camlet, brought from the Levant by the way of Marfelles.\n\n**ALBERONI, JULIUS**, the son of a poor gardener in the suburbs of Placentia, born in 1664; who, by his great abilities and good fortune, rose from this low origin to the employment of first minister of state at the court of Spain, and to the dignity of cardinal. He routed that kingdom out of the lethargy it had sunk into for a century past; awakened the attention, and raised the affluence of all Europe, by his projects; one of which was to set the Pretender on the throne of Great Britain. He was at length deprived of his employment, and banished to Rome. He died in 1752, at the great age of 89. His *Testament Politique*, collected from his memoirs and letters, was published at Lausanne in 1753.\n\n**ALBERT**, Margrave of Brandenburg, and the last grand master of the Teutonic order, laid aside the habit of his order, embraced Lutheranism, and concluded a peace at Cracow in 1525, by which he was acknowledged duke of the east part of Prussia (formerly called for that reason *Ducal Prussia*), but to be held as a fief of Poland, and to descend to his male heirs. See Prussia.\n\n**ALBERTI, LEONE BATTISTA**, was descended from a noble family in Florence; and was perfectly acquainted with painting, sculpture, and architecture. He wrote of all three in Latin; but his studies did not permit him to leave any thing considerable behind him in painting. He was employed by Pope Nicholas V. in his buildings, which he executed in a beautiful manner; and his work on architecture, which consists of 10 books, is greatly esteemed. He also wrote some Alberti's treatises of morality, and a piece of arithmetic. He died in 1485.\n\n**ALBERTISTS**, a sect of scholastics, so named from their leader Albertus Magnus.\n\n**ALBERTUS MAGNUS**, a Dominican friar, and afterwards bishop of Ratishon, was one of the most learned men and most famous doctors of the 13th century. He is said to have acted as a man-midwife; and some have been highly offended that one of his profession should follow such an employment. A book entitled *De Natura Rerum*, of which he was reputed the author, gave rise to this report. In this treatise there are several instructions for midwives, and so much skill shown in their art, that one would think the author could not have arrived at it without having himself practised: but the advocates for Albert say he was not the writer thereof, nor of that other piece *De Secretis Mulierum*; in which there are many phrases and expressions unavoidable on such a subject, which gave great offence, and raised a clamour against the supposed author. It must be acknowledged, however, that there are, in his Comment upon the Matter of Sentences, some questions concerning the practice of conjugal duty, in which he has used some words rather too gross for chaste and delicate ears; but they allege what he himself used to say in his own vindication, that he came to the knowledge of so many monstrous things at confession, that it was impossible to avoid touching upon such questions. Albert was certainly a man of a most curious and inquisitive turn of mind, which gave rise to other accusations brought against him. It is said, that he laboured to find out the philosopher's stone; that he was a magician; and that he made a machine in the shape of a man, which was an oracle to him, and explained all the difficulties he proposed. He had great knowledge in the mathematics, and by his skill in that science might probably have formed a head with springs capable of articulating sounds; like to the machines of Boetius, of which Caiusdorus has said, \"Metals lowe; the birds of Diomedes trumpet in brafs; the brazen serpent hisses; counterfeited swallows chatter, and such as have no proper note, from brafs send forth harmonious music.\" John Matthaeus de Luna, in his treatise *De Rerum Inventoribus*, has attributed the invention of fire-arms to Albert; but in this he is confuted by Naude, in his *Apologie des Grandes Hommes*. Albert died at Cologne in 1280. His works were printed at Lyons, in 1651, in 21 volumes in folio.\n\n**ALBERTUS**, a gold coin, worth about fourteen French livres: it was coined during the administration of Albertus archduke of Austria.\n\n**ALBESIA**, in Antiquity, a kind of shields otherwise called Decumana. See Decumana.\n\n**ALBI**, a city of France, in the department of the Tarn, the capital of the Albigensis, in Upper Languedoc. The cathedral is dedicated to St Cecilia, and has one of the finest choirs in the kingdom. Here is a very valuable silver shrine, of exquisite workmanship, of the mosaic kind: it contains the relics of St Clair, the first bishop of this city. The chapel of this pretended saint is magnificent, and adorned with paintings. The Lice is a fine large walk without the city: what distinguishes this from all others, is a terrace above\nAlbigenses, above a deep mall, which serves instead of a fossa; it is bordered with two rows of very fine trees, which are kept in excellent order. There are four gates, through which you may view all the beauties of a delightful plain. At one end of this is the convent of the Dominicans. The archbishop's palace is very beautiful. The river washes its walls, and serves both for an ornament and defense. This city is seated on the river Tarn, 35 miles north-east of Toulouse, and 250 south of Paris. E. Long. 2. 9. N. Lat. 43° 16'.\n\nThe Albigeois is a small territory about twenty-seven miles in length, and twenty in breadth, abounding in corn, wood, grapes, saffron, plums, and sheep; and the inhabitants have a great trade in dried prunes, grapes, a coarse sort of cloth, and wines of Gaillac. These wines are the only fort hereabouts that are fit for exportation: they are carried down to Bordeaux, and generally sold to the British. They have likewise several coal mines.\n\nALBIGENSES, in Church History, a sect or party of reformers, about Toulouse and the Albigeois in Languedoc, who sprung up in the 12th century, and distinguished themselves by their opposition to the discipline and ceremonies of the Roman church.\n\nThis fact had their name, it is supposed, either by reason there were great numbers of them in the diocese of Albi, or because they were condemned by a council held in that city. In effect, it does not appear that they were known by this name before the holding of that council. The Albigenses were also called Albani, Albigeosi, Albi, and Albanenses, though some distinguish these last from them. Other names given to them are, Henricians, Abelardists, Bulgarians, &c.; some on account of the qualities they assumed; others on that of the country from whence it is pretended they were derived; and others on account of persons of note who adopted their cause, as Peter de Bruis, Arnold de Bresse, Abelard, Henry, &c., Berengarius, if not Wickliff himself, is by some ranked in the number. The Albigenses are frequently confounded with the Waldenses; from whom, however, they differ in many respects, both as being prior to them in point of time, as having their origin in a different country, and as being charged with divers heresies, particularly Manicheism, from whence the Waldenses are exempt. But several Protestant writers have vindicated them from that imputation. Dr Allix shows that a great number of Manichaeans did spread over the western countries from Bulgaria; and settled in Italy, Languedoc, and other places, where they were also Albigenses; by which means, being both under the imputation of heresy, they came, either by ignorance or malice, to be confounded, and called by the same common name, though in reality entirely different.\n\nOther errors imputed to them by their opponents, the monks of those days, were, That they admitted two Christs; one evil, who appeared on earth; the other good, who has not yet appeared: That they denied the resurrection of the body; and maintained human souls to be demons imprisoned in our bodies, by way of punishment for their sins: That they condemned all the sacraments of the church; rejected baptism as useless; held the eucharist in abhorrence; excluded the use of confessions and penance; maintained marriage unlawful; laughed at purgatory; prayers for Albigenses, the dead, images, crucifixes, &c. There were likewise said to be two classes of them; the Perfect, and the Believers. The perfect boasted of their living in continence, of eating neither flesh, eggs, nor cheese. The believers lived like other men, and were even loose in their morals; but they were persuaded they should be saved by the faith of the perfect, and that none were damned who received imposition of hands from them. But from these charges also they are generally acquitted by Protestants; who consider them as the pious inventions of the Romish church, whose members deem it meritorious by any means to blacken heretics.\n\nHowever this be, the Albigenses grew so formidable, that the Catholics agreed upon a holy league or crusade against them. They were at first supported by Raymond, count of Toulouse. Pope Innocent III, furious to put a stop to their progress, sent a legate into their country; which failing, he stirred up Philip Augustus, king of France, and the other princes and great men of the kingdom, to make war upon them. Upon this the count of Toulouse, who had sided with them, made his submission to the pope, and went over to the Catholics; but soon after, finding himself plundered by the crusades, he declared war against them, and was joined by the king of Arragon. His army was defeated at the siege of Muret, where he himself was killed, and the defeat followed by the surrender of the city of Toulouse, and the conquest of the greatest part of Languedoc and Provence. His son Raymond succeeded him; who agreed with the king and the pope to set up the inquisition in his estates, and to extirpate the Albigenses. In an assembly held at Milan, the archbishop of Toulouse drew up articles agreeable to which the count made a most ample declaration against them, which he published at Toulouse in 1253. From this time the Albigenses dwindled by little and little, till the time of the Reformation; when such of them as were left fell in with the Vaudois, and became conformable to the doctrine of Zuinglius and the discipline of Geneva.\n\nALBIGENSES is also a name sometimes given to the followers of Peter Vaud, or Waldo; and hence synonymous with what we more properly call Waldenses, or Poor Men of Lyons. In this sense the word is applied by Camaratus, Thuanus, and several other writers. The reason seems to be, that the two parties agreed in their opposition to the papal innovations and encroachments, though in divers other respects said to be different enough. The bishop of Meaux labours hard to support a distinction between the two sects, alleging that the Albigenses were heretics and Manichaeans; whereas the Waldenses were only schismatics, not heretics; being found as to articles of faith, and only separating from the church of Rome on account of forms and discipline. Dr Allix endeavours to set aside the distinction: and shows, that both of them hold the same opinions, and were equally condemned and held for heretics; and this not for points of faith, but for declaring against the papal tyranny and idolatry, and holding the pope to be the Antichrist; which last, according to M. de Meaux, constitutes nothing less than Manicheism. In this sense the Lollards and Wickliffites in England were not only Albigenses but Manichaeans.\n\nALBINTEMELIUM.\nALBINTEMELIUM. Albintimilium, (Tacitus); or at full length, Alesium Intemelium, (Pliny, Strabo); now Vintimiglia, situated in the south-west of the territory of Genoa, near the borders of the county of Nice, with a port on the Mediterranean, at the mouth of the rivulet Rotta, about halfway between Monaco and S. Remo. E. Long. 7° 40' N. Lat. 43° 17'.\n\nALBIOECE, or ALBEOCE, (Pliny, Strabo); otherwise called Reii Apollinaris, from their superstitious worship of Apollo; also Civitas Reiensium; now Riez, in Provence, about 18 leagues to the north-east of Toulon, on the north side of the rivulet Verdon; was originally a Roman colony, (Inscription). It is sometimes written Regium. The people were called Albici, (Cæsar.) E. Long. 1° 0' N. Lat. 43° 20'.\n\nALBINI, in Antiquity, the workmen employed in what was called Opus Albarium. They make a different profession from the dealbatores or whiteners.\n\nALBINOS, the name by which the Portuguese call the white Moors, who are looked upon by the negroes as monsters. They at a distance might be taken for Europeans; but, when you come near them, their white colour appears like that of persons affected with a leprosy.\n\nIn Saufure's Voyages dans les Alpes, is the following account of two boys, at Chamouni, who have been called Albinos. \"The elder, who was at the end of the year 1785 about twenty, or one-and-twenty years of age, had a dull look, with lips somewhat thick, but nothing else in his features to distinguish him from other people. The other, who is two years younger, is rather a more agreeable figure; he is gay and sprightly, and seems not to want wit. But their eyes are not blue; the iris is of a very distinct rose colour; the pupil too, when viewed in the light, seems decidedly red; which seems to demonstrate, that the interior membranes are deprived of the uvea, and of that black mucous matter that should line them. Their hair, their eye-brows, and eye-lashes, the down upon their skin, were all, in their infancy, of the most perfect milk-white colour, and very fine; but their hair is now of a reddish cast, and has grown pretty strong. Their sight too is somewhat strengthened; though they exaggerate to strangers their aversion for the light, and half shut the eye-lids, to give themselves a more extraordinary appearance. But those who, like me, have seen them in their infancy, before they were tutored to this deceit, and when too few people came to Chamouni to make this affectation profitable to them, can attest that then they were not very much offended with the light of day. At that time they were so little desirous of exciting the curiosity of strangers, that they hid themselves to avoid such; and it was necessary to do a sort of violence to them before they could be prevailed on to allow themselves to be inspected. It is also well known at Chamouni, that when they were of a proper age they were unable to tend the cattle like the other children at the same age; and that one of their uncles maintained them out of charity, at a time of life when others were capable of gaining a subsistence by their labour.\n\n\"I am therefore of opinion, that we may consider these two lads as true albinos; for if they have not the thick lips and flat noses of the white negroes, it is because they are albinos of Europe, not of Africa. This albinism affects the eyes, the complexion, and the colour of the hair; it even diminishes the strength, but does not alter the conformation of the features. Besides, there are certainly in this malady various degrees; some may have less strength, and be less able to endure the light: but these circumstances in those of Chamouni are marked with characters sufficiently strong to entitle them to the unhappy advantage of being clasped with that variety of the human species denominated albinos.\n\n\"When nature presents the same appearance often, and with circumstances varied, we may at last discover some general law, or some relation which that appearance has with known causes: but when a fact is so singular and so rare, as that of those albinos, it gives but little scope to conjecture: and it is very difficult to verify those by which we attempt to explain it.\n\n\"I at first imagined that this disease might be referred to a particular sort of organic debility; that a relaxation of the lymphatic vessels within the eye might suffer the globules of the blood to enter too abundantly into the iris, the uvea, and even into the retina, which might occasion the redness of the iris and of the pupil. The same debility seemed also to account for the intolerance of the light, and for the whiteness of the hair.\n\n\"But a learned physiologist, M. Blumenbach, professor in the university at Göttingen, who has made many profound observations on the organs of sight, and has considered with great attention the albinos of Chamouni, attributes their infirmity to a different cause.\n\n\"The study of comparative anatomy has furnished him with frequent opportunities of observing this phenomenon; he has found it in brutes, in white dogs, and in owls; he says, it is generally to be seen in the warm-blooded animals; but that he has never met with it in those with cold blood.\n\n\"From his observations, he is of opinion, that the redness of the iris, and of the other internal parts of the eye, as well as the extreme sensibility that accompanies this redness, is owing to the total privation of that brown or blackish mucus, which, about the fifth week after conception, covers all the interior parts of the eye in its sound state. He observes, that Simon Pontius, in his treatise de Coloribus Oculorum, long ago remarked, that in blue eyes the interior membranes were less abundantly provided with this black mucus, and were therefore more sensible to the action of light. This sensibility of blue eyes agrees very well, says M. Blumenbach, with northern people, during their long twilight; while, on the contrary, the deep black in the eyes of negroes enables them to support the splendour of the sunbeams in the torrid zone.\n\n\"As to the connexion between this red colour of the eyes and the whiteness of the skin and hair, the same learned physiologist says, that it is owing to a similarity of structure, confusus ex similitudine fatriciae. He affirms, that this black mucus is formed only in the delicate cellular substance, which has numerous blood-vessels contiguous to it, but contains no fat; like the inside of the eye, the skin of negroes, the spotted palate of several domestic animals, &c. And, lastly, he says,\"\nAlbinos says, that the colour of the hair generally corresponds with that of the iris. *Gazette litt. de Gottingue*, Oct. 1784.\n\n\"At the very time that M. Blumenbach was reading this memoir to the Royal Society of Gottingen, M. Buzzi, surgeon to the hospital at Milan, an eleve of the celebrated anatomist Moscati, published in the *Opuscoli Scelti de Milan*, 1784, tom. vii. p. 11, a very interesting memoir, in which he demonstrates by dissection what Blumenbach had only supposed.\n\n\"A peasant of about 30 years of age died in the hospital of Milan of a pulmonary disorder. His body, being exposed to view, was exceedingly remarkable by the uncommon whiteness of the skin, of the hair, of the beard, and of all the other covered parts of the body. M. Buzzi, who had long desired an opportunity of dissecting such a subject, immediately seized upon this. He found the iris of the eyes perfectly white, and the pupil of a rose colour. The eyes were dissected with the greatest possible care, and were found entirely destitute of that black membrane which anatomists call the *uvea*: it was not to be seen either behind the iris or under the retina. Within the eye there was only found the choroid coat extremely thin, and tinged of a pale red colour, by vessels filled with discoloured blood. What was more extraordinary, the skin, when detached from different parts of the body, seemed almost entirely deprived of the *rete mucosum*: maceration did not discover the least vestige of this, not even in the wrinkles of the abdomen, where it is most abundant and most visible.\n\n\"M. Buzzi likewise accounts for the whiteness of the skin and of the hair, from the absence of the *rete mucosum*, which, according to him, gives the colour to the cuticle, and to the hairs that are scattered over it. Among other proofs of this opinion, he alleges a well-known fact, that if the skin of the blackest horse be accidentally destroyed in any part of the body, the hairs that afterwards grow on that part are always white, because the *rete mucosum* which tinges those hairs is never regenerated with the skin.\n\n\"The proximate cause of the whiteness of albinos, and the colour of their eyes, seems therefore pretty evidently to depend on the absence of the *rete mucosum*: But what is the remote cause?\n\n\"In the first place, it seems probable that men affected with this infirmity form no distinct species, for they are produced from parents that have dark skins and black eyes. What is it then that destroys the *rete mucosum* in such persons? M. Buzzi relates a singular fact, which seems to throw some light on this subject.\n\n\"A woman of Milan, named Calcagni, had seven sons. The two eldest had brown hair, and black eyes; the three next had white skins, white hair, and red eyes; the two last resembled the two eldest. It was said that this woman, during the three pregnancies that produced the albinos, had a continual and immoderate appetite for milk, which she took in great quantities: but that when she was with child of the other four children, she had no such desire. It is not however ascertained, that this supernatural appetite was not itself the effect of a certain heat, or internal disease, which destroyed the *rete mucosum* in the children before they were born.\n\n\"The albinos of Chamouni are also the offspring of albinos' parents with dark skins and black eyes. They have three sisters by the same father and mother, who are also brunettes. One of them that I saw had the eyes of a dark brown, and the hair almost black. They are said, however, to be all afflicted with a weakness of sight. When the lads are married, it will be curious to observe how the eyes of their children will be formed. The experiment would be particularly decisive if they were married to women like themselves. But this faulty conformation seems to be more rare among women than among men; for the four of Milan, the two of Chamouni, the one described by Maupeuis, the one by Helvetius, and almost all the instances of these singular productions, have been of our sex. It is known, however, that there are races of men and women affected with this disease, and that these races perpetuate themselves in Guinea, in Java, at Panama, &c.\n\n\"Upon the whole, this degeneration does not seem to be owing to the air of the mountains; for though I have traversed the greatest part of the Alps, and the other mountains of Europe, these are the only individuals of the kind that ever I met with.\"\n\nALBINOVANUS, a Latin poet, whom Ovid surmised the Divine. There is now nothing of his extant, except an Elegy on Drusus, and another on the Death of Meceenas.\n\nALBINUS, Bernhard Siegfried, a celebrated physician and anatomist, was born of an illustrious family at Frankfort on the Oder in 1697. His father was then professor of the practice of medicine in the university of Frankfort; but in the year 1702 he repaired to Leyden, being nominated professor of anatomy and surgery in that university. Here his son had an opportunity of studying under the most eminent masters in Europe, who, from the singular abilities which he then displayed, had no difficulty in prognosticating his future eminence. But while he was distinguished in every branch of literature, his attention was particularly turned to anatomy and surgery. His peculiar attachment to these branches of knowledge gained him the intimate friendship of Ruysh and Rau, who at that time flourished in Leyden; and the latter, so justly celebrated as a lithotomist, is said to have seldom performed a capital operation without inviting him to be present. Having finished his studies at Leyden, he went to Paris, where he attended the lectures of Du Verney, Vaillant, and other celebrated professors. But he had scarce spent a year there, when he was invited by the curators of the university of Leyden, to be a lecturer in anatomy and surgery at that place. Though contrary to his own inclination, he complied with their request, and upon that occasion was created doctor of physic without any examination. Soon after, upon the death of his father, he was appointed to succeed him as professor of anatomy; and upon being admitted into that office on the 9th of November 1721, he delivered an oration, *De vera via ad fabriec humani corporis cognitionem ducente*; which was heard with universal approbation. In the capacity of a professor, he not only bestowed the greatest attention upon the instruction of the youth entrusted to his care, but in the improvement of the medical art. With this view, he published many important discoveries of his own; and by\nby elegant editions, turned the attention of physicians to works of merit, which might otherwise have been neglected. By these means his fame was soon extended over Europe; and the societies of London, Peterburgh, and Haarlem, cheerfully received him as an associate. In 1745, he was appointed professor of the practice of medicine at Leyden, and was succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frid. Bern. Albinius. He was twice rector of the university, and as often he refused that high honour when it was voluntarily offered him. At length, worn out by long service and intense study, he died on the 9th of September 1770, in the 74th year of his age.\n\nALBION, the ancient name of Britain.\n\nNew Albion, a name given by Sir Francis Drake to California, on the north-west coast of America, which he discovered and took possession of in the year 1578. Captain Cook visited this coast in 1778, and landed in a place situated in N. Lat. 44° 33'. E. Long. 235° 20'. In the year 1792, it was again visited by Captain Vancouver, who was employed in surveying the western coast of North America. The extent of New Albion, according to the latter circumnavigator, is between the 30th and 40th degrees of N. Latitude.\n\nALBIRO, in Astronomy, a star of the third or fourth magnitude, in the constellation Cygnus.\n\nALBIS, in Ancient Geography, now the Elbe, which divided ancient Germany in the middle, and was the boundary of this country, so far as it was known to the Romans: all beyond they owned to be uncertain, no Roman except Drusus and Tiberius having penetrated so far as the Elbe. In the year of the building of the city 744, or about five years before Christ, Domitius Ahenobarbus, crossing the river with a few, merited the ornaments of a triumph; so glorious was it reckoned at Rome to have attempted the passage. In the following age, however, the river that before occupied the middle of ancient Germany, became its boundary to the north, from the irruptions of the Sarmatian, who possessed themselves of the Transalpine Germany. The Elbe rises in the borders of Cilicia out of the Rifenberg, runs through Bohemia, Misnia, Upper Saxony, Anhalt, Magdeburg, Brandenburg, Danneberg, Lauenburg, Holstein, and after being twinned by many other rivers, and passing by Hamburg and Glückstadt, to both which places the river is navigable by large vessels, falls into the German or North sea.\n\nALBISOLA, a small town belonging to the republic of Genoa. Here is a porcelain manufacture, and several country-houses of the Genoese nobility. It was bombarded in 1745 by the English. E. Long. 8° 20'. N. Lat. 44° 15'.\n\nALBOGALERUS, in Roman Antiquity, a white cap worn by the Flamen Dialis, on the top of which was an ornament of olive branches.\n\nALBORAK, amongst the Mahometan Writers, the beast on which Mahomet rode in his journeys to heaven. The Arab commentators give many fables concerning this extraordinary mode of conveyance. It is represented as of an intermediate shape and size between an ass and a mule. A place, it seems, was secured for it in paradise at the intercession of Mahomet; which, however, was in some measure extorted from the prophet, by Alborak's refusing to let him mount when the angel Gabriel was come to conduct him to heaven.\n\nALBORO, in Zoology, a name by which the erythrinus, a small red fish caught in the Mediterranean, is commonly known in the markets of Rome and Venice.\n\nALBORG, a town of Denmark, in North Jutland, capital of the diocese of the same name, and a bishop's see. It has this name, which signifies eel-town, on account of the great number of eels taken here. It is seated on a canal, 10 miles from the sea, 30 north of Viborg, and 50 north of Arhus. It has an exchange for merchants, and a safe and deep harbour. They have a considerable trade in herrings and corn; and a manufacture of guns, pistols, saddles, and gloves. E. Long. 29° 16'. N. Lat. 56° 35'.\n\nALBRICIUS, born at London, was a great philosopher, a learned and able physician, and well versed in all the branches of polite literature. He lived in the 11th century, and wrote several works in Latin; particularly, 1. Of the Origin of the Gods. 2. The Virtues of the Ancients. 3. The Nature of Poison, &c.\n\nALBUCA, Bastard Star-of-Bethlehem. See Botany Index.\n\nALBUGINEA TUNICA, in Anatomy, the third or innermost coat or covering of the testes; it is likewise the name given to one of the coats of the eye.\n\nALBUGINEUS, in Anatomy, a term sometimes applied to the aqueous humour of the eye.\n\nALBUGO, or LEUCOMA, in Medicine, a distemper occasioned by a white opaque spot growing on the cornea of the eye, and obstructing vision. See Medicine Index.\n\nALBUM, in Antiquity, a kind of white table, or register, wherein the names of certain magistrates, public transactions, &c. were entered. Of these there were various sorts; as the album decurionum, album senatorum, album judicum, album praetoris, &c.\n\nAlbum Decurionum, was the register wherein the names of the decuriones were entered. This is otherwise called matriculatio decurionum.\n\nAlbum Senatorum, the list of senators names, which was first introduced by Augustus, and renewed yearly.\n\nAlbum Judicum, that wherein the names of the persons of those decuriae who judged at certain times were entered.\n\nAlbum Praetoris, that wherein the formulae of all actions, and the names of such judges as the praetor had chosen to decide causes, were written.\n\nThe high priest entered the chief transactions of each year into an album, or table, which was hung up in his house for the public use.\n\nAlbum is also used, in later times, to denote a kind of table, or pocket-book, wherein the men of letters with whom a person has conversed, inscribed their names with some sentence or motto.\n\nAlbum Graecum, the white dung of dogs, formerly prescribed for inflammations of the throat, &c. but now disused, and chiefly employed by leather-dressers to soften leather after the application of lime.\n\nALBUMAZAR, a learned Arabian astronomer in the tenth century, who wrote a treatise Of the Revolution of the Years.\n\nALBUMEN, a substance found both in animal and vegetable\nvegetable matters, and in great abundance in the white of eggs. See Chemistry Index.\n\nALBUQUERQUE, a town of Spain, in the province of Estremadura, is seated on an eminence, nine miles from the frontiers of Portugal. It is commanded by an almost impregnable fortress, built on a high mountain, and serving to defend the town. It carries on a great trade in wool and woollen manufactures. It was taken by the allies of Charles king of Spain in 1705. W. Long. 7°. N. Lat. 38°. 52'.\n\nALBURN, the English name of a compound colour, being a mixture of white and red, or reddish brown. Skinner derives the word, in this sense, from the Latin albus, and the Italian burno, from bruno, \"brown.\"\n\nALBURNUM, the soft white substance which in trees is found between the liber or inner bark and the wood, and in progress of time acquiring solidity, becomes itself the wood. From its colour and comparative softness, it has been styled by some writers the fat of trees, adeps arborum.\n\nThe albumen is found in large quantities in trees that are vigorous; though in such as languish, or are sickly, there is a great number of buds. In an oak six inches in diameter, this substance is nearly equal in bulk to the wood. In a trunk of one foot diameter, it is as one to three and a half; of two and a half feet diameter, as one to four and a half, &c., but these proportions vary according to the health and constitution of the trees.—The albumen is frequently gnawed in pieces by insects, which lodge in the substance, and are nourished from it.\n\nALBURNUS, in Zoology, a species of the cyprinus of Linnaeus. See Cyprinus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nALCA, or Auk. See Ornithology Index.\n\nALCEUS, a famous ancient lyric poet, born at Mitylene, in the island of Lesbos. Horace seems to think him the inventor of this kind of poetry:\n\nNow the Roman muse inspire,\nAnd warm the song with Grecian fire. Francis.\n\nHe flourished in the 44th Olympiad, at the same time with Sappho, who was likewise of Mitylene. Alceus was a great enemy to tyrants, but not a very brave soldier. He was present at an engagement, wherein the Athenians gained a victory over the Lebians; and here, as he himself is said to have confessed in one of his pieces, he threw down his arms, and saved himself by flight. Horace, who, of all the Latin poets, most resembled Alceus, has made the like confession:\n\nWith thee I saw Philippi's plain,\nIts fatal rout, a fearful scene!\nAnd dropp'd, alas! th' inglorious shield,\nWhere valour's self was forc'd to yield;\nWhere foil'd in dust the vanquish'd lay,\nAnd breath'd th' indignant soul away. Francis.\n\nThe poetical abilities of Alceus are indisputable; and, though his writings were chiefly in the lyric strain, yet his muse was capable of treating the sublimest subjects with a suitable dignity. Hence Horace says,\n\nAlceus strikes the golden strings,\nAnd seas, and war, and exile, sings.\nThus while they strike the various lyre,\nThe ghosts the sacred sounds admire;\n\nBut when Alceus lifts the strain\nTo deeds of war and tyrants slain,\nIn thicker crowds the shadowy throng\nDrink deeper down the martial song. Francis.\n\nAlceus, an Athenian tragic poet, and, as some think, the first composer of tragedies. He renounced his native country Mitylene, and passed for an Athenian. He left 16 pieces, one of which was Paphia, that which he produced when he disputed with Aristophanes, in the 9th year of the 97th Olympiad.\n\nThere is another Alceus mentioned in Plutarch, perhaps the same whom Porphyrius mentions as a composer of satirical lambics and epigrams, and who wrote a poem concerning the plagiarist of Euphorus the historian. He lived in the 14th Olympiad.\n\nWe are told likewise of one Alceus, a Messenian, who lived in the reign of Vespasian and Titus. We know not which of these it was who suffered for his lewdness a very singular kind of death, which gave occasion to the following epitaph:\n\nΑλκευς ταφος γυνης, &c.\n\nThis is Alceus's tomb; who died by a radish,\nThe daughter of the earth, and punisher of adulterers.\nThis punishment inflicted on adulterers, was thrusting one of the largest radishes up the anus of the adulterer: or, for want of radishes, they made use of a fish with a very large head, which Juvenal alludes to:\n\nQuodam macbos et mugillis intrat. Sat. x.\nThe mullet enters some behind.\n\nHence we may understand the menace of Catullus,\n\nAh! tum te miserum, malique fati,\nQuem attrahit pedibus, patente porta,\nPercurrent raphanique, mugilisque. Epig. xv.\nAh! wretched thou, and born to luckless fate,\nWho art discover'd by the unholy gate!\nIf once, alas! the jealous husband come,\nThe radish or the sea-fish thy doom.\n\nALCAICS, in Ancient Poetry, a denomination given to several kinds of verse, from Alceus, their inventor. The first kind consists of five feet, viz. a spondee, or iambic; an iambic; a long syllable; a dactyl; another dactyl: such is the following verse of Horace:\n\nOmnes | vol|dem cogni|nur, | omnium\nVerfa|tur urba |[arius] | ocyus |\nSors exi|tura.\n\nThe second kind consists of two dactyls and two trochees: as,\n\nExili|um impos|tura | cymbe.\n\nBesides these two, which are called dactylic Alcaics, there is another styled simply Alcic; consisting of an epitrite; a choriambus; another choriambus; and a bacchius: the following is of this species,\n\nCur timet flavum Tiberim tangere, cur olivum?\n\nAlcaic Ode, a kind of manly ode composed of several strophes, each consisting of four verses; the two first of which are always Alcaics of the first kind; the third verse is a diameter hypercataleptic, or consisting of four feet and a long syllable; and the fourth verse is an Alcaic of the second kind. The following strophe is\nALCAID, ALCAIDE, or ALCALDE, in the polity of the Moors, Spaniards, and Portuguese, a magistrate, or officer of justice, answering nearly to the French provost and the British justice of peace.—The alcáid among the Moors is vested with supreme jurisdiction, both in civil and criminal cases.\n\nALCALA de Guadeira, a small town of Spain, in Andalusia, upon the river Guadeira. Here are abundance of springs, from whence they convey water to Seville by an aqueduct. W. Long. 6° 16'. N. Lat. 37° 15'.\n\nALCALA de Henares, a beautiful and large city of Spain, in New Castile, seated upon the river Henares, which washes its walls. It is built in a very agreeable plain, and is of an oval figure. The streets are handsome and pretty straight; one of them is very long, running from one end of the city to the other. The houses are well built; and there are several squares, the largest of which is an ornament to the city; it is surrounded on all sides with piazzas, where tradesmen have their shops, to expose several sorts of commodities to sale, of which there is as great plenty and variety as in most towns of Spain. The university was founded by Cardinal Ximenes, archbishop of Toledo, about the beginning of the 16th century. The land about Alcala is watered by the Henares, well cultivated, and very fruitful, while that at a distance is dry and sterile: it yields grain in plenty, very good mule-cattle, wine, and melons of a delicious kind. Without the walls is a spring, the water of which is so pure and so well tasted, that it is inclosed and shut up for the king of Spain's own use, from whence it is carried to Madrid.—This city is 10 miles south-west of Guadalajara, and 13 miles east of Madrid. W. Long. 4° 20'. N. Lat. 40° 30'.\n\nALCALA-Real, a small city of Spain, in Andalusia, with a fine abbey. It is built on the top of a high mountain, in a mountainous country; and the road to it is inconvenient, rough, and unequal; but to make amends for this, here are several kinds of exquisite fruit and wine. W. Long. 4° 15'. N. Lat. 37° 18'.\n\nALCALY, or ALCALI, or ALKALI. See Chemistry Index.\n\nALCANIS, a town of Arragon in Spain, seated on the river Guadaloupe, 12 miles from Caffe. It was formerly the capital of the kingdom of the Moors; but being taken from them, it was made a commandery of the order of Calatrava. Here is a very remarkable fountain, which throws up water through 42 pipes. It is surrounded with gardens and fruit trees, and defended by a good fortress. W. Long. 0° 5'. N. Lat. 41° 0'.\n\nALCANNIA, or ALCANNA, in Commerce, a powder prepared from the leaves of the Egyptian privet, in which the people of Cairo drive a considerable trade. It is much used by the Turkish women to give a golden colour to their nails and hair. In dyeing, it gives a yellow colour when steeped with common water, and a red one when infused in vinegar. There is also an oil extracted from the berries of alcanna, which is sometimes used in medicine.\n\nALCANTARA, a small, but very strong city of Extremadura, in Spain. It gives name to one of the three orders of knighthood. It is seated on the banks of the Tajo, or Tagus, 21 miles from Cordova, in a very fruitful soil, and is celebrated for its bridge over that river. This was built in the time of the emperor Trajan, as appears by an inscription over one of the arches, by the people of Lusitania, who were obliged to supply the expense. It is raised 200 feet above the level of the water; and though it consists but of six arches, is 670 feet in length, and 23 in breadth. At the entrance of the bridge, there is a small antique chapel hewn in a rock by the ancient Pagans, who dedicated it to Trajan, as the Christians did to St Julian. This city was built by the Moors, on account of the convenience of this bridge; which is at a place where the Tajo is very deep, running between two high steep rocks: for this reason they called it Al-Cantara, which in their language, signifies the Bridge. It was taken from them in 1214, and given to the knights of Calatrava, who afterwards assumed the name of Alcantara. It was taken by the earl of Galway, in April, 1706, and retaken by the French in November following. It is 45 miles from Madrid, and 125 from Seville. W. Long. 7° 12'. N. Lat. 39° 30'.\n\nKnights of Alcantara, a military order of Spain, which took its name from the above-mentioned city. They make a very considerable figure in the history of the expeditions against the Moors. The knights of Alcantara make the same vows as those of Calatrava, and are only distinguished from them by this, that the cross fleur de lys, which they bear over a large white cloak, is of a green colour. They possess 37 commanderies. By the terms of the surrender of Alcantara to this order, it was stipulated, that there should be a confraternity between the two orders, with the same practices and observances in both; and that the order of Alcantara should be subject to be visited by the grand-master of Calatrava. But the former soon released themselves from this engagement, on pretence that their grand-master had not been called to the election of that of Calatrava, as had been likewise stipulated in the articles. After the expulsion of the Moors, and the taking of Granada, the sovereignty of the order of Alcantara and that of Calatrava was settled in the crown of Castile by Ferdinand and Isabella.—In 1548, the knights of Alcantara sued for leave to marry, which was granted them.\n\nALCAREZ, a small city of La Mancha, in Spain defended by a pretty strong castle, and remarkable for an ancient aqueduct. It stands near the river Guardamena, and the soil about it is very fruitful. They have a breed of little running horses, which are very fleet and strong. It is 25 miles north of the confines of Andalusia, 108 south of Cuenca, and 138 south by east of Madrid. W. Long. 1° 50'. N. Lat. 38° 28'.\n\nALCASSAR do-Sal, a town of Portugal, in Estremadura, which has a castle said to be impregnable. It is indeed very strong, both by art and nature, being built on the top of a rock which is exceedingly steep on all sides. Here is a salt-work which produces very white salt, from whence the town takes its name.\nfields produce large quantities of a sort of ruffies, of which they make mats, which are transported out of the kingdom. W. Long. 9. 10. N. Lat. 38. 18.\n\n**Alcassar**, a city of Barbary, situated about two leagues from Larache, in Alga, a province of the kingdom of Fez. It was of great note, and the seat of the governor of this part of the kingdom. It was built by Jacob Almanzor, king of Fez, about the year 1180, and designed for a magazine and place of rendezvous for the great preparations he was making to enter Granada in Spain, and to make good the footing Joseph Almanzor had got some time before. It is said his father first invaded Spain with 300,000 men, most of whom he was obliged to bring back to Africa to quell a rebellion that had broken out in Morocco. This done, he returned to Spain again with an army, as is said, of 200,000 horse and 300,000 foot. The city is now fallen greatly to decay, so that of fifteen mosques there are only two that they make use of. The reason, probably, is the bad situation of the town; for it stands so low, that it is excessively hot in summer, and almost overflowed with water in the winter. They affirm to be owing to a curse of one of their saints. Here are a great number of flocks, who live very familiarly with the people, walking about the town, possessing the tops of the houses and mosques without molestation; for they esteem them sacred birds, and account it sinful to disturb them. At present, the batham of Tetuan appoints a governor to this town, which is the last of his dominions towards Mequinez. Near this city there is a high ridge of mountains, running towards Tetuan, whose inhabitants were never brought entirely under subjection; and whenever it was attempted, they revenged themselves by infesting the roads, and robbing and destroying the travellers. When they were pursued, they retired into their woody mountains, where none could safely follow them. Not far from hence is the river Elmahassen, famous for the battle fought between Don Sebastian king of Portugal and the Moors; in which the Portuguese were defeated and their king slain. W. Long. 12. 35. N. Lat. 35. 15.\n\n**Alcavala**, in the Spanish Finances, was at first a tax of 10 per cent. afterwards of 14 per cent. and is at present of only 6 per cent. upon the sale of every sort of property, whether moveable or immoveable; and it is repeated every time the property is sold. The levying of this tax requires a multitude of revenue-officers sufficient to guard the transportation of goods, not only from one province to another, but from one shop to another. It subjects not only the dealers in some sorts of goods, but those in all sorts, every farmer, every manufacturer, every merchant and shopkeeper, to the continual visits and examination of the tax-gatherers. Through the greater part of a country in which a tax of this kind is established, nothing can be produced for distant sale. The produce of every part of the country must be proportioned to the consumption of the neighbourhood. It is to the Alcavala, accordingly, that Ufartiz attributes the ruin of the manufactures of Spain. He might have imputed it to likewise the declension of agriculture, it being imposed not only upon manufactures, but upon the rude produce of the land.\n\n**Alcazar Leguer**, a town of Africa, in the kingdom of Fez, and in the province of Ifrout. It was taken by Alphonso, king of Portugal, in 1468; but soon after that, it was abandoned to the Moors. It is seated on the coast of the straits of Gibraltar. W. Long. 3. 50. N. Lat. 38. 0.\n\n**Alcazer**, a town of Spain, in New Castle, seated on the river Guardamena, which has a fortress on a high hill for its defence, and lies in a very fruitful country. It is 100 miles north-west of Carthagena. W. Long. 2. 10. N. Lat. 38. 15.\n\n**Alce**, **Alces**, or **Elk**, in Zoology, the trivial name of a species of the cervus, belonging to the order of mammalia pecora. See Cervus.\n\n**Alcea**, the Holly-Hock. See Botany Index.\n\n**Alcedo**, or Kingfisher. See Ornithology Index.\n\n**Alchemilla**, or Ladies-mantle. See Botany Index.\n\n**Alchemist**, a practitioner in alchemy.\n\n**Alchemy**, that branch of chemistry which had for its principal objects the transmutation of metals into gold; the panacea, or universal remedy; an alkali, or universal menstruum; an universal ferment; and many other things equally ridiculous.\n\nKircher, instructed in all the secrets of chemistry, has fully exposed the artifices and impostures of alchemists. An alchemist puts into a crucible the matter which is to be converted into gold: this he sets on the fire, blows it, stirs it with rods; and, after divers operations, gold is found at the bottom of the crucible, instead of the matter first put in. This there are a thousand ways of effecting, without any transmutation. Sometimes it is done by dextrously dropping in a piece of gold concealed between the fingers, sometimes by casting in a little of the dust of gold or silver disguised under the appearance of some elixir, or other indifferent matter; sometimes a crucible is used which has a double bottom, and gold put between the two; sometimes the rod used to stir the matter is hollow, and filled with the dust of the metal desired; at other times there is metal mixed with the charcoal, the ashes of the furnace, or the like. Mr Harris very properly distinguishes alchemy from chemistry; and defines the former to be *ars sine arte*, cujus principium est mentiri, medium laborare, et finis mendicare; and the Italians have a proverb, *non ti fidare al alchemista povero o medico amato*. The ruin which has attended this delusion has occasioned several states to make severe laws against pretences to alchemy. The Romans formerly banished all such as professed it; and the sacred canons likewise directed the thunder of their censure against them. Diocletian and Caesar directed all books which treated of this subject to be burnt. Rymer furnishes us with a license for practising alchemy, with all kinds of metals and minerals, granted to one Richard Carter in 1476; Rymer, tom. xii. Nevertheless, we have had severe laws against alchemy, and multiplying of metals, as much so as against coinage itself.\n\n**Alchornea**. See Botany Index.\n\n**Alciat** or **Alciate**, Andrew, a great lawyer, who flourished in the 16th century, was born at Milan. He mixed much of polite learning in the explication of the laws, and happily drove out the barbarity of language which till then had reigned in the lectures and writings of lawyers; for which Thuanus highly praises.\nAlcibiades praises him. He published a great many law-books, and some notes upon Tacitus. His Emblems have been much admired, and translated into French, Italian, and Spanish; and several learned men have written commentaries on them.\n\nALCIBIADES, an Athenian general. It was the fate of this great man to live at a time when his country was a scene of confusion. The Greeks, grown insolent from their conquests in Persia, turned their armies against each other, and banded together under the conduct of the two most opulent states, Athens and Macedon. Alcibiades, in the midst of an expedition he had planned against the enemies of his country, was recalled home to answer some charge of a private nature; but fearing the violence of his enemy, instead of going to Athens, he offered his services at Sparta, where they were readily accepted. By his advice the Macedonians made a league with Persia, which gave a very favourable turn to their affairs. But his credit in the republic raising jealousies against him, he privately reconciled himself to his country, and took again the command of an Athenian army. Here victory, waiting as it were at his command, attended all his motions. The loss of seven battles obliged the Spartans to sue for peace. He enjoyed his triumphs, however, only a short time at Athens. One unsuccessful event made him again obnoxious to the malice of his citizens; and he found it expedient to retire from Athens. In his absence the Spartans again took the lead, and at the fatal battle of Eges entirely subdued the Athenian power. Alcibiades, though an exile, endeavoured to restore the power of his country; of which the Spartans having intelligence, procured him to be assassinated. He was a man of admirable accomplishments, but indifferently principled; of great parts; and of an amazing versatility of genius.\n\nALCINOUS, king of the Phaeacians, in the island now called Corfu, was son of Nautilus, and grandson of Neptune and Peribea. It is by his gardens this king has chiefly immortalized his memory. He received Ulysses with much civility, when a storm had cast him on his coast. The people here loved pleasure and good cheer, yet were skilful seamen; and Alcinous was a good prince.\n\nALCMAN, a lyric poet, who flourished in the 27th Olympiad, about 670 years before Christ. He was born at Sparta; and composed several poems, of which only some fragments are remaining, quoted by Athenaeus and some other ancient writers. He was very amorous; accounted the father of gallant poetry; and is said to have been the first that introduced the custom of singing love songs in company. He is reported to have been one of the greatest eaters of his age; upon which Mr Bayle remarks, that such a quality would have been extremely inconvenient, if poetry had been at that time upon such a footing, as it has been often since, not able to procure the poet bread. He died of a strange disease; for he was eaten up with lice.\n\nALCMANIAN, in Ancient Lyric Poetry, a kind of verse consisting of two dactyls and two trochees; as,\n\nVirginius puerique cantos.\n\nThe word is formed from Alcman, the name of an ancient Greek poet, in great esteem for his erotics or amorous compositions.\n\nALCMENA, the daughter of Eleotheo king of Mycenae, and wife of Amphitryon. Jupiter putting on the shape of her husband while he was abroad in the wars, begot Hercules upon her: he made that night as long as three ordinary ones.\n\nALCOCK, JOHN, doctor of laws, and bishop of Ely in the reign of King Henry VII. Was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, and educated at Cambridge. He was first made dean of Wellsminster, and afterwards appointed master of the rolls. In 1471, he was consecrated bishop of Rochester; in 1476, he was translated to the see of Worcester; and in 1486, to that of Ely, in the room of Dr John Morton, preferred to the see of Canterbury. He was a prelate of great learning and piety; and so highly esteemed by King Henry, that he appointed him lord president of Wales, and afterwards lord chancellor of England. Alcock founded a school at Kingston upon Hull, and built the spacious hall belonging to the episcopal palace at Ely. He was also the founder of Jesus college in Cambridge, for a master, six fellows, and as many scholars. This house was formerly a nunnery, dedicated to St Radegund; and, as Godwin tells us, the building being greatly decayed, and the revenues reduced almost to nothing, the nuns had all forsaken it, except two; whereupon Bishop Alcock procured a grant from the crown, and converted it into a college. But Camden and others tell us, that the nuns of that house were notorious for their incontinence, that King Henry VII. and Pope Julius II. consented to its dissolution: Bale accordingly calls this nunnery \"spiritualium meretricum cenobium,\" \"a community of spiritual harlots.\" Bishop Alcock wrote several pieces; among which are the following: 1. Mons Perfectionis. 2. In Psalmorum Petentiales. 3. Homiliae Vulgares. 4. Meditationes Pia. He died October 1, 1500; and was buried in the chapel he had built at Kingston upon Hull.\n\nALCOHOL, or ALKOHOL, in Chemistry, spirit of wine highly rectified. It is also used for any highly\nAlcohol rectified spirit.—Alcohol is extremely light and inflammable: It is a strong antiseptic, and therefore employed to preserve animal substances. See Chemistry Index.\n\nAlcohol is also used for any fine impalpable powder.\n\nALCOHOLIZATION, the process of rectifying any spirit. It is also used for pulverization.\n\nALCOR, in Astronomy, a small star adjoining to the large bright one in the middle of the tail of ura major.—The word is Arabic. It is a proverb among the Arabs, applied to one who pretends to see small things, but overlooks much greater: Thou canst see Alcor, and yet not see the full moon.\n\nALCORAN, or Al-koran, the scripture, or bible of the Mahometans. The word is compounded of the Arabic particle al, and coran or koran, derived from the verb caraar or karaa, to read. The word therefore properly signifies, the reading; or rather, that which ought to be read. By this name the Mahometans denote not only the entire book or volume of the Koran, but also any particular chapter or section of it; just as the Jews call either the whole Scripture, or any part of it, by the name of Karab, or Mikra, words of the same origin and import.\n\nBesides this peculiar name, the Koran is also honoured with several appellations common to other books of Scripture: as, al Farqan, from the verb faraka, to divide or distinguish; not, as the Mahometan doctors say, because those books are divided into chapters or sections, or distinguish between good and evil; but in the same notion that the Jews use the word Perak, or Pirka, from the same root, to denote a section or portion of Scripture. It is also called al Mojsaf, the volume, and al Kitab, the book, by way of eminence, which answers to the Bibliia of the Greeks; and al Dhikr, the admonition, which name is also given to the Pentateuch and Gospel.\n\nThe Koran is divided into 114 larger portions of very unequal length, which we call chapters; but the Arabs jowar, in the singular jowa, a word rarely used on any other occasion, and properly signifying a row, order, or a regular series; as a course of bricks in building, or a rank of soldiers in an army; and is the same in use and import with the Sura, or Tora, of the Jews, who also call the fifty-three sections of the Pentateuch Sedarim, a word of the same signification.\n\nThese chapters are not, in the manuscript copies, distinguished by their numerical order, but by particular titles, which are taken sometimes from a particular matter treated of, or person mentioned therein; but usually from the first word of note, exactly in the same manner as the Jews have named their Sedarim; though the word from which some chapters are denominated be very far distant, towards the middle, or perhaps the end, of the chapter; which seems ridiculous. But the occasion of this appears to have been, that the verse or passage wherein such word occurs, was, in point of time, revealed and committed to writing before the other verses of the same chapter which proceed it in order; and the title being given to the chapter before it was completed, or the passages reduced to their present order, the verse from whence such title was taken did not always happen to begin the chapter. Some chapters have two or more titles, occasioned by the difference of the copies.\n\nSome of the chapters having been revealed at Mecca, and others at Medina, the noting this difference makes a part of the title: but the reader will observe, that several of the chapters are said to have been revealed partly at Mecca and partly at Medina; and, as to others, it is yet a dispute among the commentators to which of the two places they belong.\n\nEvery chapter is subdivided into smaller portions, of very unequal length also, which we customarily call verses: but the Arabic word is ayat, the same with the Hebrew ootot, and signifies signs or wonders: such as are the secrets of God, his attributes, works, judgments, and ordinances, delivered in those verses; many of which have their particular titles also, imprinted in the same manner as those of the chapters.\n\nBesides these unequal divisions of chapter and verse, the Mahometans have also divided their Koran into sixty equal portions, which they call Absaba, in the singular Hizb, each subdivided into four equal parts; which is also an imitation of the Jews, who have an ancient division of their Mishna into sixty portions called Mafsechoth. But the Koran is more usually divided into thirty sections only, named Ajza, from the singular Joz, each of twice the length of the former, and in the like manner subdivided into four parts. These divisions are for the use of the readers of the Koran in the royal temples, or in the adjoining chapels where the emperors and great men are interred. There are thirty of these readers belonging to every chapel, and each reads his section every day; so that the whole Koran is read over once a day.\n\nNext after the title, at the head of every chapter, except only the ninth, is prefixed the following solemn form, by the Mahometans called the Bismillah, In the name of the most Merciful God; which form they constantly place at the beginning of all their books and writings in general, as a peculiar mark or distinguishing characteristic of their religion, it being counted a sort of impiety to omit it. The Jews, for the same purpose, make use of the form, In the name of the Lord, or, In the name of the great God; and the eastern Christians that of, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. But Mahomet probably took this form, as he did many other things, from the Persian Magi, who used to begin their books in these words, Benam Yezdan bat jbnajfigher dadar; that is, In the name of the most merciful just God.\n\nThere are twenty-nine chapters of the Koran, which have this peculiarity, that they begin with certain letters of the alphabet, some with a single one, others with more. These letters the Mahometans believe to be the peculiar marks of the Koran, and to conceal several profound mysteries; the certain understanding of which, the more intelligent confess, has not been communicated to any mortal, their prophet only excepted. Notwithstanding which, some will take the liberty of guessing at their meaning by that species of Cabala called by the Jews Notarikon, and suppose the letters to stand for as many words, expressing the names and attributes of God, his works, ordinances, and decrees; and therefore these mysterious letters, as well as the verses,\nOthers explain the intent of these letters from their nature or organ, or else from their value in numbers, according to another species of the Jewish Cabala called Gematria; the uncertainty of which conjectures sufficiently appears from their disagreement. Thus, for example, five chapters, one of which is the second, begins with these letters, A, L, M, which some imagine to stand for Allah latif mazil, \"God is gracious and to be glorified;\" or, Ana li minni, i.e., to me and from me, viz. belongs all perfection, and proceeds all good; or else for Ana Allah alam, \"I am the most wise God,\" taking the first letter to mark the beginning of the first word, the second the middle of the second word, and the third the last of the third word; or for Allah, Gabriel, Mohammed, the author, revealer, and preacher of the Koran. Others say, that as the letter A belongs to the lower part of the throat, the first of the organs of speech; L to the palate; the middle organ; and M to the lips, which are the last organ; so these letters signify that God is the beginning, middle, and end, or ought to be praised in the beginning, middle, and end, of all our words and actions: or, as the total value of those three letters, in numbers is seventy-one, they signify, that, in the space of so many years, the religion preached in the Koran should be fully established. The conjecture of a learned Christian is at least as certain as any of the former, who supposes those letters were set there by the amanuensis, for Amar li Mohammed, i.e., at the command of Mohammed, as the five letters prefixed to the nineteenth chapter seem to be there written by a Jewish scribe, for Cob yaas, i.e., Thus be commanded.\n\nThe Koran is universally allowed to be written with the utmost elegance and purity of language, in the dialect of the tribe of Koreith, the most noble and polite of all the Arabians, but with some mixture, though very rarely, of other dialects. It is confessedly the standard of the Arabic tongue, and, as the more orthodox believe, and are taught by the book itself, imitable by any human pen (though some sectaries have been of another opinion), and therefore insisted on as a permanent miracle, greater than that of raising the dead, and alone sufficient to convince the world of its divine original.\n\nAnd to this miracle did Mahomet himself chiefly appeal for the confirmation of his mission, publicly challenging the most eloquent men in Arabia, which was at that time stocked with thousands whose sole study and ambition it was to excel in elegance of style and composition, to produce even a single chapter that might be compared with it (A).\n\nTo the pomp and harmony of expression some ascribe all the force and effect of the Alcoran; which they consider as a sort of music, equally fitted with other species of that art to ravish and amaze. In this Mahomet succeeded so well, and so strangely captivated the minds of his audience, that several of his opponents thought it the effect of witchcraft and enchantment, as he himself complains.—Others have attributed the effect of the Alcoran to the frequent mention of rewards and punishments; heaven and hell occurring almost in every page. Some suppose, that the sensual pleasures of paradise, so frequently set before the imaginations of the readers of the Alcoran, were what chiefly bewitched them. Though, with regard to these, there is a great dispute whether they are to be understood literally or spiritually. Several have even allegorized the whole book.\n\nThe general design of the Koran was to unite the professors of the three different religions, then followed in the populous country of Arabia (who for the most part lived promiscuously, and wandered without guide), the far greater number being idolaters, and the rest Jews and Christians mostly of erroneous and heterodox belief), in the knowledge and worship of one God, under the sanction of certain laws, and the outward signs of ceremonies partly of ancient and partly of novel institution, enforced by the consideration of rewards and punishments both temporal and eternal; and to bring them all to the obedience of Mahomet, as the prophet and ambassador of God, who, after the repeated admonitions, promises, and threats, of former ages, was at last to establish and propagate God's religion on earth, and to be acknowledged chief pontiff in spiritual matters, as well as supreme prince in temporal.\n\nThe great doctrine then of the Koran, is the unity of God; to restore which point Mahomet pretended was the chief end of his mission; it being laid down by him as a fundamental truth, That there never was, nor ever can be, more than one true orthodox religion. For, though the particular laws or ceremonies are only temporary, and subject to alteration, according to the divine direction; yet the substance of it being eternal truth, is not liable to change, but continues immutably the same. And he taught, that, whenever this religion became neglected, or corrupted in essentials, God had the goodness to re-inform and re-admonish mankind thereof, by several prophets, of whom Moses and Jesus were the most distinguished, till the appearance of Mahomet, who is their head, and no other to be expected after him. The more effectually to engage people to hearken to him, great part of the Koran is employed in relating examples of dreadful punishments formerly inflicted by God on those who rejected and abused his messengers; several of which stories, or some circumstances of them, are taken from the Old and New Testaments, but many more from the apocryphal books and traditions of the Jews and Christians of those ages, set up in the Koran as truths in opposition to the Scriptures, which the Jews and Christians are charged with having altered: and indeed, few or none of the relations or circumstances in the Koran were invented by Mahomet, as is generally supposed, it being easy to trace the greatest part of them.\n\n(A) As the composition and arrangement of words, however, admit of infinite varieties, it can never be absolutely said that any one is the best possible. In fact, Hamzah Benhmed wrote a book against the Alcoran, with at least equal elegance; and Mofeema another, which even surpassed it, and occasioned a defection of a great part of the Mussulmans. Journ. de Sçav. tom. xiii. p. 280. Oeuvr. de Sçav. Nov. 1708, p. 494.\nthem much higher, as the rest might be, were more of those books extant, and was it worth while to make the inquiry.\n\nThe rest of the Alcoran is taken up in prescribing necessary laws and directions, frequent admonitions to moral and divine virtues, the worship and reverence of the Supreme Being, and resignation to his will. One of their most learned commentators distinguishes the contents of the Alcoran into allegorical and literal; under the former are comprehended all the obscure, parabolical, and enigmatical passages, with such as are repealed, or abrogated; the latter, such as are clear, and in full force.\n\nThe most excellent moral in the whole Alcoran, interpreters say, is that in the chapter Al Arafah, viz. \"Shew mercy, do good to all, and dispute not with the ignorant;\" or, as Mr Sale renders it, \"Use indulgence, command that which is just, and withdraw far from the ignorant.\" Mahomet, according to the authors of the Keshaf, having begged of the angel Gabriel a more ample explication of this passage, received it in the following terms: \"Seek him who turns thee out, give to him who takes from thee, pardon him who injures thee; for God will have you plant in your souls the roots of his chief perfections.\" It is easy to see that this commentary is copied from the gospel. In reality, the necessity of forgiving enemies, though frequently inculcated in the Alcoran, is of a later date, among the Mahometans than among the Christians; among those latter, than among the heathens; and to be traced originally among the Jews. (See Exodus xxxiii. 4-5.) But it matters not so much who had it first, as who observes it best. The caliph Haffan, son of Halli, being at table, a slave unfortunately let fall a dish of meat reeking hot, which scalded him severely. The slave fell on his knees, rehearsing the words of the Alcoran, \"Paradise is for those who restrain their anger.\" I am not angry with thee, answered the caliph.—\"And for those who forgive offences against them,\" continues the slave. I forgive thee thine, replies the caliph.—\"But above all, for those who return good for evil,\" adds the slave. I set thee at liberty, rejoined the caliph; and I give thee ten dinars.\n\nThere are also a great number of occasional passages in the Alcoran, relating only to particular emergencies. For this advantage Mahomet had in the piecemeal method of receiving his revelation, that whenever he happened to be perplexed and gravelled with any thing, he had a certain resource in some new morsel of revelation. It was an admirable contrivance of his, to bring down the whole Alcoran at once, only to the lowest heaven, not to earth; since, had the whole been published at once, innumerable objections would have been made, which it would have been impossible for him to solve; but as he received it by parcels, as God saw fit they should be published for the conversion and instruction of the people, he had a sure way to answer all emergencies, and to extricate himself with honour from any difficulty which might occur.\n\nIt is the general and orthodox belief among the Mahometans, that the Koran is of divine original; nay, that it is eternal and uncreated, remaining, as some express it, in the very essence of God: that the first transcript has been from everlasting by God's throne, written on a table of vast bignets, called the preserved table, in which are also recorded the divine decrees past and future: that a copy from this table, in one volume on paper, was by the ministry of the angel Gabriel sent down to the lowest heaven, in the month of Ramadan, on the night of power: from whence Gabriel revealed it to Mahomet by parcels, some at Mecca, and some at Medina, at different times, during the space of 23 years, as the exigencies of affairs required; giving him, however, the consolation to show him the whole (which they tell us was bound in silk, and adorned with gold and precious stones of paradise) once a-year; but in the last year of his life he had the favour to see it twice. They say, that few chapters were delivered entire, the most part being revealed piecemeal, and written down from time to time by the prophet's amanuensis in such a part of such and such a chapter, till they were completed, according to the directions of the angel. The first parcel that was revealed is generally agreed to have been the first five verses of the 96th chapter.\n\nAfter the new-revealed passages had been from the prophet's mouth taken down in writing by his scribe, they were published to his followers; several of whom took copies for their private use, but the far greater number got them by heart. The originals, when returned, were put promiscuously into a chest, observing no order of time; for which reason it is uncertain when many passages were revealed.\n\nWhen Mahomet died, he left his revelations in the same disorder, and not digested into the method, such as it is, in which we now find them. This was the work of his successor Abu Beer; who, considering that a great number of passages were committed to the memory of Mahomet's followers, many of whom were slain in their wars, ordered the whole to be collected, not only from the palm-leaves and skins on which they had been written, and which were kept between two boards or covers, but also from the mouths of such as had gotten them by heart. And this transcript, when completed, he committed to the custody of Hassa the daughter of Omar, one of the prophet's widows.\n\nFrom this relation it is generally imagined that Abu Beer was really the compiler of the Koran; though, for ought appears to the contrary, Mahomet left the chapters complete as we now have them, excepting such passages as his successor might add or correct from those who had gotten them by heart; what Abu Beer did else, being perhaps no more than to range the chapters in their present order, which he seems to have done without any regard to time, having generally placed the longest first.\n\nHowever, in the 30th year of the Hegira, Othman being then caliph, and observing the great disagreement in the copies of the Koran in the several provinces of the empire: those of Irak, for example, following the reading of Abu Musa al Ashari, and the Syrians that of Maccad Ebn Aswad; he, by the advice of the companions, ordered a great number of copies to be transcribed from that of Abu Beer, in Hassa's care, under the inspection of Zeid Ebn Thabet, Abd'allah Ebn Zobair, Said Ebn al As, and Abd'al-rahman Ebn al Harith the Makhzumite; whom he directed, that, wherever they disagreed about any word, they should write it in the dialect of the Ko-\nreith, in which it was at first delivered. These copies, when made, were dispersed in the several provinces of the empire, and the old ones burnt and superseded. Though many things in Hafiz's copy were corrected by the above-mentioned revilers, yet some few various readings still occur.\n\nIn fine, the book of the Alcoran is held in the highest esteem and reverence among the Musselmans. They dare not so much as touch the Alcoran without being first washed, or legally purified; to prevent which, an inscription is put on the cover or label, *Let none touch but they who are clean.* It is read with great care and respect; being never held below the girdle. They swear by it; take omens from it on all weighty occasions; carry it with them to war; write sentences of it in their banners; adorn it with gold and precious stones; and knowingly suffer it not to be in the possession of any of a different religion. Some say that it is punishable even with death, in a Christian, to touch it; others, that the veneration of the Musselmans leads them to condemn the translating it into any other language as a profanation: but these seem to be aggravations. The Mahometans have taken care to have their Scripture translated into the Persian, the Javanese, the Malayan, and other languages; though, out of respect to the original, these versions are generally, if not always, interlinedated.\n\nBy the advocates of Mahometanism, the Koran, as already observed, has always been held forth as the greatest of miracles, and equally stupendous with the act of raising the dead. The miracles of Moses and Jesus, they say, were transient and temporary; but that of the Koran is permanent and perpetual; and therefore far surpasses all the miraculous events of preceding ages. We will not detract from the real merit of the Koran: we allow it to be generally elegant, and often sublime; but at the same time we reject with disdain its arrogant pretence to anything supernatural; all the real excellence of the work being easily referable to natural and visible causes.\n\n\"In the language of Arabia, a language extremely loved and diligently cultivated by the people to whom it was vernacular, Mahomet found advantages which were never enjoyed by any former succeeding impostor. It requires not the eye of a philosopher to discover in every soil and country a principle of national pride: and if we look back for many ages on the history of the Arabians, we shall easily perceive that pride among them invariably to have consisted in the knowledge and improvement of their native language. The Arabic, which has been justly esteemed the most copious of the Eastern tongues; which had existed from the remotest antiquity; which had been embellished by numberless poets, and refined by the constant exercise of the natives; was the most successful instrument which Mahomet employed in planting his new religion among them. Admirably adapted by its unrivalled harmony, and by its endless variety to add painting to expression, and to pursue the imagination in its unbounded flight; it became in the hands of Mahomet an irresistible charm to blind the judgment, and to captivate the fancy of his followers.\n\n\"Of that description of men, who first composed the adherents of Mahomet, and to whom the Koran was addressed, few, probably, were able to pass a very accurate judgment on the propriety of the sentiments, or on the beauties of the diction: but all could judge of the military abilities of their leader; and in the midst of their admiration it is not difficult to conceive, that they would ascribe to his compositions every imaginary beauty of inspired language.\n\n\"The shepherd and the soldier, though awake to the charms of those wild but beautiful compositions, in which were celebrated their favourite occupations of love or war, were yet little able to criticise any other works than those which were addressed to the imagination or the heart. To abstract reasonings on the attributes and the dispensations of the Deity, to the comparative excellencies of rival religions, to the consistency of any one religious system in all its parts, and to the force of its various proofs, they were quite insentient. In such a situation, the appearance of a work which possessed something like wisdom and confidence; which prescribed the rules, and illustrated the duties of life; and which contained the principles of a new and comparatively sublime theology, independently of its real and permanent merit, was likely to excite their astonishment, and to become the standard of future composition.\n\n\"In the first periods of the literature of every country, something of this kind has happened. The father of Grecian poetry very obviously influenced the taste and imitation of his countrymen. The modern nations of Europe all possess some original author, who, rising from the darkness of former ages, has begun the career of composition, and tinctured with the character of his own imagination the stream which has flowed through his posterity.\n\n\"But the prophet of Arabia had in this respect advantages peculiar to himself. His compositions were not to his followers the works of man, but the genuine language of Heaven, which had sent him. They were not confined therefore to that admiration which is so liberally bestowed on the earliest productions of genius, or to that fond attachment with which men everywhere regard the original compositions of their country: but with their admiration they blended their piety. To know and to feel the beauties of the Koran, was in some respect to share in the temper of heaven; and he who was most affected with admiration in the perusal of its beauties, seemed most fitly the object of that mercy which had given it to ignorant man. The Koran, therefore, became naturally and necessarily the standard of taste. With a language thus hallowed in their imaginations, they were too well satisfied, either to dispute its elegance or improve its structure. In succeeding ages, the additional sanction of antiquity, or prescription, was given to these compositions which their fathers had admired: and while the belief of its divine original continues, that admiration, which has thus become the test and the duty of the faithful, can neither be altered nor diminished.\n\n\"When therefore we consider these peculiar advantages of the Koran, we have no reason to be surprized at the admiration in which it is held. But if, descending to a more minute investigation of it, we consider its perpetual inconsistence and absurdity, we shall indeed have cause for astonishment at that weakness of humanity which could ever have received such compositions as the work of the Deity.\"\nThe first praise of all the productions of genius, is invention; that quality of the mind, which, by the extent and quickness of its views, is capable of the largest conceptions, and of forming new combinations of objects the most distant and unusual. But the Koran bears little impression of this transcendent character. Its materials are wholly borrowed from the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, from the Talmudical legends and apocryphal gospels then current in the East, and from the traditions and fables which abounded in Arabia. The materials collected from these several sources are here heaped together, with perpetual and needless repetitions, without any settled principle or visible connection.\n\nWhen a great part of the life of Mahomet had been spent in preparatory meditation on the system he was about to establish, its chapters were dealt out slowly and separately during the long period of 23 years. Yet thus defective in its structure, and not less exceptionable in its doctrines, was the work which Mahomet delivered to his followers as the oracles of God.\n\nThe most prominent feature of the Koran, that point of excellence in which the partiality of its admirers has ever delighted to view it, is the sublime notion it generally imparts of the nature and attributes of God. If its author had really derived these just conceptions from the inspiration of that Being whom they attempt to describe, they would not have been surrounded, as they now are on every side, with error and absurdity. But it might easily be proved, that whatever it justly defines of the divine attributes, was borrowed from our Holy Scripture; which even from its first promulgation, but especially from the completion of the New Testament, has extended the views and enlightened the understandings of mankind; and thus furnished them with arms, which have too often, though ineffectually, been turned against itself by its ungenerous enemies.\n\nIn this instance particularly, the copy is far below the great original, both in the propriety of its images, and the force of its descriptions. Our Holy Scriptures are the only compositions that can enable the dim light of mortality to penetrate into the invisible world, and to behold a glimpse of the Divine perfections. Accordingly, when they would represent to us the happiness of Heaven, they describe it, not by anything minute and particular, but by something general and great; something that, without descending to any determinate object, may at once by its beauty and immensity excite our wishes and elevate our affections. Though in the prophetical and evangelical writings the joys that shall attend us in a future state are often mentioned with ardent admiration, they are expressed rather by allusion than similitude, rather by indefinite and figurative terms, than by anything fixed and determinate.\n\nEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\" 1 Cor. ii. 9.\n\nWhat a reverence and astonishment does this passage excite in every hearer of taste and piety! What energy, and at the same time what simplicity, in the expression! How sublime, and at the same time how obscure, is the imagery!\n\nDifferent was the conduct of Mahomet in his descriptions of heaven and of paradise. Unassisted by the necessary influence of virtuous intentions and Divine inspiration, he was neither devious, nor indeed able, to exalt the minds of men to sublime conceptions, or to rational expectations. By attempting to explain what is inconceivable, to describe what is ineffable, and to materialize what in itself is spiritual; he absurdly and impiously aimed to sensualize the purity of the Divine essence. Thus he fabricated a system of incoherence, a religion of depravity, totally repugnant indeed to the nature of that Being, who, as he pretended, was its object; but therefore more likely to accord with the appetites and conceptions of a corrupt and sensual age.\n\nThat we may not appear to exalt our Scriptures thus far above the Koran by an unreasonable preference, we shall produce a part of the second chapter of the latter, which is deservedly admired by the Mahometans, who wear it engraved on their ornaments, and recite it in their prayers. \"God! there is no God but he; the living, the self-subsisting: neither slumber nor sleep becometh him: to him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth. Who is he that can intercede with him but through his good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and that which is to come. His throne is extended over heaven and earth, and the preservation of both is to him no burden. He is the high, the mighty.\" Sale's Kor. ii. p. 325. 4to edit.\n\nTo this description who can refuse the praise of magnificence? Part of that magnificence, however, is to be referred to that verse of the Psalms, whence it was borrowed, \"He that keepeth Israel, shall neither slumber nor sleep.\" Psa. cxxi. 4.\n\nBut if we compare it with that other passage of the same inspired Psalms, all its boasted grandeur is at once obscured, and lost in the blaze of a greater light.\n\nO my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; thy years are throughout all generations. Of old hast thou laid the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea all of them shall wax old, as doth a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.\"\n\nThe Koran, therefore, upon a retrospective view of these several circumstances, far from supporting its arrogant claim to a supernatural work, sinks below the level of many compositions confessedly of human origin; and still lower does it fall in our estimation, when compared with that pure and perfect pattern which we justly admire in the Scriptures of truth.\n\nIt is therefore abundantly apparent, that no miracle either was externally performed for the support, or is internally involved in the composition, of the Mahometan revelation.\n\nAlcoran, is also figuratively applied to certain other books full of impurities and impostures. In this sense we meet with the Alcoran of the Cordeliers, which has made a great noise; wherein St Francis is extravagantly magnified, and put on a level with Jesus Christ. The Alcoran of the Cordeliers is properly an extract of a very scarce book, entitled, The Conformity of the Life of the graphic father St Francis with the Life of Christ, published in 1510, 4to; since, at Bologna, in folio. Erasmus Albertus, being by the elector of Brandenburg appointed to visit a monastery of Franciscans,\nALCORNISTS, among Mahometans, those who adhere strictly to the letter or text of the Alcoran, from an opinion of its ultimate sufficiency and perfection. The Persians are generally Alcoranists, as admitting the Alcoran alone for their rule of faith. The Turks, Tartars, Arabs, &c., besides the Alcoran, admit a multitude of traditions. The Alcoranists, among Mahometans, amount to much the same with the Textuaries among the Jews. The Alcoranists can find nothing excellent out of the Alcoran; are enemies of philosophers, metaphysicians, and scholastic writers. With them the Alcoran is every thing.\n\nALCOVE, in Architecture, a recess, or part of a chamber separated by an entablature, or partition of columns, and other corresponding ornaments, in which is placed a bed of state, and sometimes seats to entertain company. These alcoves are frequent in Spain; and the bed is raised two or three feet, with a rail at the foot.\n\nALCUINUS, Flaccus, an ecclesiastic of the eighth century. He was born, it is supposed, in Yorkshire. He was educated, however, at York, under the direction of Archbishop Egbert, as we learn from his own letters, in which he frequently calls that great prelate his beloved master, and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful studies. As he survived Venerable Bede about 70 years, it is hardly possible that he could have received any part of his education under him, as some writers of literary history have affirmed; and it is worthy of observation, that he never calls that great man his master, though he speaks of him with the highest veneration. It is not well known to what preferments he had attained in the church before he left England, though some say he was abbot of Canterbury. The occasion of his leaving his native country, was his being sent on an embassy by Offa King of Mercia to the emperor Charlemagne; who contracted to great an esteem and friendship for him, that he earnestly solicited, and at length prevailed upon him, to settle in his court, and become his preceptor in the sciences. Alcuinus accordingly instructed that great prince in rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity; which rendered him one of his greatest favourites. \"He was treated with so much kindness and familiarity (says a contemporary writer) by the emperor, that the other courtiers called him, by way of eminence, the emperor's delight.\" Charlemagne employed his learned favourite to write several books against the heretical opinions of Felix bishop of Urgell, in Catalonia, and to defend the orthodox faith against that heresiarch, in the council of Frankfort, A.D. 804; which he performed to the entire satisfaction of the emperor and council, and even to the conviction of Felix and his followers, who abandoned their errors. The emperor consulted chiefly with Alcuinus on all things relating to religion and learning; and by his advice, did many great things for the advancement of both. An academy was established in the imperial palace, over which Alcuinus presided, and in which the princes and prime nobility were educated; and other academies were established in the chief towns of Italy and France, at his instigation, and under his inspection. \"France (says one of our best writers of literary history) is indebted to Alcuinus for all the polite learning it boasted of in that and the following ages. The universities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increase; those of whom he was not the superior and founder, being at least enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the benefits he procured for them from Charlemagne.\" After Alcuinus had spent many years in the most intimate familiarity with the greatest prince of his age, he at length, with great difficulty, obtained leave to retire from court to his abbey of St Martin's at Tours. Here he kept up a constant correspondence by letters with Charlemagne; from which it appears, that both the emperor and his learned friend were animated with the most ardent love to learning and religion, and constantly employed in contriving and executing the noblest designs for their advancement. He composed many treatises on a great variety of subjects, in a style much superior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age in which he flourished. Charlemagne often solicited him, with all the warmth of a most affectionate friend, to return to court, and favour him with his company and advice; but he still excused himself; and nothing could draw him from his retirement in his abbey of St Martin in Tours, where he died A.D. 804. His works were collected and published by Andrew du Chêne in one volume folio, Paris, 1617. They consist of, 1. Tracts upon Scripture. 2. Tracts upon doctrine, discipline, and morality. 3. Historical treatises, letters, and poems. Since that edition, there has been published an incredible number of tracts, poems, &c., ascribed to this author, most of which, in all probability, were not his.\n\nALCYON, the trivial name of a species of alcedo.

Through this lake Bacchus is said to have descended to hell, to bring back Semele; (Pausanias).\n\nALCYONIUS, Peter, a learned Italian, who flourished in the 16th century. He was well versed in the Greek and Latin tongues, and wrote some pieces of eloquence which met with great approbation. He was corrector of the press a considerable time for Aldus Manutius, and is entitled to a share in the praises given to the editions of that learned printer. He published a treatise concerning banishment, which contained so many fine passages intermixed with others quite the reverse, that it was thought he had tacked to somewhat of his own, several fragments of a treatise of Cicero de Gloria; and that afterwards, in order to save himself from being detected in this theft, he burnt the manuscript of Cicero, the only one extant. Paulus Manutius, in his commentary upon these words of Cicero, Librum tibi celeriter mittam de gloria, \"I will speedily send you my treatise on Glory;\" has the following passage relating to this affair: \"He means...\"\nAldborough (says he) his two books on Glory, which were handed down to the age of our fathers; for Bernard Jusfinian, in the index of his books, mentions Cicero de Gloria.\n\nThis treatise, however, when Bernard had left his whole library to a nunnery, could not be found, though sought after with great care: nobody doubted but Peter Alcyonius, who, being physician to the nunnery, was entrusted with the library, had safely stolen it. And truly, in his treatise Of Banishment, some things are found interspersed here and there, which seem not to favour of Alcyonius, but of some higher author.\" The two orations he made after the taking of Rome, wherein he represented very strongly the injustice of Charles V. and the barbarity of his soldiers, were excellent pieces. There is also an oration ascribed to him, on the knights who died at the siege of Rhodes.\n\nALDBOROUGH, a sea-port town of England in Suffolk. It is pleasantly situated, in a dale, between a high hill to the westward, on which its large old-built church stands; the sea to the east, and its river running south-west. It is a large, long, ordinary town, made up of two or three streets of low houses, running parallel to each other. A quarter of a mile to the south lies Slaughden, where they have a commodious key, with warehouses for fish: more southerly still, they have conveniences for drying their northsea fish. Their employment in the fishery is their chief business, which is considerable in the seasons for catching herrings and sprats; and it is the only place in England for curing red sprats. It is a town corporate, and sends two members to parliament. Towards the sea, it has some pieces of cannon planted for its defence. It is 88 miles north-east from London. E. Long. 1° 32'. N. Lat. 52° 50'.\n\nALDBOROUGH, a market-town in the west riding of Yorkshire, seated on the river Ouse, 15 miles north-west of York, and 200 miles north of London. It sends two members to parliament. W. Long. 0° 20'. N. Lat. 54° 15'. It was anciently a Roman city, called Iufirum Brigantum; and several coins and monuments of the Saxons and Romans have been discovered there.\n\nALDEBARAN, in Astronomy, a star of the first magnitude, called in English the bull's eye, as making the eye of the constellation Taurus. Its longitude is 6 deg. 32 min. 9 sec. of Gemini, and its latitude 5 deg. 29 min. 40 sec. south.\n\nALDER-TREE. See Betula, Botany Index.\n\nALDERHOLM, an island of Sweden, formed by the three arms of a river running through Gentle, a town of Nordland, in Sweden, 80 miles north from Stockholm. Here is a wharf, a repository for planks and deals, two packing houses, a large customhouse for taking toll of the ships, an arsenal for cannon, and a granary.\n\nALDERMAN, in the British policy, a magistrate subordinate to the lord-mayor of a city or town-corporate. The number of these magistrates is not limited, but is more or less according to the magnitude of the place. In London there are 26; each having one of the wards of the city committed to his care. This office is for life; so that when one of them dies, or resigns, a ward mote is called, who return two persons, one of whom the lord-mayor and aldermen choose to supply the vacancy. All the aldermen are justices of the peace, by a charter of 15 Geo. II. The aldermen of Alderman London, &c., are exempted from serving inferior offices; nor shall they be put upon offices, or serve on juries, so long as they continue to be aldermen.\n\nALDERMAN, among our Saxon ancestors, was a degree of nobility answering to earl or count at present.\n\nALDERMAN was also used, in the time of King Edgar, for a judge or justice. Thus we meet with the titles of aldermannus totius Anglie, aldermannus regis, comitatus, civitatis, burgi, cofelti, hundredi, five wapentachii, et novemdecimorum. According to Spelman, the aldermannus totius Anglie seems to have been the same officer who was afterwards styled capitulaius justiciarius Anglie, or chief justice of England; the aldermannus regis seems to have been an occasional magistrate, answering to our justice of assize; and the aldermannus comitatus, a magistrate who held a middle rank between what was afterward called the earl and the sheriff; he sat at the trial of causes with the bishop: the latter proceeding according to ecclesiastical law, and the former declaring and expounding the common law of the land.\n\nALDERNEY, an island in the British channel, subject to the crown of Great Britain. It is about eight miles in compass, and is separated from Cape la Hogue, in Normandy, by a narrow strait, called the Race of Alderney, which is a very dangerous passage in stormy weather when the two currents meet; otherwise it is safe, and has depth of water for the largest ships. Through this strait the French fleet made their escape after their defeat at La Hogue, in 1692. It is a healthy island, has but one church, is fruitful both in corn and pasture, and is remarkable for a fine breed of cows. The inhabitants, for their greater safety, live together in a town of the same name. The number of houses is said to be 200, and the inhabitants 1000. It has but one harbour, called Crabby, which is at a good distance from the town; and is only fit for small vessels. To the west lie the range of rocks called the Caletes, so dangerous to mariners. W. Long. 2° 17'. N. Lat. 49° 50'.\n\nALDHelm, or Adelm, St., bishop of Shireburn in the time of the Saxon Heptarchy. He is said to have been the son of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the West-Saxons; but, in the opinion of William of Malmesbury, his father was no more than a distant relation to the king. Having received the first part of his education in the school which one Macduff, a learned Scot, had set up in the place where Malmesbury now stands, he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement. At his return home, he studied some time under Adrian abbot of St Augustine's in Canterbury, the most learned professor of the sciences who had ever been in England. In these different seminaries he acquired a very uncommon stock of knowledge; and became famous for his learning, not only in England, but in foreign countries: whence several learned men sent him their writings for his perusal and correction; particularly Prince Arcivill, a son of the king of Scotland, who wrote many pieces which he sent to Aldhelm, \"entreating him to give them the last polish, by rubbing off their Scots ruff.\" He was the first Englishman who wrote in the Latin language both in prose and verse, and composed a book for the instruction of his countrymen in the profanity of that language. He\nAldhelm fades this, he wrote several other treatises on various subjects; some of which are lost, and others published by Martin Delrio and Cantius. Venerable Bede, who flourished in the end of this and the beginning of the next century, gives the following character of Aldhelm:\n\n\"He was a man of universal erudition, having an elegant style, and being wonderfully well acquainted with books, both on philosophical and religious subjects.\"\n\nIn fact, considering the cloud of ignorance by which he was surrounded, and the great difficulty of acquiring knowledge without proper instruction, Aldhelm was a very extraordinary man. From one of his letters to Hedda bishop of Winchester, concerning the nature of his studies whilst at Canterbury, he appears to have been indefatigably determined to acquire every species of learning in his power. For a copy of this curious epistle, see Henry's History, vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great declared, that Aldhelm was the best of all the Saxon poets; and that a favourite long, which was universally sung in his time, near 200 years after its author's death, was of his composition. When he was abbot of Malmesbury, having a fine voice, and great skill in music as well as poetry, and observing the backwardness of his barbarous countrymen to listen to grave instructions, he composed a number of little poems, which he sung to them after mass in the sweetest manner; by which they were gradually instructed and civilized. After this excellent person had governed the monastery of Malmesbury, of which he was the founder, about 30 years, he was made bishop of Shireburn, where he died A.D. 799.—He wrote, 1. De cultu vitis principalibus. This treatise is extant in Bibliotheca Patronum de Canisius. 2. Enigmatum verus mille. This, with several other of his poems, was published by Martin Delrio at Mentz, 8vo, 1651. 3. A book addressed to a certain king of Northumberland, named Alfrid, on various subjects. 4. De vita monachorum. 5. De laude sanctorum. 6. De arithmetica. 7. De astrologia. 8. A book against the mistake of the Britons concerning the celebration of Easter; printed by Sonius, 1576. 9. De laude virginis Mariae; manuscript, in Bennet-college, Cambridge; published among Bede's Opuscula. Besides many sonnets, epistles, and homilies in the Saxon language.\n\nALDPORT, an ancient name for Manchester. See MANCHESTER.\n\nALDRED, abbot of Tavistock, was promoted to the bishopric of Worcester in the year 1016. He was so much in favour with King Edward the Confessor, and had so much power over his mind, that he obliged him to be reconciled with the worst of his enemies, particularly with Sweyn son of the earl Goodwin, who had revolted against him, and came with an army to invade the kingdom. Aldred also restored the union and friendship between King Edward and Griffith king of Wales. He took afterwards a journey to Rome, and being returned into England, in the year 1054, he was sent ambassador to the emperor Henry II. He stayed a whole year in Germany, and was very honourably entertained by Herman archbishop of Cologne, from whom he learned many things relating to ecclesiastical discipline, which on his return he established in his own diocese. In the year 1058 he went to Jerusalem, which no archbishop or bishop of England had ever done before him. Two years after he returned to England; and Kinfin archbishop of York dying the 22d of December 1060, Aldred was elected in his stead on Christmas day following, and was permitted to retain the see of Worcester with the archbishopric of York, as some of his predecessors had done. Aldred went soon after to Rome, in order to receive the pall from the pope: He was attended by Tofton earl of Northumberland, Gilo bishop of Wells, and Walter bishop of Hereford. The pope received Tofton very honourably, and made him fit by him in the synod which he held against the simonists. He granted to Gilo and Walter their request, because they were tolerably well learned, and not accused of simony. But Aldred being by his answers found ignorant, and guilty of simony, the pope deprived him very severely of all his honours and dignities; so that he was obliged to return without the pall. On the way home he and his three fellow-travellers were attacked by some robbers, who took from them all that they had, though they did not offer to kill them. This obliged them to return to Rome; and the pope, either out of compassion, or by the threatenings of the earl of Northumberland, gave Aldred the pallium; but he was obliged to resign his bishopric of Worcester. However, as the archbishopric of York had been almost entirely ruined by the many invasions of foreigners, King Edward gave the new archbishop leave to keep 12 villages or manors which belonged to the bishopric of Worcester. Edward the Confessor dying in 1066, Aldred crowned Harold his successor. He also crowned William the Conqueror, after he had made him take the following oath, viz. that he would protect the holy churches of God and their leaders; that he would establish and observe righteous laws; that he would entirely prohibit and suppress all rapines and unjust judgements. He was so much in favour with the Conqueror, that this prince looked upon him as a father; and, though imperious in regard to everybody else, he yet submitted to obey this archbishop: John Brompton gives us an instance of the king's submission, which at the same time shows the prelate's haughtiness.—It happened one day, as the archbishop was at York, that the deputy-governor or lord-lieutenant going out of the city with a great number of people, met the archbishop's servants, who came to town with several carts and horses loaded with provisions. The governor asked them to whom they belonged; and they having answered they were Aldred's servants, the governor ordered that all these provisions should be carried to the king's storehouse. The archbishop sent immediately some of his clergy to the governor, commanding him to deliver the provisions, and to make satisfaction to St Peter, and to him the saint's vicar, for the injury he had done them; adding, that if he refused to comply, the archbishop would make use of his apostolic authority against him, (intimating thereby that he would excommunicate him). The governor, offended at this proud message, used the persons whom the archbishop had sent him very ill, and returned an answer as haughty as the message was. Aldred thereupon went to London to make his complaint to the king; but in this very complaint he acted with his wonted insolence; for meeting the king in the church of St Peter at Westminster, he spoke to him in these words: \"Hearken, O William: when thou wast but a foreigner, and God,\nGod, to punish the sins of this nation, permitted thee to become master of it, after having shed a great deal of blood; I consecrated thee, and put the crown upon thy head with blessings; but now, because thou hast deserved it, I pronounce a curse over thee, instead of a blessing, since thou art become the persecutor of God's church, and of his ministers, and hast broken the promises and the oaths which thou madest to me before St Peter's altar.\" The king, terrified at this discourse, fell upon his knees, and humbly begged the prelate to tell him, by what crime he had deserved so severe a sentence. The noblemen, who were present, were enraged against the archbishop, and loudly cried out he deserved death, or at least banishment, for having offered such an injury to his sovereign; and they pressed him with threatenings to raise the king from the ground. But the prelate, unmoved at all this, answered calmly, \"Good men, let him lie there, for he is not at Aldred's but at St Peter's feet; he must feel St Peter's power, since he dared to injure his viceregent.\" Having thus reproved the nobles by his episcopal authority, he vouchsafed to take the king by the hand, and to tell him the ground of his complaint. The king humbly excused himself, by saying he had been ignorant of the whole matter; and begged of the noblemen to entreat the prelate, that he might take off the curse he had pronounced, and to change it into a blessing. Aldred was at last prevailed upon to favour the king thus far; but not without the promise of several presents and favours, and only after the king had granted him to take such a revenge on the governor as he thought fit. Since that time (adds the historian) none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the least injury. It may be questioned, which was more surprising here, whether the archbishop's haughtiness, who dared to treat his sovereign after so unbecoming a manner; or the king's stupidity, who suffered such insolence and audacity from a priest?—The Danes having made an invasion in the north of England in the year 1668, under the conduct of Harold and Canute the sons of King Sweyn, Aldred was so much afflicted at it, that he died of grief the 11th of September in that same year, having befoiled God that he might not see the defolation of his church and country.\n\nALDRICH, ROBERT, bishop of Carlisle, was born at Burnham in Buckinghamshire about the year 1493, and educated at Eaton school; from whence, in 1507, he was elected scholar of King's college, Cambridge, where he took his degree in arts, and was afterwards proctor of the university. In 1525, he was appointed master of Eaton school, then became fellow of that college, and finally provost. In 1529, he went to Oxford, where, being first incorporated bachelor of divinity, in the following year he proceeded doctor in that faculty: in 1531, he was made archdeacon of Colchester; in 1534, canon of Windsor; and the same year, regitrary of the order of the garter. He was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in the year 1537, and died at Horncastle in Lincolnshire in 1556. He wrote,\n\n1. Epistle ad Gul. Hormanum, in Latin verse; printed in Horman's Antidoticon, Lond. 1521, of which book Pitts erroneously makes Aldrich the author.\n2. Epigrammata varia.\n3. Latin versae, and another epistle to Horman, prefixed to the Vulgariae puerorum of that author, Lond. 1519, 4to.\n4. Answers to certain queries concerning the abuses of the mass; also about receiving the sacrament.\n\nALDRICH, Dr Henry, an eminent English divine and philosopher, born at London in 1647, was educated at Westminster school under the famous Dr Bury, and admitted of Christ-church college, Oxford. He had a great share in the controversy with the Papists in the reign of James II. and Bishop Burnet ranks him among those who examined all the points of Popery with a solidity of judgment, clearness of argument, depth of learning, and vivacity of writing, far beyond any who had before that time written in our language. He rendered himself so conspicuous, that at the Revolution, when Massey the Popish dean of Christ-church fled, his deanery was conferred on him. In this station he behaved in an exemplary manner, and that fabric owes much of its beauty to his ingenuity: it was Aldrich who designed the beautiful square called Peckwater Quadrangle, which is esteemed an excellent piece of architecture. In imitation of his predecessor Dr Fell, he published, yearly, a piece of some ancient Greek author, as a present to the students of his house. He published A System of Logic, with some other pieces; and the reviling Clarendon's History of the Rebellion was intrusted to him and Bishop Spratt; but it doth not appear that they made any additions, or considerable alterations in it, as has been asserted by Mr Oldmixon. Besides his performances above mentioned, Dr Aldrich was also rector of Wen in Shropshire. He was chosen prolocutor of the convocation in 1702. This worthy person died at Christ-church on the 14th of December 1710. As to his character, he was a most universal scholar, and had a taste for all sorts of learning, especially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the public with several particulars relative to Dr Aldrich's skill in music; and on account of the Doctor's eminence in this respect, Sir John hath given his life, with his head prefixed. His abilities as a musician rank him, we are told, among the greatest masters of the science. He composed many services for the church, which are well known; as are also his anthems, nearly to the number of 20. He adapted, with great skill and judgment, English words to many of the notes of Palestrina, Carissimi, Victoria, and other Italian composers for the church, some of which are frequently sung in our cathedrals as anthems. By the happy talent which Dr Aldrich possessed, of naturalizing the compositions of the old Italian masters, and accommodating them to an English ear, he increased the stores of our own church. Though the Doctor chiefly applied himself to the cultivation of sacred music, yet, being a man of humour, he could divert himself by producing pieces of a lighter kind. There are two catches of his; the one, \"Hark the bonny Christchurch Bells;\" the other entitled, \"A Smoking Catch;\" to be sung by four men smoking their pipes, which is not more difficult to sing than diverting to hear. His love of smoking was, it seems, so excessive as to be an entertaining topic of discourse in the university. Such was Dr Aldrich's regard for the advancement of music, and the honour of its professors, that he had formed a design of writing a history of the science; and the materials from which he proposed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college. It appears from these materials, that he had marked\nmarked down every thing which he had met with concerning music and musicians; but that he had brought no part of them into any kind of form.\n\nDr Aldrich is of some note as a Latin poet. In the *Mulce Anglicane*, we find two elegant copies of verses by him; one on the accession of King William III., and the other on the death of the duke of Gloucester. Sir John Hawkins has preferred a humorous translation by him of the well-known English ballad,\n\n\"A soldier and a failor,\n\"A tinker and a tailor,\" &c.\n\nThe following epigram, entitled \"Causae Bibendi,\" is likewise ascribed to Dr Aldrich:\n\n\"Si bene quid movet, Causae sunt quinque bibendi,\n\"Hospitis Adventus; praesens Sitis, atque futura;\n\"Aut Vini Bonitas; aut qua liberat altera Causa.\"\n\nThe epigram has been thus translated:\n\n\"If on my theme I rightly think,\n\"There are five reasons why men drink:\n\"Good wine, a friend, because I'm dry,\n\"Or least I should be and bye,\n\"Or any other reason why.\"\n\nThe translation is not equal to the original. It is evident, from the verses cited and referred to, that Dr Aldrich was of a very cheerful and pleasant turn of mind. Indeed, he is always spoken of as having been a man of wit; and as one who, to his great talents and virtues, joined those amiable qualities which rendered him the object of general affection, as well as of general esteem and respect. Having never been married, he appropriated his income to works of hospitality and beneficence, and in encouraging learning to the utmost of his power, of which he was a most munificent patron, as well as one of the greatest men in England, if considered as a Christian or a gentleman. He had always the interest of his college at heart, whereof he was an excellent governor. His modesty and humility prevented him from prefixing his name to the learned tracts which he published during his life. At his death he wished to be buried in the cathedral without any memorial; which his thrifty nephew complied with, depositing him on the south side of Bishop Fell's grave, December 22, eight days after his decease; which happened in the 63rd or 64th year of his age.\n\nALDROVANDA. See Botany Index.\n\nALDROVANDUS, Ulysses, professor of philosophy and physic at Bologna, the place of his nativity. He was a most curious inquirer into natural history, and travelled into the most distant countries on purpose to inform himself of their natural productions. Minerals, metals, plants, and animals, were the objects of his curious researches; but he applied himself chiefly to birds, and was at great expense to have figures of them drawn from the life. Aubert le Mire says, that he gave a certain painter, famous in that art, a yearly salary of 200 crowns, for 30 years and upwards; and that he employed at his own expense Lorenzo Bennini and Cornelius Swintus, as well as the famous engraver Christopher Coriolanus. These expenses ruined his fortune, and at length reduced him to the utmost necessity; and it is said that he died blind in an hospital at Bologna, at a great age, in 1605.\n\nMr Bayle observes, that antiquity does not Alduabius, furnish us with an instance of a design so extensive and so laborious as that of Aldrovandus, with regard to natural history; that Pliny has treated of more kinds of subjects, but only touches lightly on them, saying but a little upon any thing, whereas Aldrovandus has collected all he could meet with. His compilation, or that compiled upon his plan, consists of 13 volumes in folio, several of which were printed after his death. He himself published his Ornithology, or History of Birds, in three folio volumes, in 1599; and his seven books of insects, which make another volume of the same size. The volume Of Serpents, three Of Quadrupeds, one Of Fishes, that Of exanguious Animals, the History of Monsters, with the Supplement to that of Animals, the treatise Of Metals, and the Dendrology or History of Trees, were published at several times after the death of Aldrovandus, by the care of different persons; and Aldrovandus is the sole author only of the first six volumes of this work, the rest having been finished and compiled by others, upon the plan of Aldrovandus: a most extensive plan, wherein he not only relates what he has read in naturalists, but remarks also what historians have written, legislators ordained, and poets feigned: he explains also the different uses which may be made of the things he treats of, in common life, in medicine, architecture, and other arts; in short, he speaks of morality, proverbs, devices, riddles, hieroglyphics, and many other things which relate to his subject.\n\nALDUABIS, in Ancient Geography, a river of Celtic Gaul, which rising from Mount Jura, separating the Sequani from the Helvetii, and running through the county of Burgundy, or the Franche Comté, environs almost on every side the city of Besançon; and running by Dole, falls into the Saône near Châlons. By Cæsar it is called Alduaflubis; in Ptolemy, Dubis: now le Doux.\n\nALE, a fermented liquor obtained from an infusion of malt, and differing from beer chiefly in having a less proportion of hops. (See Brewing.) This liquor, the natural substitute of wine in such countries as could not produce the grape, was originally made in Egypt, the first planted kingdom, on the dispersion from the east, that was supposed unable to produce grapes. And, as the Noachian colonies pierced further into the west, they found, or thought they found, the same defect, and supplied it in the same manner. Thus the natives of Spain, the inhabitants of France, and the aborigines of Britain, all used an infusion of barley for their ordinary liquor: and it was called by the various names of Galia and Ceria in the first country, Cerevita in the second, and Curmi in the last; all literally importing only the strong water.\n\n\"All the several nations (says Pliny) who inhabit the west of Europe, have a liquor with which they intoxicate themselves made of corn and water. The manner of making this liquor is somewhat different in Gaul, Spain, and other countries, and is called by many various names; but its nature and properties are everywhere the same. The people of Spain, in particular, brew this liquor so well, that it will keep good a long time. So exquisite is the cunning of mankind, in gratifying their vicious appetites, that they have thus invented a method to make water itself intoxicating.\"\nThe method in which the ancient Britons, and other Celtic nations, made their ale, is thus described by Isidorus and Orofius. \"The grain is steeped in water and made to germinate, by which its spirits are excited and set at liberty; it is then dried and ground; after which it is infused in a certain quantity of water; which being fermented, becomes a pleasant, warming, strengthening, and intoxicating liquor.\" This ale was most commonly made of barley; but sometimes of wheat, oats, and millet.\n\nAnciently the Welsh and Scots had also two kinds of ale, called common ale and spiced ale; and their value was thus ascertained by law: \"If a farmer hath no mead, he shall pay two casks of spiced ale, or four casks of common ale, for one cask of mead.\" By this law, a cask of spiced ale, nine palms in height, and 18 palms in diameter, was valued at a sum of money equal in efficacy to 7l. ro. of our present money; and a cask of common ale, of the same dimensions, at a sum equal to 3l. 15s. This is a sufficient proof, that even common ale in this period was an article of luxury among the Welsh, which could only be obtained by the great and opulent. Wine seems to have been quite unknown even to the kings of Wales, in this period, as it is not so much as once mentioned in their laws; though Giraldus Cambrensis, who flourished about a century after the Conquest, acquaints us, that there was a vineyard in his time at Maenarper, near Pembroke, in South Wales.\n\nAle was the favourite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, as it had been of their ancestors the ancient Germans. Before their conversion to Christianity, they believed that drinking large and frequent draughts of ale was one of the chief felicities which those heroes enjoyed who were admitted into the hall of Odin.\n\nThere are various sorts of ale known in Britain, particularly pale and brown: the former is brewed from malt slightly dried; and is esteemed more efficacious than the latter, which is made from malt more highly dried or roasted.\n\nPale ale brewed with hard waters, as those of springs and wells, is judged the most wholesome, in regard the mineral particles tend to prevent the cohesions of those drawn from the grain, and enable them to pass the proper filtrations the better; softer waters, as those of rivers, and rain, seem better suited to draw out the substance of high-dried malts, which retain many igneous particles, best absorbed in a smooth vehicle.\n\nIn Staffordshire, they have a secret of fining ale in a very short time. Plot conjectures it to be done by adding alum, or vinegar, in the working.\n\nAle is prepared various ways, and of various ingredients, as of wheat, rye, millet, oats, barley, the berries of the quickbean, &c.\n\nSome have found that the juice which bleeds from the birch or yew tree is of great use on this occasion, applied instead of water. It makes one bushel of malt go as far as four in the common way.\n\nSome have a method of preparing ale, so that it will keep, carried to the East or West Indies. The secret is, by mashing twice with fresh malt; boiling twice; and, after skimming it, putting to every five gallons two new-laid eggs whole, to remain therein. It is said, that in a fortnight's time, the shells will be dissolved; and the eggs become like wind-eggs; and that afterwards the white would disappear and the yolk remain untouched.\n\nThe consumption of ale in these kingdoms is incredible. It was computed twenty years ago at the value of four millions yearly, including Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe duties on ale and beer make a principal branch of the revenue in Britain. They were first imposed by the 12th of Car. II., and have been continued by several subsequent acts of parliament to first Geo. III., which lays an additional duty of 3d. per barrel. In the whole, the brewer of ale and beer for sale shall pay 8s. for every barrel of either, above 6s. a barrel; and for every barrel of 6s. or under, the sum of 1s. 4d.\n\nMedicated Ales, those wherein medicinal herbs have been infused, or added during the fermentation.\n\nGill Ale, is that in which the dried leaves of gill or ground-ivy have been infused. It is esteemed ablerive and vulnerary, and consequently good in disorders of the breast and obstructions of the vitreous.\n\nAle Conner, an officer in London, who inspects the measures used in public houses. There are four ale conners, who are all chosen by the liverymen in common hall on Midsummer day.\n\nAlehouses must be licensed by justices of the peace, who take recognizances of the persons licensed, and of their sureties, viz. 10l. each, that they will not suffer unlawful gaming, nor other disorderly practices in their houses. Every person, excepting those who sell ale in fairs, neglecting to procure a license, is liable to a penalty of 40s. for the first offence, 4l. for the second, and 6l. for the third, with all costs. The license granted on the first of September, or within twenty days after, at a general meeting of the justices for the division to which he belongs, upon his producing a certificate to his character, unless, by living in a city or town-corporate, this last circumstance is dispensed with, and continues in force for one year only.\n\nAlehouse-keepers, selling ale in short measure, are liable to a penalty not exceeding 40s. and not less than 10s. and likewise to a fine of 10s. for permitting tipping, &c.\n\nBy 29th Geo.

This is otherwise called Alectryomancy; of which there appear to have been different species. But that most spoken of by authors was in the following manner: A circle was described on the ground, and divided into twenty-four equal portions; in each of these spaces was written one of the letters of the alphabet, and on each of the letters was laid a grain of wheat; after which, a cock being turned loose in the circle, particular notice was taken of the grains picked up by the cock, because the letters under them, being formed into a word, made the answer desired. It was thus, according to Zonaras, that Libanius and Jamblicus sought who should succeed the emperor Valens; and the cock eating the grains answering to the spaces ΘΕΟΑ, several whose names began with those letters, as Theodotus, Theodites, Theodulus, &c. were put to death; which did not hinder, but promote, Theodosius to the succession. But the story, however current, is but ill supported: It has been called in question by some, and refuted by others, from the silence of Marcellinus, Socrates, and other historians of that time.\n\nALEE, in the sea language, a term only used when the wind, crossing or flanking the line of a ship's course, presses upon the masts and sails so as to make her incline to one side, which is called the lee-side: hence, when the helm is moved over to this side, it is said to be alee, or hard-a-lee.\n\nALEGAMBE, PHILIP, a celebrated Jesuit, born at Brussels in 1592, distinguished himself by publishing a Bibliotheca of the writers of his order, and died at Rome in 1652.\n\nALEGRETE, a small town of Portugal, in Alentejo, on the confines of Port Alegre, on the river Caja, which falls into the Guadiana, a little below Badajoz, near the frontiers of Spanish Extremadura. It is a very pretty town, and finely situated; seven miles south-east of Port Alegre, and thirty north of Elvas. W. Long. 5° 20'. N.

After the Marcomanni and their allies had removed from the Rhine, a rabble, or collection of people from all parts of Gaul, as the term Alemanni denotes, prompted either by levity or poverty, occupied the lands, called Decumates by Tacitus, because they held them on a tithe; now supposed to be the duchy of Wurtemberg. Such appear to have been the first beginnings of Alemannia, which was in after-times greatly enlarged; but till it was considered as a distinct part; for Caracalla, who conquered the Alemanni, assumed the surname both of Alemannicus and Germanicus.\n\nALEMBARD, an officer in the court of the Grand Signior, who bears the green standard of Mahomet, when the sultan appears in public on any solemn occasion.\n\nALEMBERT, JOHN LE ROND D', an eminent French philosopher, was born at Paris in 1717. He derived the name of John le Rond from that of the church near which, after his birth, he was exposed as a foundling. His father, informed of this circumstance, listened to the voice of nature and duty, took measures for the proper education of his child, and for his future subsistence in a state of ease and independence.\n\nHe received his first education in the College of the Four Nations, among the Janissaries, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the first year of his philosophical studies, he composed a Commentary on the Epistle of St Paul to the Romans. The Janissaries considered this production as an omen that portended to the party of Port-Royal a restoration to some\nAlembert, some part of their ancient splendour, and hoped to find one day in M. d'Alembert a second Pascal. To render this resemblance more complete, they engaged their rising pupil in the study of the mathematics; but they soon perceived that his growing attachment to this science was likely to disappoint the hopes they had formed with respect to his future destination; they therefore endeavoured to divert him from this line; but their endeavours were fruitless.\n\nAt his leaving college, he found himself alone and unconnected in the world; and sought an asylum in the house of his nurse. He comforted himself with the hope, that his fortune, though not ample, would better the condition and subsistence of that family, which was the only one that he could consider as his own: Here, therefore, he took up his residence, resolving to apply himself entirely to the study of geometry; And here he lived, during the space of forty years, with the greatest simplicity, discovering the augmentation of his means only by increasing displays of his beneficence, concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from the honest people, and making their plain and uncouth manners the subject of good-natured pleasantry and philosophical observation. His good nurse perceived his ardent activity; heard him mentioned as the writer of many books; but never took it into her head that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compassion. \"You will never,\" said she to him one day, \"be anything but a philosopher—and what is a philosopher?—a fool, who toils and plagues himself during his life, that people may talk of him when he is no more.\"\n\nAs M. d'Alembert's fortune did not far exceed the demands of necessity, his friends advised him to think of a profession that might enable him to augment it. He accordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in that line; but soon abandoned this plan, and applied to the study of medicine. Geometry, however, was always drawing him back to his former pursuits; and after many ineffectual efforts to resist its attractions, he renounced all views of a lucrative profession, and gave himself over entirely to mathematics and poverty.\n\nIn the year 1741 he was admitted member of the Academy of Sciences; for which distinguished literary promotion, at such an early age, he had prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work*, which was deemed classical in France in the line of geometry. He afterwards let himself examine, with deep attention and assiduity, what must be the motion of a body which passes from one fluid into another more dense, in a direction not perpendicular to the surface separating the two fluids. Every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this case, and which amuses children under the denomination of Ducks and Drakes; but M. d'Alembert was the first who explained it in a satisfactory and philosophical manner.\n\nTwo years after his election to a place in the academy, he published his Treatise on Dynamics. The new principle developed in this treatise consisted in establishing equality, at each instant, between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them; or, to express the thing otherwise, in separating into two parts the action of the moving powers, and considering the one as producing alone the motion of the body in the second instant, and the other as employed to destroy that which had been in the first.\n\nSo early as the year 1744, M. d'Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before solved by geometers became, in some measure, its corollaries. The discovery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the first trials of which were published in a Discourse on the general Theory of the Winds, to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of M. d'Alembert.\n\nHe availed himself of the favourable circumstance of the king of Prussia having just terminated a glorious campaign by an honourable peace, and in allusion to this dedicated his work to that prince in the three following Latin verses:\n\nHac ego de ventis, dum ventorum ocyor alit,\nPalantes agit Aultriacos Fredericus, et orbis,\nInsignis lauro, ramum pretendent olivae.\n\nSwifter than wind, while of the winds I write,\nThe foes of conquering Frederick speed their flight,\nWhile laurel o'er the hero's temple bends\nTo the tir'd world the olive branch he sends.\n\nThis flattering dedication procured the philosopher a polite letter from Frederick, and a place among his literary friends.\n\nIn the year 1747 d'Alembert applied his new calculus of \"Partial Differences\" to the problem of vibrating chords, whose solution, as well as the theory of the oscillations of the air and the propagation of sound, had been given but incompletely by the geometers who preceded him, and these were his masters or his rivals.\n\nIn the year 1749 he furnished a method of applying his principle to the motion of any body of a given figure; and he solved the problem of the precession of the equinoxes, determined its quantity, and explained the phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis discovered by Dr. Bradley.\n\nIn 1752, M. d'Alembert published a treatise on the Resistance of Fluids, to which he gave the modest title of an Essay; but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new observations. About the same time he published, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, Researches concerning the Integral Calculus, which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in the present century.\n\nWhile the studies of M. d'Alembert were confined to geometry, he was little known or celebrated in his native country. His connexions were limited to a small society of select friends; he had never seen any man in high office except Mellors d'Argenson. Satisfied with an income which furnished him with the necessaries of life, he did not aspire after opulence or honours, nor had they been hitherto bestowed upon him, as it is easier to confer them on those who solicit them than to look out for men who deserve them. His cheerful conversation, his smart and lively fancies, a happy knack at telling a story, a singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart, and of delicacy of\nof wit with simplicity of manners, rendered him a pleasing and interesting companion, and his company consequently was much sought after in the fashionable circles. His reputation, at length, made its way to the throne, and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received also a pension from government, which he owed to the friendship of Count d'Argenson.\n\nThe tranquillity of M. d'Alembert was abated when his fame grew more extensive, and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and enlightened taste for literature and philosophy accompanied his mathematical genius. Our author's eulogist attributes to envy, detraction, and to other motives equally ungenerous, all the disapprobation, opposition, and censure that M. d'Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedic Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None surely will refuse the well-deserved tribute of applause to the eminent displays of genius, judgment, and true literary taste, with which M. d'Alembert has enriched the great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Discourse he has affixed to it; concerning the rise, progress, connexions, and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the first productions of which the philosophy of the present age can boast, and will be regarded as a striking specimen of just arrangement and sound criticism, and also as a model of accurate thinking and elegant writing.\n\nSome time after this, d'Alembert published his Philosophical, Historical, and Philological Miscellanies. These were followed by the Memoirs of Christina queen of Sweden; in which M. d'Alembert showed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold enough to assert them. His Essay on the Intercourse of Men of Letters with Persons high in Rank and Office, wounded the former to the quick, as it exposed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of those servile chains, which they feared to shake off, or were proud to wear. A lady of the court hearing one day the author accused of having exaggerated the despotism of the great, and the submission they require, answered flippantly, \"If he had consulted me, I would have told him more of the matter.\"\n\nM. d'Alembert gave very elegant specimens of his literary abilities in his translations of some select pieces of Tacitus. But these occupations did not divert him from his mathematical studies: for about the same time he enriched the Encyclopédie with a multitude of excellent articles in that line, and composed his Researches on several important Points of the System of the World, in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the solution of the problem of the perturbations of the planets, that had several years before been presented to the Academy.\n\nIn 1759 he published his Elements of Philosophy: a work extolled as remarkable for its precision and perspicuity; in which, however, are some tenets relative both to metaphysics and moral science, that are far from being admissible.\n\nThe resentment that was kindled (and the disputes that followed it) by the article Geneva, inserted in the Encyclopédie, are well known. M. d'Alembert did not leave this field of controversy with flying colours. Voltaire was an auxiliary in the contest: but as, in point of candour and decency, he had no reputation to lose; and as he weakened the blows of his enemies, by throwing both them and the spectators into fits of laughter, the illuse of the war gave him little uneasiness. It fell more heavily on d'Alembert; and exposed him, even at home, to much contradiction and opposition.\n\nIt was on this occasion that the late king of Prussia offered him an honourable asylum at his court, and the place of president of his academy; and was not offended at his refusal of these distinctions, but cultivated an intimate friendship with him during the rest of his life. He had refused, some time before this, a proposal made by the empress of Russia to intrust him with the education of the grand duke—a proposal accompanied with all the flattering offers that could tempt a man ambitious of titles, or desirous of making an ample fortune: but the objects of his ambition were tranquillity and study.\n\nIn the year 1765, he published his Dissertation on the Destruction of the Jesuits. This piece drew upon him a swarm of adversaries, who confirmed the merit and credit of his work by their manner of attacking it.\n\nBeside the works already mentioned, he published nine volumes of memoirs and treatises, under the title of Opuscules; in which he has solved a multitude of problems relative to astronomy, mathematics, and natural philosophy; of which our panegyrist gives a particular account, more especially of those which exhibit new subjects, or new methods of investigation.\n\nHe published also Elements of Music; and rendered, at length, the system of Rameau intelligible; but he did not think the mathematical theory of the sonorous body sufficient to account for the rules of that art. He was always fond of music; which, on the one hand, is connected with the most subtle and learned researches of rational mechanics; while, on the other, its power over the senses and the soul exhibits to philosophers phenomena no less singular, and still more inexplicable.\n\nIn the year 1772, he was chosen secretary to the French academy. He formed, soon after this preferment, the design of writing the lives of all the deceased academicians from 1700 to 1772; and in the space of three years he executed this design, by composing 70 eulogies.\n\nM. d'Alembert died on the 28th of October 1783. There were many amiable lines of candour, modesty, disinterestedness, and benevolence, in his moral character; which are described, with a diffusive detail, in his eulogy, by M. Condorcet, Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences, 1783.\n\nALEMBIC, a chemical vessel usually made of glass or copper, formerly used for distillation. The bottom part, which contained the subject for distillation, is called, from its shape, the cucurbit; the upper part, which receives and condenses the steam, is called the head, the beak of which is fitted into the neck of a receiver. Retorts, and the common worm-tube, are now more generally employed.\n\nALEMBROTH, in the writings of the alchemists, a word used for a sort of fixed alkaline salt, which had the power of the famous alkahest, in dissolving bodies, opening the pores of most or all known substances, and hence,\nALE\n\nthence, as well as by destroying sulphurs, promoting the separation of metals from their ores.—It is also used for a compound of corrosive mercury and sal ammoniac.\n\nALENIO, Julius, a Jesuit, born at Brescia in the republic of Venice. He travelled into the eastern countries; and arrived at Macao in 1610, where he taught mathematics. From thence he went to the empire of China, where he continued to propagate the Christian religion for thirty-six years. He was the first who planted the faith in the province of Xanfi, and he built several churches in the province of Fokien. He died in August 1649, leaving behind him several works in the Chinese language.\n\nALENTEJO, a province of Portugal, between the rivers Tajo and Guadiana: the soil is very fertile, and the inhabitants laborious and industrious. The principal town is Evora.\n\nALENZON, a town of France, the capital of the department of Orne, in Lower Normandy. It is surrounded with good walls, and flanked with towers. The castle was formerly a place of great consequence, and has held out long sieges. It has but one parish church, which has a bold and noble front. Among the numeraries, that of St Clair is most remarkable. It is seated on the river Sarthe, in a vast open plain, which produces all sorts of corn and fruit. Near it there are quarries of stone fit for building, wherein are found a fort like Bristol stones. The trade of Alençon is in linen, lace, stuffs, and leather. It is 20 miles north of Mons, 63 south-west of Rouen, and 88 south-west of Paris. Long. o. 10. N. Lat. 48. 25.\n\nALEPPO, or HALAB, the capital of a pachalic, and of all Syria, and the ordinary residence of the pacha, is situated in the vast plain which extends from the Orontes to the Euphrates, and which towards the south terminates in the desert. It is built on eight hills or eminences, on the highest of which the castle is erected, and is supposed to be the ancient Beræa. This mount is of a conic form, and seems in a great measure to be raised with the earth thrown up out of a deep broad ditch which surrounds it. The suburbs to the north-east are next in height to this, and those to the west-south-west are much lower than the parts adjacent, and than any other part of the city. The houses are large and commodious, having terraces on their tops, and generally sky-lights in form of a dome to let the light into the rooms, which from their loftiness, the gilding on the window shutters, cupboard-doors, &c. have at first entrance a very grand and agreeable effect. They are all so equal in height, that there are seldom any steps to ascend or descend in going from one house to another; while several large vaulted streets increase the facility of communication, by affording a passage to every part of the city free from the embarrassment of the open streets. They are carefully paved; have gutters and a foot-pavement on each side; and the middle of the street is laid with brick, the small end upwards, for the convenience of the horses. There is also a cleanliness observed here unknown to the other cities of Turkey, and which is not attended with the trouble of our scavengers, there being also drivers who go about the city and take up the rubbish and dust, which each inhabitant is obliged to sweep together; and though the heat of the climate renders this labour more easy, the same heat obliges them to greater cleanliness in order to preserve the salubrity of the air.\n\nThe mosques in Aleppo are numerous, and some few of them magnificent. Before each of them is an area, with a fountain in the middle, designed for ablutions before prayers; and behind some of the larger there are little gardens. There are many large khans, or caravanserais, consisting of a capacious square, on all sides of which are a number of rooms, built on a ground-floor, used occasionally for chambers, warehouses, or stables. Above stairs there is a colonnade or gallery on every side, in which are the doors of a number of small rooms, wherein the merchants, as well strangers as natives, transact most of their business.\n\nThe bazars or market-places are long covered narrow streets, on each side of which are a great number of small shops, just sufficient to hold the tradesman and his goods, the buyer being obliged to stand without. Each separate branch of business has a particular bazar, which is locked up, as well as the streets, an hour and a half after sunset: but the locks are of wood, though the doors are cased with iron. The slaughter-houses are in the suburbs, open to the fields. The tanners have a khan to work in near the river. To the southward in the suburbs they burn lime; and a little beyond that there is a village where they make ropes and catgut. On the opposite side of the river, to the westward, there is a glass-house, where they make a coarse white glass, in the winter only; for the greatest part of this manufacture is brought from a village 35 miles westward.\n\nThe situation of Aleppo, beside the advantage of a rich and fruitful soil, possesses also that of a stream of fresh water, which never becomes dry. This rivulet, which is about as large as that of the Gebeline at Paris, or the New River near London, rises in the mountains of Antab, and terminates six leagues below Aleppo, in a morass full of wild boars and pelicans. Near Aleppo, its banks, instead of the naked rocks which line them in the upper part of its course, are covered with a fertile earth, and laid out in gardens, or rather orchards, which in a hot country, and especially in Turkey, cannot but be delightful. The city is in itself one of the most agreeable in Syria, and is perhaps the cleanest and best built of any in Turkey. On whatever side it is approached, its numerous minarets and domes present an agreeable prospect to the eye, fatigued with the continued sameness of the brown and parched plains. In the centre is an artificial mountain surrounded by a dry ditch, on which is a ruinous fortress. From hence we have a fine prospect of the whole city, and to the north discover the snowy tops of the mountains of Bailan; and on the west, those which separate the Orontes from the sea; while to the south, and east, the eye can discern as far as the Euphrates. In the time of Omar, this castle stopped the progress of the Arabs for several months, and was at last taken by treachery, but at present would not be able to resist the feeblest assault. Its flight wall, low, and without a buttress, is in ruins; its little old towers are in no better condition; and it has not four cannon fit for service, not excepting a culverine nine feet long, taken from the Persians at the siege of Bailora. Three hundred and fifty Janizaries, who should\nAleppo should form the garrison, are busy in their shops, and the aga scarcely finds room in it to lodge his retinue. It is remarkable that this aga is named immediately by the Porte, which, ever fulficial, divides as much as possible the different offices. Within the walls of the castle is a well, which, by means of a subterraneous communication, derives its water from a spring a league and a quarter distant. In the environs of the city, we find a number of large square stones, on the top of which is a turban of stone, which are so many tombs. There are many rising grounds round it, which, in case of a siege, would greatly facilitate the approaches of the assailants. Such, among others, is that on which the house of the Dervishes stands, and which commands the canal and the rivulet: Aleppo, therefore, cannot be esteemed a place of importance in war, though it be the key of Syria to the north; but, considered as a commercial city, it has a different appearance. It is the emporium of Armenia and Diarbekar; sends caravans to Bagdad and into Persia; and communicates with the Persian gulf and India, by Baffora, with Egypt and Mecca by Damascus, and with Europe by Scanderoon (Alexandretta) and Latakia. Commerce is there principally carried on by barter. The chief commodities are raw or spun cottons, clumsy linens fabricated in the villages, silk stuffs manufactured in the city, copper, bourres (coarse cloths) like those of Rouen, goats hair brought from Natolia, the gall nuts of the Kourdestan, the merchandise of India, such as shawls and muslins, and pif-tachio nuts of the growth of the neighbourhood. The articles supplied by Europe are the Languedoc cloths, cochineal, indigo, sugar, and some other groceries. The coffee of America, though prohibited, is introduced, and serves to mix with that of Moka. The French have at Aleppo a consul and seven counting-houses; the English and the Venetians two, and the merchants of Leghorn and Holland one. The emperor appointed a consul there in 1784, in the person of a rich Jew merchant, who shaved his beard to assume the uniform and the sword. Russia has also sent one very lately. Aleppo is not exceeded in extent by any city in Turkey, except Constantinople and Cairo, and perhaps Smyrna. The number of inhabitants has been computed at 200,000; but in these calculations certainty is impossible. However, if we observe that this city is not larger than Nantes or Marseilles, and that the houses consist only of one story, we shall perhaps not think it probable they exceed 100,000. The people of this city, both Turks and Christians, are with reason esteemed the most civilized in all Turkey; and the European merchants nowhere enjoy so much liberty, or are treated with so much respect.\n\nThe air of Aleppo is very dry and piercing, but at the same time very salubrious for all who are not troubled with asthmatic complaints. The city, however, and the environs, are subject to a singular endemic disorder, which is called the ringworm or pimple of Aleppo: it is in fact a pimple which is at first inflammatory, and at length becomes an ulcer of the size of the nail. The usual duration of this ulcer is one year; it commonly fixes on the face, and leaves a scar which disfigures almost all the inhabitants. It is alleged that every stranger who resides there three months is attacked with it; experience has taught that the best mode of treatment is to make use of no remedy. No reason is assigned for this malady: but M. Volney supposes it proceeds from the quality of the water, as it is likewise frequent in the neighbouring villages, in some parts of Diarbekar, and even in certain districts near Damascus, where the soil and the water have the same appearances. Of the Christian inhabitants the greater number are Greeks, next to them the Armenians, then the Syrians, and lastly the Maronites; each of whom have a church in the city called Judda; in which quarter, and the parts adjacent, most of them reside. The common language is the vulgar Arabic, but the Turks of condition use the Turkish. Most of the Armenians can speak the Armenian, some few Syrians understand Syriac, and many of the Jews Hebrew; but scarce one of the Greeks understand a word of Greek. The people in general are of a middle stature, and tolerably well proportioned; but they seem neither vigorous nor active. Both sexes are handsome when young; but the beard soon disfigures the men; and the women, as they come early to maturity, also fade very soon; females are generally married from 14 to 18 years of age, and many under 14. The people of rank here are polite and affable, making allowances for that superiority which the Mahometan religion inflicts its votaries to assume over all who hold a different faith. Their bread is generally of wheat flour made into thin cakes, but very ill prepared, and is generally eaten as soon as it comes out of the oven. The principal people have small loaves of a finer flour, which are well fermented and baked. Besides these, there is a variety of biscuits, most of which are sprinkled on the top with some kind of seeds. The Europeans have very good bread, baked and prepared in the French manner. All the inhabitants of both sexes smoke tobacco to great excess; even the very servants have almost constantly a pipe in their mouths. Coaches or carriages are not used here; therefore persons of quality ride on horseback in the city, with a number of servants walking before them, according to their rank: ladies of the first distinction are even compelled to walk on foot in the city, or to any place at a moderate distance; in longer journeys they are carried by mules, in a kind of couch close covered up. There are a number of public bagnios in this city, which are used by people of all ranks, except those of the highest distinction, who commonly have baths and every other convenience in their own houses. Aleppo is 70 miles east of Scanderoon, on the sea-coast, and 175 north-by-east of Damascus. F. Long, 37° 42'. N. Lat. 36° 12'.\n\nAleppo, The Pachalic of, one of the five governments into which Syria is divided. It comprehends the country extending from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean, between two lines, one drawn from Scanderoon to Beer, along the mountains: the other from Beles to the sea, by Mara and the bridge of Shoger. This space principally consists of two plains; that of Antioch to the west, and that of Aleppo to the east: the north and the sea-coast are occupied by considerably high mountains, known to the ancients by the names of Amanus and of Rhodus. In general, the soil of this government is fat and loamy. The lofty and vigorous plants which shoot up everywhere after the winter rains prove its fertility, but its actual fruitfulness is but little. The greatest part of the lands lie waste;\nAleppo. waste; scarcely can we trace any marks of cultivation in the environs of the towns and villages. Its principal produce consists in wheat, barley, and cotton, which are found especially in the flat country. In the mountains, they rather choose to cultivate the vine, mulberry, olive, and fig trees. The sides of the hills towards the sea-coast are appropriated to tobacco, and the territory of Aleppo to pistachios. The pasturage is not to be reckoned, because that is abandoned to the wandering hordes of the Turcomans and Kurds.\n\nIn the greater part of the pachalics the pacha is, as his title imports, at once the viceroy and farmer-general of the country; but in that of Aleppo he does not possess the latter office. This the Porte has bestowed on a mehafiz or collector, who is immediately accountable for what he receives. His lease is only for a year. The present rent of his farm is 800 purses (above 40,000l.) but to this must be added the price of the babouches (Turkish slippers), or a present of three or four thousand pounds, to purchase the favour of the vizier, and men in office. For these two sums the farmer receives all the duties of the government; which are, first, the produce of import and export duties on merchandise coming from Europe, India, and Constantinople, and on that exported in exchange. Secondly, the taxes paid by the herds of cattle brought every year by the Turcomans and Kurds from Armenia and Diarbekir, to be sold in Syria. Thirdly, the fifth of the salt-works of Djeboul. And lastly, the miri, or land-tax. These united may produce about 60,000l.\n\nThe pacha, deprived of this lucrative branch of the administration, receives a fixed allowance of about 8300l. This revenue has always been inadequate to the expenses; for, besides the troops he is obliged to maintain, and the reparation of the highways and fortresses, the expenses of which he is obliged to defray, he is under the necessity of making large presents to the ministers, in order to keep his place; but the Porte adds to the account the contributions he may levy on the Kurds and Turcomans, and his extortions from the villages and individuals; nor do the pachas come short of this calculation. Abdi Pacha, who governed 13 or 14 years ago, carried off, at the end of 15 months, upwards of 160,000l. by laying under contribution every trade, even the very cleaners of tobacco-pipes; and very lately another of the same name has been obliged to fly for similar oppressions. The former was rewarded by the divan with the command of an army against the Ruffians; but if the latter has not enriched himself, he will be strangled as an extortioner. Such is the ordinary progress of affairs in Turkey!\n\nIn consequence of such wretched government, the greater part of the pachalics in the empire are impoverished and laid waste. This is the case in particular with that of Aleppo. In the ancient defters, or registers of imposts, upwards of 3200 villages were reckoned; but at present the collector can scarcely find 400. Such of our merchants as have resided there 20 years, have themselves seen the greater part of the environs of Aleppo become depopulated. The traveller meets with nothing but houses in ruins, cisterns rendered useless, and fields abandoned. Those who cultivate them have fled into the towns, where the population is absorbed, but where at least the individual conceals himself among the crowd from the rapacious hand of depotifin.\n\nALERIA, ALALIA, or ALARIA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Carthage, situated near the middle of the east side of the island, on an eminence, near the mouth of the river Rotanus mentioned by Ptolemy; built by the Phocaens (Diodorus Siculus). Afterwards Sylla led a colony thither. It is now in ruins, and called Aleria Diffracta.\n\nALES, ALEXANDER, a celebrated divine of the confession of Augsburg, was born at Edinburgh the 23d of April 1500. He soon made a considerable progress in school divinity, and entered the lists very early against Luther, this being then the great controversy in fashion, and the grand field wherein all authors, young and old, used to display their abilities. Soon after, he had a share in the dispute which Patrick Hamilton maintained against the ecclesiastics, in favour of the new faith he had imbibed at Marburg. He endeavoured to bring him back to the Catholic religion; but this he could not effect, and even began himself to doubt about his own religion, being much affected by the discourse of this gentleman, and still more by the constancy he showed at the stake, where David Beaton, archbishop of St Andrew's, caused him to be burnt. Beginning thus to waver, he was himself persecuted with so much violence, that he was obliged to retire into Germany, where he became at length a perfect convert to the Protestant religion. The change of religion which happened in England after the marriage of Henry VIII. with Anna Bullen, induced Ales to go to London in 1535. He was highly esteemed by Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury, Latimer, and Thomas Cromwell, who were at that time in high favour with the king. Upon the fall of these favourites, he was obliged to return to Germany; where the elector of Brandenburg appointed him professor of divinity at Frankfort upon the Oder, in 1540. But leaving this place upon some disgust, he returned to Leipzig, where he was chosen professor of divinity, and died in March 1565. He wrote a Commentary on St John, on the Epistles to Timothy, and on the Psalms, &c.\n\nALESA, ALESA, or HALESA, in Ancient Geography, a town of Sicily, on the Tyrrhenian sea, built according to Diodorus Siculus, by Archonides of Herbita, in the second year of the 94th Olympiad, or 423 years before Christ; situated on an eminence about a mile from the sea; now in ruins. It enjoyed immunity from taxes under the Romans (Diodorus, Cicero). The inhabitants were called Halici (Cicero, Pliny); also Alefimi, and Alefimi.\n\nALESHAM, a small neat town in Norfolk. It is 15 miles north of Norwich, and 121 north-east-by-north of London. E. Long. 0° 30'. N. Lat. 52° 53'. The town consists of about 400 houses.\n\nALESIA, in Ancient Geography, called Alexia by Livy and others; a town of the Mandubii, a people of Celtic Gaul; situated, according to Caesar, on a very high hill, whose foot was washed on two sides by two rivers. The town was of such antiquity, that Diodorus Siculus relates it was built by Hercules. It is supposed to be the city of Alife, in the duchy of Burgundy, not far from Dijon.\n\nALET, a town of France, in the department of the Aude,\nALETRIS Aude, and district of Limoux, at the foot of the Pyrenees. It is remarkable for its baths, and for the grains of gold and silver found in the stream which runs from the Pyrenean mountains, at the foot of which it stands. It is seated on the river Aude, 15 miles south of Carcassonne, and 37 north-west of Narbonne. E. Long. 2. 5. N. Lat. 42. 59.\n\nALETRIS. See Botany Index.\n\nALETUM, or Aleta, in Ancient Geography, a town of Celtic Gaul, now extinct. From its ruins arose St Malo in Brittany, at the distance of a mile. Its ruins are called Guich Alet in the British.\n\nALEURITES. See Botany Index.\n\nALEUROMANCY, the same with what was otherwise called aphitomantia, and criromantia; and means an ancient kind of divination performed by means of meal or flour.\n\nALEUTIAN, or Aleutsky Islands, a group or chain of islands on the north-east side of Kamchatka, and near the continent of America, which are subject to Russia. Part of these islands were discovered by Bering in the year 1741, and the rest at different periods since that time. Captain Cook visited these islands in 1778, and directed his researches and observations to a survey of them and of the adjacent coasts of Asia and America. On the Aleutian islands and the neighbouring coast, the Russians have formed numerous establishments for the support of the fur-trade, which is one of the most advantageous commercial concerns to the Russian empire. Captain Billings, who was sent out by the late empress Catherine to make discoveries in the north-east sea, explored, in the summer 1790, the whole chain of these islands. They seem to be of volcanic origin; have no wood, but what floats from sea; and lie between the 51st and the 66th degrees N. Lat. and the 164th and the 197th degrees of E. Long.\n\nALEXANDER THE GREAT, king of Macedonia. His father Philip laid the plan of that extensive empire, which his son afterwards completed. Philip, having made himself master of Greece, began to cast his eyes upon Persia, with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the injuries of former times. It was the popular topic of the day. But this prince was cut off in the midst of his enterprise. Such, however, was the influence of Alexander in the assembly of the Grecian states, that he was created general of their combined forces in the room of his father. Having made every needful preparation, at the head of a veteran army he invaded Asia. The lieutenants of Darius, who was then king of Persia, opposed him at the river Granicus, where Alexander obtained a complete victory, after which he pursued his march through Asia. At Issus, near Scanderoon, he was met by Darius in person, at the head of a prodigious army. Here he obtained a second victory; and took the camp of Darius, together with his family, whom he treated with the utmost humanity. Contrary to all the maxims of war, instead of pursuing Darius, he made an excursion into Egypt; and, as far as appears, through no better motives than those of vanity. Here he was acknowledged to be the son of Jupiter Ammon. In the mean time Darius recruited his strength, and got together an army superior to what he brought into the plain of Issus.\n\nAlexander having finished his Egyptian expedition, traversed Asia, and passed the Euphrates. At Arbela, a town in Assyria, he met Darius. Here a decisive battle was fought, which put all Persia into the hands of Alexander. His ambition not being satisfied with the conquest of that vast country, he projected an expedition into India. Here he met with great opposition from Porus, a gallant prince, whom in the end he reduced. Beyond the Ganges lay a country still unsubdued. He notified it to his army, that he proposed to pass the river. But these veterans, harassed with their fatigues, and seeing no end of their labour, mutinied, and refused to march further. The disappointed chief was therefore obliged to return. At Babylon he proposed to receive ambassadors, appoint governors, and settle his vast monarchy; but his excesses put an end to his life in the midst of his designs, and in the flower of his age.\n\nThe character of this hero is so familiar to every body, that it is almost needless labour to draw it. All the world knows, says Mr Bayle, that it was equally composed of very great virtues and very great vices. He had no mediocrity in any thing but his stature; in other properties, whether good or bad, he was all extremes. His ambition rose even to madness. His father was not at all mistaken in supposing the bounds of Macedon too small for his son: for how could Macedon bound the ambition of a man, who reckoned the whole world too small a dominion? He wept at hearing the philosopher Anaxarchus say, that there was an infinite number of worlds: his tears were owing to his despair of conquering them all, since he had not yet been able to conquer one. Livy, in a short digression, has attempted to inquire into the events which might have happened, if Alexander, after the conquest of Asia, had brought his arms into Italy? Doubtless things might have taken a very different turn with him; and all the grand projects, which succeeded so well against an effeminate Persian monarch, might easily have miscarried if he had had to do with rough hardy Roman armies. And yet the vast aims of this mighty conqueror, if seen under another point of view, may appear to have been confined in a very narrow compass; since, as we are told, the utmost wish of that great heart, for which the whole earth was not big enough, was, after all, to be praised by the Athenians: for it is related, that the difficulties which he encountered in order to pass the Hydaspes, forced him to cry out, \"O Athenians, could you believe to what dangers I expose myself for the sake of being celebrated by you?\" But Bayle affirms, that this was quite consistent with the vast unbounded extent of his ambition, as he wanted to make all future time his own, and be an object of admiration to the latest posterity; yet did not expect this from the conquest of worlds, but from books. He was perfectly in the right, says Bayle; \"for if Greece had not furnished him with good writers, he would long ago have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in Macedon before Amphitryon.\"\n\nAlexander has been praised upon the score of continency, yet his life could not surely be quite regular in that respect. Indeed, the fire of his early youth appeared so cold towards women, that his mother suspected\nAlexander pected him to be impotent; and, to satisfy herself in this point, did, with the consent of Philip, procure a very handsome courtezan to lie with him, whose caresses, however, were all to no purpose. His behaviour afterwards to the Persian captive shows him to have had a great command over himself in this particular. The wife of Darius was a finished beauty; her daughters likewise were all beauties; yet this young prince, who had them in his power, not only bestowed on them all the honours due to their high rank, but managed their reputation with the utmost delicacy. They were kept as in a cloister concealed from the world, and secured from the reach of every dishonourable (not only attack, but) imputation. He did not give the least handle to scandal, either by his visits, his looks, or his words: and for other Persian dames his prisoners, equally beautiful in face and shape, he contented himself with saying gayly, that they gave indeed much pain to his eyes. The Amazon Thalestris could not obtain from him a compliance with her gallant request till after a delay of thirteen days. In the mean time, what are we to conclude from his causing his favourite mistress Pancaste to be drawn naked by Apelles, though it is true he gave her to the painter, who fell in love with her? What of that immoderate love of boys, which Athenaeus relates of him? What of that prodigious number of wives and concubines which he kept?\n\nHis excesses with regard to wine were notorious, and beyond all imagination; and he committed, when drunk, a thousand extravagances. It was owing to wine, that he killed Clitus who saved his life, and burnt Persepolis, one of the most beautiful cities of the East: he did this last indeed at the instigation of the courtezan Thais; but this circumstance made it only the more heinous. It is generally believed, that he died by drinking immoderately: and even Plutarch, who affects to contradict it, owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill.\n\nIn short, to sum up the character of this prince, we cannot be of opinion, that his good qualities did in anywise compensate for his bad ones. Heroes make a noise: their actions glare, and strike the senses forcibly; while the infinite destruction and misery they occasion lie more in the shade, and out of sight. One good legislator is worth all the heroes that ever did or will exist. See Macedon.\n\nAlexander ab Alexandro, a Neapolitan lawyer, of great learning, who flourished toward the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century. He followed the profession of the law first at Naples, afterwards at Rome: but he devoted all the time he could spare to the study of polite literature; and at length he entirely left the bar, that he might lead a more easy and agreeable life with the Muses. The particulars of his life are to be gathered from his work entitled \"Dies Geniales.\" We are there informed, that he lodged at Rome, in a house that was haunted; and he relates many surprising particulars about the ghost. He says also, that when he was very young, he went to the lectures of Philoephus, who explained at Rome the Tufculan questions of Cicero; he was there also when Nicholas Perot and Domitius Calderinus read their lectures upon Martial. The particular time when he died is not known; but he was buried in the monastery of the Olivets. Tiraequa wrote a learned commentary upon his work, which was printed at Lyons in Alexander 1587, and reprinted at Leyden, in 1673, with the notes of Dennis Godfrey, Christopher Colerus, and Nicholas Mercerus.\n\nAlexander, Neckham, an eminent English writer in the 12th and 13th centuries, born at St Albans in Hertfordshire. In 1215 he was made abbot of Exeter, and died in 1227. He wrote several works, which were never published; but they are to be found in manuscript in the libraries of England and other countries.\n\nAlexander, Noel, an indefatigable writer of the 17th century, born at Rouen in Normandy, 1639. After finishing his studies at Rouen, he entered into the order of Dominican friars, and was professed there in 1655. Soon after he went to Paris, to go through a course of philosophy and divinity in the great convent, where he distinguished himself so, that he was appointed to teach philosophy there, which he did for 12 years. M. Colbert showed him many marks of his esteem; and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his son, afterwards archbishop of Rouen, he formed an assembly of the most learned persons, whose conferences upon ecclesiastical history might be of advantage to him. Father Alexander was invited to this assembly, where he exerted himself with so much genius and ability, that he gained the particular friendship of young Colbert, who showed him the utmost regard as long as he lived. These conferences gave rise to Alexander's design of writing an ecclesiastical history; for, being desired to reduce what was material in these conferences to writing, he did it with so much accuracy, that the learned men who composed this assembly, advised him to undertake a complete body of church history. This he executed with great assiduity, collecting and digesting the materials himself, and writing even the tables with his own hand. He at last completed his work in 1686. Towards the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with the loss of his sight; a most inexplicable misfortune to one whose whole pleasure was in study, yet he bore it with great patience and resignation. He died merely of a decay of nature, 1724, in the 86th year of his age.\n\nAlexander Severus, emperor of Rome, succeeded Heliogabalus about A.D. 222, when but 16 years of age. His mother's name was Mammæa, and by her advice he in a great measure regulated his conduct. He applied himself to the reformation of abuses, the state having been greatly disordered by the vicious conduct of his predecessor; he was a most strict lover of justice, an encourager of learning and learned men, and favourable to the Christians. He made a successful expedition against the Persians; but endeavouring to reform his troops, who had grown very licentious under the late bad government, they murdered him at the instigation of Maximinus, in the 29th year of his age, together with his mother, A.D. 235.\n\nAlexander VI. Pope, had four bastard children when he was cardinal, for one of which he had so great affection, that he stuck at nothing to raise him. Designing to poison some cardinals, he was poisoned himself, A.D. 1503. See Borgia.\n\nAlexander VII. Pope. See Chigi.\n\nAlexander bishop of Lincoln in the reigns of Henry I. and Stephen, was a Norman by birth, and nephew\nAlexander, phew of the famous Roger, bishop of Salisbury, who first made him archdeacon of Salisbury, and afterwards, by his interest with the king, raised him to the mitre. Alexander was consecrated at Canterbury, July 22, 1123. Having received his education under his uncle the bishop of Salisbury, and been accustomed to a splendid way of living, he affected how and state more than was suitable to his character, or consistent with his fortunes. This failing excepted, he was a man of worth and honour, and every way qualified for his station. The year after his consecration, his cathedral church at Lincoln having been accidentally burnt down, he rebuilt it, and secured it against the like accident for the future by a stone roof. This prelate increased the number of prebends in his church, and augmented its revenues with several manors and estates. In imitation of the barons and some of the bishops, particularly his uncle the bishop of Salisbury, he built three castles; one at Banbury, another at Sleaford, and a third at Newark. He likewise founded two monasteries; one at Haverholme, for regular canons and nuns together, the other at Tame for white friars. He went twice to Rome in the years 1142 and 1144. The first time, he came back in quality of the pope's legate, for the calling a synod, in which he published several wholesome and necessary canons. In August 1147, he took a third journey to the pope, who was then in France; where he fell sick through the excessive heat of the weather, and returning with great difficulty to England, where he died in the 24th year of his prelacy.\n\nAlexander, William, earl of Stirling, an eminent Scots statesman and poet in the reigns of James VI. and Charles I., who, after travelling with the duke of Argyle as his tutor or companion, wrote a poetical complaint of his unsuccessful love of some beauty, under the title of Aurora. He then removed to the court of James VI., where he applied to the more solid parts of poetry, forming himself upon the plan of the Greek and Roman tragedians. In 1607, he published some dramatic performances, entitled The Monarchic Tragedies, dedicated to King James; who so well pleased with them, as to call him his philosophical poet. After this, he is said to have written A Supplement to complete the third part of Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia; and in 1613, he produced a poem called Doomday, or the Great Day of Judgment. He was made gentleman usher to Prince Charles, and master of the requests; was knighted; and obtained a grant of Nova Scotia, where he projected the settlement of a colony, but afterwards sold it to the French. In 1626, he was made secretary of state for Scotland; was created first viscount, and then earl, of Stirling; and died in 1640.\n\nAlexander I., St., whom St. Irenaeus reckons the fifth bishop of Rome, succeeded St. Evaristus in the year 109, and died in the year 119. There is no account of his life; and the epistles which are attributed to him are spurious.\n\nAlexander II., king of Scotland, succeeded his father William in 1213, at 16 years of age. He made an expedition into England, to oppose the tyranny of King John; who returned the visit, and was offered battle by Alexander, but refused it. He took the city of Carlisle from Henry III., which was afterwards exchanged for Berwick. Alexander died in 1249, in the 31st year of his age, and 35th of his reign; and left for his successor, his son—\n\nAlexander III., who was crowned king of Scotland in 1249. The Cummings, a powerful family, took arms against him; and taking him prisoner, confined him at Stirling; but he was afterwards released by his subjects. He married the daughter of Henry III., king of England; and was at length killed by a fall from his horse, on the 10th of April 1290, after having reigned 42, or according to others 37, years.\n\nAlexanders, in Botany. See Smyrnium.\n\nAlexandretta, by the Turks called Scanderoon; a town in Syria, at the extremity of the Mediterranean sea. It is the port of Aleppo, from which it is distant 28 or 30 leagues. It is now, properly speaking, nothing else but a village, without walls, in which the tombs are more numerous than the houses, and which entirely owes its existence to the road which it commands. This is the only road, in all Syria, where vessels anchor on a solid bottom, without their cables being liable to chafe; but in other respects it has many inconveniences. It is infested, during winter, by a peculiar wind, called by the French sailors le Raguier, which, rushing from the snowy summits of the mountains, frequently forces ships to drag their anchors several leagues: And when the snow begins to cover the mountains which surround the gulf, tempestuous winds arise which prevent vessels from entering for three or four months together. The road also to Aleppo by the plain is invested by Curd robbers, who conceal themselves in the neighbouring rocks, and frequently attack and plunder the foreign caravans. But the worst circumstance is the extreme unwholeness of the air, occasioned here by stagnant waters and mephitic exhalations. It may be affirmed that this every year carries off one-third of the crews of the vessels which remain here during the summer; nay, ships frequently lose all their men in two months. The season for this epidemic disorder is principally from May to the end of September: it is an intermitting fever of the most malignant kind; and is accompanied with obstructions of the liver, which terminate in dropsy. To this baneful epidemic, Alexandretta, from its situation, seems to be irremediably condemned: for the plain on which the town is built is so low and flat, that the rivulets, finding no declivity, can never reach the sea. When they are swelled by the winter rains, the sea, swelled likewise by tempests, hinders their discharging themselves into it: hence their waters, forced to spread themselves, form lakes in the plain. On the approach of the summer, the waters becoming corrupted by the heat, exhale vapours equally corrupt, and which cannot disperse, being confined by the mountains that encircle the gulf. The entrance of the bay besides lies to the west, which in those countries is the most unhealthy exposure when it corresponds with the sea. The labour necessary to remedy this would be immense, and after all insufficient; and, indeed, such an undertaking would be absolutely impossible under a government like that of the Turks. A few years ago, Mr Volney informs us, the merchants of Aleppo, disgusted with the numerous inconveniences of Alexandretta, wished to abandon that port and carry the trade\nto Latakia. They proposed to the pasha of Tripoli to repair the harbour at their own expense, provided he would grant them an exemption from all duties for ten years. To induce him to comply with their request, the agent they employed talked much of the advantage which would, in time, result to the whole country: \"But what signifies it to me what may happen in time,\" replied the pasha? I was yesterday at Marach; to-morrow, perhaps, I shall be at Djedda: Why should I deprive myself of present advantages, which are certain, for future benefits I cannot hope to partake?\" The European factors were obliged therefore to remain at Scanderoon. There are three of these factors, two for the French, and one for the English and Venetians. The only curiosity which they have to amuse strangers with consists in five or seven marble monuments, sent from England, on which you read: Here lies such a one, carried off in the flower of his age, by the fatal effects of a contagious air. The flight of these is the more distressing, as the languid air, yellow complexion, livid eyes, and drooping bellies of those who show them, make it too probable they cannot long escape the same fate. It is true, they have some resource in the village of Bailan, the pure air and excellent waters of which surprisingly restore the sick. The aga, for some years past, has applied the duties of the customhouse of Alexandretta to his own use, and rendered himself almost independent of the pasha of Aleppo. The Turkish empire is full of rich rebels, who frequently die in peaceable possession of their usurpations.\n\nALEXANDRIA, in Ancient Geography, a mountain of Myfia, on the sea coast, forming a part of Mount Ida, where Paris gave judgment on the three goddesses.\n\nALEXANDRIA, now Scandaria, by Athenaeus called Σκάνδαρις; a city of Lower Egypt, and for a long time its capital. This city was built by Alexander the Great, soon after the overthrow of Tyre, about 333 years before Christ. It is situated on the Mediterranean, twelve miles west of that mouth of the Nile anciently called Canopicum; and lies in E. Long. 30° 9' N. Lat. 31° 10'.\n\nAlexander is said to have been induced to build this city, on account of its being conveniently situated for a fine port; and so sudden was his resolution, that after he had directed where every public structure was to be placed, fixed the number of temples, and the deities to whom they should be dedicated, &c., there were no instruments at hand proper for marking out the walls, according to the custom of those times. Upon this, a workman advised the king to collect what meal was among the soldiers, and to fit it in lines upon the ground, whereby the circuit of the walls would be sufficiently marked out. This advice was followed; and the new method of marking out the walls was, by Aristaean, the king's footlayer, interpreted as a prefigure of the city's abounding with all the necessaries of life. Nor was he deceived in his prediction; for Alexandria soon became the staple, not only for merchandise, but also for all the arts and sciences of the Greeks.\n\nAlexandria was a league and a half long, by one-third in breadth, which made the circumference of its walls about four leagues. Lake Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north. It was intersected lengthwise by straight parallel streets. This direction left a free passage to the northerly wind, which alone conveys coolness and salubrity into Egypt. A street of 2000 feet wide began at the gate of the sea, and terminated at the gate of Canopus. It was decorated with magnificent houses, temples, and public buildings. In this extensive range, the eye was never tired with admiring the marble, the porphyry and the obelisks, which were destined at some future day to embellish Rome and Constantinople. This street, the handsomest in the universe, was intersected by another of the same breadth, which formed a square at their junction of half a league in circumference. From the middle of this great place, the two gates were to be seen at once, and vessels arriving under full sail from the north and from the south.\n\nA mole of a mile in length stretched from the continent to the island of Pharos, and divided the harbour into two. That which is to the northward preserved its name. A dike drawn from the island to the rock whereon was built the Pharos, secured it from the westerly winds. The other was called Eunofos, or the Safe Return. The former is called at present the new, the latter the old harbour: a bridge that joins the mole to the city, served for a communication between them. It was raised on lofty pillars sunk into the sea, and left a free passage for ships. The palace, which advanced beyond the promontory of Lochias, extended as far as the dike, and occupied more than a quarter of the city. Each of the Ptolemies added to its magnificence. It contained within its inclosure, the museum, an asylum for learned men, groves, and buildings worthy of royal majesty, and a temple where the body of Alexander was deposited in a golden coffin. The infamous Seleucus Cibyofactes violated this monument, carried off the golden coffin, and put a glass one in its place. In the great harbour was the little island of Anti-Rhodes, where stood a theatre, and a royal place of residence. Within the harbour of Eunofos was a smaller one, called Kiloitos, dug by the hand of man, which communicated with Lake Mareotis by a canal. Between this canal and the palace was the admirable temple of Serapis, and that of Neptune near the great place where the market was held. Alexandria extended likewise along the southern banks of the lake. Its eastern part presented to view the gymnasium, with its porticoes of more than 600 feet long, supported by several rows of marble pillars. Without the gate of Canopus was a spacious circus for the chariot races. Beyond that, the suburb of Nicopolis ran along the foreshore, and seemed a second Alexandria. A superb amphitheatre was built there with a race-ground, for the celebration of the quinquennalia.\n\nSuch is the description left us of Alexandria by the ancients, and above all by Strabo.\n\nThe architect employed by Alexander in this undertaking was the celebrated Dinocrates, who had acquired so much reputation by rebuilding the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The city was first rendered populous by Ptolemy Soter, one of Alexander's captains, who, after the death of the Macedonian monarch, being appointed governor of Egypt, soon assumed the title of king, and took up his residence at Alexandria, about 304 years before Christ.\nAlexandria. In the 35th year of Ptolemy Soter's reign, he took his son Ptolemy Philadelphus partner with him in the empire; and by this prince the city of Alexandria was much embellished. In the first year of his reign the famous watch-tower of Pharos was finished. It had been begun several years before by Ptolemy Soter; and, when finished, was looked upon as one of the wonders of the world. The same year, the island of Pharos itself, originally seven furlongs distant from the continent, was joined to it by a causeway. This was the work of Dexiphanes, who completed it at the same time that his son put the last hand to the tower. The tower was a large square structure of white marble; on the top of which fires were kept constantly burning, for the direction of sailors. The building cost 800 talents; which, if Attic, amounted to 165,000l.; if Alexandrian, to twice that sum.\n\nThe architect employed in this famous structure fell upon the following contrivance to usurp the whole glory to himself.—Being ordered to engrave upon it the following inscription, \"King PTOLEMY to the Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of Sailors;\" instead of the king's name he substituted his own, and then filling up the hollow of the marble with mortar, wrote upon it the above-mentioned inscription. In process of time, the mortar being worn off, the following inscription appeared: \"SOSTRATUS the Cnidian, the son of Dexiphanes, to the Gods the Saviours, for the benefit of Sailors.\"\n\nThis year also was remarkable for the bringing of the image of Serapis from Pontus to Alexandria. It was set up in one of the suburbs of the city called Rhacotis, where a temple was afterwards erected to his honour, suitable to the greatness of that stately metropolis, and called, from the god worshipped there, Serapeum. This structure, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, surpassed in beauty and magnificence all others in the world, except the capitol at Rome.\n\nWithin the verge of this temple was the famous Alexandrian library. It was founded by Ptolemy Soter, for the use of an academy instituted in this city; and, by continual additions by his successors, became at last the finest library in the world, containing no fewer than 700,000 volumes. The method followed in collecting books for this library, was to seize all those which were brought into Egypt by Greeks or other foreigners. The books were transcribed in the museum by persons appointed for that purpose; the copies were then delivered to the proprietors, and the originals laid up in the library. Ptolemy Euergetes, having borrowed from the Athenians the works of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus, returned them only the copies, which he caused to be transcribed in as beautiful a manner as possible; presenting the Athenians at the same time with fifteen talents (upwards of 3000l. sterling) for the exchange.\n\nAs the museum was at first in that quarter of the city called Bruchion, near the royal palace, the library was placed there likewise; but when it came to contain 400,000 volumes, another library, within the Serapeum, was erected by way of supplement to it, and on that account called the daughter of the former. In this second library 300,000 volumes, in process of time, were deposited; and the two together contained the 700,000 volumes already mentioned. In the war carried on by Julius Caesar against the inhabitants of this city, the library in the Bruchion, with the 400,000 volumes it contained, was reduced to ashes. The library in the Serapeum, however, still remained; and here Cleopatra deposited 200,000 volumes of the Pergamene library, which Marc Antony presented her with. These, and others added from time to time, rendered the new library at Alexandria more numerous and considerable than the former; and though it was often plundered during the revolutions and troubles of the Roman empire, yet it was again and again repaired, and filled with the same number of books.\n\nFor 293 years Alexandria was held in subjection by the Ptolemies. Here is a list of these princes, with the dates of their respective reigns.\n\nPtolemy the son of Lagus, surnamed Soter, reigned 39 years, and died in the year of the world 3720. Ptolemy Philadelphus reigned 39 years, and died in 3758. Ptolemy Euergetes reigned 25 years, and died in 3783. Ptolemy Philopater reigned 17 years, and died in 3850. Ptolemy Epiphanes reigned 24 years, and died in 3824. Ptolemy Philometor reigned 37 years, and died in 3861. Ptolemy Euergetes, or Philocon, reigned 53 years, part with his brother Philometor and part alone. He died in 3888. Ptolemy Lathyrus reigned 36 years six months. He died in 3923. Cleopatra, the daughter of Lathyrus and wife of Alexander I., reigned six months. Alexander I., the nephew of Lathyrus, was established in 3924, and died in 3943. Alexander II., the son of Alexander I., was dethroned by the Alexandrians in 3939. Ptolemy Nothus, or Auletes, the son of Lathyrus, reigned 13 years, and died in 3953. Ptolemy, surnamed Dionysius or Bacchus, reigned three years eight months, and died in 3957. Cleopatra reigned from 3957, and killed herself in 3974.\n\nThis city, as we have already observed, soon became extremely populous, and was embellished both by its own princes and the Romans; but, like most other noted cities of antiquity, hath been the seat of terrible massacres. About 141 years before Christ, it was almost totally depopulated by Ptolemy Phyfeon. That barbarous monster, without the least provocation, gave free liberty to his guards to plunder his metropolis and murder the inhabitants at their pleasure. The cruelties practised on this occasion cannot be expressed; and the few who escaped were so terrified that they fled into other countries. Upon this, Phyfeon, that he might not reign over empty houses, invited thither strangers from the neighbouring countries; by whom the city was repeopled, and soon recovered its former splendour. On this occasion many learned men having been obliged to fly, proved the means of reviving learning in Greece, Asia Minor, the islands of the Archipelago, and other places, where it was almost totally lost.\n\nThe new inhabitants were not treated with much more kindness by Phyfeon than the old ones had been; for, on their complaining of his tyrannical behaviour, he resolved on a general massacre of the young men. Accordingly, when they were one day assembled in the gymnastum, or place of their public exercises, he ordered it to be set on fire; so that they all perished.\nAlexandria, ed., either in the flames, or by the swords of his mercenaries, whom the tyrant had placed at all the avenues.\n\nThough Julius Caesar was obliged to carry on a war for some time against this city, it seems not to have suffered much damage, except the burning of the library already mentioned. Before Caesar left Alexandria, in acknowledgment of the affiance he had received from the Jews, he confirmed all their privileges there, and even engraved his decree on a pillar of brass. This, however, did not prevent the massacre of 50,000 of them in this city about the year of Christ 67.\n\nThe city of Alexandria seems to have fallen into decay soon after this, and to have forfeited many of its ancient privileges, though for what offence is not known; but when Adrian visited Egypt, about the year 141, it was almost totally ruined. He repaired both the public and private buildings, not only restoring the inhabitants to their ancient privileges, but heaping new favours upon them; for which they returned him their solemn thanks, and conferred upon him what honours they could while he was present; but as soon as he was gone, they published the most bitter and virulent lampoons against him.\n\nThe fickle and satirical humour of the Alexandrians was highly disliked by Adrian, though he inflicted no punishment upon them for it; but when they lampooned Caracalla, he did not let them escape so easily. That tyrant, in the year 215, when he visited their city, having become the subject of their foolish satires, ordered a general massacre by his numerous troops, who were dispersed all over the city. The inhuman orders being given, all were murdered, without distinction of age or sex; so that in one night's time the whole city floated in blood, and every house was filled with carcasses. The monster who occasioned this had retired during the night to the temple of Serapis, to implore the protection of that deity; and, not yet satisfied with slaughter, commanded the massacre to be continued all the next day; so that very few of the inhabitants remained. As if even this had not been sufficient, he stripped the city of all its ancient privileges; suppressed the academy; ordered all strangers who lived there to depart; and that the few who remained might not have the satisfaction of seeing one another, he cut off all communication of one street with another, by walls built for that purpose, and guarded by troops left there.\n\nNotwithstanding this terrible disaster, Alexandria soon recovered its former splendour, as Caracalla was murdered a short time after. It was long esteemed the first city in the world, next to Rome; and we may judge of its magnificence, and the multitude of people contained in it, from the account of Diodorus Siculus, who relates, that in his time (44 years before Christ) Alexandria had on its rolls 300,000 freemen. Towards the middle of the fifth century, Amrou Ebn al Aas, Omar's general, took it by storm, after a siege of 14 months, and with the loss of 23,000 men. Heraclius, then emperor of Constantinople, did not send a single ship to its assistance. This prince affords an example very rare in history; he had displayed some vigour in the first year of his reign, and then suffered himself to be lulled into idleness and effeminacy. Awakened suddenly from his lethargy by the noise of the conquests of Cosroes, that scourge of the east, he Alexandria put himself at the head of his armies, distinguished himself as a great captain from his very first campaign, laid waste Persia for seven years, and returned to his capital covered with laurels: he then became a theologian on the throne, lost all his energy, and amused himself the rest of his life with disputing upon Monotheism, whilst the Arabs were robbing him of the finest provinces of his empire. Deaf to the cries of the unfortunate inhabitants of Alexandria, as he had been to those of the people of Jerusalem, who defended themselves for two years, he left them a sacrifice to the fortunate ascendant of the indefatigable Amrou. All their intrepid youth perished with their arms in their hands.\n\nThe victor, astonished at his conquest, wrote to the caliph, \"I have taken the city of the west. It is of an immense extent. I cannot describe to you how many wonders it contains. There are 4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 12,000 dealers in fresh oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews who pay tribute, 400 theatres or places of amusement.\"\n\nAt this time, according to the Arabian historians, Alexandria consisted of three cities, viz. Menna, or the port, which included Pharos, and the neighbouring parts; Alexandria, properly so called, where the modern Scardina now stands; and Nebita, probably the Necropolis of Josephus and Strabo.\n\nAt that time John, surnamed the grammarian, a famous Peripatetic philosopher, being in the city, and in high favour with Amrou Ebn al Aas the Saracen general, begged of him the royal library. Amrou replied, that it was not in his power to grant such a request; but that he would write to the caliph on that head; since, without knowing his pleasure, he dared not to dispose of a single book. He accordingly wrote to Omar, who was then caliph, acquainting him with the request of his friend: To which the ignorant tyrant replied, That if those books contained the same doctrine with the Koran, they could be of no use, since the Koran contained all necessary truths; but if they contained any thing contrary to that book, they ought not to be suffered; and therefore, whatever their contents were, he ordered them to be destroyed. Pursuant to this order, they were distributed among the public baths; where, for the space of six months, they served to supply the fires of those places, of which there was an incredible number in Alexandria.\n\nAfter the city was taken, Amrou thought proper to pursue the Greeks who had fled farther up the country; and therefore marched out of Alexandria, leaving but a very slender garrison in the place. The Greeks, who had before fled on board their ships, being apprised of this, returned on a sudden, surprized the town, and put all the Arabs they found therein to the sword; but Amrou, receiving advice of what had happened, suddenly returned, and drove them out of it with great slaughter; after which the Greeks were so intimidated, that he had nothing farther to fear from them.—A few years after, however, Amrou being deprived of his government by the caliph Othman, the Egyptians were so much displeased with his dismission that they inclined to a revolt; and Constantine the Greek emperor, having received intelligence of their disaffection, began to meditate the reduction of Alexandria. For this purpose,\nAlexandria, he sent one Manuel, an eunuch, and his general, with a powerful army, to retake that place; which, by the affluence of the Greeks in the city, who kept a secret correspondence with the imperial forces while at sea, and joined them as soon as they had made a descent, he effected, without any considerable effusion of Christian blood. The caliph, now perceiving his mistake, immediately restored Amrou to his former dignity. This step was very agreeable to the natives; who having had experience of the military skill and bravery of this renowned general, and apprehending that they should be called to an account by the Greeks for their former perfidious conduct, had petitioned Othman to send him again into Egypt.—Upon Amrou's arrival, therefore, at Alexandria, the Copts or natives, with the traitor Al-Mokawwas (who had formerly betrayed to Amrou the fortresses of Mefr) at their head, not only joined him, but supplied him with all kinds of provisions, exciting him to attack the Greeks without delay. This he did; and, after a most obstinate dispute which lasted several days, drove them into the town, where, for some time, they defended themselves with great bravery, and repelled the utmost efforts of the besiegers. This so exasperated Amrou, that he swore, \"If God enabled him to conquer the Greeks, he would throw down the walls of the city, and make it as easy of access as the house of a prostitute.\" Nor did he fail to execute his threat; for having taken the town by storm, he quite dismantled it, entirely demolishing the walls and fortifications. The lives of the citizens, however, were spared, at least as far as lay in the general's power; but many of them were put to the sword by the soldiers on their first entrance. In one quarter particularly, Amrou found them butchering the Alexandrians with unrelenting barbarity; to which, however, by his clement intervention, he put a stop, and on that spot erected a mosque, which he called the mosque of mercy.\n\nFrom this time Alexandria never recovered its former splendour. It continued under the dominion of the caliphs till the year 924, when it was taken by the Magrebians, two years after its great church had been destroyed by fire. This church was called by the Arabs Al-Kafaria, or Cofarea; and had formerly been a pagan temple, erected in honour of Saturn by the famous queen Cleopatra.\n\nThe city was soon after abandoned by the Magrebians; but in 928 they again made themselves masters of it; their fleet being afterwards defeated by that belonging to the caliph, Abul Kafem the Magrebian general retired from Alexandria, leaving there only a garrison of 300 men; of which Thmaal, the caliph's admiral, being apprised, he in a few days appeared before the town, and carried off the remainder of the inhabitants to an island in the Nile called Abuqir. This was done to prevent Abul Kafem from meeting with any entertainment at Alexandria, in case he should think proper to return. According to Eutychius, above 200,000 of the miserable inhabitants perished this year.\n\nWhat contributed to raise Alexandria to such a prodigious height of splendour as it enjoyed for a long time, was its being the centre of commerce between the eastern and western parts of the world. It was with the view of becoming master of this lucrative trade, that Alexander built this city, after having extirpated the Tyrians who formerly engrossed all the East India traffic. Of the immense riches which that trade afforded, we may form an idea, from considering that the Romans accounted it a point of policy to oppress the Egyptians, especially the Alexandrians; and after the defeat of Zenobia, there was a single merchant of Alexandria who undertook to raise and pay an army out of the profits of his trade. The Greek emperors drew prodigious tributes from Egypt, and yet the caliphs found their subjects in so good circumstances as to screw up their revenues to three hundred millions of crowns.\n\nThough the revolutions which happened in the government of Egypt, after it fell into the hands of the Mahometans, frequently affected this city to a very great degree; yet still the excellence of its port, and the innumerable conveniences resulting from the East India trade, to whomsoever were masters of Egypt, preserved Alexandria from total destruction, even when in the hands of the most barbarous nations. Thus, in the 13th century, when the barbarism introduced by the Goths, &c., began to wear off from the European nations, and they acquired a taste for the elegancies of life, the old mart of Alexandria began to revive; and the port, though far from recovering its former magnificence, grew once more famous by becoming the centre of commerce: but having fallen under the dominion of the Turks, and the paillage round the Cape of Good Hope being discovered by the Portuguese in 1499, a fatal blow was given to the Alexandrian commerce, and the city has since fallen into decay.\n\nAt present, the city of Alexandria is reckoned to have about 14,000 or 15,000 inhabitants; a strange conglomeration of different nations, as well as from various parts of the Turkish empire. They are in general given to thieving and cheating; and (like their predecessors) fedulous above all others, were they not kept in awe by the severity of their government. The British and French carry on a considerable commerce with them, and have each a confidant residing here. Some Venetian ships also sail thither yearly, but with French colours, and under the protection of France. The subjects of those kingdoms which keep no confidant here, are subjected to a tax by the Grand Signior: but the Jews have found out a method of indemnifying themselves for this disadvantage; namely, by selling their commodities cheaper than other foreigners can afford. They are also favoured by the farmers of the revenue; who know, that if they do not pay some private regard to them, the Jews have it in their power to cause fewer merchandizes come into their port during the two years that their farm lasts.\n\nThe present city is a kind of peninsula situated between the two ports. That to the westward was called by the ancients the Portus Eumolpus, now the Old Port, and is by far the best; Turkish vessels only are allowed to anchor there: the other called the New Port, is for the Christians; at the extremity of one of the arms of which stood the famous Pharos. The New Port, the only harbour for Europeans, is clogged up with sand, infomuch that in stormy weather ships are liable to bilge; and the bottom being also rocky, the cables soon chafe and part; so that one vessel driving against a second, and that against a third, they are perhaps all lost. Of this there was a fatal instance some years ago, when 42 vessels were dashed to pieces on the mole.\nAlexandria, in a gale of wind from the north-west, and numbers have been since lost there at different times. If it be asked in Europe, Why do they not repair the New Port? the answer is, That in Turkey they destroy everything, and repair nothing. The old harbour will be destroyed likewise, as the ballast of vessels has been continually thrown into it for the last 200 years. The spirit of the Turkish government is to ruin the labours of past ages, and destroy the hopes of future times, because the barbarity of ignorant despotic never considers tomorrow.\n\nIn time of war, Alexandria is of no importance; no fortification is to be seen; even the Farillon, with its lofty towers, cannot be defended. It has not four cannon fit for service, nor a gunner who knows how to point them. The 500 janizaries, who should form the garrison, reduced to half that number, know nothing but how to smoke a pipe. But Alexandria is a place of which the conquest would be of no value. A foreign power could not maintain itself there, as the country is without water. This must be brought from the Nile by the kalidj, or canal of 12 leagues, which conveys it thither every year at the time of the inundation. It fills the vaults or reservoirs dug under the ancient city, and this provision must serve till the next year. It is evident, therefore, that were a foreign power to take possession, the canal would be shut, and all supplies of water cut off. It is this canal alone which connects Alexandria with Egypt; for from its situation without the Delta, and the nature of the soil, it really belongs to the deserts of Africa. Its environs are sandy, flat, and sterile, without trees and without houses; where we meet with nothing but the plant which yields the kali, and a row of palm trees which follows the course of the kalidj or canal.\n\nThe city is governed like others in the same kingdom. (See Egypt.) It hath a small garrison of soldiers, part of which are Janizaries and Affairs; who are very haughty and insolent, not only to strangers, but to the mercantile and industrious part of the people, though ever so considerable and useful. The government is so remiss in favour of these wretches, that Mr Norden informs us, one of them did not hesitate to kill a farmer of the customs, for refusing to take leave of him than the duty imposed, and went off unpunished; it being a common salvo among them, that what is done cannot be undone.\n\nThe present condition of Alexandria is very despicable, being now so far ruined, that the rubbish in many places overtops the houses. The famous tower of Pharos has long since been demolished, and a castle, called Farillon, built in its place. The causeway which joined the island to the continent is broken down, and its place supplied by a stone bridge of several arches.\n\nSome parts of the old walls of the city are yet standing, and present us with a masterpiece of ancient masonry. They are flanked with large towers, about 200 paces distant from each other, with smaller ones in the middle. Below are magnificent cafemates, which may serve for galleries to walk in. In the lower part of the towers is a large square hall, whose roof is supported by thick columns of Thebaic stone. Above this are several rooms, over which there are platforms more than 20 paces square. The ancient reservoirs, vaulted with so much art, which extend under the whole town, Alexandria are almost entire at the end of 2000 years.\n\nOf Caesar's palace there remain only a few porphyry pillars, and the front, which is almost entire, and looks very beautiful. The palace of Cleopatra was built upon the walls facing the port, having a gallery on the outside, supported by several fine columns. Not far from this palace are two obelisks vulgarly called Cleopatra's Needles. They are of Thebaic stone, and covered with hieroglyphics. One is overturned, broken, and lying under the sand; the other is on its pedestal. These two obelisks, each of them of a single stone, are about 60 feet high, by seven feet square at the base. Denon, who went to Egypt along with the French army in 1798, supposes that these columns decorated the entrance of the palace of the Ptolemies, the ruins of which still exist at no great distance from the place of the obelisks. Towards the gate of Rosetta, are five columns of marble on the place formerly occupied by the porticoes of the gymnasium. The rest of the colonnade, the design of which was discoverable 100 years ago by Mallett, has since been destroyed by the barbarism of the Turks.\n\nBut what most engages the attention of travellers is the pillar of Pompey, as it is commonly called, situated at a quarter of a league from the southern gate. It is composed of red granite. The capital is Corinthian, with palm leaves, and not indented. It is nine feet high. The shaft and the upper member of the base are of one piece of 90 feet long, and 9 in diameter. The base is a square of about 15 feet on each side. This block of marble, 60 feet in circumference, rests on two layers of stone bound together with lead; which, however, has not prevented the Arabs from forcing out several of them, to search for an imaginary treasure. The whole column is 114 feet high. It is perfectly well polished, and only a little chipped on the eastern side. Nothing can equal the majesty of this monument; seen from a distance, it overtops the town, and serves as a signal for vessels. Approaching it nearer, it produces an astonishment mixed with awe. One can never be tired with admiring the beauty of the capital, the length of the shaft, nor the extraordinary simplicity of the pedestal. This last has been somewhat damaged by the instruments of travellers, who are curious to possess a relic of this antiquity; and one of the volutes of the column was immaturely brought down about twelve years ago, by a prank of some English captains, which is thus related by Mr Irwin.\n\nThese jolly sons of Neptune had been pushing about the cannon board one of the ships in the harbour, until a strange freak entered into one of their brains. The eccentricity of the thought occasioned it immediately to be adopted; and its apparent impossibility was but a spur for the putting it into execution. The boat Voyage and was ordered; and with proper implements for the attempt, these enterprising heroes pushed ashore, to drink a bowl of punch on the top of Pompey's pillar! At the spot they arrived; and many contrivances were proposed to accomplish the desired point. But their labour was vain; and they began to despair of success, when the genius who struck out the frolic happily suggested the means of performing it. A man was dispatched\nAlexandria-patched to the city for a paper kite. The inhabitants were by this time apprized of what was going forward, and flocked in crowds to be witnesses of the address and boldness of the English. The governor of Alexandria was told that these seamen were about to pull down Pompey's pillar. But whether he gave them credit for their respect to the Roman warrior, or to the Turkish government, he left them to themselves; and politely answered, that the English were too great patriots to injure the remains of Pompey. He knew little, however, of the disposition of the people who were engaged in this undertaking. Had the Turkish empire risen in opposition, it would not perhaps at that moment have deterred them. The kite was brought, and flown so directly over the pillar, that when it fell on the other side, the string lodged upon the capital. The chief obstacle was now overcome. A two-inch rope was tied to one end of the string, and drawn over the pillar by the end to which the kite was affixed. By this rope one of the seamen ascended to the top; and in less than an hour a kind of shroud was constructed, by which the whole company went up, and drank their punch amid the shouts of the astonished multitude. To the eye below, the capital of the pillar does not appear capable of holding more than one man upon it; but our seamen found it could contain no less than eight persons very conveniently. It is astonishing that no accident befell these madcaps, in a situation so elevated, that would have turned a landsman giddy in his sober senses. The only detriment which the pillar received, was the loss of the volute before mentioned; which came down with a thundering sound, and was carried to England by one of the captains, as a present to a lady who commissioned him for a piece of the pillar. The discovery which they made amply compensated for this mischief; as without their evidence, the world would not have known at this hour, that there was originally a statue on this pillar, one foot and ankle of which are still remaining. The statue must have been of a gigantic size; to have appeared of a man's proportion at so great an height.\n\nThere are circumstances in this story which might give it an air of fiction, were it not demonstrated beyond all doubt. Besides the testimonies of many eyewitnesses, the adventurers themselves have left us a token of the fact, by the initials of their names, which are very legible in black paint just beneath the capital.\n\nLearned men and travellers have made many fruitless attempts to discover in honour of what prince it was erected. The best informed have concluded, that it could not be in honour of Pompey, since neither Strabo nor Diodorus Siculus have spoken of it. The Arabian Abulfeda, in his Description of Egypt, calls it the Pillar of Severus. And history informs us*, that this emperor visited the city of Alexandria: That he granted a senate to its inhabitants, who until that time, under the subjection of a single Roman magistrate, had lived without any national council, as under the reign of the Ptolemies, when the will of the prince was their only law: That he did not confine his benefactions there; he changed several laws in their favour.* This column, therefore, Mr Savary concludes to have been erected by the inhabitants as a mark of their gratitude to Severus. And in a Greek inscription, now half effaced, but visible on the west side when the sun shines upon it, and which probably was legible Alexandria, in the time of Abulfeda, he supposes the name of Severus to have been preserved. He further observes, that this was not the only monument erected to him by the gratitude of the Alexandrians: for there is still seen in the midst of the ruins of Antinoe, built by Adrian, a magnificent pillar, the inscription on which is still remaining, dedicated to Alexander Severus.\n\nDenon whom we have already quoted, seems to be of a different opinion. \"We passed (says he) near Pompey's pillar. This monument is in the predicament of almost everything famous, which loses on a near scrutiny. It was named Pompey's pillar in the fifteenth century, when learning began to recover itself from the torpid state in which it had so long languished. At that epoch, men of science, but not observers, bestowed names on all the monuments; and these names have been handed down by tradition, and without being disputed, from century to century. A monument had been raised to Pompey at Alexandria: it had disappeared, and was thought to be recovered in this pillar or column, which has since been converted into a trophy erected to the memory of Septimius Severus. It is, however, placed on the ruins of the ancient city; and in the time of Septimius Severus, the city of the Ptolemies was not in a ruinous state. To support this column by a solid foundation, an obelisk has been sunk in the earth, on which is placed a very clumsy pedestal, having a fine shaft, and surmounted by a Corinthian capital of bad workmanship.\n\n\"If the shaft of this column, separating it from the pedestal and the capital, once belonged to an ancient edifice, it is an evidence of its magnificence, and of the skill with which it was executed. It ought therefore to be said, that what is called Pompey's pillar, is a fine column, and not a fine monument. It should be said, that the column of St Maria Maggiore, notwithstanding it is one of the finest in existence, has not the character of a monument; that it is merely a fragment; and that, if the columns of Trajan and Antoninus are not in the same predicament, it is because they appear as colossal cylinders, on which the history of the glorious expeditions of these two emperors is pompously displayed, and which, if reduced to their simple form and dimensions, would be nothing more than dull and heavy monuments.\n\n\"The earth about the foundations of Pompey's pillar having been cleared away by time, two fragments of an obelisk of white marble, the only monument of that substance which I have seen in Egypt, have been added to the original base, to render it more solid.\n\n\"Excavations made round the circumference of this column, would, no doubt, afford some information relative to its origin. The shaking of the earth, and the form it takes on treading on it, seem to attest that these researches would not be fruitless. They would perhaps discover the base and atrium of the portico to which this column belonged, which has been the subject of dissertations made by literati who have seen the drawings only, or whose information has been limited to the descriptions of travellers. These travellers have neglected to apprise them, that fragments of columns of the same substance and diameter are found in the vicinity; and that the shaking of the earth indicates the destruction of great edifices buried beneath, the forms of\nALE\n\nAlexandria which may be distinguished on the surface, such as a square of a considerable size, and a large circus, the principal dimensions of which may be measured, notwithstanding it is covered with sand and ruins.\n\n\"After having observed that the column, entitled Pompey's pillar, is very chaste both in style and execution; that the pedestal and capital are not formed of the same granite as the shaft; that their workmanship is heavy, and appears to be merely a rough draught; and that the foundations, made up of fragments, indicate a modern construction; it may be concluded, that this monument is not antique, and that it may have been erected either in the time of the Greek emperors, or of the caliphs; since, if the capital and pedestal are well enough wrought to belong to the former of these periods, they are not so perfect but that art may have reached so far in the latter.\" (Denon's Travels.)\n\nOn the south-west side of the city, at a mile's distance, are situated the catacombs, the ancient burial-place of Alexandria; and although they cannot be compared to those of the ancient Memphis, which the Arabs will not permit to be visited, in order to make the better market of their mummies, it is probable that, the method of embalming being the same, the form of these catacombs can only differ in their proportions. The Baron de Tott, in describing these, observes, \"that Nature not having furnished this part of Egypt with a ridge of rocks, like that which runs parallel with the Nile above Delta, the ancient inhabitants of Alexandria could only have an imitation by digging into a bed of solid rock; and thus they formed Necropolis, or \"City of the Dead.\" The excavation is from 30 to 40 feet wide, and 200 long, and 25 deep, and is terminated by gentle declivities at each end. The sides, cut perpendicularly, contain several openings, about 10 or 12 feet in width and height, hollowed horizontally; and which form, by their different branches, subterranean streets. One of these, which curiosity has disencumbered from the ruins and sands that render the entrance of others difficult or impossible, contains no mummies, but only the places they occupied. The order in which they were ranged is still to be seen. Niches, 20 inches square, sunk six feet horizontally, narrowed at the bottom, and separated from each other by partitions in the rock, seven or eight inches thick, divide into checkers the two walls of this subterranean vault. It is natural to suppose, from this disposition that each mummy was introduced with the feet foremost into the cell intended for its reception; and that new streets were opened, in proportion as these dead inhabitants of Necropolis increased.\" This observation, he adds, which throws a light on the catacombs of Memphis, may perhaps likewise explain the vast size and multitude, as well as the different elevations, of the pyramids in the Higher and Lower Egypt.\n\nAbout 70 paces from Pompey's pillar is the khalis or the canal of the Nile, which was dug by the ancient Egyptians, to convey the water of the Nile to Alexandria, and fill the cisterns under the city. On the side of the khalis are gardens full of orange and lemon trees, and the fields are full of caper and palm trees. On the top of a hill is a tower, on which a sentinel is always placed, to give notice, by means of a flag, of the ships that are coming into the port. From this hill may be seen the sea, the whole extent Alexandria of the city, and the parts round it.\n\nIn going along the sea-coast, there is a large basin cut out of the rock that lines the shore. On the sides of this basin, two beautiful palaces are hewn out by the chisel, with benches that run across them. A canal made zig-zag, for the purpose of stopping the sand by its different windings, conveys into them the water of the sea, as pure and transparent as crystal. Seated on the stone-bench, the water rises a little above the waist; while the feet softly repose on a fine sand. The waves of the sea are heard roaring against the rock, and foaming in the canal. The swell enters, raises you up, and leaves you; and thus alternately entering and retiring, brings a continual fresh supply of water, and a coolness which is truly delicious under a burning sky. This place is vulgarly called the Bath of Cleopatra. Some ruins announce that it was formerly ornamented.\n\nIn 1798 Alexandria was taken by the French under the command of Bonaparte. It fell into the hands of the British army in the year 1801, but by an article in the treaty of peace, dictated probably by mutual jealousy, it is to be restored to the Ottoman Porte, and again subjected to the barbarous policy of the Turkish government.\n\nAlexandria is about 50 leagues north of Cairo. E. Long. 31. 15. N. Lat. 31. 12.\n\nAlexandria, a strong and considerable city of Italy, belonging to the duchy of Milan, with a good castle, built in 1178 in honour of Pope Alexander III. This pope made it a bishopric, with several privileges and exemptions. Prince Eugene of Savoy took this city in 1706, after three days siege. The French took it in 1745; but the king of Sardinia, to whom it belongs by the treaty of Utrecht, retook it in 1746. The fortifications of the town are trifling, but the citadel is considerable.

The country about this town is called the Alexandrin.\n\nAlexandria, in Ancient Geography, a city of Arabia, called also Alexandropolis, on the river Arachotus (Stephanus, Iridorus Characenus).—Another Alexandria in Gedrosia, built by Leonatus, by order of Alexander (Pliny).—A third Alexandria in Arija, situated at the lake Arias (Ptolemy); but, according to Pliny, built by Alexander on the river Arius.—A fourth in Bactriana (Pliny).—A fifth Alexandria, an inland town of Carmania (Pliny, Ptolemy, Ammianus).—A sixth Alexandria, or Alexandropolis, in Sogdiana (Iridorus Characenus).—A seventh in India, at the confluence of the Acesines and Indus (Arrian).—An eighth, called also Alexandretta, near the Sinus Ilicius, on the confines of Syria and Cilicia, now Scanderoon (see Alexandrett.).—The port town to Aleppo.—A ninth Alexandria of Margiana, which being demolished by the barbarians, was rebuilt by Antiochus the son of Seleucus, and called Antiochia of Syria (Pliny); watered by the river Margus, which is divided into several channels, for the purpose of watering the country which was called Zota. The city was seventy stadia in circuit, according to Pliny; who adds, that, after the defeat of Craesus, the captives were conveyed to this place by Orodes, the king of the\nALEXIPHARMICS, in Medicine, are properly remedies for expelling or preventing the ill effects of poison: but some of the moderns having imagined that the animal spirits in acute distempers were affected by a malignant poison, the term has been understood to mean medicines adapted to expel this poison by the cutaneous pores, in the form of sweat. In this sense, alexipharmics are the same as sudorifics.\n\nALEXIS, a Piedmontese. There is a book of \"Secrets,\" which for a long time has gone under his name. It was printed at Basil 1536, in 8vo, and translated from Italian into Latin by Wechier; it has also been translated into French, and printed several times with additions. There is a preface to the piece, wherein Alexis informs us, that he was born of a noble family; that he had from his most early years applied himself to study; that he had learned the Greek, the Latin, the Hebrew, the Chaldean, the Arabian, and several other languages; that having an extreme curiosity to be acquainted with the secrets of nature, he had collected as much as he could during his travels for 57 years; that he piqued himself upon not communicating his secrets to any person; but that when he was 82 years of age, having seen a poor man who had died of a sickness which might have been cured had he communicated his secret to the surgeon who took care of him, he was touched with such a remorse of conscience, that he lived almost like a hermit: and it was in this solitude that he arranged his secrets in such order as to make them fit to be published. The hawkers generally carry them, with other books, to the country fairs. These, however, contain only the select remedies of Seignior Alexis of Piedmont; the entire collection would make too large a volume for them.\n\nALEXITERIAL, among Physicians, a term of much the same import with alexipharmic; though sometimes used in a synonymous sense with amulet.\n\nALEYN, CHARLES, an English poet in the reign of Charles I.

The next piece he wrote was a poem in honour of Henry VII. and the victory that gained him the crown of England. In 1639, the year before he died, he translated the history of Eurialus and Lucretia, from the Latin epistles of Æneas Sylvius.\n\nALFANDIGA, the name of the customhouse at Lisbon.\n\nALFAQUES, among the Moors, the name generally used for their clergy, or those who teach the Mahometan religion; in opposition to the Morabites, who answer to monks among Christians.\n\nALFATERNA, in Ancient Geography, the last town of Campania, beyond Vesuvius (Diodorus); the fame with NOGERA, which see.

A salt spring was discovered here in 1679, from the pigeons which flew thither in great numbers to drink the water; those birds being known to be fond of salt. It contains a strong purging salt, together with a portion of sea-salt. It is recommended as cooling, cleansing, and attenuating, as a good remedy in the fever, jaundice, and other glandular obstructions. It also promotes urine and sweat, and therefore is good in gravelly and other disorders of the kidneys and bladder. Alford is six miles from the sea, and 20 north of Boston. E. Long. 0. 15. N. Lat. 53. 30.\n\nALFRED, or ÆLFRED, the Great, king of England, was the fifth and youngest son of Æthelwolf king of the West Saxons, and was born at Wantage in Berkshire in 849. He distinguished himself during the reign of his brother Ethelred, in several engagements against the Danes; and upon his death succeeded to the crown, in the year 871, and the 22d of his age. At his ascending the throne, he found himself involved in a dangerous war with the Danes, and placed in such circumstances of distress as called for the greatest valour, resolution, and all the other virtues with which he was adorned. The Danes had already penetrated into the heart of his kingdom; and before he had been a month upon the throne, he was obliged to take the field against those formidable enemies. After many battles gained on both sides, he was at length reduced to the greatest distress, and was entirely abandoned by his subjects. In this situation, Alfred, conceiving himself no longer a king, laid aside all marks of royalty, and took shelter in the house of one who kept his cattle. He retired afterwards to the isle of Æthelingey in Somersetshire, where he built a fort for the security of himself, his family, and the few faithful servants who repaired thither to him. When he had been about a year in this retreat, having been informed that some of his subjects had routed a great army of the Danes, killed their chiefs, and taken their magical standard (a), he issued his letters, giving notice where he was, and inviting his nobility to come and consult with him. Before they came to a final determination, Alfred, putting on the habit of a harp-\n\n(a) \"This (says Sir John Spelman) was a banner, with the image of a raven magically wrought by the three sisters of Hingwar and Hubba, on purpose for their expedition, in revenge of their father Lodebroch's murder, made, they say, almost in an instant, being by them at once begun and finished in a moment, and believed by the Danes to have carried great fatality with it, for which it was highly esteemed by them. It is pretended, that, being carried in battle, towards good success it would always seem to clap its wings, and make as if it would fly; but towards the approach of misfortune, it would hang down and not move.\" (Life of Alfred, p. 61.)\n\n(b) The Danes had possessed themselves of London in the time of his father; and had held it till now as a convenient place for them to land at, and fortify themselves in; neither was it taken from them but by a close siege. However, when it came into the king's hands, it was in a miserable condition, scarce habitable, and all its fortifications ruined. The king, moved by the importance of the place, and the desire of strengthening his frontier against the Danes, restored it to its ancient splendour. And observing, that through the confusion of the times, many, both Saxons and Danes, lived in a loose disorderly manner, without owning any government, he offered them now a comfortable establishment, if they would submit and become his subjects. This proposition was better received than he expected; for multitudes growing weary of a vagabond kind of life, joyfully accepted such an offer. (Chron. Sax. p. 88.)\nenemy, he obliged the Danes, settled in Northumberland and Essex, to give him hostages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and pitched his camp between their armies, to prevent their junction. A great body, however, moved off to Essex; and crossing the river, came to Farnham in Surrey, where they were defeated by the king's forces. Meanwhile the Danes settled in Northumberland, in breach of treaty, and notwithstanding the hostages given, equipped two fleets; and, after plundering the northern and southern coasts, failed to Exeter, and besieged it. The king, as soon as he received intelligence, marched against them; but before he reached Exeter, they had got possession of it. He kept them, however, blocked up on all sides; and reduced them at last to such extremities, that they were obliged to eat their horses, and were even ready to devour each other. Being at length rendered desperate, they made a general fall on the besiegers; but were defeated, though with great loss on the king's side. The remainder of this body of Danes fled into Essex, to the fort they had built there, and to their ships. Before Alfred had time to recruit himself, another Danish leader, whose name was Lof, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and destroyed all before him, marching on to the city of Werheal in the west, which is supposed to be Chester, where they remained the rest of that year. The year following they invaded North-Wales; and after having plundered and destroyed everything, they divided, one body returning to Northumberland, another into the territories of the East-Angles; from whence they proceeded to Essex, and took possession of a small island called Meresig. Here they did not long remain; for having separated, some sailed up the river Thames, and others up the Lea-road; where drawing up their ships, they built a fort not far from London, which proved a great check upon the citizens, who went in a body and attacked it, but were repulsed with great loss: at harvest time the king himself was obliged to encamp with a body of troops in the neighbourhood of the city, in order to cover the reapers from the excursions of the Danes. As he was one day riding by the side of the river Lea, after some observations he began to think that the Danish ships might be laid quite dry: this he attempted, and succeeded; so that the Danes deserted their fort and ships, and marched away to the banks of the Severn, where they built a fort, and wintered at a place called Quatbrig (c). Such of the Danish ships as could be got off, the Londoners carried into their own road; the rest they burnt and destroyed.\n\nAlfred enjoyed a profound peace during the three last years of his reign, which he chiefly employed in establishing and regulating his government, for the security of himself and his successors, as well as the ease and benefit of his subjects in general. After a troublesome reign of 28 years, he died on the 28th of October A.D. 900; and was buried at Winchester, in Hyde Abbey, under a monument of porphyry.\n\nAll our historians agree in distinguishing him as one of the most valiant, wisest, and best of kings that ever reigned in England; and it is also generally allowed, that he not only digested several particular laws still in being, but that he laid the first foundation of our present happy constitution. There is great reason to believe that we are indebted to this prince for trials by juries; and the Doomsday book, which is preserved in the exchequer, is thought to be no more than another edition of Alfred's book of Winchester, which contained a survey of the kingdom. It is said also, that he was the first who divided the kingdom into shires. What is ascribed to him is not a bare division of the country, but the settling a new form of judicature; for after having divided his dominions into shires, he subdivided each shire into three parts, called tythings. There are some remains of this ancient division in the ridings of Yorkshire, the laths of Kent, and the three parts of Lincolnshire. Each tything was divided into hundreds or wapentakes; and these again into tythings or dwellings of ten householders: each of these householders stood engaged to the king, as a pledge for the good behaviour of his family, and all the ten were mutually pledges for each other; so that if any one of the tythings was suspected of an offence, if the head boroughs or chiefs of the tythings would not be security for him, he was imprisoned; and, if he made his escape, the tything and hundred were fined to the king. Each shire was under the government of an earl, under whom was the reeve, his deputy; since, from his office, called foire-reeve, or sheriff. And so effectual were these regulations, that it is said he caused bracelets of gold to be hung up in the highways, as a challenge to robbers; and they remained untouched.\n\nIn private life, Alfred was the most amiable man in his dominions; of so equal a temper, that he never suffered either fadness or unbecoming gaiety to enter his mind; but appeared always of a calm, yet cheerful disposition, familiar to his friends, just even to his enemies, kind and tender to all. He was a remarkable economist of his time; and Asserius has given us an account of the method he took for dividing and keeping an account of it: he caused six wax-candles to be made, each of 12 inches long, and of as many ounces weight; on the candles the inches were regularly marked, and having found that one of them burnt just four hours, he committed them to the care of the keepers of his chapel, who from time to time gave him notice how the hours went: but as in windy weather the candles were wasted by the impression of the air on the flame, to remedy this inconvenience, he invented lanterns, there being then no glass in his dominions.\n\nThis prince, we are told, was 12 years of age before a master could be procured in the western kingdom.\n\n---\n\n(c) The king's contrivance is thought to have produced the meadow between Hertford and Bow; for at Hertford was the Danish fort, and from thence they made frequent excursions on the inhabitants of London. Authors are not agreed as to the method the king pursued in laying dry the Danish ships: Dugdale supposes that he did it by straightening the channels; but Henry of Huntingdon alleges, that he cut several canals, which exhausted its water.\nAlfred, to teach him the alphabet; such was the state of learning when Alfred began to reign. He had felt the misery of ignorance; and determined even to rival his contemporary Charlemagne in the encouragement of literature. He supposed to have appointed persons to read lectures at Oxford, and is hence considered as the founder of that university. By other proper establishments, and by a general encouragement to men of abilities, he did every thing in his power to diffuse knowledge throughout his dominions. Nor was this end promoted more by his countenance and encouragement than by his own example and his writings. For notwithstanding the lateness of his initiation, he had acquired extraordinary erudition; and, had he not been illustrious as a king, he would have been famous as an author. His works are, 1. Breviarium quoddam collectum ex Legibus Trajanorum, &c. Lib. i. A Breviary collected out of the laws of the Trojans, Greeks, Britons, Saxons, and Danes, in one book. Leland saw this book in the Saxon tongue, at Christ-church in Hampshire. 2. Vigi-Saxonum Leges, lib. i. The laws of the West-Saxons, in one book. Pitts tells us, that it is in Bennett-College library, at Cambridge. 3. Infinita quaedam, lib. i. Certain Institutes, in one book. This is mentioned by Pitts, and seems to be the second capitulation with Guthrum. 4. Contra Judices injuriosos, lib. i. An invective against Unjust Judges, in one book. 5. Acta Magistratus suorum, lib. i. Acts of his Magistrates, in one book. This is supposed to be the Book of Judgments mentioned by Horne; and was, in all probability, a kind of reports, intended for the use of succeeding ages. 6. Regum fortune variae, lib. i. The various Fortunes of Kings, in one book. 7. Dicta Sapientum, lib. i. The sayings of Wise Men, in one book. 8. Parabola et Sales, lib. i. Parables and pleasant Sayings, in one book. 9.

A Manual of Meditations.—Besides those original works, he translated many authors from the Latin, &c. into the Saxon language, viz. 1. Bede's History of England. 2. Paulinus Orosius's History of the Pagans. 3. St Gregory's Pastoral, &c. The first of these, with his prefaces to the others, together with his laws, were printed at Cambridge, 1644. His laws are likewise inserted in Spelman's Councils. 4. Boetius de Consolatione, lib. v. Boetius's Consolations of Philolophy, in five books. Dr Plot tells us, King Alfred translated it at Woodstock, as he found in a MS. in the Cotton Library. 5. Æsopi Fabulae, Æsop's Fables: which he is said to have translated from the Greek both into Latin and Saxon. 6. Paterium Davidicum, lib.i. David's Psalter, in one book. This was the last work the king attempted, death surprising him before he had finished it; it was, however, completed by another hand, and published at London in 1640, in quarto, by Sir John Spelman. Several others are mentioned by Malmesbury; and the old history of Ely asserts, that he translated the Old and New Testaments.\n\nThe life of this great king was first written by Alferius Mercensis; and first published by Archbishop Parker, in the old Saxon character, at the end of his edition of Hauntingham's history, printed in 1674, fol.\n\nALGA, in Botany, the trivial name of the lichen, fucus, and several other plants of the cryptogamia class.\n\nALGÆ, flags; one of the seven families or natural tribes into which the whole vegetable kingdom is divided by Linnaeus, in his Philosophia Botanica. They are defined to be plants, whose root, leaf, and stem, are all one. Under this description are comprehended all the sea-weeds, and some other aquatic plants. In the sexual system, they constitute the 3d order of the 24th class, Cryptogamia; in Tournefort, the second genus of the second section, Marine, aut flaviflora, of the 17th class, Alperae vulgo habitae; and the 57th order in Linnaeus's Fragments of a Natural Method. The discoveries made in this part of the vegetable kingdom are uncertain, and imperfect; and the attempts, in particular, to arrange flags by the parts of the fructification, have not been attended with great success. Dillenius has arranged this order of plants from their general habit and structure; Michelius from the parts of fructification.\n\nALGAGIOLA, a small sea-port town in the island of Corfica, fortified with walls and battions.

Led by curiosity, as well as a desire of improvement, he travelled early into foreign countries; and was very young when he arrived in France in 1736. Here he composed his \"Newtonian Philosophy for the Ladies;\" as Fontenelle had done his Cartesian Astronomy, in the work entitled \"The Plurality of worlds.\" He was noticed by the king of Prussia, who gave him marks of the esteem he had for him. He died at Pisa the 23d of May 1764; and ordered his own mausoleum, with this inscription to be fixed upon it: \"Hic jacet Algariotus, sed non omnis.\" He is allowed to have been a very great connoisseur in painting, sculpture, and architecture. He contributed much to the reformation of the Italian opera. His works, which are numerous, and upon a variety of subjects, abound with vivacity, elegance, and wit: a collection of them has lately been made, and printed at Leghorn in 1767, in 4 vols. 8vo.\n\nALGARVA, a province in the kingdom of Portugal, 67 miles in length and 20 in breadth; bounded on the west and south by the sea, on the east by the river Guadiana, and on the north by Alentejo.

It contains four cities, 12 towns, 67 parishes, and it is said, above 90,000 inhabitants.\n\nALGEBRA.\nALGEBRA.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n1. Algebra is a general method of reasoning, concerning the relations which magnitudes of every kind bear to each other in respect of quantity. It is sometimes called universal arithmetic; its first principles and operations being similar to those of common arithmetic. The symbols which it employs to denote magnitudes are, however, more general and more extensive in their application than those employed in that science; hence, and from the great facility with which the various relations of magnitudes to one another may be expressed, by means of a few signs or characters, the application of algebra to the resolution of problems is much more extensive than that of common arithmetic.\n\n2. There are various opinions as to the etymology of the name algebra. It is pretty certain, however, that the word is Arabic, and that from the Arabians the name, as well as the art itself, is derived. Lucas de Burgo, the first European author whose treatise on algebra was printed, calls it by the Arabic name Algebrà e Almucabala, which is explained to denote the art of restitution and comparison, or opposition and comparison, or resolution and equation, all which agree well enough with the nature of this art. Besides this etymology of the name algebra, several others have been imagined; that, however, which we have just now given seems to be the most probable of any hitherto assigned.\n\n3. The origin of algebra, as well as that of most other branches of mathematical science, is involved in obscurity; there are indeed traces of it to be found in the works of some of the earliest philosophers and mathematicians, the subject of whose writings must necessarily have led them to the discovery; and, in some measure, to the application of this science.\n\n4. The oldest treatise of algebra, which has come down to the present times, was written by Diophantus of Alexandria, who flourished about the year 350 after Christ, and who wrote 13 books on algebra or arithmetic in the Greek language; though only six of these have hitherto been printed, and one book, which is imperfect, on multangular numbers. It was not, however, from this author, but from the Moors or Arabians, that this, as well as most other sciences, was received in Europe; and some writers are of opinion, that they again received it from the Greeks, while others suppose that they had it from the Persians; and that these last derived algebra, as well as the arithmetical method of computing by ten characters or digits, from the Indians.\n\n5. The Arabians themselves say, that it was invented by Mahomet ben Musa or son of Moses, who it seems flourished about the 8th or 9th century. It seems more probable that Mahomet was not the inventor, but only a person well skilled in the art; and that the Arabians received their knowledge of it from Diophantus, or other Greek writers, as they did that of geometry and some other sciences, which they improved and translated into their own language.\n\n6. However this may be, it seems to be pretty certain, that the science was first brought to Europe about the beginning of the 15th century, by Leonardus Pisanus, who travelled into Arabia and other eastern countries for the purpose of acquiring mathematical knowledge; and, in a short time, it began to be cultivated in Italy, where it was called l'Arte Magiore, \"the greater art,\" to distinguish it from common arithmetic, which was called l'Arte Minore, \"the lesser art.\" It was also known in that country by the name Regola de la Cofa, or \"rule of the thing,\" where by Cofa, or the thing, was meant the first, or simple power of the unknown quantity.\n\n7. Between the years 1470 and 1487 Lucas Pacioli or Lucas de Burgo, a Cordelier, or Minorite friar, published several treatises on arithmetic, algebra, and geometry; and, in 1494, his principal work, entitled Summa de Arithmetica Proporioni et Proportionatis was printed. The part of this work, which relates to algebra, and which he calls l'Arte Magiore; diuia dal vulgo la Regola de la Cofa over Algebra e Almucabala, may be considered as exhibiting a pretty accurate state of the science, as it was then known in Europe; and probably it was much the same in Africa and Asia, from whence the Europeans derived the knowledge of it. It appears from this work, that their knowledge extended no farther than quadratic equations, of which they used only the positive roots; that they used only one unknown quantity; that they used no marks nor signs for either quantities or operations, excepting a few abbreviations of the words or names themselves; and that the art was only employed in the resolution of certain numeral problems. So that either the Africans had not carried algebra beyond quadratic equations; or else (what indeed is not improbable) the Europeans had not learned the whole of the art, as it was then known to the former.\n\n8. After the publication of the books of Lucas de Burgo, algebra became more generally known and improved, especially in Italy; for about the year 1505, Scipio Ferreus who was then professor of mathematics at Bologna, found out a rule for resolving one case of a compound cubic equation; but, as appears to have been the custom of the times with respect to such matters, he kept the rule a profound secret from his contemporaries. The same thing was afterwards discovered in 1535 by Nicolas Tartalea, who then resided in Venice, and who had five years before found the resolution of two other cases of cubic equations.\n\n9. The next work upon algebra which was printed after the books of Lucas de Burgo, was written by Hieronymus Cardan, of Bologna, a very learned man, who published in 1539 his arithmetical writings, in nine books, at Milan, where he practised physic, and read public lectures on mathematics. The same author in 1545 published a tenth book, containing the whole doctrine of cubic equations, which had been in part communicated to him under an oath of secrecy.\nby Tartalea, but which, notwithstanding this circumstance, Cardan thought proper to publish, alleging (not altogether without reason) that he had made to many additions to Tartalea's discovery so as to render it in a manner his own. Accordingly we find, that even to the present times, the common rule for resolving cubic equations is generally known by the name of Cardan's rule, although it would certainly be more just to attribute it to its first inventor, Tartalea.\n\n10. Equations of the fourth order appear to have been first resolved by Lewis Ferrari, a disciple of Cardan's; and different methods of resolution were afterwards given by Descartes and others. This indeed is the greatest length that mathematicians have been able to carry the resolution of equations; for, with respect to those of the fifth, and all higher degrees, all attempts to resolve them, except in particular cases, have hitherto been found impracticable.\n\n11. After this period, writers on algebra became more numerous; and many improvements were gradually made, both in the notation and in the theory of the science. Among other writers who cultivated it with success may be reckoned Bombelli, another Italian mathematician; Stifelius and Scheutellius, both of Germany; Robert Recorde, an English mathematician; and many others.\n\n12. Among the mathematicians to whom algebra is particularly indebted, it is proper to mention Francis Vieta, a native of France, who wrote about the year 1600. Among various improvements in all parts of the science, he first introduced the general use of the letters of the alphabet, to denote indefinite given quantities, which, before his time, had only been done in some particular cases. The English mathematician, Harriot, deserves also to be particularly mentioned. His algebra, which was published after his death, in 1631, shows that he cultivated that science with great success. For, besides improving the notation, so as to render it nearly the same as it is at present, he first explained clearly a most important proposition in the theory of equations, namely, that an equation of any degree may be considered as produced by the continual multiplication of as many simple equations as there are units in the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity in that equation: Hence he showed the relation which subsists between the coefficients of the terms of an equation and its roots.\n\n13. Without mentioning all the writers on algebra who flourished about this time, and who severally contributed more or less to its improvement, we proceed to observe, that nothing has contributed more to the advancement of every branch of mathematical knowledge than the happy application which the celebrated philosopher Descartes made of algebra to the science of geometry; for his geometry, first published in 1637, may be considered rather as the application of algebra to geometry than as either algebra or geometry taken by itself as a science. Besides this happy union effected between the two sciences, Descartes contributed much to the improvement of both; and indeed he may be considered as having paved the way for all the discoveries which have since been made in mathematics.\n\n14. After the publication of Descartes' Geometry, the science of algebra may be considered as having attained some degree of perfection. It has, however, received many improvements from later writers who, pursuing the paths struck out by Harriot and Descartes, have produced many new and beautiful theories, both in algebra and geometry. The writers upon algebra from this time became too numerous, and the respective improvements made by each too minute, to be particularly noticed in this introduction. It is, however, necessary to mention another mathematician, to whom algebra lies under considerable obligations, namely, M. Fermat, who may be considered as the rival of Descartes; for it appears that he was in possession of the method of applying algebra to the improvement of geometry before the publication of the celebrated work of the latter philosopher. Besides, Fermat appears to have been deeply versed in the theory of indeterminate problems; and he republished the oldest and most esteemed treatise upon that subject which is known, namely, Diophantus's Arithmetic, to which he added many valuable notes of his own.\n\n15. Having now given a brief account of the origin of algebra, and of the writers who contributed the most to bring it to the state of perfection it had attained about the middle of the 17th century, which indeed was considerable, we shall conclude this introduction, by observing, that although its progress has since been very gradual, it has been upon the whole considerably improved; particularly by the labours of these foreign mathematicians, Schooten, Hudde, Van Heuraet, De Witte, Slusius, Huygens, &c. As to the algebraical writers of our own country, whose whole labours have been most conspicuous were Wallis, and more especially Sir I. Newton, to whom, among other things, we owe the invention of the binomial theorem: also Pell, Barrow, Kersey, Halley, Raphson, and many others. We now proceed to explain the science itself.\n\nNotation and Explanation of the Signs.\n\n16. In arithmetic there are ten characters, which being variously combined, according to certain rules, serve to denote all magnitudes whatever. But this method of expressing quantities, although of the greatest utility in every branch of the mathematics, (for we must always have recourse to it in the different applications of that science to practical purposes) is yet found to be inadequate, taken by itself, to the more difficult cases of mathematical investigation; and it is therefore necessary in many inquiries concerning the relations of magnitude, to have recourse to that more general mode of notation, and more extensive system of operations, which constitute the science of algebra.\n\n17. In algebra quantities of every kind may be denoted by any characters whatever, but those commonly used are the letters of the alphabet: And as in every mathematical problem, there are certain magnitudes given, in order to determine other magnitudes, which are unknown, the first letters of the alphabet, a, b, c, &c., are used to denote known quantities, while those to be found are represented by v, x, y, &c. the last letters of the alphabet.\n\n18. The sign + (plus) denotes that the quantity before which it is placed is to be added to some other quantity. Thus \\(a + b\\) denotes the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); \\(3 + 5\\) denotes the sum of 3 and 5, or 8.\n\n19. The sign — (minus) signifies that the quantity before\nNotation. before which it is placed is to be subtracted. Thus \\(a - b\\) denotes the excess of \\(a\\) above \\(b\\); \\(6 - 2\\) is the excess of 6 above 2, or 4.\n\n20. Quantities which have the sign + prefixed to them are called positive or affirmative; and such as have the sign — are called negative.\n\nWhen quantities are considered abstractedly, the terms positive and negative can only mean that such quantities are to be added or subtracted; for as it is impossible to conceive a number less than 0, it follows, that a negative quantity by itself is unintelligible. But, in considering the affections of magnitude, it appears, that in many cases, a certain opposition may exist in the nature of quantities. Thus, a person's property may be considered as a positive quantity, and his debts as a negative quantity. Again, any portion of a line drawn to the right hand may be considered as positive, while a portion of the same line, continued in the opposite direction, may be taken as negative.\n\nWhen no sign is prefixed to a quantity, + is always understood, or the quantity is to be considered as positive.\n\n21. Quantities which have the same sign, either + or —, are said to have like signs. Thus, \\(+a\\) and \\(+b\\) have like signs, but \\(+a\\) and \\(-c\\) have unlike signs.\n\n22. A quantity which consists of one term, is said to be simple; but if it consist of several terms, connected by the signs + or —, it is then said to be compound. Thus \\(+a\\) and \\(-c\\) are simple quantities; and \\(b + c\\), also \\(+a + b - d\\) are compound quantities.\n\n23. To denote the product arising from the multiplication of quantities; if they be simple, they are either joined together, as if intended to form a word, or else the quantities are connected together, with the sign \\(\\times\\) interposed between every two of them. Thus \\(ab\\), or \\(a \\times b\\), denotes the product of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); also \\(abc\\), or \\(a \\times b \\times c\\) denotes the product of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\); the latter method is used when the quantities to be multiplied are numbers. If some of the quantities to be multiplied be compound, each of them has a line drawn over it called a vinculum, and the sign \\(\\times\\) is interposed between as before. Thus \\(a \\times c + d \\times e - f\\) denotes that \\(a\\) is to be considered as one quantity, the sum of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) as a second, and the difference between \\(e\\) and \\(f\\) as a third; and that these three quantities are to be multiplied into one another. Instead of placing a line over such compound quantities as enter a product, it is now common among mathematical writers to enclose each of them between two parentheses, so that the last product may be otherwise expressed thus, \\(a(c+d)(e-f)\\), or thus, \\(a \\times (c+d) \\times (e-f)\\).\n\n24. A number prefixed to a letter is called a numerical coefficient, and denotes how often that quantity is to be taken. Thus, \\(3a\\) signifies that \\(a\\) is to be taken three times. When no number is prefixed, the coefficient is understood to be unity.\n\n25. The quotient arising from the division of one quantity by another is expressed by placing the dividend above a line, and the divisor below it. Thus \\(\\frac{12}{3}\\) denotes the quotient arising from the division of 12 by 3, or 4; \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) denotes the quotient arising from the division of \\(b\\) by \\(a\\). This expression of a quotient is also called Addition, a fraction.\n\n26. The equality of two quantities is expressed by putting the sign = between them. Thus \\(a + b = c - d\\) denotes that the sum of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is equal to the excess of \\(c\\) above \\(d\\).\n\n27. Simple quantities, or the terms of compound quantities, are said to be like, which consist of the same letter or letters. Thus \\(+ab\\) and \\(-5ab\\) are like quantities; but \\(+ab\\) and \\(+abb\\) are unlike.\n\nThere are some other characters which will be explained when we have occasion to use them; and in what follows we shall suppose that the operations of common arithmetic are sufficiently understood; for algebra, being an extension of that science, ought not to be embarrassed by the demonstration of its elementary rules.\n\nSect. I. Fundamental Operations.\n\n28. The primary operations in algebra are the same as in common arithmetic, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; and from the various combinations of these four, all the others are derived.\n\nProblem I. To Add Quantities.\n\n29. In addition there may be three cases: the quantities to be added may be like, and have like signs; or, they may be like, and have unlike signs; or, lastly, they may be unlike.\n\nCase 1. To add quantities which are like, and have like signs.\n\nRule. Add together the coefficients of the quantities, prefix the common sign to the sum, and annex the letter, or letters, common to each term.\n\nExamples.\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 7a \\\\\n+ & 3a \\\\\n+ & a \\\\\n+ & 2a\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(+13a\\)\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n- & 2ax \\\\\n- & ax \\\\\n- & 5ax \\\\\n- & 12ax\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(-20ax\\)\n\nCase 2. To add quantities which are like, but have unlike signs.\n\nRule. Add the positive coefficients into one sum, and the negative ones into another; then subtract the least of these sums from the greatest, prefix the sign of the greatest to the remainder, and annex the common letter, or letters, as before.\n\nExamples.\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 2ax \\\\\n- & ax \\\\\n- & 3ax \\\\\n+ & 9ax\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum of the pos. \\(+11ax\\)\n\nAdd together \\[\n\\begin{align*}\n+ & 6ab \\\\\n+ & ab \\\\\n+ & 7ab \\\\\n- & 13\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum of the pos. \\(+14ab\\)\n\nSum of the neg. \\(-4ab\\)\n\nSum required, \\(+7ax\\)\n\nSum required, \\(+1cab\\)\n\n\\(aa+\\)\nALGEBRA.\n\nSubtraction.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\naa + 2ax & - xx = -4aab \\\\\n-2aa + 3ax & - 4xx + aab \\\\\n6aa - 5ax + 11xx & + 3aab \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(5aa\\) \\(+ 6ax\\) Sum, \\(0\\)\n\nCase 3. To add unlike quantities.\n\nRule. Put down the quantities, one after another, in any order, with their signs and coefficients prefixed.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2a & \\quad ax + 2ay \\\\\n3b & \\quad bb - 3bx \\\\\n-4c & \\quad \\text{Sum, } ax + 2ay + bb - 3bx \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSum, \\(2a + 3b - 4c\\)\n\nProb. II. To Subtract Quantities.\n\n30. General Rule. Change the signs of the quantities to be subtracted, or suppose them changed, and then add them to the other quantities, agreeably to the rules of addition.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{From } 5a - 12b & \\quad \\text{From } 6x - 8y + 3 \\\\\n\\text{Subtract } 2a - 5b & \\quad \\text{Subtract } 2x + 9y - 2 \\\\\n\\text{Remainder } 3a - 7b & \\quad \\text{Remainder } 4x - 17y + 5 \\\\\n5xy - 2 + 8x - y & \\quad aa - ax - yy \\\\\n3xy - 8 - 8x - 3y & \\quad bb - by + zz \\\\\n2xy + 6 + 16x + 2y & \\quad aa - ax - yy - bb + by - zz \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n31. The reason of the rule for subtraction may be explained thus. Let it be required to subtract \\(2p - 3q\\) from \\(m + n\\). If we subtract \\(2p\\) from \\(m + n\\) there will remain \\(m + n - 2p\\); but if we are to subtract \\(2p - 3q\\), which is less than \\(2p\\), it is evident that the remainder will be greater by a quantity equal to \\(3q\\); that is, the remainder will be \\(m + n - 2p + 3q\\); hence the reason of the rule is evident.\n\nProb. III. To Multiply Quantities.\n\n32. General Rule for the Signs. If the quantities to be multiplied have like signs, the sign of the product is \\(+\\); but if they have unlike signs, the sign of the product is \\(-\\).\n\n33. The examples of multiplication may be referred to two cases; the first is when both the quantities are simple; and the second when one or both of them are compound.\n\nCase I. To multiply simple quantities.\n\nRule. Find the sign of the product by the general rule, and annex to it the product of the numeral coefficients, then set down all the letters, one after another, as in one word.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Multiply } +a & \\quad +b \\\\\n\\text{By } +c & \\quad -4a \\\\\n\\text{Product } +ac & \\quad -20ab \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nCase II. To multiply compound quantities.\n\nRule. Multiply every term of the multiplicand by all the terms of the multiplier, one after another, by the preceding rule, and collect their products into one sum, which will be the product required.\n\nExamples.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Multiply } 4a - 2b + c & \\quad 2x + y \\\\\n\\text{By } 3a & \\quad x - 2y \\\\\n\\text{Product } 12aa - 6ab + 3ac & \\quad 2xx + xy \\\\\n& \\quad - 4xy - 2yy \\\\\n& \\quad 2xx - 3xy - 2yy \\\\\naa - ab + bb & \\quad a - b + c \\\\\na + b & \\quad a + b - c \\\\\naac - aab + abb & \\quad aa - ab + ac \\\\\n+ aab - abb + bbb & \\quad + ab - bb + bc \\\\\naaa & \\quad * + bbb \\\\\naa & \\quad * * - bb + 2bc - cc \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n34. The reason of the rules for the multiplication of quantities may be explained in the following manner: Let it be required to multiply \\(a - b\\) by \\(c - d\\); because multiplication is a repeated addition of the multiplicand as often as the multiplier contains unity, therefore, \\(a - b\\) is to be taken as often as there are units in \\(c - d\\), and the sum will be the product required. Now if \\(a - b\\) be taken as often as there are units in \\(c\\), the result will evidently exceed the product required, and that by a quantity equal to \\(a - b\\), taken as often as there are units in \\(d\\). But, from the nature of addition \\(a - b\\) taken as often as there are units in \\(c\\), is \\(ca - cb\\), and for the same reason, \\(a - b\\) taken as often as there are units in \\(d\\) is \\(da - db\\); therefore, to obtain the product required, we must subtract \\(da - db\\) from \\(ca - cb\\); but from what has been shewn in subtraction, the remainder will be \\(ca - cb - da + db\\); therefore the product arising from the multiplication of \\(a - b\\) by \\(c - d\\) is \\(ca - cb - da + db\\); hence the reason of the general rule for the signs, as well as the other rules, is manifest.\n\n35. When several quantities are multiplied together so as to constitute a product, each of them is called a factor of that product; thus, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are factors of the product \\(abc\\); also \\(a + x\\), and \\(b - x\\) are factors of the product \\((a + x)(b - x)\\).\n\n36. The products arising from the continual multiplication of the same quantity are called powers of that quantity, which is called the root. Thus \\(aa\\), \\(aaa\\), \\(aaaa\\), &c. are powers of the root \\(a\\). These powers are commonly expressed, by placing above the root, towards the right hand, a figure, denoting how often the root is repeated. This figure serves to denote the power, and is called its index or exponent. Thus, the quantity \\(a\\) being considered as the root, or as the first power of \\(a\\), we have \\(aa\\) or \\(a^2\\) for its second power,\nDivision.\n\npower, \\(a^2\\) or \\(a^3\\) for its third power, \\(aaaa\\) or \\(a^4\\) for its fourth power, and so on.\n\n37. The second and third powers of a quantity are generally called its square and cube; and the fourth, fifth, and sixth powers are sometimes respectively called its biquadrate, sexfoil, and cubocube.\n\n38. By considering the notation of powers, and the rules for multiplication, it appears that powers of the same root are multiplied by adding their exponents. Thus \\(a \\times a^2 = a^3\\), also \\(x^3 \\times x^4 = x^7\\); and in general \\(a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}\\).\n\nProb. IV. To Divide Quantities.\n\n39. General Rule for the Signs. If the signs of the divisor and dividend be like, the sign of the quotient is +; but if they be unlike, the sign of the quotient is −.\n\nThis rule is easily derived from the general rule for the signs in multiplication, by considering that the quotient must be such a quantity as when multiplied by the divisor shall produce the dividend, with its proper sign.\n\n40. The quotient arising from the division of one quantity by another may be expressed by placing the dividend above a line and the divisor below it, (§ 25), but it may also be often expressed in a more simple manner by the following rules:\n\nCase 1. When the divisor is simple, and a factor of every term of the dividend.\n\nRule. Divide the coefficient of each term of the dividend by the coefficient of the divisor, and expunge out of each term the letter or letters in the divisor; the result is the quotient.\n\nEx. 1. Divide \\(12abc\\) by \\(3ac\\).\n\nFrom the method of notation, the quotient may be expressed thus \\(\\frac{12abc}{3ac}\\); but the same quotient, by the rule just given, is more simply expressed thus \\(4b\\).\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\(16a^3xy - 28a^2xz^3 + 4a^4x^3\\) by \\(4ax\\).\n\nThe quotient is \\(4ay - 7xz^3 + x^3\\).\n\nIf the divisor and dividend be powers of the same quantity, the division will evidently be performed by subtracting the exponent of the divisor from that of the dividend. Thus \\(a^3\\) divided by \\(a^2\\) has for a quotient \\(a^3 - 2 = a\\).\n\nCase 2. When the divisor is simple, but not a factor of the dividend.\n\nRule. The quotient is expressed by a fraction, of which the numerator is the dividend, and the denominator the divisor.\n\nThus the quotient of \\(3ab^2\\) divided by \\(2mbc\\) is the fraction \\(\\frac{3ab^2}{2mbc}\\).\n\nIt will sometimes happen, that the quotient found thus may be reduced to a more simple form, as shall be explained when we come to treat of fractions.\n\nCase 3. When the divisor is compound.\n\nRule. 1. The terms of the dividend are to be arranged according to the powers of some one of its letters, and those of the divisor according to the powers of the same letter.\n\n2. The first term of the dividend is to be divided by the first term of the divisor, observing the general rule for the signs; and this quotient being let down for a part of the quotient wanted, is to be multiplied by the whole divisor, and the product subtracted from the dividend. If nothing remain, the division is finished; but if there be a remainder, it is to be taken for a new dividend.\n\n3. The first term of the new dividend is next to be divided by the first term of the divisor, as before, and the quotient joined to the part already found, with its proper sign. The whole divisor is also to be multiplied by this part of the quotient, and the product subtracted from the new dividend; and thus the operation is to be carried on till there be no remainder, or till it appear that there will always be a remainder.\n\nTo illustrate this rule, let it be required to divide \\(8a^3 + 2ab - 15b^2\\) by \\(2a + 3b\\); the operation will stand thus,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&2a + 3b)8a^3 + 2ab - 15b^2(4a - 5b \\\\\n&\\quad 8a^3 + 12ab \\\\\n&\\quad - 10ab - 15b^2 \\\\\n&\\quad - 10ab - 15b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the terms of the divisor and dividend are arranged according to the powers of the quantity \\(a\\). We now divide \\(8a^3\\), the first term of the dividend, by \\(2a\\) the first term of the divisor; and thus get \\(4a\\) for the first term of the quotient. We next multiply the divisor by \\(4a\\), and subtract the product \\(8a^3 + 12ab\\) from the dividend; we thus get \\(-10ab - 15b^2\\) for a new dividend.\n\nBy proceeding in all respects as before, we find \\(-5b\\) for the second term of the quotient, and no remainder; the operation is therefore finished, and the whole quotient is \\(4a - 5b\\).\n\nThe following examples will also serve to illustrate the manner of applying the rule.\n\nEx. 1.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3a - b)3a^2 - 12a^2 - ab + 10ab - 2b^2(a^2 - 4a + 2b \\\\\n3a^3 - a^2b \\\\\n- 12a^2 + 10ab \\\\\n+ 6ab - 2b^2 \\\\\n+ 6ab - 2b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nEx. 2.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b)a^2 + b^2(a^2 - ab + b^2 \\\\\na^3 + a^2b \\\\\n- a^2b + b^2 \\\\\n- a^2b - ab^2 \\\\\n+ ab^2 - b^2 \\\\\n+ ab^2 - b^2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nEx. 3.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^6 - b^6} = \\frac{(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)}{(a^3 - b^3)(a^3 + b^3)}\n\\]\n\nEx. 4.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1-x} = (1+x+x^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n41. Sometimes, as in this last example, the quotient will never terminate; in such a case it may either be considered as an infinite series, the law according to which the terms are formed being in general sufficiently obvious; or the quotient may be completed as in arithmetical division, by annexing to it a fraction, the numerator of which is the remainder, and denominator the divisor. Thus the quotient in last example may stand thus \\(1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots\\).\n\n42. The reason of the rule for division is sufficiently manifest. For in the course of the operation, all the terms of the quotient obtained by it are multiplied by all the terms of the divisor, and the products successively subtracted from the dividend, till nothing remain; and therefore must evidently be the true quotient.\n\nSect. II. Of Fractions.\n\n43. In the operation of division, the divisor may be sometimes less than the dividend, or may not be contained in it an exact number of times; in either case the quotient is expressed by means of a fraction. There can be no difficulty, however, in estimating the magnitude of such a quotient; if, for example it were the fraction \\(\\frac{5}{7}\\), we may consider it as denoting either that some unit is divided into 7 equal parts, and that 5 of these are taken, or that 5 times the same unit is divided into 7 equal parts, and one of them taken.\n\n44. In any fraction the upper number, or the dividend is called the numerator, and the lower number or the divisor is called the denominator. Thus in the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), \\(a\\) is the numerator, and \\(b\\) the denominator.\n\n45. If the numerator be less than the denominator, such a fraction is called a proper fraction; but if the numerator be either equal to, or greater than the denominator, it is called an improper fraction; and if a quantity be made up of an integer and a fraction, it is called a mixed quantity. Thus \\(\\frac{a}{a+x}\\) is a proper fraction; \\(\\frac{a}{a}\\), also \\(\\frac{a+x}{a}\\) are both improper fractions; and \\(b+\\frac{x}{a}\\) is a mixed quantity.\n\n46. The reciprocal of a fraction is another fraction, having its numerator and denominator respectively equal to the denominator and numerator of the former.\n\nThus \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) is the reciprocal of the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\).\n\n47. The following proposition is of great importance in the operations relating to fractions.\n\nIf the numerator and denominator of a fraction be either both multiplied, or both divided by the same quantity, the value of that fraction is the same as before.\n\nFor let any fraction \\(\\frac{b}{a} = c\\); then because \\(c\\) is the quotient arising from the division of \\(b\\) by \\(a\\), it follows that \\(b = ac\\); and multiplying both by any quantity \\(n\\), we have \\(nb = nac\\); let these equals be both divided by the same quantity \\(na\\), and the quotients will be equal, that is \\(\\frac{nb}{na} = \\frac{c}{a}\\); hence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n48. From this proposition, it is obvious that a fraction may be very differently expressed, without changing its value, and that any integer may be reduced to the form of a fraction, by placing the product arising from its multiplication by any assumed quantity as the numerator, and the assumed quantity as the denominator of the fraction. It also appears that a fraction very complex in its form may often be reduced to another of the same value, but more simple, by finding a quantity which will divide both the numerator and denominator, without leaving a remainder. Such a common measure, or common divisor, may be either simple or compound; if it be simple, it is readily found by inspection, but if it be compound, it may be found as in the following problem.\n\n49. Prob. I. To find the greatest common Measure of two Quantities.\n\nRule 1. Range the quantities according to the powers of some one of the letters, as taught in division, leaving out the simple divisors of each quantity.\n\n2. Divide that quantity which is of most dimensions by the other one, and if there be a remainder, divide it by its greatest simple divisor; and then divide the last compound divisor by the resulting quantity, and if anything yet remains, divide it also by its greatest simple divisor, and the last compound divisor by the resulting quantity: proceed in this way till nothing remain, and the last divisor shall be the common measure required.\n\nNote. It will sometimes be necessary to multiply the dividends by simple quantities in order to make the divisions succeed.\n\nEx. 1. Required the greatest common measure of the quantities \\(a^2x - x^3\\) and \\(a^2 - 2ax + ax^2\\). The simple divisor \\(x\\) being taken out of the former of these quantities, and \\(a\\) out of the latter, they are reduced to \\(a^2 - x^2\\), and \\(a^2 - 2ax + x^2\\), and as the quantity \\(a\\) rises to the same dimensions in both, we may take either of them as the first divisor; let us take that which consists of fewest terms, and the operation will stand thus:\nFractions:\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 - x^2}{a^2 - ax + x^2} = \\frac{-2ax + x^2}{-2x} \\]\n\nwhich divided by \\(-2x\\) is \\(a - x\\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^2 - ax}{a^2 - ax} \\]\n\nHence it appears that \\(a - x\\) is the greatest common measure required.\n\n**Ex. 2.** Required the greatest common measure of \\(8a^3b^3 - 10ab^3 + 2b^4\\) and \\(9a^3b - 9a^3b^3 + 3a^3b^3 - 3ab^3\\).\n\nIt is evident, from inspection, that \\(b\\) is a simple divisor of both quantities; it will therefore be a factor of the common measure required. Let the simple divisors be now left out of each quantity, and they are reduced to \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\) and \\(3a^3 - 3a^3b + ab^3 - b^3\\); but as the second of these is to be divided by the first, it must be multiplied by 4 to make the division succeed, and the operation will stand thus:\n\n\\[ (4a^3 - 5ab + b^3)(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3) \\]\n\nThis remainder is to be divided by \\(b\\), and the new dividend multiplied by 3, to make the division again succeed, and the work will stand thus:\n\n\\[ 3a^3 + ab - 4b^3(3a^3 + 4b^3) \\]\n\nThis remainder is to be divided by \\(19b\\), which being done, and the last divisor taken as a dividend as before, the rest of the operation will be as follows:\n\n\\[ a - b(3a^3 + 4b^3) \\]\n\nfrom which it appears that the compound divisor sought is \\(a - b\\), and remarking that the quantities proposed have also a simple divisor \\(b\\), the greatest common measure which is required will be \\(b(a - b)\\).\n\n**5c.** The reason of the rule given in this problem may be deduced from the following considerations.\n\n1. If two quantities have a compound divisor common to both, and they be either multiplied or divided by any simple quantities, the results will each have the same compound divisor. Thus the quantities \\(p(a - x)\\) and \\(q(a - x)\\) have the common divisor \\(a - x\\), and the quantities \\(np(a - x)\\) and \\(rq(a - x)\\) have each the very same divisor.\n\n2. In the operation of division, whatever quantity measures both the divisor and dividend, the same will also measure the remainder. For let \\(x\\) be such a quantity, then the divisor and dividend may be represented by \\(ax\\) and \\(bx\\); let \\(q\\) be the quotient, and the remainder will evidently be \\(bx - qx\\), which is evidently divisible by \\(x\\).\n\n3. Whatever quantity measures both the divisor and remainder, the same will also measure the dividend. For let the divisor be \\(ax\\), and the remainder \\(rx\\), then \\(q\\) denoting the quotient, the dividend will be \\(apx + rx\\), which, as well as the divisor and dividend, is divisible by \\(x\\).\n\n**5f.** Let us apply these observations to the last example. From the first observation, the reason for leaving out the simple quantities in the course of the operation, as well as for multiplying by certain other quantities, to make the divisions succeed, is obvious; and from the second observation it appears that whatever quantity measures \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\) and \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\), the same must measure \\(3a^3 + ab - 4b^3\\); the first remainder, as also \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\); the second remainder; but the only compound divisor which this last quantity can have is \\(a - b\\), which is also found to be a divisor of \\(3a^3 + ab - 4b^3\\), or of \\(3a^3b + ab^3 - 4b^3\\); the first remainder, therefore, by the third observation, \\(a - b\\) must also be a divisor of \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\), or of \\(4a^3 - 5ab + b^3\\), the first divisor, and therefore also it must be a divisor of \\(12a^3 - 12a^3b + 4ab^3 - 4b^3\\) the first dividend, so that \\(a - b\\) is the greatest common measure as was required.\n\n**52. Prob. II. To Reduce a Fraction to its lowest Terms.**\n\n**Rule.** Divide both numerator and denominator by their greatest common measure, which may be found by prob. 1.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Reduce \\(\\frac{56a^3bc}{24abc}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nIt appears from inspection, that the greatest common measure is \\(8ac\\), and dividing both numerator and denominator by this quantity, we have \\(\\frac{56a^3bc}{24abc} = \\frac{7ab}{3dc}\\).\n\n**Ex. 2.** Reduce \\(\\frac{a^3 - x^3}{a^3 - 2a^3x + ax^3}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nWe have already found in the first example of prob. 1. that the greatest common measure of the numerator and denominator is \\(a - x\\); and dividing both by this quantity we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{a^3 - x^3}{a^3 - 2a^3x + ax^3} = \\frac{ax + x^3}{a^3 - ax} \\]\n\nIn like manner we find \\(\\frac{9a^3b - 9a^3b^3 + 3a^3b^3 - 3ab^3}{8a^3b^3 - 10ab^3 + 2b^4} = \\frac{9a^3 + 3ab^3}{8ab - 2b^3}\\); the common measure being \\(b(a - b)\\) as was shown in example 2, problem 1.\n\n**53. Prob. III. To Reduce a mixed Quantity to an improper Fraction.**\n\n**Rule.** Multiply the integer by the denominator of the fraction, and to the product add the numerator, and the denominator being placed under this sum will give the improper fraction required.\nEx. 1.

Prob. V. To Reduce Fractions of Different Denominators to Others of the Same Value Which Shall Have a Common Denominator.\n\nRule. Multiply each numerator separately into all the denominators except its own for the new numerators, and all the denominators together for the common denominator.\n\nEx. 1.

Prob. VI. To Add or Subtract Fractions.\n\nRule. Reduce the fractions to a common denominator, and add or subtract their numerators, and the sum or difference placed over the common denominator, is the sum or remainder required.\n\nEx. 1. Add together \\( \\frac{a}{b}, \\frac{c}{d}, \\frac{e}{f} \\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{adf}{bd} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{bcf}{bd} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{e}{f} = \\frac{bde}{bd} \\]\n\nHence \\( \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f} = \\frac{adf + bcf + bde}{bd} \\) the sum required.\n\nEx. 2.

Add together \\( \\frac{x + 2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{2}, \\frac{2}{2} \\).\n\n\\[ \\frac{x + 2}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{4}{2} = \\frac{8x + 16 + 6x + 12x - 69}{24} = \\frac{13x - 22}{12} \\]\n\nIf it be required to add or subtract mixed quantities, they may either be reduced to the form of fractions by prob. 3. and then added, or subtracted, or else these operations may be performed first on the integer quantities, and afterwards on the fractions.\n\n57. Prob. VII. To Multiply Fractions.\n\nRule. Multiply the numerators of the fractions for the numerator of the product, and the denominators for the denominator of the product.\n\nEx. 1. Multiply \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\times \\frac{d}{c} \\) by \\( \\frac{bd}{ac} \\) the product required.\n\nEx. 2. Multiply \\( \\frac{a + b}{c} \\times \\frac{a - b}{d} \\) by \\( \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{cd} \\), the product.\n\nIf it be required to multiply an integer by a fraction, the integer may be considered as having unity for a denominator. Thus \\( (a + x) \\times \\frac{3d}{c} = \\frac{a + x}{1} \\times \\frac{3d}{c} = \\frac{3ad + 3dx}{c} \\).\nMixed quantities may be multiplied after being reduced to the form of fractions by prob. 3. Thus\n\n\\[\n(b + \\frac{bx}{a}) \\times \\frac{a}{n} = \\frac{ab + bx}{a} \\times \\frac{a}{n} = \\frac{ab + abx}{an} = \\frac{ab + bx}{n}.\n\\]\n\n58. The reason of the rule for multiplication may be explained thus. If \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) is to be multiplied by \\( c \\), the product will evidently be \\( \\frac{ac}{b} \\); but if it is only to be multiplied by \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\), the former product must be divided by \\( d \\), and it becomes \\( \\frac{ac}{bd} \\) which is the product required.\n\nOr let \\( \\frac{a}{b} = m \\), and \\( \\frac{c}{d} = n \\), then \\( a = bm \\) and \\( c = dn \\) and \\( ac = bdmn \\); hence \\( mn \\), or \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ac}{bd} \\).\n\n59. Prob. VIII. To Divide Fractions.\n\nRule. Multiply the denominator of the divisor by the numerator of the dividend for the numerator of the quotient. Then multiply the numerator of the divisor by the denominator of the dividend for the denominator of the quotient.\n\nOr, multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor, the product will be the quotient required.\n\nEx. 1. Divide \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\) by \\( \\frac{c}{d} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n\\]\n\nthe quotient required, or \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac{ad}{bc} \\) as before.\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\( \\frac{a^2 + ab}{2x} \\) by \\( \\frac{3a^3}{a - b} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3a^3}{a - b} \\div \\frac{a^2 + ab}{2x} = \\frac{6a^2}{6a^3} = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{6ax}\n\\]\n\nthe quotient.\n\nIf either the divisor or dividend be an integer quantity, it may be represented as a fraction, by placing unity for a denominator; or if it be a mixed quantity, it may be reduced to a fraction by prob. 3. and the operation of division performed agreeably to the rule.\n\n60. The reason of the rule for division may be explained thus, let it be required to divide \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) by \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\). If \\( \\frac{c}{a} \\) is to be divided by \\( a \\), the quotient is \\( \\frac{c}{ad} \\); but if it is to be divided by \\( \\frac{a}{b} \\), then the last quotient must be multiplied by \\( b \\); thus we have \\( \\frac{cb}{ad} \\) for the quotient required. Or let \\( \\frac{a}{b} = m \\), and \\( \\frac{c}{d} = n \\), then \\( a = bm \\) and \\( c = dn \\); also \\( ad = bdm \\) and \\( bc = bdn \\); therefore \\( \\frac{bdn}{bdm} = \\frac{n}{m} = \\frac{bc}{ad} \\).\n\nSect. III. Of Involution and Evolution.\n\n61. In treating of multiplication, we have observed, that when a quantity is multiplied by itself any number of times, the product is called a power of that quantity, while the quantity itself, from which the powers are formed, is called the root (§ 36.). Thus \\( a \\), \\( a^2 \\), and \\( a^3 \\) are the first, second, and third powers of the root \\( a \\); and in like manner \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), and \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\) denote the same powers of the root \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\).\n\n62. But before considering more particularly what relates to powers and roots, it will be proper to observe, that the quantities \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\), &c. admit of being expressed under a different form; for, like as the quantities \\( a \\), \\( a^2 \\), \\( a^3 \\), &c. are expressed as positive powers of the root \\( a \\), so the quantities \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\), &c. may be respectively expressed thus, \\( a^{-1} \\), \\( a^{-2} \\), \\( a^{-3} \\), &c. and considered as negative powers of the root \\( a \\).\n\n63. This method of expressing the fractions \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\) as powers of the root \\( a \\), but with negative indices, is a consequence of the rule which has been given for the division of powers; for we may consider \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) as the quotient arising from the division of any power of \\( a \\) by the next higher power, for example from the division of the 2d by the 3d, and so we have \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = a^{-2} \\); but since powers of the same quantity are divided by subtracting the exponent of the divisor from that of the dividend (§ 40.), it follows, that \\( \\frac{a^4}{a^3} = a^{4-3} = a^{-1} \\); therefore the fraction \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\) may also be expressed thus, \\( a^{-1} \\). By considering \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\) as equal to \\( \\frac{a^2}{a^4} \\), it will appear in the same manner that \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{a^2}{a^5} = a^{-3} \\); and, proceeding in this way, we get \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{a^2}{a^5} = a^{-2} \\), \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} = \\frac{a^3}{a^6} = a^{-3} \\), &c. and so on, as far as we please. It also appears, that unity or 1 may be represented by \\( a^0 \\), where the exponent is a cypher, for \\( 1 = \\frac{a^0}{a^0} = a^{-0} = a^0 \\).\n\n64. The rules which have been given for the multiplication and division of powers with positive exponents will apply in every case, whether the exponents be positive or negative, and this must evidently take place, for the mode of notation, by which we represent fractional quantities as the powers of integers, but with negative exponents has been derived from those rules.\n\nThus \\( \\frac{1}{a^2} \\times a^3 \\) or \\( a^{-2} \\times a^3 = a^{-2+3} = a^1 = \\frac{1}{a^2} \\), also \\( \\frac{1}{a^3} \\times \\frac{1}{a^2} = \\frac{1}{a^5} \\).\n612\n\nALGEBRA.\n\nInvolution.\n\n\\[ \\frac{r}{x} \\text{ or } x^{-2} \\times x^{-3} = x^{-5} = \\frac{1}{x^5} \\text{ and } \\frac{1}{x^3} \\times x^3 = x^{-3} \\]\n\n\\[ x \\times x^3 = x^4 + 1 = x^5 = 1. \\]\n\n65. From this method of notation it appears, that any quantity may be taken from the denominator of a fraction, and placed in the numerator, by changing the sign of its exponent; and hence it follows, that every fraction may also be represented as an integer quantity. Thus \\( \\frac{a^3}{bc^3} \\) denotes the same thing as \\( \\frac{a^3b^{-1}}{c^3} \\) or as \\( a^3b^{-1}c^{-3} \\), also \\( \\frac{a^3}{(x-1)^3} \\) may be otherwise expressed thus, \\( a^3(x-1)^{-3} \\).\n\nOf Involution.\n\n66. Involution is the method of finding any power of any assigned quantity, whether it be simple or compound; hence its rules are easily derived from the operation of multiplication.\n\nCase 1. When the quantity is simple.\n\nRule. Multiply the exponents of the letters by the index of the power required, and raise the coefficient to the same power.\n\nNote. If the sign of the quantity be + all its powers will be positive; but if it be —, then all its powers whose exponents are even numbers are positive, and all its powers whose exponents are odd numbers are negative.\n\nEx. 1. Required the cube, or third power of \\( 2a^2x \\).\n\n\\[(2a^2x)^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2a^2x^3 = 8a^6x^3, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nEx. 2. Required the fifth power of \\( -3a^2x^3 \\).\n\n\\[-(-3a^2x^3)^5 = -243a^{10}x^{15}, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nEx. 3. Required the fourth power of \\( \\frac{-2ax^4}{3b^2y} \\).\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{-2ax^4}{3b^2y}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16a^4x^8}{81b^8y^4}, \\text{ the answer.}\\]\n\nCase 2. When the quantity is compound.\n\nRule. The powers must be found by a continual multiplication of the quantity by itself.\n\nEx. Required the first four powers of the binomial quantity \\( a+x \\).\n\n\\[ a+x \\text{ the root, or first power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^2+2ax+x^2 \\text{ the square, or second power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^3+3a^2x+3ax^2+x^3 \\text{ the cube, or third power} \\]\n\n\\[ a^4+4a^3x+6a^2x^2+4ax^3+x^4 \\text{ the fourth power.} \\]\n\nIf it be required to find the same powers of \\( a-x \\), it will be found, that\n\n\\[ a-x \\text{ is the root, or first power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^2-2ax+x^2 \\text{ the square, or second power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^3-3a^2x+3ax^2-x^3 \\text{ the cube, or third power;} \\]\n\n\\[ a^4-4a^3x+6a^2x^2-4ax^3+x^4 \\text{ the fourth power.} \\]\n\nHence it appears, that the powers of \\( a+x \\) differ from the powers of \\( a-x \\), only in this respect, that in the former the signs of the terms are all positive, but in the latter, they are positive and negative alternately.\n\n67. Besides the method of finding the powers of a compound quantity by multiplication, which we have just now explained, there is another, more general, as well as more expeditious, by which a quantity may be raised to any power whatever without the trouble of finding any of the inferior powers, namely, by means of what is commonly called the binomial theorem. This theorem may be expressed as follows. Let \\( a+x \\) be a binomial quantity, which is to be raised to any power denoted by the number \\( n \\), then \\((a+x)^n = a^n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-2}x^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^{n-3}x^3 + \\cdots \\)\n\nThis series will always terminate when \\( n \\) is any whole positive number, by reason of some one of the factors \\( n-1, n-2, \\ldots \\) becoming zero; but if \\( n \\) be either a negative, or fractional number, the series will consist of an infinite number of terms; as, however, we mean to treat in this section only of the powers of quantities when their exponents are whole positive numbers we shall make no farther remarks upon any other; we shall afterwards give a demonstration of the theorem, and show its application to fractional and negative powers in treating of infinite series. The \\( n \\)th power of \\( a-x \\) will not differ from the same power of \\( a+x \\) but in the signs of the terms which compose it, for it will stand thus: \\((a-x)^n = a^n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-2}x^2 + \\cdots \\)\n\nHere \\( n \\) the exponent of the power being 5, the first term \\( a^5 \\) of the general theorem will be equal to \\( a^5 \\), the second \\( na^{n-1}x = 5a^4x \\), the third \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^{n-3}x^3 = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{1 \\cdot 2} a^3x^3 = 10a^3x^3 \\), the fourth \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^{n-4}x^4 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^2x^4 = 30a^2x^4 \\), the fifth \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} a^{n-5}x^5 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} ax^5 = 60ax^5 \\), and the sixth and last \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} a^{n-6}x^6 = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} x^6 = 120x^6 \\); the remaining terms...\nEvolution of the general theorem all vanish, by reason of the factor \\( n - 5 = 0 \\) by which each of them is multiplied, so that we get \\((a + x)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4x + 10a^3x^2 + 10a^2x^3 + 5ax^4 + x^5\\).\n\nEx. 2. It is required to raise \\( 2d - \\frac{2}{3} \\) to the third power.\n\nIn this case \\( n = 3 \\), so that if we put \\( a = 2d \\) and \\( x = \\frac{2}{3} \\) we have the first term of the general theorem, or \\( a^n = 8d^3 \\), the second \\( \\frac{n}{1} a^{n-1} x = 3 \\times 4d^2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 6d^2x \\), the third \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} a^{n-2} x^2 = 3 \\times 2d \\times \\frac{2}{3} = 2d^2x^2 \\), and the fourth and last term \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3} a^{n-3} x^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\), and since the signs of the terms of any power of \\( a + x \\) are \\( + \\) and \\( - \\) alternately we have \\( \\left( 2d - \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = 8d^3 - 6d^2x + 2d^2x^2 - \\frac{2}{3}x^3 \\).\n\n68. If the quantity to be involved consists of more than two terms, as if \\( p + q + r \\) were to be raised to the 2nd power, put \\( p = a \\) and \\( q = b \\) then \\( (p + q + r)^2 = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = p^2 + 2pq + (q + r)^2 \\) but \\( 2pq = 2pq - 2pr \\), and by the general theorem \\( (q + r)^2 = q^2 + 2qr + r^2 \\), therefore, we get \\( (p + q + r)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + 2qr + r^2 \\); and by a similar method of procedure a quantity consisting of four or more terms may be raised to any power.\n\nOf Evolution.\n\n69. Evolution is the reverse of involution, or it is the method of finding the root of any quantity, whether simple or compound, which is considered as a power of that root; hence it follows that its operations, generally speaking, must be the reverse of those of involution.\n\n70. To denote that the root of any quantity is to be taken the sign \\( \\sqrt{} \\) (called the radical sign) is placed before it, and a small number placed over the sign to express the denomination of the root. Thus \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) denotes the square root of \\( a \\), \\( \\sqrt[3]{a} \\) its cube root, \\( \\sqrt[4]{a} \\) its fourth root, and in general, \\( \\sqrt[n]{a} \\) its \\( n \\)th root. The number placed over the radical sign is called the index or exponent of the root, and is usually omitted in expressing the square root, thus either \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) or \\( \\sqrt[2]{a} \\) denotes the square root of \\( a \\).\n\n71. Case 1. When roots of simple quantities are to be found.\n\nRule. Divide the exponents of the letters by the index of the root required, and prefix the root of the numeral coefficient, the result will be the root required.\n\nNote 1. The root of any positive quantity may be either positive or negative, if the index of the root be an even number; but if it be an odd number, the root can be positive only.\n\n2. The root of a negative quantity is also negative when the index of root is an odd number.\n\n3. But if the quantity be negative, and the index of the root even, then no root can be assigned.\n\nEx. 1. Required the square root of \\( 36a^2x^4 \\).\n\nHere the index of the root is 2, and the root of the coefficient 6, therefore \\( \\sqrt{36a^2x^4} = 6ax^2 \\) or \\( \\sqrt{36a^2x^4} = -6ax^2 \\); for either of these quantities, when multiplied by itself, produces \\( 36a^2x^4 \\); so that the root required is \\( \\pm 6ax^2 \\), where the sign \\( \\pm \\) denotes that the quantity to which it is prefixed may be considered either as positive or negative.\n\nEx. 2. Required the cube root of \\( 125a^6x^9 \\).\n\nHere the index of the root is 3, and the root of the coefficient 5, therefore \\( \\sqrt[3]{125a^6x^9} = 5a^2x^3 \\) the root required; and in like manner the cube root of \\( -125a^6x^9 \\) is found to be \\( -5a^2x^3 \\).\n\n72. If it be required to extract the square of \\( -a^2 \\), it will immediately appear that no root can be assigned; for it can neither be \\( +a^2 \\) nor \\( -a^2 \\), seeing that each of these quantities when squared produces \\( +a^4 \\), the root required is therefore said to be impossible, and may be expressed thus: \\( \\sqrt{-a^2} \\).\n\nThe root of a fraction is found by extracting that root out of both numerator and denominator. Thus the square root of \\( \\frac{4a^4}{9b^2y^6} \\) is \\( \\frac{2a^2}{3by^3} \\).\n\nCase 2. When the quantity of which the root is to be extracted is compound.\n\n73. I. To extract the square root.\n\nRange the terms of the quantity according the powers of the letters, as in division.\n\nFind the square root of the first term for the first part of the root sought, subtract its square from the given quantity, and divide the remainder by double the part already found, and the quotient is the second term of the root.\n\nAdd the second part to double the first, and multiply their sum by the second part, subtract the product from the remainder, and if nothing remain, the square root is obtained. But if there is a remainder, it must be divided by the double of the parts already found, and the quotient will give the third term of the root, and so on.\n\nEx. 1. Required the square root of \\( a^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\na^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\\\\n\\hline\na^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n2a + x \\\\\n\\times x \\\\\n\\hline\n2ax + x^2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nEx. 2. Required the square root of \\( x^4 - 2x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{16}x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& x^4 - 2x^3 + \\frac{3}{2}x^2 - \\frac{1}{16}x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n& \\times x - 2x^3 + x^2 \\\\\n& = 2x^3 - 2x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{1}{16}x \\\\\n& \\times \\frac{1}{4}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x + \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n& = \\ast \\ast \\ast\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n74. To understand the reason of the rule for finding the square root of a compound quantity, it is only necessary to involve any quantity, as \\( a + b + c \\) to the second power, and observe the composition of its square; for we have \\((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2ac + 2bc + c^2\\), but \\(2ab + b^2 = (2a + b)b\\) and \\(2ac + 2bc + c^2 = (2a + 2b + c)c\\); therefore,\n\n\\[\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + (2a + b)b + (2a + 2b + c)c\n\\]\n\nand from this expression the manner of deriving the rule is obvious.\n\nAs an illustration of the common rule for extracting the square root of any proposed number, we shall suppose that the root of 59049 is required.\n\nAccordingly we have \\((a + b + c)^2 = 59049\\), and from hence we are to find the values of \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= 200 \\times 200 = 40000 \\\\\nb^2 &= 40 \\\\\nc^2 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence 243 is the root required.\n\nThe same example when wrought by the common rule (see Arithmetic) will stand thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 &= 800000 \\\\\nb^3 &= 7 \\\\\nc^3 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n75.

To extract the cube root.\n\nRange the terms of the quantity according to the powers of some one of the letters.\n\nFind the root of the first term, for the first part of the root sought; subtract its cube from the whole quantity, and divide the remainder by 3 times the square of the part already found, and the quotient is the second part of the root.\n\nAdd together, 3 times the square of the part of the root already found, 3 times the product of that part and the second part of the root, and the square of the second part; multiply the sum by the second part, and subtract the product from the first remainder, and if nothing remain, the root is obtained; but if there is a remainder, it must be divided by 3 times the square of the sum of the parts already found, and the quotient is a third term of the root, and so on, till the whole root is obtained.\n\nEx. Required the cube root of \\( a^3 + 3a^2x + 3ax^2 + x^3 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 + 3a^2x + 3ax^2 + x^3 & \\text{the root required.} \\\\\n3a^2 + 3ax + x^2 & \\text{the root required.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n76. The reason of the preceding rule is evident from the composition of a cube, for if any quantity as \\(a + b + c\\) be raised to the third power we have \\((a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + 3a^2c + 3abc + 3b^2c + 3bc^2 + c^3\\), and by considering in what manner the terms \\(a, b\\) and \\(c\\) are developed from this expression for the cube of their sum, we also see the reason for the common rule for extracting the cube root in numbers. Let it be required to find the cube root of 13312053, where the root will evidently consist of three figures; let us suppose it to be represented by \\(a + b + c\\) and the operation for finding the numerical values of these quantities may stand as follows.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 &= 800000 \\\\\nb^3 &= 7 \\\\\nc^3 &= 3\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe operation as performed by the common rule (see Arithmetic) will stand thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c}\n13312053 \\\\\n8 \\\\\n\\hline\n12 \\\\\n18 \\\\\n9 \\\\\n\\hline\n1389 \\\\\n4167 \\\\\n\\hline\n1587 \\\\\n383 \\\\\n49 \\\\\n\\hline\n163579 \\\\\n1145053 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n77. III. To extract any other root.\n\nRule. Range the quantity, of which the root is to be found, according to the powers of its letters, and extract the root of the first term, and that shall be the first member of the root required.\n\nInvolving the first member of the root to a power less by unity than the number that denominates the root required, and multiply the power that arises by the number itself; divide the second term of the given quantity by the product, and the quotient shall give the second member of the root required.\n\nFind the remaining members of the root in the same manner by considering those already found as making one term.\n\nEx. Required the cube root of \\(x^6 + 6x^5 - 40x^3 + 96x - 64\\)\n\n\\[\n(x^3)^3 = x^6 + 6x^5 + 12x^4 + 8x^3\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(x^3 + 2x - 4)^3 = x^6 + 6x^5 - 40x^3 + 96x - 64\n\\]\n\nIn this example, the cube root of \\(x^6\\), or \\(x^2\\), is the first member of the root, and to find a second member the first is raised to the power next lower, or to the second power, and also multiplied by 3, the index of the root required; thus we get \\(3x^4\\) for a divisor, by which the second term \\(6x^5\\) being divided, we find \\(2x\\) for the second member of the root. We must now consider \\(x^4 + 2x\\) as forming one term; accordingly having subtracted its cube from the quantity, of which the root is sought, we have \\(-12x^4\\), &c.; for a new dividend; and having also raised \\(x^3 + 2x\\) to the second power, and multiplied the result by 3, we find \\(3x^4 + 2x\\), &c., for a divisor. As it is only the terms which contain the highest powers of the dividend and divisor that we have occasion for, the remaining terms are expressed by &c. Having divided \\(-12x^4\\) by \\(3x^4\\), we find \\(-4\\)\n\nfor the third term of the root; and because it appears that \\(x^3 + 2x - 4\\), when raised to the third power, gives a result the very same with the proposed power, we conclude \\(x^3 + 2x - 4\\) to be the root sought.\n\n78. In the preceding examples, the quantities whose roots were to be found have been all such as could have their roots expressed by a finite number of terms; but it will frequently happen, that the root cannot be otherwise assigned than by a series consisting of an infinite number of terms: the preceding rules, however, will serve to determine any number of terms of the series. Thus the square root of \\(a^3 + x^2\\) will be found to be \\(a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} - \\frac{5x^8}{128a^7} + \\ldots\\) and the cube root of \\(a^3 + x^3\\) will stand thus \\(a + \\frac{x^3}{3a} - \\frac{x^6}{9a^2} + \\frac{5x^9}{81a^3} - \\frac{10x^{12}}{243a^4} + \\ldots\\), &c. But as the extraction of roots in the form of series can be more easily performed by other methods, we shall refer the reader to Section 17, which treats of series, where this subject is again resumed.\n\nSect. IV. Of Surds.\n\n79. It has been already observed (71), that the root of any proposed quantity is found by dividing the exponent of the quantity by the index of the root; and the rule has been illustrated by suitable examples, in all which, however, the quotient expressing the exponent of the result is a whole number; but there may be cases in which the quotient is a fraction. Thus if the cube root of \\(a^2\\) were required, it might be expressed, agreeably to the method of notation already explained, either thus \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\), or thus \\(a^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\).\n\n80. Quantities which have fractional exponents are called surds, or imperfect powers, and are said to be irrational, in opposition to others with integral exponents which are called rational.\n\n81. Surds may be denoted by means of the radical sign, but it will often be more convenient to use the notation of fractional exponents; the following examples will show how they may be expressed either way.\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a} = a^{\\frac{1}{3}}, \\quad \\sqrt[4]{ab} = b^{\\frac{1}{4}}, \\quad \\sqrt[4]{a^3b^4} = a^{\\frac{3}{4}}b^{\\frac{4}{4}}, \\quad \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = (a^2 + b^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n(a^2 + b^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\quad \\sqrt{(a - b)^2} = (a - b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}, \\quad \\sqrt{ab} = (a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n\\]\n\n\\(a^{-\\frac{1}{2}}b^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\).\n\n82. The operations concerning surds depend on the following principle. If the numerator and denominator of a fractional exponent be either both multiplied, or both divided by the same quantity, the value of the power is the same. Thus \\(a^m = a^n\\). For let \\(a^m = b\\), then, raising both to the power \\(n\\), \\(a^m = b^n\\), and farther raising both to the power \\(c\\) we get \\(a^{mc} = b^{nc}\\); let the root \\(cn\\) be now taken and we find \\(a^{mc} = b^{nc}\\).\n\n83. Prob. I. To Reduce a Rational Quantity to the form of a Surd of any given denomination.\n\nRule. Reduce the exponent of the quantity to the form of a fraction of the same denomination as the given surd.\n\nEx. 1,\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(a^2\\) to the form of the cube root.\n\nHere the exponent 2 must be reduced to the form of a fraction having 3 for a denominator, which will be the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\); therefore \\(a^2 = a^{\\frac{6}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce 5 to the form of the cube root, and \\(3ab^4\\) to the form of the square root.\n\nFirst \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt[3]{5 \\times 5 \\times 5} = \\sqrt[3]{125}\\).\n\nAnd \\(3ab^4 = 3^{\\frac{3}{4}} a^{\\frac{3}{4}} b^{\\frac{3}{4}} = (3^3 a^3 b^3)^{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\sqrt[4]{9a^3b^3}\\).\n\n84. Prob. II. To Reduce Surds of different denominations to others of the same value, and of the same denominations.\n\nRule. Reduce the fractional exponents to others of the same value, and having the same common denominator.\n\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{b^2}\\), or \\(a^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(b^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\) to other equivalent surds of the same denomination.\n\nThe exponents \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), when reduced to a common denominator, are \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{4}{6}\\); therefore, the surds required are \\(a^{\\frac{3}{6}}\\) and \\(b^{\\frac{4}{6}}\\), or \\(\\sqrt[6]{a^3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[6]{b^4}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce \\(3^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\(2^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) to surds of the same denomination.\n\nThe new exponents are \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\), therefore we have \\(3^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\sqrt[6]{3^1} = \\sqrt[6]{27}\\), and \\(2^{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\sqrt[6]{2^2} = \\sqrt[6]{4}\\).\n\nAnd in the same way the surds \\(A^{\\frac{m}{n}}\\), \\(B^{\\frac{n}{m}}\\) are reduced to these two \\(\\sqrt{A^n}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{B^m}\\).\n\n35. Prob. III. To Reduce Surds to their most simple terms.\n\nRule. Resolve the surd into two factors, so that one of them may be a complete power, having its exponent divisible by the index of the surd. Extract the root of that power, and place it before the remaining quantities, with the proper radical sign between them.\n\nEx. 1. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{48}\\) to its most simple terms.\n\nThe number 48 may be resolved into the two factors 16 and 3, of which the first is a complete square; therefore \\(\\sqrt{48} = (4^2 \\times 3)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4 \\times 3^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Reduce \\(\\sqrt{98a^4x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{24a^3x + 40a^3x^3}\\), each to its most simple terms.\n\nFirst \\(\\sqrt{98a^4x} = (7^2 a^4 \\times 2x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 7a^2 \\times (2x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 7a^2 \\sqrt{2x}\\).\n\nAlso \\(\\sqrt{24a^3x + 40a^3x^3} = (2^3 a^3 (3x + 5x^3))^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2a \\sqrt{3x + 5x^3}\\).\n\n86. Prob. IV. To Add and Subtract Surds.\n\nRule. If the surds are of different denominations, reduce them to others of the same denomination, by prob. 2.; and then reduce them to their simplest terms by last problem. Then, if the surd part be the same in them all, annex it to the sum, or difference of the rational parts, with the sign of multiplication, and it will give the sum, or difference required. But if the surd part be not the same in all the quantities, they can only be added, or subtracted by placing the signs \\(+\\) or \\(-\\) between them.\n\nEx. 1. Required the sum of \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48}\\).\n\nBy prob. 3., we find \\(\\sqrt{27} = 3\\sqrt{3}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{48} = 4\\sqrt{3}\\), therefore \\(\\sqrt{27} + \\sqrt{48} = 3\\sqrt{3} + 4\\sqrt{3} = 7\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nEx. 2. Required the sum of \\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\) and \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\).\n\n\\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 3^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = 5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{5}{4} \\sqrt{2}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(3^{\\frac{3}{4}} + 5^{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{2} + \\frac{5}{4} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{8}{4} \\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Required the difference between \\(\\sqrt{80a^4x}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{20a^4x^3}\\).\n\n\\(\\sqrt{80a^4x} = (4^2 a^4 \\times 5x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 4a^2 \\sqrt{5x}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{20a^4x^3} = (2^2 a^4 x^3 \\times 5x)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2ax \\sqrt{5x}\\); therefore \\(\\sqrt{80a^4x} - \\sqrt{20a^4x^3} = (4a^2 - 2ax) \\sqrt{5x}\\).\n\n87. Prob. V. To Multiply and Divide Surds.\n\nRule. If they are surds of the same rational quantity, add and subtract their exponents.\n\nBut if they are surds of different rational quantities, let them be brought to others of the same denomination, by prob. 2. Then, by multiplying or dividing these rational quantities, their product, or quotient may be set under the common radical sign.\n\nNote. If the surds have any rational coefficients, their product or quotient must be prefixed.\n\nEx. 1. Required the product of \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3}\\).\n\n\\(\\sqrt[3]{a^2} \\times \\sqrt[3]{a^3} = a^{\\frac{2}{3}} \\times a^{\\frac{3}{3}} = a^{\\frac{5}{3}} = a^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\), Ans.\n\nEx. 2. Divide \\(\\sqrt{a^3 - b^3}\\) by \\(\\sqrt{a + b}\\).\n\nThese surds when reduced to the same denomination are \\((a^3 - b^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\) and \\((a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\). Hence \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a^3 - b^3}}{\\sqrt{a + b}} = \\left(\\frac{(a^3 - b^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{(a + b)^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{(a^3 - b^3)}{(a + b)^2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{(a + b)(a - b)}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Required the product of \\(5\\sqrt{8}\\) and \\(3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\n\\(5\\sqrt{8} \\times 3\\sqrt{5} = 5 \\times 3 \\times \\sqrt{8} \\times \\sqrt{5} = 15 \\times \\sqrt{40} = 15 \\times \\sqrt{4 \\times 10} = 30\\sqrt{10}\\).\n\nEx. 4. Divide \\(8\\sqrt{56}\\) by \\(4\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\\(\\frac{8\\sqrt{56}}{4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{56}}{2\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{28}\\).\nEx. 5. Required the product of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) and \\( x^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\), also the quotient arising from the division of \\( a^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) by \\( b^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\).\n\nFirst \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\times x^{\\frac{1}{n}} = x^{\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}} = x^{\\frac{m+n}{mn}} = \\sqrt[mn]{x^{m+n}} \\),\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{a^{\\frac{1}{m}}}{b^{\\frac{1}{n}}} = \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{mn}} = \\frac{mn}{\\sqrt{a^m b^n}} \\).\n\n88. Prob. VI. To Involve and Evolve Surds.\n\nSurds are involved or evolved in the same manner as any other quantities, namely, by multiplying or dividing their exponents by the index of the power, or root required. Thus the square of \\( 3^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\) is \\( 3 \\times 3 \\times (3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 9 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{9} \\). The \\( n \\)th power of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) is \\( x^{\\frac{n}{m}} \\). The cube root of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} \\) is \\( \\frac{6}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{2} \\) and the \\( n \\)th root of \\( x^{\\frac{1}{m}} \\) is \\( x^{\\frac{n}{m}} \\).\n\n89. If a compound quantity involve one or more surds, its powers may be found by multiplication. Thus the square of \\( 3 + \\sqrt{5} \\) is found as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3 + \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n3 + \\sqrt{5} \\\\\n9 + 3\\sqrt{5} \\\\\n+ 3\\sqrt{5} + 5 \\\\\n9 + 6\\sqrt{5} + 5 = 14 + 6\\sqrt{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthe square required.\n\n90. The square root of a binomial, or residual surd \\( A+B \\), or \\( A-B \\) may be found thus. Take \\( \\sqrt{A^2 - B^2} = D \\);\n\nthen \\( \\sqrt{A+B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A+D}{2}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{A-D}{2}} \\),\n\nand \\( \\sqrt{A-B} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A+D}{2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{A-D}{2}} \\).\n\nThus the square root of \\( 8 + 2\\sqrt{7} \\) is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{7} \\); and the square root of \\( 3 - \\sqrt{8} \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} - 1 \\). With respect to the extraction of the cube or any higher root no general rule can be given.\n\nSect. V. Of Proportion.\n\n91. In comparing together any two quantities of the same kind in respect of magnitude, we may consider how much the one is greater than the other, or else how many times the one contains either the whole, or some part of the other; or which is the same thing, we may consider either what is the difference between the quantities, or what is the quotient arising from the division of the one quantity by the other; the former of these is called their arithmetical ratio, and the latter their geometrical ratio. These denominations, however, have been assumed arbitrarily, and have little or no connexion with the relations they are intended to express.\n\nI. Of Arithmetical Proportion.\n\n92. When of four quantities the difference between the first and second is equal to the difference between the third and fourth, the quantities are called arithmetical proportions. Such, for example, are the numbers 2, 5, 9, 12; and, in general, the quantities \\( a, a+d, b, b+d \\). If the two middle terms are equal, the quantities constitute what are called three arithmetical proportions.\n\n93. The most material property of four arithmetical proportions is the following: If four quantities be arithmetically proportional, the sum of the extreme terms is equal to the sum of the means. Let the quantities be \\( a, a+d, b, b+d \\), where \\( d \\) is the difference between the first and second, and also between the third and fourth, the sum of the extremes is \\( a+b+d \\), and that of the means \\( a+d+b \\); so that the truth of the proportion is evident. Hence it follows, that if any three quantities be arithmetically proportional, the sum of the two extremes is double the mean.\n\n94. If any three terms of four arithmetical proportions be given, the fourth may be found from the preceding proposition. Let \\( a, b, c \\), be the first, second, and fourth terms, and let \\( x \\) the third term be required; because \\( a+c=b+x \\); therefore \\( x=a+c-b \\).\n\nIn like manner any two of three arithmetical proportions being supposed given, the remaining term may be readily found.\n\n95. If a series of quantities be such, that the difference between any two adjacent terms is always the same, these terms form a continued arithmetical proportion. Thus the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. form a series in continued arithmetical proportion, and, in general, such a series may be represented thus:\n\n\\( a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, a+5d, a+6d, \\&c. \\)\n\nwhere \\( a \\) denotes the first term, and \\( d \\) the common difference.\n\nBy a little attention to this series, we readily discover that it has the following properties:\n\n1. The last term of the series is equal to the first term, together with the common difference taken as often as there are terms after the first. Thus, when the number of terms is 7, the last term is \\( a+6d \\); and so on. Hence if \\( x \\) denote the last term, \\( n \\) the number of terms, and \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) express the first term, and common difference, we have \\( x=a+(n-1)d \\).\n\n2. The sum of the first and last term is equal to the sum of any two terms at the same distance from them. Thus suppose the number of terms to be 7, then the last term is \\( a+6d \\), and the sum of the first and last, \\( 2a+6d \\); but the same is also the sum of the second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and so on till we come to the middle term, which, because it is equally distant from the extremes, must be added to itself.\n\n96. From this last mentioned property we derive a rule for finding the sum of all the terms of the series. For if the sum of the first and last be taken, as also the sum of the second and last but one, of the third and last but two, and so on along the series till we come to the sum of the last and first terms, it is evident that we shall have as many sums as there are terms, and each equal to the sum of the first and last terms; but the aggregate of those sums is equal to all the terms of the series taken twice, therefore the sum of the first and last term, taken as often as there are terms, is equal to twice the sum of all the terms, so that if \\( s \\) denote that sum, we have \\( 2s=n(a+x) \\), and \\( s=\\frac{n}{2}(a+x) \\).\nHence the sum of the odd numbers \\(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \\ldots\\) continued to \\(n\\) terms, is equal to the square of the number of terms. For in this case \\(a = 1\\), \\(d = 2\\), \\(s = 1 + (n-1)d = 2n - 1\\), therefore \\(s = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 2n = n^2\\).\n\nII. Of Geometrical Proportion.\n\n97. When of four quantities, the quotient arising from the division of the first by the second is equal to that arising from the division of the third by the fourth, these quantities are said to be in geometrical proportion, or are called simply proportional. Thus \\(1, 2, 4, 8, \\ldots\\) are four numbers in geometrical proportion; and in general, \\(na, a, nb, b\\) may express any four proportions, for \\(\\frac{na}{a} = n\\), and also \\(\\frac{nb}{b} = n\\).\n\n98. To denote that any four quantities \\(a, b, c, d\\), are proportional, it is common to place them thus, \\(a : b :: c : d\\), or thus \\(a : b = c : d\\), which notation, when expressed in words, is read thus, \\(a\\) is to \\(b\\) as \\(c\\) to \\(d\\), or the ratio of \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) is equal to the ratio of \\(c\\) to \\(d\\).\n\nThe first and third terms of a proportion are called the antecedents, and the second and fourth, the consequents.\n\n99. When the two middle terms of a proportion are the same, the remaining terms, and that quantity, constitute three geometrical proportions; such are \\(4, 6, 9\\), and in general \\(na, a, \\frac{a}{n}\\). In this case the middle quantity is called a mean proportional between the other two.\n\n100. The principal properties of four proportional are the following:\n\n1. If four quantities be proportional, the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Let \\(a, b, c, d\\) be four quantities, such that \\(a : b :: c : d\\); then from the nature of proportions \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\); let these equal quotients be multiplied by \\(bd\\), and we have \\(\\frac{abd}{b} = \\frac{cbd}{d}\\), or \\(ad = bc\\). Hence it follows that when three quantities are proportional, the product of the extremes is equal to the square of the middle term. It also appears, that if any three of four proportional be given, the remaining one may be found. Thus let \\(a, b, c\\), the three first be given, and let it be required to find \\(x\\) the fourth term; because \\(a : b :: c : x\\), \\(ax = bc\\), and dividing by \\(a\\), \\(x = \\frac{bc}{a}\\). This conclusion may be considered as a demonstration of what is called the rule of three in arithmetic.\n\n2. If four quantities be such that the product of two of them is equal to the product of the other two, these quantities are proportional.\n\nLet \\(a, b, c, d\\) be the quantities, which are such that \\(ad = bc\\), if these equals be divided by \\(bd\\), we get \\(\\frac{ad}{bd} = \\frac{bc}{bd}\\) or \\(\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{c}{d}\\) hence it follows, from the definition given of proportions, (\\$97.) that \\(a : b :: c : d\\). From Geometric this property of proportions it appears, that if three cal Proportion quantities be such that the square of one of them be equal to the product of the other two, these quantities are three proportional.\n\n101. If four quantities are proportional, that is, if \\(a : b :: c : d\\), then will each of the following combinations or arrangements of the quantities be also four proportional.\n\n1st, By inversion \\(b : a :: d : c\\)\n2nd, By alternation \\(a : c :: b : d\\)\n3rd, By composition \\(a + b : a + c :: d + c\\)\nor \\(a + b : b :: c + d : d\\)\n4th, By division \\(a - b : a :: c - d : d\\)\nor \\(a - b : b :: c - d : d\\)\n5th, By mixing \\(a + b : a - b :: c + d : c - d\\)\n6th, By taking any equimultiples of the antecedents, and also any equimultiples of the consequents \\(na : pb :: nc : pd\\)\n7th, Or by taking any parts of the antecedents and consequents \\(\\frac{a}{n} : \\frac{b}{p} :: \\frac{c}{n} : \\frac{d}{p}\\)\n\nThat the preceding combinations of the quantities \\(a, b, c, d\\) are proportional, may be readily proved, by taking the products of the extremes and means; for from each of them we derive this conclusion, that \\(ad = bc\\), which is known to be true, from the original assumption of the quantities.\n\n102. If four quantities be proportional, and also other four, the product of the corresponding terms will be proportional.\n\nLet \\(a : b :: c : d\\),\nand \\(e : f :: g : h\\),\nThen \\(ae : bf :: cg : dh\\).\n\nFor \\(ad = bc\\) and \\(eh = fg\\) (\\$100.), therefore, multiplying together these equal quantities \\(ad \\cdot eh = bc \\cdot fg\\), or \\(ae \\cdot db = bf \\cdot cg\\), therefore by the second property (\\$100.), \\(ae : bf :: cg : dh\\).\n\n103. Hence it follows, that if there be any number of proportions whatever, the products of the corresponding terms will still be proportional.\n\n104. If a series of quantities be so related to each other, that the quotient arising from the division of any term by that which follows it is always the same quantity, these quantities are said to be in continued geometrical proportion, such as the numbers \\(2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \\ldots\\) &c. also \\(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\ldots\\) &c., and in general a series of such quantities may be represented thus, \\(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, ar^5, \\ldots\\) &c. Here \\(a\\) is the first term, and \\(r\\) the quotient of any two adjoining terms, which is also called the common ratio.\n\n105. By inspecting this series we find that it has the following properties:\n\n1. The last term is equal to the first, multiplied by the common ratio raised to a power, the index of which is one less than the number of terms. Therefore if \\(z\\) denote the last term, and \\(n\\) the number of terms, \\(z = ar^{n-1}\\).\n\n---\n\n* The quantities in this case must be all of the same kind, that is, if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote surfaces, then \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) must also denote surfaces, but they cannot represent lines, &c.\n2. The product of the first and last term is equal to the product of any two terms equally distant from them; thus, supposing \\( ar^5 \\) the last term, it is evident that \\( a \\times ar^5 = ar \\times ar^4 = ar^2 \\times ar^3 \\), &c.\n\n106. The sum of all the terms may be found thus: let \\( s \\) represent that sum, then, supposing the number of terms to be fixed, \\( s = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 \\), and multiplying these equals by \\( r \\), \\( sr = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ar^4 + ar^5 + ar^6 \\). If from the lower line, or \\( sr = ar + ar^2 + \\ldots + ar^5 \\), we subtract the upper line, or \\( s = a + ar + \\ldots + ar^5 \\), the remainders will evidently be equal; but on the one side of the sum we have \\( sr - s = ar^6 - a \\); and on the other \\( ar^6 - a \\); therefore, \\( sr - s = ar^6 - a \\).\n\nand dividing by \\( r - 1 \\), \\( s = \\frac{ar^n - a}{r - 1} \\). Let us now, instead of 6, substitute \\( n \\) (for the number of terms put down was 6), and we have the following general rule for finding the sum of a series of quantities in continued geometrical proportion, \\( s = \\frac{ar^n - a}{r - 1} \\), or \\( s = \\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \\).\n\nSect. VI. Of the Reduction of Equations involving one unknown quantity.\n\n107. The general object of algebraic investigation is to discover certain unknown quantities, by comparing them with other quantities which are given, or supposed to be known. The relation between the known and unknown quantities is either that of equality, or else such as may be reduced to equality; and a proposition which affirms that certain combinations of quantities are equal to one another is called an equation. Such are the following, \\( \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{24}{x} \\), \\( 2x + 3y = xy \\); the first of these equations expresses the relation between an unknown quantity \\( x \\), and certain known numbers; and the second expresses the relation which the two indefinite quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have to each other.\n\n108. When a quantity stands alone on one side of an equation, the terms on the other side are said to be a value of that quantity. Thus in the equation \\( x = ax + bx - c \\), the quantity \\( x \\) stands alone on one side, and \\( ax + bx - c \\) is its value.\n\n109. The conditions of a problem may be such as to require several equations and symbols of unknown quantities for their complete expression; these, however, by rules hereafter to be explained, may be reduced to one equation, involving only one unknown quantity and its powers, besides the known quantities; and the method of expressing that quantity, by means of the known quantities, constitutes the theory of equations, one of the most important, as well as most intricate branches of algebraic analysis.\n\n110. An equation is said to be resolved, when the unknown quantity is made to stand alone on one side, and only known quantities on the other side; and the value of the unknown quantity is called a root of the equation.\n\n111. Equations containing only one unknown quantity and its powers, are divided into different orders, according to the highest power of that quantity contained in any one of its terms. The equation, however, is supposed to be reduced to such a form, that the unknown quantity is found only in the numerators of the terms, and that the exponents of its powers are expressed by positive integers.\n\n112. If an equation contains only the first power of the unknown quantity, it is called a simple equation, or an equation of the first order. Such is \\( ax + bx = c \\), where \\( x \\) denotes an unknown, and \\( a, b, c \\) known quantities.\n\n113. If the equation contains the second power of the unknown quantity, it is said to be of the second degree, or is called a quadratic equation; such is \\( 4x^2 + 3x = 12 \\), and in general \\( ax^2 + bx = c \\). If it contains the third power of the unknown quantity, it is of the third degree, or is a cubic equation. Such are \\( x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x = 10 \\), and \\( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx = d \\), and so on, with respect to equations of the higher orders. A simple equation is sometimes said to be linear, or to be of one dimension. In like manner, quadratic equations are said to be equations of two dimensions, and cubic equations to be of three dimensions.\n\n114. When in the course of an algebraic investigation we arrive at an equation involving only one unknown quantity, that quantity will often be so entangled in the different terms, as to render several previous reductions necessary before the equation can be expressed under its characteristic form, so as to be resolved by the rules which belong to that form.\n\nThese reductions depend upon the operations which have been explained in the former part of this treatise, and the application of a few self-evident principles, namely, that if equal quantities be added to, or subtracted from equal quantities, the sums or remainders will be equal; if equal quantities be multiplied, or divided by the same quantity, the products or quotients will be equal; and, lastly, if equal quantities be raised to the same power, or have the same root extracted out of each, the results will still be equal.\n\nFrom these considerations are derived the following rules, which apply alike to equations of all orders, and are alone sufficient for the resolution of simple equations.\n\n115. Rule 1. Any quantity may be transposed from one side of an equation to the other, by changing its signs.\n\nThus, if \\( x - 3 = 5 \\)\nThen \\( x = 5 + 3 \\)\nOr \\( x = 8 \\)\n\nAnd if \\( 3x - 10 = 2x + 5 \\)\nThen \\( 3x - 2x = 5 + 10 \\)\nOr \\( x = 15 \\)\n\nAgain, if \\( ax + bx = cx - dx + e \\)\nThen \\( ax - cx + dx = e - b \\)\nOr \\( (a - c + d)x = e - b \\)\n\nThe reason of this rule is evident, for the transposing a quantity from one side of an equation to the other is nothing more than adding the same quantity to each side of the equation, if the sign of the quantity transposed was \\(-\\); or subtracting it, if the sign was \\(+\\).\n\nFrom this rule we may infer, that if any quantity be found on each side of the equation with the same sign, it may be left out of both. Also, that the signs of all the terms of an equation may be changed into\nReduction the contrary without affecting the truth of the equation.\n\nThus, if \\(a + x = b + a - c\\)\nThen \\(x = b + c\\)\nAnd if \\(a - x = b - d\\)\nThen \\(x = a - d - b\\)\n\n116. Rule 2. If the unknown quantity in an equation be multiplied by any quantity, that quantity may be taken away, by dividing all the other terms of the equation by it.\n\nIf \\(3x = 24\\)\nThen \\(x = \\frac{24}{3} = 8\\)\nIf \\(ax = b - c\\)\nThen \\(x = \\frac{b - c}{a}\\)\n\nHere equal quantities are divided by the same quantity, and therefore the quotients are equal.\n\n117. Rule 3. If any term of an equation be a fraction, its denominator may be taken away by multiplying all the other terms of the equation by that denominator.\n\nIf \\(x = \\frac{7}{5}\\)\nThen \\(x = 35\\)\nIf \\(x = \\frac{b - c + d}{a}\\)\nThen \\(x = ab - ac + ad\\)\nIf \\(a = b = c\\),\n\\(ax = bx\\).\n\nIn these examples, equal quantities are multiplied by the same quantity, and therefore the products are equal.\n\n118. The denominators may be taken away from several terms of an equation by one operation, if we multiply all the terms by any number which is a multiple of each of these denominators.\n\nThus, if \\(\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{x}{4} = 26\\).\n\nLet all the terms be multiplied by 12, which is a multiple of 2, 3, and 4, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{12x}{2} + \\frac{12x}{3} + \\frac{12x}{4} = 312\n\\]\n\nOr \\(6x + 4x + 3x = 312\\)\nHence \\(13x = 312\\)\n\nUniversally, if \\(\\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{x}{b} + \\frac{x}{c} = d - e\\).\n\nTo take away the denominators \\(a, b, c\\), let the whole equation be multiplied by \\(abc\\), their product, and we have\n\n\\[bcx - acx + abx = abc(d - e)\\]\nOr \\((bc - ac + ab)x = abc(d - e)\\);\n\n119. From the two last rules it appears that if all the terms of an equation be either multiplied or divided by the same quantity, that quantity may be left out of all the terms.\n\nIf \\(ax = ab - ac\\)\nThen \\(x = b - c\\)\nAnd if \\(\\frac{x}{a} = \\frac{b}{a} + \\frac{c}{a}\\)\nThen \\(x = b + c\\).\n\n120. Rule. If the unknown quantity is found in any term which is a furd, let that furd be made to stand alone on one side of the equation, and the remaining terms on the opposite side; then involve each side to a power denoted by the index of the furd, and thus the unknown quantity shall be freed from the furd expression.\n\nIf \\(\\sqrt{x} + 6 = 10\\)\nThen by transposition \\(\\sqrt{x} = 10 - 6 = 4\\)\nAnd squaring both sides \\(\\sqrt{x} \\times \\sqrt{x} = 4 \\times 4\\)\nOr \\(x = 16\\).\n\nAlso, if \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = b + x\\)\nBy trans. \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = b + x\\)\nAnd squaring, \\(a^2 + x^2 = (b + x)^2 = b^2 + 2bx + x^2\\)\nHence \\(a^2 = b^2 + 2bx\\).\n\nAnd if \\(\\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = a\\)\nThen \\(a^2 - b^2 = a^2\\).\n\n121. Rule 5. If the side of the equation, which contains the unknown quantity, be a perfect power, the equation may be reduced to another of a lower order, by extracting the root of that power out of each side of the equation.\n\nThus if \\(x^3 = 64a^3\\)\nThen, by extracting the cube root, \\(x = 8a\\)\nAnd if \\((a + x)^3 = b^3 - a^3\\)\nThen \\(a + x = \\sqrt[3]{b^3 - a^3}\\).\n\n122. The use of the preceding rules will be farther illustrated by the following examples:\n\nEx. 1. Let \\(2c - 3x = 60 - 7x\\)\nBy rule 1,\n\\(7x - 3x = 60 + 8 - 2x\\)\nOr \\(4x = 48\\)\nTherefore by rule 2, \\(x = 12\\).\n\nEx. 2. Let \\(ax - bx = cx + d\\)\nBy rule 1,\n\\(ax - cx = bx + d\\)\nOr \\((a - c)x = b + d\\)\nAnd by rule 2, \\(x = \\frac{b + d}{a - c}\\).\n\nEx. 3. Let \\(\\frac{x + 1}{2} + \\frac{x + 2}{3} = 16 - \\frac{x + 3}{4}\\)\nBy rule 3,\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx + 1 + 2x + 4 &= 32 - 2x + 6 \\\\\n3x + 3 + 2x + 4 &= 96 - 6x + 18 \\\\\n12x + 12 + 8x + 16 &= 384 - 6x - 18 \\\\\n20x + 28 &= 366 - 6x\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOr \\(26x = 338\\)\nHence, by rule 1, \\(26x = 338\\)\nAnd by rule 2, \\(x = 13\\).\n\nIn this example, instead of taking away the denominators one after another, they might have been all taken away at once, by multiplying the given equation by\nReduction by 12, which is divisible by the numbers 2, 3, and 4; thus we should have got $6x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 8 = 192 - 3x - 9$, and hence, as before, $x = 1$.\n\nEx. 4. Let $6x^3 - 20x^2 = 16x^2 + 2x^3$\n\nThen dividing by $2x^2$, $3x - 10 = 8 + x$\nAnd transposing, $3x - x = 8 + 10$\nOr $2x = 18$\nAnd therefore $x = 9$.\n\nEx. 5. Let $\\frac{b^2}{x} = c$\n\nThen $ax - b^2 = cx$\nAnd $ax - cx = b^2$\nWhence $x = \\frac{b^2}{a - c}$.\n\nEx. 6. Let $x - 6 = \\frac{x^2}{x + 24}$\n\nThen $(x - 6)(x + 24) = x^2$\nThat is $x^2 + 18x - 144 = x^2$\nTherefore $18x = 144$\nAnd $x = 8$.\n\nEx. 7. Let $ax + b^2 = \\frac{ax^2 + ac^2}{a + x}$\n\nThen $(a + x)(ax + b^2) = ax^2 + ac^2$\nOr $a^2x + ab^2 + ax^2 + b^2x = ax^2 + ac^2$\nHence $a^2x + b^2x = ac^2 - ab^2$\nAnd $x = \\frac{ac^2 - ab^2}{a^2 + b^2}$.\n\nEx. 8. Let $\\frac{1 - x}{1 + x} = a$\n\nThen $1 - x = a + ax$\nAnd $-x = ax = a - 1$\nOr changing the signs, $x + ax = 1 - a$\nHence, $x = \\frac{1 - a}{1 + a}$.\n\nEx. 9. Let $\\sqrt{12 + x} = 2 + \\sqrt{x}$\n\nThen by rule 4, $12 + x = 4 + 4\\sqrt{x} + x$\nAnd by transposition $8 = 4\\sqrt{x}$\nAnd by division $2 = \\sqrt{x}$\nAnd again by rule 4, $4 = x$.\n\nEx. 10. Let $x + \\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = \\frac{2a}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}$\n\nThen, by rule 3, $x\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} + a^2 + x^2 = 2a^2$\nAnd by transposition, &c., $x\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = a^2 - x^2$\nTherefore, by rule 4, $a^2x^2 + x^4 = a^4 - 2a^2x^2 + x^4$\nWhence $3a^2x^2 = a^4$\nAnd $x^2 = \\frac{a^2}{3}$, therefore, rule 5, $x = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nEx. 11. Let $\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = a$\n\nThen $1 - \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = a + a\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nAnd $1 - a = a\\sqrt{1 - x^2} + \\sqrt{1 - x^2} = (1 + a)\\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nWhence $\\frac{1 - a}{1 + a} = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$\n\nAnd, taking the square of both sides, $\\frac{(1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2} = 1 - x^2$\n\nTherefore, by transposition, $x^2 = 1 - \\frac{(1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2}$\n\nThat is, $x^2 = \\frac{(1 + a)^2 - (1 - a)^2}{(1 + a)^2} = \\frac{4a}{(1 + a)^2}$\n\nTherefore $x = \\frac{2\\sqrt{a}}{1 + a}$.\n\nEx. 12. Let $a + x = \\sqrt{a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}}$\n\nThen $(a + x)^2 = a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nThat is, $a^2 + 2ax + x^2 = a^2 + x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nTherefore $2ax + x^2 = x\\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nAnd dividing by $x$, $2a + x = \\sqrt{b^2 + x^2}$\nAgain taking the squares of both sides, $4a^2 + 4ax + x^2 = b^2 + x^2$\nWhence $4a^2 + 4ax = b^2$\nAnd $4ax = b^2 - 4a^2$; so that $x = \\frac{b^2 - 4a^2}{4a}$.\n\n123. In all these examples we have been able to determine the value of the unknown quantity by the rules already delivered, because in every case the first, or at most the second power of that quantity, has been made to stand alone on one side of the equation, while the other consisted only of known quantities; but the same methods of reduction serve to bring equations of all degrees to a proper form for solution. Thus if $\\frac{1 - p + q + r}{x + 1} = 1 - p - x + r$, by proper reduction, we have $x^3 + px^2 + qx = r$, a cubic equation, which may be resolved by rules to be afterwards explained.\n\nSect. VII. Of the Reduction of Equations involving more than one unknown quantity.\n\n124. Having shown in the last section in what manner an equation involving one unknown quantity may be resolved, or at least fitted for a final solution, we are next to explain the methods by which two or more equations, involving as many unknown quantities, may at last be reduced to one equation, and one unknown quantity.\n\nAs the unknown quantities may be combined together in very different ways, so as to constitute an equation, the methods most proper for their extermination must therefore be various. The three following, however, are of general application, and the last of them may be used with advantage, not only when the unknown quantity to be exterminated arises to the same power in all the equations, but also when the equations contain different powers of that quantity.\n\n125. Method 1. Observe which of the unknown quantities is the least involved, and let its value be found from each equation by the rules of last section.\n\nLet the values thus found be put equal to each other, and hence new equations will arise, from which\nALGEBRA.\n\nReduction that quantity is wholly excluded. Let the same operation be now repeated with the new equations, and the unknown quantities exterminated one by one, till at last an equation be found, which contains only one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let it be required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from these two equations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x &= 23 - 3y \\\\\nx &= \\frac{23 - 3y}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5x &= 10 + 2y \\\\\nx &= \\frac{10 + 2y}{5}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) be now put equal to each other.\n\nAnd we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{10 + 2y}{5} &= \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\\\\n2(10 + 2y) &= 5(23 - 3y) \\\\\n20 + 4y &= 115 - 15y \\\\\n19y &= 95 \\\\\ny &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd since \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\), or \\( x = \\frac{10 + 2y}{5} \\), from either of these values we find \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n126. Method 2. Let the value of the unknown quantity, which is to be exterminated, be found from that equation wherein it is last involved. Let this value, and its powers, be substituted for that quantity, and its respective powers in the other equations; and with the new equations thus arising, let the operation be repeated, till there remain only one equation, and one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let the given equations, as in last method, be\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} \\)\n\nAnd this value of \\( x \\) being substituted in the second equation, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n5 \\times \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} - 2y &= 10 \\\\\n115 - 15y - 4y &= 20 \\\\\n95 &= 19y \\\\\ny &= 5\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd hence \\( x = \\frac{23 - 3y}{2} = 4 \\), as before.\n\n127. Method 3. Let the given equations be multiplied or divided by such numbers or quantities, whether known or unknown, that the term which involves the highest power of the unknown quantity may be the same in each equation.\n\nThen by adding or subtracting the equations, as occasion may require, that term will vanish, and a new equation emerge, wherein the number of dimensions of the unknown quantity in some cases, and in others the number of unknown quantities, will be diminished; and by a repetition of the same, or similar operations, a final equation may be at last obtained, involving only one unknown quantity.\n\nEx. Let the same example be taken, as in the illustration of the two former methods, namely,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2x + 3y &= 23 \\\\\n5x - 2y &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand from these two equations we are to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). To exterminate \\( x \\), let the first equation be multiplied by 5, and the second by 2, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10x + 15y &= 115 \\\\\n10x - 4y &= 20\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the term involving \\( x \\) is the same in both equations, and it is obvious that by subtracting the one from the other, the resulting equation will contain only \\( y \\), and known numbers, for by such subtraction we find \\( 19y = 95 \\), and therefore \\( y = 5 \\).\n\nHaving got the value of \\( y \\), it is easy to see how \\( x \\) may be found, from either of the given equations; but it may also be found in the same manner as we found \\( y \\).\n\nFor let the first of the given equations be multiplied by 2, and the second by 3, and we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4x + 6y &= 46 \\\\\n15x - 6y &= 30\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBy adding these equations, we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n19x &= 76 \\\\\nx &= 4\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand therefore \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n128. The following examples will serve farther to illustrate these different methods of exterminating the unknown quantities from equations.\n\nEx. 1. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} &= 16 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{5} - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nRequired \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nBy Method 1.\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\( x = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\)\n\nAnd from the second \\( x = 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\)\n\nOr \\( 90 + 5y = 288 - 6y \\)\n\nHence \\( 11y = 198 \\)\n\nAnd \\( y = 18 \\)\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) being substituted in either of the values of \\( x \\), namely, \\( 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\) or \\( 10 + \\frac{5y}{9} \\) we find \\( x = 20 \\).\n\nBy Method 2.\n\nHaving found from the first given equation \\( x = 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\), let this value of \\( x \\) be substituted in the second, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{5} \\left( 32 - \\frac{2y}{3} \\right) - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n\\frac{32}{5} - \\frac{2y}{15} - \\frac{y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n\\frac{198}{15} - \\frac{11y}{9} &= 2 \\\\\n18 &= y\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThe value of \\( y \\) being now substituted in either of the given equations, we thence find \\( x = 20 \\) as before.\n\nBy Method 3.\n\nThe denominators of the two given equations being taken away by rule 3. of last section, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3x + 2y &= 96 \\\\\n9x - 5y &= 90\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nFrom three times the first of these equations, or \\( 9x + 6y = 288 \\), let the second be subtracted, and there remains\n\n\\[\n11y = 198\n\\]\n\nAnd hence \\( y = 18 \\)\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) being now substituted in either of the equations \\( 3x + 2y = 96 \\), \\( 9x - 5y = 90 \\), we readily find \\( x = 20 \\).\n\n129. Having now shewn in what manner the different methods of exterminating the unknown quantities may be applied, we shall, in the remaining examples of this section, chiefly make use of the last method, because it is the most easy and expeditious in practice.\n\nEx. 2. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} - 12 &= \\frac{y}{4} + 8 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{5} + \\frac{y}{3} - 8 &= \\frac{2y}{4} + 27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIt is required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( 4x - 96 = 2y + 64 \\).\nAnd from the second, \\( 12x + 12y + 20x - 48c = 3c9 \\)\n\\(-15x + 1620\\).\n\nThese two equations when abridged become\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n4x - 2y &= 160 \\\\\n47x - 18y &= 2100\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( y \\); from this last equation let 9 times the one preceding it be subtracted.\n\nThus we find \\( 11x = 660 \\)\nAnd \\( x = 60 \\)\nAnd because \\( 2y = 4x - 160 = 80 \\)\nTherefore \\( y = 40 \\).\n\nEx. 3. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nax + by &= c \\\\\ndx + fy &= g\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( y \\), let the first equation be multiplied by \\( f \\) and the second by \\( b \\); and we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nafx + bfy &= cf \\\\\nbdx + bfy &= bg\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTaking now the difference between these equations we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nafx - bdx &= cf - bg \\\\\n(cf - bg) &= af - bd\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd therefore \\( x = \\frac{cf - bg}{af - bd} \\).\n\nIn the same manner may \\( y \\) be determined, by multiplying the first of the given equations by \\( d \\), and the second by \\( a \\); for we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nadx + bdy &= cd \\\\\nadx + aby &= ag\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand taking the difference as before, we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nbdy - aby &= cd - ag \\\\\ncd - ag &= bd - af\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd therefore \\( y = \\frac{bd - af}{cd - ag} \\).\n\nThis last example may be considered as a general solution of the following problem. Two equations expressing the relation between the first powers of two unknown quantities being given, to determine those quantities. For whatever be the number of terms in each equation, it will readily appear, as in example 2d, that by proper reduction, they may be brought to the same form as those given in the 3d example.\n\n130. Let us next consider such equations as involve three unknown quantities.\n\nEx. 4. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 29 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\nWe shall in this example proceed according to the rules of the first method for exterminating the unknown quantities.\n\nFrom the first equation \\( x = 29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\)\nFrom the second \\( x = 62 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\)\nFrom the third \\( x = 20 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\).\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) be put equal to each other, thus we get the two following equations.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} \\\\\n29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} &= 20 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAgain, from these two equations, by transposition, &c., we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} \\\\\ny &= 27 - \\frac{3z}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} = 27 - \\frac{3z}{2} \\)\n\nAnd hence, by reduction \\( z = 12 \\)\nWhence also \\( y = 33 - \\frac{3z}{2} = 9 \\)\nAnd \\( x = 29 - \\frac{y}{3} - \\frac{z}{4} = 8 \\).\n\nEx. 5. Given\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{3} + \\frac{z}{4} &= 62 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{y}{4} + \\frac{z}{5} &= 47 \\\\\n\\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{y}{5} + \\frac{z}{6} &= 38\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\).\n\nHere the given equations, when cleared from fractions, become\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n12x + 8y + 6z &= 1488 \\\\\n20x + 15y + 12z &= 2820 \\\\\n30x + 24y + 20z &= 4560\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\( z \\) by the third method, let the first equation be multiplied by 10, the second by 5, and the third by 3; the results will be these:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n120x + 80y + 60z &= 14880 \\\\\n100x + 75y + 60z &= 14100 \\\\\n90x + 72y + 60z &= 13680\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nLet the second equation be now subtracted from the first, and the third from the second, and we have\n\n\\[2ax + 5y = 780\\]\n\\[10x + 3y = 420\\]\n\nNext to exterminate \\(y\\), let the first of these equations be multiplied by 3, and the second by 5, hence\n\n\\[60x + 15y = 2340\\]\n\\[50x + 15y = 2100\\]\n\nSubtracting now the latter equation from the former.\n\n\\[10x = 240\\]\n\nHence \\(x = 24\\)\n\nTherefore \\(y = \\frac{420 - 10x}{3} = 60\\)\n\nAnd \\(z = \\frac{1448 - 12x - 8y}{6} = 120\\).\n\n131. From the preceding examples, it is manifest in what manner any number of unknown quantities may be determined, by an equal number of equations, which contain only the first power of those quantities, in the numerators of the terms. Such are the following:\n\n\\[ax + by + cz = n\\]\n\\[dx + ey + fz = p\\]\n\\[gx + hy + kz = q\\]\n\nwhere \\(a, b, c, \\&c.\\) represent known, and \\(x, y, z\\) unknown quantities; and in every case of this kind, the unknown quantities may be directly found, for they will be always expressed by whole numbers, or rational fractions, provided that the known quantities \\(a, b, c, \\&c.\\) are also rational.\n\n132. We shall now add a few examples, in which the equations that result from the extermination of an unknown quantity arise to some of the higher degrees; and therefore their final solution must be referred to the sections which treat of those degrees.\n\nEx. 6. Let \\(x = y = 2\\), and \\(xy + 5x - 6y = 120\\); it is required to exterminate \\(x\\).\n\nFrom the first equation \\(x = y + 2\\); which value being substituted in the other equation according to the second general method (§126) it becomes\n\n\\[(y + 2)y + 5(y + 2) - 6y = 120\\]\n\nthat is, \\(y^2 + 2y + 5y + 10 - 6y = 120\\)\n\ntherefore the equation required is \\(y^2 + y = 110\\).\n\nEx. 7. There is given \\(x + y = a\\), and \\(x^2 + y^2 = b\\) to exterminate \\(x\\).\n\n- From the first equation \\(x = a - y\\), and \\(x^2 = (a - y)^2\\).\n- And from the second \\(x^2 = b - y^2\\).\n\nTherefore \\((a - y)^2 = b - y^2\\)\n\nThat is \\(a^2 - 2ay + y^2 = b - y^2\\)\n\nHence \\(2y^2 - 2ay = b - a^2\\); an equation involving only \\(y\\).\n\nEx. 8. Given \\(\\begin{cases} ax + bx + cy = d \\\\ fxy + gx + hy = k \\end{cases}\\) To exterminate \\(y\\).\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\(y = \\frac{d - bx}{ax + c}\\).\n\nAnd from the second \\(y = \\frac{k - gx}{fx + b}\\)\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{d - bx}{ax + c} = \\frac{k - gx}{fx + b}\\), an equation in which the unknown quantity \\(y\\) is not found.\n\nEx. 9. Given \\(\\begin{cases} y^2 - 3xy + ay = x^2 \\\\ y^2 + 2ax - by = 4x^2 - b^2 \\end{cases}\\) To exterminate \\(y\\).\n\nAs the coefficient of \\(y^2\\) is unity in both equations, if their difference be taken the highest power of \\(y\\) will vanish; but to give a general solution, let the terms of the equations be brought all to one side and made equal to 0, thus,\n\n\\[y^2 - (3x + a)y - x^2 = 0\\]\n\\[y^2 - by + 2ax - 4x^2 + b^2 = 0\\]\n\nLet us in the first equation put \\(i = A, -(3x + a) = B, -x^2 = C\\); and in the second, \\(i = D, -b = E, 2ax - 4x^2 + b^2 = F\\) and the two equations become\n\n\\[Ay^2 + By + C = 0\\]\n\\[Dy^2 + Ey + F = 0\\]\n\nTo exterminate \\(y^2\\), let the first equation be multiplied by \\(D\\), and the second by \\(A\\), and we have\n\n\\[ADy^2 + BDy + CD = 0\\]\n\\[ADy^2 + AFy + AF = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, taking the difference of these equations,\n\n\\[(BD - AE)y + CD - AF = 0\\]\n\nAnd \\(y = \\frac{AF - CD}{BD - AE}\\)\n\nAgain, to find another value of \\(y\\), multiply the first equation by \\(F\\), and the second by \\(C\\), then\n\n\\[AFy^2 + BFy + CF = 0\\]\n\\[CDy^2 + CY + CF = 0\\]\n\nTherefore, subtracting as before, we get\n\n\\[(AF - CD)y + (BF - CE)y = 0\\]\n\nAnd dividing by \\(y\\) \\((AF - CD)y + BF - CE = 0\\),\n\nTherefore, \\(y = \\frac{CE - BF}{AF - CD}\\).\n\nLet this value of \\(y\\) be put equal to the former value, thus we have \\(\\frac{AF - CD}{BD - AE} = \\frac{CE - BF}{AF - CD}\\),\n\nAnd therefore \\((AF - CD)^2 = (BD - AE)(CE - BF)\\).\n\nNow as \\(y\\) does not enter this equation, if we restore the values of \\(A, B, C, \\&c.\\) we have the following equation which involves only \\(x\\), and known quantities.\n\n\\[(b^2 + 2ax - 3x^2)^2 = (a + b - 3x)(bx^2 - (a - 3x)(2ax - 4x^2 + b^2))\\] this equation when properly reduced will be of the fourth order, and therefore its final resolution belongs not to this place.\n\nSect. VIII. Questions producing Simple Equations.\n\n133. When a problem is proposed to be resolved by the algebraic method of analysis, its true meaning ought in the first place to be perfectly understood, so that, if necessary, it may be freed from all superfluous and ambiguous expressions; and its conditions exhibited in the clearest point of view possible. The several quantities concerned in the problem are next to be denoted by proper symbols, and their relations to one another expressed agreeably to the algebraic notation.\n\nThus\nThus we shall obtain a series of equations, which, if the question be properly limited, will enable us to determine all the unknown quantities required by the rules already delivered in the two preceding sections.\n\n134. In reducing the conditions of a problem to equations, the following rule will be of service. Suppose that the quantities to be determined are actually found, and then consider by what operations the truth of the solution may be verified; then, let the same operations be performed upon the quantities, whether known or unknown, and thus all the conditions of the problem will be reduced to a series of equations, such as is required. For example; suppose that it is required to find two numbers, such, that their sum is 20, and the quotient arising from the division of their difference by the lesser 3; then if we denote the greater of the two numbers by \\( x \\), and the lesser by \\( y \\), and proceed as if to prove the truth of the solution, we shall have \\( x+y=20 \\) for the sum of the numbers, and \\( x-y=3 \\) for their difference. Now as the former must be equal to 20, and the latter divided by \\( y \\) equal to 3; the first condition of the problem will be expressed by this equation \\( x+y=20 \\), and the second by \\( \\frac{x-y}{y}=3 \\), and from these, the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may easily be found.\n\n135. When the conditions of a problem have been expressed by equations, or as it were translated from the common language into that of algebra; we must next consider, whether the problem be properly limited; for in some cases, the conditions may be such as to admit of innumerable solutions; and in others, they may involve an absurdity; and thus render the problem altogether impossible.\n\n136. Now by considering the examples of last section, it will readily appear, that to determine any number of unknown quantities, there must be given as many equations, as there are unknown quantities. These equations, however, must be such as cannot be derived from each other; and they must not involve any contradiction; for, in the one case, the problem would admit of an unlimited number of answers; and in the other case, it would be impossible. For example, if it were required to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from these two equations, \\( 2x-3y=13 \\), \\( 4x-6y=26 \\); as the latter equation is a consequence of the former (for each term of the one is the half of the corresponding term of the other) it is evident, that innumerable values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) might be found to satisfy both equations. Again, if \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) were to be determined from these equations, \\( x+2y=8 \\), \\( 3x+6y=26 \\), it will quickly appear, that it is impossible to find such values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), as will satisfy both equations; for from the first of them, we find \\( 3x=24-6y \\); and from the second, \\( 3x=26-6y \\); and therefore \\( 24-6y=26-6y \\), or \\( 24=26 \\), which is absurd; and so also must have been the conditions from which this conclusion is drawn.\n\n137. But there is yet another case in which a problem may be impossible; and that is, when there are more equations than unknown quantities; for it appears, that in this case, by the rules of last section, we would at least find two equations, each involving the same unknown quantity. Now unless these equations happened to agree, the problem would admit of no solution. Upon the whole, therefore, it appears, that a problem is limited, when the conditions afford just as many independent equations, as there are unknown quantities to be determined; if there be fewer equations the problem is indeterminate; but if there be more, the problem in general admits of no solution whatever.\n\n138. In expressing the conditions of a problem by equations, it will, in general, be convenient to introduce as few symbols of unknown quantities as possible. Therefore, if two quantities be sought and their sum be given, suppose it \\( =s \\), then if the one quantity be represented by \\( x \\), the other may be denoted by \\( s-x \\). If again their difference be given \\( =d \\), the quantities may be denoted by \\( x \\) and \\( d+x \\), or by \\( x \\) and \\( x-d \\). If their product be given \\( =p \\), the quantities are \\( x \\) and \\( \\frac{p}{x} \\); and so on.\n\n139. We shall now apply the preceding observations to some examples, which are so chosen as to admit of being resolved by simple equations.\n\nEx. 1. What is that number, to which if there be added its half, its third, and its fourth part, the sum will be 50.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the number sought. Then its half will be \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\), its third \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) and its fourth \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{x}{4}=50 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( 24x+12x+8x+6x=1200 \\)\n\nOr \\( 50x=1200 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x=24 \\).\n\nThus it appears, that the number sought is 24, which upon trial will be found to answer the conditions of the question.\n\nEx. 2. A post is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its length in the mud, \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) in the water, and 10 feet above the water, what is its whole length?\n\nLet its length be \\( x \\) feet, then the part in the mud is \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), and that in the water \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\); therefore, from the nature of the question\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{4} + \\frac{x}{3} + 10 = x. \\]\n\nFrom which equation we find \\( 7x+120=12x \\), and \\( x=24 \\).\n\nEx. 3. Two travellers set out at the same time from London and York, whose distance is 150 miles; one of them goes 8 miles a day, and the other 7; in what time will they meet?\n\nSuppose that they meet after \\( x \\) days.\n\nThen the one traveller has gone \\( 8x \\) miles, and the other \\( 7x \\) miles; now the sum of the distances they travel is, by the question, equal to the distance from London to York.\n\nTherefore \\( 8x+7x=150 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 15x=150 \\), and \\( x=10 \\) days.\n\nEx. 4. A labourer engaged to serve for 40 days, upon these conditions; that for every day he worked he was to receive 20d. but for every day he played, or was absent, he was to forfeit 8d.; now at the end\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of days he worked.\n\nThen will \\( 40 - x \\) be the number of days he was idle.\n\nAlso \\( 20x = 20x \\) is the sum he earned, in pence.\n\nAnd \\( 8(40-x) = 320 - 8x \\) is the sum he forfeited.\n\nNow the difference of these two was \\( 11.11s. 8d. \\) or \\( 380d. \\)\n\nTherefore \\( 20x - (320 - 8x) = 380 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 28x = 700 \\)\n\nHence \\( x = 25 \\) is the number of days he worked.\n\nAnd \\( 40 - x = 15 \\) is the number of days he was idle.\n\nEx. 5. A market woman bought a certain number of eggs at 2 a-penny, and as many at 3 a-penny; and sold them all out again at 5 for 2d.; but instead of getting her own money for them, as she expected, she lost 4d.: what number of eggs did she buy?\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of eggs of each sort.\n\nThen will \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) be the price of the first sort,\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{x}{3} \\) be the price of the second sort.\n\nNow the whole number being \\( 2x \\), we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{2x} : \\frac{2}{4x} = \\text{price of both sorts at } 5 \\text{ for } 2d.\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{3} = \\frac{4x}{5} = 4 \\), by the question.\n\nHence \\( 15x + 10x - 24x = 120 \\),\n\nAnd \\( x = 120 \\), the number of each sort.\n\nEx. 6. A bill of 120l. was paid in guineas and moidores; the number of pieces of both sorts that were used was 120; how many were there of each?\n\nLet the number of guineas be \\( x \\).\n\nThen the number of moidores will be \\( 100 - x \\).\n\nAlso the value of the guineas, reckoned in shillings, will be \\( 21x \\); and that of the moidores \\( 27(100-x) = 2700 - 27x \\).\n\nTherefore, by the question, \\( 21x + 2700 - 27x = 2400 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( 6x = 300 \\) and \\( x = 50 \\).\n\nSo that the number of pieces of each sort was 50.\n\nEx. 7. A footman agreed to serve his master for 3l. a-year, and livery; but was turned away at the end of 7 months, and received only 2l. 13s. 4d. and his livery; what was its value?\n\nSuppose \\( x \\) the value of the livery, in pence.\n\nThen his wages for a year were to be \\( x + 1920 \\) pence.\n\nBut for 7 months he received \\( x + 640 \\) pence.\n\nNow he was paid in proportion to the time he served.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{m} \\quad \\frac{m}{m}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( 12 : 7 : : x + 1920 : x + 640 \\)\n\nAnd taking the product of the extremes, and means.\n\n\\[\n12x + 7680 = 7x + 13440.\n\\]\n\nHence \\( 5x = 5760d. \\) and \\( x = 1152d. = 4l. 16s. \\)\n\nEx. 8. A person at play lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his money, and then won 3 shillings; after which he lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of what he then had; and then won 2 shillings; lastly, he lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of what he then had; and this done, found he had only 12 shillings left; what had he at first?\n\nSuppose he began play with \\( x \\) shillings.\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of his money, or \\( \\frac{x}{4} \\), and had left \\( x - \\frac{x}{4} = \\frac{3x}{4} \\).\n\nHe won 3s. and had then \\( \\frac{3x}{4} + 3 = \\frac{3x + 12}{4} \\).\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{3x + 12}{4} \\), or \\( \\frac{x + 4}{4} \\), and had left \\( \\frac{3x + 12}{4} - \\frac{x + 4}{4} = \\frac{2x + 8}{4} \\).\n\nHe won 2s. and had then \\( \\frac{2x + 8}{4} + 2 = \\frac{2x + 16}{4} \\).\n\nHe lost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{4} \\) or \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{28} \\), and had left \\( \\frac{2x + 16}{4} - \\frac{2x + 16}{28} = \\frac{12x + 96}{28} \\).\n\nAnd because he had now 12s. left, we have this equation \\( \\frac{12x + 96}{28} = 12 \\).\n\nHence \\( 12x = 240 \\) and \\( x = 20 \\).\n\nEx. 9. Two tradesmen A and B are employed upon a piece of work, A can perform it alone in 15 hours, and B in 10 hours; in what time will they do it when working together.\n\nSuppose that they can do it in \\( x \\) hours, and let the whole work be denoted by 1.\n\nThen \\( \\frac{b}{a} : \\frac{b}{b} : : 1 : \\frac{x}{15} \\) is the part of the work done by A.\n\nAnd \\( \\frac{b}{a} : \\frac{b}{b} : : 1 : \\frac{x}{10} \\) is the part done by B.\n\nNow by the question, they are to perform the whole work between them;\n\nTherefore, \\( \\frac{x}{15} + \\frac{x}{10} = 1 \\),\n\nHence \\( 25x = 150 \\) and \\( x = 6 \\) hours.\n\nEx. 10. The sum of any two quantities being given \\( = s \\), and their difference \\( = d \\), it is required to find each of the quantities.\n\nLet \\( x \\) denote the greater of the two quantities, and \\( y \\) the lesser.\n\nThen \\( x + y = s \\), and \\( x - y = d \\).\n\nTaking the sum of the equations we get \\( 2x = s + d \\).\n\nAnd subtracting the second from the first, \\( 2y = s - d \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{s + d}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{s - d}{2} \\).\n\nEx. 11. A gentleman distributing money among some poor people, found he wanted 10s. to be able to give each 5s. therefore he gave only 4s. to each, and had 5s. left. Required the number of shillings and poor people.\n\nLet the number of shillings be \\( x \\), and that of the poor people \\( y \\), then from the nature of the question we have these two equations.\n\n\\[\n5y = x + 10 \\quad 4y = x - 5\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( x = 5y - 10 \\),\n\nAnd from the second, \\( x = 4y + 5 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( 5y - 10 = 4y + 5 \\),\n\nHence \\( y = 15 \\), and \\( x = 4y + 5 = 65 \\).\nEx. 12. A farmer kept a servant for every 40 acres of ground he rented, and on taking a lease of 104 more acres, he engaged 5 additional servants, after which he had a servant for every 36 acres. Required the number of servants and acres.\n\nSuppose that he had at first $x$ servants, and $y$ acres.\n\nFrom the first condition of the question $x = \\frac{y}{40}$\n\nAnd from the second $x + 5 = \\frac{y + 104}{36}$\n\nBy comparing the values of $x$, as found from these equations, we have $\\frac{y + 104}{36} - 5 = \\frac{y}{40}$.\n\nHence $40(y + 104) - 7200 = 36y$, so that $4y = 3240$.\n\nTherefore $y = 760$, and $x = \\frac{y}{40} = 19$.\n\nEx. 13. Two persons, A and B, were talking of their ages; says A to B, seven years ago I was just three times as old as you were then, and seven years hence I shall be just twice as old as you will be. What is their present ages?\n\nLet the ages of A and B be $x$ and $y$ respectively. Their ages seven years ago were $x - 7$ and $y - 7$, and seven years hence they will be $x + 7$ and $y + 7$.\n\nTherefore by the question $x - 7 = 3(y - 7)$ and $x + 7 = 2(y + 7)$.\n\nFrom the first equation, $x = 3y - 14$,\n\nAnd from the second $x = 2y + 7$.\n\nTherefore $3y - 14 = 2y + 7$, hence $y = 21$.\n\nAnd because $x = 2y + 7$, therefore $x = 49$.\n\nEx. 14. A hare is 50 leaps before a greyhound, and takes 4 leaps to the greyhound's 3, but 2 of the greyhound's leaps are as much as 3 of the hare's. How many leaps must the greyhound take to catch the hare?\n\nIn this example there is only one quantity required, it will, however, be convenient to make use of two letters; therefore let $x$ denote the number of leaps of the greyhound, and $y$ those of the hare; then, by considering the proportion between the number of leaps each takes in the same time, we have\n\n$3 : 4 :: x : y$, hence $3y = 4x$.\n\nAgain, by considering the proportion between the number of leaps each must take to run the same distance, we find $x : 50 + y :: 2 : 3$, hence $100 + 2y = 3x$.\n\nFrom the first equation we find $6y = 8x$,\n\nAnd from the second $6y = 9x - 300$,\n\nHence $9x - 300 = 8x$, and $x = 300$.\n\nEx. 15. To divide the number 90 into 4 such parts, that if the first be increased by 2, the second diminished by 2, the third multiplied by 2, and the fourth divided by 2; the sum, difference, product, and quotient, shall be all equal to each other.\n\nIn this question there are four quantities to be determined; but instead of introducing several letters, having put $x$ to denote the first of them, we may find an expression for each of the remaining ones, as follows:\n\nBecause $x + 2 =$ second quantity — 2,\n\nTherefore $x + 4 =$ the second quantity.\n\nAnd because $x + 2 =$ third $\\times 2$,\n\nTherefore $\\frac{x + 2}{2} =$ the third quantity.\n\nAnd in like manner $2(x + 2) =$ the fourth quantity,\n\nNow by the question, the sum of all the four = 90,\n\nTherefore $x + x + 4 + \\frac{x + 2}{2} + 2(x + 2) = 90$;\n\nHence $9x = 162$, and $x = 18$.\n\nTherefore the numbers required are 18, 22, 10, and 43.\n\nEx. 16. A and B together can perform a piece of work in 12 hours, A and C in 20, and B and C in 15 hours; in what time will each be able to perform it when working separately?\n\nThat we may give a general solution, let us suppose A and B can perform the work in $a$ hours, A and C in $b$ hours, and B and C in $c$ hours. Let $x$, $y$, and $z$, denote the times in which A, B, and C, could perform it respectively, if each wrought alone; and let the whole work be represented by 1.\n\nHH\n\nThen $x : a :: \\frac{a}{x} =$ the part done by A in $a$ hours.\n\n$y : a :: \\frac{a}{y} =$ the part done by B in $b$ hours.\n\nAlso $x : b :: \\frac{b}{x} =$ the part done by A in $b$ hours.\n\n$z : b :: \\frac{b}{z} =$ the part done by C in $c$ hours.\n\nAnd $y : c :: \\frac{c}{y} =$ the part done by B in $c$ hours.\n\n$z : c :: \\frac{c}{z} =$ the part done by C in $c$ hours.\n\nNow by the question we have the three following equations.\n\n$\\frac{a}{x} + \\frac{a}{y} + \\frac{b}{x} + \\frac{b}{y} + \\frac{c}{x} + \\frac{c}{y} = 1$.\n\nLet the first equation be divided by $a$, the second by $b$, and the third by $c$, thus we have\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}$.\n\nIf these be added together, and their sum divided by 2, we find\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c}$.\n\nFrom this equation let each of the three last be subtracted in its turn; thus we get\n\n$\\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{ab + ac + bc}{2abc}$\n\n$\\frac{1}{y} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{abc - ac + bc}{2abc}$\n\n$\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{2a} + \\frac{1}{2b} + \\frac{1}{2c} = \\frac{abc - ab + ac}{2abc}$\n\nHence $z = \\frac{2abc}{ab + ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{120} = 60$\n\n$y = \\frac{2abc}{ab - ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{360} = 20$\n\n$x = \\frac{2abc}{ab + ac + bc} = \\frac{7200}{240} = 30$.\nSect. IX. Of Quadratic Equations.\n\n140. We are next to explain the manner of resolving equations of the second degree, or quadratic equations. These involve the second power of the unknown quantity, as has been already observed (§ 113.) and may be divided into two kinds, pure and affected.\n\n141. I. Pure quadratic equations are such as after proper reduction have the square of the unknown quantity in one term, while the remaining terms contain only known quantities. Thus, \\(x^2 = 64\\), and \\(ax^2 + bx = c\\) are examples of pure quadratics.\n\n142. II. Affected quadratic equations, contain the square of the unknown quantity in one term, and its first or simple power in another, and the remaining terms consist entirely of known quantities. Such are the following, \\(x^2 + 3x = 28\\), \\(2x^2 - 33 - 5x\\), \\(ax^2 + bx = c = d\\).\n\n143. The manner of resolving a pure quadratic equation is sufficiently evident; if the unknown quantity be made to stand alone on one side, with unity as a coefficient, while the other side consists entirely of known quantities, and if the square root of each side be taken, we shall immediately obtain the value of the simple power of the unknown quantity as already directed by Rule 5th of Sect. VI.\n\n144. In extracting the square root of any quantity, however, it is necessary to observe, that the sign of the root may be either \\(+\\) or \\(-\\). This is an evident consequence of the rule for the signs in multiplication; for since by that rule any quantity, whether positive or negative, if multiplied by itself, will produce a positive quantity, and therefore the square of \\(+\\) \\(a\\), as well as that of \\(-\\) \\(a\\) is \\(+\\) \\(a^2\\); so on the contrary, the square root of \\(+\\) \\(a^2\\) is to be considered either as \\(+\\) \\(a\\) or as \\(-\\) \\(a\\), and may accordingly be expressed thus \\(=\\pm a\\).\n\n145. Having remarked that the square of any quantity whatever be its sign, is always positive; it evidently follows, that no real quantity whatever, when multiplied by itself, can produce a negative quantity; and therefore, if the square root of a negative quantity be required, no such root can be assigned. Hence it also follows, that if a problem requires for its solution the extraction of the square root of a negative quantity, some contradiction must necessarily be involved, either in the conditions of the problem, or in the process of reasoning by which that solution has been obtained.\n\n146. When an affected quadratic equation is to be resolved, it may always, by proper reduction, be brought to one or other of the three following forms.\n\n1. \\(x^2 + px = q\\)\n2. \\(x^2 - px = q\\)\n3. \\(x^2 - px = -q\\)\n\nBut as the manner of resolving each of the three forms is the very same, it will be sufficient if we consider any one of them.\n\n147. Resuming therefore the first equation, or \\(x^2 + px = q\\); let us compare the side of it which involves the unknown quantity \\(x\\) with the square of a binomial \\(x + a\\); that is, let us compare \\(x^2 + px\\) with \\(x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = (x + a)^2\\); and it will presently appear, that if we suppose \\(p = 2a\\), or \\(\\frac{p}{2} = a\\), the quantities \\(x^2 + px\\) and \\(x^2 + 2ax\\) will be equal; and as \\(x^2 + 2ax\\) is rendered a complete square, by adding to it \\(a^2\\), so also may \\(x^2 + px\\) be completed into a square, by adding to it \\(\\frac{p^2}{4}\\), which is equal to \\(a^2\\); therefore, let \\(\\frac{p^2}{4}\\) be added to both sides of the equation \\(x^2 + px = q\\), and we have\n\n\\[x^2 + px + \\frac{p^2}{4} = \\frac{p^2}{4} + q,\\]\n\nor \\((x + \\frac{p}{2})^2 = \\frac{p^2}{4} + q\\);\n\nand extracting the square root of each side, \\(x + \\frac{p}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} + q}\\); hence \\(x = \\frac{-p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} + q}\\).\n\n148. From these observations, we derive the following general rule for resolving affected quadratic equations.\n\n1. Transpose all the terms involving the unknown quantity to one side, and the known quantities to the other side, and so that the term involving the square of the unknown quantity may be positive.\n\n2. If the square of the unknown quantity be multiplied by a coefficient, let all the other terms be divided by it, so that the coefficient of the square of the unknown quantity may be 1.\n\n3. Add to both sides the square of half the coefficient of the unknown quantity itself, and the side of the equation involving the unknown quantity will now be a complete square.\n\n4. Extract the square root of both sides of the equation, by which it becomes simple with respect to the unknown quantity; and, by transposition, that quantity may be made to stand alone on one side of the equation, while the other side consists of known quantities; and therefore the equation is resolved.\n\nNote. The square root of the first side of the equation is always equal to the sum, or difference of the unknown quantity, and half the coefficient of the second term. If the sign of that term be \\(+\\), it is equal to the sum, but if it be \\(-\\), then it is equal to the difference.\n\nEx. 1. Given \\(x^2 + 2x = 35\\), to determine \\(x\\).\n\nHere the coefficient of the second term is 2, therefore, adding the square of its half to each side, we have\n\n\\[x^2 + 2x + 1 = 35 + 1 = 36\\]\n\nAnd extracting the square root \\(x + 1 = \\sqrt{36} = \\pm 6\\)\n\nHence \\(x = \\pm 6 - 1\\), that is \\(x = \\pm 5\\), or \\(x = \\pm 7\\), and either of these numbers will be found to satisfy the equation for \\(5 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 5 = 35\\), also \\(-7 \\times -7 + 2 \\times -7 = 35\\).\n\nEx. 2. Given \\(\\frac{x^2}{6} - 12 = x\\) to find \\(x\\).\n\nThis equation, when reduced, becomes \\(x^2 - 6x = 72\\). And by completing the square, \\(x^2 - 6x + 9 = 72 + 9 = 81\\).\n\nHence, by extracting the square root, \\(x - 3 = \\pm 9\\).\n\nAnd \\(x = \\pm 9 + 3\\), therefore \\(x = \\pm 12\\), or \\(x = \\pm 6\\), and upon trial we find that each of these values satisfies\nQuadratic Equations.\n\nSolve the original equation, for \\( \\frac{12 \\times 12}{6} - 12 = 12 \\), also\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6x - 6}{6} - 12 = -6.\n\\]\n\nEx. 3. Given \\( x^2 + 28 = 11x \\), to find \\( x \\).\n\nThen \\( x^2 - 11x = -28 \\).\n\nAnd, completing the square, \\( x^2 - 11x + \\frac{121}{4} = \\frac{121}{4} \\)\n\n\\[-28 = \\frac{9}{4}\\]\n\nTherefore, by extracting the root, \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n\nHence \\( x = \\frac{11}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\), that is \\( x = +7 \\), or \\( x = +4 \\).\n\nIn the first two examples, we found one positive value for \\( x \\) in each, and also one negative value, but in this example both the values of \\( x \\) are positive, and upon trial each of them is found to satisfy the equation; for \\( 7 \\times 7 + 28 = 11 \\times 7 \\), also \\( 4 \\times 4 + 28 = 11 \\times 4 \\).\n\nAs at first sight it appears remarkable, that in every quadratic equation the unknown quantity admits always of two distinct values, or roots, it will be proper to consider a little farther the circumstances upon which this peculiarity depends. This is the more necessary, as the property of the unknown quantity admitting of several values is not peculiar to quadratics, but takes place also in equations of the higher degrees, where the cause of the ambiguity requires an explanation somewhat different from that which we have already given in the present case.\n\nLet us again consider the equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\), which forms the first of the three preceding examples; by transposing all the terms to one side, the same equation may be also expressed thus, \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\); so that we shall have determined \\( x \\), when we have found such a number, as when substituted for it in the quantity \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 \\) will render the result equal to 0.\n\nBut \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 \\) is the product of these two factors \\( x - 5 \\) and \\( x + 7 \\), as may be proved by actual multiplication; therefore to find \\( x \\) we have \\( (x - 5)(x + 7) = 0 \\); and as a product can only be reduced to 0, when one of its factors is reduced to 0, it follows, that either of the two factors \\( x - 5 \\) or \\( x + 7 \\) may be assumed = 0; if \\( x - 5 = 0 \\), then \\( x = 5 \\); but if \\( x + 7 = 0 \\), then \\( x = -7 \\), so that the two values of \\( x \\), or two roots of the equation \\( x^2 + 2x - 35 = 0 \\) are \\( +5 \\) and \\( -7 \\), as we have already found in a different manner.\n\nWhat has been just now shown in a particular case is true of any quadratic equation whatever, that is, if \\( x^2 + px = q \\), or by bringing all the terms to one side, \\( x^2 + px - q = 0 \\), it is always possible to find two factors \\( x + a \\) and \\( x - b \\), such, that \\( x^2 + px - q = (x + a)(x - b) \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are known quantities which depend only upon \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) the given numbers in the equation, and hence that to have \\( (x - a)(x + b) = 0 \\), we may either assume \\( x - a = 0 \\), or \\( x + b = 0 \\), it evidently follows that the conditions of the equation \\( x^2 + px - q = 0 \\), or \\( x^2 + px = q \\) are alike satisfied by taking \\( x = +a \\) or \\( x = -b \\).\n\nFrom these considerations, it follows, that \\( x \\) can have only two values in a quadratic equation; for if it could be supposed to have three, or more values, then it would be possible to resolve \\( x^2 + px - q \\) into as many factors \\( x - a \\), \\( x - b \\), &c., but the product of more than two factors must necessarily contain the third or higher powers of \\( x \\); and as \\( x^2 + px - q \\) contains no higher power than the second, therefore no such resolution can take place.\n\nSince it appears that \\( x^2 + px - q \\) may be considered as the product of two factors \\( x - a \\), and \\( x + b \\), let us examine the nature of these factors; accordingly, taking their product by actual multiplication, we find it \\( x^2 + (b - a)x - ab \\); and since this quantity must be equal to \\( x^2 + px - q \\), it follows, that \\( b - a = p \\) and \\( ab = q \\), or, changing the signs of the terms of both equations, \\( a - b = -p \\), \\( ab = -q \\). Now if we consider that \\( +a \\) and \\( -b \\) are the roots of the equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\); it is evident that \\( a - b \\) is the sum of the roots, and \\( -ab \\) their product. So that from the equations \\( a - b = -p \\), and \\( -ab = q \\), we derive the following proposition relating to the roots of any quadratic equation. The sum of the roots of any quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\) is equal to \\( -p \\), that is to the coefficient of the second term, having its sign changed; and their product is equal to \\( -q \\), or to the latter side of the equation, having its sign also changed.\n\nThis proposition enables us to resolve several important questions concerning the roots of a quadratic equation, without actually resolving that equation. Thus we learn from it, that if \\( q \\), the term which does not involve the unknown quantity (called sometimes the absolute number) be positive, the equation has one of its roots positive, and the other negative; but if that term be negative, the roots are either both positive or both negative. It also follows, that in the former case the root which is denoted by the least number will have the same sign with the second term, and in the latter case, the common sign of the roots will be the contrary to that of the second term.\n\nFrom this property of the roots we may also derive a general solution to any quadratic equation \\( x^2 + px = q \\); for we have only to determine two quantities whose sum is \\( -p \\), and product \\( -q \\), and these quantities shall be the two values of \\( x \\), or the two roots of the equation.\n\nWithout considering the signs of the roots, let us call them \\( v \\) and \\( z \\), then\n\n\\[ v + z = -p \\quad \\text{and} \\quad vz = -q \\]\n\nFrom the square of each side of the first equation let four times the second be subtracted and we have\n\n\\[ v^2 - 2vz + z^2 = p^2 + 4q, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad (v - z)^2 = p^2 + 4q, \\]\n\ntherefore, by extracting the square root, \\( v - z = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q} \\); from this equation, and from the equation \\( v + z = -p \\), we readily obtain \\( v = \\frac{-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2} \\)\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p \\mp \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{that is, if} \\quad v = \\frac{-p + \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{then} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p - \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{and if} \\quad v = \\frac{-p - \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}, \\quad \\text{then} \\]\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{-p + \\sqrt{p^2 + 4q}}{2}. \\]\n\nBut the value of \\( v \\), upon the one supposition, is the same as the value of \\( z \\) upon the other supposition, and vice versa, therefore in reality the only two distinct\nEx. 1. It is required to divide the number 10 into two such parts, that the sum of their squares may be 58.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number. Then, since their sum is 10, we have \\( 10 - x \\) for the other.\n\nAnd by the question \\( x^2 + (10-x)^2 = 58 \\)\n\nThat is \\( x^2 + 10x - 2x^2 + x^2 = 58 \\)\n\nOr \\( 2x^2 - 20x + 100 = 42 \\)\n\nHence \\( x^2 - 10x = 21 \\)\n\nAnd completing the square \\( x^2 - 10x + 25 = 25 - 21 = 4 \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root, \\( x - 5 = \\pm \\sqrt{4} = \\pm 2 \\)\n\nAnd \\( x = 7 \\) or \\( x = 3 \\)\n\nIf we take the greatest value of \\( x \\), viz. 7, then the other number \\( 10 - x \\) will be 3; and if we take the least value of \\( x \\), viz. 3, then the other number is 7.\n\nThus it appears, that the greatest value of the one number corresponds to the least value of the other; and indeed this must necessarily be the case, seeing that both numbers are alike concerned in the question. Hence upon the whole, the only numbers that will answer the conditions of the question are 7 and 3.\n\nEx. 2. What two numbers are those whose product is 28; and such, that twice the greater, together with thrice the lesser is equal to 26.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the greatest and \\( y \\) the least number, then, from the nature of the question, we have these two equations\n\n\\[\nxy = 28, \\quad 2x + 3y = 26.\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( y = \\frac{28}{x} \\).\n\nAnd from the second \\( y = \\frac{26 - 2x}{3} \\).\n\nHence, \\( \\frac{26 - 2x}{3} = \\frac{28}{x} \\).\n\nAnd, reducing, \\( 26x - 2x^2 = 84 \\)\n\nOr \\( 2x^2 - 26x = -84 \\)\n\nHence \\( x^2 - 13x = -42 \\)\n\nAnd comp. the eq. \\( x^2 - 13x + \\frac{169}{4} = \\frac{169}{4} - 42 = \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root \\( x - \\frac{13}{2} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{13}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThat is \\( x = 7 \\), or \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( y = \\frac{28}{x} \\), we have \\( y = 4 \\), or \\( y = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nThus we have obtained two sets of numbers, which fulfil the conditions required, viz.\n\n\\( x = 7, y = 4 \\); Or \\( x = 6, y = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nAnd besides these, there can be no other numbers.\n\nEx. 3. A company dining together at an inn, find their bill amount to 175 shillings; two of them were not allowed to pay, and the rest found, that their shares amounted to 10 shillings a man more than if they had all paid. How many were in company?\n\nSuppose their number to be \\( x \\).\n\nThen, if all had paid, the share of each would have been \\( \\frac{175}{x} \\).\nQuadratic Equations.\n\nBut, because only \\( x - 2 \\) paid, the share of each was\n\n\\[\n\\frac{175}{x-2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by the question,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{175}{x-2} = 10.\n\\]\n\nAnd by proper reduction \\( 175x - 175x + 350 = 10x^2 \\)\n\nThat is \\( 10x^2 - 20x = 350 \\)\n\nOr \\( x^2 - 2x = 35 \\)\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x^2 - 2x + 1 = 36 \\)\n\nHence, by extracting the root, \\( x^2 + 1 = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x = 4 \\), or \\( x = -7 \\). But from the nature of the question, the negative root can be of no use; therefore \\( x = 6 \\).\n\nEx. 4. A merchant sold a piece of cloth for 24l. and gained as much per cent as the cloth cost him; what was the price of the cloth?\n\nSuppose that it cost \\( x \\) pounds,\n\nThen the gain was \\( 24 - x \\),\n\nAnd by the question \\( 100 : x :: x : 24 - x \\),\n\nTherefore, taking the product of the extremes and means,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2400 - 100x}{x} = x^2,\n\\]\n\nOr \\( x^2 + 100x = 2400 \\),\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x^2 + 100x + 2500 = 4900 \\),\n\nHence, taking the root, \\( x + 50 = \\pm 70 \\),\n\nAnd \\( x = 20 \\) or \\( x = -120 \\).\n\nHere, as in the last question, the negative root cannot apply; therefore \\( x = 20 \\) pounds, the price required.\n\nEx. 5. A grazier bought as many sheep as cost him 60l. out of which he reserved 15, and sold the remainder for 54l. and gained 2s. each upon them. How many sheep did he buy, and what did each cost him?\n\nSuppose that he bought \\( x \\) sheep,\n\nThen each would cost him \\( \\frac{1200}{x} \\) shillings.\n\nTherefore, after reserving 15, he sold each of the remaining \\( x - 15 \\) for \\( \\frac{1200}{x} + 2 \\) shillings;\n\nHence, he would receive for them \\( (x - 15)(\\frac{1200}{x} + 2) \\) shillings. And, because 54l. = 1080 shillings, we have by the question\n\n\\[\n(x - 15)(\\frac{1200}{x} + 2) = 1080.\n\\]\n\nWhich by proper reduction becomes \\( x^2 + 45x = 9000 \\).\n\nOr, completing the square, \\( x^2 + 45x + \\frac{2025}{4} = \\frac{38025}{4} \\).\n\nTherefore, extracting the root, &c. \\( x = \\pm \\frac{195}{2} \\pm \\frac{45}{2} \\).\n\nAnd taking the positive root, \\( x = 75 \\), the number of sheep; and consequently \\( \\frac{1200}{75} = 16 \\) shillings the price of each.\n\nEx. 6. What number is that, which, when divided by the product of its two digits, the quotient is 3; and if 18 be added to it, the digits are inverted. Let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote the digits; then the number itself will be expressed by \\( 10x + y \\); and that number, in which the digits are inverted, by \\( 10y + x \\). Thus the conditions of the problem will be expressed by these two equations,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10x + y}{xy} = 3, \\quad 10x + y + 18 = 10y + x.\n\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we have \\( y = \\frac{10x}{3x - 1} \\).\n\nAnd from the second \\( y = x + 2 \\).\n\nTherefore \\( x + 2 = \\frac{10x}{3x - 1} \\).\n\nAnd \\( 3x^2 + 5x - 2 = 10x \\).\n\nHence \\( x^2 - \\frac{5}{3}x = \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nAnd comp. sq. \\( x^2 - \\frac{5}{3}x + \\frac{25}{9} = \\frac{37}{9} \\).\n\nTherefore, taking the root \\( x = \\frac{5}{3} \\pm \\frac{2}{3} \\).\n\nSo that \\( x = 2 \\), or \\( x = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\nHere it is evident that the negative root is useless; hence we have \\( y = x + 2 = 4 \\), and 24 for the number required.\n\nEx. 7. It is required to find two numbers whose product is 100; and the difference of their square roots 3.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number; then \\( \\frac{100}{x} \\) must denote the other.\n\nNow by the question \\( \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{x} = 3 \\).\n\nHence we have \\( 10 - x = 3 \\sqrt{x} = 3x^{1/2} \\).\n\nOr \\( x + 3x^{1/2} = 10 \\).\n\nAnd comp. the sq. \\( x + 3x^{1/2} + \\frac{9}{4} = 10 + \\frac{25}{4} \\).\n\nand taking the root \\( x^{1/2} + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{17}{2} \\).\n\nSo that \\( x^{1/2} = 5 \\) or \\( x^{1/2} = -2 \\),\n\nand therefore \\( x = 25 \\) or \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 4 \\), the other number is \\( \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\), and if \\( x = 25 \\), then the other number is 4; so that, in either case, the two numbers which answer the conditions of the question are 4 and 25.\n\nEx. 8. It is required to find two numbers, of which the product shall be 6, and the sum of their cubes 35.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the one number, then \\( \\frac{6}{x} \\) will be the other.\n\nTherefore, by the question, \\( x^2 + \\frac{216}{x^3} = 35 \\).\n\nHence \\( x^6 + 216 = 35x^3 \\).\n\nOr \\( x^6 - 35x^3 = -216 \\).\n\nThis equation, by putting \\( x^3 = y \\), becomes \\( y^2 - 35y = -216 \\).\n\nHence we find \\( y = 27 \\), or \\( y = 8 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( x^3 = y \\); therefore \\( x = 3 \\), or \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 3 \\), then the other number is 2, and if \\( x = 2 \\), the other number is 3; so that 2 and 3 are the numbers required.\n\nIn general, if it be required to find two numbers, which are exactly alike concerned in a question that produces a quadratic equation; the two numbers sought will be the roots of that equation. A similar observation applies to any number of quantities which require for the determination the resolution of an equation of any degree whatever.\n\nSect. X. Of Equations in General.\n\n160. Before we proceed to the resolution of cubic, and the higher orders of equations, it will be proper to\nEquations to explain some general properties, which belong to\nequations of every degree; and also certain operations,\nwhich must frequently be performed upon equations,\nbefore they are fitted for a final solution.\n\n161. In treating of equations in general, we shall\nsuppose all the terms transposed to one side, and put\nequal to 0; this we have already done in exploiting\nthe nature of quadratics, and in like manner an equa-\ntion of the fourth degree will stand thus:\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwhere \\( x \\) denotes an unknown quantity, and \\( p, q, r, s \\)\nknown quantities, either positive or negative. In this\nequation the coefficient of the highest power of \\( x \\)\nis unity, but if it had been any other quantity, that\nquantity might have been taken away, and the equa-\ntion reduced to the above form, by rules already ex-\nplained, Sect. VI.\n\n162. The terms of an equation being thus arranged,\nif such a quantity be found, as when substituted for \\( x \\),\nwill render both sides \\( = 0 \\), and therefore satisfy the\nequation, that quantity whether it be positive or nega-\ntive, or even imaginary, is to be considered as a root\nof the equation. But we have seen that every qua-\ndratic equation has always two roots, real or imagi-\nnary, we may therefore suppose that a similar diversity\nof roots will take place in all equations of a higher de-\ngree; and this supposition we shall presently find to be\nwell founded, by means of the following proposition\nwhich is of great importance in the theory of equa-\ntions.\n\nIf a root of any equation, as \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\), be\nrepresented by \\( a \\), the first side of that equation is divi-\nsible by \\( x - a \\).\n\nFor since \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\)\n\nAnd also \\( a^4 + pa^3 + qa^2 + ra + s = 0 \\)\n\nTherefore, by subtraction, \\( x^4 - a^4 + p(x^3 - a^3) + q(x^2 - a^2) + r(x - a) = 0 \\).\n\n163. But any quantity of this form \\( x^n - a^n \\), where\n\\( n \\) denotes a whole positive number, is equal to\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x^{n-1}+ax^{n-2}+a^2x^{n-3}+\\ldots+a^{n-2}x+a^{n-1}),\n\\]\n\nas may be easily proved by multiplication; therefore,\nputting \\( x = a, b, c \\) successively, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 - a^4 &= (x-a)(x^3 + ax^2 + a^2x + a^3) \\\\\nx^3 - a^3 &= (x-a)(x^2 + ax + a^2) \\\\\nx^2 - a^2 &= (x-a)(x+a) \\\\\nx - a &= x-a\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand by substitution, and collecting into one term, the\ncoefficients of the like powers of \\( x \\), the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 - a^4 + p(x^3 - a^3) + q(x^2 - a^2) + r(x - a) = 0 \\]\n\nbecomes\n\n\\[\n(x-a)[x^3 + (a+p)x^2 + (a^2+pa+q)x + a^3 + pa + q] + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nso that putting \\( p' = a + p, q' = a^2 + pa + q, r' = a^3 + pa + q + r \\), we have\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r') \\]\n\nHence, if the proposed equation \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\)\nbe divided by \\( x - a \\), the quotient will be \\( x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' \\),\nan integer quantity, and since the same mode\nof reasoning will apply to any equation whatever; the\ntruth of the proposition is evident.\n\n164. We have found that \\( (x-a)(x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r') = 0 \\),\nand as a product becomes \\( = 0 \\), when any\none of its factors \\( = 0 \\), therefore, the equation will have\nits conditions fulfilled, not only when \\( x = a = 0 \\), but\nalso when \\( x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' = 0 \\).\n\nLet us now suppose that \\( b \\) is a root of this equation,\nthen by reasoning exactly as in last article, and putting\n\\( p'' = b + p', q'' = b^2 + pb + q' \\), we shall have\n\n\\[ x^3 + p'x^2 + q'x + r' = (x-b)(x^2 + p''x + q'') = 0 \\]\n\nand therefore\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x-b)(x^2 + p''x + q'') = 0 \\]\n\n165. By proceeding in the same manner with the\nquadratic equation \\( x^2 + p''x + q'' = 0 \\), we shall find that\nif \\( c \\) denote one of its roots, then\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-c)(x^2 + p''x + q'') \\]\n\nSo that if we put \\( d = (c + p'') \\), we at last find\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) \\]\n\nand since each of the factors \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, x-d \\)\nmay be assumed \\( = 0 \\); it follows, that there are four\ndifferent values of \\( x \\), which will render the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nnamely, \\( x = a, x = b, x = c, x = d \\).\n\n166. The mode of reasoning which has been just\nnow employed in a particular case, may be applied to\nan equation of any order whatever; we may therefore\nconclude, that every equation may be considered as the\nproduct of as many simple factors, as the number de-\nnoting its order contains unity; and therefore, that\nthe number of roots in any equation is precisely equal\nto the exponent of the highest power of the unknown\nquantity contained in that equation.\n\n167. By considering equations of all degrees as\nformed from the product of factors \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, \\)\n&c., we discover a number of curious relations, which\nsubsist between the roots of any equation whatever,\nand its coefficients. Thus, if we limit the number of\nfactors to four, and suppose that \\( a, b, c, d \\), are the roots\nof this equation of the fourth degree\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwe shall also have \\( (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = 0 \\); and\ntherefore, by actual multiplication\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 - a^4 &+ ab &+ ac &- abc \\\\\n-x^3 &+ ad &+ bc &- abd \\\\\n-x^2 &+ bd &+ cd &- acd \\\\\n-x &+ cd &- bcd \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n168. If we compare together the coefficients of the\nsame powers of \\( x \\), we find the following series of equa-\ntions:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na + b + c + d &- p \\\\\nab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd &- q \\\\\nabc + abd + acd + bcd &- r \\\\\nabcd &- s\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand as a similar series of equations will be obtained\nfor every equation whatever, we hence derive the fol-\nlowing propositions, which are of the greatest impor-\ntance in the theory of equations.\n\n1. The coefficient of the second term of any equa-\ntion taken with a contrary sign, is equal to the sum\nof all the roots.\n\n2. The coefficient of the third term is equal to the\nsum of the products of the roots multiplied together\ntwo and two.\n\n3. The coefficient of the fourth term, taken with a\ncontrary\nEquations contrary sign, is equal to the sum of the roots multiplied together three and three, and so on for the remaining coefficients, till we come to the last term of the equation, which is equal to the product of all the roots, having their signs changed.\n\n169. Instead of supposing an equation to be produced by multiplying together simple equations, we may consider it as formed by the product of equations of any degree, provided that the sum of their dimensions is equal to that of the proposed equation. Thus, an equation of the fourth degree may be formed either from a simple and cubic equation, or from two quadratic equations.\n\n170. If \\( n \\) denote the degree of an equation, we have shewn, that by considering it as the product of simple factors, that equation will have \\( n \\) divisors of the first degree; but if we suppose the simple factors to be combined two and two, they will form quantities of the second degree, which are also factors of the equation; and since there may be formed \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) such combinations, any equation will admit of \\( \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\) divisors of the second degree.\n\n171. For example, the equation \\( x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\) which we have considered as equal to\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = 0\n\\]\n\nmay be formed by the product of two factors of the second degree, in these five different ways.\n\nBy the product of \\((x-a)(x-b)\\) and \\((x-c)(x-d)\\)\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-c)(x-b)(x-d)\n\\]\n\nThus an equation of the fourth degree may have \\( \\frac{4 \\times 3}{1 \\times 2} = 6 \\) quadratic divisors.\n\n172. By combining the simple factors three and three, we shall have divisors of the third degree, of which the number for an equation of the \\( n \\)th order will be \\( \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3} \\); and so on.\n\n173. When the roots of an equation are all positive, its simple factors will have this form \\( x-a, x-b, x-c, \\ldots \\), &c., and if for the sake of brevity we take only these three, the cubic equation which results from their product will have this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 - px^2 + qx - r = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( p = a + b + c, q = ab + ac + bc, r = abc \\), and here it appears that the signs of the terms are \\( + \\) and \\( - \\) alternately.\n\nHence we infer, that when the roots of an equation are all positive, the signs of its terms are positive and negative alternately.\n\n174. If again the roots of the equation be all negative, and therefore its factors \\( x+a, x+b, x+c \\), then \\( p, q \\) and \\( r \\) being as before, the resulting equation will stand thus:\n\n\\[\nx^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0.\n\\]\n\nAnd hence we conclude, that when the roots are all negative, there is no change whatever in the signs.\n\n175. In general, if the roots of an equation be all real, that equation will have as many positive roots as there are changes of the signs from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\); and the remaining roots are negative. This rule, however, does not apply when the equation has imaginary roots, unless such roots be considered as either positive or negative.\n\n176. That the rule is true when applied to quadratic equations will be evident from Sec. IX. With respect to cubic equations, the rule also applies when the roots are either all positive, or all negative, as we have just now shewn.\n\nWhen a cubic equation has one positive root, and the other two negative, its factors will be \\( x-a, x+b, x+c \\), and the equation itself.\n\n\\[\nx^3 - ax^2 - bx - cx = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere there must always be one change of the signs, since the first term is positive, and the last negative; and there can be no more than one; for if the second term is negative, or \\( b+c \\) less than \\( a \\), then \\((b+c)^2\\) will be less than \\((b+c)a\\); but \\((b+c)^2\\) is always greater than \\( bc \\), therefore \\( bc \\) will be much less than \\((b+c)a\\) or \\( ab+ac \\), so that the third term must also be negative, and therefore in this case only one change of the signs.\n\nIf again the second term be positive, then because the sign of the last term is negative, whatever be the sign of the third term, there can still be no more than one change of the signs.\n\nWhen the equation has two positive roots and one negative, its factors are \\( x-a, x-b, x+c \\), and the equation.\n\n\\[\nx^3 - ax^2 - bx - cx = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere there must always be two changes of the signs; for if \\( a+b \\) be greater than \\( c \\), the second term is negative, and the last term being always positive, there must be two changes, whether the sign of the third term be positive or negative. If again \\( a+b \\) be less than \\( c \\), and therefore the second term positive; it may be shewn as before, that \\( ab \\) is much less than \\( ac+bc \\); and hence the third term will be negative; so that in either case there must be two changes of the signs.\n\nWe may conclude therefore, upon the whole, that in cubic equations there are always as many positive roots, as changes of the signs from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\); and by the same method of reasoning, the rule will be found to extend to all equations whatever.\n\n177. It appears from the manner in which the coefficients of an equation are formed from its roots, that when the roots are all real, the coefficients must consist entirely of real quantities. But it does not follow, on the contrary, that when the coefficients are real, the roots are also real; for we have already found, that in a quadratic equation, \\( x^2 + px + q = 0 \\) where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) denote real quantities, the roots are sometimes both imaginary.\n\n178. When the roots of a quadratic equation are imaginary, they have always this form \\( a + \\sqrt{-b}, a - \\sqrt{-b} \\), which quantities may also be expressed thus,\nLet \\((x-a)(x-b)(x+c)=0\\) be any proposed equation which is to be transformed into another, having its roots greater or less than those of the proposed equation by the given quantity \\(n\\); then, because the roots of the transformed equation are to be \\(+a=n,+b=n\\) and \\(-c=n\\), the equation itself will be \\((y-n-a)(y-n-b)(y-n+c)=0\\).\n\nHence the reason of the following rule is evident.\n\nIf the new equation is to have its roots greater than those of the proposed equation, instead of \\(x\\) and its powers, substitute \\(y-n\\) and its powers; but if the roots are to be less, then instead of \\(x\\) substitute \\(y+n\\); and in either case, a new equation will be produced, the roots of which shall have the property required.\n\n183. By means of the preceding rule, an equation may be changed into another, which has its roots either all positive, or all negative; but it is chiefly useful in preparing cubic and biquadratic equations for a solution, by transforming them into others of the same degrees, but which want their second term.\n\nLet \\(x^3+px^2+qx+r=0\\) be any cubic equation; if we substitute \\(y+n\\) for \\(x\\), the equation is changed into the following:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^3 + 3ny^2 + 3n^2y + n^3 \\\\\n+ p(y^2 + 2ny + n^2) + q(y + n) + r = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow, that this equation may want its second term, it is evident, that we have only to suppose \\(3n+p=0\\), or \\(n=-\\frac{p}{3}\\), for this assumption being made, and the value of \\(n\\) substituted in the remaining terms, the equation becomes\n\n\\[\ny^3 + (q-\\frac{p^2}{3})y + \\frac{2p^3}{27} - \\frac{pq}{3} + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nor, putting \\(\\frac{p^2}{3}+q=q'\\), and \\(\\frac{2p^3}{27}-\\frac{pq}{3}+r=r'\\) the same equation may also stand thus,\n\n\\[\ny^3 + q'y + r' = 0.\n\\]\n\n184. In general, any equation whatever may be transformed into another, which shall want its second term by the following rule.\n\nDivide the coefficient of the second term of the proposed equation by the exponent of the first term, and add the quotient, with its sign changed, to a new unknown quantity; this sum being substituted for the unknown quantity in the proposed equation, a new equation will be produced, which will want the second term, as required.\n\n185. By this rule, any affected quadratic equation may be readily resolved; for by transforming it into another equation, which wants the second term, we thus reduce its solution to that of a pure quadratic. Thus if the quadratic equation \\(x^2-5x+6=0\\) be proposed; by substituting \\(y+\\frac{5}{2}\\) for \\(x\\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^2 + 5y + \\frac{25}{4} \\\\\n- 5y - \\frac{25}{4} \\\\\n+ 6 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad y^2 + \\frac{25}{4} = 0,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(y=\\pm\\frac{5}{2}\\), and since \\(x=y+\\frac{5}{2}\\), therefore \\(x=\\pm\\frac{5}{2}+\\frac{5}{2}=0\\).\n\n186. It has been shewn (\\$169) that in any equation, the coefficient of the second term, having its sign changed, is equal to the sum of all the roots, or abstracting\nALGEBRA.\n\n187. Instead of taking away the second term from an equation, any other term may be made to vanish by an assumption similar to that which has been employed to take away the second term. Thus if in § 183, we assume \\( y^2 + 2py + q = 0 \\), by resolving this quadratic equation, a value of \\( n \\) will be found, which when substituted in the equation, will cause the third term to vanish; and by the resolution of a cubic equation the third term might be taken away; and so on.\n\n188. Another species of transformation, of use in the resolution of equations, is that by which an equation, having the coefficients of some of its terms expressed by fractional quantities, is changed into another, the coefficients of which are all integers.\n\nLet \\( x^3 + \\frac{p}{a}x^2 + \\frac{q}{b}x + \\frac{r}{c} = 0 \\) denote an equation to be so transformed; and let us assume \\( y = abcx \\); and therefore \\( x = \\frac{y}{abc} \\), then by substitution, our equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{a^3b^3c^3} + \\frac{p}{a^2b^2c^2}y^2 + \\frac{q}{abc}y + \\frac{r}{c} = 0\n\\]\n\nand multiplying the whole equation by \\( a^3b^3c^3 \\), we have\n\n\\[\ny^3 + p'y^2 + q'y + r' = 0\n\\]\n\nThus we have an equation free from fractions, while at the same time the coefficient of the highest power of the unknown quantity is unity, as before.\n\n189. This transformation may always be performed by the following rule. Instead of the unknown quantity substitute a new unknown quantity divided by the product of all the denominators; then, by proper reduction, the equation will be found to have the form required.\n\n190. If, however, the equation have this form,\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{p}{a}x^2 + \\frac{q}{a}x + \\frac{r}{a} = 0,\n\\]\n\nit will be sufficient to assume \\( y = ax \\), and therefore \\( x = \\frac{y}{a} \\); for then we have\n\n\\[\ny^3 + py^2 + qy + r = 0\n\\]\n\nAnd \\( y^3 + py^2 + qy + r = 0 \\),\n\nwhich last equation has the form required.\n\nSect. XI. Of Cubic Equations.\n\n191. Cubic equations, as well as equations of every higher degree, are, like quadratics, divided into two classes; they are said to be pure, when they contain only one power of the unknown quantity; and affected, when they contain two or more powers of that quantity.\n\n192. Pure cubic equations are therefore of this form \\( x^3 = 125 \\), or \\( x^3 = -27 \\), or in general \\( x^3 = r \\); and hence it appears, that the value of the simple power of the unknown quantity may always be found, without difficulty, by extracting the cube root of each side of the equation; thus from the first of the three preceding examples we find \\( x = 5 \\), from the second \\( x = -3 \\), and from the third \\( x = \\sqrt[3]{-27} \\).\n\n193. It would seem at first sight, that the only value which \\( x \\) can have in the cubic equation \\( x^3 = r \\), or putting \\( r = c^3 \\), \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\), is this one, \\( x = c \\); but since \\( x^3 - c^3 \\) may be resolved into these two factors \\( x - c \\) and \\( x^2 + cx + c^2 \\), it follows, that besides the value of \\( x \\) already found, which results from making the factor \\( x - c = 0 \\), it has yet other two values, which may be found by making the other factor \\( x^2 + cx + c^2 = 0 \\); and accordingly by resolving the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + cx = -c^2 \\), we find these values to be \\( \\frac{-c + \\sqrt{-3c^2}}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{-c - \\sqrt{-3c^2}}{2} \\), or \\( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\) and \\( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\).\n\nThus it appears that any cubic equation of this form \\( x^3 = c^3 \\), or \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\) has these three roots\n\n\\[\nx = c, \\quad x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c, \\quad x = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c,\n\\]\n\nthe first of which is real, but the two last are imaginary. If, however, each of the imaginary values of \\( x \\) be raised to the third power, the same results will be obtained as from the real value of \\( x \\); the original equation \\( x^3 - c^3 = 0 \\) may also be reproduced, by multiplying together the three factors \\( x - c, x = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c, x = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}c \\).\n\n194. Let us now consider such cubic equations as have all their terms, and which are therefore of this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, \\) and \\( C \\) denote known quantities, either positive or negative.\n\nIt has been shown (§ 184) how an equation having all its terms may be transformed into another, which wants the second term; let us therefore assume \\( x = y - \\frac{A}{3} \\), as directed in that article, then, by proper substitution, the above equation will be changed into another of this form\n\n\\[\ny^3 + qy + r = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) denote known quantities, whether positive or negative, now the roots of this equation being once found, it is evident that those of the former may also be readily obtained by means of the assumed equation \\( x = y - \\frac{A}{3} \\).\n\n195. Resuming, therefore, the equation \\( y^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), let us suppose \\( y = v + z \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\nv^3 + 3v^2z + 3vz^2 + z^3 + qv + rz = 0\n\\]\n\nThus we have got a new equation, which, as it involves two unknown quantities \\( v \\) and \\( z \\), may be resolved into any two other equations, which will simplify the determination of those quantities.\n\nNow it appears, that the only way in which we can divide\nCubic Equations.\n\ndivide that equation into two others, so as to simplify the question, is the following\n\n\\[3v^2z + 3vz^2 + qv + qz = 0\\]\n\n\\[v^3 + z^3 + r = 0\\]\n\nThe first of these equations may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[(3vz + q)(v + z) = 0\\]\n\nHence we must either suppose that \\(v + z = 0\\), or that \\(3vz + q = 0\\); but the former supposition cannot be admitted, without supposing also that \\(y = 0\\), which does not agree with the hypothesis of the equation \\(y^3 + gy + r = 0\\); therefore we must adopt the latter. So that to determine \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) we have these two equations\n\n\\[3vz + q = 0, \\quad v^3 + z^3 + r = 0.\\]\n\nFrom the first, we find \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3}\\), and \\(v^3z^3 = -\\frac{q^3}{27}\\);\n\nand from the second \\(v^3 + z^3 = -r\\), so that to determine the quantities \\(v^3\\) and \\(z^3\\), we have given their sum, and product; now this is a problem which we have already resolved when treating of quadratic equations, §155; and by proceeding in the same manner, in the present case, we shall find\n\n\\[v^3 = -\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}, \\quad z^3 = -\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3},\\]\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}.\\]\n\nand \\(y = v + z = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}} + \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}}.\\)\n\nThus we have at last obtained a value of the unknown quantity \\(y\\), in terms of the known quantities \\(q\\) and \\(r\\); therefore the equation is resolved.\n\n196. But this is only one of three values which \\(y\\) may have; let us, for the sake of brevity, put\n\n\\[A = -\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}, \\quad B = -\\frac{1}{2}r - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3},\\]\n\nand denote the imaginary expressions\n\n\\[\\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\]\n\nby \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\). Then, from what has been shewn (§193), it is evident that \\(v\\) and \\(z\\) have each these three values\n\n\\[v = \\sqrt[3]{A}, \\quad v = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A}, \\quad v = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A},\\]\n\n\\[z = \\sqrt[3]{B}, \\quad z = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}, \\quad z = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nTo determine the corresponding values of \\(v\\) and \\(z\\), we must consider that \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3} = \\sqrt{AB}\\); now if we observe that \\(\\alpha \\beta = 1\\), it will immediately appear that \\(v + z\\) has these three values\n\n\\[v + z = \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[v + z = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[v + z = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nHence the three values of \\(y\\) are also these\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\beta \\sqrt[3]{B},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} + \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{B}.\\]\n\nThe first of these formulae is commonly known by the name of Cardan's rule; but it is well known that Cardan was not the inventor, and that it ought to be attributed to Nicholas Tartalea, and Scipio Ferreus, who discovered it much about the same time, and independently of each other (see the Introduction.)\n\n197. The formulae given in last article for the roots of a cubic equation may be put under a different form, and perhaps better adapted to the purposes of arithmetical calculation as follows. Because \\(vz = -\\frac{q}{3}\\),\n\ntherefore \\(z = -\\frac{q}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{v} = -\\frac{q}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{A}}\\); hence \\(v + z = \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}}\\); thus it appears that the three values of \\(y\\) may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[y = \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\alpha \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}},\\]\n\n\\[y = \\beta \\sqrt[3]{A} - \\frac{q}{3 \\sqrt[3]{A}}.\\]\n\n198. To show the manner of applying these formulae, let it be required to determine \\(x\\) from the cubic equation\n\n\\[x^3 + 3x^2 + 9x - 13 = 0.\\]\n\nAnd as this equation has all its terms, the first step towards its resolution is to transform it into another which shall want the second term, by substituting \\(y = 1\\) for \\(x\\) as directed (§184). The operation will stand thus\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nx^3 &= y^3 - 3y^2 + 3y - 1 \\\\\n+ 3x^2 &= + 3y^2 - 6y + 3 \\\\\n+ 9x &= + 9y - 9 \\\\\n- 13 &= - 13\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nThe transformed equation is \\(y^3 + 6y - 20 = 0\\),\n\nwhich being compared with the general equation\n\n\\[y^3 + gy + r = 0\\]\n\ngives \\(g = 6, r = -20\\); hence\n\n\\[A = \\sqrt{-\\frac{1}{2}r + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}r^2 + \\frac{1}{27}q^3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}}.\\]\n\nTherefore, the first formula of last article gives \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}} - \\frac{2}{3 \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}}}\\); but as this expression involves a radical quantity, let the square root of 108 be taken and added to 10, and the cube root of the sum found; thus we have \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{10}{3} + \\sqrt{\\frac{108}{3}}} = 2.732\\), nearly, and...\nCubic Equations, and therefore \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{108}} = \\frac{2}{2.732} = .732 \\); hence we at last find one of the values of \\( y \\) to be \\( 2.732 - .732 = 2 \\).\n\nIn finding the cube root of the radical quantity \\( \\sqrt[3]{10 + \\sqrt{108}} \\) we have taken only its approximate value, so as to have the expression for the root under a rational form, and in this way we can always find, as near as we please, the cube root of any furd of the form \\( a + \\sqrt{b} \\) where \\( b \\) is a positive number. But it will sometimes happen that the cube root of such a furd can be expressed exactly by another furd of the same form; and accordingly, in the present case, it appears that the cube root of \\( 10 + \\sqrt{108} \\) is \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\), as may be proved by actually raising \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\) to the third power. Hence we find \\( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10} + \\sqrt{108}} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2(1 - \\sqrt{3})}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})(1 - \\sqrt{3})} = -(1 - \\sqrt{3}) \\); so that we have \\( y = 1 + \\sqrt{3} + 1 - \\sqrt{3} = 2 \\), as before.\n\nThe other two values of \\( y \\) will be had by substituting \\( 1 + \\sqrt{3} \\) and \\( 1 - \\sqrt{3} \\) for \\( \\sqrt[3]{A} \\) and \\( \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{A}}{2} \\) in the second and third formulae of last article, also restoring the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). We thus have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-9}}{2} \\times (1 + \\sqrt{3}) + \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-9}}{2} \\times (1 - \\sqrt{3})\n\\]\n\nSo that the three values of \\( y \\) are\n\n\\[\n+2, -1 + \\sqrt{-9}, -1 - \\sqrt{-9}\n\\]\n\nand since \\( x = y + 1 \\), the corresponding values of \\( x \\) are\n\n\\[\n+1, -2 + \\sqrt{-9}, -2 - \\sqrt{-9}\n\\]\n\nthus it appears that one of the roots of the proposed equation is real and the other two imaginary.\n\nThe two imaginary roots might have been found otherwise, by considering that since one root of the equation is \\( 1 \\), the equation must be divisible by \\( x - r \\) (\\$163). Accordingly the division being actually performed, and the quotient put \\( = 0 \\), we have this quadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 4x + 13 = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich, when resolved by the rule for quadratics, gives \\( x = -2 \\pm \\sqrt{-9} \\), the same imaginary values as before.\n\n199. In the application of the preceding formulæ (\\$196 and 197) to the resolution of the equation \\( y^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), it is necessary to find the square root of \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} + \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); now when that quantity is positive, as in the equation \\( y^3 + 6y - 20 = 0 \\), which was resolved in last article, no difficulty occurs, for its root may be found, either exactly, or to as great a degree of accuracy as we please.\n\nAs, however, the coefficients \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) are independent of each other, it is evident that \\( q \\) may be negative, and such that \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) is greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); in this case the expression \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} + \\frac{r^2}{4} \\) will be negative, and therefore its square root an imaginary quantity. Let us take as an example this equation \\( y^3 - 6y + 4 = 0 \\); here \\( q = -6 \\), \\( r = 4 \\), \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} = 9 \\), \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} = 1 \\), hence, by recurring to the formulæ (\\$196), we have \\( A = 2 + 2\\sqrt{-1} \\), \\( B = 2 - \\sqrt{-1} \\), and therefore the three roots of the equation expressed thus\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{-1}}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - 2\\sqrt{-1}}}\n\\]\n\nHere all the roots appear under an imaginary form; but we are certain from the theory of equations as explained in Sect. X. that every cubic equation must have at least one real root. The truth is, as we shall show immediately, that in this case, so far from any of the roots being imaginary (as in the former example), they are all real; for it appears by actual involution that the imaginary expression \\( 2 + 2\\sqrt{-1} \\) is the cube of this other imaginary expression \\( -1 + \\sqrt{-1} \\), and, in like manner, that \\( 2 - 2\\sqrt{-1} \\) is the cube of \\( -1 - \\sqrt{-1} \\), so that we have\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 + 2\\sqrt{-1}}} + \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - 2\\sqrt{-1}}} = -1 + \\sqrt{-1}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 + \\sqrt{-1}) + \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 - \\sqrt{-1}) = 1 + \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 + \\sqrt{-1}) + \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2} \\times (-1 - \\sqrt{-1}) = 1 - \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n200. We now proceed to prove in general, that as often as the roots of the equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\) are real, \\( q \\) is negative, and \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\); and, on the contrary, that if \\( \\frac{q^2}{4} \\) be greater than \\( \\frac{r^2}{4} \\) the roots are all real.\n\nLet us suppose \\( a \\) to be a real root of the proposed equation,\n\nThen \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\)\n\nAnd \\( a^3 + qa + r = 0 \\)\n\nAnd therefore by subtraction \\( x^3 - a^3 + q(x-a) = 0 \\); hence, dividing \\( x^3 - a^3 \\), also \\( q(x-a) \\) by \\( x-a \\), we have\n\n\\[\nx^2 + ax + a^2 + q = 0\n\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation is formed from the two remaining roots of the proposed equation, and by resolving it we find\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{a}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} - q}\n\\]\n\nAnd as, by hypothesis, all the roots are real, it is evident that \\( q \\) must necessarily be negative, and greater than \\( \\frac{a^2}{4} \\); for otherwise the expression \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} - q} \\) would be imaginary. Let us change the sign of \\( q \\), and put\nCubic Equations.\n\nPut \\( q = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d \\); thus the roots of the equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\) will be\n\n\\[\na, -\\frac{1}{2}a + \\sqrt{d}, -\\frac{1}{2}a - \\sqrt{d},\n\\]\n\nand here \\( d \\) is a positive quantity.\n\nTo find an expression for \\( r \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), let \\( \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d \\) be substituted for \\( q \\) in the equation \\( a^3 + qa + r = 0 \\); we thence find \\( r = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + ad \\); so that to compare together the quantities \\( q \\) and \\( r \\) we have these equations,\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + d,\n\\]\n\\[\nr = \\frac{1}{4}a^3 + ad.\n\\]\n\nIn order to make this comparison, let the cube of \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) be taken, also the square of \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\), the results are\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{4}q \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{1}{4}r \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{16}a^6 + \\frac{1}{8}a^3d + \\frac{1}{16}d^2,\n\\]\n\nand therefore, by subtraction,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3 - \\frac{1}{16}a^6 - \\frac{1}{8}a^3d - \\frac{1}{16}d^2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nNow the square of any real quantity being always positive, it follows that \\( \\frac{1}{64}a^9 + \\frac{3}{64}a^6d + \\frac{3}{64}a^3d^2 + \\frac{1}{64}d^3 \\) will be positive when \\( d \\) is positive; hence it is evident that in this case \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) must be greater than \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\); and that the contrary cannot be true unless \\( d \\) be negative, that is, unless that \\( -\\frac{1}{2}a + \\sqrt{d}, -\\frac{1}{2}a - \\sqrt{d} \\), the two other roots of the equation, are imaginary. If we suppose \\( d = 0 \\), then \\( \\frac{1}{4}q = \\frac{1}{4}r \\), and the roots of the equations, which in this case are all real, are \\( a, -\\frac{1}{2}a, -\\frac{1}{2}a \\).\n\nUpon the whole, therefore, we infer, that since a cubic equation has always one real root, its roots will be all real as often as \\( q \\) is negative, and \\( \\frac{1}{4}q \\) greater than \\( \\frac{1}{4}r \\); and consequently, that in this case the formulae for the roots must express real quantities notwithstanding their imaginary form.\n\nLet \\( y^3 - gy + r = 0 \\) denote any equation of the form which has been considered in last article, namely, that which has its roots all real, then, if we put \\( a = -\\frac{1}{2}r \\), \\( b = \\frac{1}{4}q^3 - \\frac{1}{2}r^2 \\), one of the roots, as expressed by the first formula, § 196, will be\n\n\\[\ny = \\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}}.\n\\]\n\nThis expression, although under an imaginary form, must (as we have shown in last article) represent a real quantity. It will sometimes happen, as in last example, § 199, that the two surds which compose the root are perfect cubes of the form \\( (A + B\\sqrt{-1})^3 \\) and \\( (A - B\\sqrt{-1})^3 \\), and then the value of \\( y \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nA + B\\sqrt{-1} + A - B\\sqrt{-1} = 2A.\n\\]\n\nBut the rules for determining when this is the case depend upon trials, and are besides troublesome in the application. And if we attempt by a direct process to investigate the numerical values of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we are brought to a cubic equation, of the very same form as that whose root is required.\n\nThis imaginary expression for a real quantity has greatly perplexed mathematicians; and much pains has been taken to obtain the root under another form, but without success. Accordingly the case of cubic equations, in which the roots are all real, is now called the irreducible case.\n\nIt is remarkable that the expression\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}},\n\\]\n\nand in general,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}},\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is any power of 2, admits of being reduced to another form in which no impossible quantity is found.\n\nThus \\( \\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}} = \\sqrt[3]{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \\),\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{a + b\\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt[3]{a - b\\sqrt{-1}} = \\sqrt{\\left( \\sqrt{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\right)^3},\n\\]\n\nas is easily proved by first squaring the imaginary formulae, and then taking the square root of each. But when \\( n = 3 \\), it does not seem that such reduction can possibly take place.\n\nIf each of the surds be expanded into an infinite series and their sum be taken, the imaginary quantity \\( \\sqrt{-1} \\) will vanish; and thus the root may be found by a direct process. There are, however, other methods which seem preferable, and the following which is derived from the application of algebra to geometry seems to be the best.\n\nIt will be demonstrated in Sect. XXV, that if \\( a \\) denote an arch of a circle, the relation between the cosine of the arch and the cosine of \\( \\frac{a}{3} \\), one-third of that arch is expressed by the following cubic equation.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cof. } \\frac{a}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} = \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nLet us assume \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{a}{3} = \\frac{y}{n} \\); then, by substitution, the equation is transformed into the following\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{n^3} - \\frac{3y}{4n} = \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nOr\n\n\\[\ny^3 - \\frac{3y^3}{4} = n^3 \\times \\text{ cof. } a.\n\\]\n\nAnd in this cubic equation one of the roots is evidently \\( y = n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} \\). Now from the arithmetic of sines it appears that \\( \\text{cof. } a, \\text{ cof. } (360^\\circ - a) \\) and \\( \\text{cof. } (360^\\circ + a) \\) are all expressed by the same quantity; therefore the equation must have for a root, not only \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3} \\), but also \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ - a}{3} \\), and \\( n \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ + a}{3} \\). But from the arithmetic of sines \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ - a}{3} = \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3} \\), and \\( \\text{cof. } \\frac{360^\\circ + a}{3} = \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3} \\). Therefore the three roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\nn \\times \\text{ cof. } \\frac{a}{3}, -n \\times \\text{ fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}, -n \\times \\text{ fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}.\n\\]\n\nLet us next suppose that \\( y^3 - gy + r = 0 \\) is a cubic equa-\nCubic Equations whose roots are required, and let us compare it with the former equation \\( y^3 - \\frac{3n^2}{4} y = n^3 \\times \\text{cof. } a; \\) then it is evident that if we assume the quantities \\( n \\) and cof. \\( a \\), such that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3n^2}{4} = q, \\quad n^3 \\times \\text{cof. } a = r\n\\]\n\nthe two equations will become identical, and thus their roots will be expressed by the very same quantities. But from these two assumed equations we find\n\n\\[\nn = \\sqrt{\\frac{4q}{3}}, \\quad \\text{cof. } a = \\frac{r}{n^3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{27r^2}{4q^3}} = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}}\n\\]\n\nand since the cosine of an arch cannot exceed unity, therefore, \\( \\frac{27r^2}{4q^3} \\) must be a proper fraction, that is \\( 4q^3 \\) must exceed \\( 27r^2 \\); or \\( \\frac{27}{4} q^3 \\) must exceed \\( \\frac{3}{4} r^2 \\); if we now recollect that \\( q \\) is a negative quantity it will immediately appear that the proposed equation must necessarily belong to the irreducible case.\n\n206. The rule, therefore which we derive from the preceding analysis for resolving that case is as follows:\n\nLet \\( y^3 - qy = r \\) be the proposed equation.\n\nFind in the trigonometrical tables an arch \\( a \\), whose natural cosine \\( = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} \\).\n\nThe roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}\n\\]\n\nThese formulæ will apply, whether \\( r \\) be positive or negative, by proper attention to the signs: If, however, \\( r \\) be negative, or the equation have this form, \\( y^3 - qy = -r \\), the following will be more convenient:\n\nFind in the tables an arch \\( a \\), whose fine \\( = \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} \\).\n\nThen the roots of the equation are\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{fin. } \\frac{a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{90^\\circ + a}{3}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = -2\\sqrt{\\frac{q}{3}} \\times \\text{cof. } \\frac{90^\\circ - a}{3}\n\\]\n\nThe last formulæ are derived from the equation\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\text{fin. } \\frac{a}{3} \\right) = \\text{fin. } a\n\\]\n\nin the same manner as the former were found from the first equation of last article.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to find the roots of the equation \\( x^3 - 3x = 1 \\).\n\nHere \\( \\frac{3r\\sqrt{3}}{2q\\sqrt{q}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{6\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{2} = \\text{cof. } 60^\\circ = \\text{cof. } \\pi \\).\n\nHence\n\n\\[\nx = 2 \\text{ cof. } \\frac{60^\\circ}{3} = 2 \\text{ cof. } 20^\\circ = 1.8793852\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -2 \\text{ fin. } \\frac{150^\\circ}{3} = -2 \\text{ fin. } 50^\\circ = -1.5320888\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = -2 \\text{ fin. } \\frac{30^\\circ}{3} = -2 \\text{ fin. } 10^\\circ = -0.3472964\n\\]\n\nEx. 2.

XII. Of Biquadratic Equations.\n\n207. When a biquadratic equation contains all its terms, it has this form,\n\n\\[\nx^4 + A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D = 0\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, D \\), denote any known quantities whatever.\n\n208. We shall first consider pure biquadratics, or such as contain only the first and last terms, and therefore are of this form \\( x^4 = b^4 \\). In this case it is evident that \\( x \\) may be readily had by two extractions of the square root; by the first we find \\( x^2 = b^2 \\) and by the second \\( x = b \\). This, however, is only one of the values which \\( x \\) may have; for since \\( x^4 = b^4 \\), therefore \\( x^4 - b^4 = 0 \\); but \\( x^4 - b^4 \\) may be resolved into two factors \\( x^2 - b^2 \\) and \\( x^2 + b^2 \\), each of which admit of a similar resolution; for \\( x^2 - b^2 = (x - b)(x + b) \\) and \\( x^2 + b^2 = (x - b\\sqrt{-1})(x + b\\sqrt{-1}) \\). Hence it appears that the equation \\( x^4 - b^4 = 0 \\) may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[\n(x - b)(x + b)(x - b\\sqrt{-1})(x + b\\sqrt{-1}) = 0,\n\\]\n\nso that \\( x \\) may have these four values,\n\n\\[\n\\pm b, \\pm b\\sqrt{-1},\n\\]\n\ntwo of which are real and the others imaginary.\n\n209. Next to pure biquadratic equations, in respect of easiness of resolution, are such as want the second and fourth terms, and therefore have this form,\n\n\\[\nx^4 + q x^2 + s = 0.\n\\]\n\nThese may be resolved in the manner of quadratic equations; for if we put \\( y^2 = x^2 \\) we have\n\n\\[\ny^4 + q y^2 + s = 0,\n\\]\n\nfrom which we find \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-q \\pm \\sqrt{q^2 - 4s}}{2}} \\), and therefore \\( x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-q \\pm \\sqrt{q^2 - 4s}}{2}} \\).\n\n210. When a biquadratic equation has all its terms, the manner of resolving it is not so obvious as in the two former cases, but its resolution may be always reduced to that of a cubic equation. There are various methods by which such a reduction may be effected; the following, which we select as one of the most ingenious, was first given by Euler in the Peterburgh Commentaries, and\nBiquadratic and afterwards explained more fully in his Elements of Algebra.\n\nWe have already explained § 184, in what manner an equation which is complete in its terms may be transformed into another equation of the same degree, but which wants the second term; therefore, any proposed biquadratic equation may be reduced to this form,\n\n\\[ y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\]\n\nwhere the second term is wanting, and where \\( p, q, r \\) denote any known quantities whatever.\n\n211. That we may form any equation similar to the above, let us assume \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\), and let us also suppose that the letters \\( a, b, c \\) denote the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + Pz^2 + Qz - R = 0 \\]\n\nthen from the theory of equations we have\n\n\\[ a + b + c = -P, \\quad ab + ac + bc = Q, \\quad abc = R. \\]\n\nLet us now square the assumed formula\n\n\\[ y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}, \\]\n\nand we obtain\n\n\\[ y^2 = a + b + c + 2(\\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt{ac} + \\sqrt{bc}) \\]\n\nor substituting \\(-P\\) for \\(a + b + c\\), and transposing,\n\n\\[ y^2 + P = 2(\\sqrt{ab} + \\sqrt{ac} + \\sqrt{bc}). \\]\n\nLet this equation be also squared and we have\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 + P^2 = 4(ab + ac + bc) + 8(\\sqrt{abc} + \\sqrt{ab^2c} + \\sqrt{a^2bc} + \\sqrt{a^2b^2c}), \\]\n\nand since \\( ab + ac + bc = Q \\),\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 + P^2 = 4Q + 8\\sqrt{Ry}. \\]\n\nThus we have obtained the biquadratic equation\n\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 - 8\\sqrt{Ry} + P^2 - 4Q = 0, \\]\n\none of the roots of which \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\), and in which \\( a, b, c \\) are the roots of the cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + Pz^2 + Qz - R = 0. \\]\n\n212. That we may apply this resolution to the proposed equation \\( y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\), we must express the assumed coefficients \\( P, Q, R \\) by means of \\( p, q, r \\) the coefficients of that equation. For this purpose let us compare together the equations;\n\n\\[ y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\]\n\\[ y^4 + 2Py^2 - 8\\sqrt{Ry} + P^2 - 4Q = 0, \\]\n\nand it immediately appears that \\( 2P = p, -8\\sqrt{R} = q, P^2 - 4Q = r \\); and from these three equations we find\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{p}{2}, \\quad Q = \\frac{p^2 - 4r}{16}, \\quad R = \\frac{q^2}{64}. \\]\n\nHence it follows, that the roots of the proposed equation are generally expressed by the formula \\( y = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\); where \\( a, b, c \\) denote the roots of this cubic equation\n\n\\[ z^3 + \\frac{P}{2}z^2 + \\frac{P^2 - 4r}{16}z - \\frac{q^2}{64} = 0. \\]\n\n213. But to find each particular root, we must consider, that as the square root of a number may be either positive or negative, so each of the quantities \\( \\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c} \\) may have either the sign \\(+ \\) or \\(- \\) prefixed to it; and hence our formula will give eight different expressions for the root. It is, however, to be observed, that as the product of the three quantities \\( \\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{c} \\) must be equal to \\( \\sqrt{R} \\) or to \\(-\\frac{q^2}{8} \\), therefore when \\( q \\) is positive, their product must be a negative quantity; and this can only be effected by making either one or three of them negative; again, when \\( q \\) is negative, their product must be a positive quantity, so that in this case they must either be all positive, or two of them must be negative. These considerations enable us to determine, that four of the eight expressions for the root belong to the case in which \\( q \\) is positive, and the other four to that in which it is negative.\n\n214. We shall now give the result of the preceding investigation, in the form of a practical rule, for resolving biquadratic equations; and as the coefficients of the cubic equation which has been found, § 212, involve fractions, we shall transform it into another, in which the coefficients are integers, by supposing\n\n\\[ z = \\frac{v}{4}. \\]\n\nThus the equation \\( z^3 + \\frac{P}{2}z^2 + \\frac{P^2 - 4r}{16}z - \\frac{q^2}{64} = 0 \\) becomes, after reduction, \\( v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0 \\);\n\nit also follows, that since the roots of the former equation are \\( a, b, c \\), the roots of the latter are \\( \\frac{a}{4}, \\frac{b}{4}, \\frac{c}{4} \\), so that our rule may now be expressed thus:\n\nLet \\( y^4 + py^3 + qy + r = 0 \\) be any biquadratic equation wanting its second term. Form this cubic equation\n\n\\[ v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0, \\]\n\nand find its roots, which let us denote by \\( a, b, c \\).\n\nThen the roots of the proposed biquadratic equation are\n\nwhen \\( q \\) is negative\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} - \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} - \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}). \\]\n\nwhen \\( q \\) is positive\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\]\n\\[ y = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}). \\]\n\n215. This resolution of biquadratic equations suggests the following general remarks upon the nature of their roots.\n\n1. It is evident from the form of the roots, that if the cubic equation\n\n\\[ v^3 + 2pv^2 + (p^2 - 4r)v - q^2 = 0 \\]\n\nhave all its roots real, and positive, those of the biquadratic equation shall be all real.\n\n2. Since the last term of the cubic equation is negative, when its three roots are real, they must either be all positive, or two of them must be negative and one positive; for the last term is equal to the product of all the roots taken with contrary signs, § 169; so that in this last case two of the three quantities \\( a, b, c \\) must be negative, and therefore all the four roots of the biquadratic equation imaginary. If, however, the two negative roots be equal, they will destroy each other in two of the roots of the biquadratic equation, which will then become real and equal. Let us suppose for example that \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) are negative, and equal; the two first values of \\( y \\) in each column become then imaginary,\nBiquadratic, and the remaining values of \\( y \\) are in the first set of roots \\( y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a}, y = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a} \\), and in the second \\( y = +\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a}, y = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{a} \\).\n\n3. When the cubic equation has only one real, and two imaginary roots, its real root must necessarily be positive. For the imaginary roots can only come from a quadratic equation, having its last term positive, Sect. IX, and therefore of this form \\( v^2 + Av + B = 0 \\), hence, the simple factor which contains the remaining root must have this form \\( v - r \\), otherwise the last term of the cubic equation could not be negative.\n\nBy resolving the equation \\( v^3 + Av + B = 0 \\), we find\n\n\\[ v = -\\frac{A}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2}{4} - B}; \\]\n\nhere, the roots being supposed imaginary, \\( \\frac{A^2}{4} - B \\) must be a negative quantity. That we may simplify the form of the roots, let us put \\( -\\frac{A}{2} = a \\) and \\( \\frac{A^2}{4} - B = -\\beta^2 \\); then\n\n\\[ v = -a \\pm \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad v = -a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}. \\]\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[ a = a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad b = a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}, \\quad c = r; \\]\n\nso that in two of the four values of \\( y \\), we have a quantity of this form\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} + \\sqrt{a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} \\]\n\nbut this quantity, although it appears to be imaginary, is indeed real; for if we first square it, and then take its square root, it becomes\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2a + 2\\sqrt{a^2 + \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nwhich is a real quantity. The two other roots involve this other expression\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{a + \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} - \\sqrt{a - \\beta \\sqrt{-1}} \\]\n\nwhich, being treated in the same manner as the former, becomes\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{2a - 2\\sqrt{a^2 + \\beta^2}} \\]\n\nan imaginary quantity, and therefore the roots, into which it enters, are imaginary.\n\n4. We may discover from the coefficients of the proposed biquadratic equation in what case the roots of the cubic equation are all real; for this purpose the latter is to be transformed into another which shall want the second term by assuming \\( v = u - \\frac{2p}{3} \\); thus it becomes\n\n\\[ u^3 - \\left( \\frac{p^2}{3} + 4r \\right) u - \\frac{2p^3}{27} + \\frac{8rp}{3} - q^2 = 0; \\]\n\nand in this equation the three roots will be real when\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{p^2}{3} + 4r \\right)^3 \\text{ is greater than } \\frac{4}{27} \\left( \\frac{2p^3}{27} - \\frac{8rp}{3} + q^2 \\right). \\]\n\n216. As an example of the method of resolving a biquadratic equation, let it be required to determine the roots of the following,\n\n\\[ x^4 - 25x^3 + 65x - 36 = 0. \\]\n\nVol. I. Part II.\n\nBy comparing this equation with the general formula, Reciprocal Equations, we have \\( p = -25, q = +65, r = -36 \\), hence\n\n\\[ 2p = -50, p^2 - 4r = 769, q^2 = 3600, \\]\n\nand the cubic equation to be resolved is\n\n\\[ v^3 - 50v^2 + 769v - 3600 = 0; \\]\n\nthe roots of which are found by the rules for cubics, to be 9, 16, and 25, so that we have \\( \\sqrt{a} = 3, \\sqrt{b} = 4, \\sqrt{c} = 5 \\). Now in this case \\( q \\) is positive, therefore\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{(-3 - 4 - 5)}{-6} = 6 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(-3 + 4 + 5)}{+3} = 3 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(3 - 4 - 5)}{-2} = 2 \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{(3 + 4 - 5)}{+1} = 1. \\]\n\n217. We have now explained the particular rules by which the roots of equations belonging to each of the first four orders may be determined; and this is the greatest length mathematicians have been able to go in the direct resolution of equations; for as to those of the fifth, and all higher degrees, no general method has hitherto been found, either for resolving them directly, or for reducing them to others of an inferior degree.\n\nIt even appears that the formulæ which express the roots of cubic equations are by no means of universal application; for in one case, that is, when the roots are all real, they become illusory, so that no conclusion can be drawn from them. The same observation will also apply to the formulæ for the roots of biquadratic equations, because, before they can be applied, it is always necessary to find the roots of a cubic equation. But in either cubics or biquadratic equations, even when the formulæ involve no imaginary quantities, and therefore can be always applied, it is more convenient in practice to employ some other methods which we are hereafter to explain.\n\nSect. XIII. Of Reciprocal Equations.\n\n218. Although no general resolution has hitherto been given of equations belonging to the fifth, or any higher degree; yet there are particular equations of all orders, which by reason of certain peculiarities in the nature of their roots, admit of being reduced to others of a lower degree, and thus, in some cases, equations of the higher orders may be resolved by the rules which have been already explained for the resolution of equations belonging to the first four orders.\n\n219. When the coefficients of the terms of an equation form the same numerical series, whether taken in a direct or an inverted order, as in this example\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nthat equation may always be transformed into another of a degree denoted by half the exponent of the highest power of the unknown quantity, if that exponent be an even number, or by half the exponent diminished by unity, if it be an odd number.\n\nThe same observation will also apply to any equation of this form\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwhere the given quantity \\( a \\) and the unknown quantity \\( x \\) are\nReciprocal \\( x \\) are precisely alike concerned; for by substituting \\( ay \\) for \\( x \\), it becomes\n\n\\[\na^4 + p a^3 y + q a^2 y^2 + p a y^3 + a^4 = 0;\n\\]\n\nand dividing by \\( a^4 \\),\n\n\\[\ny^4 + p y^3 + q y^2 + p y + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nan equation of the same kind as the former.\n\n220. That we may effect the proposed transformation upon the equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nlet every two terms which are equally distant from the extremes be collected into one, and the whole be divided by \\( x^4 \\), thus we have\n\n\\[\nx^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} + p \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + q = 0.\n\\]\n\nLet us assume \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\)\n\nThen \\( x^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = z^2 \\) and \\( x^2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = z^2 - 2 \\)\n\nThus the equation \\( x^4 + \\frac{1}{x^4} + p \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + q = 0 \\)\n\nbecomes \\( z^4 + p z^2 + q - 2 = 0 \\).\n\nAnd since \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\), therefore \\( x^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \\).\n\n221. Hence upon the whole, to determine the roots of the biquadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nwe have the following rule.\n\nForm this quadratic equation\n\n\\[\nz^4 + p z^2 + q - 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nand find its roots, which let us suppose denoted by \\( z' \\) and \\( z'' \\). Then the four roots of the proposed equation will be found by resolving two quadratic equations\n\n\\[\nx^2 - z' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z'' x + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\n222. It may be observed respecting these two quadratic equations, that since the last term of each is unity, if we put \\( a, a' \\) to denote the roots of the one, and \\( b, b' \\) those of the other, we have from the theory of equations \\( a a' = 1 \\), and therefore \\( a' = \\frac{1}{a} \\); also \\( b b' = 1 \\), and \\( b' = \\frac{1}{b} \\); now \\( a, a', b, b' \\) are also the roots of the equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + p x + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears that the proposed equation has this peculiar property, that the one half of its roots are the reciprocals of the other half; and to that circumstance we are indebted for the simplicity of its resolution.\n\n223. The following equation\n\n\\[\nx^6 + p x^5 + q x^4 + r x^3 + s x^2 + p x + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich is of the sixth order, admits of a resolution in all respects similar to the former; for by putting it under this form\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} + p \\left( x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} \\right) + q \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) + r = 0,\n\\]\n\nand putting also \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = z \\), so that \\( x^2 - xz + 1 = 0 \\), we with equal roots.\n\nhave \\( x^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = z^3 - 2 \\)\n\n\\[\nx^3 + \\frac{1}{x^3} = z^3 - 3 \\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = z^3 - 3z\n\\]\n\nHence, by substitution, the proposed equation is transformed into the following cubic equation\n\n\\[\nz^3 + p z^2 + (q - 3) z + r - 2p = 0.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, putting \\( z', z'', z''' \\) to denote its roots, the six roots of the proposed equation will be had by resolving these three quadratics\n\n\\[\nx^2 - z' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z'' x + 1 = 0, \\quad x^2 - z''' x + 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nand here it is evident, as in the former case, that the roots of each quadratic equation are the reciprocals of each other, so that the one half of the roots of the proposed equation are the reciprocals of the other half.\n\n224. The method of resolution we have employed in the two preceding examples is general for all equations whatever, in which the terms placed at equal distances from the first and last have the same coefficients, and which are called reciprocal equations, because any such equation has the same form when you substitute for \\( x \\) its reciprocal \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\n225. If the greatest exponent of the unknown quantity in a reciprocal equation is an odd number, as in this example\n\n\\[\nx^5 + p x^4 + q x^3 + r x^2 + p x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nthe equation will always be satisfied by substituting \\(-1\\) for \\( x \\); hence \\(-1\\) must be a root of the equation, and therefore the equation must be divisible by \\( x + 1 \\).\n\nAccordingly, if the division be actually performed, we shall have in the present case\n\n\\[\nx^4 + (p - 1)x^3 + (q - p - 1)x^2 + (r - q - p)x + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nanother reciprocal equation, in which the greatest exponent of \\( x \\) is an even number, and therefore resolvable in the manner we have already explained.\n\nSect. XIV. Of Equations which have Equal Roots.\n\n226. When an equation has two or more of its roots equal to one another, those roots may always be discovered, and the equation reduced to another of an inferior degree, by a method of resolution which is peculiar to this class of equations; and which we now proceed to explain.\n\n227. Although the method of resolution we are to employ will apply alike to equations having equal roots, of every degree, yet, for the sake of brevity, we shall take a biquadratic equation\n\n\\[\nx^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + r x + s = 0\n\\]\n\nthe roots of which may be generally denoted by \\( a, b, c, d \\). Thus we have, from the theory of equations,\n\n\\[\n(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d) = x^4 + p x^3 + q x^2 + r x + s\n\\]\n\nLet us put\n\n\\[\nA = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c) \\quad A'' = (x-a)(x-c)(x-d)\n\\]\n\\[\nA' = (x-a)(x-b)(x-d) \\quad A''' = (x-b)(x-c)(x-d)\n\\]\n\nThen,\nThen, by actual multiplication, we have\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA &= x^3 - ax + ab \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bc \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA' &= x^3 - ax + ab \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA'' &= x^3 - ax + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\nA''' &= x^3 - ax + ac \\\\\n&= x^3 - bx + ad \\\\\n&= x^3 - cx + bd \\\\\n\\end{align*} \\]\n\nand taking the sum of these four equations\n\n\\[ A + A' + A'' + A''' = 4x^3 - 3ax + 2ab + 2ac + 2ad + 2bd + 2cd \\]\n\nBut since \\(a, b, c, d\\) are the roots of the equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[ 3(a + b + c + d) = 3p \\]\n\\[ 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) = 2q \\]\n\\[ -(abc + abd + acd + bcd) = r \\]\n\nTherefore, by substitution\n\n\\[ A + A' + A'' + A''' = 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r \\]\n\n228. Let us now suppose that the proposed biquadratic equation has two equal roots, or \\(a = b\\), then \\(x = a = -b\\), and since one or other of these equal factors enters each of the four products \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\); it is evident that \\(A + A' + A'' + A'''\\) or \\(4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r\\) must be divisible by \\(x - a\\) or \\(x - b\\). Thus it appears that if the proposed equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nhas two equal roots, each of them must also be a root of this equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0; \\]\n\nfor when the first of these equations is divisible by \\((x - a)^n\\) the latter is necessarily divisible by \\(x - a\\).\n\n229. Let us next suppose that the proposed equation has three equal roots or \\(a = b = c\\), then two at least of the three equal factors \\(x - a, x - b, x - c\\) must enter each of the four products \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\); so that in this case \\(A + A' + A'' + A'''\\) or \\(4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r\\) must be twice divisible by \\(x - a\\). Hence it follows that as often as the proposed equation has three equal roots, two of them must also be equal roots of the equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0 \\]\n\n230. Proceeding in the same manner, it may be shewn that whatever number of equal roots are in the proposed equation\n\n\\[ x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0 \\]\n\nthey will all remain except one, in this equation\n\n\\[ 4x^3 + 3px^2 + 2qx + r = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is evidently derived from the former, by multiplying each of its terms by the exponent of \\(x\\) in that with equal term, and then diminishing the exponent by unity.\n\n231. If we suppose that the proposed equation has two equal roots or \\(a = b\\), and also two other equal roots, or \\(c = d\\), then, by reasoning as before, it will appear that the equation derived from it must have one root equal to \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), and another equal to \\(c\\) or \\(d\\), so that when the former is divisible both by \\((x - a)^n\\) and \\((x - c)^m\\), the latter will be divisible by \\((x - a)(x - c)\\).\n\n232. The same mode of reasoning may be extended to all equations whatever; so that if we suppose\n\n\\[ x^n + Px^{n-1} + Qx^{n-2} + \\ldots + Sx + T + U = 0 \\]\n\nan equation of the \\(n\\)th degree to have a divisor of this form\n\n\\[ (x - a)^n(x - d)^m(x - f)^r \\ldots &c. \\]\n\nThe equation\n\n\\[ mx^{n-1} + (m-1)Px^{n-2} + (m-2)Qx^{n-3} \\ldots + 2Sx + T = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is of the next lower degree, will have for a divisor\n\n\\[ (x - a)^{n-1}(x - d)^{m-1}(x - f)^{r-1} \\ldots &c. \\]\n\nand as this last product must be a divisor of both equations, it may always be discovered by the rule which has been given (\\$49) for finding the greatest common divisor of two algebraic quantities.\n\n233. Again, as this last equation must, in the case of equal roots, have the same properties as the original equation; therefore, if we multiply each of its terms by the exponent of \\(x\\), and diminish that exponent by unity, as before, we have\n\n\\[ m(m-1)x^{n-2} + (m-1)(m-2)Px^{n-3} + (m-2)(m-3)Qx^{n-4} \\ldots + 2Sx + T = 0, \\]\n\na new equation, which will have for a divisor\n\n\\[ (x - a)^{n-2}(x - d)^{m-2}(x - f)^{r-2}, \\]\n\nwhere the exponent of the factors are one less than those of the equation from which it was derived; and as this last divisor is also a divisor of the original equation, it may be discovered in the same manner as the former, namely, by finding the greatest common measure of both equations; and so on we may proceed as far as we please.\n\n234. As a particular example, let us take this equation\n\n\\[ x^5 - 13x^4 + 67x^3 - 171x^2 + 216x - 108 = 0, \\]\n\nand apply to it the method we have explained, in order to discover whether it has equal roots, and if so, what they are. We must therefore seek the greatest common measure of the proposed equation and this other equation, which is formed agreeably to what has been shewn § 228;\n\n\\[ 5x^4 - 52x^3 + 201x^2 - 342x + 216 = 0 \\]\n\nand the operation being performed, we find that they have a common divisor \\(x^3 - 8x^2 + 21x - 18\\), which is of the third degree and consequently may have several factors. Let us therefore try whether the last equation and the following\n\n\\[ 20x^3 - 156x^2 + 402x - 342 = 0, \\]\n\nwhich is derived from it, as directed in § 228, have any common divisor; and by proceeding as before, we find\nEquations find that they admit of this divisor \\( x - 3 \\), which is also a factor of the last divisor \\( x^2 - 8x + 21 = 18 \\), and therefore the product of remaining factors is immediately found by division to be \\( x^4 - 5x^3 + 6 \\) which is evidently resolvable into \\( x - 2 \\) and \\( x - 3 \\).\n\nThus it appears upon the whole, that the common divisor of the original equation, and that which is immediately derived from it, is \\( (x - 2)(x - 3)^2 \\); and that the common divisor of the second and third equations is \\( x - 3 \\). Hence it follows that the proposed equation has \\( (x - 2)^2 \\) for one factor, and \\( (x - 3)^3 \\) for another factor; so that the equation itself may be expressed thus, \\( (x - 2)^2(x - 3)^3 = 0 \\), and the truth of this conclusion may be easily verified by multiplication.\n\n**Sect. XV. Resolution of Equations whose Roots are Rational.**\n\n235. It has been shewn in § 169 that the last term of any equation is always the product of its roots taken with contrary signs: Hence it follows that when the roots are rational they may be discovered by the following rule.\n\nBring all the terms of the equation to one side; find all the divisors of the last term, and substitute them successively for the unknown quantity in the equation. Then each divisor, which produces a result equal to 0, is a root of the proposed equation.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let \\( x^4 - 4x^3 - 7x + 10 = 0 \\) be the proposed equation.\n\nThen, the divisors of 10 the last term are 1, 2, 5, 10, each of which may be taken either positively, or negatively, and these being substituted successively for \\( x \\), we obtain the following results.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n+1 & 1 & -4 & 7 & 10 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 4 & -1 & 12 \\\\\n+2 & 8 & -16 & 14 & 10 \\\\\n-2 & -8 & 16 & -14 & 10 \\\\\n+5 & 125 & -100 & 35 & 10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHere the divisors which produce results equal to 0 are \\( +1, -2 \\) and \\( +5 \\), and therefore these numbers are the three roots of the proposed equation.\n\n236. When the number of divisors to be tried happens to be considerable, it will be convenient to transform the proposed equation into another, in which the last term has fewer divisors. This may, in general, be done by forming an equation, the roots of which are greater or less than those of the proposed equation by some determinate quantity, as in the following example:\n\n**Ex. 2.** Let \\( y^4 - 4y^3 - 8y + 32 = 0 \\) be proposed.\n\nHere the divisors to be tried are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, each taken either positively or negatively; but to prevent the trouble of so many substitutions, let us transform the equation, by putting \\( x + 1 \\) for \\( y \\).\n\nThen\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny^4 &= x^4 + 4x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x + 1 \\\\\n-4y^3 &= -4x^3 - 12x^2 - 12x - 4 \\\\\n-8y &= -8x - 8 \\\\\n+32 &= +32 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( x^4 - 6x^3 - 16x + 21 = 0 \\)\n\nThe roots of which are the imaginary quantities \\( -2 + \\sqrt{-3} \\) and \\( -2 - \\sqrt{-3} \\); so that since \\( y = x + 1 \\), the roots of the equation \\( y^4 - 4y^3 - 8y + 32 = 0 \\) are these,\n\n\\( y = +2, y = +4, y = -1 + \\sqrt{-3}, y = -1 - \\sqrt{-3} \\).\n\nIf this literal equation were proposed\n\n\\[\nx^3 - (3a + b)x^2 + (2a^2 + 3ab)x - 2a^2b = 0,\n\\]\n\nby proceeding as before, we should find \\( x = a, x = 2a, x = b \\) for the roots.\n\n237. To avoid the trouble of trying all the divisors of the last term, a rule may be investigated for restricting the number to very narrow limits as follows:\n\nSuppose that the cubic equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0 \\) is to be resolved. Let it be transformed into another, the roots of which are less than those of the proposed equation by unity: this may be done by assuming \\( y = x - 1 \\), and the last term of the transformed equation will be \\( 1 + p + q + r \\). Again, by assuming \\( y = x + 1 \\) another equation will be formed whose roots exceed those of the proposed equation by unity, and the last term of this other transformed equation will be \\( -1 + p - q + r \\). And here it is to be observed, that these two quantities \\( 1 + p + q + r \\) and \\( -1 + p - q + r \\) are formed from the proposed equation \\( x^3 + px^2 + qx + r \\) by substituting in it successively \\( +1 \\) and \\( -1 \\) for \\( x \\).\n\nNow the values of \\( x \\) are some of the divisors of \\( r \\), which is the term left in the proposed equation, when \\( x \\) is supposed \\( = 0 \\); and the values of the \\( y \\)'s are some of the divisors of \\( 1 + p + q + r \\) and \\( -1 + p - q + r \\) respectively; and these values are in arithmetical progression, increasing by the common difference unity; because \\( x = 1, x = -1 \\) are in that progression; and it is obvious, that the same reasoning will apply to an equation of any degree whatever. Hence the following rule.\n\nSubstitute in place of the unknown quantity, successively, three or more terms of the progression 1, 0, -1, &c., and find all the divisors of the sums that result, then take out all the arithmetical progressions that can be found among these divisors, whose common difference is 1, and the values of \\( x \\) will be among these terms of the progressions, which are the divisors of the result arising from the substitution of \\( x = 0 \\). When the series increases, the roots will be positive; and, when it decreases, they will be negative.\n\n**Ex. 1.** Let it be required to find a root of the equation \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 = 0 \\).\nIn this example there is only one progression, 4, 3, 2, the term of which opposite to the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\) being 3, and the series decreasing, we try if \\( -3 \\) substituted for \\( x \\) makes the equation vanish, and as it succeeds, it follows that \\( -3 \\) is one of its roots. To find the remaining roots, if \\( x^3 - x^2 - 10x + 6 \\) be divided by \\( x + 3 \\), and the quotient \\( x^2 - 4x + 2 \\) put \\( = 0 \\), they will appear to be \\( 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nEx. 2. Let the proposed equation be\n\n\\[\nx^4 + x^3 - 29x^2 - 9x + 180 = 0.\n\\]\n\nTo find its roots.\n\nHere there are four progressions, two increasing and two decreasing; hence, by taking their terms, which are opposite to the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\), we have these four numbers to be tried as roots of the equation \\( +3, +4, -3, -5 \\); all of which are found to succeed.\n\n238. If any of the coefficients of the proposed equation be a fraction, the equation may be transformed into another, having the coefficient of the highest power unity, and those of the remaining terms integers by § 189 and the roots of the transformed equation being found, those of the proposed equation may be easily derived from them.\n\nFor example, if the proposed equation be \\( x^3 - \\frac{3}{4}x^2 + \\frac{3}{4}x - 6 = 0 \\). Let us assume \\( x = \\frac{y}{4} \\); thus the equation is transformed to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{y^3}{64} - \\frac{7y^2}{64} + \\frac{35y}{16} - 6 = 0,\n\\]\n\nOr \\( y^3 - 7y^2 + 140y - 384 = 0 \\),\n\none root of which is \\( y = 3 \\); hence \\( x = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe proposed equation being now divided by \\( x - \\frac{3}{4} \\) is reduced to this quadratic \\( x^2 + 8 = 0 \\) the roots of which are both impossible.\n\n239. When the coefficients of an equation are integers, and that of the highest power of the unknown quantity unity, if its roots are not found among the divisors of the last term, we may be certain that, whether the equation be pure or affected, its roots cannot be exactly expressed either by whole numbers or rational fractions. This may be demonstrated by means of the following proposition. If a prime number \\( P \\) be a divisor of the product of two numbers \\( A \\) and \\( B \\); it will also be a divisor of at least one of the numbers.\n\nLet us suppose that it does not divide \\( B \\), and that \\( B \\) is greater than \\( P \\); then, putting \\( q \\) for the greatest number of times that \\( P \\) can be had in \\( B \\), and \\( B' \\) for the remainder, we have \\( \\frac{B}{P} = q + \\frac{B'}{P} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{AB}{P} = qA + \\frac{AB'}{P}.\n\\]\n\nHence it appears, that if \\( P \\) be a divisor of \\( AB \\), it is also a divisor of \\( AB' \\). Now \\( B' \\) is less than \\( P \\), for it is the remainder which is found in dividing \\( B \\) by \\( P \\); therefore, seeing we cannot divide \\( B' \\) by \\( P \\), let \\( P \\) be divided by \\( B' \\), and \\( q' \\) put for the quotient, also \\( B'' \\) for the remainder; again let \\( P \\) be divided by \\( B'' \\), and \\( q'' \\) put for the quotient, and \\( B''' \\) for the remainder, and so on; and as \\( P \\) is supposed to be a prime number, it is evident that this series of operations may be continued till a remainder be found equal to unity, which will at last be the case, for the divisors are the successive remainders of the divisions, and therefore each is less than the divisor which preceded it. By performing these operations we obtain the following series of equations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP &= q'B' + B'' \\\\\nP &= q''B'' + B''', \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand therefore\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nB' &= \\frac{P - B''}{q'} \\\\\nB'' &= \\frac{P - B'''}{q''}, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence we have \\( AB' = \\frac{AP - AB''}{q'} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{q'AB'}{P} = \\frac{AP - AB''}{P} = A - \\frac{AB''}{P}.\n\\]\n\nNow, if \\( AB \\) be divisible by \\( P \\), we have shewn that \\( AB' \\), and consequently \\( q'AB' \\) is divisible by \\( P \\); therefore, from the last equation, it appears that \\( AB'' \\) must also be divisible by \\( P \\).\n\nAgain, from the preceding series of equations, we have \\( AB'' = \\frac{AP - AB'''}{q''} \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{q''AB''}{P} = \\frac{AP - AB'''}{P} = A - \\frac{AB'''}{P};\n\\]\n\nhence we conclude that \\( AB'' \\) is also divisible by \\( P \\).\n\nProceeding in this manner, and observing that the series of quantities \\( B', B'', B''', &c. \\) continually decrease till one of them \\( = 1 \\), it is evident that we shall at last come to a product of this form \\( A \\times 1 \\), which must\nEquations must be divisible by \\( P \\), and hence the truth of the proposition is manifest.\n\n241. It follows from this proposition, that if the prime number \\( P \\), which we have supposed not to be a divisor of \\( B \\), is at the same time not a divisor of \\( A \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( AB \\) the product of \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n242. Let \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\) be a fraction in its lowest terms, then the numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have no common divisor; but from what has been just now shewn, it appears, that if a prime number be not a divisor of \\( a \\) it cannot be a divisor of \\( a \\times a \\) or \\( a^2 \\), and in like manner, that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( b \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( b \\times b \\) or \\( b^2 \\); therefore, it is evident that \\( a^2 \\) and \\( b^2 \\) have no common divisor, and thus the fraction \\( \\frac{b^2}{a^2} \\) is also in its lowest terms.\n\nHence it follows that the square of any fractional quantity is still a fraction, and cannot possibly be a whole number; and, on the contrary, that the square root of a whole number cannot possibly be a fraction; so that all such whole numbers as are not perfect squares can neither have their roots expressed by integers nor by fractions.\n\n243. Since that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it is also not a divisor of \\( a^2 \\), therefore if it is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( a \\times a^3 \\) or \\( a^4 \\), § 241, and by reasoning in this way, it is obvious that if a prime number is not a divisor of \\( a \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( a^2 \\); also, that if it is not a divisor of \\( b \\), it cannot be a divisor of \\( b^2 \\), therefore if \\( \\frac{b}{a} \\) is a fraction in its lowest terms \\( \\frac{b^2}{a^2} \\) is also a fraction in its lowest terms; so that any power whatever of a fraction is also a fraction, and on the contrary, any root of a whole number is also a whole number. Hence it follows that if the root of a whole number is not expressible by an integer, such root cannot be expressed by a fraction, but is therefore irrational or incommensurable.\n\n244. Let us next suppose that\n\n\\[\nx^n + Px^{n-1} + Qx^{n-2} + \\cdots + Tx + U = 0\n\\]\n\nis any equation whatever, in which \\( P, Q, \\ldots \\) denote integer numbers; then if its roots are not integers they cannot possibly be rational fractions. For if possible, let us suppose \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\), a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, then, by substitution\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^n}{b^n} + \\frac{Pa^{n-1}}{b^n} + \\frac{Qa^{n-2}}{b^n} + \\cdots + \\frac{Tb}{b^n} + \\frac{U}{b^n} = 0\n\\]\n\nand, reducing all the terms to a common denominator,\n\n\\[\na^n + Pa^{n-1}b + Qa^{n-2}b^2 + \\cdots + Tab^{n-1} + Ub^n = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhich equation may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\na^n + b(Pa^{n-1} + Qa^{n-2}b + \\cdots + Tab^{n-1} + Ub^n) = 0,\n\\]\n\nwhere the equation consists of two parts, one of which is divisible by \\( b \\). But by hypothesis \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) have no common measure, therefore \\( a^n \\) is not divisible by \\( b \\), § 243, hence it is evident that the two parts of the equation cannot destroy each other as they ought to do; therefore \\( x \\) cannot possibly be a fraction.\n\nSect. XVI. Resolution of Equations by Approximation.\n\n245. When the roots of an equation cannot be accurately expressed by rational numbers, it is necessary to have recourse to the methods of approximation, and by these we can always determine the numerical values of the roots to as great a degree of accuracy as we please.\n\n246. The application of the methods of approximation is rendered easy by means of the following principles:\n\nIf two numbers, either whole or fractional, be found, which, when substituted for the unknown quantity in any equation, produce results with contrary signs; we may conclude that at least one root of the proposed equation is between those numbers, and is consequently real.\n\nLet the proposed equation be\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15 = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich, by collecting the positive terms into one sum, and the negative into another, may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 10x - (5x^2 + 15) = 0\n\\]\n\nthen, to determine a root of the equation, we must find such a number as when substituted for \\( x \\) will render\n\n\\[\nx^3 + 10x = 5x^2 + 15.\n\\]\n\nLet us suppose \\( x \\) to have every degree of magnitude from 0 upwards in the scale of number, then \\( x^3 + 10x \\) and \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\) will both continually increase, but with different degrees of quickness, as appears from the following table.\n\n| Successive values of \\( x \\): | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c. |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| \\( x^3 + 10x \\):            | 0, 11, 28, 57, 104, 175, 276, &c. |\n| \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\):           | 15, 20, 35, 60, 95, 140, 195, &c. |\n\nBy inspecting this table, it appears that while \\( x \\) increases from 0 to a certain numerical value, which exceeds 3, the positive part of the equation, or \\( x^3 + 10x \\), is always less than the negative part, or \\( 5x^2 + 15 \\); so that the expression\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15\n\\]\n\nmust necessarily be negative.\n\nIt also appears that when \\( x \\) has increased beyond that numerical value, and which is evidently less than 4, the positive part of the equation, instead of being less than the negative part, is now greater, and therefore the expression\n\n\\[\nx^3 - 5x^2 + 10x - 15\n\\]\n\nis changed from a negative to a positive quantity.\n\n247. Hence we may conclude that there is some real and determinate value of \\( x \\), which is greater than 3, but less than 4, and which will render the positive and negative parts of the equation equal to one another; therefore that value of \\( x \\) must be a root of the proposed equation; and as what has been just now shewn in a particular case will readily apply to any equation whatever, the truth of what has been asserted at § 246 is obvious.\n\n248. Two\n248. Two limits, between which all the roots of any equation are contained, may be determined by the following proposition.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the greatest negative coefficient in any equation. Change the signs of the terms taken alternately, beginning with the second, and let \\( N' \\) be the greatest negative coefficient after the signs are changed. The positive roots of the equation are contained between 0 and \\( N+1 \\), and the negative roots between 0 and \\( -N'-1 \\).\n\nSuppose the equation to be\n\n\\[\nx^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich may be also expressed thus\n\n\\[\nx^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4}\\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThen, whatever be the values of the coefficients \\( p, q, r, \\) &c., it is evident that \\( x \\) may be taken so great as to render each of the quantities \\( \\frac{p}{x}, \\frac{q}{x^2}, \\frac{r}{x^3}, \\frac{s}{x^4} \\) as small as we please, and therefore their sum, or \\( \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4} \\), less than 1; but in that case the quantity\n\n\\[\nx^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{x} + \\frac{q}{x^2} + \\frac{r}{x^3} + \\frac{s}{x^4}\\right)\n\\]\n\nor \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\)\n\nwill be positive, and such, that the first term \\( x^4 \\) is greater than the sum of all the remaining terms, therefore also \\( x^4 + qx^2 \\) the sum of the positive terms will be much greater than \\( px^3 + rx + s \\) the sum of the negative terms alone.\n\nHence it follows, that if a number be found, which when substituted for \\( x \\), renders the expression \\( x^4 - px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s \\) positive, and which is also such that every greater number has the same property, that number will exceed the greatest positive root of the equation.\n\nNow, if we suppose \\( N \\) to be the greatest negative coefficient, it is evident that the positive part of the equation, or \\( x^4 + qx^2 \\), is greater than \\( px^3 + rx + s \\), provided that \\( x^4 \\) is greater than \\( Nx^4 + Nx^3 + Nx^2 + N \\), or \\( N(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) \\); but \\( x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = x^4 - 1 \\), therefore a positive result will be obtained, if for \\( x \\) there be substituted a number such that \\( x^4 > \\frac{Nx^4 - 1}{x - 1} \\) or \\( x^4 - Nx^4 = N \\). Now this last condition will evidently be fulfilled if we take \\( x^4 = Nx^4 \\), and from this equation we find \\( x = N + 1 \\); but it further appears that the same condition will also be fulfilled as often as \\( x^4 - Nx^4 \\) or \\( x^4 - N \\), that is \\( x > N + 1 \\), therefore \\( N + 1 \\) must be a limit to the greatest positive root of the proposed equation, as was to be shewn.\n\n249. If \\( y \\) be substituted for \\( +x \\), the equation\n\n\\[\ny^4 + py^3 + qy^2 + ry + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwill be transformed into\n\n\\[\ny^4 + py^3 + qy^2 + ry + s = 0\n\\]\n\nwhich equation differs from the former only in the signs of the second, fourth, &c. Approximation terms; and as the positive roots of this half equation are the same as the negative roots of the proposed equation, it is evident that their limit must be such as has been assigned.\n\n250. From the two preceding propositions it will not be difficult to discover, by means of a few trials, the nearest integers to the roots of any proposed numerical equation, and those being found, we may approximate to the roots continually, as in the following example:\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 4x^3 - 3x + 27 = 0.\n\\]\n\nHere the greatest negative coefficient being 4, it follows, § 248, that the greatest positive root is less than 5. If \\( y \\) be substituted for \\( x \\), the equation is transformed to\n\n\\[\ny^4 + 4y^3 + 3y + 27 = 0\n\\]\n\nan equation having all its terms positive; therefore, it can have no positive roots, and consequently the proposed equation can have no negative roots; its real roots must therefore be contained between 0 and \\( +5 \\).\n\n251. To determine the limits of each root in particular, let 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, be substituted successively for \\( x \\); thus we obtain the following corresponding results.\n\n| Substitutions for \\( x \\) | Results |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| 0                        | +27     |\n| 1                        | +21     |\n| 2                        | +5      |\n| 3                        | -9      |\n| 4                        | +15     |\n\nHence it appears that the equation has two real roots, one between 2 and 3, and another between 3 and 4.\n\n252. That we may approximate to the first root, let us suppose \\( x = 2 + y \\), where \\( y \\) is a fraction less than unity, and therefore its second, and higher powers but small in comparison to its first power; hence, in finding an approximate value of \\( y \\), they may be rejected.\n\nThus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= +16 + 32y, \\\\\n-4x^3 &= -32 - 48y, \\\\\n-3x &= -6 - 3y, \\\\\n+27 &= +27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\( o = 5 - 19y \\) nearly\n\nand \\( y = \\frac{5}{19} = .26 \\), therefore, for a first approximation, we have \\( x = 2.26 \\).\n\nLet us next suppose \\( x = 2.26 + y' \\), then, rejecting as before the second and higher powers of \\( y' \\) on account of their smallness, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx^4 &= +26.087 + 46.172y' + \\text{&c.} \\\\\n-4x^3 &= -46.172 - 61.291y' + \\text{&c.} \\\\\n-3x &= -6.780 - 3y', \\\\\n+27 &= +27\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\( o = .135 - 18.119y' \\) nearly\n\nHence \\( y' = \\frac{.135}{18.119} = .0075 \\) and \\( x = 2.26 + y' = 2.2675 \\).\n\nThis value of \\( x \\) is true to the last figure, but a more accurate value may be obtained by supposing \\( x = 2.675 + y'' \\), and finding the value of \\( y'' \\) in the same manner as we have already found those of \\( y' \\) and \\( y \\); and thus the...\nApproximation may be continued till any required degree of accuracy be obtained.\n\nThe second root of the equation, which we have already found to be between 3 and 4, may be investigated in the same manner as the first, and will appear to be 3.6797; the approximation being carried on to the fourth figure of the decimal, in determining each root.\n\n253. In the preceding example we have shown how to approximate to the roots of an affected equation, but the same method will also apply to pure equations. For example, let it be required to determine \\( x \\) from this equation \\( x^2 = 2 \\).\n\nBecause \\( x \\) is greater than 1, and less than 2, but nearer to the former number than to the latter, let us assume \\( x = 1 + y \\), then rejecting the powers of \\( y \\) which exceed the first, we have \\( x^2 = 1 + 2y \\), and therefore \\( 2 = 1 + 3y \\), and \\( y = \\frac{1}{3} \\) nearly, hence \\( x = 1.3 \\) nearly.\n\nLet us next assume \\( x = 1.3 + y' \\), then proceeding as before, we find \\( 2 = 2.197 + 5.07y' \\), hence \\( y' = -\\frac{1.197}{5.07} = -0.39 \\), and \\( x = 1.3 - 0.39 = 1.26 \\) nearly.\n\nTo find a still nearer approximation let us suppose \\( x = 1.26 + y'' \\), then from this assumption we find \\( y'' = -0.00079 \\), and therefore \\( x = 1.259921 \\), which value is true to the last figure.\n\n254. By assuming an equation of any order with literal coefficients, a general formula may be investigated, for approximating to the roots of equations belonging to that particular order.\n\nLet us take for an example the cubic equation\n\n\\[ x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0, \\]\n\nand suppose that \\( x = a + y \\), where \\( a \\) is nearly equal to \\( x \\), and \\( y \\) is a small fraction. Then, by substituting \\( a + y \\) for \\( x \\) in the proposed equation, and rejecting the powers of \\( y \\) which exceed the first, on account of their smallness, we have\n\n\\[ a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r + (3a^2 + 2pa + q)y = 0. \\]\n\nHence \\( y = -\\frac{a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} \\)\n\nand \\( x = a - \\frac{a^3 + pa^2 + qa + r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} = \\frac{2a^3 + pa^2 - r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} \\).\n\n255. Let it be required to approximate to a root of the cubic equation \\( x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \\). Here \\( p = 2 \\), \\( q = 3 \\) and \\( r = -5 \\); and by trials it appears that \\( x \\) is between 2 and 3, but nearest the latter number; therefore for the first approximation \\( a \\) may be supposed = 3, hence we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2a^3 + pa^2 - r}{3a^2 + 2pa + q} = \\frac{123}{42} = 2.93. \\]\n\nBy substituting \\( \\frac{6}{11} \\) for \\( a \\) in the formula, and proceeding as before, a value of \\( x \\) would be found more exact than the former, and so on we may go as far as we please.\n\n256. The method we have hitherto employed for approximating to the roots of equations is known by the name of The method of successive substitutions, and was first proposed by Newton. It has been since improved by Lagrange, who has given it a form which has the advantage of shewing the progress made in the approximation by each operation. This improved form we now proceed to explain.\n\nLet \\( a \\) denote the whole number, next less to the root sought, and \\( \\frac{1}{y} \\) a fraction, which when added to \\( a \\),\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{1}{y}. \\]\n\nIf this value of \\( x \\) be substituted in the proposed equation, a new equation involving \\( y \\) will be had, which, when cleared of fractions, will necessarily have a root greater than unity.\n\nLet \\( b \\) be the whole number which is next less than that root, then, for a first approximation, we have \\( x = a + \\frac{1}{b} \\). But \\( b \\) being only an approximate value of \\( y \\), in the same manner as \\( a \\) is an approximate value of \\( x \\), we may suppose \\( y = b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\), then, by substituting \\( b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\) for \\( y \\), we shall have a new equation, involving only \\( y' \\), which must be greater than unity; putting therefore \\( b' \\) to denote the next whole number less than the root of the equation involving \\( y' \\), we have \\( y = b + \\frac{1}{b'} = \\frac{bb' + 1}{b'} \\),\n\nand substituting this value in that of \\( x \\) the result is\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{b'}{bb' + 1} \\]\n\nfor a second approximate value of \\( x \\).\n\nTo find a third value we may take \\( y' = b' + \\frac{1}{y''} \\), then if \\( b'' \\) denote the next whole number less than \\( y'' \\), we have \\( y' = b' + \\frac{1}{b''} = \\frac{bb' + b'' + 1}{b'b'' + 1} \\) and\n\n\\[ x = a + \\frac{b'b'' + 1}{bb'b'' + b'' + b} \\]\n\nand so on to obtain more accurate approximations.\n\n257. We shall apply this method to the following example\n\n\\[ x^3 - 7x + 7 = 0. \\]\n\nHere the positive roots must be between 0 and 8 let us therefore substitute successively, 0, 1, 2, . . . to 8 and we obtain results as follow:\n\n| Substitutions | Results |\n|---------------|---------|\n| 0             | +7, +1, +1, +13, +43, +97, +181, +301, +465, |\n\nbut as these results have all the same sign, nothing can be concluded respecting the magnitude of the roots from that circumstance alone. It is, however, observable, that while \\( x \\) increases from 0 to 1 the results decrease; but that whatever successive magnitudes \\( x \\) has greater than 2, the results increase; we may therefore reasonably conclude that if the equation have any positive roots they must be between 1 and 2. Accordingly by substituting 1, 2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 successively for \\( x \\) we find these results +3.28, -0.56, -1.04, +2.32, and...\nApproximation, and as there are here two changes of the signs, it follows that the equation has two positive roots, one between 1.2 and 1.4, and another between 1.6 and 1.8.\n\nHence it appears that to find either value of \\( x \\) we may assume \\( x = 1 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), thus, by substitution, we have\n\n\\[\ny' - 4y^2 + 3y + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe limit of the positive roots of this last equation is 5, and by substituting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 successively for \\( y \\), it will be found to have two, one of which is between 1 and 2, and the other between 2 and 3. Therefore for a first approximation we have\n\n\\[\nx = 1 + \\frac{1}{y}, \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\text{that is } x = 2, \\quad x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nTo approach nearer to the first value of \\( y \\), let us take\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\frac{1}{y}, \\quad \\text{and therefore}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny' - 2y^2 - y + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis last equation will be found to have only one real root between 2 and 3, from which it appears that \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and \\( x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n\nLet us next suppose \\( y' = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\ny'' - 3y'^2 - 4y' - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nand from this equation \\( y'' \\) is found to be between 4 and 5. Taking the least limit we have\n\n\\[\ny' = 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}, \\quad y = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}, \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nIt is easy to continue this process by assuming \\( y' = 4 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and so on, as far as may be judged necessary.\n\nWe return to the second value of \\( x \\), which was found \\( = \\frac{3}{2} \\) by the first approximation, and which corresponds to \\( y = 2 \\). Putting \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and substituting this value in the equation \\( y' - 4y^2 + 3y + 1 = 0 \\), which was formerly found, we get\n\n\\[\ny' - 4y^2 - 2y - 1 = 0,\n\\]\n\nthis equation, as well as the corresponding equation employed in determining the other value of \\( x \\), has only one root greater than unity, which root being between 1 and 2, let us take \\( y' = 1 \\), we thence find\n\n\\[\ny = 3 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nPut \\( y = 1 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and we thence find by substitution\n\n\\[\ny' - 3y'^2 - 4y' - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nan equation which gives \\( y'' \\) between 4 and 5, hence as before,\n\n\\[\ny' = 5, \\quad y = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad x = \\frac{3}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThat we may proceed in the approximation we have only to suppose \\( y'' = 4 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), and so on. The equation \\( x^3 - 7x + 7 \\) has also a negative root between -3 and -4, and to find a nearer value we may put \\( x = -3 \\), hence we have \\( y' - 2y^2 - 9y - 1 = 0 \\), and \\( y > 2 \\), \\( y < 2 \\) and therefore, for the first approximation, \\( x = -3 - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{6}{2} \\). By putting \\( y = 2 + \\frac{1}{y} \\), &c. we may obtain successive values of \\( x \\), each of which will be more exact than that which preceded it.\n\n258. The successive equations which involve \\( y \\), \\( y' \\), \\( y'' \\), &c., have never more than one root greater than unity, unless that two or more roots of the proposed equation are contained between the limits \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\), but when that circumstance has place, as in the preceding example, some one of the equations involving \\( y \\), \\( y' \\), &c. will have more than one root greater than unity, and from each root a series of equations may be derived, by which we may approximate to the particular roots of the proposed equation contained between the limits \\( a \\) and \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nSect. XVII. Of Infinite Series.\n\n259. The resolving of any proposed quantity into a series, is a problem of considerable importance in the application of algebra to the higher branches of the mathematics, and there are various methods by which it may be performed, suited to the particular forms of the quantities which may become the subject of consideration.\n\n260. Any rational fraction may be resolved into a series by the common operation of algebraic division as in the following examples:\n\nEx. 1. To change \\( \\frac{ax}{a-x} \\) into an infinite series\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(ax)ax & (x + \\frac{x^2}{a} + \\frac{x^3}{a^2} + \\frac{x^4}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c. \\\\\n\\frac{ax}{a-x} & x^2 + \\frac{x^3}{a} + \\frac{x^4}{a^2} + \\frac{x^5}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus it appears, that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{ax}{a-x} = x + \\frac{x^2}{a} + \\frac{x^3}{a^2} + \\frac{x^4}{a^3} + \\ldots, \\&c.\n\\]\n\nHere the law of the series being evident, the terms may be continued at pleasure.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to convert \\( \\frac{a^2}{(a+x)^2} \\) into an infinite series\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + 2ax + x^2)^a &= \\left(1 - \\frac{2x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n&= a^2 + 2ax + x^2 \\\\\n&- 2ax - x^2 \\\\\n&+ 3x^2 + \\frac{2x^3}{a} \\\\\n&+ 3x^3 + \\frac{6x^4}{a^2} + \\frac{3x^4}{a^2} \\\\\n&- \\frac{4x^3}{a} - \\frac{3x^4}{a^2} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(\\frac{a^2}{(a+x)^2} = 1 - \\frac{2x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{5x^4}{a^4} + \\ldots\\), the law of continuation being evident.\n\n261. A second method by which algebraic quantities, whether rational or irrational, may be converted into series, and which is also of very extensive use in the higher parts of the mathematics, consists in assuming a series with indeterminate coefficients, and having its terms proceeding according to the powers of some quantity contained in the proposed expression.\n\nThat we may explain this method, let us suppose that the fraction \\(\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2}\\) is to be converted into a series proceeding by the powers of \\(x\\); we are therefore to allume\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(A\\) denotes these terms of the series into which \\(x\\) does not at all enter; \\(Bx\\) the terms which contain only the first power of \\(x\\); \\(Cx^2\\) the terms which contain only the second power, and so on. Let both sides of the equation be multiplied by \\(a^2 + ax + x^2\\) so as to take away the denominator of the fraction, and let the numerator \\(a^2\\) be transposed to the other side, so that the whole expression may be \\(= 0\\), then\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\{a^2A + a^2B\\}x + \\{a^2C + a^2D\\}x^2 + \\{a^2E + a^2D\\}x^3 + \\ldots & = 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNow the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) being supposed to be entirely independent of any particular value of \\(x\\), it follows that the whole expression can only be \\(= 0\\), upon the supposition that the terms which multiply the same powers of \\(x\\) are separately \\(= 0\\); for if that were not the case, it would follow that \\(x\\) had a certain determinate relation to the quantities \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) which is contrary to what we have all along supposed. To determine the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) therefore, we have this series of equations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na^2A - a^2 &= 0 & \\text{Hence } A = 1 \\\\\na^2B + aA &= 0 & \\text{B} = -\\frac{1}{a} \\\\\na^2C + aB + A &= 0 & \\text{C} = -\\frac{1}{a^2} \\\\\na^2D + aC + B &= 0 & \\text{D} = -\\frac{1}{a^3} \\\\\na^2E + aD + C &= 0 & \\text{E} = -\\frac{1}{a^4} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere the law of relation which takes place among the quantities \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) is evident, viz., that if \\(P, Q, R, \\ldots\\) denote any three coefficients which immediately follow each other\n\n\\[\na^2R + aQ + P = 0\n\\]\n\nand from this equation, by means of the coefficients already determined, we find \\(F = 0, G = \\frac{1}{a^2}, H = \\frac{1}{a^3}, K = 0, \\ldots\\)\n\nTherefore, resuming the assumed equation, and substituting for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) their respective values, we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{a^2 + ax + x^2} = 1 - \\frac{x}{a} + \\frac{3x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{4x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{5x^4}{a^4} - \\frac{7x^5}{a^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n262. As a second example of the method of indeterminate coefficients, let it be required to express the square root of \\(a^2 - x^2\\) by means of a series. For this purpose we might allume\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbut as we would find the coefficients of the odd powers of \\(x\\), each \\(= 0\\), let us rather allume\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthen, squaring both sides, and transposing, we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\{A^2 + 2AB\\}x + \\{2AC + 2AD\\}x^2 + \\{2BC\\}x^3 + \\ldots \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHence \\(A^2 - a^2 = 0\\) and \\(A = a\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2AB + 1 &= 0 & B = -\\frac{1}{2a} \\\\\n2AC + B^2 &= 0 & C = -\\frac{1}{8a^2} \\\\\nAD + BC &= 0 & D = -\\frac{1}{16a^3} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand substituting for \\(A, B, C, \\ldots\\) their values\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = a - \\frac{x^2}{2a} + \\frac{x^4}{8a^3} - \\frac{x^6}{16a^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThis method of resolving a quantity into an infinite series will be found more expeditious than any other, as often as the operations of division and evolution are to be performed at the same time, as in these expressions \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}\\) or \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}\\).\n\n263. The binomial theorem affords a third method of resolving quantities into series, but before we explain this method it will be proper to shew how the theorem itself may be investigated.\n\nLet \\(a + x\\) be any binomial quantity, which is to be raised\nraised to a power denoted by \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\), where \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) denote any numbers either positive or negative. Or because \\( a + x = a(1 + \\frac{x}{a}) \\), if we put \\( \\frac{x}{a} = y \\), then \\( (a + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = a^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\times (1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\); therefore instead of \\( a + x \\) we may consider \\( 1 + y \\), which is somewhat more simple in its form.\n\n264. By considering some of the first powers of \\( 1 + x \\), viz.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(1 + x)^1 &= 1 + x \\\\\n(1 + x)^2 &= 1 + 2x + x^2 \\\\\n(1 + x)^3 &= 1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3 \\\\\n(1 + x)^4 &= 1 + 4x + 6x^2 + 4x^3 + x^4 \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nit appears that the powers of \\( 1 + x \\) have this form\n\n\\[\n1 + Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) are numbers which are altogether independent of any particular value of \\( x \\). It also appears that the series cannot contain any negative power of \\( x \\); for if any of its terms had this form \\( \\frac{Q}{x^n} \\), then, the supposition of \\( x = 0 \\) would render that term indefinitely great, whereas the whole series ought in that case to be reduced to unity.\n\n265. Let us therefore assume\n\n\\[\n(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ay + By^2 + Cy^3 + Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThen we have also\n\n\\[\n(1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet us put \\( (1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = u, (1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = v \\), and therefore\n\n\\[\n(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = u^m, (1 + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = v^m \\]\nthen, taking the difference between the two series, we have\n\n\\[\nu^m - v^m = A(y - x) + B(y^2 - x^2) + C(y^3 - x^3) + D(y^4 - x^4) + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut from the equation originally assumed we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n}(1 + y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}Ay + \\frac{m}{n}By^2 + \\frac{m}{n}Cy^3 + \\frac{m}{n}Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}Ay + \\frac{m}{n}By^2 + \\frac{m}{n}Cy^3 + \\frac{m}{n}Dy^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nAnd as the coefficients of the terms have no connexion with any particular value of \\( y \\), it follows, that the coefficient of any power of \\( y \\) on the one side of the equation must be equal to the coefficient of the same power of \\( y \\) on the other side. Therefore, to determine \\( A, B, C, \\ldots \\) we have the following series of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}A &+ \\frac{m}{n}B + \\frac{m}{n}C + \\frac{m}{n}D + \\ldots \\\\\n&= \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n}A + \\frac{m}{n}B + \\frac{m}{n}C + \\frac{m}{n}D + \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n} \\quad \\text{Hence } A = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ 2B + A = \\frac{m}{n}A \\quad B = \\frac{A(m-1)}{2} = \\frac{A(m-n)}{2n} \\]\n\n\\[ 3C + 2B = \\frac{m}{n}B \\quad C = \\frac{B(m-2)}{3} = \\frac{B(m-2n)}{3n} \\]\n\n\\[ 4D + 3C = \\frac{m}{n}C \\quad D = \\frac{C(m-3)}{4} = \\frac{C(m-3n)}{4n} \\]\n\n\\[ 5E + 4D = \\frac{m}{n}D \\quad E = \\frac{D(m-4)}{5} = \\frac{D(m-4n)}{5n} \\]\n\n&c.\n\nOr, substituting for \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. their values as determined from the preceding equations:\n\n\\[ A = \\frac{m}{n} \\]\n\n\\[ B = \\frac{m(m-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2} \\]\n\n\\[ C = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot n^3} \\]\n\n\\[ D = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)(m-3n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot n^4} \\]\n\n\\[ E = \\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)(m-3n)(m-4n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot n^5} \\]\n\n&c.\n\n267. Refining now the assumed equation,\n\n\\[(1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = 1 + Ay + By^2 + Cy^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nAnd observing that \\( \\frac{x}{a} = y \\) and \\( (a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n}(1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\)\n\nwe have\n\n\\[(a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} \\left( 1 + \\frac{m}{n} \\frac{A(m-n)x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{B(m-2n)}{3n} \\right.\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{x^3}{a^3} + \\frac{C(m-3n)x^4}{4n} + \\ldots \\]\n\nwhere \\( A, B, C, \\) &c. denote the coefficients of the preceding terms, or\n\n\\[(a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} = \\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{m}{n} \\frac{m}{n} x + \\frac{m(m-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2} \\frac{m}{n} x^2 + \\]\n\n\\[\\frac{m(m-n)(m-2n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot n^3} \\frac{m}{n} x^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nand either of these formulae may be considered as a general theorem for raising a binomial quantity \\( a+x \\) to any power whatever.\n\n268. In determining the value of the expression\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} \\quad \\text{when } u = v \\]\n\nit has been taken for granted that \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is positive, but the same conclusion will be obtained when \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) is negative. For, changing \\( +m \\) into \\( -m \\), and observing that\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{v^m - u^m}{u^m v^m} \\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\left( \\frac{v^m - u^m}{u^m v^m} \\right) = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\left( \\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^m v^m} \\right) \\]\n\nNow we have already found, that when \\( u = v \\), the fraction \\( \\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} \\) becomes \\( \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} \\), therefore in the same case\n\n\\[\\frac{u^m - v^m}{u^n - v^n} = \\frac{I}{u^n - v^n} \\times \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} = \\frac{mu^{m-x}}{nu^{n-x}} \\]\n\nand from this last expression we derive the same value for \\( u^m \\) or \\( (1+y)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) as before, regard being had to the change of the sign of the exponent.\n\n269. If we suppose \\( m \\) to be a positive integer, and \\( n = 1 \\) the series given in last article for the powers of \\( a+x \\) will always terminate, as appears also from the operation of involution; but if \\( m \\) be negative, or \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) a fraction, the series will consist of an indefinite number of terms. Examples of the application of the theorem have been already given upon the first supposition, when treating of involution; we now proceed to show how it is to be applied to the expansion of algebraic quantities into series upon either of the two last hypotheses.\n\n270. Ex. 1. It is required to express \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r+z)^3} \\) by means of a series.\n\nBecause \\( \\frac{r}{r+z} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{z}{r}} \\),\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r+z)^3} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^3} = \\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^{-3} \\)\n\nLet \\( \\left(1+\\frac{z}{r}\\right)^{-3} \\) be compared with \\( (a+x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) and we have\n\n\\[ a = 1, \\quad x = \\frac{z}{r}, \\quad m = -3, \\quad n = 1. \\]\n\nHence, by substituting these values of \\( a, x, m, n \\) in the first general formula of (\\$267) we have\n\n\\[\\frac{r}{(r+z)^3} = 1 - \\frac{3z}{r} + \\frac{3z^2}{r^2} - \\frac{3z^3}{r^3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nEx. 2.\nEx. 2. It is required to express \\( \\sqrt{a + b} \\) by the form of a series.\n\nBecause \\( a + b = a \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\)\n\nTherefore \\( \\sqrt{a + b} = \\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{b}{a}} = a^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\)\n\nBy comparing \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{a}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\) with \\( (a + x)^{\\frac{m}{n}} \\) we have \\( a = 1, x = \\frac{b}{a}, m = 1, n = 3 \\),\n\nand substituting as in last example\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a + b} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\na^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{3a} - \\frac{1.2b^2}{36a^2} + \\frac{1.2.5b^4}{36.9a^3} - \\frac{1.2.5.8b^6}{36.9.12a^4} + \\ldots \\right) \\\\\n= a^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{3a} - \\frac{b^2}{9a^2} + \\frac{5b^4}{81a^3} - \\frac{10b^6}{243a^4} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nEx. 3. It is required to resolve \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} \\) into a series.\n\nBecause \\( \\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = r^3 \\times (r^3 + z^3)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\), if we raise \\( r^3 + z^3 \\) to the \\(-\\frac{1}{3}\\) power, and multiply the resulting series by \\( r^3 \\), we shall have the series required. Or the given quantity may be reduced to a more simple form thus;\n\nbecause \\( r^3 + z^3 = r^3 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right) \\)\n\nTherefore \\( (r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = r^3 \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}}. \\text{ Hence}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{r^3}{(r^3 + z^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}}} = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\n\\left(1 + \\frac{z^3}{r^3}\\right)^{-\\frac{1}{3}} \\\\\n= 1 - \\frac{2z^3}{3r^3} + \\frac{2.5z^6}{36r^6} - \\frac{2.5.8z^9}{36.9r^9} + \\frac{2.5.8.11z^{12}}{36.9.12r^{12}} + \\ldots\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\\]\n\nEx. 4. It is required to find a series equal to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} \\).\n\nFirst by the binomial theorem we have\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2} = (a^2 + x^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = a + \\frac{x^2}{2a} - \\frac{x^4}{8a^2} + \\frac{x^6}{16a^3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = (a^2 - x^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{2a^2} + \\frac{3x^4}{8a^4} + \\frac{5x^6}{16a^6} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking the product of the two series, and proceeding in the operation only to such terms as involve the 6th power of \\( x \\), we find\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2 + x^2}}{\\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = 1 + \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{x^4}{2a^4} + \\frac{x^6}{2a^6} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nSect. XVIII. Of the Reversion of Series.\n\n271. The method of indeterminate coefficients, which we have already employed when treating of infinite series, may also be applied to what is called the reverting of series; that is, having any quantity expressed by an infinite series composed of the powers of another quantity, to express, on the contrary, the latter quantity by means of an infinite series composed of the powers of the former.\n\n272. Let \\( y = n + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \\ldots \\), &c.\n\nThen to revert the series we must find the value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\). For this purpose we shall transpose \\( n \\), and put \\( z = y - n \\), then\n\n\\[\nz = ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + dx^4 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nNow when \\( x = 0 \\), it is evident that \\( z = 0 \\), therefore we may assume for \\( x \\) a series of this form\n\n\\[\nx = A + Bz + Cz^2 + Dz^3 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\n\nwhere the coefficients \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) denote quantities as yet unknown, but which are entirely independent of the quantity \\( x \\). To determine those quantities let the first, second, third, &c., powers of the series\n\n\\[\nAz + Bz^2 + Cz^3 + Dz^4 + \\ldots, \\text{ &c.}\n\\]\nbe found by multiplication, and substituted for \\( x, x^2, \\ldots \\), &c. respectively, in the equation\n\n\\[\n0 = -x + ax + bx^2 + cx^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n-ax &= aAx + aBx^2 + aCx^3 + aDx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+bx^2 &= bAx^2 + 2bABx^3 + 2bACx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+cx^3 &= cAx^3 + 3cABx^4 + \\ldots \\\\\n+dx^4 &= dAx^4 + \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand, putting the coefficients of \\( x, x^2, x^3, \\ldots \\) each \\(=0\\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\naA &= 0 \\\\\naB + bA &= 0 \\\\\naC + 2bAB + cA &= 0 \\\\\naD + 2bAC + bB + 3cAB + dA &= 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nthese equations give\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nA &= \\frac{1}{a} \\\\\nB &= \\frac{-b}{a^2} \\\\\nC &= \\frac{2b^2 - ac}{a^5} \\\\\nD &= \\frac{5b^3 - 5abc + a^2d}{a^7}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nTherefore \\( x = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{b}{a^2}x^2 + \\frac{2b^2 - ac}{a^5}x^3 - \\frac{5b^3 - 5abc + a^2d}{a^7}x^4 + \\ldots \\)\n\n---\n\n273. As an example of the application of this formula, let it be required to determine \\( x \\) from the equation\n\n\\[\ny = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nIn this case we have\n\n\\[\nz = y, \\quad a = 1, \\quad b = -\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad c = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad d = -\\frac{1}{4}, \\quad \\ldots\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting these values, we have\n\n\\[\nx = y + \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{6} + \\frac{y^4}{24} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n---\n\n274. In the equation\n\n\\[\nay + by^2 + cy^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nin which both sides are expressed by series, and it is required to find \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\), we must assume, as before,\n\n\\[\ny = Ax + Bx^2 + Cx^3 + Dx^4 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand substitute this series and its powers for \\( y \\) and its powers in the proposed equation, afterwards, by bringing all the terms to one side, and making the coefficients of each power of \\( y \\) \\(=0\\), a series of equations will be had by which the quantities \\( A, B, C, D, \\ldots \\) may be determined.\n\n---\n\nSect. XIX. Of Logarithms and Exponential Quantities.\n\n275. All positive numbers may be considered as powers of any one given affirmative number. The powers of 2 for instance may become equal, either exactly, or nearer than by any assignable difference, to all numbers whatever, from 0 upwards. If the exponents be integers we shall have only the numbers which form the geometrical progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &c. but the intermediate numbers may be expressed, at least nearly, by means of fractional exponents. Thus the numbers from 0 to 10 may be expressed by the powers of 2 as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2^0 &= 1 \\\\\n2^{1.585} &= 6 \\\\\n2^{2.897} &= 7 \\\\\n2^{3.322} &= 8 \\\\\n2^{3.710} &= 9 \\\\\n2^{3.922} &= 10\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIn like manner may fractions be expressed by the powers of 2. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2} &= 2^{-1} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{1.585}} &= 2^{-1.585} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{2.897}} &= 2^{-2.897} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.322}} &= 2^{-3.322} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.710}} &= 2^{-3.710} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2^{3.922}} &= 2^{-3.922}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhere it is observable that the exponents are now negative.\n\nIn the same manner may all numbers be expressed by the powers of 10. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n10^0 &= 1 \\\\\n10^{-1} &= \\frac{1}{10} \\\\\n10^{-1.585} &= \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n10^{-2.897} &= \\frac{1}{7} \\\\\n10^{-3.322} &= \\frac{1}{8} \\\\\n10^{-3.710} &= \\frac{1}{9} \\\\\n10^{-3.922} &= \\frac{1}{10}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\n---\n\n276. Even a fraction might be taken in place of 2, or 10, in the preceding examples, and such exponents might be found as would give its powers equal to all numbers from 0 upwards. There are therefore no limitations with respect to the magnitude of the number, by the powers of which all other numbers are to be expressed, except that it must neither be equal to unity, nor negative. If it were \\(=1\\), then all its powers would also be \\(=1\\), and if it were negative, there are numbers to which none of its powers could possibly be equal.\n\n277. If therefore \\( y \\) denote any number whatever, and \\( r \\) a given number, a number \\( x \\) may be found, such, that \\( r^x = y \\), and \\( x \\), that is the exponent of \\( r \\) which gives a number equal to \\( y \\), is called the logarithm of \\( y \\).\n\n278. The given number \\( r \\), by the powers of which all other numbers are expressed, is called the radical number of the logarithms which are the indices of those powers.\n\n279. From the preceding definition of logarithms their properties are easily deduced, as follows:\n\n1. The sum of two logarithms is equal to the logarithm of their product. Let \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\) be two numbers, and \\( x \\) and \\( x' \\) their logarithms, so that \\( r^x = y \\), and \\( r^{x'} = y' \\), then \\( r^x \\times r^{x'} = y \\times y' \\), hence, from the definition, \\( x + x' \\) is the logarithm of \\( yy' \\), that is the sum of the logarithms of \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\) is the logarithm of \\( yy' \\).\n\n2. The difference of the logarithms of two numbers is equal to the logarithm of their quotient; for if\nALGEBRA.\n\nOf Logarithms, &c., if \\( r^n = y \\) and \\( r^m = y' \\), then \\( \\frac{r^n}{r^m} = \\frac{y}{y'} \\) or \\( r^{n-m} = \\frac{y}{y'} \\),\n\ntherefore, by the definition, \\( x - x' \\) is the logarithm of \\( \\frac{y}{y'} \\); that is the difference of the logarithms of \\( y \\) and \\( y' \\)\n\nis the logarithm of \\( \\frac{y}{y'} \\).\n\n3. Let \\( n \\) be any number whatever; then, \\( \\log_N N^n = n \\times \\log_N N \\). For \\( N^n \\) is \\( N \\) multiplied into itself \\( n \\) times, therefore the logarithm of \\( N^n \\) is equal the logarithm of \\( N \\) added to itself \\( n \\) times, or to \\( n \\times \\log_N N \\).\n\n280. From these properties of logarithms it follows, that if we possess tables by which we can assign the logarithm corresponding to any given number, and also the number corresponding to any given logarithm, the operations of multiplication and division of numbers may be reduced to the addition and subtraction of their logarithms, and the operations of involution and evolution to the more simple operations of multiplication and division. Thus if two numbers \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are to be multiplied together, by taking the sum of their logarithms, we obtain the logarithm of their product, and, by inspecting the table, the product itself. A similar observation applies to the quotient of two numbers and also to any power or to any root of a number.\n\n281. The general properties of logarithms are independent of any particular value of the radical number, and hence there may be various systems of logarithms, according to the radical number employed in their construction. Thus if the radical number be \\( r \\), we shall have the common system of logarithms, but if it were \\( 27182818 \\) we should have the logarithms first constructed by Lord Napier, which are called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\n282. We have already observed (\\$ 277), that the relation between any number and its logarithm is expressed by the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( y \\) denotes a number, \\( x \\) its logarithm, and \\( r \\) the radical number of the system, and any two of these three quantities being given, the remaining one may be found. If either \\( y \\) or \\( r \\) were the quantity required, the question would involve no difficulty; if, however, the exponent \\( x \\) were considered as the unknown quantity while \\( r \\) and \\( y \\) were supposed given, the equation to be resolved would be of a different form than any that we have hitherto considered: Equations of this form are called exponential equations, to resolve such an equation is evidently the same thing as to determine the logarithm of a given number, and this problem we shall now proceed to investigate.\n\n283. We therefore resolve the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( r, x, \\) and \\( y \\) denote as before, we are to find a value of \\( x \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( y \\). Let us suppose \\( r = 1 + a \\) and \\( y = 1 + v \\), then, our equation will stand thus\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + v.\n\\]\n\nSo that, by raising both sides to the power \\( n \\), where \\( n \\) denotes an indefinite number, which is to disappear in the course of the investigation, we have \\( (1 + a)^n = (1 + v)^n \\), and resolving both sides of the equation into series by means of the binomial theorem,\n\n\\[\n1 + nx + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 1 + nv + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} v^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} v^3 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, subtracting unity from both sides, and dividing by \\( n \\), we have\n\n\\[\nxa + \\frac{x(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{x(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\frac{n-1}{1 \\cdot 2} v^2 + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} v^3 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nand by supposing the factors which constitute the terms of each series to be actually multiplied, and the products arranged according to the powers of \\( n \\), the last equation will have this form\n\n\\[\nxa + \\left( Pn + Qn^2 + \\frac{x}{3} a^3 + \\left( P'n + Q'n^2 + Rn^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots \\right),\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\left( pn + qn^2 + \\frac{v}{3} a^3 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 + r'n^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots \\right).\n\\]\n\nHere the coefficients of the powers of \\( n \\), viz. \\( P, P', P'', \\ldots \\), \\( Q, Q', Q'', \\ldots \\), \\( R, R', R'', \\ldots \\), also \\( p, p', p'', \\ldots \\), \\( q, q', q'', \\ldots \\), \\( r, r', r'', \\ldots \\), are expressions which denote certain combinations of the powers of \\( x \\) in the first series, and certain numbers in the second; but as they are all to vanish in the course of the investigation, it is not necessary that they should be expressed in any other way than by a single letter.\n\n284. Now each side of this last equation may evidently be resolved into two parts, one of which is entirely free from the quantity \\( n \\), and the other involves that quantity, hence the same equation may also stand thus,\n\n\\[\nxa + \\frac{x}{2} a^2 + \\frac{x}{3} a^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ Pna^2 + \\left( P'n + Q'n^2 + Rn^3 \\right) a^4 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= v + \\frac{v}{2} v^2 + \\frac{v}{3} v^3 + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n+ pnv^2 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 \\right) v^3 + \\left( p'n + q'n^2 + r'n^3 \\right) v^4 + \\cdots.\n\\]\n\nThis equation must hold true, whatever be the value of \\( n \\), which is a quantity entirely arbitrary, and therefore ought to vanish from the equation expressing the relation between \\( x \\) and \\( v \\); hence it follows that the terms on each side of the equation, which involve \\( n \\), ought to destroy each other, and thus there will remain\nmain only the part of each side, which does not involve logarithms, &c., that is\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nor \\( (x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\ldots) \\)\n\nLet us now put \\( A \\) to denote the constant multiplier\n\n\\[ a = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand substitute for \\( v \\), its value \\( y - 1 \\), thus we at last find\n\n\\[ x = \\log_y = \\frac{1}{A}(y - 1) - \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y - 1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(y - 1)^4}{4} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand by this formula the logarithm of any number a little greater than unity may be readily found.\n\n285. If \\( y \\) be nearly \\( = 2 \\) the series will, however, converge too slowly to be of use, and if it exceed \\( 2 \\), the series will diverge, and therefore cannot be directly applied to the finding of its logarithm. But a series which shall converge faster and be applicable to every case may be investigated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nBut \\( \\log_n = \\log_n + \\log_z \\), therefore\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\log_n + \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nThis series gives the logarithm of \\( n + z \\) by means of the logarithm of \\( n \\), and converges very fast when \\( n \\) is considerable.\n\n287. It appears from the series which have been found for \\( \\log_y \\) in § 284 and 285, that the logarithm of a number is always the product of two quantities; one of these is variable, and depends upon the number itself, but the other, viz. \\( \\frac{1}{A} \\), is constant, and depends entirely on the radical number of the system. This quantity has been called by writers on logarithms the modulus of the system.\n\n288. The most simple system of logarithms in respect to facility of computation is that in which \\( \\frac{1}{A} = 1 \\) or \\( A = 1 \\). The logarithms of this system are the same as those first invented by Napier, and are also called hyperbolic logarithms.\n\nThe hyperbolic logarithm of any numbers, \\( y \\) is therefore (\\$ 284)\n\n\\[ y - 1 = \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(y - 1)^3}{3} + \\ldots \\]\n\nand that of \\( r \\), the radical number of any system is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{v^2}{2} + \\frac{v^3}{3} - \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nBecause \\( \\log_r(1 + v) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{v^2}{2} + \\frac{v^3}{3} - \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\)\n\nBy substituting \\( -v \\) for \\( +v \\) we have\n\n\\[ \\log_r(1 - v) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( -\\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{v^3}{3} + \\frac{v^4}{4} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nNow, \\( \\log_r(1 + v) - \\log_r(1 - v) = \\log_r \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} \\),\n\ntherefore, subtracting the latter series from the former we have\n\n\\[ \\log_r \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( 2v + \\frac{2v^3}{3} + \\frac{2v^5}{5} + \\frac{2v^7}{7} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nPut \\( \\frac{1 + v}{1 - v} = y \\), then \\( v = \\frac{y - 1}{y + 1} \\) and the last series becomes\n\n\\[ \\log_r y = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{2(y - 1)}{y + 1} + \\frac{2(y - 1)^3}{3(y + 1)^3} + \\frac{2(y - 1)^5}{5(y + 1)^5} + \\ldots \\right) \\]\n\nThis series will always converge whatever be the value of \\( y \\), and by means of it the logarithms of small numbers may be found with great facility.\n\n286. When a number is composite, its logarithm will most easily be found, by adding together the logarithms of its factors; but if it be a prime number, its logarithm may be derived from that of some convenient composite number, either greater or less and an infinite series. Let \\( n \\) be a number of which the logarithm is already found; then substituting \\( \\frac{n + z}{n} \\) for \\( y \\) in the last formula we have\n\n\\[ \\log_n = \\frac{1}{A}(2z + z^2) + \\frac{1}{3}(2z + z^3) + \\frac{1}{5}(2z + z^5) + \\ldots \\]\n\nbut this last series is the same as we have denoted by \\( A \\); hence it follows, that the modulus of any system is the reciprocal of the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of that system. Thus it appears, that the logarithms of numbers, according to any proposed system, may be readily found from the hyperbolic logarithm of the same numbers, and the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of that system.\n\n289. Let \\( L \\) denote the hyp. log. of any number, and \\( l, l' \\) the logarithms of the same number according to two other systems whose moduli are \\( m \\) and \\( m' \\); then\n\n\\[ l = mL, \\quad l' = m'L \\]\n\ntherefore \\( \\frac{l}{m} = \\frac{l'}{m'} \\) and \\( m : m' :: l : l' \\)\n\nThat is, the logarithms of the same number, according to different systems, are directly proportional to the moduli of those systems, and therefore have a given ratio to one another.\n\n290. We shall now apply the series here investigated to the calculation of the hyperbolic logarithm of 10, the reciprocal of which is the modulus of the common system.\nOf Logarithms; and also to the calculation of logarithms, &c.\n\nThe hyp. log. of 10 may be obtained by substituting 10 for \\( y \\) in the formula\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } y = \\frac{2(y-1)}{y+1} + \\frac{2(y-1)^3}{3(y+1)} + \\frac{2(y-1)^5}{5(y+1)} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nbut the resulting series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2^9}{11} + \\frac{2^9}{3 \\cdot 11^3} + \\frac{2^9}{5 \\cdot 11^5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nconverges too slowly to be of any practical utility, it will therefore be better to derive the logarithm of 10 from those of 2 and 5. By substituting 2 in the formula we have\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} + \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 3^7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthis series converges very fast, so that by reducing its terms to decimal fractions, and taking the sum of the first seven terms we find the hyp. log. of 2 to be 0.6931472.\n\nThe hyp. log. of 5 may be found in the same manner, but more easily from the formula given in § 286. For the log. of 2 being given, that of 4 = 2² is also given § 279. Therefore, substituting log. 4 = 2 log. 2 for log. n, and 1 for \\( x \\), in the series\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } (n+x) = \\text{hyp. log. } n + 2 \\left( \\frac{x}{2n+x} + \\frac{x^3}{7(2n+x)^3} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 5 = \\text{hyp. log. } 2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{3^3} + \\frac{1}{5 \\cdot 3^5} + \\ldots \\right)\n\\]\n\nThe first three terms of this series are sufficient to give the result true to the seventh decimal, so that we have hyp. log. 5 = 1.6931479, and\n\n\\[\n\\text{hyp. log. } 10 = \\text{hyp. log. } 2 + \\text{hyp. log. } 5 = 2.3025851.\n\\]\n\nHence the modulus of the common system of logarithms, or\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\text{hyp. log. } 10}\n\\]\n\nis found = 0.4342945. The same number, because of its great utility in the construction of tables of logarithms, has been calculated to a much greater number of decimals. A celebrated calculator of the last century, Mr. A. Sharp, found it to be\n\n\\[\n0.434294481902351827651128918916605082294397005803666566114454.\n\\]\n\nHaving found the hyp. log. of 2 to be 0.6931472 the common logarithm of 2 is had immediately, by multiplying the hyp. log. of 2 by the modulus of the system, thus we find\n\n\\[\n\\text{com. log. } 2 = 0.4342945 \\times 0.6931472 = 0.3010300.\n\\]\n\n291. We have already observed § 282, that to determine the logarithm of a given number, is the same problem as to determine the value of \\( x \\) in an equation of this form \\( a^x = b \\), where the unknown quantity is an exponent. But in order to resolve such an equation, it is not necessary to have recourse to series; for a table of logarithms being once supposed constructed, the value of \\( x \\) may be determined thus. It appears from § 279, that \\( x \\times \\log. a = \\log. b \\). Hence it follows,\n\nVol. I. Part II.\n\nthat \\( x = \\frac{\\log. b}{\\log. a} \\). The use of this formula will appear in next section which treats of computations relative to annuities.\n\n292. The theory of logarithms requires the solution of this other problem. Having given the radical number of a system, and a logarithm, to determine the corresponding number. Or having given the equation \\( r^n = y \\), where \\( r \\), \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) denote as in § 282, to find a series which shall express \\( y \\) in terms of \\( r \\) and \\( x \\).\n\n293. For this purpose, let us suppose \\( r = 1 + a \\), then our equation becomes \\( y = (1 + a)^x \\), which, may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[\ny = [(1 + a)^x]^n\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is an indefinite quantity, which is to disappear in the course of the investigation.\n\nBy the binomial theorem we have\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + na + \\frac{n(n-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} a^2 + \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} a^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nthis equation, by multiplying together the factors which compose the terms of the series, and arranging the results according to the powers of \\( n \\), may also be expressed thus\n\n\\[\n(1 + a)^n = 1 + An + Bn^2 + Cn^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhere it will readily appear that\n\n\\[\nA = a - \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} - \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nas to the values of \\( B \\), \\( C \\), &c., it is of no importance to know them, for they will all disappear in the course of the investigation. Hence, by substituting for \\( (1 + a)^n \\) its value, as expressed by the last series, we have\n\n\\[\ny = (1 + An + Bn^2 + Cn^3 + \\ldots)^n\n\\]\n\nand expanding the latter part of this equation by means of the binomial theorem it becomes\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + \\frac{x}{n}(An + Bn^2 + \\ldots) + \\frac{x(x-n)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot n^2}(An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nBut \\( An + Bn^2 + \\ldots = n(A + Bn + \\ldots) \\) also \\( (An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^2 = n^2(A + Bn + \\ldots)^2 \\), and \\( (An + Bn^2 + \\ldots)^3 = n^3(A + Bn + \\ldots)^3 \\), &c., therefore, by leaving out of each term of the series the powers of \\( n \\) which are common to the numerator and denominator, the equation will stand thus\n\n\\[\ny = 1 + x(A + Bn + \\ldots) + \\frac{x(x-n)}{1 \\cdot 2}(A + Bn + \\ldots)^2 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nNow \\( n \\) is here an arbitrary quantity, and ought, from the nature of the original equation, to disappear from the value of \\( y \\); the terms of the equation which are multiplied\nInterest and multiplied by \\( n \\) ought therefore to destroy each other; and this being the case, the equation is reduced to\n\n\\[\nr^n = y = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2 A}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3 A^2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^4 A^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand since we have found\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^3}{3} + \\frac{a^4}{4} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= (r-1)^2 + \\frac{(r-1)^3}{3} - \\frac{(r-1)^4}{4}\n\\]\n\nIt is evident from § 288 that \\( A \\) is the hyperbolic logarithm of the radical number of the system.\n\n294. If in the equation \\( r^n = y \\) we suppose \\( x = 1 \\), the value of \\( y \\) becomes\n\n\\[\nr = 1 + \\frac{A}{1} + \\frac{A^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{A^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nHere the radical number is expressed by means of its hyperbolic logarithm. Again, if we suppose \\( x = \\frac{1}{A} \\), then\n\n\\[\nr^{\\frac{1}{A}} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThus it appears that the quantity \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} \\) is equal to a constant number, which, by taking the sum of a sufficient number of terms of the series, will be found \\( = 2.718281828459045 \\ldots \\). Let us denote this number by \\( e \\), then \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), and hence \\( r = e^A \\). Now if we remark that \\( A \\) is the hyp. log. of \\( r \\) it must be evident (\\$ 277 and 278) that \\( e \\) is the radical number of the hyperbolic system of logarithms.\n\nAgain, since \\( r^{\\frac{1}{A}} = e \\), therefore \\( \\frac{1}{A} \\times \\log_r r = \\log_e e \\)\n\nand \\( A = \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\), here \\( \\log_r r \\) and \\( \\log_e e \\) denote logarithms taken according to any system whatever.\n\n295. If we now resume the equation,\n\n\\[\nr^n = y = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2 A}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3 A^2}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand substitute for \\( A \\) its value \\( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\) we shall have the following general expression for any exponential quantity whatever\n\n\\[\nr^n = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right) + \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right)^2 + \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\left( \\frac{\\log_r r}{\\log_e e} \\right)^3 + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich by supposing \\( r = e \\) becomes\n\n\\[\ne^n = 1 + \\frac{x}{1} + \\frac{x^2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nSect. XX. Of Interest and Annuities.\n\n296 The theory of logarithms finds its application in some measure to calculations relating to interest and annuities; these we now proceed to explain. There are two hypotheses, according to either of which money put out at interest may be supposed to be improved. We may suppose that the interest, which is always proportional to the sum lent, or principal, is also proportional to the time during which the principal is employed; and on this hypothesis the money is said to be improved at simple interest. Or we may suppose that the interest, which ought to be paid to the lender at successive stated periods, is added to the principal instead of being actually paid, and thus their amount converted into a new principal; when money is laid out according to this second hypothesis, it is said to be improved at compound interest.\n\n297. In calculations relating to interest, the things to be considered are the principal, or sum lent; the rate of interest, or sum paid for the use of 100l. for one year; the time during which the principal is lent; and the amount, or sum of the principal and interest at the end of that time.\n\nLet \\( p \\) denote the principal, 1l. being the unit.\n\n\\( r \\) the interest of 1l. for one year, at the given rate.\n\n\\( t \\) the time, one year being the unit.\n\n\\( a \\) the amount.\n\nWe shall now examine the relations which subsist between those quantities, according to each of the two hypotheses of simple and compound interest.\n\nI. Simple Interest.\n\n298. Because the interest of 1l. for one year is \\( r \\), the interest of 1l. for \\( t \\) years must be \\( rt \\), and the interest of \\( p \\) pounds for the same time \\( prt \\), hence we have this formula\n\n\\[\np + prt = a\n\\]\n\nfrom which we find\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{a}{1 + rt}, \\quad r = \\frac{a - p}{pt}, \\quad t = \\frac{a - p}{pr}\n\\]\n\nAs the manner of applying these formulae to questions relating to simple interest is sufficiently obvious, we proceed to consider compound interest.\n\nII. Compound Interest.\n\n299. In addition to the symbols already assumed, let \\( R = 1 + rt \\) amount of 1l. in one year, then, from the nature of compound interest, \\( R \\) is also the principal at the beginning of the second year. Now, interest being always proportional to the principal we have\n\n\\[\n1 : r : : R : rR = \\text{the interest of } R \\text{ for a year},\n\\]\n\nand \\( R + rR = (1 + r)R = R^2 = \\text{amount of } R \\text{ in a year}, \\)\n\ntherefore \\( R^2 \\) is the amount of 1l. in two years, which sum being assumed as a new principal, we find, as before, its interest for a year to be \\( rR^2 \\), and its amount \\( R^2 + rR^2 = (1 + r)R^2 = R^3 \\); so that \\( R^3 \\) is the amount of 1l. in three years. Proceeding in this manner we find in general that the amount of 1l. in \\( t \\) years is \\( R^t \\), and of \\( p \\) pounds \\( pR^t \\), hence we have this formula\n\n\\[\npR^t = a\n\\]\nAnnuities, which from the nature of logarithms may also be expressed thus:\n\n\\[ \\log_p + t \\times \\log_R = \\log_a \\]\n\nHence we find\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{a}{R^t} \\quad R = t \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{p}} \\]\n\nor, by logarithms,\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - t \\times \\log_R \\quad \\log_R = \\frac{\\log_a - \\log_p}{t} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{\\log_a - \\log_p}{\\log_R} \\]\n\n300. As an example of the use of these formulas, let it be required to determine what sum improved at 5 per cent. compound interest will amount to £500 in 42 years. In this case we have given \\( a = 500 \\), \\( r = 0.05 \\), \\( R = 1.05 \\), \\( t = 42 \\), to find \\( p \\).\n\nFrom\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - \\log_R = 2.6989700 \\]\nsubtract\n\\[ t \\times \\log_R = 42 \\times \\log_1.05 = 0.8899506 \\]\n\nremains \\( \\log_p = 1.8090194 \\)\n\ntherefore \\( p = 64.421 = 64l. 8s. 5d. \\) the sum required.\n\nEx. 2. In what time will a sum laid out at 4 per cent. compound interest be doubled.\n\nLet any sum be expressed by unity, then we have given \\( p = 1 \\), \\( r = 0.04 \\), \\( R = 1.04 \\), \\( a = 2 \\), to find \\( t \\).\n\nFrom the formula\n\n\\[ \\log_p = \\log_a - \\log_R = \\log_2 \\]\n\\[ \\log_R = \\log_1.04 \\]\n\nwe find \\( t = \\frac{3010300}{0170333} = 17.7 \\) years nearly.\n\n301. In treating of compound interest we have supposed the interest to be joined to the principal at the end of every year. But we might have supposed it to be added at the end of every half year or every quarter, or even every instant, and suitable rules might have been found for performing calculations according to each hypothesis. As such suppositions are, however, never made in actual business, we shall not at present pay any thing more of them.\n\nIII. Annuities.\n\n302. An annuity is a payment made annually for a term of years, and the chief problem relating to it is to determine its present worth, that is the sum a person ought to pay immediately to another, upon condition of receiving from the latter a certain sum annually for a given time. In resolving this problem, it is supposed that the buyer improves his annuity from the time he receives it, and the seller the purchase money in a certain manner during the continuance of the annuity, so that at the end of the time, the amount of each may be the same. There may be various suppositions as to the way in which the annuity and its purchase money may be improved; but the only one commonly applied to practice is the highest improvement possible of both, viz. by compound interest. As the taking compound interest is, however, prohibited by law, the realizing of this supposed improvement requires punctual payment of interest, and therefore the interest in such calculations is usually made low.\n\n303. Let \\( A \\) denote the annuity;\n\\( P \\) the present worth, or purchase money;\n\\( t \\) the time of its continuance;\nlet \\( r \\) and \\( R \\) denote as before.\n\nThe seller, by improving the price \\( P \\) at compound interest during the time \\( t \\), has \\( PR^t \\).\n\nThe purchaser is supposed to receive the first annuity \\( A \\) at the end of one year, which being improved for \\( t-1 \\) years amounts to \\( AR^{t-1} \\). He receives the second year's annuity at the end of the second year, which being improved for \\( t-2 \\) years amounts to \\( AR^{t-2} \\). In like manner the third year's annuity becomes \\( AR^{t-3} \\), and so on to the last year's annuity, which is simply \\( A \\). Therefore, the whole amount of the improved annuities is the geometrical series.\n\n\\[ A + AR + AR^2 + AR^3 + \\ldots + AR^{t-1} \\]\n\nthe sum of which, by § 106, is \\( A \\frac{R^t - 1}{R - 1} = A \\frac{R^t - 1}{r} \\),\n\nand since this sum must be equal to the amount of the purchase money, or \\( PR^t \\), we have\n\n\\[ PR^t = A \\frac{R^t - 1}{r} \\]\n\nand from this equation, we find\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\quad A = \\frac{PR^t}{R^t - 1} = \\frac{\\log A - \\log (A - rP)}{\\log R} \\]\n\nAs to \\( r \\), it can only be found by the resolution of an equation of the \\( t \\) order.\n\n304. To find the present value of an annuity in reversion, that is an annuity which is to commence at the end of \\( n \\) years, and continue during \\( t \\) years; first find its value for \\( n+t \\) years, and then for \\( n \\) years, and subtract the latter from the former. We thus obtain the following formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\n305. If the annuity is to commence immediately, and to continue for ever, then, because in this case \\( R^t \\) is infinitely great, and therefore \\( \\frac{1}{R^t} = 0 \\), the formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{r} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\nbecomes simply \\( P = \\frac{A}{r} \\).\n\nAnd if the annuity is to commence after \\( n \\) years and continue for ever, the formula\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{R^t} \\right) \\]\n\nbecomes \\( P = \\frac{A}{rR^n} \\).\n\nSect. XXI. Of continued Fractions.\n\n306. Every quantity which admits of being expressed by a common fraction may also be expressed in\nthe form of what is called a continued fraction. The nature of such fractions will be easily understood by the following example.\n\nLet the common fraction be $\\frac{314159}{100000}$, or which is the same $3 + \\frac{14159}{10000}$. Since $10000 = 7 \\times 14159 + 887$, therefore $\\frac{14159}{10000} = \\frac{14159}{7 \\times 14159 + 887} = \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{887}{14159}}$ and\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{887}{14159}}.$$  \n\nNow $\\frac{887}{14159} = \\frac{887}{15 \\times 887 + 854} = \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{854}{887}}$, and substituting this for $\\frac{887}{15159}$ in the value of $\\frac{314159}{100000}$ already found we have\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{854}{887}}}.$$  \n\nAgain, $\\frac{854}{887} = \\frac{854}{854 + 33} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{33}{854}}$, which being substituted as before, gives\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}}}}}.$$  \n\nBy operations similar to the preceding we find\n\n$$\\frac{33}{854} = \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{29}{33}}, \\quad \\frac{29}{33} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4}{29}}, \\quad \\frac{4}{29} = \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}},$$  \n\ntherefore, by substitution\n\n$$\\frac{314159}{100000} = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{25 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{4}}}}}.$$  \n\nBy an operation, in all respects the same as has been just now performed may any fraction whatever be reduced to the form\n\n$$a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\ldots}}},$$  \n\nand it is then called a continued fraction.\n\n307. It is easy to see in what manner the inverse of the preceding operation is to be performed, or a continued fraction reduced to a common fraction.\n\nThus if the continued fraction be\n\n$$a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d + \\ldots}}},$$  \n\nit will evidently be reduced to a common fraction by adding the reciprocal of $d$ to $b$, and the reciprocal of that sum to $b$, and again the reciprocal of this last sum to $a$; now the reciprocal of $d$, or $\\frac{1}{d}$ added to $c$ is $c + \\frac{1}{d} = \\frac{cd + 1}{d}$, again the reciprocal of this sum, or $\\frac{d}{cd + 1}$, added to $b$ is $b + \\frac{d}{cd + 1} = \\frac{bcd + b + d}{cd + 1}$, and the reciprocal of this last quantity, viz. $\\frac{cd + 1}{bcd + b + d}$ when added to $a$ gives\n\n$$\\frac{abcd + ab + ad + cd + 1}{bcd + b + d} = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{c + \\frac{1}{d}}}.$$  \n\n308. This manner of expressing a fraction enables us to find a series of other fractions, that approach in value to any given one, and each of them expressed in the smallest numbers possible. Thus in the example $\\frac{314159}{100000}$ which has been resolved into a continued fraction, § 306, and which is known to express nearly the proportion of the diameter of a circle to its circumference; if we take only the first two terms of the continued fraction, and put $\\pi$ for $\\frac{314159}{100000}$, we shall have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nnearly, and this is the proportion which was found by Archimedes.\n\nAgain by taking the first three terms we have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{106} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nwhich is nearer the truth than the former.\n\nAnd by taking the first four terms we have\n\n$$\\pi = 3 + \\frac{1}{7 + \\frac{1}{15 + \\frac{1}{13}}} = 3.\\overline{142857}$$  \n\nwhich is the proportion assigned by Metius, and is more exact than either of the preceding. These results are alternately greater and less than the truth.\n\n309. Among continued fractions, those have been particularly distinguished in which the denominators, after a certain number of changes, are continually repeated in the same order. Such for example is the fraction\n\n$$1 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\ldots}}}},$$  \n\nThe amount of this fraction, though continued ad infinitum, may be easily found; for leaving out the first term, which is an integer, let us suppose\n\n$$x = \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{3 + \\ldots}}}},$$  \n\nThen since after the second, all the terms return in the\nContinued the same order, it follows that their amount is also \\( x \\), thus we have\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3 + x}\n\\]\n\nHence \\( x = \\frac{3 + x}{6 + 2x + 1} \\) and \\( x^2 + 3x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) and \\( x = \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{15}}{2} \\)\n\nTherefore \\( x + 1 \\), or the sum of the series, \\( = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{15}}{2} \\)\n\nIn general if \\( x = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\ldots \\), &c.\n\nwe find \\( x = \\frac{b}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{4} + \\frac{b}{a}} \\). Though the denominators did not return in the same order till after a greater interval, the value of the fraction would still be expressed by the root of a quadratic equation. And conversely, the roots of all quadratic equations may be expressed by periodical continued fractions, and may often by that means be very readily approximated in numbers, without the trouble of extracting the square root.\n\n310. The reduction of a decimal into the form of a continued fraction sometimes renders the law of its continuation evident. Thus we know that \\( \\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356 \\ldots \\) but from the bare inspection of this decimal we discover no rule for its further continuation. If, however, it be reduced into a continued fraction, it becomes\n\n\\[\n= 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2 + \\frac{1}{2 + \\ldots}} , \\text{&c.}\n\\]\n\nand hence we see it what way it may be continued to any degree of accuracy.\n\n311. When the root of any equation is found by the method explained in § 256, the value of the unknown quantity is evidently expressed by a continued fraction.\n\nFor if \\( x \\) be the root sought, we have \\( x = a + \\frac{1}{y}, y = b + \\frac{1}{y'}, y' = b' + \\frac{1}{y''}, y'' = b'' + \\frac{1}{y'''}, \\ldots \\), where \\( a, b', b'', \\ldots \\) denote the whole numbers, which are next less than the true values of \\( x, y, y', y'' \\), &c. If therefore in the value of \\( x \\) we substitute \\( b + \\frac{1}{y'} \\), for \\( y \\), it becomes\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{y'}}\n\\]\n\nAgain, if in this second value of \\( x \\) we substitute \\( b' + \\frac{1}{y''} \\) for \\( y \\) it becomes\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{b' + \\frac{1}{y''}}}\n\\]\n\nThe next value of \\( x \\) is in like manner found to be\n\n\\[\nx = a + \\frac{1}{b + \\frac{1}{b' + \\frac{1}{b'' + \\frac{1}{y'''}}}}\n\\]\n\nand so on continually.\n\nSect. XXII. Of Indeterminate Problems.\n\n312. When the conditions of a question are such that the number of equations exceeds the number of unknown quantities, that question will admit of innumerable solutions, and is therefore said to be indeterminate. Thus, if it be required to find two numbers subject to no other limitation than that their sum be 12, we have two unknown quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and only one equation, viz. \\( x + y = 12 \\), which may evidently be satisfied by innumerable different values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), if fractional solutions be admitted. It is, however, usual in such questions as this, to restrict the values of the numbers sought to positive integers, and therefore, in this case, we can have only these nine solutions;\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \\\\\ny &= 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhich indeed may be reduced to five, for the first four become the same as the last four, by simply changing \\( x \\) into \\( y \\), and the contrary.\n\n313. Indeterminate problems are of different orders according to the dimensions of the equation which is obtained after all the unknown quantities, but two have been exterminated by means of the given equations. Those of the first order lead always to equations of this form,\n\n\\[\nax + by = c,\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a, b, c \\) denote given whole numbers, and \\( x, y \\) two numbers to be found, so that both may be integers. That this condition may be fulfilled, it is necessary that the coefficients \\( a, b \\) have no common divisor which is not also a divisor of \\( c \\); for if \\( a = md \\) and \\( b = me \\), then \\( ax + by = mdx + mey = c \\), and \\( dx + ey = \\frac{c}{m} \\); but \\( d, e, x, y \\) are supposed to be whole numbers, therefore \\( \\frac{c}{m} \\) is a whole number, hence \\( m \\) must be a divisor of \\( c \\).\n\n314. We proceed to illustrate the manner of resolving indeterminate equations of the first order by some numerical examples.\n\nEx. 1. Given \\( 2x + 3y = 25 \\), to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in whole positive numbers.\n\nFrom the given equation we have \\( x = \\frac{25 - 3y}{2} = 12 - y + \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\); now since \\( x \\) must be a whole number it follows that \\( \\frac{1 - y}{2} \\) must be a whole number. Let us assume \\( \\frac{1 - y}{2} = z \\), then \\( 1 - y = 2z \\) and \\( y = 1 - 2z \\), and since \\( x = 12 - y + \\frac{1 - y}{2} = 12 - y + z \\), therefore \\( x = 12 - 1 + 2z + z \\); hence we have\n\n\\[\nx = 11 + 3z, \\quad y = 1 - 2z\n\\]\nwhere \\( z \\) might be any whole number whatever, if there were no limitation as to the signs of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\); but since these quantities are required to be positive, it is evident from the value of \\( y \\), that \\( z \\) must either be 0 or negative, and from the value of \\( x \\) that, abstracting from the sign, it must be less than 4; hence \\( z \\) may have these three values 0, -1, -2, -3.\n\nIf \\( z = 0 \\), \\( z = -1 \\), \\( z = -2 \\), \\( z = -3 \\).\n\nThen \\( \\{x = 11, y = 8, z = 5, y = 2\\} \\)\n\n\\( \\{y = 1, y = 3, y = 5, y = 7\\} \\)\n\nEx. 2. It is required to divide 100 into such parts that the one may be divisible by 7 and the other by 11.\n\nLet 7 \\( x \\) be the first part, and 11 \\( y \\) the second, then by the question \\( 7x + 11y = 100 \\), and\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{100 - 11y}{7} = 14 - y + \\frac{2 - 4y}{7}; \\]\n\nhence it appears that \\( \\frac{2 - 4y}{7} \\) must be a whole number. Let us assume \\( \\frac{2 - 4y}{7} = z \\), then \\( s = 14 - y + z \\) and\n\n\\[ 4y = 2 - 7z \\text{ or } y = \\frac{2 - 7z}{4} = \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} - z, \\text{ therefore } \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} \\]\n\nmust be a whole number. Assume \\( \\frac{2 - 3z}{4} = t \\), then \\( y = t - z \\), and \\( 3z = 2 - 4t \\), or \\( z = \\frac{2 - 4t}{3} = \\frac{2 - t}{3} \\), therefore \\( \\frac{2 - t}{3} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume now \\( \\frac{2 - t}{3} = v \\), then \\( z = v - t \\) and \\( t = 2 - 3v \\), here it is evident \\( v \\) may be any whole number taken at pleasure, so that to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) we have the following series of equations:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{2 - 3v}{3} \\]\n\\[ z = v - t = 4v - 2 \\]\n\\[ y = t - z = 4 - 7v \\]\n\\[ w = 14 - y + z = 11v + 8. \\]\n\nNow from the value of \\( y \\) it appears, that \\( v \\) must either be 0, or negative; but from the value of \\( x \\) we find that \\( v \\) cannot be a negative whole number, therefore \\( v \\) can only be 0; hence the only values which \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can have in whole numbers are \\( x = 8, y = 4 \\).\n\nEx. 3. It is required to find all the possible ways in which 60l. can be paid in guineas and moidores only.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of guineas and \\( y \\) the number of moidores. Then the value of the guineas, expressed in shillings, is 21x, and that of the moidores 27y, therefore from the nature of the question 21x + 27y = 1200, or, dividing the equation by 3, 7x + 9y = 400, hence \\( x = \\frac{400 - 9y}{7} = 57 - y + \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\), so that \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} = x \\), then \\( x = 57 - y + z \\) and \\( 2y = 1 \\)\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nAssume \\( \\frac{1 - 2y}{7} = v \\), then \\( y = v - 3z \\) and \\( z = 1 - 2v \\)\n\ntherefore \\( v \\) may be taken any whole number at pleasure, and \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be determined by the following equations\n\n\\[ x = 1 - 2v \\]\n\\[ y = v - 3z = 7v - 3 \\]\n\\[ x = 57 - y + z = 61 - 9v \\]\n\nFrom the value of \\( x \\), it appears that \\( v \\) cannot exceed 6, and from the value of \\( y \\), that it cannot be less than 1.\n\nHence if \\( v = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\),\n\nwe have \\( x = 52, 43, 34, 25, 16, 7 \\)\n\\( y = 4, 11, 18, 25, 32, 39 \\).\n\n315. In the foregoing examples the unknown quantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) have each a determinate number of positive values, and this will evidently be the case as often as the proposed equation is of this form \\( ax + by = c \\). If, however, \\( b \\) be negative, that is, if the equation be of this form \\( ax - by = c \\), or \\( ax = by + c \\), we shall have questions of a different kind, admitting each of an infinite number of solutions, these, however, are to be resolved in the same manner as the preceding, as will appear from the following example.\n\nEx. 4. A person buys some horses and oxen, he pays 31 crowns for each horse, and 20 crowns for each ox, and he finds that the oxen cost him seven crowns more than the horses. How many did he buy of each?\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of horses, and \\( y \\) that of the oxen, then by the question\n\n\\[ 20x = 31y + 7, \\text{ and } x = \\frac{31y + 7}{20} = y + \\frac{11y + 7}{20}. \\]\n\nTherefore \\( \\frac{11y + 7}{20} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{11y + 7}{20} = v \\), then \\( x = y + v \\) and \\( y = \\frac{20v - 7}{11} = v + \\frac{9v - 7}{11} \\); hence \\( \\frac{9v - 7}{11} \\) must be a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{9v - 7}{11} = t \\), then \\( y = v + t \\) and \\( v = \\frac{11t + 7}{9} + \\frac{2t + 7}{9} \\); therefore \\( \\frac{2t + 7}{9} \\) is a whole number.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{2t + 7}{9} = s \\), then \\( v = s + r \\) and \\( t = \\frac{9s - 7}{2} = 4s + \\frac{s - 7}{2} \\); therefore \\( \\frac{s - 7}{2} \\) is a whole number.\n\nPut \\( \\frac{s - 7}{2} = r \\), then \\( t = 4s + r \\) and \\( s = 2r + 7 \\).\n\nHaving now no longer any fractions, we return to the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) by the following series of equations\nThe least positive values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) will evidently be obtained by making \\( r = -3 \\), and innumerable other values will be had by putting \\( r = -2, r = -1, r = 0, r = +1, \\) &c. Thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 5, 36, 67, 98, 129, 160, 191, 222, \\text{&c.} \\\\\ny &= 3, 23, 43, 63, 83, 103, 123, 143, \\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\neach series forming an arithmetical progression, the common difference in the first being 31 and in the second 20.\n\n316. If we consider the manner in which the numbers \\( x, y \\), in this example, are determined, from the succeeding quantities \\( v, t, \\) &c., we shall immediately perceive that the coefficients of those quantities are the same as the successive quotients which arise in the arithmetical operation for finding the greatest common measure of 20 and 31, the coefficients of the given equation \\( 20x = 31y + 7 \\). The operation performed at length will stand thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n20 & 31 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n11 & 20 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n9 & 11 & (1) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n2 & 9 & (4) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n1 & 2 & (2) \\\\\n- & - & - \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHence we may form a series of numeral equations which, when compared with the series of literal equations expressing the relations between \\( x, y, v, \\) &c., as put down in the following table, will render the method of determining the latter from the former sufficiently obvious\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n31 &= 1 \\times 20 + 11 \\\\\n20 &= 1 \\times 11 + 9 \\\\\n11 &= 1 \\times 9 + 2 \\\\\n9 &= 4 \\times 2 + 1 \\\\\n2 &= 2 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd as every question of this kind may be analyzed in the same manner, we may hence form the following general rule for resolving indeterminate problems of the first order.\n\n317. Let \\( bx = ay + n \\) be the proposed equation in which \\( a, b, n \\) are given integers, and \\( x, y \\) numbers to be found. Let \\( a \\) be the greatest of the two numbers \\( a, b \\), and let \\( A \\) denote the greatest multiple of \\( b \\) which is contained in \\( a \\), and \\( c \\); the remainder also let \\( B \\) denote the greatest multiple of \\( c \\) contained in \\( b \\), and \\( d \\) the remainder; and \\( C \\) the greatest multiple of \\( d \\) contained in \\( c \\), and \\( e \\) the remainder; and so on, till one of the remainders be found equal to \\( c \\). The numbers \\( A, B, C \\) afford a series of equations from which another series may be derived as in the following table.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\na &= Ab + c \\\\\nb &= Bc + d \\\\\nc &= Cd + e \\\\\nd &= De + f \\\\\ne &= Ef + g \\\\\nf &= Fg + o \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand in the last equation of the second series any number whatever may be put for \\( q \\), it is also to be observed that the given number \\( n \\) is to have the sign \\( + \\) prefixed to it, if the number of equations be odd, but \\( - \\) if that number be even. Having formed the second series of equations, the values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) may be thence found as in the foregoing examples. We proceed to show the application of the rule.\n\nEx. 5. Required a number which being divided by 11 leaves the remainder 3, but being divided by 19 leaves the remainder 5.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the number, and \\( x, y \\) the quotients which arise from the respective divisions, then we have \\( N = 11x + 3 \\), also \\( N = 19y + 5 \\), hence \\( 11x + 3 = 19y + 5 \\) and \\( 11x = 19y + 2 \\), an equation which furnishes the following table.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n19 &= 1 \\times 11 + 8 \\\\\n11 &= 1 \\times 8 + 3 \\\\\n8 &= 2 \\times 3 + 2 \\\\\n3 &= 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\\\\n2 &= 2 \\times 1 + 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( r \\) may be assumed of any value whatever,\n\nHence we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns &= 2r + 2 \\\\\nt &= s + r = 3r + 2 \\\\\nv &= 2t + s = 8r + 6 \\\\\ny &= v + t = 11r + 8 \\\\\nx &= y + v = 19r + 14 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand the number required \\( N = 209u + 157 \\) where it is evident that the least number which can express \\( N \\) is 157.\n\nEx. 6. \\[ \\begin{cases} 3x + 5y + 7z = 560 \\\\ 9x + 25y + 49z = 2920 \\end{cases} \\] To determine \\( x, y, z \\)\n\nGiven \\[ \\begin{cases} 9x + 25y + 49z = 2920 \\end{cases} \\] in whole numbers.\n\nFrom 7 times the first equation subtract the second; thus we have \\( 12x + 10y = 1000 \\), or \\( 6x + 5y = 500 \\) and from this last equation by proceeding as in the foregoing examples we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 500 - 5v \\\\\ny &= 6v - 500\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLet these values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be substituted in either of the original equations; in the first, for example, as being the most simple, and we find \\( 7x + 15z = 1560 \\).\n\nThis last equation being resolved in the same manner we find\nand hence it appears that the only values which \\( t \\) can have so as to give whole positive numbers for \\( x, y, z \\) are 209 and 210, thus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= 15 \\\\\ny &= 82 \\\\\nz &= 15 \\\\\n\\text{or} \\quad x &= 50 \\\\\ny &= 40 \\\\\nz &= 30.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n318. If an equation was proposed involving three unknown quantities, as \\( ax + by + cz = d \\), by transposition we have \\( ax + by - d = cz \\) and, putting \\( d - cz = e' \\), \\( ax + by = e' \\). From this last equation we may find values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) of this form\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= mr + nc', \\\\\ny &= m'r + n'c,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nor \\( x = mr + n(d - cz) \\), \\( y = m'r + n(d - cz) \\)\n\nwhere \\( z \\) and \\( r \\) may be taken at pleasure, except in so far as the values of \\( x, y, z \\) may be required to be all positive, for from such restriction the values of \\( z \\) and \\( r \\) may be confined within certain limits to be determined from the given equation.\n\n319. We proceed to indeterminate problems of the second degree. These produce equations of the three following forms,\n\nI. \\( y = \\frac{a}{b + cx} \\), II. \\( y = \\frac{a + bx}{c + dx} \\), III. \\( y = \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\).\n\nIn all these equations \\( a, b, c \\) denote given numbers; in the two first \\( x \\) is to be determined so that \\( y \\) may be an integer, and in the third \\( x \\) is to be determined so that \\( y \\) may be a rational quantity.\n\n320. In the equation \\( y = \\frac{a}{b + cx} \\) it is evident \\( b + cx \\) must be a divisor of \\( a \\), let \\( d \\) be one of its divisors, then \\( b + cx = d \\), and \\( x = \\frac{d - b}{c} \\), hence, to find \\( x \\) we must search among the divisors of \\( a \\) for one such that if \\( b \\) be subtracted from it the remainder may be divisible by \\( c \\), and the quotient will be such a value of \\( x \\) as is required.\n\n321. When \\( y = \\frac{a + bx}{c + dx} \\), if \\( d \\) be a divisor of \\( b \\), \\( x \\) will be taken out of the numerator if we divide it by \\( c + dx \\) and this form is then reduced to the preceding. But if \\( d \\) is not a divisor of \\( b \\), multiply both sides by \\( d \\), then \\( dy = da + dbx \\) or \\( dy = b + ad - bc \\), and so \\( x \\) is found by making \\( c + dx \\) equal to a divisor of \\( ad - bc \\).\n\nExample: Given \\( x + y + 2xy = 195 \\) to determine \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) in whole numbers.\n\nFrom the given equation \\( y = \\frac{195 - x}{1 + 2x} \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n2y = \\frac{391 - 2x}{1 + 2x} = -1 + \\frac{391}{1 + 2x}.\n\\]\n\nNow \\( 391 = 17 \\times 23 \\)\n\nhence we must assume \\( 1 + 2x = 17 \\), or \\( 1 + 2x = 23 \\), the first supposition gives us \\( x = 8, y = 11 \\); and the second \\( x = 11, y = 8 \\), the same result in effect as the former.\n\n322. It remains to consider the formula \\( y = \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\) where \\( x \\) is to be found so that \\( y \\) may be a rational quantity, but as the condition of having \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) also integers would add greatly to the difficulty of the problem and produce researches of a very intricate nature, we must be satisfied for the most part with fractional values. The possibility of rendering the proposed formula a square depends altogether upon the coefficients \\( a, b, c \\) and there are four cases of the problem, the solution of each of which is connected with some peculiarity in their nature.\n\n323. Case 1. Let \\( a \\) be a square number, then, putting \\( g^2 \\) for \\( a \\), we have \\( y = \\sqrt{g^2 + bx + cx^2} \\). Suppose \\( g^2 + bx + cx^2 = g + mx \\) then \\( g^2 + bx + cx^2 = g^2 + 2gmx + m^2x^2 \\), or \\( bx + cx^2 = 2gmx + m^2x^2 \\), that is \\( b + cx = 2gm + m^2x \\), hence\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2gm - b}{c - m^2}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{g^2 + bx + cx^2} = \\frac{cg - bm + gm^2}{c - m^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( m \\) may be any rational quantity either whole or fractional.\n\n324. Case 2. Let \\( c \\) be a square number \\( = g^2 \\), then putting \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + gx^2} = m + gx \\), we find \\( a + bx + gx^2 = m^2 + 2mgx + g^2x^2 \\), or \\( a + bx = m^2 + 2mgx \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{m^2 - a}{b - 2mg}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{a + bx + gx^2} = \\frac{bm - gm^2 - ag}{b - 2mg}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nHere \\( m \\), as before, may be taken at pleasure.\n\n325. Case 3. When neither \\( a \\) nor \\( c \\) are square numbers, yet, if the expression \\( a + bx + cx^2 \\) can be resolved into two simple factors as \\( f + gx \\) and \\( h + kx \\) the irrationality may be taken away as follows.\n\nAssume \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} = \\sqrt{(f + gx)(b + kx)} = m \\)\n\n\\( (f + gx) \\), then \\( (f + gx)(b + kx) = m^2 + (f + gx)^2 \\), or \\( b + kx = m^2(f + gx) \\), hence we find\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{fm^2 - b}{k - gm^2}, \\\\\ny &= \\sqrt{(f + gx)(b + kx)} = \\frac{(fk - gh)m}{k - gm^2}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand in these formulæ \\( m \\) may be taken at pleasure.\n\n326. Case 4. The expression \\( a + bx + cx^2 \\) may be transformed into a square as often as it can be resolved into two parts, one of which is a complete square, and the other a product of two simple factors; for then it has this form \\( p^2 + qr \\), where \\( p, q, r \\) are quantities which contain no power of \\( x \\) higher than the first. Let us assume \\( \\sqrt{p^2 + qr} = p + mq \\); thus we have \\( p^2 + qr = p^2 + 2mpq + m^2q^2 \\) and \\( r = 2mp + m^2q \\), and as this equation involves only the first power of \\( x \\) we may by proper reduction obtain from it rational values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as in the three foregoing cases.\n\n327. If we can by trials discover any one value of \\( x \\) which renders the expression \\( \\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2} \\) rational we may immediately reduce the quantity under the radical sign to the above-mentioned form, and thence find a general expression from which as many more values of \\( x \\) may be determined as we please. Thus let us suppose that \\( p \\) is a value of \\( x \\) which satisfies the con-\nIndeterminate Pro-\nblems.\n\nTherefore, by subtraction,\n\n\\[ y^2 - q^2 = b(x - p) + c(x^2 - p^2) = (b + cp + cx)(x - p) \\]\n\nand \\( y = \\sqrt{q^2 + (b + cp + cx)(x - p)} \\). The quantity under the radical sign being now reduced to the preferable form, it may be rendered rational by the substitution pointed out in last article.\n\n328. The application of the preceding general methods of resolution to any particular case is very easy; we shall therefore conclude with a very few examples.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to find two square numbers whose sum is a given square number.\n\nLet \\( a^2 \\) be the given square number, and \\( x^2, y^2 \\), the numbers required. Then by the question \\( x^2 + y^2 = a^2 \\), and \\( y = \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\). This equation is evidently of such a form as to be resolvable by the method employed in case 1. Accordingly by comparing \\( \\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\) with the general expression \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + bx + cx^2} \\) we have \\( g = a, b = 0, c = -1 \\), and substituting these values in the formulae of § 323, also \\( n \\) for \\( m \\), we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{2an}{n^2 + 1}, \\quad y = \\frac{a(n^2 - 1)}{n^2 + 1} \\]\n\nhence the numbers required are\n\n\\[ x^2 = \\frac{4a^2n^2}{(n^2 + 1)^2}, \\quad y^2 = \\frac{a^2(n^2 - 1)^2}{(n^2 + 1)^2} \\]\n\nIf \\( a = n^2 + 1 \\), where \\( n \\) is any number whatever, the square numbers \\( x^2 \\) and \\( y^2 \\) will both be integers, viz. \\( x^2 = 4n^2 \\) and \\( y^2 = (n^2 - 1)^2 \\). Let us suppose \\( n = 2 \\), then \\( a = n^2 + 1 = 5 \\), and \\( a^2 = 25 \\), hence \\( x^2 = 4n^2 = 16 \\), \\( y^2 = (n^2 - 1)^2 = 9 \\). Thus it appears that the square number 25 may be resolved into two other square numbers 9 and 16.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to find two square numbers whose difference shall be equal to a given square number \\( b^2 \\).\n\nThis question may be resolved in the same manner as the last. Or, without referring to any former investigation, let \\( (x + n)^2 \\) and \\( x^2 \\) be the numbers sought, then \\( (x + n)^2 - x^2 = b^2 \\), that is \\( 2nx + n^2 = b^2 \\), hence\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{b^2 - n^2}{2n} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + n = \\frac{b^2 + n^2}{2n} \\]\n\nSo that the numbers sought are\n\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{b^2 + n^2}{2n} \\right)^2, \\quad \\left( \\frac{b^2 - n^2}{2n} \\right)^2 \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) may be any number whatever. If for example \\( b^2 = 25 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), then \\( x = 12 \\) and \\( x + n = 13 \\); so that the numbers required are 144 and 169.\n\nEx. 3. It is required to determine \\( x \\), so that \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} \\) may be a rational square.\n\nLet \\( y \\) be the side of the square required, then \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} = y^2 \\) and \\( 4x^2 + 4x = 8y^2 \\). Let the first part of this equation be completed into a square by adding 1 to each side, then \\( 4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 1 + 8y^2 \\), and taking the root \\( 2x + 1 = \\sqrt{1 + 8y^2} \\), so that we have to make \\( 1 + 8y^2 \\) a square. Assume\n\n\\[ 1 + 8y^2 = \\left( 1 + \\frac{2p}{q} \\right)^2 = 1 + \\frac{2p}{q}y + \\frac{p^2}{q^2}y^2 \\]\n\nthen \\( 8y = \\frac{2p}{q}y + \\frac{p^2}{q^2}y^2 \\). Hence by proper reduction \\( y = \\frac{2pq}{8q^2 - p^2} \\) and\n\nsince \\( 2x + 1 = \\sqrt{1 + 8y^2} = \\frac{8q^2 + p^2}{8q^2 - p^2} \\), therefore \\( x = \\frac{8q^2 - p^2}{8q^2 + p^2} \\)\n\nand \\( \\frac{x^2 + x}{2} = \\frac{4p^2q^2}{(8q^2 + p^2)^2} \\), a rational square as was required.\n\nSect. XXXIII. Of the Resolution of Geometrical Problems.\n\n329. When a geometrical problem is to be resolved by algebra, the figure which is to be the subject of investigation must be drawn, so as to exhibit as well the known quantities, connected with the problem, as the unknown quantities, which are to be found. The conditions of the problem are next to be attentively considered, and such lines drawn, or produced, as may be judged necessary to its solution. This done, the known quantities are to be denoted by symbols in the usual manner, and also such unknown quantities as can most easily be determined; which may be either those directly required, or others from which they can be readily found. We must next proceed to deduce from the known geometrical properties of the figure a series of equations, expressing the relations between the known and unknown quantities; these equations must be independent of each other and as many in number as there are unknown quantities. Having obtained a suitable number of equations, the unknown quantities are to be determined in the same manner as in the resolution of numerical problems.\n\n330. No general rule can be given for drawing the lines, and selecting the quantities most proper to be represented by symbols, so as to bring out the simplest conclusion; because different problems require different methods of solution. The best way to gain experience in this matter is to try the solution of the same problem in different ways, and then apply that which succeeds best to other cases of the same kind, when they afterwards occur. The following particular directions however may be of some use.\n\n1. In preparing the figure by drawing lines, let them be either parallel or perpendicular to other lines in the figure, or so as to form similar triangles. And if an angle be given, it will be proper to let the perpendicular be opposite to that angle, and to fall from one end of a given line, if possible.\n\n2. In selecting the quantities for which symbols are to be substituted, those are to be chosen, whether required or not, which lie nearest the known or given parts of the figure, and by means of which the next adjacent parts may be expressed by addition and subtraction only, without the intervention of roots.\n\n3. When two lines, or quantities, are alike related to other parts of the figure, or problem, the best way is to substitute for neither of them separately but to substitute for their sum, or difference, or rectangle, or the sum of their alternate quotients, or some line or lines in the figure, to which they have both the same relation.\n4. When the area, or the perimeter of a figure is given, or such like parts of it as have only a remote relation to the parts required: it is sometimes of use to assume another figure similar to the proposed one, having one side equal to unity, or some other known quantity. For from hence the other parts of the figure may be found by the known proportions of like sides or parts, and so an equation will be obtained.\n\n331. We shall now give the algebraical solutions of some geometrical problems.\n\n**Prob. 1.** In a right angled triangle, having given the base, and the sum of the hypothenuse and perpendicular, to find both these two sides.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (Plate XIV. fig. 1.) represent the proposed triangle, right angled at \\(B\\). Let \\(AB\\), the given base, be denoted by \\(b\\), and \\(AC + BC\\) the sum of the hypothenuse and perpendicular by \\(s\\); then if \\(x\\) be put for \\(BC\\) the perpendicular, the hypothenuse \\(AC\\) will be \\(s - x\\). But from the nature of a right angled triangle \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\), that is\n\n\\[b^2 + x^2 = (s - x)^2 = s^2 - 2sx + x^2.\\]\n\nHence \\(b^2 = s^2 - 2sx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = BC\\). Also\n\n\\[s - x = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = AC.\\] Thus the perpendicular and hypothenuse are expressed by means of the known quantities \\(b\\) and \\(s\\) as required.\n\nIf a solution in numbers be required, we may suppose \\(AB = b = 3\\) and \\(AC + CB = s = 9\\), then\n\n\\[BC = \\frac{s^2 - b^2}{2s} = 4,\\] and \\(AC = \\frac{s^2 + b^2}{2s} = 5.\\)\n\n**Prob. 2.** In a right angled triangle, having given the hypothenuse, also the sum of the base and perpendicular, it is required to determine both these two sides.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 1.) represent the proposed triangle, right angled at \\(B\\). Put \\(a = AC\\) the given hypothenuse, and \\(s = AB + BC\\) the given sum of the sides, then if \\(x\\) be put for \\(AB\\), the base, \\(s - x\\) will denote \\(BC\\) the perpendicular.\n\nNow from the nature of right angled triangles \\(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\\), therefore \\(x^2 + (s - x)^2 = a^2\\), or \\(x^2 + s^2 - 2sx + x^2 = a^2\\), hence we have this quadratic equation \\(x^2 - sx = \\frac{a^2 - s^2}{2}\\), which being resolved, by completing the square, we find \\(x = \\frac{s \\pm \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2} = AB\\), and \\(s - x = \\frac{s \\mp \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2} = BC\\). Thus it appears that either of the two quantities \\(\\frac{s + \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2}, \\frac{s - \\sqrt{2a^2 - s^2}}{2}\\) may be taken for \\(AB\\), but whichever of the two be taken, the remaining one is necessarily equal to \\(BC\\).\n\n**Prob. 3.** It is required to inscribe a square in a given triangle.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 2.) be the given triangle, and \\(EFGH\\) the inscribed square. Draw the perpendicular \\(AD\\) cutting \\(EF\\) the side of the square in \\(K\\), then, because the triangle is given, the perpendicular \\(AD\\) may be considered as given. Let \\(BC = b\\), \\(AD = p\\), and considering \\(AK\\) as the unknown quantity, (because from it the square may be readily determined), let \\(AK = v\\); then \\(KD = EF = p - x\\).\n\nThe triangles \\(ABC, AEF\\) are similar; therefore \\(AD : BC :: AK : EF\\); that is \\(p : b :: x : p - x\\). Hence by taking the product of the extremes and means, \\(px = bx\\), and \\(x = \\frac{p^2}{p + b} = AK\\). If the side of the square be required, it may be immediately found by subtracting \\(AK\\) from \\(AD\\) the perpendicular. Thus we have \\(p - \\frac{p^2}{p + b} = KD = EF\\). Hence it appears that we may either take \\(AK\\) a third proportional to \\(AD + BC\\) and \\(AD\\), or take \\(DK\\) a fourth proportional to \\(AD + BC, AD\\) and \\(BC\\), and the point \\(K\\) being found, the manner of constructing the square is sufficiently obvious.\n\n**Prob. 4.** Having given the area of a rectangle inscribed in a given triangle, it is required to determine the sides of the rectangle.\n\nLet \\(ABC\\) (fig. 3.) be the given triangle, and \\(EDGF\\) the rectangle whose sides are required. Draw the perpendicular \\(CI\\) cutting \\(DG\\) in \\(H\\). Put \\(AB = b\\), \\(CI = p\\), \\(DG = EF = x\\), \\(DE = HI = y\\), then \\(CH = p - y\\). Let \\(a^2\\) denote the given area.\n\nThe triangles \\(CDG, CAB\\) are similar, hence\n\n\\[CH : DG :: CI : AB, \\text{ or } p - y : x :: p : b.\\]\n\nSo that to determine \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we have these two equations\n\n\\[xy = a^2, \\quad lp - ly = px.\\]\n\nFrom the first equation we find \\(y = \\frac{a^2}{x}\\), and from the second \\(y = \\frac{bp - px}{b}\\), therefore \\(\\frac{bp - px}{b} = \\frac{a^2}{x}\\) hence \\(x^2 - bx = \\frac{a^2 b}{p}\\), and from this quadratic equation, by completing the square, &c. we find\n\n\\[x = \\frac{b}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b^2}{4} - \\frac{a^2 b}{p}}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = \\frac{a^2}{x} = \\frac{p}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{p^2}{4} - \\frac{pa^2}{b}}.\\]\n\nHence it appears that if \\(\\frac{a^2 b}{p}\\) be less than \\(\\frac{b^2}{4}\\), that is if \\(a^2\\) be less than \\(\\frac{pb}{4}\\), there are two different rectangles, having the same area, which may be inscribed in the given triangle. It also appears that to render the problem possible, the given space \\(a^2\\) must not be greater than \\(\\frac{pb}{4}\\), that is, than half the area of the given triangle.\n\n**Prob. 5.** In a triangle, there are given, the base, the vertical angle, and the sum of the sides about that angle to determine each of these sides.\n\nLet us suppose that \\(ABC\\) (fig. 4.) is the triangle, of which there is given the base \\(AC\\), the vertical angle \\(ABC\\).\nABC and the sum of the sides AB, BC. Put AC = a,\nAB + BC = b, cosine of ∠ABC = c, and let AB, BC,\nthe sides required, be denoted by x and y.\n\nLet CD be drawn from either of the angles at the base\nperpendicular to the opposite side AB, then, rad.: cof.\nB :: CB : BD; therefore BD = cof. B × CB = cy.\n\nNow, from the principles of geometry, AC² = AB²\n+ BC² - 2AB × BD. Hence, and from the question,\nwe have these two equations\n\n\\[ x + y = b, \\quad x^2 - 2cxy + y^2 = a^2. \\]\n\nFrom the square of the first of these equations, viz.\n\\[ x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = b^2, \\] let the second be subtracted, thus we\nhave \\( 2(1+c)xy = b^2 - a^2, \\) and \\( xy = \\frac{b^2 - a^2}{1+c}. \\)\n\nAgain,\nfrom the square of the first equation let the double of\nthis last equation, viz. \\( 4xy = 2(b^2 - a^2), \\) be subtracted,\nand the result is \\( x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = \\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}, \\) so that\nby taking the square root of this last equation we ob-\ntain\n\n\\[ x - y = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}. \\]\n\nThus we have found the difference between the sides;\nnow their sum is given = b, hence, by adding \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the dif-\nference to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the sum we find\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{b}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}; \\]\n\nand subtracting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the difference from \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) the sum\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{b}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2 - (1+c)b^2}{1+c}}. \\]\n\nIf the angle at B be a right angle this problem be-\ncomes the same as prob. 2.\n\n332. By a method of investigation, in all respects si-\nmilar to that which has been employed in these ex-\namples, any proposed geometrical problem may be re-\nduced to an algebraic equation, the roots of which will\nexhibit arithmetical values of that geometrical magni-\ntude which constitutes the unknown quantity in the\nequation. But the roots of algebraic equations may\nalso be expressed by geometrical magnitudes, and hence\na geometrical construction of a problem may be derived\nfrom its algebraic solution. For example, quadratic\nequations, which all belong to one or other of these\nthree forms,\n\n\\[ x^2 + ax = bc, \\quad x^2 - ax = bc, \\quad x^2 - ax = -bc \\]\n\nor \\( x(x + a) = bc, \\quad x(x - a) = bc, \\quad x(a - x) = bc \\)\n\nmay be constructed as follows.\n\n333. Construction of the first and second forms. Let\na circle EABD (fig. 5.) be described with a radius\n= la, in which, from any point A in the circumference\napply a chord \\( AB = b - c \\) (b being supposed greater\nthan c) and produce AB so that BC = c; then AC = a.\n\nLet H be the centre of the circle, join CH cutting\nthe circumference in D and E, then, in the first case, the\npositive value of x shall be represented by CD, and in\nthe second by CE. For, by construction DE = a, there-\nfore, if CD be called \\( x \\), then CE = \\( x + a \\), but if CE\n= \\( x \\), then CD = \\( x - a \\). Now by the elements of geo-\nmetry EC × CD = AC × CB, that is \\( x(x + a) = bc \\) or\n\\( x^2 + ax = bc \\), which equation comprehends the first and\nsecond cases.\n\nIf the negative roots be required, that of the first\ncase will be CE and that of the second CD.\n\nWhen b and c are equal the construction will be ra-\nther more simple, for then AB vanishing, AC will coin-\ncide with the tangent CF. Therefore if a right an-\ngled triangle HFC be constructed whose legs HF and\nFC are equal respectively to \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) and \\( b \\), then will CD,\nthe value of \\( x \\) in the first case be equal to CH - HF\nand CE, the value of \\( x \\) in the latter, = CH + HF.\n\n334. Construction of the third form.—Let a circle\nEADB (fig. 6.) be described with a radius = \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) as\nbefore, in which apply a chord \\( AB = b + c \\), and take\nAC = b. Through C draw the diameter DCE, then\neither DC or EC will be positive roots of the equation.\nFor since ED = a, if either EC or CD = \\( x \\), the remain-\ning part of the diameter shall be \\( a - x \\), now by the\nnature of the circle EC × CD = AC × CB, that is \\( x \\)\n\\((a - x) = bc \\) or \\( x^2 - ax = -bc \\), hence it is evident that\nthe roots are rightly determined.\n\nIf b and c are equal the construction will be the\nsame, only it will then not be necessary to describe\nthe whole circle; for since AC will be perpendicular\nto the diameter, if a right angled triangle HCA be\nconstructed, having its hypotenuse HA = \\( \\frac{1}{2}a \\) and base\nAC = b, the roots of the equation will be expressed by\nAH + HC and AH - HC.\n\n335. If b and c be so unequal, that \\( b - c \\) in the first\ntwo cases, or \\( b + c \\) in the third, is greater than \\( a \\), then,\ninstead of these quantities, \\( \\frac{1}{2}b \\) and \\( 2c \\), or in general\n\\( \\frac{b}{n} \\) and \\( nc \\) (where \\( n \\) is any number whatever) may be\nused. Or a mean proportional may be found between\nb and c, and the construction performed as directed in\neach case when b and c are equal.\n\n336. It appears from § 333 and 334, that every\ngeometrical problem which produces a quadratic equa-\ntion may be constructed by means of a straight line\nand a circle, or is a plane problem, hence on the con-\ntrary, if a problem can be constructed by straight lines\nand circles, its algebraic resolution will not produce\nan equation higher than a quadratic. Cubic and bi-\nquadratic equations may be constructed geometrically\nby means of any two conic sections, hence it follows\nthat every geometrical problem which requires for its\nconstruction two conic sections, will, when resolved by\nalgebra, produce a cubic or biquadratic equation.\n\nSect. XXIV. Of the Loci of Equations.\n\n337. When an equation contains two indeterminate\nquantities \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), then for each particular value of \\( x \\)\nthere may be as many values of \\( y \\) as it has dimensions\nin that equation. So that if in an indefinite line\nAE (fig. 7.) there be taken a part AP to represent \\( x \\),\nand a perpendicular PM be drawn to represent \\( y \\),\nthere will be as many points M, M', &c., the extre-\nmities of these perpendiculars, as there are dimensions\nof \\( y \\) in the proposed equation. And the values of PM,\nPM', &c. will be the roots of the equation which are\nfound by substituting for \\( x \\) its value in any particular\ncase.\nHence it appears that in any particular equation we may determine as many points M, as we please, and a line which passes through all these points is called the locus of the equation. The line AP which expresses any value of x is called an abscissa; and PM which expresses the corresponding value of y is called an ordinate. Any two corresponding values of x and y are also called co-ordinates.\n\n338. When the equation that arises by substituting for x any particular value AP has all its roots positive, the points M, M', &c. will lie all on one side of AE, but if any of them be negative, these must be set off on the other side of AE towards m.\n\nIf x be supposed to become negative, then the line AP which represents it is to be taken in a direction opposite to that which represents the positive values of x; the points M, m, are to be taken as before, and the locus is only complete when it passes through all the points M, m, so as to exhibit a value of y corresponding to every possible value of x.\n\nIf in any case one of the values of y vanish, then the point M coincides with P, and the locus meets AE in that point. If one of the values of y become infinite, then it shows that the curve has an infinite arc, and in that case the line PM becomes an asymptote to the curve, or touches it at an infinite distance, if AP itself is finite.\n\nIf when x is supposed infinitely great, a value of y vanishes, then the curve approaches to AE as an asymptote.\n\nIf any values of y become impossible, then so many points M' vanish.\n\n339. From these observations and the theory of equations, it appears that when an equation is proposed involving two indeterminate quantities x and y, there may be as many intersections of the curve that is the locus of the equation and of the line PM, as there are dimensions of y in the equation; and as many intersections of the curve and the line AE as there are dimensions of x in the equation.\n\n340. A curve line is called geometrical or algebraic, when the equation which expresses the relation between x and y, any abscissa and its corresponding ordinate, consists of a finite number of terms, and contains besides these quantities only known quantities. Algebraic curves are divided into orders according to the dimensions of the equations which express the relations between their abscissas and ordinates, or according to the number of points in which they can intersect a straight line.\n\n341. Straight lines themselves constitute the first order of lines; and when the equation expressing the relation between x and y is only of one dimension, the points M must be all found in a straight line which contains with AE a given angle. Suppose for example that the given equation is ay = bx - cd = c, and that its locus is required.\n\nSince \\( y = \\frac{bx + cd}{a} \\), it follows that \\( APM \\) (fig. 8.), being a right angle, if AN be drawn making the angle NAP such that its cosine is to its sine as a to b, and drawing AD parallel to the ordinates PM, and equal to \\( \\frac{cd}{a} \\), if DF be drawn parallel to AN, then will DF\nTo illustrate these observations we shall take a few examples.\n\nEx. 1. It is required to describe the line that is the locus of this equation \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\) or \\( y^2 - ax - ab = 0 \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) denote given quantities. Since \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\), if \\( AP = x \\) (fig. 10.) be assumed of a known value and \\( PM, Pm \\) set off on each side equal to \\( \\sqrt{ax + ab} \\) the points \\( M, m \\) will belong to the locus required; and for every positive value of \\( AP \\) there may thus be found a point of the locus on each side. The greater \\( AP \\), or \\( x \\), is taken, the greater does \\( \\sqrt{ax + ab} \\) become, and consequently \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) the greater, and if \\( AP \\) be supposed infinitely great, \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) will also become infinitely great, therefore the locus has two infinite arcs that go off to an infinite distance from \\( AE \\) and from \\( AD \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed to vanish, then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab} \\), so that \\( y \\) does not vanish in that case, but passes through \\( D \\) and \\( d \\), taking \\( AD \\) and \\( Ad \\) each \\( = \\sqrt{ab} \\).\n\nIf \\( P \\) be supposed to move to the other side of \\( A \\), then \\( x \\) becomes negative, and \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab - ax} \\), so that \\( y \\) will have two values as before, while \\( x \\) is less than \\( b \\); but if \\( AB = b \\), and the point \\( P \\) be supposed to come to \\( B \\), then \\( ab = ax \\), and \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{ab - ax} = 0 \\); that is, \\( PM \\) and \\( Pm \\) vanish, and the curve there meets the line \\( AE \\). If \\( P \\) be supposed to move from \\( A \\) beyond \\( B \\), then \\( x \\) becomes greater than \\( b \\), and \\( ax \\) greater than \\( ab \\), so that \\( ab - ax \\) being negative, \\( \\sqrt{ab - ax} \\) becomes imaginary; that is, beyond \\( B \\) there are no ordinates which meet the curve, and consequently on that side the curve is limited in \\( B \\).\n\nAll this agrees very well with what is known by other methods, that the curve whose equation is \\( y^2 = ax + ab \\) is a parabola whose vertex is \\( B \\), axis \\( BE \\), and parameter equal to \\( a \\). For since \\( b + x = BP \\) and \\( y = PM \\), from the equation \\( ab = ax + y^2 \\), or \\( a(b + x) = y^2 \\), we have \\( a \\times BP = PM^2 \\), which is the well-known property of the parabola.\n\nEx. 2. It is required to describe the line that is the locus of the equation \\( xy + ay + cy = bc + bx \\),\n\nor \\( y = \\frac{bc + bx}{a + c + x} \\).\n\nHere it is evident (fig. 11.) that the ordinate \\( PM \\) can meet the curve in one point only, there being but one value of \\( y \\) corresponding to each value of \\( x \\). When \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( y = \\frac{bc}{a + c} \\) so that the curve does not pass through \\( A \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed to increase, then \\( y \\) will increase, but will never become equal to \\( b \\), since \\( y = \\frac{c + x}{a + c + x} \\) and \\( a + c + x \\) is always greater than \\( c + x \\).\n\nIf \\( x \\) be supposed infinite, then the terms \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) vanish compared with \\( x \\), and consequently \\( y = \\frac{b}{x} = b \\) from which it appears, that taking \\( AD = b \\), and drawing \\( GD \\) parallel to \\( AE \\), it will be an asymptote, and touch the curve at an infinite distance. If \\( x \\) be now supposed negative, and \\( AP \\) be taken on the other side of \\( A \\),\n\nthen \\( y = \\frac{c - x}{a + c - x} \\) and if \\( x \\) be taken on that side,\n\n\\( = c \\), then \\( y = \\frac{c - c}{a} = 0 \\), so that the curve must pass through \\( B \\) if \\( AB = c \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed greater than \\( c \\), then will \\( c - x \\) become negative, and the ordinate will become negative, and lie on the other side of \\( AE \\), till \\( x \\) become equal to \\( a + c \\), and then \\( y = \\frac{-a}{x} \\), that is, because the denominator is \\( 0 \\), \\( x \\) becomes infinite, so that if \\( A \\) be taken \\( = a + c \\), the ordinate \\( KD \\) will be an asymptote to the curve.\n\nIt \\( x \\) be taken greater than \\( a + c \\) or \\( AP \\) greater than \\( AK \\), then both \\( c - x \\) and \\( a + c - x \\) become negative, and consequently \\( y = \\frac{x - c}{a - c} \\) becomes a positive quantity; and since \\( x - c \\) is always greater than \\( a - c \\), it follows that \\( y \\) will be always greater than \\( b \\) or \\( KG \\), and consequently the rest of the curve lies in the angle \\( FGH \\). And as \\( x \\) increases, since the ratio of \\( x - c \\) to \\( x - a - c \\) approaches still nearer to a ratio of equality, it follows that \\( PM \\) approaches to an equality with \\( PN \\), therefore the curve approaches to its asymptote \\( GH \\) on that side also.\n\nThis curve is the common hyperbola, for since \\( b(c + x) = y(a + c + x) \\), by adding \\( ab \\) to both sides, \\( b(a + c + x) = y(a + c + x) + ab \\), and \\( (b - y)(a + c + x) = ab \\), that is \\( NM \\times GN = GC \\times BC \\) which is the property of the common hyperbola.\n\nEx. 3. It is required to describe the locus of the equation \\( ay^2 - xy^2 = x^3 + bx^2 \\).\n\nHere \\( y^2 = \\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x} \\), and therefore \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} \\),\n\nhence \\( PM \\) and \\( PM \\) (fig. 12.) are to be taken on each side, and equal to \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} \\); this expression by supposing \\( x = a \\) becomes infinite because its denominator is then \\( = 0 \\), therefore if \\( AB \\) be taken \\( = a \\) and \\( BK \\) be drawn perpendicular to \\( AB \\), the line \\( PK \\) shall be an asymptote to the curve. If \\( x \\) be supposed greater than \\( a \\), or \\( AP \\) greater than \\( AB \\), then \\( a - x \\) being negative, the fraction \\( \\frac{x^3 + bx^2}{a - x} \\) will become negative, and its square root impossible; so that no part of the locus can lie beyond \\( B \\). If \\( x \\) be supposed negative, or \\( P \\) taken on the other side of \\( A \\), then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-x^3 + bx^2}{c + x}} \\), hence the values of \\( y \\) will be real and equal as long as \\( x \\) is less than \\( b \\), but if \\( x = b \\), then \\( y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-x^3 + bx^2}{a - x}} = 0 \\), and consequently if \\( AD \\) be taken \\( = b \\); the curve will pass through \\( D \\), and there touch the\nthe ordinate. If \\( x \\) be taken greater than \\( b \\), then\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-x^2 - ax}{c + x}\n\\]\n\nbecomes imaginary, so that no part of the curve is found beyond \\( D \\). The portion between \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) is called a nodus. If \\( y \\) be supposed \\( = 0 \\), then will \\( x^3 + bx^2 = 0 \\) be an equation whose roots are \\( -b, 0, 0 \\), from which it appears that the curve passes twice through \\( A \\), and has in \\( A \\) a punctum duplex. This locus is a line of the 3rd order.\n\nIf \\( b \\) is supposed to vanish in the proposed equation, so that \\( ay^3 - xy^2 = x^3 \\), then will \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) coincide (fig. 13.) and the nodus vanish, and the curve will have in the point \\( A \\) a cuspis, the two arcs \\( AM \\) and \\( AM \\), in this case, touching one another in that point. This is the same curve which the ancients called the Clifford of Diocles.\n\nIf instead of supposing \\( b \\) positive, or equal to \\( 0 \\), we suppose it negative, the equation will be \\( ay^3 - xy^2 = x^3 - bx^2 \\), the curve will in this case pass through \\( D \\) as before, (fig. 14.) and taking \\( AB = a \\), \\( BK \\) will be its asymptote. It will have a punctum conjugatum in \\( A \\), because when \\( y \\) vanishes two values of \\( x \\) vanish, and the third becomes \\( -b \\) or \\( AD \\). The whole curve, besides this point, lies between \\( DQ \\) and \\( BK \\). These remarks are demonstrated after the same manner as in the first case.\n\n347. If an equation have this form\n\n\\[\ny = ax^n + bx^{n-1} + cx^{n-2} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nand \\( n \\) is an even number, then will the locus of the equation have two infinite arcs lying on the same side of \\( AE \\), (fig. 15.) for if \\( x \\) become infinite, whether positive or negative, \\( x^n \\) will be positive and \\( ax^n \\) have the same sign in either case, and as \\( ax^n \\) becomes infinitely greater than the other terms \\( bx^{n-1}, \\ldots \\), it follows that the infinite values of \\( y \\) will have the same sign in these cases, and consequently the two infinite arcs of the curve will lie on the same side of \\( AE \\).\n\nBut if \\( n \\) be an odd number, then when \\( x \\) is negative \\( x^n \\) will be negative, and \\( ax^n \\) will have the contrary sign to what it had when \\( x \\) is positive, and therefore the two infinite arcs will in this case lie on different sides of \\( AE \\), as in fig. 16. and tend towards parts directly opposite.\n\n348. If an equation have this form \\( yx^n = a^n + 1 \\), and \\( n \\) be an odd number, then when \\( x \\) is positive \\( y = \\frac{a^n + 1}{x^n} \\), but when \\( x \\) is negative \\( y = -\\frac{a^n + 1}{x^n} \\), so that this curve must all lie in the vertically opposite angles \\( KAE, FAE \\), (fig. 17.) as the common hyperbola, \\( FK, EE \\), being asymptotes.\n\nBut if \\( n \\) be an even number then \\( y \\) is always positive whether \\( x \\) be positive or negative, because \\( x^n \\) in this case is always positive, and therefore the curve must all lie in the two adjacent angles \\( KAE \\) and \\( KAE \\) (fig. 18.) and have \\( AK \\) and \\( AE \\) for its asymptotes.\n\n349. If an equation be such as can be reduced into two other equations of lower dimensions, without affecting \\( y \\) or \\( x \\) with any radical sign, then the locus shall consist of the two loci of those inferior equations. Thus the locus of the equation \\( y^2 - 2xy + ly + x^3 - bx = 0 \\),\n\nwhich may be resolved into these two, \\( y - y = 0, y - x \\) Arithmetic \\( + b = 0 \\), is found to be two straight lines cutting the absciss \\( AE \\) (fig. 19.) in angles of \\( 45^\\circ \\) in the points \\( A, B \\), whose distance \\( AB = b \\). In like manner some cubic equations can be resolved into three simple equations, and then the locus is three straight lines, or may be resolved into a quadratic and simple equation, and then the locus is a straight line and a conic section.\n\nIn general, curves of the superior orders include all the curves of the inferior orders, and what is demonstrated generally of any one order is also true of the inferior orders. Thus, for example, any general property of the conic sections holds true of two straight lines as well as a conic section, particularly that the rectangles of the segments of parallels bounded by them will always be to one another in a given ratio.\n\n350. From the analogy which subsists between algebraic equations and geometrical curves it is easy to see that the properties of the former must suggest corresponding properties of the latter. Hence the principles of algebra admit of the most extensive application to the theory of curve lines. It may be demonstrated, for example, that the locus of every equation of the second order is a conic section; and, on the contrary, the various properties of the diameters, ordinates, tangents, &c. of the conic sections may be readily deduced from the theory of equations.\n\nSect. XXV. Of the Arithmetic of Sines.\n\n351. The relations which subsist between the sines and cosines of any arches of a circle, and those of their sums, or differences, &c. constitute what is called the arithmetic of sines. This branch of calculation has its origin in the application of algebra to geometry, and is of great importance in the more difficult parts of the mathematics, as well as in their application to physics.\n\n352. In treating this subject it is necessary to attend to the following observations.\n\n1. If the sines of all arches between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 180^\\circ \\) be supposed positive, the sines of arches between \\( 180^\\circ \\) and \\( 360^\\circ \\) must be considered as negative; again, the sines of arches between \\( 360^\\circ \\) and \\( 540^\\circ \\) will be positive, and those of arches between \\( 540^\\circ \\) and \\( 720^\\circ \\) negative, and so on.\n\n2. If the cosines of arches between \\( 0^\\circ \\) and \\( 90^\\circ \\) be supposed positive, the cosines of arches between \\( 90^\\circ \\) and \\( 270^\\circ \\) must be considered as negative, and the cosines of arches between \\( 270^\\circ \\) and \\( 450^\\circ \\) positive, and so on.\n\n3. When an arch changes from \\( + \\) to \\( - \\), or from \\( - \\) to \\( + \\) its sine undergoes a like change, but its cosine is the same as before.\n\nThe truth of these observations must be evident from this consideration, that when a line, taken in a certain direction, decreases till it become \\( = 0 \\), and afterwards increases, but in a contrary direction; then, if in the former state it was considered as positive, it must be negative in the latter, and contrariwise.\n\n353. The following proposition may be considered as the foundation of the arithmetic of sines.\n\nLet \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) denote any two arches of a circle.\n\nThen, if radius be supposed \\( = 1 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\text{fin. } (a + b) = \\text{fin. } a \\times \\text{col. } b + \\text{col. } a \\times \\text{fin. } b.\n\\]\nLet C be the centre of the circle, (fig. 20.) and AB, BD the arches denoted by \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); then AD = \\(a + b\\); draw the radii CA, CB, CD, and the fines BE, BF, DG; then BE, BF, DG are the fines of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(a + b\\), respectively; and CE, CF, CG their cofines. Join EF, and draw FH parallel to DG. Because the angles CEB, CFB are right angles, the points C, E, B, F are in the circumference of a circle, hence, the angle FCB is equal to FEB; that is, to the alternate angle EFH; now CFB, EHF are both right angles, therefore the triangles CFB, EHF are similar, hence CF : CB = (CD) : FE : FE; but CF : CD :: FH : DG; therefore FH : FE :: FH : DG, hence FE = DG = fin. \\((a + b)\\). Because EBFC is a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, from the elements of geometry, we have BC × EF = BE × CF + BF × CE but BE = fin. \\(a\\), CF = cof. \\(b\\), BF = fin. \\(b\\), CE = cof. \\(a\\), BC = 1, and EF = DG = fin. \\((a + b)\\), therefore fin. \\((a + b)\\) = fin. \\(a\\) × cof. \\(b\\) + cof. \\(a\\) × fin. \\(b\\), as was to be proved.\n\n354. If in the preceding theorem we suppose the arch \\(b\\) to become negative, then fin. \\(b\\) will also become negative. Thus we obtain a second theorem, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sin.} (a - b) = \\text{fin.} a \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{cof.} a \\times \\text{fin.} b.\n\\]\n\nBecause cof. \\((a + b)\\) = fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) - b\\), and by the second theorem fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) - b\\) = fin. \\((90^\\circ - a) \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{cof.} (90^\\circ - a) \\times \\text{fin.} b = \\text{cof.} a \\times \\text{cof.} b - \\text{fin.} a \\times \\text{fin.} b\\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. IX. } 2 \\text{Cof.} a \\times \\text{fin.} na = \\text{fin.} (n + 1) a + \\text{fin.} (n - 1) a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. X. } 2 \\text{Sin.} a \\times \\text{cof.} na = \\text{fin.} (n + 1) a - \\text{fin.} (n - 1) a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XI. } 2 \\text{Cof.} a \\times \\text{cof.} na = \\text{cof.} (n + 1) a + \\text{cof.} (n - 1) a\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XII. } 2 \\text{Sin.} a \\times \\text{fin.} na = -\\text{cof.} (n + 1) a + \\text{cof.} (n - 1) a.\n\\]\n\n356. By means of the four last theorems, the powers and products of the fines and cofines of arches may be expressed in terms of the sums and differences of certain multiples of those arches.\n\nThus, if in theor. XII. we suppose \\(n = 1\\), it becomes\n\n\\[\n2 \\text{Sin.}^2 a = -\\text{cof.} 2 a + 1.\n\\]\n\nTo find the third power of fin. \\(a\\), let both sides of this equation be multiplied by 2 fin. \\(a\\), then 4 fin. \\(a = 2 \\times \\text{fin.} a (-\\text{cof.} 2 a + 1)\\), but 2 fin. \\(a \\times \\text{cof.} 2 a = \\text{fin.} 3 a - \\text{fin.} a\\), theor. X. Therefore\n\n\\[\n4 \\text{Sin.}^3 a = -\\text{fin.} 3 a + 3 \\text{fin.} a.\n\\]\n\nAgain, for the fourth power, let both sides of the last equation be multiplied by 2 fin. \\(a\\), then 8 fin. \\(a = 2 \\times \\text{fin.} a (-\\text{fin.} 3 a + 3 \\text{fin.} a)\\); but 2 fin. \\(a \\times \\text{fin.} 3 a = -\\text{cof.} 4 a + \\text{cof.} 2 a\\), and 2 fin. \\(a \\times \\text{fin.} a = -\\text{cof.} 2 a + 1\\), theor. XII. therefore by substitution\n\n\\[\n8 \\text{Sin.}^4 a = \\text{cof.} 4 a - 4 \\text{cof.} 2 a + 3.\n\\]\n\nProceeding in this way the successive powers of fin. \\(a\\) may be calculated as in the following table:\n\n| Sin. \\(a\\) | fin. \\(a\\) |\n|-----------|------------|\n| 2 Sin. \\(a\\) | -cof. 2 \\(a\\) + 1 |\n| 4 Sin. \\(a\\) | -fin. 3 \\(a\\) + 3 fin. \\(a\\) |\n| 8 Sin. \\(a\\) | cof. 4 \\(a\\) - 4 cof. 2 \\(a\\) + 3 |\n| 16 Sin. \\(a\\) | fin. 5 \\(a\\) - 5 fin. 3 \\(a\\) + 10 fin. \\(a\\) |\n| 32 Sin. \\(a\\) | -cof. 6 \\(a\\) + 6 cof. 4 \\(a\\) - 15 cof. 2 \\(a\\) + 10 |\n| 64 Sin. \\(a\\) | -fin. 7 \\(a\\) + 7 fin. 5 \\(a\\) - 21 fin. 3 \\(a\\) + 35 fin. \\(a\\) |\n\n&c.\nThe successive powers of the cosines may be found in the same manner. Thus\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Cof. } a &= \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n2 \\text{Cof.}^2 a &= \\text{cof. } 2a + 1 \\\\\n4 \\text{Cof.}^3 a &= \\text{cof. } 3a + 3 \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n8 \\text{Cof.}^4 a &= \\text{cof. } 4a + 4 \\text{cof. } 2a + 3 \\\\\n16 \\text{Cof.}^5 a &= \\text{cof. } 5a + 5 \\text{cof. } 3a + 10 \\text{cof. } a \\\\\n32 \\text{Cof.}^6 a &= \\text{cof. } 6a + 6 \\text{cof. } 4a + 15 \\text{cof. } 2a + 10 \\\\\n64 \\text{Cof.}^7 a &= \\text{cof. } 7a + 7 \\text{cof. } 5a + 21 \\text{cof. } 3a + 35 \\text{cof. } a, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n357. As an example of the products of the sines and cosines of an arch, let it be proposed to express \\( \\sin^3 a \\times \\cos^2 a \\) by the sines, or cosines of multiples of \\( a \\). We have already found \\( 4 \\sin^3 a = -3 \\sin 3a + 3 \\sin a \\), therefore\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n16 \\sin^3 a \\times \\cos^2 a &= 2 \\cos^2 a \\times 2 \\cos a (-3 \\sin 3a + 3 \\sin a) \\\\\n&= 2 \\cos^2 a (-3 \\sin 4a + 2 \\sin 2a) \\\\\n&= -\\sin 5a + \\sin 3a + 2 \\sin a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThus it appears that all positive integer powers of the sine and cosine of an arch, or any product of those powers, may be expressed in finite terms by the sines and cosines of multiples of that arch.\n\n358. On the contrary, the sine and cosine of any arch may be expressed by the powers of the sine and cosine of an arch whereof it is a multiple. For it appears from the 9th and 11th theorems that\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin (n+1)a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin na - \\sin (n-1)a \\\\\n\\cos (n+1)a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\cos na - \\cos (n-1)a.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, by taking \\( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) successively we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin a &= \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 2a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 3a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 2a - \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin 4a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 3a - \\sin 2a \\\\\n\\sin 5a &= 2 \\cos a \\times \\sin 4a - \\sin 3a, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSo that, putting \\( s \\) for the sine, and \\( c \\) for the cosine of the arch \\( a \\), and remarking that \\( c^2 = 1 - s^2 \\),\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin a &= s \\\\\n\\sin 2a &= 2cs \\\\\n\\sin 3a &= 4c^3s - s = -4s^3 + 3s \\\\\n\\sin 4a &= 8c^4s - 4cs = c(-8s^3 + 4s) \\\\\n\\sin 5a &= 16c^5s - 12c^3s + s = 16s^3 - 20s^3 + 5s, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos a &= c \\\\\n\\cos 2a &= 2c^2 - 1 \\\\\n\\cos 3a &= 4c^3 - 3c \\\\\n\\cos 4a &= 8c^4 - 8c^2 + 1 \\\\\n\\cos 5a &= 16c^5 - 20c^3 + 5c, \\\\\n&\\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n359. If it be required to find the sine or cosine of an arch, from having given the sine or cosine of some multiple of that arch, it may be found by resolving an equation of an order denoted by the numerical coefficient of the multiple arch. Thus if the cosine of an arch be given, to determine the cosine of half the arch, let \\( C \\) denote the given cosine, and \\( x \\) that which is required, then the equation \\( \\cos 2x = 2x^2 - 1 \\) becomes \\( C = 2x^2 - 1 \\), which equation being resolved gives\n\n\\[\nx = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1+C}{2}}.\n\\]\n\nIf the sine be required, from that of twice the arch being given, it may be found from the equation \\( \\sin 2x = 2xt \\), which, by putting \\( S \\) for the given sine, and \\( y \\) for the sine required, becomes \\( S = 2y\\sqrt{1-y^2} \\), or, by squaring both sides, and reducing,\n\n\\[\ny^4 - y^2 = \\frac{S^2}{4}; \\quad \\text{whence} \\quad y^2 = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1-S^2}}{2}.\n\\]\n\nThe two values of \\( x \\) indicate that there are two arches, the one as much less than \\( 90^\\circ \\), as the other exceeds \\( 90^\\circ \\), such, that the cosine of the double of each is expressed by the same number. And the four values of \\( y \\) show that there are four arches, viz., two positive and two negative, such, that the sine of the double of each is expressed by the same number.\n\nSuppose now that the cosine of an arch is given to find the cosine of one-third of that arch, then, putting \\( C \\) to denote the given cosine, and \\( x \\) that which is required, the equation to be resolved is\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 3x = C, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x^3 - \\frac{3}{4}x - \\frac{C}{4} = 0.\n\\]\n\nBy comparing this cubic equation with the general equation \\( x^3 + qx + r = 0 \\), it appears that \\( q \\) is negative and such that \\( 4q^3 > 27r^2 \\), for \\( C \\) is always less than unity; hence it follows that the equation belongs to the irreducible case, or that which cannot be resolved by Cardan's rule. The equation \\( 4 \\sin^3 a - 3 \\sin a = -\\sin 3a \\) is also of the same form; in order, therefore, to find either the sine or cosine of one-third of a given arch recourse must be had to the methods of approximation explained in Sect. XVI.\n\n360. The sum of any powers of the sines, or cosines of arches which constitute the arithmetical progression \\( a, a+p, a+2p, a+3p, \\ldots \\) to \\( a+np \\) may be\nArithmetic be found as follows. We have already found, therefore, by substituting \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) successively for \\(p\\) we obtain the following series of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sin (a) &= \\sin a \\\\\n\\sin (a+d) &= \\sin (a-d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+2d) &= \\sin (a+2d) - \\sin (a-d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+3d) &= \\sin (a+3d) - \\sin (a+2d) + \\sin (a-d), \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n\\sin (a+nd) &= \\sin (a+(n-1)d) - \\sin (a+(n-2)d) \\\\\n\\sin (a+(n+1)d) &= \\sin (a+(n+1)d) - \\sin (a+nd) + \\sin (a-d)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, if we substitute\n\n\\[\nS = \\sin a + \\sin (a+d) + \\sin (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\sin (a+nd),\n\\]\n\nby taking the sum of all the equations, it is evident that\n\n\\[\nS + \\sin (a+(n+1)d) = \\sin a + 2 \\cos d \\times S - \\sin (a-d) - (\\sin (a+nd))\n\\]\n\nwhich equation, by proper reduction becomes\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{\\sin a - \\sin (a+(n+1)d) + \\sin (a+nd) - \\sin (a-d)}{2(1-\\cos d)}\n\\]\n\nBy proceeding in the same manner with theor. VII. viz.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cof. } (p+d) = 2 \\cos d \\times \\cos p - \\cos (p-d)\n\\]\n\nand substituting \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) successively for \\(p\\), also putting\n\n\\[\nC = \\cos a + \\cos (a+d) + \\cos (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\cos (a+nd)\n\\]\n\nwe obtain this other theorem\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{\\cos a - \\cos (a+(n+1)d) + \\cos (a+nd) - \\cos (a-d)}{2(1-\\cos d)}\n\\]\n\n361. It is worthy of remark, that if the arch \\(d\\) is contained \\(n+1\\) times, either in the whole circumference, or any number of circumferences, that is, if \\((n+1)d = q \\times 360^\\circ\\), where \\(q\\) is any whole number, then \\(nd = q \\times 360^\\circ - d\\). Thus we have \\(\\sin (a+(n+1)d) = \\sin (a+q \\times 360^\\circ) = \\sin a\\), also \\(\\sin (a+nd) = \\sin (a-d)\\), for the sine of any arch is equal to the sine of the same arch increased by any number of circumferences, and the same is true also of the cosine of an arch. Hence it appears that in these circumstances the terms in the numerators of the fractions, which are equal to \\(S\\) and \\(C\\), destroy one another, and thus \\(S\\) and \\(C\\) are both \\(=0\\); that is, the positive sines, and cosines are equal to the negative sines, and cosines, respectively. Now if the circumference of a circle be divided into \\(n+1\\) equal parts at the points \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c. (fig. 21.) and any diameter \\(BC\\) drawn, then, if the arch \\(BA = a\\), and the arch \\(AA' = d\\), the arches \\(BAA', BAA'A''\\), &c. will be equal to \\(a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) respectively; and, supposing the extremity of the diameter to fall between \\(A\\) and \\(A'''\\), the arch \\(BA\\), &c. \\(A'''\\) will be equal to \\(a+nd\\). Hence we derive the following remarkable property of the circle. Let the circumference of a circle be divided into any number of equal parts at the points \\(A, A', A'', A'''\\), &c.; and from the points of division let the fines \\(AD, AD', A'D', A''D'\\), &c. be drawn upon any diameter \\(BCE\\); then, the sum of \\(AD, A'D', \\ldots\\) the fines on one side of the diameter shall be equal to the sum of \\(A''D', A''D'', \\ldots\\) the fines on the other side of the diameter. Also, the sum of \\(CD, C'D', C''D', C''D''\\), the cosines on one side of the centre shall be equal to the sum of \\(C'D', C''D', \\ldots\\) the cosines on the other side of the centre.\n\n362. Let us next investigate the sum of the squares of the fines of the arches \\(a, a+d, a+2d, \\ldots\\) For this purpose we may form a series of equations from the theorem\n\n\\[\n2 \\sin^2 a = 1 - \\cos 2a\n\\]\n\nThus we have\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n2 \\sin^2 a &= 1 - \\cos 2a \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+d) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+d) \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+2d) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+2d) \\\\\n&\\vdots \\\\\n2 \\sin^2 (a+nd) &= 1 - \\cos 2(a+nd)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nLet $S' = \\sin^2 a + \\sin^2 (a+d) + \\sin^2 (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\sin^2 (a+nd)$\n\nThen, by addition, and observing that $\\cos 2a + \\cos 2(a+d) + \\ldots + \\cos 2(a+nd)$ is by § 360\n\n$$\\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\nwe have\n\n$$2S' = n - \\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\nIn the same manner by forming a series of equations from this theorem $2 \\cos^2 a = 1 + \\cos 2a$, and putting\n\n$$\\cos^2 a + \\cos^2 (a+d) + \\cos^2 (a+2d) + \\ldots + \\cos^2 (a+nd)$$\n\nwe find\n\n$$2C' = n + \\frac{\\cos 2a - \\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) + \\cos 2(a+nd) - \\cos 2(a-d)}{2(1-\\cos 2d)}$$\n\n363. If we now suppose $d$ to be such an arch that $(n+1)d = \\text{the whole circumference} = 360^\\circ$, then\n\n$$\\cos 2(a+(n+1)d) = \\cos 2(a+2\\times 360^\\circ) = \\cos 2a,$$\n\nalso\n\n$$\\cos 2(a+nd) = \\cos 2(a-d) + 2\\times 360^\\circ = \\cos 2(a-d).$$\n\nThus it appears that in this particular case the numerators of the fractional parts of the values of $2S'$ and $2C'$ are each $=0$, and hence $2S'$ and $2C'$ are each $=n$.\n\nWe must except, however, the case of $n=1$, for then $d=180^\\circ$, and $\\cos 2d=1$, so that the denominator of each fraction vanishing as well as the numerator, it would be wrong to conclude that the fractions themselves vanish.\n\nNow if the circumference of a circle be divided into $n+1$ equal parts at the points $A, A', A'', \\ldots$ (fig. 21.) and any diameter $BE$, as also the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., be drawn, then, if the arch $BA=a$, and the arch $AA'=d$, we have, as in § 361, $AD=\\sin a$, $A'D'=\\sin (a+d)$, $A''D''=\\sin (a+2d)$, &c., and, supposing the point $B$ to fall between $A$ and $A''$, $A''D''=\\sin (a+nd)$. Hence we derive the following very elegant and general theorem relating to the circle.\n\nLet the circumference of a circle be divided into $n$ equal parts (where $n$ is any number greater than 2) at the points $A, A', A'', \\ldots$; and from the points of division let the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., be drawn perpendicular to any diameter whatever. Twice the sum of the squares of the fines $AD, A'D', A''D''$, &c., is equal to $n$ times the square of the radius of the circle: Also twice the sum of the squares of the cosines $CD, C'D', C''D''$, &c., is equal to $n$ times the square of the radius of the circle.\n\n364. We might now proceed to find the sum of the cubes of the fines of the arches $a, a+d, a+2d$, &c., from the equation\n\n$$ch.(n+1)a = ch.\\sup.na - ch.\\sup.(n-1)a$$\n\n367. Let $x$ = chord of $a$, and $y$ = chord of its supplement, then, putting $0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ successively for $n$, and observing that $ch.o a=0$, we obtain from the first of these theorems the following series of equations\n\n$$ch.a=x$$\n$$ch.2a=xy$$\n$$ch.3a=x(y^2-1)$$\n$$ch.4a=x(y^3-2y)$$\n$$ch.5a=x(y^4-3y^2+1)$$\n$$ch.6a=x(y^5-4y^3+3y)$$\n$$ch.7a=x(y^6-5y^4+6y^2-1),$$\n&c.\n\nIf $4=x^2$, and the powers of that quantity be substituted for $y^2$, and its powers, in the chords of $3a, 5a$, &c.,\nArithmetic \\(7a\\), &c., also in the chords of the supplements of \\(2a\\), \\(4a\\), \\(6a\\), &c., we shall obtain the following series of equations expressing the relations between the chord of any arch, and the chords of the multiples of that arch, if those multiples be odd numbers, or the chords of their supplements, if they be even numbers\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{ch. } a &= 4x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 2a &= -x^3 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 3a &= -x^3 + 3x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 4a &= +x^3 - 4x^2 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 5a &= +x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x \\\\\n\\text{ch. sup. } 6a &= -x^3 + 6x^2 - 9x^3 + 2 \\\\\n\\text{ch. } 7a &= -x^3 + 7x^2 - 14x^3 + 7x, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThese equations are the foundation of the theory of angular sections, or method of dividing a given angle, or arch of a circle, into any proposed number of equal parts; a problem which evidently requires for its general algebraic solution the determination of the roots of an equation of a degree equal to the number of parts into which the arch is to be divided. By means of the same series of equations we may also find the side of any regular polygon inscribed in a circle, and in this case the multiple arch, being equal to the whole circumference, will have its chord \\(=0\\).\n\n368. The relation between the tangents of any two arches and that of their sum may be readily found by means of the 1st and 3d theorems of this section. For since \\(\\sin(a+b) = \\sin a \\times \\cos b + \\cos a \\times \\sin b\\) and \\(\\cos(a+b) = \\cos a \\times \\cos b - \\sin a \\times \\sin b\\), therefore, dividing the former equation by the latter\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin(a+b)}{\\cos(a+b)} = \\frac{\\sin a \\times \\cos b + \\cos a \\times \\sin b}{\\cos a \\times \\cos b - \\sin a \\times \\sin b}\n\\]\n\nBut the sine of any arch divided by its cosine is equal to the tangent of that arch, hence the last equation becomes\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XIII. tan.}(a+b) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b}{1 - \\tan a \\times \\tan b}\n\\]\n\nand by supposing the arch \\(b\\) negative, we also find\n\n\\[\n\\text{Theor. XIV. tan.}(a-b) = \\frac{\\tan a - \\tan b}{1 + \\tan a \\times \\tan b}\n\\]\n\n§65. From the first of these two theorems a series of equations may be derived expressing the relations which take place between the tangent of an arch and the tangent of any multiple of that arch. Thus by assuming \\(b = a, 2a, &c.\\) and putting \\(t\\) for \\(\\tan a\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan 2a &= \\frac{2t}{1-t^2} \\\\\n\\tan 3a &= \\frac{3t-3t^3}{1-3t^2}, \\\\\n&\\text{&c.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand hence the tangent of an arch being given, the tangent of any part of that arch, as its half, third, &c. may be found by the resolution of an equation.\n\nALGEDO, a suppressed gonorrhoea, a name which occurs in old authors.

By this city the Moors entered Spain in 713; and it was taken from them in 1344, after a very long siege, remarkable for being the first in which cannon were made use of.

On the top of one of these mountains was erected a temple of Diana, to which Horace refers, lib. i. od. 21. \"Quaecunque aut gelido prominet Algido,\" and lib. iii. od. 23. \"Quae nivei paefitur Algide, &c.\"\n\nALGIERS, a kingdom of Africa, now one of the states of Barbary.—According to the latest and best computations, it extends 460 miles in length from east to west; but is very unequal in breadth, some places being scarcely 40 miles broad, and others upward of 100. It lies between Loug. \\(0^\\circ 16'\\) and \\(9^\\circ 16'\\). W. and extends from Lat \\(36^\\circ 55'\\) to \\(44^\\circ 50'\\). N.—It is bounded on the north, by the Mediterranean; on the east, by the river Zaine, the ancient Tuca, which divides it from Tunis; on the west, by the Muluya, and the mountains of Trava, which separate it from Morocco; and on the south by the Sahara, Zaara, or Numidian desert.\n\nThe kingdom of Algiers is at present divided into Division of three provinces or districts, viz. the eastern, western, the king-\n\n4 Q 2\nThe eastern or Levantine government, which is by far the most considerable of the three, and is also called Beylick, contains the towns of Bona, Constantina, Gigeri, Bujeya, Steffia, Tebez, Zamoura, Biscara, and Nocaniz, in all which the Turks have their garrisons; besides which, it includes the two ancient kingdoms of Cucu and Labez, though independent of the Algerine government, to whose forces their country is inaccessible; so that they still live under their own cheyks chosen by each of their adowers or hords. To these we may add a French factory at Callo, under the direction of the company of the French Bastion.—The western government hath the towns of Oran, Tremecen, Moftagan, Tenez, and Secrery with its cattle and garrison.—The southern government hath neither town, village, nor even a houle, all the inhabitants living in tents, which obliges the dey and his forces to be always encamped.\n\nInhabitants. The inhabitants along the sea coasts are a mixture of different nations; but chiefly Moors and Morecos driven out of Catalonia, Arragon, and other parts of Spain. Here are also great numbers of Turks, who come from the Levant to seek their fortune; as well as multitudes of Jews and Christians taken at sea, who are brought thither to be sold for slaves. The Berebers are some of the most ancient inhabitants of the country; and are supposed to be descended from the ancient Sabaeans, who came hither from Arabia Felix under the conduct of one of their princes. Others believe them to be some of the Canaanites driven out of Palestine by Joshua. These are dispersed all over Barbary, and divided into a multitude of tribes under their respective chiefs; most of them inhabit the mountainous parts; some range from place to place, and live in tents, or portable huts; others in scattered villages; they have nevertheless, kept themselves for the most part from intermixing with other nations. The Berebers are reckoned the richest of all, go better clothed, and carry on a much larger traffic of cattle, hides, wax, honey, iron, and other commodities. They have also some artisans in iron, and some manufacturers in the weaving branch.—The name of Bereber is supposed to have been originally given them on account of their being first settled in some desert place. Upon their increasing in process of time, they divided themselves into five tribes, probably on account of religious differences, called the Zinbagians, Mysamedias, Zenetii, Hoares, and Gomeres; and these having produced 600 families, subdivided themselves into a great number of petty tribes.—To these we may add the Zuwawabs, by European authors called Azaguer, or Affaguer, who are likewise dispersed over most parts of Barbary and Numidia. Great numbers of these inhabit the mountainous parts of Cucu, Labez, &c., leading a wandering pastoral life. But the most numerous inhabitants are the Moors and Arabians. The former are very stout and warlike, and skilful horsemen; but so addicted to robbing, that one cannot safely travel along the country at a distance from the towns without a guard, or at least a marabout or saint for a safeguard. For as they look upon themselves to be the original proprietors of the country, and not only as disposed of by the rest of the inhabitants, but reduced by them to the lowest state of poverty, they make no scruple to plunder all they meet by way of reprisal. The inhabitants in general have a pretty fair complexion; they are robust and well proportioned. People of distinction wear their beard; they have rich clothes made of silk, embroidered with flowers of gold, and turbans enriched with jewels. The Turks, who compose the military force, have great privileges, pay no taxes, are never publicly punished, and rarely in private. The lowest soldier dominates over the most distinguished Moors at pleasure. If he finds them better mounted than himself, he exchanges horses without ceremony. The Turks alone have the privilege of carrying firearms. Many good qualities, however, distinguish them in spite of this excess of deportment. They never game for money, not even for trifles; and they never profane the name of the Deity. They soon forget their private quarrels; and after the first proxim of relentment is over, it is infamy for a Turk to keep in remembrance the injuries he has received. In this respect certainly they are less barbarous than other nations that boast of their civilization. See Moors.\n\nThe climate of Algiers is in most places so temperate, and there is a constant verdure; the leaves of the foil trees being neither parched up by heat in summer, nor nipped by the winter's cold. They begin to bud in February; in April the fruit appears in its full bigness, and is commonly ripe in May. The foil, however, is excessively various; some places being very hot, dry, and barren, on which account they are generally suffered to lie uncultivated by the inhabitants, who are very negligent. These barren places, especially such as lie on the southern side, and are at a great distance from the sea, harbour vast numbers of wild animals, as lions, tigers, buffaloes, wild boars, flags, porcupines, monkeys, ostriches, &c. On account of their barrenness, they have but few towns, and those thinly peopled; though some of them are advantageously situated for trading with Bildulgerid and Negroland, as to drive a considerable traffic with them.\n\nThe most considerable rivers of Algiers are: (1.) The Rivers, or Ziz, which runs across the province of Tremecen and the desert of Anguid, falling into the Mediterranean near the town of Tabecrita, where it has the name of Sirut. (2.) The Haregol, supposed the Sign of Ptolemy, comes down from the great Atlas, crosses the desert of Anguid, and falls into the sea about five leagues from Oran. (3.) The Mina, supposed the Chlematis of Ptolemy, a large river, which runs through the plains of Bathala, and falls into the sea near the town of Arzew. This river hath lately received the name of Cena, who rebuilt the town of Barthalam after it had been destroyed. (4.) The Shellif, Zilef or Zilif, descending from the Mount Gnaeexeris, runs through some great deserts, the lake Titteri, the frontiers of Tremecen, and Tenez, falling into the sea a little above the city of Moftagan. (5.) The Celef, supposed to be the Caribena of the ancients, falls into the sea about three leagues west of Algiers, after a short course of 18 or 20 leagues. (6.) The Huez-alguir, supposed to be the Nalabata or Na'aba of the ancients, and called by the Europeans Zinganir, runs down with a swift course through some high mountains of Cucu, and falls into the sea near Bujeyah. Whilst the city of Bujeyah was in the hands of the Harbours of Christians, the mouth of this river was so choked up by sand, that no vessel could come up into it: but in cleared by accident.\nvery soon after it was taken by the Moors, the great rains swelled it to such a degree, that all the sand and mud was carried off; so that galleys and other vessels have ever since entered it with ease, where they lie safe from storms, and all winds but that which blows from the north. (7.) Suf-Gemar, or Suf-Gimmar al-Rummiel, supposed to be the Amygdala of Ptolemy, hath its source in Mount Auras, on the confines of Atlas; thence runs through some barren plains, and the fruitful ones of Constantine, where its stream is greatly increased by some other rivers it receives; from thence running northward, along the ridges of some high mountains, it falls into the sea a little east of Gergi. (8.) The Ladeg, or Ludeg, runs down from Mount Atlas through part of Constantine, and falls into the sea a little eastward of Bona. (9.) Guadi, or Guadel Barbar, springs from the head of Orbus, or Urbs, in Tripoli, runs through Bujejah, and falls into the sea near Tabarea.\n\nThe Algerine kingdom made formerly a considerable part of the Mauritania Tingitana (see Mauritania), which was reduced to a Roman province by Julius Caesar, and from him also called Mauritania Cæsariensis.—In the general account of Africa, it has been noticed, that the Romans were driven out of that continent by the Vandals; these by Beliferius, the Greek emperor Justinian's general; and the Greeks in their turn by the Saracens. This last revolution happened about the middle of the seventh century; and the Arabs continued matters of the country, divided into a great number of petty kingdoms or states, under chiefs of their own choosing, till the year 1051.\n\nThis year, one Abubeker-ben-Omer, or, as the Spaniards authors call him, Abu-Texefien, an Arab of the Zinthagian tribe, being provoked at the tyranny of those despots, gathered, by the help of his marabouts or saints, a most powerful army of malcontents, in the southern provinces of Numidia and Libya. His followers were nicknamed Morabites or Morabites; by the Spaniards Almoravides; probably from their being assembled principally by the saints who were also called Morabites. The caliph of Kayem's forces were at this time taken up with quelling other revolts in Syria, Mecopotamia, &c. and the Arabs in Spain engaged in the most bloody wars; so that Texefien having nothing to fear from them, had all the success he could wish against the Arabian cheyks or petty tyrants, whom he defeated in many battles, and at last drove them not only out of Numidia and Libya, but out of all the western parts, reducing the whole province of Tingitania under his dominion.\n\nTexefien was succeeded by his son Yusef, or Joseph, a brave and warlike prince. In the beginning of his reign, he laid the foundation of the city of Morocco, which he designed to make the capital of his empire. While that city was building, he sent some of his marabouts ambassadors to Tremezen (now a province of Algiers), at that time inhabited by a powerful and insolent sect of Mahometans called Zeneti. The design of this embassy was to bring them back to what he called the true faith; but the Zeneti, despising his offers, assembled at Amaf, or Amas, their capital, murdered the ambassadors, and invaded Joseph's dominions with an army of 30,000 men.\n\nThe king hearing of their infamous proceedings, speedily mustered his army, and led it by long marches into their country, destroying all with fire and sword; while the Zeneti, instead of opposing his progress, retired as fast as possible towards Fez, in hopes of receiving assistance from thence. In this they were miserably deceived: the Fezzans marched out against them in a hostile manner; and coming up with the unhappy Zeneti, encumbered with their families and baggage, and ready to expire with hunger and weariness, they cut them all to pieces, except a small number who were mostly drowned in attempting to swim across a river, and some others who in their flight perished by falling from the high adjacent rocks. In the mean time Joseph reduced their country to a mere desert; which was, however, soon peopled by a numerous colony of Fezzans, who settled there under the protection of the reigning kings. In this war it is computed that near a million of the Zeneti, men, women, and children, lost their lives.\n\nThe restless and ambitious temper of Joseph did not let him remain long at peace. He quickly declared war against the Fezzans, reduced them to become his tributaries, and extended his conquests all along the Mediterranean. He next attacked some Arabian cheyks who had not yet submitted to his jurisdiction; and pursued them with such fury, that neither the Libyan deserts, nor ridges of the most craggy rocks, could shelter them from his arms. He attacked them in such of their retreats, castles, and fortresses, as were till then deemed impregnable; and at last subdued them, to the great grief of the other African nations, who were greatly annoyed by the ravages committed by his numerous forces.\n\nThus was founded the empire of the Morabites: which, however, was of no long duration; that race being in the 12th century driven out by Mohavedin, a marabout. This race of priests was expelled by Ab-Sharifs of dulac governor of Fez; and he, in the 13th century, Hacen, stripped of his new conquests by the sharifs of Hacen, who the descendants of those Arabian princes whom Abu-Texefien had formerly expelled.\n\nThe better to secure their new dominions, the sharifs divided them into several little kingdoms or provinces; and among the rest the present kingdom of Algiers was divided into four, namely, Tremezen, Tenez, Algiers Proper, and Bujejah. The four first monarchs laid to good a foundation for a lasting balance of power between their little kingdoms, that they continued for some centuries in mutual peace and amity; but at length the king of Tremezen having ventured to violate some of their articles, Abul-Farez, king of Tenez, declared war against him, and obliged him to become his tributary. This king dying soon after, and having divided his kingdom among his three sons, new discord arose; which Spain taking advantage of, a powerful fleet and army was sent against Barbary, under the count of Navarre, in 1505. This commandant soon made himself master of the important cities of Oran, Bujejah, and some others; which alarmed the Algerines, that they put themselves under the protection of Selim Eutemi, a noble and warlike Arabian prince. He came to their assistance with a great number of his bravest subjects, bringing with him his wife Zaphira, and a son then about 12 years old. This, however, was not sufficient to prevent the Spaniards...\nnards from landing a number of forces near Algiers that same year, and obliging that metropolis to become tributary to Spain. Nor could Prince Selim hinder them from building a strong fort on a small island opposite to the city, which terrified their corsairs from falling either in or out of the harbour.\n\nTo this galling yoke the Algerines were obliged to submit till the year 1516; when, hearing of the death of Ferdinand king of Spain, they sent an embassy to Aruch Barbarossa, who was at this time no less dreaded for his valour than his surprising success, and was then sent on a cruise with a squadron of galleys and barks. The purport of the embassy was, that he should come and free them from the Spanish yoke; for which they agreed to pay him a gratuity answerable to so great a service. Upon this Barbarossa immediately dispatched 18 galleys and 30 barks to the affluence of the Algerines: while he himself advanced towards the city with 800 Turks, 3000 Jigelites, and 2000 Moorish volunteers. Instead of taking the nearest road to Algiers, he directed his course towards Sharifbel, where Hafizan, another famed corsair, had settled himself. Him he surprised, and obliged to surrender; not without a previous promise of friendship: but no sooner had Barbarossa got him in his power, than he cut off his head; and obliged all Hafizan's Turks to follow him in his new expedition.\n\nOn Barbarossa's approach to Algiers, he was met by Prince Eutemi, attended by all the people of that metropolis, great and small; who looked for deliverance from this abandoned villain, whom they accounted invincible. He was conducted into the city amidst the acclamations of the people, and lodged in one of the noblest apartments of Prince Eutemi's palace, where he was treated with the greatest marks of distinction. Elated beyond measure with this kind reception, Barbarossa formed a design of becoming king of Algiers; and fearing some opposition from the inhabitants, on account of the excesses he suffered his soldiery to commit, murdered Prince Eutemi, and caused himself to be proclaimed king; his Turks and Moors crying out as he rode along the streets, \"Long live King Aruch Barbarossa, the invincible king of Algiers, the chosen of God to deliver the people from the oppression of the Christians; and destruction to all that shall oppose, or refuse to own him as their lawful sovereign.\" These last threatening words so intimidated the inhabitants, already apprehensive of a general massacre, that he was immediately acknowledged king. The unhappy princess Zaphira, it is said, poisoned herself, to avoid the brutality of this new king, whom she unsuccessfully endeavoured to stab with a dagger.\n\nBarbarossa was no sooner seated on the throne, than he treated his subjects with such cruelty, that they fled to shut up their houses and hide themselves when he appeared in public. In consequence of this, a plot was soon formed against him; but being discovered, he caused twenty of the principal conspirators to be beheaded, their bodies to be buried in a dunghill, and laid a heavy fine on those who survived. This so terrified the Algerines, that they never afterwards durst attempt anything against either Barbarossa or his successors.\n\nIn the mean time, the son of Prince Eutemi having fled to Oran, and put himself under the protection of Algiers, the marquis of Gomarez, laid before that nobleman a plan for putting the city of Algiers into the hands of the king of Spain. Upon this, young Selim Eutemi was sent to Spain, to lay his plan before Cardinal Ximenes; who having approved of it, sent a fleet with 10,000 land forces, under the command of Don Francisco, or, as others call him, Don Diego de Vera, to drive out the Turks, and restore the young prince. But the fleet was no sooner come within sight of land, than it was dispersed by a storm, and the greatest part of the ships dashed against the rocks. Most of the Spaniards were drowned; and the few who escaped to shore were either killed by the Turks or made slaves.\n\nThough Barbarossa had nothing to boast on this occasion, his pride and insolence were now fanned to such a degree, that he imagined himself invincible, and that the very elements conspired to make him so. The Arabians were so much alarmed at his success, that they implored the affluence of Hamidel Abdes king of Tenez, to drive the Turks out of Algiers. That prince readily undertook to do what was in his power for this purpose, provided they agreed to settle the kingdom on himself and his descendants. This proposal being accepted, he immediately set out at the head of 10,000 Moors; and, upon his entering the Algerine dominions, was joined by all the Arabians in the country. Barbarossa engaged him, only with 1000 Turkish musqueteers and 500 Granada Moors; totally defeated his numerous army; pursued him to the very gates of his capital, which he easily made himself master of; and having given it up to be plundered by the Turks, obliged the inhabitants to acknowledge him as their sovereign. This victory, however, was chiefly owing to the advantage which his troops had from their fire-arms; the enemy having no other weapons than arrows and javelins.\n\nNo sooner was Barbarossa become master of the kingdom of Tenez, than he received an embassy from the inhabitants of Tremecen; inviting him to come to their affluence against their then reigning prince, with whom they were dissatisfied on account of his having dethroned his nephew, and forced him to fly to Oran; offering him even the sovereignty, in case he accepted of their proposal. The king of Tremecen, not suspecting the treachery of his subjects, met the tyrant with an army of 6000 horse and 3000 foot: but Barbarossa's artillery gave him such an advantage, that the king was at length forced to retire into the capital; which he had no sooner entered, than his head was cut off, and sent to Barbarossa, with a fresh invitation to come and take possession of the kingdom. On his approach, he was met by with the inhabitants, whom he received with complaisance, and many fair promises; but beginning to tyrannize as usual, his new subjects soon convinced him that they were not so passive as the inhabitants of Algiers. Apprehending, therefore, that his reign might prove uneasy and precarious, he entered into an alliance with the king of Fez; after which, he took care to secure the rest of the cities in his new kingdom, by garrisoning them with his own troops. Some of these, however, revolted soon after; upon which he sent one of his corsairs, named Efeander, a man no less cruel than himself, to reduce them. The Tremecenians now began to re-\npent in good earnest of their having invited such a tyrant to their assistance; and held consultations on the most proper means of driving him away, and bringing back their lawful prince Abuchen Men; but their cabals being discovered, a great number of the conspirators were massacred in the most cruel manner. The prince had the good luck to escape to Oran, and was taken under the protection of the marquis of Gomarez, who sent immediate advice of it to Charles V., then lately arrived in Spain, with a powerful fleet and army. That monarch immediately ordered the young king a succour of 10,000 men, under the command of the governor of Oran; who, under the guidance of Abuchen Men, began his march towards Tremecen; and in their way they were joined by Prince Selim, with a great number of Arabs and Moors. The first thing they resolved upon was, to attack the important fortress of Calau, situated between Tremecen and Algiers, and commanded by the corsair Escander at the head of about 300 Turks. They invested it closely on all sides, in hopes Barbarossa would come out of Tremecen to its relief, which would give the Tremecenians an opportunity of keeping him out. That tyrant, however, kept close in his capital, being embarrassed by his fears of a revolt, and the politic delays of the king of Fez, who had not sent the auxiliaries he promised. The garrison of Calau, in the meantime, made a brave defence; and, in a sally they made at night, cut off near 300 Spaniards. This encouraged them to venture a second time; but they were now repulsed with great loss, and Escander himself wounded; soon after which, they surrendered upon honourable terms; but were all massacred by the Arabians, except 16, who clung close to the stirrups of the king, and of the Spanish general.\n\nBarbarossa being now informed that Abuchen Men, with his Arabs, accompanied by the Spaniards, were in full march to lay siege to Tremecen, thought proper to come out, at the head of 1500 Turks and 5000 Moorish horse, in order to break his way through the enemy; but he had not proceeded far from the city, before his council advised him to return and fortify himself in it. This advice was now too late; the inhabitants being resolved to keep him out, and open their gates to their own lawful prince as soon as he appeared. In this distress Barbarossa saw no way left but to retire to the citadel, and there defend himself till he could find an opportunity of stealing out with his men and all his treasure. Here he defended himself vigorously; but his provisions failing him, he took advantage of a subterraneous back way, which he had caused to be dug up for that purpose; and, taking his immense treasure with him, stole away as secretly as he could. His flight, however, was soon discovered; and he was so closely pursued, that to amuse, as he hoped, the enemy, he caused a great deal of his money, plate, jewels, &c. to be scattered all the way, thinking they would not fail to stop their pursuit to gather it up. This stratagem, however, failed, through the vigilance of the Spanish commander, who being himself at the head of the pursuers, obliged them to march on, till he was come up close to him on the banks of the Huezda, about eight leagues from Tremecen. Barbarossa had just crossed the river with his vanguard, when the Spaniards came up with his rear on the other side, and cut them all off; and then crossing the water, overtook him at a small distance from it. Here a bloody engagement ensued, in which the Turks fought like as many lions; defeated but, being at length overpowered by numbers, they and killed were all cut to pieces, and Barbarossa among the rest, by the Spaniards in the 44th year of his age, and four years after he had raised himself to the royal title of Yigel and the adjacent country; two years after he had acquired the sovereignty of Algiers, and scarce a twelvemonth after the reduction of Tremecen. His head was carried to Tremecen on the point of a spear; and Abuchen Men proclaimed king, to the joy of all the inhabitants. A few days after the fight, the king of Fez made his appearance at the head of 20,000 horse, near the field of battle; but hearing of Barbarossa's defeat and death, marched off with all possible speed, to avoid being attacked by the enemy.\n\nThe news of Barbarossa's death spread the utmost consternation among the Turks at Algiers; however, they cauled his brother Hayradin to be immediately proclaimed king. The Spanish commander now sent back the emperor's forces, without making any attempt upon Algiers; by which he lost the opportunity of driving the Turks out of that country; while Hayradin, justly dreading the consequences of the tyranny of his officers, fought the protection of the Grand Signior. This was readily granted, and himself appointed bashaw or viceroy of Algiers; by which means he received such considerable reinforcements, that the unhappy Algerines durst not make the least complaint; and such numbers of Turks resorted to him, that he was not only capable of keeping the Moors and Arabs in subjection at home, but of annoying the Christians at sea. His first step was to take the Spanish fort He takes above mentioned, which was a great nuisance to his men, the Spaniards. The Spaniards held out to the last extremity; but being all slain or wounded, Hayradin easily became master of the place.\n\nHayradin next set about building a strong mole for the safety of his ships. In this he employed 30,000 Christian slaves, whom he obliged to work without intermission for three years; in which time the work was completed. He then caused the fort he had taken from the Spaniards to be repaired, and placed a strong garrison in it, to prevent any foreign vessels from entering the harbour without giving an account of themselves. By these two important works, Hayradin soon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but also by the maritime Christian powers, especially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the Grand Signior with his success, and obtained from him a fresh supply of money, by which he was enabled to build a stronger fort, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of an enemy. All these have since received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occasion for them.\n\nIn the mean time the sultan, either out of a sense of the great services Hayradin had done, or perhaps out of jealousy lest he should make himself independent, raised Hayradin to the dignity of bashaw of the empire, and appointed Haffan Aga, a Sardinian renegade, an intrepid warrior, and an experienced officer, to succeed him as bashaw of Algiers. Haffan had no sooner taken possession of his new government, than he began to pursue his ravages on the Spanish coast with greater\ngreater fury than ever; extending them to the ecclesiastical state, and other parts of Italy. But Pope Paul III., being alarmed at this, exhorted the emperor Charles V. to send a powerful fleet to suppress those frequent and cruel piracies; and, that nothing might be wanted to render the enterprise successful, a bull was published by his holiness, wherein a plenary abolution of sins, and the crown of martyrdom, was promised to all those who either fell in battle or were made slaves; the emperor on his part needed no spur; and therefore let fall at the head of a powerful fleet consisting of 120 ships and 20 galleys, having on board 30,000 chosen troops, and an immense quantity of money, arms, ammunition, &c. In this expedition many young nobility and gentry attended as volunteers, and among these many knights of Malta, so remarkable for their valour against the enemies of Christianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles in his expedition, and the wives and daughters of the officers and soldiers followed them with a design to settle in Barbary after the conquest was finished. All these meeting with a favourable wind, soon appeared before Algiers; every ship displaying the Spanish colours on the stern, and another at the head, with a crucifix to serve them for a pilot.\n\nBy this prodigious armament, the Algerines were thrown into the utmost consternation. The city was surrounded only by a wall with scarce any outworks. The whole garrison consisted of 800 Turks and 6000 Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly disciplined and accoutred; the rest of their forces being dispersed in the other provinces of the kingdom, to levy the usual tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spaniards landed without opposition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the course of a spring which supplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmost distress, Hassan received a summons to surrender at discretion, on pain of being put to the sword with all the garrison. The herald was ordered to extol the vast power of the emperor both by sea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Christian religion. But to this Hassan only replied, that he must be a madman who would pretend to advise an enemy, and that the advised must still act more madly who would take counsel of such an adviser. He was, however, on the point of surrendering the city, when advice was brought him that the forces belonging to the western government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was resolved to defend it to the utmost. Charles, in the mean time, resolving upon a general assault, kept a constant firing upon the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garrison, he looked upon as already in his hands. But while the dourwan, or Algerine senate, were deliberating on the most proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad prophet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the assembly, and foretold the speedy destruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was soon accomplished in a very surprising and unexpected manner: for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful storm of wind, rain, and hail, arose from the north, accompanied with violent shocks of earthquakes, and a dismal and universal darkness both by sea and land; so that the sun, moon, and elements, seemed to combine together for the destruction of the Spaniards. In that one night, some say in less than half an hour, 86 ships and 15 galleys were destroyed, with all their crews and military stores; by which the army on shore was deprived of all means of subsisting in these parts. Their camp also, which spread itself along the plain under the fort, was laid quite under water by the torrents which descended from the neighbouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into some better situation, were cut in pieces by the Moors and Arabs; while several galleys and other vessels, endeavouring to gain some neighbouring creeks along the coasts, were immediately plundered, and their crews massacred, by the inhabitants.\n\nThe next morning Charles beheld the sea covered with the fragments of so many ships, and the bodies of Algiers men, horses, and other creatures, swimming on the rafts, waves; at which he was so disheartened, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army, though in no small disorder, towards Cape Malabux, in order to reembark in those few vessels which had weathered the storm. But Hassan, who had caused his motions to be watched, allowed him just time to get to the shore, when he fell out and attacked the Spaniards in the midst of their hurry and confusion to get into their ships, killing great numbers, and bringing away a still greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers, where he celebrated with great rejoicings his happy deliverance from such distresses and danger.\n\nSoon after this, the prophet Yufet, who had foretold the destruction of the Spaniards, was not only declared the deliverer of his country, but had a considerable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exercising his prophetic function unmolested. It was not long, however, before the marabouts, and some interpreters of the law, made a strong opposition against him; remonstrating to the bashaw, how ridiculous and scandalous it was to their nation, to ascribe the deliverance of it to a poor fortune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent saint of their own profession. But though the bashaw and his douwan seemed, out of policy, to give into this last notion, yet the impression which Yufet's predictions and their late accomplishments had made upon the minds of the common people, proved too strong to be eradicated; and the spirit of divination and conjuring has since got into such credit among them, that not only their great statesmen, but their priests, marabouts, and fanatics, have applied themselves to that study, and dignified it with the name of Mahomet's Revelations.\n\nThe unhappy Spaniards had scarcely reached their fresh calms, when they were attacked by a fresh storm, in which several more of them perished; one ship in particular, containing 700 soldiers, besides sailors, sunk in the emperor's sight, without a possibility of saving a single man. At length, with much labour, they reached the port of Buzyab, at that time possessed by the Spaniards, whither Hassan king of Tunis soon after repaired, with a supply of provisions for the emperor, who received him graciously, with fresh assurances of his favour and protection. Here he dismissed the few remains of the Maltese knights and their forces, who embarked in three shattered galleys, and with much difficulty\nAlgiers, ficulty and danger reached their own country. Charles himself stood no longer than till the 16th of November, when he set sail for Carthagena, and reached it on the 25th of the same month. In this unfortunate expedition upwards of 120 ships and galleys were lost, above 300 colonels and other land and sea officers, 8000 soldiers and marines, besides those destroyed by the enemy on the reembarkation, or drowned in the last storm.\n\nThe number of prisoners was so great, that the Algerines sold some of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.\n\nHassan, elated with this victory, in which he had very little share, undertook an expedition against the king of Tlemcen, who, being now deprived of the alliance of the Spaniards, was forced to procure a peace by paying a vast sum of money, and becoming tributary to him. The bashaw returned to Algiers, laden with riches; and soon after died of a fever, in the 66th year of his age.\n\nFrom this time the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines in any considerable degree. In 1555, they lost the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salha Rais, Hassan's successor; who next year set out on a new expedition, which he kept a secret, but was suspected to be intended against Oran; but he was scarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time raged violently in the city, broke out in his groin, and carried him off in 24 hours.\n\nImmediately after his death the Algerine soldiery chose a Corsican renegade, Hassan Corfo, in his room, till they should receive farther orders from the Porte. He did not accept of the bashawship without a good deal of difficulty; but immediately proceeded the intended expedition against Oran, despatching a messenger to acquaint the Porte with what had happened. They had hardly begun their hostilities against the place, when orders came from the Porte, expressly forbidding Hassan Corfo to begin the siege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to raise it immediately. This news was received with great grief by the whole fleet and army, as they thought themselves sure of success, the garrison being at that time very weak. Nevertheless, as they dared not disobey, the siege was immediately raised.\n\nCorfo had hardly enjoyed his dignity four months, before news came, that eight galleys were bringing a new bashaw to succeed him; one Tekelli, a principal Turk of the Grand Signor's court; upon which the Algerines unanimously resolved not to admit him. By the treachery of the Levantine soldiery, however, he was admitted at last, and the unfortunate Corfo thrown over a wall in which a number of iron hooks were fixed; one of which catching the ribs of his right side, he hung three days in the most exquisite torture before he expired.\n\nTekelli had no sooner entered upon his new government, than he behaved with such cruelty and rapacity, that he was assassinated even under the dome of a faint, by Yulef Calabres, the favourite renegade of Hassan Corfo; who for this service was unanimously chosen bashaw, but died of the plague six days after his election.\n\nYulef was succeeded by Hassan the son of Hayraddin, who had been formerly recalled from his bashawship, when he was succeeded by Salha Rais; and now had the good fortune to get himself reinstated in his employment. Immediately on his arrival, he engaged Algiers in a war with the Arabs, by whom he was defeated with great loss. The next year, the Spaniards under Hassan took an expedition against Moftagan, under the command of the count d'Alcandela; but were utterly defeated, the commander himself killed, and 12,000 men taken prisoners. This disaster was owing to the inconsiderate rashness, or rather madness, of the commander; which was so great, that, after finding it impossible to rally his scattered forces, he rushed, sword in hand, into the thickest of the enemy's ranks, at the head of a small number of men, crying out, \"St Jago! St Jago! the victory is ours, the enemy is defeated!\" soon after which he was thrown from his horse, and trampled to death.\n\nHassan having had the misfortune to disoblige his subjects by allowing the mountaineers of Cuco to buy ammunition at Algiers, was sent in irons to Constantinople, while the aga of the janizaries, and general of the land forces, supplied his place. Hassan easily found means to clear himself; but a new bashaw was appointed, called Achmet; who had no sooner arrived than he lent the two deputy-bashaws to Constantinople, where their heads were struck off.—Achmet was a man of such infatuated avarice, that, upon his arrival at Algiers, all ranks of people came in crowds to make him presents; which he the more greedily accepted, as he had bought his dignity by the money he had amassed while head gardener to the Sultan. He enjoyed it, however, only four months; and after his death, the state was governed other four months by his lieutenant; when Hassan was a third time sent viceroy to Algiers, where he was received with the greatest demonstrations of joy.\n\nThe first enterprise in which Hassan engaged, was the siege of the fort of Marsalquivir, situated near the city Oran, which he designed to invest immediately after. The army employed in this siege consisted of 26,000 foot and 10,000 horse, besides which he had a fleet consisting of 32 galleys and galliots, together with three French vessels laden with biscuit, oil, and other provisions. The city was defended by Don Martin de Cordova, brother of the count d'Alcandela, who had been taken prisoner in the battle where that nobleman was killed, but had obtained his liberty from the Algerines with immense sums, and now made a most gallant defense against the Turks. The city was attacked with the utmost fury by sea and land, so that several breaches were made in the walls. The Turkish standards were several times planted on the walls, and as often dislodged; but the place must have in the end submitted, had not Hassan been obliged to raise the siege in haste, on the news that the famed Genoese admiral Doria was approaching with considerable succours from Italy. The fleet accordingly arrived soon after; but missing the Algerine galleys, bore away for Pennon de Velez, where they were shamefully repulsed by a handful of Turks who garrisoned that place; which, however, was taken the following year.\n\nIn 1567, Hassan was again recalled to Constantinople, where he died three years after. He was succeeded by Mahomet, who gained the love of the Algerines by several public-spirited actions. He incorporated the janizaries and Levantine Turks together, and by that means put an end to their dissensions, which\nlaid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the Porte. He likewise added some considerable fortifications to the city and castle, which he designed to render impregnable. But while he was thus studying the interest of Algiers, one John Galcon, a bold Spanish adventurer, formed a design of surprising the whole piratical navy in the bay, and setting them on fire in the night-time, when they lay defenseless, and in their first sleep. For this he had not only the permission of King Philip II., but was furnished by him with proper vessels, mariners, and fireworks, for the execution of his plot. With these he fell foul for Algiers in the most proper season, viz. the beginning of October, when most, if not all the ships lay at anchor there; and easily sailed near enough, unsuspected, to view their manner of riding, in order to catch them unawares, at a time when the greater part of their crews were dispersed in their quarters. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole-gate, and dispersed his men with their fire-works; but to their great surprize, they found them so ill mixed, that they could not with all their art make them take fire. In the mean time, Galcon took it into his head, by way of bravado, to go to the mole-gate, and give three loud knocks at it with the pommel of his dagger, and to leave it fixed in the gate by its point, that the Algerines might have cause to remember him. This he had the good fortune to do without meeting with any disturbance or opposition: but it was not so with his men; for no sooner did they find their endeavours unsuccessful, than they made such a battle as quickly alarmed the guard posted on the adjacent bastion, from which the uproar quickly spread itself through the whole garrison. Galcon now finding himself in the utmost danger, fell away with all possible haste; but he was pursued, overtaken, and brought back a prisoner to Mahomet; who no sooner got him into his power, than he immediately caused a gibbet of considerable height to be erected on the spot where Galcon had landed, ordering him to be hoisted up, and hung by the feet to a hook, that he might die in exquisite torture; and to show his resentment and contempt of the king his master, he ordered his commission to be tied to his toes. He had not, however, hung long in that state, when the captain who took him, accompanied by a number of other corsairs, interceded so strongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of some Christian surgeons; but two days after, some Moors reporting that it was the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines durst not hurt a hair of Galcon's head, &c., the unfortunate Spaniard was hoisted up by a pulley to the top of the execution-wall, and let down again upon the hook, which in his fall caught him by the belly, and gave him such a wound, that he expired without a groan.\n\nThus ended the expedition of John Galcon, which has procured him a place among the Spanish martyrs; while, on the other hand, the Algerines look upon his disappointment to have been miraculous, and owing to the efficacious protection of the powerful saint Sidi Oulededdha, whose prayers had before raised such a terrible storm against the Spanish fleet.\n\nMahomet, being soon after recalled, was succeeded by the famous renegade Ochali, who reduced the kingdom of Tunis; which, however, remained subject to the viceroy of Algiers only till the year 1586, when a bailiwick of Tunis was appointed by the Porte.\n\nThe kingdom of Algiers continued to be governed, till the beginning of the seventeenth century, by viceroys or bailiwicks appointed by the Porte; concerning whom we find nothing very remarkable, further than that their avarice and tyranny were intolerable both to the Algerines and the Turks themselves. At last the Turkish janizaries and militia becoming powerful enough to suppress the tyrannic sway of these bailiwicks, and the people being almost exhausted by the heavy taxes laid upon them, the former resolved to depose these petty tyrants, and set up some officers of their own at the head of the realm. The better to succeed in this attempt, the militia sent a deputation of some of their chief members to the Porte, to complain of the avarice and oppression of these bailiwicks, who funk both the revenue of the state, and the money remitted to it from Constantinople, into their own coffers, which should have been employed in keeping up and paying the soldiery; by which means they were in continual danger of being overpowered by the Arabians and Moors, who, if ever so little assisted by any Christian power, would hardly fail of driving all the Turks out of the kingdom. They represented to the Grand Vizier how much more honourable, as well as easier and cheaper, it would be for the Grand Signior to permit them to choose their own dey, or governor, from among themselves, whose interest it would then be to see that the revenue of the kingdom was rightly applied in keeping up its forces complete, and in supplying all other exigencies of the state, without any farther charge or trouble to the Porte than that of allowing them its protection. On their part, they engaged always to acknowledge the Grand Signiors as their sovereigns, and to pay them their usual allegiance and tribute, to respect their bailiwicks, and even to lodge and maintain them and their retinue, in a manner suitable to their dignity, at their own charge. The bailiwicks, however, were, for the future, to be excluded from afflicting at any but general douwans, unless invited to it; and from having the liberty of voting in them, unless when their advice was asked, or the interest of the Porte was likely to suffer by their silence. All other concerns, which related to the government of Algiers, were to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his douwan.\n\nThese proposals having been accepted by the Porte, Algerines the deputies returned highly satisfied; and having notified their new privileges, the great douwan immediately proceeded to the election of a dey from among themselves. They compiled a new set of laws, and made several regulations for the better support and maintenance of this new form of government, to the observation of which they obliged all their subjects to swear; and the militia, navy, commerce, &c., were all settled pretty nearly on the footing upon which they now are, and which shall be afterwards described; though the subsequent alterations that frequently happen between the bailiwicks and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, caused such frequent complaints and discontentants at the Ottoman court, as made them frequently repent their compliance.\nIn the year 1603, the Spaniards, under the command of Doria the Genoese admiral, made another attempt upon Algiers, in which they were more fortunate than usual, their fleet being only driven back by contrary winds, so that they came off without loss. In 1629, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocking in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able sailors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet so formidable as it became soon after; though it is probable the frequent attempts made on their city would also induce them to increase their fleet. In 1616, their fleet consisted of 40 sail of ships between 200 and 400 tons, their admiral 500 tons. It was divided into two squadrons, one of 18 sail, before the port of Malaga; and the other at the cape of Santa Maria, between Lisbon and Seville; both of which attacked all Christian ships, both English and French, with whom they pretended to be in friendship, as well as Spaniards and Portuguese, with whom they were at war.\n\nThe Algerines were now become very formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were most in danger, and least able to cope with them, solicited the affluence of England, the pope, and other states. The French, however, were the first who dared to show their resentment of the perfidious behaviour of these miscreants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was sent against them with a fleet of 50 men of war, who defeated their fleet, took two of their vessels, while their admiral sunk his own ship and crew, rather than fall into his enemies hands.\n\nIn 1620, a squadron of Englishmen of war was sent against Algiers, under the conduct of Sir Robert Manfle; but of this expedition we have no other account, than that it returned without doing anything; and the Algerines, becoming more and more insolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted; to whom, in 1625, they sent a proposal directed to the prince of Orange, that in case they would fit out 20 sail of ships the following year, upon any good service against the Spaniards, they would join them with 60 sail of their own.\n\nThe next year, the Couloiers, or Calaglies (the children of such Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers), who were enrolled in the militia, having feigned on the citadel, had well nigh made themselves masters of the city; but were attacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible slaughter. Many of them were put to death; and their heads thrown in heaps upon the city-walls, without the eastern gate. Part of the citadel was blown up; and the remaining Couloiers were dismissed from the militia, to which they were not again admitted till long after.\n\nIn 1623, the Algerines and other states of Barbary threw off their dependence on the Porte altogether, and let up for themselves. What gave occasion to this was the 25 years truce which Sultan Amurath IV. was obliged to make with the emperor Ferdinand II. to prevent his being overmatched by carrying on a war against him and the sophi of Persia at the same time. As this put a stop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and resolved, that whoever desired to be at peace with them, must distinctly and separately, apply to their government.\n\nNo sooner was this resolution taken, than the Algerines began to make prizes of several merchant ships belonging to powers at peace with the Porte. Nay, having seized a Dutch ship and palaacre at Scanderoon, they ventured on shore; and finding the town abandoned by the Turkish aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and warehouses, and set them on fire.—About this time Louis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coasts, instead of one formerly built by the Marilians, and which they had demolished. This, after some difficulty, he accomplished; and it was called the Bastion of France: but the situation being afterwards found inconvenient, the French purchased the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was so much embarrased with the Persian war, that there was no leisure to check the Algerine piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizier and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a share of their prizes, which were very considerable. However, for form's sake, a severe reprimand, accompanied with threats, was sent them; to which they replied, that \"these depredations deserved to be indulged to them, seeing they were the only bulwark against the Christian powers, especially against the Spaniards, the sworn enemies of the Mollem name;\" adding, that \"if they should pay a punctilious regard to all that could purchase peace, or liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but set fire to all their shipping, and turn camel-drivers for a livelihood.\"\n\nIn the year 1635, four younger brothers of a good Desperate family in France entered into an undertaking to defend Algiers, that perhaps the annals of knight-errantry can scarce furnish its equal.—This was no less than to re-brothers tort the piracies of the Algerines upon themselves; and as they indiscriminately took the ships of all nations, so were these heroes indiscriminately to take the ships belonging to Algiers; and this with a small frigate of ten guns!—In this ridiculous undertaking, 100 volunteers embarked; a Maltese commission was procured, together with an able master, and 36 mariners.—They had the good fortune, on their first setting out, to take a ship laden with wine, on the Spanish coast: with which they were so much elated, that three days after they madly encountered two large Algerine corsairs, one of 20 and the other of 24 guns, both well manned, and commanded by able officers. These two large vessels having got the small frigate between them, plied her furiously with great shot, which soon took off her main-mast: notwithstanding which, the French made so desperate a resistance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till the noise of their fire brought up five more Algerines; when the French vessel, being almost torn to pieces, was boarded and taken. The young knights-errant were punished for their temerity by a dreadful captivity, from which they redeemed themselves in 1642 at the price of 6000 dollars.\n\nThe Algerines prosecuted their piracies with im-A French punity, to the terror and disgrace of the Europeans, admiral till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidently driven to Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a release of all the captives of his nation, without exception. This being refused, the Frenchman without ceremony carried off the Turkish vice-roy,\nAlgiers, 107, and his cadet or judge, who had just arrived from the Porte, with all their equipage and retinue. The Algerines, by way of reprisal, surprized the Bastion of France already mentioned, and carried off the inhabitants to the number of 600, with all their effects; which so provoked the admiral, that he sent them word that he would pay them another visit the next year with his whole fleet.\n\nThe Algerines, undismayed by the threats of the French admiral, fitted out a fleet of 16 galleys and galliots, excellently manned and equipped, under the command of Admiral Hali Pinchinin.—The chief design of this armament was against the treasure of Loretto; which, however, they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Upon this they made a descent on Puglia in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Nocera, carrying off a vast number of captives, and among them some nuns. From thence steering towards Dalmatia, they scoured the Adriatic; and loading themselves with immense plunder, left those coasts in the utmost consternation and resentment.\n\nAt last the Venetians, alarmed at such terrible depredations, equipped a fleet of 28 sail, under the command of Admiral Capello, with express orders to burn, sink, or take, all the Barbary corsairs he met with, either on the open seas, or even in the Grand Signior's harbours, pursuant to a late treaty of peace with the Porte. On the other hand, the captain bashaw, who had been sent out with the Turkish fleet to chase the Florentine and Maltese cruisers out of the Archipelago, understanding that the Algerine squadron was so near, sent express orders to the admiral to come to his assistance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but having first resolved on a descent upon the island of Lissa, or Lissina, belonging to the Venetians, he was overtaken by Capello, from whom he retired to Valona, a sea port belonging to the Grand Signior, whither the Venetian admiral pursued him; but the Turkish governor refusing to eject the pirates according to the articles of the peace between the Ottoman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content himself with watching them for some time. Pinchinin was soon weary of restraint, and ventured out; when an engagement immediately ensued, in which the Algerines were defeated, and five of their vessels disabled, with the loss of 1500 men, Turks, and Christian slaves; besides 1600 galley slaves who regained their liberty. Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello; but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage before he received a letter from the senate, desiring him to make no farther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the Porte. This was followed by a letter from the governor of Valona, desiring him to take care lest he incurred the sultan's displeasure by such insults. The brave Venetian was forced to comply; but resolving to take such a leave of the Algerines as he thought they deserved, observed how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equipage along the shore. He then kept firing among their tents, while some well manned galliots and brigantines were ordered among their shipping, who attacked them with such bravery, that, without any great loss, they towed out their 16 galleys, with all their cannon, stores, &c.—In this last engagement a ball from one of the Venetian galleys happening to strike a Turkish mosque, the whole action was considered as an insult upon the Grand Signior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to sink all the Algerine ships he had taken, except the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello came off with a severe reprimand; but the Venetians were obliged to buy, with 500,000 ducats, a peace from the Porte. The Grand Signior offered to repair the loss of the Algerines by building ten galleys for them, upon condition that they should continue in his service till the end of the ensuing summer; but Pinchinin, who knew how little the Algerines chose to lie under obligations to him, civilly declined the offer.\n\nIn the mean time, the news of this defeat and loss Algiers filled Algiers with the utmost grief and confusion. The utmost whole city was on the point of a general insurrection, at when the bashaw and douwan issued a proclamation, news, forbidding not only complaints and utterances, under the severest penalties; but all persons whatever to take their thumbs from within their girdles, while they were deliberating on this important point. In the mean time they applied to the Porte for an order, that the Venetians settled in the Levant should make up their losses. But with this the Grand Signior refused to comply, and left them to repair their losses, as well as build new ships in the best manner they could. It was not long, however, before they had the satisfaction to see one of their corsairs land, with a fresh supply of 600 slaves, whom he had brought from the coast of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a different native taken on board a Danish ship.\n\nOur pirates did not long continue in their weak and defenceless state; being able, at the end of two years, out a new to appear at sea with a fleet of 6x sail. The admiral fleet. Pinchinin equipped four galliots at his own expense; with which, in conjunction with the Chiayah, or secretary of the bashaw of Tripoli, he made a second excursion. This small squadron, consisting of five galleys and two brigantines, fell in with an English ship of 40 guns; which, however, Pinchinin's captains refused to engage; but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they swore to attack the next Christian ship which came in their way. This happened Five of to be a Dutch merchantman, of 28 guns, which was their gal- deeply laden, and unable to use her sails by reason of heavy defeat a calm. Pinchinin immediately summoned her to surrender; but receiving an ironical answer, drew up his chantman squadron in form of a half moon, that they might pour their shot all at once into their adversary. This, however, the Dutchman avoided, by means of a breeze of wind which fortunately sprung up and enabled him to turn his ship; upon which the galleys ran foul of each other. Upon this, Pinchinin ran his own galley alongside of the merchantman, the upper deck of which 70 Algerines immediately took possession of, some of them cutting the rigging, and others plying the hatches with hand grenades; but the Dutchmen having secured themselves in their close quarters, began to fire at the Algerines on board, from two pieces of cannon loaded with small shot; by which they were all soon killed, or forced to submit. Pinchinin, in the mean time, made several unsuccessful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to surround the Dutchman with his other galleys; but that ship lay so deep in the water,\nwater, that every shot did terrible execution among the pirates; so that they were obliged to remove farther off. At last the Dutch captain, having ordered his guns to be loaded with cartouches, gave them such a parting volley as killed 200 of them, and sent the rest back to Algiers in a most dismal plight.\n\nBut though Pinheinian thus returned in disgrace, the rest of the fleet quickly came back with vast numbers of slaves, and an immense quantity of rich spoils; insomuch that the English, French, and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the mighty Algerines, who some time wished to be at peace with them, but swore eternal war against Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they looked upon as the greatest enemies to the Mahometan name. At last Louis XIV. provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coasts of Provence and Languedoc, ordered, in 1681, a considerable fleet to be fitted out against them, under the marquis du Quefne, vice-admiral of France. His first expedition was against a number of Tripolitan corsairs; who had the good fortune to outwit him, and shelter themselves in the island of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not, however, prevent him from pursuing them thither, and making such terrible fire upon them as quickly destroyed 14 of their vessels, besides battering the walls of the castle.\n\nThis severity seemed only to be designed as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding they still continued their outrages on the French coast, he sailed to Algiers in August 1682, cannonading and bombarding it so furiously, that the whole town was in flames in a very little time. The great mosque was battered down, and most of the houses laid in ruins, insomuch that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when on a sudden the wind turned about, and obliged Du Quefne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made reprisals, by sending a number of galleys and galliots to the coast of Provence, where they committed the most dreadful ravages, and brought away a vast number of captives: upon which a new armament was ordered to be got ready at Toulon and Marfelles against the next year; and the Algerines, having received timely notice, put themselves into as good a state of defence as the time would allow.\n\nIn May 1683, Du Quefne with his squadron cast anchor before Algiers; where being joined by the Marquis d’Affranville at the head of five stout vessels, it was resolved to bombard the town next day. Accordingly 100 bombs were thrown into it the first day, which did terrible execution; while the besieged made some hundred discharges of their cannon against them without doing any considerable damage. The following nights the bombs were again thrown into the city in such numbers, that the dey’s palace and other great edifices were almost destroyed; some of their batteries were dismantled, and several vessels sunk in the port. The dey and Turkish bashaw, as well as the whole garrison, alarmed at this dreadful havoc, immediately sued for peace. As a preliminary, the immediate surrender was inflicted on all Christian captives who had been taken fighting under the French flag; which being granted, 142 of them were immediately delivered up, with a promise of sending him the remainder as soon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accordingly Du Quefne sent his commissary-general and one of his engineers into the town; but with express orders to insist upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the effects they had taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hall Rais one of their captains should be given as hostages.\n\nThis last demand having embarrassed the dey, he assembled the council, and acquainted them with it; upon which Mezomorto fell into a violent passion, and told the assembly, that the cowardice of those who sat at the helm had occasioned the ruin of Algiers: but that, for his part, he would never consent to deliver up anything that had been taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the soldiery with what had passed; which so exasperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow chose Mezomorto in his place. This was no sooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of peace which had been made, and hostilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.\n\nThe French admiral now kept pouring in such volumes of bombs, that in less than three days the greatest and almost part of the city was reduced to ashes; and the fire destroyed, burnt with such vehemence, that the sea was enlightened with it for more than two leagues round. Mezomorto, unmoved at all these disasters, and the vast number of the slain, whose blood ran in rivulets along the streets; or rather, growing furious and desperate, fought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy; and, not content with causing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, ordered their confidants to be tied hand and foot, and fastened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from whence he was shot away against their navy.—By this piece of inhumanity Du Quefne was so exasperated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly destroyed all their fortifications, shipping, almost all the lower part, and above two-thirds of the upper part of the city, by which means it became little else than a heap of ruins.\n\nThe haughty Algerines were now thoroughly convinced that they were not invincible; and therefore for immediately sent an embassy into France, begging in peace, the most abject terms for peace; which Louis immediately granted, to their inexplicable joy. They now began to pay some regard to other nations, and to be a little cautious how they wantonly incurred their displeasure. The first bombardment by the French had so far humbled the Algerines, that they condescended to enter into a treaty with England; which was renewed upon terms very advantageous to the latter in 1686. It is not to be supposed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would disappear on a sudden; notwithstanding this treaty, therefore, they lost no opportunity of making prizes of the English ships when they could conveniently come at them. Upon some infringements of this kind, Captain Beach drove ashore their ships and burnt seven of their frigates in 1695; which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after; but it was not till the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, that Britain could have a sufficient check upon them to enforce the observance of treaties; and these have since proved such restraints upon Algiers, that they still continue to pay a greater deference to the English than to any other European power.\nThe present century furnishes no very remarkable events with regard to Algiers, except the taking of the famed city of Oran from the Spaniards in 1768 (which however they regained in 1737), and the expulsion of the Turkish bashaw, and uniting his office to that of dey in 1710. This introduced the form of government which still continues in Algiers.\n\nThe dey is now absolute monarch; and pays no other revenue to the Porte than that of a certain number of fine boys or youths, and some other presents which are sent thither yearly. His own income probably rises and falls according to the opportunities he has of fleecing both natives and foreigners; whence it is variously computed by different authors. Dr Shaw computes the taxes of the whole kingdom to bring into the treasury no more than 300,000 dollars; but supposes that the eighth part of the prizes, the effects of those persons who die without children, joined to the yearly contributions raised by the government, presents from foreigners, fines and oppressions, may bring in about as much more. Both the dey and officers under him enrich themselves by the same laudable methods of rapine and fraud; which it is no wonder to find the common people practising upon one another, and especially upon strangers, seeing they themselves are impoverished by heavy taxes and the injustice of those who are in authority.\n\nWe have already hinted, that the first deys were elected by the militia, who were then called the douwan or common council. This elective body was at first composed of 800 militia officers, without whose consent the dey could do nothing; and upon some urgent occasions all the officers residing in Algiers, amounting to above 1500, were summoned to assist. But since the deys, who may be compared to the Dutch stadtholders, have become more powerful, the douwan is principally composed of 50 chiah bashaws or colonels, with now and then the mufti and cadi upon some emergencies; and on the election of a dey, the whole body are allowed to come and give their votes. All the regulations of state ought to be determined by that assembly, before they pass into a law, or the dey hath power to put them in execution; but, for many years back, the douwan has been of so little account, that it is only convened out of formality, and to give assent to what the dey and his chief favourites have concerted beforehand. The method of gathering the votes in this august assembly is perfectly agreeable to the character of those who compose it. The aga, or general of the janizaries, or the president pro tempore, first proposes the question; which is immediately repeated with a loud voice by the chiah bashaws, and from them echoed again by officers called baj/baladars; from these the question is repeated from one member of the douwan to another, with strange contortions, and the most hideous growlings, if it is not to their liking. From the loudness of this growling noise, the aga is left to guess as well as he can whether the majority of the assembly are pleased or displeased with the question; and from such a preposterous method, it is not surprising that these assemblies should seldom end without some tumult or disorder. As the whole body of the militia is concerned in the election of a new dey, it is seldom carried on without blows and bloodshed; but when once the choice is made, the person elected is saluted with the words Alla Barick, \"God bless you, and prosper you;\" and the new dey usually causes all the officers of the douwan who had opposed his election to be strangled, filling up their places with those who had been most zealous in promoting it. From this account of the election of the dey, it cannot be expected that their government should be at all secure; and as they arrive at the throne by tumult, disorder, and bloodshed, they are generally deprived of it by the same means, scarcely one in ten of them having the good fortune to die a natural death.\n\nIn this country it is not to be expected that justice will be administered with any degree of impartiality. The Mahometan soldiery, in particular, are so much punished, that they are seldom put to death for any crime except rebellion; in which case they are either strangled with a bow string or hanged to an iron hook. In lesser offences, they are fined, or their pay stopped; and if officers, they are reduced to the station of common soldiers, from whence they may gradually rise themselves to their former dignity. Women guilty of adultery, have a halter tied about their necks, with the other end fastened to a pole, by which they are held under water till they are suffocated. The battaado is likewise inflicted for small offences; and is given either upon the belly, back, or soles of the feet, according to the pleasure of the cadi; who also appoints the number of strokes. These sometimes amount to 200 or 300, according to the indulgence the offender can obtain either by bribery or friends; and hence he often dies under this punishment for want of powerful enough advocates. But the most terrible punishments are those inflicted upon the Jews or Christians who speak against Mahomet or his religion; in which case, they must either turn Mahometans or be impaled alive. If they afterwards apostatize, they are burned or roasted alive, or else thrown down from the top of the city walls, upon iron hooks, where they are caught by different parts of their body according to how they happen to fall, and sometimes expire in the greatest torments; though by accident they may be put out of pain at once, as we have already related of the Spanish adventurer John Gafcon. This terrible punishment, however, begins now to be diffused.\n\nThe officer next in power to the dey is the aga of Aga of the janizaries, who is one of the oldest officers in the army, and holds his post only for two months. He is military of then succeeded by the chiah, or next senior officer.—ficers. During the two months in which the aga enjoys his dignity, the keys of the metropolis are in his hands; all military orders are issued out in his name; and the sentence of the dey upon any offending soldier, whether capital or not, can only be executed in the court of his palace.—As soon as he has gone through this short office, he is considered as masoul, or superannuated; receives his pay regularly, like the rest of the militia, every two moons; is exempt from all further duties, except when called by the dey to assist at the grand council, to which he hath, however, a right to come at all times, but hath no longer a vote in it. Next to the aga in dignity is the secretary of state, who registers all the public acts; and after him are the 30 chiahs or colonels, who sit next to the aga in the douwan, and in the same gallery with him. Out of this class are generally chosen those who go ambassadors to foreign\nAlgiers, reign courts, or who disperse the dey's orders throughout the realm. Next to them are 800 bullack bahaws or old captains, who are promoted to that of chiah bahaws according to their seniority. The old bahaws or lieutenants are next; who amount to 400, and are regularly raised to the rank of captains in their turn, and to other employments in the state, according to their abilities. These, by way of distinction, wear a leather strap, hanging down to the middle of their back. One rule is strictly observed in the rotation of these troops from one deputy to a higher, viz., the right of seniority; one single infringement of which would cause an insurrection, and probably cost the dey his life. Other military officers of note are the veke-lards or purveyors of the army; the peys, who are the four oldest soldiers, and consequently the nearest to pre-ferment; the foulacks, who are the next in seniority to them, and are part of the dey's body-guard, always marching before him when he takes the field, and distinguished by their carbines and gilt scimitars, with a brass gun on their caps; the kayts or Turkish soldiers, each band of whom has the government of one or more adowans or itinerant villages, and collect their taxes for the dey; and the sagiardi or Turkish lance-men, 100 of whom always attend the army, and watch over the water appointed for it. To these we may add the beys, or governors of the three great provinces of the realm. All the above-mentioned officers ought to compose the great douwan or council above mentioned; but only the 30 chiah bahaws have a right to sit in the gallery next after the dey; the rest are obliged to stand on the floor of the hall or council chamber, with their arms across, and as much as possible without motion; neither are they permitted to enter with their swords on, for fear of a tumult. As those who have any matters to transact with the douwan, they must stand without, let the weather be ever so bad; and there they are commonly presented with coffee by some of the inferior officers, till they are dismissed.\n\nAccount of commerce. It does not appear that the Algerines avail themselves of the benefit of their internal resources to commerce, the extent they might do; for their genius leads them too much to the piratical trade to mind any real advantage that might be derived from their own country. The corsairs or pirates form each a small republic, of which the rais or captain is the supreme bahaw; who, with the officers under him, form a kind of douwan, in which every matter relating to the vessel is decided in an arbitrary way. These corsairs are chiefly instrumental in importing whatever commodities are brought into the kingdom either by way of merchandise or prizes. These consist chiefly of gold and silver stuffs, damasks, cloths, spices, tin, iron, plated bras, lead, quicksilver, cordage, sail-cloth, bullets, cochinchin, linen, tartar, alum, rice, sugar, soap, cotton raw and spun, coppers, aloes, brazil and logwood, vermillion, &c. Very few commodities, however, are exported from this part of the world: the oil, wax, hides, pulse, and corn produced, being but barely sufficient to supply the country; though before the laws of Oran the merchants have been known to ship off from one or other of the ports of Barbary several thousand tons of corn. The consumption of oil, though here in great abundance, is likewise so considerable in this kingdom, that it is seldom permitted to be shipped off for Europe. The other exports consist chiefly in ostriches' feathers, copper, rugs, silk fathoms, embroidered handkerchiefs, dates, and Christian slaves. Some manufactures in silk, cotton, wool, leather, &c., are carried on in this country, but mostly by the Spaniards settled here, especially about the metropolis. Carpets are also a manufacture of the country; which, though much inferior to those of Turkey both in beauty and fineness, are preferred by the people to lie upon account of their being both cheaper and softer. There are also at Algiers looms for velvets, taffetas, and other wrought silks; and a coarse sort of linen is likewise made in most parts of the kingdom. The country furnishes no materials for ship-building. They have neither ropes, tar, sails, anchors, nor even iron. When they can procure enough of new wood to form the main timbers of a ship, they supply the rest from the materials of prizes which they have made; and thus find the secret of producing new and swift-sailing vessels from the ruins of the old. Of all the states on the coast of Barbary, the Algerines are the strongest at sea.\n\nThe religion of the Algerines is chiefly distinguished from that of the Turks by a greater variety of superstitious rites. The Koran is their acknowledged rule of faith and practice; but they are not very scrupulous in the observance of it. The mufti, or high-priest; the cadi, or chief judge; and the grand marabout, are the three principal officers who preside in matters of religion. The cadi attends in the court of justice once or twice every day, to hear and determine causes; but those of superior importance are submitted to the dey himself, or, in his absence, to one of the principal officers of the regency, who sits in the gate of the palace for that express purpose. Of this custom some traces are found in sacred history, Deut. xx. 11. 15. xxvi. 7.\n\nAlgiers, a city, the capital of the above kingdom, is probably the ancient Icosium: by the Arabians called Algezair, or rather Al-Jezir, or Al-Jezarah, i.e., the island, because there was an island before the city, to which it has since been joined by a mole. It is built on the declivity of a hill by the sea side, in the form of an amphitheatre: at sea, it looks like the top-sail of a ship. The tops of the houses are quite flat and white, and have all the appearance of a bleach-field. One house rises above another in such a manner that they do not hinder each other's prospect. The streets are so narrow, that they will scarcely admit two persons to walk abreast, and the middle part is lower than the sides. When any loaded boats, such as camels, horses, mules, or asses, pass along, you are forced to stand up close to the wall to let them pass by. There is but one broad street, which runs through the city from east to west, in which are the shops of the principal merchants, and the market for corn and other commodities. The lower part of the walls of the city is of hewn stone, and the upper part of brick; they are 30 feet high on the land side, and 40 towards the sea; the fosses or ditches are 20 feet broad and 7 deep. There is no sweet water in the city; and though there is a tank or cistern in every house, yet they often want water, because it rains but seldom: the chief supply is from a spring on a hill, the water of which is conveyed...\nAlgiers, conveyed by pipes to above a hundred fountains, at which a bowl is fastened for the use of passengers. The common reservoir is at the end of the mole, where the ships take in their water. Every one takes his turn at these places, except the Turks, who are first, and the Jews last. There are five gates, which are open from sunrise till sun-setting; and seven forts or castles without the walls, the greatest of which is on the mole without the gate, all of which are well supplied with great guns. There are 10 large mosques and 50 small ones; three great colleges or public schools, and a great number of petty ones for children. The houses are square, and built of stone and brick, with a square court in the middle, and galleries all around. There are said to be about 100,000 inhabitants in the city, comprehending 5000 Jewish families, besides Christians. There are four fundics or public inns, such as are in Turkey; and six causeries, or barracks, for the unmarried Turkish soldiers, which will hold 600 each. There are no inns for Christians to lodge at; but only a few tippling huts kept by slaves, for the accommodation of Greeks and the poorer sort of travellers, where anything may be had for money. Here are bagnios or public baths, in the same manner as in Turkey, at a very moderate rate. The women have baths of their own, where the men dare not come. Without the city there is a great number of sepulchres, as also cells or chapels, dedicated to marabouts or reputed saints, which the women visit every Friday. The Turkish soldiers are great tyrants; for they not only turn others out of the way in the streets, but will go to the farmhouses in the country for 20 days together, living at free quarters, and making use of every thing, not excepting the women. The Algerines eat, as in Turkey, sitting cross-legged round a table about four inches high, and use neither knives nor forks. Before they begin, every one says Be yme Allah, \"In the name of God.\" When they have done, a slave pours water on all their hands as they sit, and then they wash their mouths. Their drink is water, sherbet, and coffee. Wine is not allowed, though drank immoderately by some. The prospect of the country and sea from Algiers is very beautiful, it being built on the declivity of a mountain; but the city, though for several ages it has braved some of the greatest powers in Christendom, it is said, could make but a faint defence against a regular siege; and that three English fifty-gun ships might batter it about the ears of its inhabitants from the harbour. If so, the Spaniards must have been very deficient either in courage or conduct. They attacked it in the year 1775, by land and by sea, but were repulsed with great loss; though they had near 20,000 foot and 2000 horse, and 47 king's ships of different rates and 346 transports. In the years 1783 and 1784, they also renewed their attacks by sea to destroy the city and galleys; but after spending a quantity of ammunition, bombs, &c., were forced to retire without either its capture or extinction. The mole of the harbour is 500 paces in length, extending from the continent to a small island where there is a castle and large battery.\n\nE. Long. 2. 12. N. Lat. 36. 49.\n\nALGOA Bay, or Zwart-bops, in southern Africa, is situated in S. Lat. 33. 56. E. Long. 26. 53. and 500 miles distant from the Cape of Good Hope. Mr Barrow, who visited this place, found, in an adjoining valley, a species of antelope, called the rietjok, or red-goat, previously unknown to naturalists. He also mentions that great advantages might accrue to the East India Company from the erection of an establishment at this place, for the purpose of preparing salted beef and fish, in consequence of the salt-pans, and the abundance of large bullocks in the vicinity; together with great numbers of excellent fish with which the coast abounds.\n\nALGOL, a fixed star of the third magnitude, called Medusa's Head, in the constellation Perseus. Its longitude is 21° 50' 42\" of Taurus, and its latitude 23° 23' 47\" north; according to Flamsteed's catalogue. For an account of its changes, period, and other circumstances, see Astronomy Index.\n\nALGONQUINS, a nation in North America, who formerly possessed great tracts of land along the north shore of the river St Lawrence. For a long time they had no rivals as hunters and warriors, and were long in alliance with the Iroquois; whom they agreed to protect from all invaders, and to let them have a share of their venison. The Iroquois, on the other hand, were to pay a tribute to their allies, out of the culture of the earth; and to perform for them all the menial duties, such as flaying the game, curing the flesh, and dressing the skins. By degrees, however, the Iroquois associated in the hunting matches and warlike expeditions of the Algonquins; so that they soon began to fancy themselves as well qualified, either for war or hunting, as their neighbours. One winter a large detachment of both nations having gone out a hunting, and secured, as they thought, a vast quantity of game, fix young Algonquins and as many Iroquois were sent out to begin the slaughter. The Algonquins, probably becoming a little jealous of their associates, upon seeing a few elks, desired the Iroquois to return on pretence that they would have sufficient employment in flaying the game they should kill; but after three days hunting, having killed none, the Iroquois exulted, and in a day or two privately set out to hunt for themselves. The Algonquins were fo exasperated at seeing their rivals return laden with game, that they murdered all the hunters in the night time. The Iroquois dissembled their resentment; but in order to be revenged, applied themselves to study the art of war as practised among those savage nations. Being afraid of engaging with the Algonquins, at first they tried their prowess on other inferior nations, and, when they thought themselves sufficiently expert, attacked the Algonquins with such diabolical fury, as showed they could be satisfied with nothing less than the extermination of the whole race; which, had it not been for the interposition of the French they would have accomplished.—The few Algonquin nations, that are now to be seen, seem entirely ignorant of agriculture, and subsist by fishing and hunting. They allow themselves a plurality of wives; notwithstanding which, they daily decrease in population, few or none of their nations containing above 6000 souls, and many of them not 2000. Their language is one of the three radical ones in North America, being understood from the river St Lawrence to the Mississippi.\n\nALGOR, with Physicians, an unusual coldness in any part of the body.\n\nALGORITHM, an Arabic word expressive of numerical computation.\n\nALGUAZIL,\nALGUAZIL, in the Spanish polity, an officer whose business it is to see the decrees of a judge executed.\n\nALHAMA, a very pleasant town of the kingdom of Granada, in Spain, situated in the midst of some craggy mountains, about 25 miles S.W. of Granada, on the banks of the Rio Frio, in W. Long. 3° 26' N. Lat. 36° 39' and having the finest warm baths in all Spain. It was taken from the Moors in 1481. The inhabitants, though surprised, and the town without a garrison, made a gallant defense; but being at length forced to submit, the place was abandoned to the pillage of the Christian soldiers, who, not satisfied with an immense quantity of gold and jewels, made slaves of upwards of 3500 of the inhabitants.\n\nALHAMBRA, the ancient fortress and residence of the Moorish monarchs of Granada. It derives its name from the red colour of the materials which it was originally built with, Alhambra signifying a red house. It appears to a traveller a huge heap of ugly buildings as can well be seen, all huddled together, seemingly without the least intention of forming one habitation out of them. The walls are entirely unornamented, all gravel and pebbles, daubed over with plaster by a very coarse hand; yet this is the palace of the Moorish kings of Granada, indubitably the most curious place within that exiles in Spain, perhaps in the world. In many countries may be seen excellent modern as well as ancient architecture, both entire and in ruins; but nothing to be met with anywhere else can convey an idea of this edifice, except the decorations of an opera, or the tales of the genii.\n\nPaffing round the corner of the emperor's palace, one is admitted at a plain unornamented door in a corner. On my first visit, says Mr Swinburne, I confess I was struck with amazement, as I swept over the threshold, to find myself on a sudden transported into a species of fairy land. The first place you come to is the court called the communa or del melicar, that is the common bath; an oblong square, with a deep basin of clear water in the middle; two flights of marble steps leading down to the bottom; on each side a parterre of flowers, and a row of orange trees. Round the court runs a peristyle paved with marble; the arches bear upon very slight pillars, in proportions and style different from all the regular orders of architecture. The ceilings and walls are incrusted with fretwork in stucco, so minute and intricate, that the most patient draughtsman would find it difficult to follow it, unless he made himself master of the general plan. This would facilitate the operation exceedingly; for all this work is frequently and regularly repeated at certain distances, and has been executed by means of square moulds applied successively, and the parts joined together with the utmost nicety. In every division are Arabic sentences of different lengths, most of them expressive of the following meanings: \"There is no conqueror but God;\" or, \"Obedience and honour to our lord Abouabdoulah.\" The ceilings are gilt or painted; and time has caused no diminution in the freshness of their colours, though constantly exposed to the air. The lower part of the walls is mosaic, disposed in fantastic knots and festoons. A work so novel, so exquisitely finished, and so different from all that he had ever seen, must afford a stranger the most agreeable sensations while he treads this magic ground, Alhambra.\n\nThe porches at the ends are more like grotto-work than any thing else to which they can be compared. That on the right hand opens into an octagon vault, under the emperor's palace, and forms a perfect whispering gallery, meant to be a communication between the offices of both houses.\n\nOpposite to the door of the communa through which you enter, is another leading into the quarto de los leones, or apartment of the lions; which is an oblong court, 100 feet in length and 50 in breadth, environed with a colonnade 7 feet broad on the sides and 10 at the end. Two porticoes or cabinets about 15 feet square, project into the court at the two extremities. The square is paved with coloured tiles; the colonnade with white marble. The walls are covered five feet up from the ground with blue and yellow tiles, disposed chequerwise. Above and below is a border of small escutcheons, enamelled blue and gold, with an Arabic motto on a bend; signifying, \"No conqueror but God.\" The columns that support the roof and gallery are of white marble, very slender, and fantastically adorned. They are 9 feet high, including base and capital, and 8½ inches diameter. They are very irregularly placed; sometimes singly, at others in groups of three, but more frequently two together. The width of the horse-shoe arches above them is four feet two inches for the large ones, and three for the smaller. The ceiling of the portico is finished in a much finer and more complicated manner than that of the communa, and the stucco laid on the walls with inimitable delicacy; in the ceiling it is so artfully frosted and handled as to exceed belief. The capitals are of various designs, though each design is repeated several times in the circumference of the court, but not the least attention has been paid to placing them regularly or opposite to each other. Not the smallest representation of animal life can be discovered amidst the varieties of foliage, grotesques, and strange ornaments. About each arch is a large square of arabesques, surrounded with a rim of characters, that are generally quotations from the Koran. Over the pillars is another square of delightful filigree work. Higher up is a wooden rim, or kind of cornice, as much enriched with carving as the stucco that covers the part underneath. Over this projects a roof of red tiles, the only thing that disfigures this beautiful square. This ugly covering is a modern addition made by a late prime minister, who a few years ago gave the Alhambra a thorough repair. In Moorish times, the building was covered with large painted and glazed tiles, of which some few are still to be seen. In the centre of the court are twelve ill-made lions muzzled, their fore parts smooth, their hind parts rough, which bear upon their backs an enormous bafon, out of which a lesser rises. While the pipes were kept in good order, a great volume of water was thrown up, that, falling down into the bafons, palled through the beasts, and issued out of their mouths into a large reservoir, where it communicated by channels with the jet d'eau in the apartments. This fountain is of white marble, embellished with many festoons and Arabic ditiches, thus translated:\n\n\"Seest thou not how the water flows copiously like the Nile?\"\nThis resembles a sea washing over its shores, threatening shipwreck to the mariner.\n\nThis water runs abundantly, to give drink to the lions.\n\nTerrible as the lion is our king in the day of battle.\n\nThe Nile gives glory to the king, and the lofty mountains proclaim it.\n\nThis garden is fertile in delights: God takes care that no noxious animal shall approach it.\n\nThe fair princess that walks in this garden, covered with pearls, augment its beauty so much, that thou mayst doubt whether it be a fountain that flows, or the tears of her admirers.\n\nPalling along the colonnade, and keeping on the south side, you come to a circular room occupied by the men as a place for drinking coffee, &c. A fountain in the middle refreshed the apartment in summer. The form of this hall, the elegance of its cupola, the cheerful distribution of light from above, and the exquisite manner in which the stucco is designed, painted, and finished, exceed all powers of description. Every thing in it inspires the most pleasing voluptuous ideas: yet in this sweet retreat they pretend that Abouabdoulah assembled the Abencerrages, and caused their heads to be struck off into the fountain. Continuing your walk round, you are next brought to a couple of rooms at the head of the court, which are supposed to have been tribunals or audience chambers.\n\nOpposite to the Sala de los Abencerrajes is the entrance into the Torre de las dos hermanas, or the tower of the two sisters; so named from two very beautiful pieces of marble laid as flags in the pavement. This gate exceeds all the rest in profusion of ornaments, and in beauty of prospect which it affords through a range of apartments, where a multitude of arches terminate in a large window open to the country. In a gleam of sunshine, the variety of tints and lights thrown upon this enfilade are uncommonly rich. The first hall is the concert-room, where the women sit; the musicians played above in four balconies. In the middle is a jet d'eau. The marble pavement is equal to the finest existing, for the size of the flags and evenness of the colour. The two sisters which give name to the room, are slabs that measure 15 feet by 7½, without flaw or stain. The walls, up to a certain height, are mosaic, and above are divided into very neat compartments of stucco, all of one design, which is also followed in many of the adjacent halls and galleries. The ceiling is a fretted cove. To preserve this vaulted roof, as well as some of the other principal cupolas, the outward walls of the towers are raised 10 feet above the top of the dome, and support another roof over all, by which means no damage can ever be caused by wet weather or excessive heat and cold. From this hall you pass round the little myrtle garden of Lindaraza, into an additional building made to the east end by Charles V. The rooms are small and low. His dear motto, Plus oultre, appears on every beam. This leads to a little tower, projecting from the line of the north wall, called el recador, or the dressing-room of the sultana. It is a small square cabinet, in the middle of an open gallery, from which it receives light by a door and three windows. The look-out is charming. In one corner is a large marble flag, drilled full of holes, through which the smoke of perfumes ascended from furnaces below; and here, it is presumed, the Moorish queen was wont to sit to fumigate and sweeten her person. The emperor caused this pretty room to be painted with representations of his wars, and a great variety of grotesques, which appear to be copies, or at least imitations, of those in the loggie of the Vatican. From hence you go through a long passage to the hall of ambassadors, which is magnificently decorated with innumerable varieties of mosaics, and the mottos of all the kings of Granada. This long narrow antechamber opens into the commun on the left hand, and on the right into the great audience-hall in the tower of Comares; a noble apartment, 36 feet square, 36 high up to the cornice, and 18 from thence to the centre of the cupola. The walls on three sides are 15 feet thick, on the other 9; the lower range of windows 13 feet high. The whole wall is inlaid with mosaic of many colours, disposed in intricate knots, stars, and other figures. In every part various Arabic sentences are repeated.\n\nHaving thus completed the tour of the upper apartments, which are upon a level with the offices of the new palace, you descend to the lower floor, which consisted of bedchambers and summer-rooms; the back stairs and passages, that facilitated the intercourse between them, are without number. The most remarkable room below is the king's bedchamber, which communicated by means of a gallery with the upper story. The beds were placed in two alcoves, upon a raised pavement of blue and white tiles; but as it was repaired by Philip V, who passed some time here, it cannot be said how it may have been in former times. A fountain played in the middle, to refresh the apartment in hot weather. Behind the alcoves are small doors, that conduct you to the royal baths. These consist of one small closet with marble cisterns for washing children, two rooms for grown-up persons, and vaults for boilers and furnaces that supplied the baths with water and the stoves with vapours. The troughs are formed of large slabs of white marble; the walls are beautified with party-coloured earthen ware; light is admitted by holes in the coved ceiling.\n\nHard by is a whispering gallery, and a kind of labyrinth, said to have been made for the diversion of the women and children. One of the passages of communication is fenced off with a strong iron grate, and called the prison of the Sultana; but it seems more probable that it was put up to prevent any body from climbing up into the women's quarter.\n\nUnder the council-room is a long flue, called the king's study; and adjoining to it are several vaults, said to be the place of burial of the royal family. In the year 1574, four sepulchres were opened; but as they contained nothing but bones and ashes, were immediately closed again.\n\nThis description of the Alhambra may be finished by observing how admirably every thing was planned and calculated for rendering this palace the most voluptuous of all retirements; what plentiful supplies of water were brought to refresh it in the hot months of summer; what a free circulation of air was contrived, by the judicious disposition of doors and windows; what shady gardens of aromatic trees; what noble views over the beautiful hills and fertile plains! No wonder\nAli wondered the Moors regretted Granada; no wonder that they still offer up prayers to God every Friday for the recovery of this city, which they regard as a terrestrial paradise!\n\nAli, the son of Abu Taleb, is one of the most celebrated characters in Mahometan history. He was cousin to Mahomet; and at the age of fourteen engaged with youthful ardour in his cause. When Mahomet first revealed his prophetic character to his friends, and inquired who among them would undertake to be his companion, Ali exclaimed, \"O Prophet, I will be thy attendant; the man who dares to rise against thee I will break his legs, pluck out his eyes, dash out his teeth, and even rip up his belly.\" Mahomet accepted his services, and honoured him with the titles of brother, vicegerent, and Aaron to a new Moses. He was remarkable both for eloquence and valour; and the latter obtained him the surname of \"the Lion of God, always victorious.\" He succeeded to the chief dignity of the renowned house of Hashem, and was also hereditary guardian of the temple and city of Mecca. Mahomet gave him his daughter Fatimah in marriage, and the grandfather lived to embrace the children of his daughter. These advantages induced Ali to cast a wilful eye towards the regal succession; however, Abubeker, Omar, and Othman reigned before him. But after the death of the latter he was saluted caliph by the chiefs of the tribes, and the companions of the Prophet, when he was repairing to the mosque of Medina at the hour of prayer, A.D. 655. Hegir. 35.\n\nAyetha, the widow of the Prophet, strenuously opposed his succession; and under her influence two powerful chiefs soon raised the standard of rebellion. Ali greatly increased his difficulties by the imprudent removal of all the governors of provinces from their station. Telha and Zobeir, two chiefs of great influence, collected a numerous army, and induced Ayetha to attend them to the field of battle; but Ali gained a complete victory and took Ayetha prisoner. Telha fell in the field, and Zobeir was affiliated after surrendering upon promise of quarter. This dastardly action was severely reprehended by Ali. He likewise kindly treated the captive widow, and sent her back to the tomb of the Prophet.\n\nAli next attacked Moawiyah, who had been proclaimed caliph, and strongly supported by a powerful and numerous party. When the two armies approached each other, Ali proposed to decide the matter by single combat, but to this his opponent would not agree. Several skirmishes were fought with considerable loss on both sides; but at length a pious fraud produced a division of sentiment in the army of Ali. They fixed to the points of lances a number of copies of the Koran, carried them before the troops, and exclaimed, saying, \"This is the book which forbids Muslims to shed each other's blood, and ought therefore to decide our disputes.\" Ali was constrained to yield, and umpires were mutually chosen; on the side of Ali, Abu Moulla; Amru, the conqueror of Egypt, on the part of Moawiyah. The day of final decision arrived. Abu Moulla ascended the pulpit, and cried, \"As I draw this ring from my finger, so I depose both Ali and Moawiyah from the caliphate.\" When Amru ascended, he cried, \"As I put on this ring, so I invest Moawiyah with the caliphate, and also depose Ali.\" He also added, that Othman the former caliph had declared Moawiyah both his successor and avenger. Thus began that memorable contest among the Mahometans which was long agitated with considerable violence by both parties.\n\nAli was highly enraged at this injustice; but, constrained for the present to yield, he retired to Kufa. A sect of enthusiasts called the Kharejites revolted against Ali; but he quickly reduced them to subjection, and again obtained possession of Arabia. But Syria, Persia, and Egypt fell to the share of his rival.\n\nAn unexpected event terminated the existing disputes. Three Kharejites one day converging together concerning the blood which had been shed, and the impending calamities, resolved to assassinate Ali, Moawiyah, and Amru, the three authors of the present disasters. They provided themselves with poisoned swords, and hastened to accomplish their purpose. Moawiyah was wounded, but the wound did not prove fatal. A friend of Amru fell in his stead. Ali was fatally wounded at the door of the mosque, and in the sixty-third year of his age, he expired on the fifth day after his wound, A.D. 660. A.Hegir. 40.\n\nAli had eight wives besides Fatimah, and left a numerous family who were very remarkable for their valour. He also rose to high eminence for learning and wisdom; and of his works there are still extant a hundred maxims, a collection of verses, and a prophecy of all the great events which are to happen to the end of time. One of his sayings may be quoted as an example. \"He who would be rich without wealth, powerful without subjects, and a subject without a master, has only to forsake sin, and serve God.\"\n\nThe Mussulmans term Ali the heir of Mahomet, and the accepted of God, and his particular followers have possessed various states in Africa and Asia, and the Persian part of the Ufhe Tartars; and some love-reigns of India are at present of the feet of Ali. A monument is raised upon his tomb near Kufa, which the kings of Persia have successively decorated and religiously revered. Near the ruins of Kufa a city named Meftied Ali has been built to his memory. Some of his deluded followers imagine that he is still alive, and that he will revisit the earth and fill the same with justice. A green turban still continues to distinguish the descendants of Ali. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAli Bey, an eastern adventurer, is said to have been a native of Mount Caucasus, and about the age of twelve or fourteen he was sold for a slave in Cairo. The two Jews who became his masters presented him to Ibrahim, then one of the most respectable men in the kingdom. In the family of this powerful man he received the rudiments of literature, and was also instructed in the military art. Both in letters and military skill he made a rapid improvement. He gradually gained the affection of his patron to such a degree, that he gave him his freedom, permitted him to marry, promoted him to the rank of governor of a district; and afterwards by election he was raised to the elevated station of one of the governors of provinces. Deprived of his protector by death, and engaging in the dangerous intrigues that pave the way to power in that unstable government, he procured his own banishment to Upper-Egypt. Here he spent two years in maturing...\nhis schemes for future greatness, and in 1766, returning to Cairo, he either flew or expelled the beys, and seized the reins of government.\n\nEmboldened by success, he refused himself from the power of the Porte, coined money in his own name, and boldly assumed the rank of sultan of Egypt. Occupied in more important concerns, the Porte made no vigorous opposition to his measures, and Ali Bey seized this favourable opportunity to recover a part of the Sûd or Upper Egypt, which had been taken by an Arab sheik. Next he sent out a fleet from Suez, which seized upon Djedda, entered the port of Mecca; while a body of cavalry, commanded by Mohammed Bey his favourite, took and plundered Mecca itself. A young Venetian merchant laid before him a plan of reviving the ancient trade to the East Indies through the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Having formed an alliance, in 1772, with one Sheik Daher, a rebel against the Porte in Syria, he aimed at the conquest of all Syria and Palestine. He first endeavoured to secure Gaza; then his army forming a junction with that of Daher at a place called Acre, advanced to Damascus. On the 6th of June 1771, a battle was fought at this place with the Turkish pachas, and Mohammed and Daher the commanders of Ali Bey routed them with great slaughter. They instantly took possession of Damascus, and the castle itself had also capitulated, when all on a sudden Mohammed hastened back to Egypt with all his Mamelukes. Some ascribe this strange conduct to an impression made upon Mohammed by the Turkish agents, and others to a report of the death of Ali Bey.\n\nAlthough unsuccessful, Ali Bey never lost sight of his favourite object, and Mohammed losing his confidence was forced to save his life by exile. Mohammed, however, quickly returned with an army and drove Ali Bey from Cairo. In this unfortunate state of affairs Ali Bey fled to Daher, and combining their forces, they attacked the Turkish commander at Sidon, and came off victorious, although the Turkish army was three times their number. After a siege of eight months they next took the town of Jaffa. Deceived by letters from Cairo which were only intended to enflame him, and stimulated with recent victories, he returned to Cairo. Entering the deserts which divide Gaza from Egypt, he was furiously attacked by a thousand chosen Mamelukes led on by Murad Bey, who was enamoured with the beauty of Ali Bey's wife, and had obtained the promise of her, provided that he could take Ali Bey captive. Murad wounded and made Ali Bey prisoner, and carried him to Mohammed, who received him with affected respect; but in three days, either in consequence of poison or the effects of his wounds, Ali breathed his last.\n\nAli Bey was certainly a singular production in the school of ignorance and barbarity, and displayed a very great degree of original vigour of character and active penetration of mind. He is blamed for engaging in enterprises beyond his power to accomplish; but he is acknowledged to have been very favourable to the Franks, and to have governed Egypt with no small degree of steady moderation. He is also charged with devolving too much upon his lieutenants, and not being sufficiently attentive to the exactions made by his officers. Among his failings may also be ranked that of an unbounded confidence in his favourite. Generosity Aljameia and a sense of justice were not wanting in his character, although his morals, under the sanction of his clads and country, were strongly tainted with perfidy and murder in the pursuit of his ambitious plans. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALJAMEIA is a name which the Moriscos in Spain give to the language of the Spaniards. Among other articles agreed on by the junto, which was appointed by the emperor Charles V. in 1526, in favour of the Moriscos, this was one, that the Moriscos should no longer speak Algavareia, i.e. Moorish, or Arabic; but should all speak Aljameia, i.e. Spanish, as it was called by the Moors, and all their writings and contracts should be in that language.\n\nALIAS, in Law, a second or farther writ issued from the courts of Westminster, after a copias, &c. sued out without effect.\n\nALIBI, in Law, denotes the absence of the accused from the place where he is charged with having committed a crime; or his being elsewhere, as the word imports, at the time specified.\n\nALICANT, a large sea-port town in the province of Valencia, and territory of Segura. It is seated between the mountains and the sea, and has a castle deemed impregnable. The port is defended by three bastions furnished with artillery. To prevent the visits of the Algerine pirates, watch-towers were built to give notice of the approach of an enemy's ship. It was taken from the Moors in 1264. The castle was taken by the English in 1706, and held out a siege of two years before it was retaken by the French and Spaniards, and at last surrendered upon honourable terms, after part of the rock was blown up on which the castle stood, and the governor killed. The houses are high, and well built; and a very great trade is carried on here, particularly in wine and fruit. It is seated on the Mediterranean, on a bay of the same name, 37 miles north-east of Murcia, and 75 south of Valencia. W. Long. 0° 36'. N. Lat. 38° 24'.\n\nALICATA, a mountain of Sicily, near the valleys Mazara and Noto, upon which was situated (as is generally thought) the famous Dedalion, where the tyrant Phalaris kept his brazen bull.\n\nALICATA Chlamys, was a sort of vest with sleeves worn by the Roman boys till the age of thirteen, at which time they put on the pretexta.\n\nALIEN, in Law, implies a person born in a strange country, not within the king's allegiance; in contradistinction to a denizen or natural subject. The word is formed from the Latin alius, \"another;\" q.d., one born in another country. An alien is incapable of inheriting lands in Britain till naturalized by an act of parliament. No alien is entitled to vote at the election of members of parliament; nor can he enjoy any office, or be returned on any jury, unless where an alien is party in a cause, when the inquest is composed of an equal number of denizens and aliens. The reasons for establishing these laws were, that every man is professed to bear faith and love to that prince and country where he received protection during his infancy.\nALIEN; and that one prince might not settle spies in another's country; but chiefly that the rents and revenues of the country might not be drawn to the subjects of another. Some have thought that the laws against aliens were introduced in the time of Henry II. when a law was made at the parliament of Wallingford, for the expulsion of strangers, in order to drive away the Flemings and Picards introduced into the kingdom by the wars of King Stephen. Others have thought that the origin of this law was more ancient; and that it is an original branch of the feudal law: for by that law no man can purchase any lands but he must be obliged to do fealty to the lords of whom the lands are holden; so that an alien who owed a previous faith to another prince, could not take an oath of fidelity in another sovereign's dominions. Among the Romans only the Cives Romani were effectually freedmen; but when their territories increased, all the Italians were made free under the name of Latins, though they had not the privilege of wearing gold rings till the time of Justinian. Afterwards all born within the pale of the empire were considered as citizens.\n\nALIEN-Duty, an impost laid on all goods imported by aliens, over and above the customs paid for such goods imported by Britons, and on British bottoms.\n\nALIENS-Duty is otherwise called petty custom, and navigation duty.—Fish dried or salted, and cod-fish or herring not caught in British vessels and cured by British subjects, pay a double aliens-duty.—On what footing aliens are permitted to import foreign commodities into Great Britain, see Duty.\n\nALIEN-Priories, a kind of inferior monasteries, formerly very numerous in England, and so called from their belonging to foreign abbeys.\n\nALIENATION, in Law, denotes the act of making over a man's property in lands, tenements, &c., to another person.\n\nALIENATION in mortmain, is making over lands, tenements, &c., to a body politic, or to a religious house, for which the king's licence must first be obtained, otherwise the lands, &c., alienated will be forfeited.\n\nALIENATION in fee is the selling the fee-simple of any land or other incorporeal right. All persons who have a right to lands may generally alien them to others; but some alienations are prohibited; such as alienations by tenants for life, &c., whereby they incur a forfeiture of their estate. By the statute of Edward I., a bar was put to alienations by what we call entails, which is an expedient for procuring perpetuities in families; but counter-expedients were devised to defeat this intent, and a practice was introduced of cutting off entails by fines, and of barring remainders and reversions by recoveries. The statute for alienations in Henry VII.'s time had a great effect on the constitution of this kingdom; as, among other regulations of that reign, it tended to throw the balance of power more into the hands of the people. By the stat. 12 Car. II. cap. 24, fines for alienations are taken away. Crown lands are only alienable under a faculty of perpetual redemption. The council of Lateran, held in 1123, forbids any clerk to alienate his benefice, prebend, or the like. By the laws of the ancient Jews, lands could only be alienated for the space of 50 years. At each return of the jubilee all returned again to the primitive owners, or their descendants, to whom the lands were originally allotted at the first distribution of Canaan.\n\nALIENATION Office, is an office to which all writs of covenants and entry, upon which fines are levied, and recoveries suffered, are carried, to have fines for alienation set and paid thereon.\n\nALIMENT (from alio to nourish), implies food both solid and liquid: from which, by the process of digestion, is prepared a very mild, sweet, and whitish liquor, resembling milk, and distinguished by the name of chyle; which being absorbed by the lacteal veins, by them conveyed into the circulation, and there assimilated into the nature of blood, affords that supply of nutrition which the continual waste of the body is found to require.—Next to air, food is the most necessary thing for the preservation of our bodies; and as on the choice thereof our health greatly depends, it is of great importance to understand, in general, what is the proper diet for our nourishment; and, in particular deviations from health, what is the best adapted to restore us. The blood and fluids naturally incline to waste and diminish: fresh chyle, duly received, prevents this waste and diminution, and preserves in them that mild state which alone consorts with health. An animal diet affords the most of this bland nutritious mucilage; watery fluids dilute the too gross parts, and carry off what is become unfit for use. It is only the small portion of jelly which is separated from the farnaceous parts of vegetables, that, after being much elaborated, is converted into the animal nature; yet the use of vegetables prevents both repletion and a too great tendency to a putrefactive acrimony of the blood. In hot climates, as well as against the constitutional heat of particular persons, vegetables are demanded in the largest proportion. Animal substances afford the highest relish while our appetite continues; but will satiate the appetite before the stomach is duly filled. Vegetables may be eaten after either flesh or fish: few herbs or fruits satiate so much as that the stomach may not be filled with them, when it is already satisfied with flesh or fish; whence it may be observed, that no diet which is very nourishing can be eaten to fulness, because its nutritious parts are oily and satiating. Health depends almost wholly on a proper draft of the blood; and to preserve this a mixture of vegetables in some degree is always required, for a loathing is soon the consequence of animal food alone: hot acid habits, too, receive from milk and vegetables the needful for correcting their excesses; but in cold, pituitous, and nervous habits, who want most nourishment from least digestion, and from the smallest quantity of food, animal diet is to be used more freely.\n\nThus much being offered as general principles with respect to the matter and quality of our aliment, the valetudinarian may easily regulate his diet with some advantage to himself by an attention to the few ensuing particulars. In winter, eat freely, but drink sparingly: roast meat is to be preferred, and what is drunk should be stronger than at other seasons. In summer, let thirst determine the quantity to be drunk; cold stomachs never require much: boiled meats and vegetables, if not otherwise contraindicated, may now be more freely used. Lax habits require the winter's diet to be continued all the year, and rigid ones should be confined to that of summer. Fat people should fast\nALI\n\nAliquot at times, but the lean should never do so. Those who are troubled with eruptions occasioned by their food should drink but little, and use some unaccustomed exercise. The thirsty should drink freely, but eat sparingly. In general, let moderation be observed; and though no dinner hath been had, a light supper is at all times to be preferred. After very high seasoned meats, a glass of water acidulated with the acid elixir of vitriol, or in very weak stomachs the sweet elixir of vitriol, is far more afflignant to the work of digestion than the common method of taking brandy. See further Food and Drink.\n\nObligation of Aliment, in Scots Law, the natural obligation on parents to provide their children with the necessaries of life, &c. See Law Index.\n\nAlimentarii Pueri, &c., were certain children maintained and educated by the munificence of the emperors, in a sort of public places, not unlike our hospitals.—Trajan was the first who brought up any of these alimentary boys. He was imitated by Adrian. Antoninus Pius did the same for a number of maids, at the solicitation of Faustina; and hence, in some medals of that empress, we read PVEILLAE FAVSTINIANAE.—Alexander Severus did like at the request of Mamaea; and the maids thus educated were called Mammeae.\n\nAlimentary Duct or Canal, is a name given by Dr Tylor and some others to that part of the body through which the food passes from its reception into the mouth to its exit at the anus; including the gula, stomach, and intestines. See Anatomy.\n\nThis duct has been said to be the true characteristic of an animal, or (in the jargon of the schools) in proprium quarto modo; no animal being without it. Plants receive their nourishment by the numerous fibres of their roots; but have no common receptacle for digesting the food received, or for carrying off the recrements. But in all, even the lowest degree of animal life, we may observe a stomach and intestines, even where we cannot perceive the least formation of any organ of the senses, unless that common one of feeling, as in oysters. Phil. Trans. No. 269, p. 770, et seq.\n\nDr Wallis brings an argument from the structure of the alimentary tube in man, to prove that he is not naturally carnivorous; to which Dr Tyton makes some objections. Vid. Phil. Trans.

See Law Index.\n\nALIPILARIUS, or Alipilus, in Roman Antiquity, a servant belonging to the baths, whose business it was, by means of waxen plasters, and an instrument called volfella, to take off the hairs from the arm pits, and even arms, legs, &c., this being deemed a point of cleanliness.\n\nALIPERIUM, an aqua, in Antiquity, a place in the ancient palestrae, where the athlete were anointed before their exercises.\n\nALIQUANT PART, in Arithmetic, is that number which cannot measure any other exactly without some remainder. Thus 7 is an aliquant part of 16; for aliquot twice 7 wants two of 16, and three times 7 exceeds 16 by 5.\n\nALIQUOT PART, is that part of a number or quantity which will exactly measure it without any remainder. Thus 2 is an aliquot part of 4, 3 of 9, 4 of 16, &c.\n\nALISANDERS, or Alexander, in Botany. See Smyrnium, Botany Index.\n\nALISONTIA, or Alisuntia, in Ancient Geography, a river of Belgic Gaul, now Alfis; which, rising on the borders of Lorraine, and running through that duchy, waters the city of Luxemburg, and, swelled by other rivulets, falls into the Seine.\n\nALITES, in Roman Antiquity, a designation given to such birds as afforded matter of auguries by their flight.\n\nALKADARII, a sect among the Mahometans who deny any eternal, fixed, divine decrees, and are adherents of free-will. The word is formed from the Arabic alkadar, which signifies \"decree.\" The Alkadari are a branch of Mozazalites, and stand opposed to the Algiabarii. See Algiabarii.\n\nALKAHEST, or Alkahest, among Alchemists, derived from a word which signifies spirit of salt, or all-spirit, was supposed to be an universal menstruum capable of resolving all bodies into their first principles. Van Helmont pretended he was possessed of such a menstruum.—It is likewise used by some authors for all fixed salts volatilized.\n\nALKALLI, in Chemistry, denotes a particular class of salts. The word alkali is of Arabian origin, and was introduced into chemistry after it had been applied to a plant which still retains the name of kali. When this plant is burnt, the ashes walked in water, and the water evaporated to dryness, a white substance remains, which was called alkali. According to Albertus Magnus, who uses the word, it signifies sex amaritudinis, \"the dregs of bitterness.\" Alkali may be obtained from other substances besides kali. Chemists gradually discovered that bodies, differing from one another in several of their properties, had been confounded together under the same name. The word, in consequence, became general, and is now applied to all bodies which possess the following properties: 1. Incombustible. 2. A hot caustic taste. 3. Volatilized by heat. 4. Soluble in water even when combined with carbonic acid. 5. Capable of converting vegetable blues to green.\n\nThe alkalies at present known are three in number: 1. Potash; 2. Soda; 3. Ammonia. The two first are called fixed alkalies, because they require a red heat to volatilize them; the last is called volatile alkali, because it readily assumes a gaseous form, and consequently is dissipated by a very moderate degree of heat. See Chemistry Index.\n\n\"Alkali, or Sal Kali. See Salicornia, Botany Index.\n\nALKANET. See Anchusa, Botany Index.\n\nALKEENGI, the trivial name of a species of phyllis.

See Lawsonia, Botany Index.\n\nALKERMES, in Pharmacy, a compound cordial medicine made in the form of a confection, deriving its name from the kermes berries used in its composition.\n\nALKORAN,\nALL-Saints, in the Kalendar, denotes a festival celebrated on the first of November, in commemoration of all the saints in general; which is otherwise called All-Hallows. The number of saints being so excessively multiplied, it was found too burdensome to dedicate a feast day to each. In reality, there are not days enough, scarce hours enough, in the year, for this purpose. Hence an expedient was had recourse to, by commemorating such in the lump as had not their own days. Boniface IV, in the ninth century, introduced the feast of All-Saints in Italy, which was soon after adopted into the other churches.\n\nAll-Saints, islands near Guadaloupe, in the West Indies.\n\nAll-Saints, a parish in Georgetown district, South Carolina, containing 2225 inhabitants, of whom 429 are whites, and 1795 slaves. It sends a member to each house of the state legislature.\n\nAll-Saints Bay, a spacious harbour near St Salvador in Brazil, in S. America, on the Atlantic ocean, W. Long. 40°, S. Lat. 12°.\n\nAll-Saints Bay, a captainship in the middle division of Brazil, so called from the harbour of that name, bounded on the north by the Rio Real; on the south by that of Las Ilheos; on the east by the ocean; and on the west by three unconquered nations of Indians. It is reckoned one of the richest and most fertile captainships in all Brazil, producing great quantities of cotton and sugar. The bay itself is about two and a half leagues over, interspersed with a number of small but pleasant islands, and is of prodigious advantage to the whole country. It has several cities and towns, particularly St Salvador, which is its capital. All-Saints Bay lies in S. Lat. 12. 3. W. Long. 40. 10.\n\nSee Salvador.\n\nAll-Souls, in the Kalendar, denotes a feast-day, held on the second of November, in commemoration of all the faithful deceased.—The feast of All-Souls was first introduced in the eleventh century, by Odilon abbot of Cluny, who enjoined it on his own order; but it was not long before it became adopted by the neighbouring churches.\n\nAll-Spice. See Myrtus and Calycanthus, Botany Index.\n\nALLA, or Allah, the name by which the professors of Mahometanism call the Supreme Being.\n\nThe term alla is Arabic, derived from the verb alah, to adore. It is the same with the Hebrew Eloah, which signifies the Adorable Being.\n\nALLAHABAD, in Geography, a province of Hindostan, about 162 miles in length, and 120 in breadth. Its eastern boundaries meet the province of Bahar, the southern Berar, the western Malwa and Agra, and the northern Oude. According to the distribution of the emperor Akbar, recorded in the Ayeen Akberry; it contains 10 circars or counties, which are divided into 1777 pargunahs or hundreds. According to the statement of Maurice, in his Indian antiquities, it affords a revenue of 3,310,695 seca rupees. It contributes to the public service 323 elephants, 237,870 infantry, and 11,375 cavalry. Azuh Dowlia, a tributary ally of Allamanda the British power, possesses the greater part of this province. Allahabad, Benares, and Iconpour, are the principal cities.\n\nAllahabad, the capital of the above province, is situated at the confluence of the great rivers Jumna and Ganges. This city is divided into two parts, called the Old and the New Town: The old is situated upon the Ganges, and the new upon the Jumna. The emperor Akbar erected a strong fortress of stone, which occupies a large space in this city, and from him it received its present name. Of this fortress, Mr Hodges, in No IV. of his select views in India, gives an accurate and elegant delineation. A pillar consisting of one stone 40 feet high, ascribed by tradition to Bima, one of the heroes of Mahabarat, wholly covered with illegible inscriptions, and the elegant tomb of Sultan Khurfu, are excellent specimens of Mahometan architecture. Devotion has fixed her residence, and flourishes to such a degree in this city, that it hath obtained the appellation of \"the king of worshipped places.\" According to the evidence of the Ayeen-Akberry, the adjacent territory, to the extent of 40 miles, is deemed holy ground. In such veneration is this place held by the Hindoos, that when a man dies here, they believe he will obtain the utmost of his wishes in his next regeneration. They deem it a meritorious action for a man to slay himself, although they teach that suicide will be punished with torments in a future state. In and about this city there are various objects of veneration, which immense numbers of pilgrims continue to visit with great devotion. Major Rennel has placed Palibothra on the same site with Patna; but Dr Robertson is of opinion that the ancient Palibothra is the modern city of Allahabad. N. Lat. 25. 27. E.

See Anatomy Index.\n\nAllatius, Leo, keeper of the Vatican library, a native of Scio, and a celebrated writer of the 17th century. He was of great service to the gentlemen of Port Royal in the controversy they had with M. Claude touching the belief of the Greeks with regard to the eucharist. No Latin was ever more devoted to the see of Rome, or more inveterate against the Greek schismatics, than Allatius. He never was married; nor did he take orders; and Pope Alexander VII. having asked him one day, why he did not enter into orders? he answered, Because I would be free to marry.\" The pope rejoined, \"If so, why do you not marry?\" \"Because,\" replied Allatius, \"I would not be at liberty to take orders.\" Thus, as Mr Bayle observes, he passed his whole life, wavering betwixt a parish and a wife; forry, perhaps, at his death, for having chosen neither of them; when, if he had fixed upon one, he might have repented his choice for 30 or 40 years.—If we believe John Patricius, Allatius had a very extraordinary pen, with which, and no other, he wrote Greek for 40 years; at the loss of which, he was so grieved.\nAllay grieved as to lament it with tears. He published several manuscripts, several translations of Greek authors, and several pieces of his own composing. In his works he discovers more erudition and industry than found judgment. His manner of writing is diffuse and perplexed, making frequent digressions from one subject to another. He died at Rome in 1669, aged 83.\n\nALLAY. See Allay.\n\nALLECTUS, the prime minister and confidential friend of Carausius, emperor of Britain. In order to avoid the punishment due to the several enormous crimes with which he was chargeable, he fell upon the desperate expedient of murdering his master, and usurping the imperial dignity, which he maintained for three years. With a design of recovering Britain, Constantius about this period fitted out a large squadron, which being assembled in the mouth of the Seine, the command was devolved upon the prefect Asclepiodotus. The fleet of Allectus was stationed off the Isle of Wight to receive them; but under the cover of a thick fog, the invaders escaped their notice, and landed in safety on the western coast, and, according to Gibbon, convinced the Britons \"that a superiority of naval strength will not always protect their country from a foreign invasion.\" No sooner had the intrepid commander disembarked his forces, than he set fire to his ships, and marched forward to meet the enemy. In expectation of an attack from Constantius, who commanded the fleet off Boulogne, the usurper had taken his station in the vicinity of London; but informed of the defeat of Asclepiodotus, he made forced marches to oppose his progress. Allectus attacked the imperial troops, and his army being reduced to a small number of fatigued and dispirited men, he fell in the field, and his forces received a total defeat. Thus, in one day, and by a single battle, the fate of this great island was decided; and Britain, after a separation of 10 years, was restored to the Roman empire, A.D. 297. Constantius landing on the shores of Kent, was saluted with the loud applause and unanimous acclamations of obedient subjects, and welcomed to the British soil.\n\nALLEGATA, a word anciently subscribed at the bottom of recripts and constitutions of the emperors; as signata, or tektata, was under other infrumens.\n\nALLEGAS, or ALLEGAS, a fluff manufactured in the East Indies. There are two sorts of them; some are of cotton, and others of several kinds of herbs, which are spun like flax and hemp. Their length and breadth are of eight ells, by five, fix, or seven eighths; and of twelve ells, by three-fourths or five-eighths.\n\nALLEGHANY, is the most western county in Maryland, and has Pennsylvania on the north. The windings of the Patowmac river separate it from Virginia on the south, and Sideling-hill Creek divides it from Washington county on the east. It contains 4809 inhabitants, including 258 slaves. Cumberland is its chief town.\n\nAlleghany County, in Pennsylvania, extends from the junction of the river of that name with the Ohio, where its chief town, Pittsburgh, is situated, to the New-York line. It contains 10,309 inhabitants, including 159 slaves.\n\nAlleghany Mountains, between the Atlantic ocean, the Mississippi river, and the lakes, are a long and broad range of mountains, made up of a great number of ridges, extending north-easterly and south-Alleghany, westerly, nearly parallel to the sea coast, about 900 Alleghany miles in length, and from 60 to 150 and 250 miles in breadth. Mr. Evans observes, with respect to that part of these mountains which he travelled over, viz., in the back parts of Pennsylvania, that scarcely one acre in ten is capable of culture. This, however, is far from being the case in all parts of this range. Numerous tracts of fine arable and grazing land intervene between the ridges. The different ridges which compose this immense range of mountains, have different names in the different states, viz., the Blue Ridge, the North Mountain, or North Ridge, or Devil's Back-Bone, Laurel Ridge, Jackson's Mountains, and Kittatinny Mountains. All these different and immense ridges, except the Alleghany, are broken through by rivers, which appear to have forced their way through solid rocks. This principal ridge is more immediately called Alleghany, and is descriptively named the Backbone of the United States. From these several ridges proceed innumerable branches, or spurs.\n\nThe general name of the whole range, taken collectively, seems not yet to have been determined. Mr. Evans calls them the Endless Mountains; others have called them the Appalachian Mountains, from a tribe of Indians who live on a river which proceeds from this mountain, called the Appalachiola; but the most common name is the Alleghany Mountains, so called, probably, from the principal ridge of the range. These mountains are not confusedly scattered, rising here and there into high peaks, towering each other; but run along in uniform ridges, scarcely half a mile high. They spread as you proceed south, and some of them terminate in high perpendicular bluffs; others gradually subside into a level country, giving rise to the rivers which run southerly into the gulf of Mexico.\n\nAlleghany River, in Pennsylvania, rises on the western side of the Alleghany mountains, and after running about 200 miles in a south-west direction, meets the Monongahela at Pittsburg, and both united form the Ohio. The lands on each side of this river, for 150 miles above Pittsburg, consist of white oak and chestnut ridges, and in many places of poor pitch pines, interspersed with tracts of good land, and low meadows. This river, and the Ohio likewise, from its head waters until it enters the Mississippi, are known and called by the name of Alleghany River, by the Seneca, and other tribes of the Six Nations, who once inhabited it.\n\nALLEGIANCE, in Law, is the tie, or ligamen, which binds the subject to the king, in return for that protection which the king affords the subject. The thing itself, or substantial part of it, is founded in reason and the nature of government; the name and the form are derived to us from our Gothic ancestors. Under the feudal system, every owner of lands held them in subjection to some superior or lord, from whom or from whose ancestors the tenant or vassal had received them; and there was a mutual trust or confidence subsisting between the lord and vassal, that the lord should protect the vassal in the enjoyment of the territory he had granted him; and, on the other hand, that the vassal should be faithful to the lord, and defend him against all his enemies. This obligation on the part of the vassal was called his fidelitas.\nAllegiance, fidelitas or fealty; and an oath of fealty was required by the feudal law to be taken by all tenants to their landlord, which is couched in almost the same terms as our ancient oath of allegiance; except that, in the usual oath of fealty, there was frequently a favoring or exception of the faith due to a superior lord by name, under whom the landlord himself was perhaps only a tenant or vassal. But when the acknowledgment was made to the absolute superior himself, who was vassal to no man, it was no longer called the oath of fealty, but the oath of allegiance; and therein the tenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign lord, in opposition to all men, without any favoring or exception. Land held by this exalted species of fealty, was called feudum ligium, a liege fee; the vassals homines ligii, or liege men; and the sovereign, their dominus ligius, or liege lord. And when sovereign princes did homage to each other for lands held under their respective sovereignties, a distinction was always made between simple homage, which was only an acknowledgment of tenure; and liege homage, which included the fealty before mentioned, and the services consequent upon it. In Britain, it becoming a fettered principle of tenure, that all lands in the kingdom are holden of the king as their sovereign and lord paramount, no oath but that of fealty could ever be taken to inferior lords; and the oath of allegiance was necessarily confined to the person of the king alone. By an easy analogy, the term of allegiance was soon brought to signify all other engagements which are due from subjects to their prince, as well as those duties which were simply and merely territorial. And the oath of allegiance, as administered in England for upwards of 600 years, contained a promise \"to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour, and not to know or hear of any ill or damage intended him, without defending him therefrom.\" But, at the Revolution, the terms of this oath being thought perhaps to favour too much the notion of non-resistance, the present form was introduced by the convention parliament, which is more general and indeterminate than the former; the subject only promising \"that he will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the king,\" without mentioning \"his heirs,\" or specifying in the least wherein that allegiance confits. The oath of supremacy is principally calculated as a renunciation of the pope's pretended authority; and the oath of abjuration, introduced in the reign of King William, very amply supplies the loose and general texture of the oath of allegiance; recognizing the right of his majesty, derived under the act of settlement; engaging to support him to the utmost of the juror's power; promising to disclose all traitorous conspiracies against him; and expressly renouncing any claim of the defendants of the late pretender, in as clear and explicit terms as the English language can furnish. This oath must be taken by all persons in any office, trust, or employment; and may be tendered by two justices of the peace to any person whom they shall suspect of disaffection. And the oath of allegiance may be tendered to all persons above the age of twelve years, whether natives, denizens, or aliens.\n\nBut, besides these express engagements, the law also holds that there is an implied, original, and virtual allegiance, owing from every subject to his sovereign, antecedently to any express promise, and although the subject never swore any faith or allegiance in form. Thus Sir Edward Coke very justly observes, that \"all subjects are equally bounden to their allegiance as if they had taken the oath; because it is written by the finger of the law in their hearts, and the taking of the corporal oath is but an outward declaration of the same.\"\n\nAllegiance, both express and implied, is however distinguished by the law into two sorts or species, the one natural, the other local; the former being also perpetual, the latter temporary.\n\nNatural allegiance is such as is due from all men born within the king's dominions immediately upon their birth. For, immediately upon their birth, they are under the king's protection; at a time too, when (during their infancy) they are incapable of protecting themselves. Natural allegiance is, therefore, a debt of gratitude; which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or altered, by any change of time, place, or circumstance, nor by anything but the united concurrence of the legislature. A Briton who removes to France, or to China, owes the same allegiance to the king of Britain there as at home, and 20 years hence as well as now. For it is a principle of universal law, That the natural born subject of one prince cannot by any act of his own, no, not by swearing allegiance to another, put off or discharge his natural allegiance to the former; for this natural allegiance was intrinsic and primitive, and antecedent to the other; and cannot be divested without the concurrent act of that prince to whom it was first due.\n\nLocal allegiance is such as is due from an alien, or stranger born, for so long time as he continues within, the king's dominion and protection; and it ceases the instant such stranger transfers himself from this kingdom to another. Natural allegiance is therefore perpetual, and local temporary only; and that for this reason, evidently founded upon the nature of government. That allegiance is a debt due from the subject, upon an implied contract with the prince; that so long as the one affords protection, so long the other will demean himself faithfully.\n\nThe oath of allegiance, or rather the allegiance itself, is held to be applicable, not only to the political capacity of the king, or regal office, but to his natural person and blood royal; and for the misapplication of their allegiance, viz. to the regal capacity or crown, exclusive of the person of the king, were the Spencers banished in the reign of Edward II. And from hence arose that principle of personal attachment and affectionate loyalty, which induced our forefathers (and, if occasion required, would doubtless induce their sons) to hazard all that was dear to them, life, fortune, and family, in defence and support of their liege lord and sovereign.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, in explanation of this allegiance, That it does not preclude resistance to the regal and regal king, when his misconduct or weakness is such as to make resistance beneficial to the community. It seems fairly presumable, that the convention parliament, which introduced the oath of allegiance in its present form, did not intend to exclude all resistance: since the\nAllegory. very authority by which the members sat together, was itself the effect of a successful opposition to an acknowledged sovereign.\n\nAgain: The allegiance above described can only be understood to signify obedience to lawful commands. If, therefore, the king should issue a proclamation, levying money or imposing any service or restraint upon the subject, beyond what the law authorized, there would exist no sort of obligation to obey such a proclamation, in consequence of having taken the oath of allegiance.\n\nNeither can allegiance be supposed to extend to the king after he is actually and absolutely deposed, driven into exile, or otherwise rendered incapable of exercising the regal office. The promise of allegiance implies, that the person to whom the promise is made continues king; that is, continues to exercise the power, and afford the protection, which belong to the office of king; for it is the possession of these which makes such a particular person the object of the oath.\n\nALLEGORY, in Composition, consists in choosing a secondary subject, having all its properties and circumstances resembling those of the principal subject, and describing the former in such a manner as to represent the latter. The principal subject is thus kept out of view, and we are left to discover it by reflection. In other words, an allegory is, in every respect, similar to a hieroglyphical painting, excepting only that words are used instead of colours. Their effects are precisely the same: A hieroglyphic raises two images in the mind; one seen, that represents one that is not seen: An allegory does the same; the representative subject is described, and the resemblance leads us to apply the description to the subject represented.\n\nThere cannot be a finer or more correct allegory than the following, in which a vineyard is made to represent God's own people the Jews:\n\n\"Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it. Thou didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with its shadow, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars. Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all that pass do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast doth devour it. Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine and the vineyard thy right hand hath planted, and the branch thou madest strong for thyself.\" Psa. lxxx.\n\nNothing gives greater pleasure than an allegory, when the representative subject bears a strong analogy, in all its circumstances, to that which is represented. But most writers are unlucky in their choice, the analogy being generally so faint and obscure, as rather to puzzle than to please. Allegories, as well as metaphors and similes, are unnatural in expressing any fervent passion which totally occupies the mind. For this reason, the following speech of Macbeth is justly condemned by the learned author of the Elements of Criticism:\n\nMethought I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more! Macbeth doth murder Sleep; the innocent sleep; Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of Care, The birth of each day's life, fore Labour's bath,\n\nBalm of hurt minds, great Nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast.\n\nAct ii. Sc. 3.\n\nBut see this subject more fully treated under the article METAPHOR and Allegory.\n\nALLEGRI, ANTONIO, called Correggio from the place of his birth, an eminent historical painter, was born in the year 1494. Being descended of poor parents, and educated in an obscure village, he enjoyed none of those advantages which contributed to form the other great painters of that illustrious age. He saw none of the statues of ancient Greece or Rome; nor any of the works of the established schools of Rome and Venice. But Nature was his guide; and Correggio was one of her favourite pupils. To express the facility with which he painted, he used to say that he always had his thoughts ready at the end of his pencil.\n\nThe agreeable smile, and the profusion of graces, which he gave to his madonas, saints, and children, have been taxed with being sometimes unnatural; but still they are amiable and seducing: An easy and flowing pencil, an union and harmony of colours, and a perfect intelligence of light and shade, give an astonishing relief to all his pictures, and have been the admiration both of his contemporaries and his successors. Annibal Caracci, who flourished 50 years after him, studied and adopted his manner in preference to that of any other master. In a letter to his cousin Louis, he expressed with great warmth the impression which was made on him by the first sight of Correggio's paintings: \"Every thing which I see here (says he) astonishes me; particularly the colouring and the beauty of the children. They live—they breathe—They smile with so much grace and so much reality, that it is impossible to refrain from smiling and partaking of their enjoyment. My heart is ready to break with grief when I think on the unhappy fate of poor Correggio—that so wonderful a man (if he ought not rather to be called an angel) should finish his days so miserably, in a country where his talents were never known!\"\n\nFrom want of curiosity or of resolution, or from want of patronage, Correggio never visited Rome, but remained his whole life at Parma, where the art of painting was little esteemed, and of consequence poorly rewarded. This concurrence of unfavourable circumstances occasioned at last his premature death at the age of 40. He was employed to paint the cupola of the cathedral at Parma, the subject of which is an assumption of the Virgin: and having executed it in a manner that has long been the admiration of every person of good taste, for the grandeur of design, and especially for the boldness of the fore-shortenings (an art which he first and at once brought to the utmost perfection), he went to receive his payment. The canons of the church, either through ignorance or bafeness, found fault with his work; and although the price originally agreed upon had been very moderate, they alleged that it was far above the merit of the artist, and forced him to accept of the paltry sum of 200 livres; which, to add to the indignity, they paid him in copper money. To carry home this unworthy load to his indigent wife and children, poor Correggio had to travel five or eight miles from Parma. The weight of\nof his burden, the heat of the weather, and his chagrin at this villainous treatment, immediately threw him into a pleurisy, which in three days put an end to his life and his misfortunes.\n\nFor the preservation of this magnificent work the world is indebted to Titian. As he passed through Parma, in the suite of Charles V., he ran instantly to see the chef d'œuvre of Corregio. While he was attentively viewing it, one of the principal canons of the church told him that such a grotesque performance did not merit his notice, and that they intended soon to have the whole defaced. \"Have a care of what you do,\" replied the other, \"If I were not Titian, I would certainly wish to be Corregio.\"\n\nCorregio's exclamation upon viewing a picture by Raphael is well known. Having long been accustomed to hear the most unbounded applause bestowed on the works of that divine painter, he by degrees became less desirous than afraid of seeing any of them. One, however, he at last had occasion to see. He examined it attentively for some minutes in profound silence; and then with an air of satisfaction exclaimed, \"I am still a painter.\" Julio Romano, on seeing some of Corregio's pictures at Parma, declared they were superior to anything in painting he had yet beheld. One of these no doubt would be the famous Virgin and Child, with Mary Magdalen and St. Jerome; but whether our readers are to depend upon his opinion, or upon that of Lady Millar, who in her Letters from Italy gives a very unfavourable account of it, we shall not presume to determine. This lady, however, speaks in a very different style of the less famous Notti, or Night of Corregio, of which she saw only a copy in the Duke's palace at Modena, the original having been sold for a great sum of money to the king of Poland. \"It surprises me very much (says she), to see how different the characters are in this picture from that which I already have described to you. The subject is a Nativity; and the extraordinary beauty of this picture proceeds from the clair obscuré; there are two different lights introduced, by means of which the personages are visible; namely, the light proceeding from the body of the child, and the moonlight. These two are preserved distinct, and produce a most wonderful effect. The child's body is so luminous, that the superficies is nearly transparent, and the rays of light emitted by it are verified in the effect they produce upon the surrounding objects. They are not rays distinct and separate, like those round the face of a sun that indicates an insurance office; nor linear, like those proceeding from the man in the almanack; but of a dazzling brightness: by their light you see clearly the face, neck, and hands, of the Virgin (the rest of the person being in strong shadow), the faces of the pallori who crowd round the child, and particularly one woman, who holds her hand before her face, lest her eyes should be so dazzled as to prevent her from beholding the infant. This is a beautiful natural action, and is most ingeniously introduced. The straw on which the child is laid appears gilt, from the light of his body shining on it. The moon lights up the background of the picture, which represents a landscape. Every object is distinct, as in a bright moonlight night; and there cannot be two lights in nature more different than those which appear in the same picture. The virgin and the child are of the most perfect beauty. There is a great variety of character in the different persons present, yet that uniformity common to all herdsmen and peasants. In short, this copy is so admirable, that I was quite sorry to be obliged to lose sight of it so soon; but I never shall forget it. The duke of Modena, for whom Corregio did the original picture, gave him only 600 livres of France for it; a great sum in those days: but at present, what ought it to cost?\" This great painter's death happened in 1534.\n\nALLEGRI, Gregorio, an ecclesiastic by profession, and a celebrated composer of music of the 17th century, was a native of Rome. He was the disciple of Nanni, the intimate friend and contemporary of Palestrina. His abilities as a singer were not remarkable, but he was deemed an excellent master of harmony; and so much respected by all the musical professors of his time, that the pope, in the year 1629, appointed him to be one of the singers of his chapel. To his uncommon merit as a composer of church music, he united an excellent moral character, exhibiting in his actions the devotion and benevolence of his heart. The poor crowded daily to his door, whom he relieved to the utmost of his ability; and not content with these beneficent actions, he daily visited the prisons of Rome, in order to relieve the most deserving and afflicted objects which were immured in these dreary mansions. With such divine simplicity and purity of harmony, did he compose many parts of the church service, that his lofs was feverishly felt and sincerely lamented by the whole college of singers in the papal service. He died Feb. 18, 1652, and was interred in the Chiesa Nuova, in a vault destined for the reception of deceased singers in the pope's chapel, before the chapel of S. Filippo Neri, near the altar of annunciation.\n\nAmong his other musical works preserved in the pontifical chapel, is the celebrated miérere, which, for 170 years, has been annually performed at that chapel on Wednesday and Good Friday, in Passion-week, by the choral band, and the best singers in Italy. It is, however, generally believed, that it owes its reputation more to the manner in which it is performed, than to the composition itself. The beauty and effect of the music is not discernible upon paper, but the fingers have, by tradition, certain customs, expressions, and graces of convention, which produce wonderful effects. Some of the effects produced may be justly attributed to the time, the place, and the solemnity of the ceremonials observed during the performance. \"The pope and conclave are all prostrated on the ground, the candles of the chapel and the torches of the balustrade are extinguished one by one, and the last verse of this psalm is terminated by two choirs; the maglia di capello beating time slower and slower, and the fingers diminishing, or rather extinguishing the harmony by little and little, to a perfect point.\" Padre Martini says, that there were never more than three copies made by authority, \"one of which was for the emperor Leopold, one for the late king of Portugal, and the other for himself; but a very complete one was presented by the pope himself to King George III., as an inestimable curiosity.\" (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALLEGRO, in Music, an Italian word, denoting\nAllein, that the part is to be played in a sprightly, brisk, lively, and gay manner.\n\nPiu Allegro signifies, that the part it is joined to should be sung or played quicker; as\n\nPoco piu Allegro intimates, that the part to which it refers ought to be played or sung only a little more briskly than allegro alone requires.\n\nAllein, Joseph, the son of Tobias Allein, was born in the Devizes, in Wiltshire, in 1633, and educated at Oxford. In 1655, he became afflant to Mr Newton, in Taunton Magdalen, in Somersetshire; but was deprived for nonconformity. He died in 1668, aged 35. He was a man of great learning, and greater charity; preserving, though a nonconformist, and a severe sufferer on that account, great respect for the church, and loyalty to his sovereign. He wrote several books of piety, which are highly esteemed; but his Alarm to unconverted sinners is more famous than the rest. There have been many editions of this little pious work, the sale of which has been very great; of the edition 1672, there were 20,000 sold; of that of 1675, with this title, A sure guide to heaven, 50,000. There was also a large impression of it with its first title, in 1720.\n\nAllein, Richard, an English nonconformist divine, a native of Ditchet, in Somersetshire, was born in the year 1611. His father was rector of Ditchet, and conducted the education of his son, until he was prepared for the university. There he soon obtained the degree of master of arts, and after he entered into holy orders, first as an afflant to his father, and afterwards as rector of Batcomb, in Somersetshire, he discharged the duties of a clergyman with great industry and singular fidelity. From his education, he conceived an early predilection for the sentiments of the Puritans, and consequently, in the contest between Charles I. and the parliament, he firmly adhered to the latter. Having adopted these sentiments, he sometimes received a little disturbance from the king's forces, but he never carried his opposition to any undue length. He, along with several others, signed a paper, entitled \"The Testimony of the Ministers of Somersetshire to the truth of Christ,\" in which their declared principles and becoming candour were amply displayed. Along with his father, he was employed by the commissioners appointed by parliament for ejecting scandalous ministers; a commission which was executed with rigour, and originated in intolerance.\n\nUpon the Restoration he manifested a disposition to loyalty, but unable with a good conscience to unite in the act of conformity, he resigned his living after enjoying it for 20 years, and ranked with the meritorious band of sufferers, to the number of 2000, commonly denominated the ejected ministers. In the house of Mr More who had been a member of the parliament, he exercised the duties of his ministerial office under the penalties of that act, and was consequently reprimanded by the magistrates and imprisoned; but his piety and exemplary conduct, procured him a mitigation of punishment. But no dangers could deter him from duty; for although constrained to remove from that place in consequence of the \"five-mile act,\" he continued in the discharge of his ministerial office at Frome Selwood. Here he remained until he terminated his labours by death, in 1681.\n\nPiety, boldness, activity, and candour, shone in the character of Richard Allein. He was admired as a pathetic and practical preacher, and justly respected for the diligence with which he discharged the public and private duties of his profession. Mr Jenkins, the vicar of the parish where he resided, preached his funeral sermon, and bore an honourable testimony to his activity, moderation, and piety. Richard Allein, similar to his nonconformist brethren, closely confined his studies and publications to subjects of religion. His works are strongly marked with the peculiar features of the religious character then prevalent among the nonconformists. They have been frequently reprinted, and very much perused. His most celebrated work is \"Vindicatio Pietatis, or a Vindication of Godliness in its greatest Strictness and Spirituality, with directions for a godly life;\" this book was published in 1665, without a printer's name; and being unlicensed, the copies of it were seized and sent to the king's kitchen for wafer paper. The other productions of his pen are, \"Heaven opened, or a brief and plain discovery of the riches of God's Covenant of Grace;\" printed in 1665. \"The World Conquered;\" published in 8vo, in 1674. \"Godly Fear;\" printed in 8vo, in 1674. \"A Rebuke to Backsliders, and a Spur for Loiterers;\" printed in 8vo in 1677. \"A Companion for Prayer;\" in 12mo, 1680. \"A brief character of Mr Joseph Allein;\" and \"Instructions about heart-work, what is to be done on God's part and ours for the cure and keeping of the heart;\" a posthumous piece published in 8vo, by Dr Annelley in the year 1681. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlleluia, or Hallelujah, a word signifying, praise the Lord, to be met with either at the beginning or end of some psalms: such as psalm cxlv. and those that follow to the end. Alleluia was sung upon solemn days of rejoicing, Tobit xiii. 12. St John in the Revelation (xix. 1, 3, 4, 6.) says, that he heard a great voice of much people in heaven, who said, Alleluiah; and the four and twenty elders, and the four beasts, fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Alleluiah.\" This hymn of joy and praises was transferred from the synagogue to the church. St Jerome tells us, that at the funeral of Fabiola several psalms were sung with loud alleluias; and that the monks of Palestine were awakened at their midnight watchings, with the ringing of alleluias. So much energy has been observed in this term, that the ancient church thought proper to preserve it, without translating it either into Greek or Latin, for fear of impairing the genius and softness of it. The fourth council of Toledo has prohibited the use of it in times of Lent, or other days of fasting, and in the ceremonies of mourning: and, according to the present practice of the Roman church, this word is never repeated in Lent, nor in the obsequies of the dead; notwithstanding which, it is used in the mass for the dead, according to the Moarabic ritual, at the introit, when they sing, Tu es portio mea, Domine, Alleluia, in terra viventium, Alleluia, Alleluia. The ringing alleluia was oftentimes an invitational or call to each other to praise the Lord.\n\nAllemaengel, a small Moravian settlement on Swetara river, in Pennsylvania.\n\nAllemand, a sort of grave solemn music, with good\nALLEMANNIC, in a general sense, denotes anything belonging to the ancient Germans. Thus, we meet with Allemannic history, Allemannic language, Allemannic law, &c.\n\nALLEN, John, archbishop of Dublin in the reign of King Henry VIII. was educated in the university of Oxford; from whence removing to Cambridge, he there took the degree of bachelor of laws. He was sent by Dr Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, to the pope, about certain matters relating to the church. He continued at Rome nine years; and was created doctor of laws, either there or in some other university of Italy. After his return, he was appointed chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey, and was commissary or judge of his court as legate à latere: in the execution of which office he was suspected of great dishonesty, and even perjury. He assisted the cardinal in visiting, and afterwards suppressing, 40 of the smaller monasteries, for the erection of his college at Oxford and that at Ipswich. The cardinal procured for him the living of Dalby in Leicestershire, though it belonged to the master and brethren of the hospital of Burton-Lazars. About the latter end of the year 1525 he was incorporated doctor of laws in the university of Oxford. On the 13th of March 1528 he was consecrated archbishop of Dublin, in the room of Dr Hugh Inge deceased; and about the same time was made chancellor of Ireland. He wrote, 1. Epistolae de Pallii significatione adivsa et paffiva; penned by him at the time when he received the archiepiscopal pall. 2. De coniecturis ac flatutis in tuitoris causis obseruandis. He wrote also several other pieces relating to the church. His death, which happened in July 1534, was very tragic: for being taken in a time of rebellion by Thomas Fitzgerald, eldest son to the earl of Kildare, he was by his command most cruelly murdered, being brained like an ox, at Tartaine in Ireland, in the 58th year of his age. The place where the murder was committed was afterwards hedged in, overgrown, and unfrequented, in detestation of the fact.\n\nALLEN, Thomas, a famous mathematician of the 16th century, born at Uxeter in Staffordshire the 21st of December 1542. He was admitted scholar of Trinity college, Oxford, the 4th of June 1561; and in 1567 took his degree of master of arts. In 1570 he quitted his college and fellowship, and retired to Gloucesterhall; where he studied very closely, and became famous for his knowledge in antiquity, philosophy, and mathematics. Having received an invitation from Henry earl of Northumberland, a great friend and patron of the mathematicians, he spent some time at the earl's house, where he became acquainted with those celebrated mathematicians Thomas Harriot, John Dee, Walter Warner, and Nathaniel Torporley. Robert earl of Leicester had a particular esteem for Mr Allen, and would have conferred a bishopric upon him, but his love of solitude and retirement made him decline the offer. His great skill in the mathematics made the ignorant and vulgar look upon him as a magician or conjuror; the author of a book entitled Leicester's Common-wealth, has accordingly accused him with using the art of figuring, to procure the earl of Leicester's unlawful designs, and endeavouring by the black art to bring about a match betwixt him and Queen Elizabeth. But without pretending to point out the absurdity of the charge, it is certain that the earl placed such confidence in Allen, that nothing material in the state was transacted without his knowledge; and the earl had constant information, by letter from Mr Allen, of what passed in the university. Mr Allen was very curious and indefatigable in collecting scattered manuscripts relating to history, antiquity, astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics; these collections have been quoted by several learned authors, &c. and mentioned to have been in the Bibliotheca Allemanna. He published in Latin the second and third books of Claudius Ptolemy of Peleusium, Concerning the Judgment of the Stars, or, as it is commonly called, of the Quadrupartite Construction, with an exposition. He wrote also notes on many of Lilly's books, and some on John Bale's work De Scriptoribus M. Britanniae. Having lived to a great age, he died at Gloucester-hall on the 30th September 1632.\n\nALLENDORF, a small town in the circle of the Upper Rhine, and in the landgraviate of Hesse Cassel, remarkable for its salt works and three stone bridges. It is seated on the river Weser, 15 miles east of Cassel. E. Long. 10° 5'. N.

His natural talents, which were uncommonly vigorous, he carefully improved by an unrestrained application to study. Accordingly, his promotion was rapid. First he obtained the degree of bachelor of arts; next he was chosen moderator in philosophy; then made a canon of Christ-church, created doctor of divinity, appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and afterwards regius professor of divinity.\n\nBut in the early part of life his studies were interrupted.\nrupted, and he was called to military service by hostile occurrences of the times. In the year 1641, he, along with many other students of Oxford, entered the royal service, and gave eminent proofs of their courage and loyal attachment. A short interval of hostilities permitted them to return to their literary pursuits; but a republican party soon after disturbed their repose, and entering Oxford, attempted to plunder the colleges. Having entered the treasury, and finding nothing but fourpence and a halter, they hastened to the deanery, and seizing many valuable articles, they locked them in an apartment, intending next day to carry them along with them. During the night, however, Allestry having a key to that apartment, found means to remove the whole of the articles. Informed that he was the cause of their disappointment, they seized him; and had they not been unexpectedly called off by an order of the earl of Essex, they would have severely wrecked their indignation upon him. In October following he again took up arms, was present at the battle of Kenilworth, and on his way to Oxford to prepare for the reception of the king he was taken prisoner, but soon afterwards released by the king's forces.\n\nA violent disease which then prevailed in the garrison of Oxford, brought Allestry to the brink of the grave; but recovering, he again joined a regiment of volunteers, chiefly consisting of Oxford students. Here he served as a common soldier, and was often seen with the musket in one hand and the book in the other. When the republican party prevailed, he returned at the termination of the war to his favourite studies, but still continued true to that side of politics which he had adopted. This conduct occasioned his expulsion from the college; but he was provided with a comfortable retreat, in the families of the honourable Francis Newport, and Sir Anthony Cope.\n\nSuch was the confidence reposed in him, that, when the friends of Charles II. were secretly preparing the way for his restoration, they entrusted him with personal messages to the king. In returning from one of these interviews, he was seized at Dover, and upon examination committed a prisoner to Lambeth-house. The earl of Shaftesbury obtained his release in a few weeks. Returning to visit his friends, and among others the learned Dr Hammond, he met his corpse at the gate of his house, carrying to the grave. This deeply afflicted his mind, and added much to his present distresses. The Doctor left him his valuable library, affixing as a reason that \"he well knew that his books in his hands would be useful weapons, for the defence of that cause he had so vigorously supported.\" This valuable library along with his own, Allestry bequeathed at his death to the university.\n\nDuring his life he erected at his own private expense the west side of the outward court of Eton college, the grammar school in Christ-church college, and settled several liberal pensions upon individual persons and families. His original biographer gives him the following character. \"Memory, fancy, judgment, elocution, great modesty, and no less assurance, a comprehension of things, and a fluency of words; an aptness for the pleasant, and sufficiency for the rugged parts of knowledge; a courage to encounter and an industry to master all things, make up the character of his happy genius. There was not in the world a man of clearer honesty and courage; no temptation could bribe him to do a base thing, or terror affright him from the doing a good one. This made his friendship as lasting and inviolable as his life, without the mean considerations of profit, or flattery of craft; without the pageantry of ceremonious addresses, the cold civility of form, and the servile fawning and obsequious flattery of others.\" He left a volume of sermons printed at Oxford in 1684, from the perusal of which posterity may judge of his literary abilities. Although his lectures gave universal satisfaction, yet he prohibited their publication.\n\nALLESTRY, Jacob, an English poet of the last century. He was the son of James Allestry, a bookeller of London who was ruined by the great fire in 1666. Jacob was educated at Westminster School, entered at Christ-church, Oxford, in the a.d. term 1671, at the age of 18, and was elected student in 1672. He took the degree of arts; was music reader in 1679, and terne filius in 1681; both which offices he executed with great applause, being esteemed a good philologist and poet. He had a chief hand in the verses and pastorals spoken in the theatre at Oxford May 21, 1681, by Mr William Saville second son of the marquis of Halifax, and George Cholmondeley second son of Robert Viscount Kells (both of Christ-church), before James duke of York, his duchess, and the lady Anne; which verses and pastorals, were afterwards printed in the \"Examen Poeticum.\" He died October 15, 1686, and was buried in St Thomas's churchyard.\n\nALLEVEURE, a small brass Swedish coin, worth about ½d.

From Eton school, in the year 1528, he removed to King's college, Cambridge, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts. He also studied some time at Oxford; afterwards he married, was presented to a living, and became a zealous reformer. Upon Queen Mary's accession he left his cure and retired into the north of England; where he maintained his wife and himself by teaching a school, and practising physic. Queen Elizabeth ascending the throne, he went to London, where he acquired great reputation by reading the divinity lecture at St Paul's, and in July 1560 was consecrated bishop of Exeter. He was created doctor of divinity at Oxford in November 1561. He died on the 15th of April 1570, and was buried at Exeter in the cathedral. He wrote, 1. The Poor Man's Library, 2 vols. fol. Lond. 1571. These volumes contain twelve lectures on the first epistle of St Peter, read at St Paul's. 2. A Hebrew Grammar. Whether it was ever published is uncertain. He translated the Pentateuch, in the version of the Bible which was undertaken by Queen Elizabeth's command.\n\nALLEY, in Gardening, a straight parallel walk, bounded on both sides with trees, shrubs, &c., and usually covered with gravel or turf.\n\nALLEY, among Builders, denotes a narrow passage leading from one place to another.\n\nALLEY, in Perspective, that which, in order to have\na greater appearance of length, is made wider at the entrance than at the termination.\n\nALLEYN, in the New Husbandry, implies the vacant space between the outermost row of corn on one bed and the nearest row to it on the next parallel bed; and it is usually about four feet in breadth, exclusive of the partitions between the rows of corn in the beds. The first hoeing of wheat is performed in the beginning of winter, and the earth is ploughed away from the rows into the intervals, which forms small ridges in the middle between the double rows. The second hoeing is in the spring, which turns it back to the rows, leaving a furrow in the middle of the alley. The third hoeing is from the rows, after the wheat has bloomed: this turns the earth into the intervals, forming small ridges there, as at the first hoeing. The fourth hoeing returns the earth to the ridges, which is performed a month or more after the third hoeing. This commonly finishes the horse-hoeings, if the land is in good heart; otherwise one or two more hoeings are necessary.\n\nALLEYN, Edward, a celebrated English actor in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, and founder of the college at Dulwich in Surrey, was born at London in the parish of St Botolph, Sept. 1, 1566, as appears from a memorandum of his own writing. Dr Fuller says, that he was bred a stage-player; and that his father would have given him a liberal education, but that he was not turned for a ferious course of life. He was, however, a youth of an excellent capacity, a cheerful temper, a tenacious memory, a sweet elocution, and in his person of a stately port and aspect: all which advantages might well induce a young man to take to the theatrical profession. By several authorities we find he must have been on the stage some time before 1592; for at this time he was in high favour with the town, and greatly applauded by the best judges, particularly by Ben Jonson.\n\nHaywood, in his prologue to Marlowe's Jew of Malta, calls him Proteus for shapes, and Roscius for a tongue. He usually played the capital parts, and was one of the original actors in Shakespear's plays; in some of Ben Jonson's he was also a principal performer: but what characters he personated in either of these poets, it is difficult now to determine. This is owing to the inaccuracy of their editors, who did not print the names of the players opposite to the characters they performed, as the modern custom is; but gave one general list of actors to the whole set of plays, as in the old folio edition of Shakespear; or divided one from the other, setting the dramatic personae before the plays, and the catalogue of performers after them, as in Jonson's.\n\nIt may appear surprising how one of Mr Alleyn's profession should be enabled to erect such an edifice as Dulwich college, and liberally endow it for the maintenance of so many persons. But it must be observed that he had some paternal fortune, which, though small, might lay a foundation for his future affluence; and it is to be presumed, that the profits he received from acting, to one of his provident and managing disposition, and one who by his excellence in playing drew after him such crowds of spectators, must have considerably improved his fortune: besides he was not only an actor, but master of a playhouse built at his own expense, by which he is said to have amassed considerable wealth. He was also keeper of the king's wild beasts, or master of the royal bear-garden, which was frequented by vast crowds of spectators; and the profits arising from these sports are said to have amounted to £500 per annum. He was thrice married; and the portions of his two first wives, they leaving him no issue to inherit, might probably contribute to this benefaction. Such kind of donations have been frequently thought to proceed more from vanity and ostentation than real piety; but this of Mr Alleyn has been ascribed to a very singular cause, for the devil has been said to be the first promoter of it. Mr Aubrey mentions a tradition, \"that Mr Alleyn playing a demon, with six others, in one of Shakespear's plays, was, in the midst of the play, surprised by an apparition of the devil; which so worked on his fancy, that he made a vow, which he performed by building Dulwich college.\" He began the foundation of this college, under the direction of Inigo Jones, in 1614; and the buildings, gardens, &c. were finished in 1617, in which he is said to have expended about £10,000.\n\nAfter the college was built, he met with some difficulty in obtaining a charter for settling his lands in mortmain: for he proposed to endow it with £800 per annum, for the maintenance of one master, one warden, and four fellows, three whereof were to be clergymen and the fourth a skillful organist; also five poor men and as many women, besides twelve poor boys to be educated till the age of fourteen or fifteen, and then put out to some trade or calling. The obstruction he met with arose from the lord chancellor Bacon, who wished King James to settle part of those lands for the support of two academical lectures; and he wrote a letter to the marquis of Buckingham, dated August 18, 1618, entreating him to use his interest with his majesty for that purpose. Mr Alleyn's solicitation was however at last complied with, and he obtained the royal license, giving him full power to lay his foundation, by his majesty's letter patent, bearing date the 21st of June 1619; by virtue whereof he did, in the chapel of the said new hospital at Dulwich, called The College of God's Gift, on the 13th of September following, publicly read and publish a quattuorpartite writing in parchment, whereby he created and established the said college; he then subscribed it with his name, and fixed his seal to several parts thereof, in presence of several honourable persons, and ordered copies of the writings to four different parishes. He was himself the first master of his college; so that to make use of the words of Mr Haywood, one of his contemporaries, \"He was so mingled with humility and charity, that he became his own penitent, humbly submitting himself to that proportion of diet and clothes which he had bestowed on others.\" We have no reason to think he ever repented of this distribution of his substance; but on the contrary, that he was entirely satisfied, as appears from the following memorial in his own writing, found amongst his papers: \"May 26, 1620.—My wife and I acknowledged the fine at the common pleas bar, of all our lands to the college: blest be God that he has given us life to do it.\" His wife died in the year 1623; and about two years afterwards he married Constance Kinchtoe, who survived him, and received remarkable...\nremarkable proofs of his affection, if at least we may judge of it by his will, wherein he left her considerably. He died Nov. 25, 1626, in the 61st year of his age, and was buried in the chapel of his new college, where there is a tombstone over his grave, with an inscription. His original Diary is also there preserved.\n\nThe subjoined anecdote is entertaining in itself, and shows the high esteem in which Mr Alleyn was held as an actor: \"Edward Alleyn, the Garrick of Shakespeare's time, had been on the most friendly footing with our poet, as well as Ben Jonson. They used frequently to spend their evenings together at the sign of the Globe, somewhere near Black Friars, where the playhouse then was. The world need not be told, that the convivial hours of such a triumvirate must be pleasing as well as profitable, and may truly be said to be such pleasures as might bear the reflections of the morning. In consequence of one of these meetings, the following letter was written by G. Peele, a fellow of Christ-church college, Oxford, and a dramatic poet, who belonged to the Club, to one Marle, an intimate of his:\n\n'Friend Marle,\n\n'I must desire that my sister may watch, and the cookery book you promised, may be sent by the man.—I never longed for thy company more than last night: we were all very merry at the Globe, when Ned Alleyn did not scruple to affirm pleasantly to thy Friend Will, that he had stolen his speech about the Qualities of an actor's excellency in Hamlet his Tragedy, from conversations many-fold which had passed between them, and opinions given by Alleyn touching the subject.—Shakespeare did not take this talk in good part; but Jonson put an end to the strife with witty remarks: This affair needeth no Contention; you stole it from Ned, no doubt; do not marvel: Have you not seen him at times out of number?—Believe me most sincerely, yours, G. Peele.'\n\nALLIA, a river of Italy, in the Sabine territory, which running down a very steep channel from the mountains of Crufumium, mixes with the Tiber 40 miles from Rome; famous for the great slaughter of the Romans by the Gauls, under Brennus, when 40,000 Romans were killed or put to flight; hence Allia dies, an unlucky day, (Virgil, Ovid, Lucan.) Our ancestors, says Cicero, deemed the day of the fight of Allia more fatal than that of taking the city.\n\nALLIANCE, in the Civil and Canon Law, the relation contracted between two persons or two families by marriage.\n\nAlliance is also used for a treaty entered into by sovereign princes and states, for their mutual safety and defence.—In this sense, alliances may be distinguished into such as are offensive, whereby the contracting parties oblige themselves jointly to attack some other power; and into defensive ones, whereby they bind themselves to stand by and defend each other in case they are attacked by others. Alliance with the ancient Romans, though a sort of servitude, was much coveted. Ariarathes, we are told by Polybius, offered a sacrifice to the gods by way of thanksgiving for having obtained this alliance. The reason was, that thenceforward people were sure not to receive any injuries except from them. There were different sorts of allies: some only united to them by a participation of the privileges of Romans, as the Latins and Hernici; others by their very foundation, as the colonies; others by the benefactions they received from them, as Massilia, Lutetiae, and Attalia, who owed their kingdoms to Rome; others by free treaties, which last by a long alliance became subjects, as the kings of Bithynia, Cappadocia, Egypt, and most of the cities of Greece: Lastly, Others by compulsive treaties, and the law of subjection, as Philip and Antiochus. For they never granted peace to an enemy, without making an alliance with him; that is, they never subdued any people without using it as a means of subduing others.\n\nThe forms or ceremonies of alliances have been various in different ages and countries. Among us, signing and swearing, sometimes at the altar, are the chief; anciently eating and drinking together, chiefly offering sacrifices together, were the customary rite of ratifying an alliance. Among the Jews and Chaldeans, heifers or calves; among the Greeks, bulls or goats; and among the Romans, hogs were sacrificed on this occasion. Among the ancient Arabs, alliances were confirmed by drawing blood out of the palms of the hands of the two contracting princes with a sharp stone, dipping therein a piece of their garments, and therewith smearing seven stones, at the same time invoking the gods Vrotalt and Alilat, i.e., according to Herodotus, Bacchus and Urania. Among the people of Colchis, the confirmation of alliances is said to be effected by one of the princes offering his wife's breasts to the other to suck, which he was obliged to do till there issued blood.\n\nALLIANCE, in a figurative sense, is applied to any kind of union or connexion; thus we say, there is an alliance between the church and state.\n\nALLIARIA. See Erysimum, Botany Index.\n\nALLIER, in Geography, a river of France, which gives name to a department, has its source near Chauteau Neuf de Randon, in the department of Lozere, and joins the Loire near Nevers.\n\nALLIER, a department of France, formerly the province of Bourbonnois, is bounded on the north by the departments of Saone and Loire, Nievre and Cher; on the east by those of Saone and Loire and the Loire; on the south by those of the Loire, Puy de Dome, and Creuse; and on the west by those of Creuse and Cher. It contains 1,454,341 square acres; the number of inhabitants is about 266,105; and it is divided into four communal districts. The principal town is Moulins.\n\nALLIGATI, in Roman Antiquity, the basest kind of slaves, who were usually kept fettered. The Romans had three degrees, or orders, of slaves or servants; the first employed in the management of their estates; the second in the menial or lower functions of the family; the third called alligati, above mentioned.\n\nALLIGATION, the name of a method of solving all questions that relate to the mixture of one ingredient with another. Though writers on arithmetic generally make alligation a branch of that science; yet, as it is plainly nothing more than an application of the common properties of numbers, in order to solve a few questions\nAlligation questions that occur in particular branches of business, we choose rather to keep it distinct from the science of arithmetic.\n\nAlligation is generally divided into medial and alternate.\n\n**Alligation Medial**, from the rates and quantities of the simples given, discovers the rate of the mixture.\n\n**Rule.** As the total quantity of the simples,\nTo their price or value;\nSo any quantity of the mixture,\nTo the rate.\n\n**Examp.** A grocer mixeth 3cbl. of currants, at 4d. per lb. with 10lb. of other currants, at 6d. per lb.: What is the value of 1lb. of the mixture? **Ans.** 4½d.\n\n| lb. | d. |\n|-----|----|\n| 30  | 4  |\n| 10  | 6  |\n\nNote 1. When the quantity of each simple is the same, the rate of the mixture is readily found by adding the rates of the simples, and dividing their sum by the number of simples. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes several sorts of sugar, and of each an equal quantity; viz. at 5gs. at 54s. and at 60s. per cwt. the rate of the mixture will be 54s. 8d. per cwt.; for\n\n\\[ \\frac{50 + 54 + 60}{3} = 54.8 \\]\n\nNote 2. If it be required to increase or diminish the quantity of the mixture, say, As the sum of the given quantities of the simples, to the several quantities given; so the quantity of the mixture proposed, to the quantities of the simples sought.\n\nNote 3. If it be required to know how much of each simple is an assigned portion of the mixture, say, As the quantity of the mixture, to the several quantities of the simples given; so the quantity of the assigned portion, to the quantities of the simples sought.\n\nThus,\n\nSuppose a grocer mixes 10lb. of raisins with 30lb. of almonds and 40lb. of currants, and it be demanded how many ounces of each sort are found in every pound or in every 16 ounces of the mixture, say,\n\n| oz. | 80 : 10 :: 16 : 2 raisins. |\n|-----|--------------------------|\n|     | 80 : 30 :: 16 : 6 almonds. |\n|     | 80 : 40 :: 16 : 8 currants. |\n\nProof 16\n\nNote 4. If the rates of two simples, with the total value and total quantity of the mixture, be given, the quantity of each simple may be found as follows: viz. Multiply the lesser rate into the total quantity, subtract the product from the total value, and the remainder will be equal to the product of the excess of the higher rate above the lower, multiplied into the quantity of the higher-priced simple; and consequently the said remainder, divided by the difference of the rates, Alligation, will quote the said quantity. Thus,\n\nSuppose a grocer has a mixture of 400lb. weight, that cost him 7l. 10s. confiting of raisins at 4d. per lb. and almonds at 6d. how many pounds of almonds were in the mixture?\n\n| lb. | Rates. |\n|-----|-------|\n| 400 | 6d.   |\n| 7  | 10 = 1800 |\n| 1600 | 1600d. |\n\n2)200(100lb. of almonds at 6d. is 2 10\nAnd 300lb. of raisins at 4d. is 5 0\n\nTotal 400 Proof 7 10\n\n**Alligation Alternate**, being the converse of alligation medial, from the rates of the simples, and rate of the mixture given, finds the quantities of the simples.\n\n**Rules.** I. Place the rate of the mixture on the left side of a brace, as the root; and on the right side of the brace set the rates of the several simples, under one another, as the branches. II. Link or alligate the branches, so as one greater and another less than the root may be linked or yoked together. III. Set the difference betwixt the root and the several branches right against their respective yoke-fellows. These alternate differences are the quantities required. Note 1. If any branch happen to have two or more yoke-fellows, the difference betwixt the root and these yoke-fellows must be placed right against the said branch, one after another, and added into one sum. 2. In some questions, the branches may be alligated more ways than one: and a question will always admit of so many answers as there are different ways of linking the branches.\n\nAlligation alternate admits of three varieties, viz. 1. The question may be unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples and that of the mixture. 2. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples. 3. The question may be limited to a certain quantity of the mixture.\n\n**Variety I.** When the question is unlimited, with respect both to the quantity of the simples, and that of the mixture, this is called **Alligation Simple**.\n\n**Examp.** A grocer would mix sugars at 5d. 7d. and 10d. per lb. so as to sell the mixture or compound at 8d. per lb.: What quantity of each must he take?\n\n| Ib. |\n|-----|\n| 8  |\n| 7  |\n| 10 |\n\nHere the rate of the mixture 8 is placed on the left side of the brace, as the root; and on the right side of the same brace are set the rates of the several simples, viz. 5, 7, 10, under one another, as the branches; according to Rule I.\n\nThe branch 10 being greater than the root, is alligated or linked with 7 and 5, both these being less than the root; as directed in Rule II.\n\nThe difference between the root 8 and the branch 5, viz. 3, is set right against this branch's yoke-fellow 10.\n\nThe difference between 8 and 7 is likewise set right against\nAlligation against the yoke-fellow 10. And the difference betwixt 8 and 10 viz. 2, is set right against the two yoke-fellows 7 and 5; as prescribed by Rule III.\n\nAs the branch 10 has two differences on the right, viz. 3 and 1, they are added; and the answer to the question is, that 2lb. at 5d., 2lb. at 7d. and 4lb. at 10d. will make the mixture required.\n\nThe truth and reason of the rules will appear by considering, that whatever is lost upon any one branch is gained upon its yoke-fellow. Thus in the above example by selling 4lb. of 10d. sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 8d. lost; but the like sum is gained upon its two yoke-fellows; for by selling 2lb. of 3d. sugar at 8d. per lb. there is 6d. gained; and by selling 2lb. of 7d. sugar at 8d. there is 2d. gained; and 6d. and 2d. make 8d.\n\nHence it follows, that the rate of the mixture must always be mean or middle with respect to the rates of the simples; that is, it must be less than the greatest, and greater than the least; otherwise a solution would be impossible. And the price of the total quantity mixed, computed at the rate of the mixture, will always be equal to the sum of the prices of the several quantities cast up at the respective rates of the simple.\n\nVariety II. When the question is limited to a certain quantity of one or more of the simples, this is called Alligation Partial.\n\nIf the quantity of one the simples only be limited, alligate the branches, and take their differences, as if there had been no such limitation; and then work by the following proportion:\n\nAs the difference right against the rate of the simple, whose quantity is given,\nTo the other differences respectively;\nSo the quantity given,\nTo the several quantities sought.\n\nExample. A distiller would, with 40 gallons of brandy at 12s. per gallon, mix rum at 7s. per gallon, and gin at 4s. per gallon: How much of the rum and gin must he take, to sell the mixture at 8s. per gallon?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Gal.} & \\\\\n8 & \\quad 12 & \\quad 14 & \\quad 5 & \\quad 40 \\text{ of brandy.} \\\\\n7 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 32 \\text{ of rum.} \\\\\n4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 4 & \\quad 32 \\text{ of gin.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe operation gives for answer, 5 gallons of brandy, 4 of rum, and 4 of gin. But the question limits the quantity of brandy to 40 gallons; therefore say,\n\nIf \\(5 : 4 :: 40 : 32\\)\n\nThe quantity of gin, by the operation, being also 4, the proportion needs not be repeated.\n\nVariety III. When the question is limited to a certain quantity of the mixture, this is called Alligation Total.\n\nAfter linking the branches, and taking the differences, work by the proportion following:\n\nAs the sum of the differences,\nTo each particular difference;\nSo the given total of the mixture,\nTo the respective quantities required.\n\nExample. A vintner hath wine at 3s. per gallon, and would mix it with water, so as to make a composition of 144 gallons, worth 2s. 6d. per gallon: How much wine, and how much water, must he take?\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Gal.} & \\\\\n30 & \\quad 36 & \\quad 30 & \\quad 120 \\text{ of wine.} \\\\\n& \\quad 6 & \\quad 24 \\text{ of water.} \\\\\n36 & \\quad 144 \\text{ total.} \\\\\n120 \\times 36 = 4320 \\\\\n24 \\times 6 = 0\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nProof \\(144)4320(30\\)\n\nAs \\(36 : 30 :: 144 : 120\\)\nAs \\(36 : 6 :: 144 : 24\\).\n\nThere being here only two simples, and the total of the mixture limited, the question admits but of one answer.\n\nALLIGATOR, in Zoology, a synonyme of the lacerta crocodilus. See Lacerta.\n\nALLIGATOR Pear. See Lauris, Botany Index.\n\nALLIONIA. See Botany Index.\n\nALLIOTH, a star in the tail of the Greater Bear, much used for finding the latitude at sea.\n\nALLITERATION, an ornament of language chiefly used in poetry, and consisting in the repetition of the same letter at certain intervals. We do not remember to have ever seen any satisfactory account of alliteration in the writings of the critics. They seem to have passed it over in contemptuous silence; either as a false refinement or as a mere trifle. It perhaps deserves a better fate. Many chapters have been composed on quantity, on the expression resulting from different arrangements of long and short syllables, and on the powers of pauses as they are variously placed, without a word of alliteration. This is the more extraordinary, as one should think it impossible for any man to examine minutely, and, as it were, dissect a number of verses, without perceiving the vast abundance of this ornament. It is as if an anatomist should publish a complete table of the arteries in the human body, and affect never to have seen a vein or a nerve: for it may be affirmed, with small danger of mistake, that if you examine any number of verses, remarkable either for sweetness or for energy, they will be found in some degree alliterative. We do not pretend to say, that the sweetness and energy of versification depends chiefly on this circumstance, yet we cannot help believing that it may claim some share: for it is a constant appearance, as far as we have ever observed, that the poets whose fame is highest for versification, have been attentive to alliteration.\n\nThe very trifling appearance of the ornament itself, upon a superficial view, and the frequent abuse of it, are circumstances indeed which give no encouragement to a serious inquiry into its nature and operation. How common is it for writers, who affect to be comic, when in want of other means for raising a smile, to use affected alliteration with success? But, in the fine arts, no beauty or grace is beyond the power of ridicule. The noblest attitudes in painting have been rendered laughable by caricature. St Paul preaching at Athens, in the design of Raphael, appears elegant, noble, and in some degree awful. The same apostle, represented by Hogarth, in nearly the same attitude, pleading before\nfore the governor Felix, seems altogether ridiculous.\n\nSo the language and versification of Milton in the Paradise Lost appear only proper for the most elevated subjects. In the Splendid Shilling of Philips, they appear equally proper for the lowest. So fares it also with alliteration. Nor ought we to be mortified at the discovery, that much of the delight afforded by versification arises from a cause so pitiful as the repetition of the same letter twice, or oftener, on the accented parts of a verse; for there are many other causes of pleasure, which, when thus detected and taken to pieces, seem equally contemptible.\n\nWe apprehend the principal operation of this ornament to be quite mechanical. It is easier for the organs of speech to resume, at short intervals, one certain conformation, than to throw themselves into a number of different ones, unconnected and discordant. For example, a succession of labials, interperated at regular distances with dentals and gutturals, will be more easily pronounced than the succession of all the three at random. Sounds of which the articulation is easiest, are most completely in the power of the speaker. He can pronounce them slowly or rapidly, softly or with force, at pleasure. In this we imagine the power and advantage of alliteration are founded; for we would not lay any stress on the pleasure which can result to the ear from the repetition of the same letter. It has been compared to the frequent returns of the key-note in a musical strain; but that analogy is extremely faint. The ear, we presume, can be pleased with alliteration only in so far as it contributes to the superior easiness of recitation; for what is recited with ease must be heard with pleasure.\n\nThese remarks might be confirmed and illustrated by numberless passages from the best poets. Some few lines will suffice, taken from Gray, who seems to have paid particular attention to this grace. He professed to have learned his versification from Dryden, as Dryden did from Spenner; and these three abound in alliteration above all the English poets. We choose Gray for another reason, in proof of what we mentioned before, that alliteration contributes not only to the sweetness, but also to the energy, of versification; for he uses it chiefly when he aims at strength and boldness. In the Silver Odes (as Dr Johnson styles them), almost every strophe commences and concludes with an alliterative line. The poet, we suppose, wished to begin with force, and end with dignity.\n\n\"Ruin seize thee, ruthless king.\"\n\"To high-born Hoel's harp, or soft Llewelyn's lay.\"\n\"Weave the warp, and weave the woof.\"\n\"Stamp we our vengeance deep, and ratify his doom.\"\n\"Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind's sway.\"\n\"That hush'd in grim repose, expects his ev'ning prey.\"\n\nIt must be observed here, that we hold a verse alliterative which has a letter repeated on its accented parts, although those parts do not begin words; the repeated letter bearing a strong analogy to the bars in a musical phrase. Gray seems to have had a particular liking to these sort of balanced verses, which divide equally, and of which the opposite sides have an alliterative resemblance.\n\n\"Eyes that glow, and fangs that grin.\"\n\"Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.\"\n\"Hauberk crash, and helmet ring.\"\n\nAll these lines appear to us to have a force and energy, arising from alliteration, which renders them easy to be recited; or, if the reader pleases, mumbled. For the same reason the following passage appears sad and solemn, by the repetition of the labial liquid.\n\n\"Mountains, ye mourn in vain,\"\n\"Mordred, whose magic song,\"—&c.\n\nIf alliteration thus contributes to enforce the expression of a poetical sentiment, its advantages in poetry must be considerable. It is not, therefore, unworthy a poet's regard in the act of composition. If two words offer of equal propriety, the one alliterative, the other not, we think the first ought to be chosen. We would compare this to the practice of fuguing in music. A composer who aims at expression will not hunt after fugues; but if they offer, if they seem to arise spontaneously from the subject, he will not reject them. So a good poet ought not to select an epithet merely for beginning with a certain letter, unless it suit his purpose well in every other respect; for the beauty of alliteration, when happy, is not greater than its deformity when affected. A couplet from Pope will exemplify both; the first line being bad, and the second good:\n\n\"Eternal beauties grace the shining scene,\nFields ever fresh, and groves for ever green.\"\n\nALLIUM (from ἀλλεῖν, \"to avoid or shun,\" because many shun the smell of it), GARLIC. See BOTANY Index.\n\nALLIX, PETER, a French Protestant divine, was born at Alençon in France, in the year 1641. He became a learned divine of the English church, and a strenuous defender of the Protestant faith. At the time when the edict of Nantes tolerated and protected the Protestants of France, he entered upon his clerical profession, and remained minister of Rouen until the thirty-fifth year of his age. In this period he wrote several pieces upon the controversy between the Papists and the Protestants, which obtained him great fame among his own party. He removed to Charenton in the vicinity of Paris, which was the principal church among the reformed, and frequented by persons of the first rank in France, who professed the Protestant faith. Here Allix preached a course of excellent sermons in defence of the Protestant religion, some of which were afterwards printed in Holland, and added to his increasing fame. The chief object of these sermons was to repel the attack of the bishop of Meaux, the most ingenious and able opponent of the Reformation at that time. The unwise revocation of the edict of Nantes drove Allix and many others to seek refuge in England. Three years after his arrival in England, he had made himself so perfectly master of the English language as to be able to write very correctly a \"Defence of the Christian Religion.\" This work he dedicated to James II., in testimony of gratitude for his kind reception of the distressed refugees of France. In justice to the memory of James,\nand as a specimen of the talents of Allix, it may be proper to give an extract from this curious dedication.\n\n\"As your majesty continues still to give such illustrious instances of your clemency and royal protection to those of your nation; so I confess, Sir, I thought myself under an obligation to lay hold upon this opportunity of publishing what all those who find so sure a protection in your majesty's dominions feel and think as much as myself upon these new testimonies of your royal bounty. When your majesty had taken us into your particular care, and had granted us several privileges, and so made us sharers in all the advantages which those who live under your government enjoy; your majesty did yet something more, and inspired all your subjects with the same compassion towards us, with which your royal breast was already touched. You saw our miseries, and resolved to give us ease; and this generous design was executed, and your royal clemency diffused in the hearts of all your subjects. The whole world, Sir, which has received upon all its coasts some remainders of our shipwreck, is filled with admiration of the unexampled effects of your majesty's clemency. I could wish, Sir, that this work which I now present to your majesty might be so happy as to pass to posterity with this character of our acknowledgment, and that it might stand as a faithful record for ever to perpetuate the memory of that lively sense of your bounty which is imprinted on all our hearts.\"\n\nNot long after his arrival in England, he was honoured with the title of doctor of divinity, and also received the more substantial honour of being appointed treasurer of the church of Salisbury. Allix still maintained the station of a champion for the Protestant cause, and in opposition to the bishop of Meaux, proved that the charge of heresy justly belonged to the Papists, and not to their opponents, because they had introduced new doctrines into the church.\n\nAfter having with much industry and learning exercised his talents in defence of Protestantism, he employed his pen to support the doctrine of the Trinity against the Unitarians, who contended that the idea of Christ's divinity could be traced up no higher than the time of Justin Martyr. With a great display of erudition, he attempted to prove that the Trinitarian doctrine was believed by the Jewish church. But the reputation which he had acquired for learning and ability was somewhat diminished by the ridicule which he brought upon himself in attempting to fix the precise time of Christ's second coming to the year 1720, or at the very latest, to the year 1736. He died at London in the year 1717, after his studious life had been protracted to the length of 76 years. He left behind him numerous proofs of his great talents, extensive learning, uncommon industry, and zealous attachment to the doctrines of the church of England. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALLOA, or Alloway, a sea-port town in Scotland, seated on the Forth, about 20 miles higher up the river than Leith, and five miles east of Stirling. It is a populous place; has two market days in the week; and is remarkable for its fine castle, the seat of Mr Erskine of Mar, and for the coal mines near it. The harbour is extremely commodious, with great depth of water; and vessels are expeditiously loaded with coals from the pits by an uncommon waggon-way, on which one horse draws with ease three waggons at once, each waggon containing a ton and a half. An excellent dry dock has also lately been erected here, capable of receiving ships of the greatest burden. There is likewise a large glas-house for blowing bottles, of which vessels are supplied with any quantity upon the shortest notice.\n\nThe tower and lands of Alloa were exchanged by David II, king of Scots, anno 1365, with Thomas Lord Erskine, for the lands and estate of Strathgarnet in Perthshire; and since that time the castle of Alloa has been the favourite residence of the family of Mar. The situation is uncommonly beautiful. The gardens here were the first that were laid out on a great scale in Scotland; and, with the advice of Le Naute, were indebted to the taste of John the late earl of Mar, who began to plant them in the year 1706. They contain about forty acres, in which there is some very fine timber, near a century old.\n\nThe tower of Alloa is 89 feet in height, with walls of 11 feet in thickness; and was built in the end of the 13th century. In this residence of the family of Erskine many of the Scottish princes received their education, having been for more than two centuries, the wards of the Lords Erskine and Earls of Mar; who held generally the castle of Stirling, and frequently the three principal fortresses of the kingdom, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dumbarton. The last heir of the Scottish monarchy who was nurtured there was Henry prince of Wales; whose cradle, golf-clubs, and other infantine and youthful remains, are preserved by the heir of the earls of Mar, in remembrance of that spirited and promising prince; of whom Dr Birch has preserved several anecdotes, connected with the Erskines and his residence at Alloa. Among other remains of antiquity preserved at Alloa, in remembrance of the confidence and affection which subsisted always betwixt the Stuarts and the Erskines, is the private signet of the unfortunate Mary, which she gave to the regent Mar, after she was obliged by the treaty of Edinburgh to desist from wearing the arms of England in the first quarter; the child's chair of James VI, her son; and the effigy chair of Thomas Lord Erskine the second earl of Mar of the name, with the fashionable grace carved on it, Soli Deo Honor et Gloria.\n\nALLOBROGES (Inscriptions, Livy, Velleius, Florus); from Allobroges (Horace): a people of Gallia Narbonensis, situated between the rivers Ilara and Rhodanus, and the Lacus Lemanus; commanded by Cicerro for their fidelity; but reproached by Horace on account of their fondness for novelty.\n\nNovisque rebus infidelis Allobroges.

The alloy of gold is estimated by carats, that of silver by pennyweights. In different nations different proportions of alloy are used; whence their moneys are said to be of different degrees of fineness or baseness, and are valued accordingly in foreign exchanges. The chief reasons alleged for the alloying of coin are: 1. The mixture of the metals, which, when melted from the mine, are not perfectly pure. 2. The saving the expense it must otherwise cost if they were to be refined. 3. The necessity of rendering them harder, by mixing some parts of other metals with them, to prevent the diminution of weight by wearing in passing from hand to hand. 4. The melting of foreign gold or coin which is alloyed. 5. The charges of coinage, which must be made good by the profit arising from the money coined. 6. Lastly, the duty belonging to the sovereign, on account of the power he has to cause money to be coined in his dominions.\n\nIn a more general sense, the word is employed in chemistry to signify the union of different metallic matters.—As an infinity of different combinations may be made according to the nature, the number, and the proportions of the metallic matters capable of being alloyed, we shall not here enter into the detail of the particular alloys, all which are not yet nearly known.

It is the Sil Atticum of the ancients; it ferments very violently with acid menstruums; by which single quality, it is sufficiently distinguished from the Sil Syricum, to which it has in many respects a great affinity. It is found in immense quantities in many parts of Spain; and in Andalusia there are in a manner whole mountains of it. It is used in painting, and in medicine as an astringent.\n\nALMAGRO, a fortress of Spain, the capital of one of the districts of La Mancha. It was built by the archbishop Roderic of Toledo, who finished it in 1214, and put a considerable garrison into it to restrain the incursions of the Moors. This was hardly done, when the fortress was besieged by an army of 5000 horse and foot, under the command of a Moorish officer of great reputation; but the prelate, its founder, took care to supply those within with such plenty of necessaries, that at length the enemy found themselves obliged to raise the siege and retire with great loss.\n\nAlmagro, Diego De, a Spanish commander, was...\nof such obscure birth and mean parentage, that he derived his name from the village where he was born, in 1463. Deprived of the means of early instruction, he could neither read nor write, but nevertheless, in consequence of his improvements in the military art, he formed an afflication with Pizarro and de Luque, for the purpose of discoveries and conquest upon the Peruvian coast. The governor of Panama having sanctioned their enterprise, they devoted their united exertions to that undertaking. Pizarro directed the conquest, and Almagro was appointed to conduct the supplies, provisions, and reinforcements. In the two first unsuccessful attempts, he performed this office with persevering fidelity and uncommon activity. His perseverance was followed with complete success; for they at last discovered the coast of Peru, and landed at Tumbez, distinguished by its temple and palace of the incas or sovereigns, and situated about three degrees south of the line. Pizarro was sent over to Spain to solicit farther powers, after the three adventurers had previously adjusted their future preferences, and agreed that Pizarro should be governor, Almagro lieutenant-governor, and Luque bishop. In this negociation, Pizarro obtained the clerical dignity for Luque; but chiefly concerned about his own interest, he neglected the preference of Almagro. On his return, Almagro was so enraged, that he refused to act with such a perfidious companion, and resolved to form a new association. Pizarro, for the present artfully endeavoured to avert the indignation of Almagro, and gradually soothed the rage and disappointment of the folder. The union was renewed upon the former terms; and it was solemnly stipulated that a common expense and a common advantage should take place.\n\nIn February 1531, leaving Almagro at Panama, to supply provisions and reinforcements, Pizarro set sail for Peru. He attacked a principal settlement of the natives, in the province of Coaque, obtained immense spoil, and made such ample remittances to Almagro, as enabled him to complete his reinforcement, and in the close of the year 1532, he arrived at St Michael with a body of men, which nearly doubled the number of those which Pizarro had along with him. The Spaniards about this time took captive the unfortunate Inca Atahualpa; and after they had received an immense sum for his ransom, they barbarously put him to death. Pizarro sailed for Spain with the news of their success, and with remittances to a great amount; and consequently Almagro gained that elevated station he so long and eagerly desired. But no sooner had Almagro received the intelligence of his promotion by the royal grant, than he attempted to seize Cuzco, the imperial residence of the incas, under pretence that it lay within his defined territory. This produced a new quarrel; but peace was restored upon the determination of Almagro to attempt the conquest of Chili, and likewise to have part of the territory of Peru.\n\nIn 1535, he accordingly set out at the head of 570 Europeans, and in crossing the mountains, he suffered great hardships and losses by mistaking the route, but at length he descended into the plains of that devoted region. Here he met with a more vigorous resistance from the natives than the Spaniards had ever experienced in other countries. He had, however, made some progress, when he was recalled to Peru by the news of the natives having risen in great numbers, and attacked Lima and Cuzco. He purified a new route, and marching through the sandy plains on the coast, he suffered by heat and drought calamities not inferior to those which he had endured from cold and famine on the summit of the Andes. Arriving at a favourable moment, he resolved to hold the place both against the Indians and his Spanish rivals. He attacked the Peruvian army with great vigour, and making a great slaughter, he proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without any farther interruption. The open, affable, and generous temper of Almagro, gained over to his side many of the adherents of the Pizzaros, who were disgusted with their harsh and opprobrious conduct. With their aid, he advanced towards the city by night, surprized the sentinels, and surrounded the house where the two brothers resided, who were compelled, after an obstinate defence, to surrender at discretion. A form of government was settled in the name of Almagro, and his jurisdiction over Cuzco was universally acknowledged. This was the origin of a civil war; the beginning of which was very advantageous to Almagro, who by skilful manoeuvres entirely routed a body of Spanish troops advancing to the relief of Cuzco, and made Alvarado their commander prisoner. But instead of improving these advantages, he unwisely marched back to Cuzco, and there awaited the arrival of Pizarro. Pizarro, convinced of his own feeble resources, proposed an accommodation, and with his usual art protracted the negociation until he found himself in a condition to meet his antagonist in the field of battle. Meanwhile Alvarado and one of the Pizzaros, by bribing their keepers, found means to escape, and persuaded 60 of the men who guarded them to attend them in their flight; and the governor released the other Pizarro. When Pizarro thought himself sufficiently prepared to settle the dominion of Peru, he marched with an army of 500 men to Cuzco. Almagro, previous to this, worn out with age and infirmity, resigned the command to Orgognez. A fierce and bloody battle ensued, in which Almagro was made prisoner, his army defeated, and the commander wounded. About 140 soldiers fell in the field, and Orgognez, along with several others, was massacred in cold blood. During that fatal day, Almagro, placed in a litter, which was stationed on an eminence, beheld from thence the total defeat of his troops, and felt all the indignation of a folder who had seldom experienced defeat. He was taken prisoner, remained several months in confinement, and afterwards was tried, and condemned to death. In the view of an ignominious death, the courage of the veteran forsook him, and he unsuccessfully supplicated for life, in a manner unworthy of his former character. All the arguments he could employ were ineffectual. The Pizzaros remained unmoved by all his entreaties. As soon, however, as Almagro saw that his fate was inevitable, he refused his courage, and exhibited all his usual dignity and fortitude. In the year 1538, and in the 7th year of his age, he was strangled in prison, and afterwards beheaded. He left one son by an Indian woman of Panama; and in consequence of a power which the emperor had granted, he declared his son his successor in\nAlmagro, in the government, although he was then a prisoner in Lima.\n\nWith the qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, and infurmountable constancy, he blended the more amiable dispositions of frankness, generosity, and candour. These qualities rendered him beloved by his followers; and his misfortunes excited their sympathy and pity, so that his death was universally regretted, and particularly by the poor Indians, who deemed him their guardian and protector against the cruel and unfeeling Pizarro. Upon the whole review of his character, it appears just to conclude, that he was, although of inferior abilities, a more amiable man than his rival. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlmagro the Younger, by his courage, generosity, and other accomplishments, was placed at the head of the party after the death of his father. The father, conscious of his own inferiority from the total want of education, used every possible mean to improve the mind and embellish the manners of his son; so that he soon acquired those accomplishments which rendered him respected by illiterate adventurers, who cheerfully ranged around his standard; and, by his dexterity and skill, fought deliverance from the oppressions of Pizarro. Juan de Herrera, an officer of great abilities, continued still to direct his counsels and to regulate his enterprises; and, while Pizarro confined in his own security, a conspiracy was formed against him, which terminated in his death. The afflains, exulting in their success, and waving their bloody swords, halted to the street, proclaimed the death of the tyrant, and compelled the magistrates and principal citizens of Lima to acknowledge Almagro as lawful successor to his father. But his reign was of short duration; for, in 1541, Vaca de Castro, arriving at Quito, produced the royal commission, appointing him governor of Peru, together with all the privileges and authority of Pizarro. The talents and influence of the new governor soon overpowered the interest of Almagro, who, perceiving the rapid decline of his influence, hastened with his troops to Cuzco, where his opponents had erected the royal standard under the command of Pedro Álvarez Falgén. Herrera the guide of his counsels died during his march; and from that time his measures were conspicuous for their violence, concerted with little ingenuity, and executed with little address. On September 16, 1542, at length the forces of Almagro and Vaca de Castro met, and victory long remained doubtful; till at last it declared for the new governor. The followers of Almagro displayed uncommon valour, and Almagro conducted the military operations of that fatal day with a gallant spirit, worthy of a better cause and deserving of a better fate. In proportion to the number of combatants the carnage was very great. Of 1500 men 500 fell in the field, and many more were wounded. Almagro escaped, but being betrayed by some of his own officers, he was publicly beheaded at Cuzco, and in him the name and spirit of the party of Almagro became extinct. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlmamon, or Mamon, also named Abdallah, caliph of Bagdad, was born A.D. 785. His elder brother Al Amin succeeded to the caliphate on the death of his father, and Almamon at that time was governor of Chorasan. As by the will of the father it Almamon provided, that his three sons should succeed to the caliphate in order, Almamon ordered his elder brother to be proclaimed caliph throughout his government. But his brother repaid his friendship and attachment to his interest with open expressions of hatred, and unjust attempts to exclude him from the defined succession. Almamon was thus forced to consult measures for his own safety and promotion, by causing himself to be proclaimed caliph. After various struggles, his general, Thalier, in the year 813 took possession of Bagdad, pursued Al Amin to his retreat, and caused him to be assassinated, so that Almamon remained without a competitor. Various rebellions disturbed the tranquillity of the first years of his reign; but by his prudent administration and vigorous exertions, these were at length extinguished. Incited by the advice of his vizier, he soon after raised greater commotions, and exposed his dignity to greater dangers, by countenancing the sect of Ali. He invited to court Imam Rizza, gave him his daughter in marriage, and even declared him his successor in the empire. He assumed the green turban, the colour of the house of Ali, and obliged his courtiers and soldiers to imitate his example. Alarmed at these proceedings, the orthodox Mussulmans, and the house of Abbas, excited a great revolt in Bagdad, and proclaimed Ibrahim, Almamon's uncle, caliph. A civil war was just about to commence when Fadel the vizier was assassinated and Rizza died. The people of Bagdad then depoed Ibrahim, and returned to their former allegiance. Taking the advantage of Almamon's absence, Thalier his general seized upon the government of Chorasan, where he founded a dynasty which existed during a period of 16 years.\n\nAlmamon employed the period of tranquillity that followed in the introduction and improvement of literature into his dominions, which constitutes the greatest glory of his reign. During the days of his father he discovered an ardent thirst after knowledge, by forming a college in Chorasan, adorned with the most eminent men of various countries; and appointed Mefue, a famous Christian physician of Damascus, for their president. When his father remonstrated against conferring such an honour upon a Christian, he reminded him, that the most learned men and the most skilful artists in his dominions were Jews and Christians; and added, that he had chosen Mefue as a preceptor in science and useful arts, and not as a teacher of religion. Under his auspices Bagdad became the seat of literature, of private and academical instruction, and the habitation of men of eminence from all quarters. Many valuable books in the Greek, Persian, Chaldean, and Coptic languages, among which were the works of Aristotle and Galen, were translated into the Arabic at his own expense. The caliph himself deemed it an honour to set an example to others of the becoming respect due to mental cultivation, by visiting the schools, and treating the professors with great regard. In mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy, he made a rapid and extensive progress. He was the author of astronomical tables, which on account of their accuracy have been much admired. By these various exertions the character of the Saracens was suddenly changed from...\nAlmamon, a rude and ferocious to a polite and civilized people, while the most powerful and extensive of the European states were involved in ignorance and barbarism. Literature has sustained some irreparable losses from his too great partiality to the Arabic writers, which induced him to destroy the originals of the translated manuscripts. He is represented by the Sonnites or orthodox Mahometans as little better than an Infidel, because of his attention to philosophy and letters. His conduct, however, shows that he was not sufficiently careful to preserve a philosophical mean between the different religious parties during the time of his administration, as he openly manifested a predilection to the doctrines of the Motaellis, who asserted the free will of man, and denied the eternity of the Koran. Some allege, that on account of the murmurs which arose against him, he was induced to exhibit too great a zeal by establishing a kind of inquisition, to compel all his subjects to profess Islam. The experiment, however, soon terminated in the better and juster expedient of universal toleration; and it is abundantly evident, that the Christians in his dominions never felt the power of his inquisition.\n\nThe public transactions of his reign are in themselves important. In the year 822 he sent a body of his troops to the assistance of Thomas, a Greek, who made war on Michael the Stammerer, the emperor of Constantinople, and besieged his capital. This expedition, which on the part of the caliph seems to have been founded in injustice, proved unsuccessful; Thomas was taken prisoner, and suffered death. In the years 829 and 830 he commenced open hostilities upon the Greeks, rendered himself master of many places, and carried devastation into their territories. He was successful in suppressing a revolt in Egypt in the year 831. In this country he was led to discover a treasure buried under two columns by Merwan, the last caliph of the house of Ommiiah. In repairing a decayed masonry or measuring pillar, and erecting a new one for determining the gradation of the increase of the Nile, Almamon displayed his love of science. In the year 833 he again visited Egypt; on his return he penetrated into the territories of the Greek emperor, even into Cilicia. Returning home he encamped on the banks of a river, and, excited by thirst, drank too freely of the water; and at the same time indulged himself immoderately in eating a particular kind of dates, which brought on a complaint in his stomach, and reduced him to the most imminent danger. Sensible of his approaching dissolution, he wrote letters into all the provinces, announcing his brother Motafem his successor; and then patiently awaited the event. After a tedious struggle under the prelure of his disease, and while uttering this ejaculation; \"O thou who never died, have mercy on me, a dying man!\" he expired at the age of forty-eight or forty-nine years. He reigned 20 years and some months, and was buried at Tarbus, which some religious zealots interpreted as a mark of reprobation.\n\nThe history of this caliph affords an illustrious instance of the meliorating effect of science and literature upon the conduct and temper of rude and uncultivated men. Under the milder features of a liberal, virtuous, and benevolent sovereign, the usual cruelty of a Saracen and a despot seemed entirely lost. He displayed Almamon, an uncommon greatness of mind and an unusual example of clemency in his conduct towards his rival and uncle Ibrahim. After his deposition, that prince concealed himself in some sequestered corner of Bagdad. The place of his concealment being at length discovered, he was instantly brought before the caliph, and informed that the council had unanimously condemned him to death. \"Your counsellors (said Ibrahim) have judged, according to the customary rules of political government; if you pardon me, you will not, indeed, judge according to precedent, but you will have no equal among sovereigns.\" The caliph rose up and embracing him tenderly, with great emotion, said, \"Uncle be of good cheer; I will not do you the least injury;\" and he added to forgive us a fortune suitable to his birth and former elevated station. When Almamon's courtiers complimented him on this generous action, he exclaimed, \"O! did men but know the pleasure I feel in pardoning, all who have offended me would come and confess their faults.\" To the same generosity of disposition may be ascribed his strong predilection to the oppressed house of Ali, which filled the beginning of his reign with political troubles. By his frequent intercourse with men of enlightened minds, and of different religious sentiments, he acquired a liberality very unusual in a Mussulman; and his preference to some particular opinions seems to have originated from his own vigour of mind, and his knowledge of these opinions. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALMANACK, a book or table, containing a calendar of days and months, the rising and setting of the sun, the age of the moon, the eclipses of both luminaries, &c.—Authors are divided with regard to the etymology of the word; some deriving it from the Arabic particle al and manach, to count; some from almanach, new-year's gifts, because the Arabian astrologers used at the beginning of the year to make presents of their ephemerides; and others, from the Teutonic almanen achte, observations on all the months. Dr Johnson derives it from the Arabic particle al, and the Greek μήν, a month. But the most simple etymology appears from the common spelling; the word being composed of two Arabic ones, Al Manack, which signify the Diary. All the classes of Arabs are commonly much given to the study of astronomy and astrology; to both which a pastoral life, and a sort of husbandry, not only incline them, but afford time and opportunity to cultivate them. They neither sow, reap, plant, travel, buy or sell, or undertake any expedition or business, without previously consulting the stars, or, in other words, their almanacks, or some of the makers of them. From these people, by their vicinity to Europe, this art, no less useful in one sense than trifling and ridiculous in another, hath passed over hither; and those astronomical compositions have still everywhere not only retained their old Arabic name; but were, like theirs, for a long while, and still are among many European nations, intermixed with a great number of astrological rules for planting, sowing, bleeding, purging, &c. down to the cutting of the hair and paring of the nails.—Regiomontanus appears to have been the first in Europe, however, who reduced almanacks into their present form and method, gave the characters of each\nAlmanack each year and month, foretold the eclipses and other phases, calculated the motions of the planets, &c. His first almanack was published in 1474.\n\nThe essential part of an almanack is the calendar of months and days, with the risings and settings of the sun, age of the moon, &c. To these are added various parerga, astronomical, meteorological, chronological, political, rural, &c., as calculations and accounts of eclipses, solar ingresses, prognostics of the weather, tables of the tides, terms, &c., lists of posts, offices, dignities, public institutions, with many other articles political as well as local, and differing in different countries. A great variety are annually published in Britain; some for binding, which may be denominated book almanacks; others in loose papers, called sheet almanacks.\n\nThe modern almanack answers to the Fasti of the ancient Romans. See FASTI.\n\nConstruction of Almanacks. The first thing to be done is, to compute the sun's and moon's place for each day of the year, or it may be taken from some ephemerides and entered into the almanack; next, find the dominical letter, and, by means thereof, distribute the calendar into weeks; then, having computed the time of Easter, by it fix the other moveable feasts; adding the immovable ones, with the names of the martyrs, the rising and setting of each luminary, the length of day and night, the aspects of the planets, the phases of the moon, and the sun's entrance into the cardinal points of the ecliptic, i.e. the two equinoxes and solstices. (See ASTRONOMY, paffim.) By the help of good astronomical tables or ephemerides, the construction of almanacks is extremely easy.\n\nFor every almanack or calendar for one year or less, a stamp duty of 8d. must be paid. And for every almanack serving more than a year, the same duty is paid for each year. Perpetual almanacks pay for three years only. All books and pamphlets serving chiefly the purpose of almanacks, are charged as such. If any almanack contains more than one sheet, one sheet only need be stamped; and every almanack required by law to be so printed, that some part of the print shall be upon the stamp. Selling unstamped almanacks incurs the same penalty as for selling unstamped newspapers. Almanacks in bibles and common prayer books are exempted.\n\nAlmanack, among Antiquaries, is also the name given to a kind of instrument, usually of wood, inscribed with various figures and Runic characters, and representing the order of the feasts, dominical letters, days of the week, and golden number, with other matters necessary to be known throughout the year used by the ancient northern nations, in their computations of time, both civil and ecclesiastical. Almanacks of this kind are known by various names, among the different nations wherein they have been used; as rimlocks, primasters, runflocks, runstaffs, Scipiones Ravici, Baculi Annales, clogs, &c. They appear to have been used only by the Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians. From the second of these people, their use was introduced into England, whence divers remains of them in the counties. Dr Plot has given the description and figure of one of these clogs, found in Staffordshire, under the title of The Perpetual Staffordshire Almanack. The external figure and matter of these calendars appear to have been various. Sometimes they were cut on one or more wooden leaves, Almanor bound together after the manner of books; sometimes on the scabbards of swords, or even on daggers; sometimes on tools and implements, as portable steelyards, hammers, the halves of hatchets, flails, &c. Sometimes they were made of braids or horn; sometimes of the skins of eels, which being drawn over a stick properly inscribed, retained the impressions of it. But the most usual form was that of walking staves, or sticks, which they carried about with them to church, market, &c. Each of these staves is divided into three regions; whereof the first indicates the signs, the second the days of the week and year, and the third the golden number. The characters engraved on them are, in some, the ancient Runic; in others the later Gothic characters of Ulphilus. The saints' days are expressed in hieroglyphics, significant either of some endowment of the saint, the manner of his martyrdom, or the like. Thus, against the notch for the first of March, or St David's day, is represented a harp; against the 23rd of October, or Crispin's day, a pair of shoes; against the 12th of August, or St Lawrence's day, a gridiron; and lastly, against New-year's day, a horn, the symbol of liberal potations, which our ancestors indulged in at that season.\n\nALMANSOR the Victorious, the second caliph of the house of Al Abbas, succeeded his brother Abul Abbas Al Safah, in the year 753, of the Hegira 136, and in the following year was inaugurated at Al Hashemiyah. Although Al Safah had declared him presumptive heir of the crown, and he had been proclaimed caliph in the imperial city of Anbar, yet immediately upon his inauguration, his uncle Abdallah ibn Ali had sufficient interest to cause himself to be proclaimed caliph at Damascus. In Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia, he collected a numerous army, and arrived at the banks of the Euphrates, near Nisibis, where he encamped, ready to dispute his royal acclamation by arms. Almanor collected an immense army in Persia, Khorasan, and Irak, and gave the command of it to Abu Moflem, who harassed his uncle's troops for five months, and at last totally defeated him, A.D. 754. Notwithstanding the services which Abu Moflem had rendered to the family of Al Abbas, after this victory he became an object of jealousy, and was affianced in the presence of Almanor himself, by his express order. After the death of Abu Moflem, the standard of rebellion was raised by Sinon a Magian, who seized on the treasures of the deceased governor of Khorasan, and excited the people of that country to a general revolt; but this insurrection was suddenly quelled by the general of Almanor, Jamhur ibn Morad. The caliph avengingly seized the spoils of this victory, which so incensed Jamhur that he immediately turned his arms against his royal master; but he was soon defeated by the caliph's forces. The patriarch of Antioch was about this time detected in an illicit correspondence with the Grecian emperor, and consequently was banished into an obscure part of Palestine; and in the mean time the Christians in the dominions of the caliph were prohibited from building or repairing any churches, and also were laid under several other severe restraints.\n\nAlmanor sent a large army into Cappadocia in the year 757, fortified the city of Malatia or Melitene,\nAlmanfor, litene, and deposited in it a great part of his treasures. But in this year he was attacked by a sect of believers in the metempsychosis, called the Rawandians. This sect assembled at Al Hashimiyyah the residence of the caliph, and by the ceremony of going in procession round his palace, intimated their purpose of invoking him as a deity, and paying him divine homage. Incensed by their impiety, the caliph ordered several of these sectaries to be imprisoned, which roused their resentment, and led them to form the design of his assassination. The generous interposition of Maan ibn Zaidet an Ommiyan chief, who had been under the necessity of concealing himself from the caliph's resentment, however defeated their intention. This insult received in his capital, induced him to build the city of Bagdad, and to fix his residence there, A.D. 762. In the preceding year a plan was formed to dethrone him; but it being discovered, he severely punished all who were either directly or indirectly concerned in it. Abdallah his uncle shared the fate of other rebels: for being allured to court under the promise of pardon and protection, he was placed in a building which was so constructed that it immediately fell and crushed him in its ruins. Not long after his residence at Bagdad, he was seized with a disorder of which he was cured by the advice of a famous Christian physician, whose name was George ibn Baktifluwa Al Jondaburi. The caliph, previously informed that he was married to a wife old and infirm, as a compensation presented him with three beautiful Greek girls, and a considerable sum of money; the girls, to the caliph's surprise, were sent back, with a declaration on the part of George, that it was not lawful for a Christian to have more wives than one at a time. The conduct of the physician, on this occasion, raised him in the esteem of the caliph, and procured him a greater profusion of favours. In his succeeding military transactions, Almanfor was generally victorious. His conduct to his Christian subjects was rigorous and severe. He set out on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the year 774, and being seized on the road with a dangerous disease, he sent for his son and intended successor Al Mohdi, and gave him some salutary advice. \"I command you,\" said he, \"to treat publicly your relations with the greatest marks of distinction, since this conduct will reflect no small degree of honour and glory upon yourself. Increase the number of your freedmen, and treat them with all kindness, as they will be of great service to you in your adversity; but neither this, nor the other injunction will you fulfil. Enlarge not that part of your capital erected on the eastern bank of the Tigris, as you will never be able to finish it; but this work I know you will attempt. Never permit any of your women to intermeddle in affairs of state, or to have any influence over your counsels; but this advice I know you will not take. These are my last commands; or, if you please, my dying advice; and to God I now recommend you.\" In parting they both gave vent to their feelings in a flood of tears. He pursued his journey to Bir-Maimun, i.e., the well of Maimun, where he died in the 63rd year of his age and the 20th of his reign, and his remains were interred at Mecca.\n\nThe character of Almanfor was formed of very different and even contradictory qualities. His temper conciliated affection and attachment in private life, but in his public character his aspect and demeanour inspired terror. He was well acquainted with the arts of government; he was prudent and brave, but perfidious, covetous, cruel, and implacable; and amid such a variety of character, it is singular that he should have displayed a love of study and literature, and particularly of astronomy. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALMANZA, a little town of New Castile, on the frontiers of the kingdom of Valencia in Spain, situated in W. Long. 1. 19. N. Lat. 38. 54. It is remarkable for the defeat of the allies in 1707, under the marquis de las Minas and the earl of Galway. In the beginning of this action the English troops penetrated through the centre of the Spanish army; but the Portuguese cavalry being broken by the Spanish, and the French infantry making a dreadful fire on their flanks, the allied army was at last broken, and began their retreat when it was almost dark. Colonel Hill carried off the remains of thirteen battalions towards the river Xucar, which, if they could have paused, they might have been safe; but being very much fatigued, they were obliged to halt; by which means they were surrounded, and forced to surrender prisoners of war. In this battle, the allies lost 120 standards, together with all their artillery and baggage; a great number were killed, and several thousands taken prisoners. The Marquis de las Minas was dangerously wounded; and his mistress, in the garb of an amazon, killed by his side. The earl of Galway had two cuts across the face, which, though not dangerous, had prevented him from seeing, or giving orders properly.\n\nHERESY OF ALMARIC, a tenet broached in France by one Almaric, in the year 1209. It consisted in affirming, that every Christian was actually a member of Christ; and that without this faith no one could be saved. His followers went farther, and affirmed, that the power of the Father lasted only during the continuance of the Mosaic law; that the coming of Christ introduced a new law; that at the end of this began the reign of the Holy Ghost; and that now confession and the sacraments were at an end, and that every one is to be saved by the internal operations of the Holy Spirit alone, without any external act of religion.—Their morals were as infamous as their doctrine was absurd. Their tenets were condemned by a public decree of the council of Sens, in the year 1209.\n\nALME, or ALMA, singing and dancing girls in Egypt, who, like the Italian Improvisatori, can occasionally pour forth \"unpremeditated verse.\" They are called Almé, from having received a better education than other women. They form a celebrated society in that country. To be received into it, according to M. Savary, it is necessary to have a good voice, to understand the language well, to know the rules of poetry, and be able to compose and sing couplets on the spot, adapted to the circumstances. The Almé know by heart all the new songs. Their memory is furnished with the most beautiful tales. There is no festival without them; no entertainment of which they do not constitute the ornament. They are placed in a rostrum, from whence they sing during the repast. They then descend into the falcon, and form dances which have no resemblance to ours. They are pantomime ballets, in which they represent the usual occurrences of life. The mysteries of love, too, generally\ngenerally furnish them with scenes. The suppleness of their bodies is inconceivable. One is astonished at the mobility of their features, to which they give at pleasure the impression suited to the characters they play. The indecency of their attitudes is often carried to excess. Their looks, their gestures, every thing speaks, but in so expressive a manner, that it is impossible to mistake them. At the beginning of the dance, they lay aside with their veils the modesty of their sex. A long robe of very thin silk goes down to their heels, which is slightly fastened with a rich girdle. Long black hair, plaited and perfumed, is flowing on their shoulders. A shift, transparent as gauze, scarcely hides their bosom. As they put themselves in motion, the shapes, the contours of their bodies, seem to develop themselves successively. Their steps are regulated by the sound of the flute, of cattanets, the tambour de basque, and cymbals, which accelerates or retards the measure. They are still further animated by words adapted to such scenes. They appear in a state of intoxication. They are the Bacchants in a delirium. It is when they are at this point, that throwing off all reserve, they abandon themselves totally to the disorder of their senses; it is then that a people far from delicate, and who like nothing hidden, redouble their applause. These Almé are sent for into all the harems. They teach the women the new airs; they amuse them with amorous tales, and recite in their presence poems, which are so much the more interesting, as they furnish a lively picture of their manners. They initiate them into the mysteries of their art, and teach them to contrive lascivious dances. These girls, who have cultivated understanding, are very agreeable in conversation. They speak their language with purity. The habit of dedicating themselves to poetry renders the softest and most sonorous expressions familiar to them. They repeat with a great deal of grace. In singing, nature is their only guide. Sometimes two of them sing together, but always with the same voice. It is the same with an orchestra, where all the instruments playing in unison execute the same part.\n\nThe Almé assist at the marriage-ceremonies, and march before the bride, playing on instruments. They make a figure likewise at funerals, and accompany the procession, singing sorrowful airs. They break forth into groans and lamentations, and give every sign of grief and despair. These women are paid very high, and seldom appear but amongst the grandees and rich men.\n\nThe common people have also their Almé. They are girls of the second class, who try to imitate the former; but they have neither their elegance, their graces, nor their knowledge. They are everywhere to be met with. The public places and the walks about Grand Cairo are full of them. As the populace require allusions still more strongly marked, decency will not permit the relation to what a pitch they carry the licentiousness of their gestures and attitudes.\n\nALMEDIA, a frontier town of Portugal, in the province of Tralos Montes, on the confines of Leon, where there was a very brisk action between the French and Portuguese in 1663; 17 miles north-west of Ciudad Rodrigo. W. Long. 7° 10'. N. Lat. 42° 41'.\n\nALMEHRAB, in the Mahometan Customs, a niche in their mosques, pointing towards the kebla or temple of Mecca, to which they are obliged to bow in praying. See KEBLA.\n\nALMEISAR, a celebrated game among the ancient Arabs, performed by a kind of casting of lots with arrows, strictly forbidden by the law of Mahomet, on account of the frequent quarrels occasioned by it.\n\nThe manner of the game was thus: A young camel being brought and killed, was divided into a number of parts. The adventurers, to the number of seven, being met, 11 arrows were provided without heads or feathers; seven of which were marked, the first with one notch, the second with two, the third with three, &c. the other four had no marks. These arrows were put promiscuously into a bag, and thus drawn by an indifferent person. Those to whom the marked arrows fell, won shares in proportion to their lot; the rest to whom the blanks fell, were entitled to no part of the camel, but obliged to pay the whole price of it. Even the winners tasted not of the flesh themselves more than the losers, but the whole was distributed to the poor.\n\nALMENE, in Commerce, a weight of two pounds used to weigh saffron in several parts of the continent of the East Indies.\n\nALMERIA, a sea-port town in the kingdom of Granada in Spain, pleasantly situated on a fine bay at the mouth of the river Almeria, on the Mediterranean. W. Long. 3° 20'. N. Lat. 36° 51'. This town is by some thought to have risen upon the ruins of the ancient Abdera, and was formerly a place of great consequence. It was taken from the Moors in 1147, by the emperor Conrad III., in conjunction with the French, Geneoese, and Pisans. It was at that time the strongest place in Spain held by the Infidels; from which their privateers, which were exceedingly numerous, not only troubled the sea-coasts inhabited by the Christians, but gave equal disturbance to the maritime provinces of France, Italy, and the adjacent islands. The city being well fortified, having a strong castle, a numerous garrison, and being excellently provided with everything necessary, made a vigorous resistance; but was at last taken by storm, when the victor put to the sword all the inhabitants who were found in arms, distributing the best part of the plunder among his allies, whom he sent away thoroughly satisfied. The Geneoese, particularly, acquired here that emerald vessel which still remains in their treasury, and is deemed invaluable.\n\nUpon its reduction by the Christians, Almeria became a bishopric; but is at present very little better than a village, indifferently inhabited, and has nothing to tellify so much as the probability of its former greatness, except certain circumstances which cannot be effaced even by the indolence of the Spaniards themselves. What these are, Udal ap Rhys, a Welshman, thus describes, in his Tour through Spain and Portugal. \"Its climate (says he) is so peculiarly blest, that one really wants words to express its charms and excellence. Its fields and meads are covered with flowers all the year round; they are adorned also with palms, myrtles, plane trees, oranges, and olives; and the mountains and promontories near it are as noted for their producing a great variety of precious stones, inasmuch that the next promontory to it is called the Cape of Gates, which is a corruption from the word agates, the hills...\"\nAlmiggim hills thereabouts abounding in that fort of precious stones, as well as in emeralds and amethysts, garnets or coarse rubies, and extreme curious alabaster in the mountains of Filaures.\"\n\nALMIGGIM. See ALMUGGIM.\n\nALMEYDA, DON FRANCIS, was the son of the Count d'Abrantes, a grandee of Portugal, who served with great distinction in the war of Ferdinand of Castile with Granada; and in consequence of his important services he became highly esteemed in the court of his sovereign. Without any solicitation on his part he was nominated the first governor general and viceroy of the newly conquered countries in the East Indies; and set sail from Lisbon in March 1505-6 with a powerful fleet. To give dignity and influence to his elevated station, a body of guards was appointed to attend his person, several chaplains were assigned him, together with every other appendage of grandeur. He touched at the Cape Verde islands, doubled the Cape at a considerable distance to the south, and arrived at Gulloa. From thence he proceeded to Mombaza, a well fortified city in an island, which he reduced, and proceeded to the Angediva islands not far from Goa, where he built a fort; he likewise erected and garrisoned another fort at Cannanor, and arriving at Cochin, he secured it to the Portuguese interest. The island of Madagascar was discovered during his government, and his son Don Lorenzo first surveyed the Maldives islands; and about the same time discovered the fine island of Ceylon, the principal sovereign of which he brought under submission to the crown of Portugal. Returning from this expedition, while employed in the fleet destined against Calicut, he lost his life in a sea-fight against the Zamorin. His father sustained his loss with a heroic firmness, saying, \"that Lorenzo could not die better than in the service of his country.\" On the arrival of Alphonso d'Albuquerque, who was destined to be his successor, Almeida yielded to the impressions of jealousy; and under the pretence of misconduct he confined him in the citadel of Cannanor. He engaged in 1508, the whole force of the Mahommedans in the port of Diu; and, gaining a complete victory, facilitated the enterprises of Albuquerque his successor, by contributing to break that formidable league by which the Zamorin was in hopes of being able to compel the Portuguese to abandon their Indian conquests. Returning home with the great riches which he had acquired, he unfortunately touched at Saldanha Point on the coast of Africa, where some of the sailors, in quest of water, quarrelled with the natives, who attacked and drove them to their ships. With a view to revenge this pretended affront, they persuaded Almeida himself to go ashore, with a body of 150 men, armed only with swords and lances. While stepping into the boat, Almeida exclaimed, \"whither do you carry my 60 years?\" The Portuguese furiously rushed on to attack the natives, whose numbers were greatly augmented, and Almeida with 57 of his men were killed in this rash and unprovoked attempt. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALMISSA, a small but strong town at the mouth of the Cetina, in Dalmatia, famous for its piracies; ten miles east of Spalatro. E. Long. 18. 14. N. Lat. 43. 56.\n\nALMOHEDES, the name of a dynasty, which, in the commencement of the twelfth century, succeeded Almoravides in Barbary. It derived its name from an obscure founder called Al Mohedi, or Al Mohedes, and it rose into public notice in the 25th year of the reign of Al Abraham, or Brahem, who succeeded his father Ali, A.D. 1115. This person was a Bereber, and was a famous preacher of the tribe of Muzamada, which was settled along Mount Atlas. His scheme was the exertion of ingenuity, and it was executed with unremitting activity. In order to obtain attention and success, he assumed the title of Mohdi or Mohedi, and claimed the honour of leader of the orthodox, or unitarians, and, by his preaching they became so numerous, that he even dared to let the royal power at defiance. Confident of security, and immersed in pleasure, Brahem looked with a contemptuous eye upon the infraction of a party composed of such persons. They increased in number and strength, so that the king was at last roused from his indolence, and prepared for his own security and their subjection. In the first engagement he was defeated, being overpowered with superior numbers. The artful Abdallah took possession of the capital, so that Brahem, pursued as a fugitive by Abdolmumen, one of the party, sought refuge in the city of Fez. The gates were shut against him; but they were opened to admit his pursuers. He next took refuge in the city of Auran, or Oran; but he was pursued by Abdolmumen, who threatened to destroy the city with fire and sword; and the magistrates, unable to defend themselves, urged him to leave the town, and provide for his own safety. Concealed by the darkness of the night, he escaped with his favourite wife on horseback behind him; but being closely pursued by the enemy, rather than fall into their hands, he rushed over a precipice, and, along with his wife, he was dashed to pieces. Such was the death of this prince, which put a final period to the empire of the Almoravides. When the death of Brahem was known, Abdolmumen was chosen by the chiefs of that party his successor, and proclaimed king of the Almohedes, under the title of Al Emir Al Mumin Abdallah Mohammed Abdal Mumin Ebn Abdallah Ibbi Ali, i.e. Chief or Emperor of the true Believers of the house of Mohammed Abdal Mumin, the son of Abdal Mumin, the son of Abdallah, of the lineage of Ali. Abdallah, during his reign, enacted prudential laws for the establishment of his new kingdom, and the regulation of the conduct of his followers. He appointed a council of forty of his disciples, all of whom were preachers. Some of these were commissioned to regulate all public affairs; and at proper seasons they went forth as itinerant preachers for the purpose of strengthening their party, and spreading their doctrines, and fifteen of their number acted as secretaries. As both the regal and pontifical dignities were united in the same person, the king was chosen from both of these two classes. The disciples of this sect were denominated Mohammedin, or Ali Mohaddin; but the Arabian writers only style them preachers, and the Spanish Al Mohedes. The descendants and successors of that tribe continued to retain the appellation of Emir Al Muminin, or chiefs of the faithful believers, as long as their dynasty lasted; and they became very powerful both in Africa and Spain. By their invectives against the\nAlmohades, the tyranny of the Almoravides, and their loud clamours for liberty, they induced the greater part of the kingdom to revolt, and to embrace their religious doctrines. The chief thing in them was their specious pretence to orthodoxy, and strict adherence to the unity of the Godhead, which they inculcated with the greatest zeal and diligence.\n\nOn his accession to power, the new sovereign extinguished all the unhappy remains and steady adherents of this race, by strangling Ifaac the son of Brahem. The Almoravides governor taking advantage of the general tumult and distraction that prevailed, constituted their governments into independent principalities and petty kingdoms; and they who inhabited the mountainous parts, established under their own chevys a variety of lordships. The Libyans and Nubians took the lead, and the states of Barbary, Tripoli, Kairwan, Tunis, Algiers, Tremecen, and Bujeyah, followed their example. Abdolmumun, however, successfully pursued his conquests; and in a few years he reduced to his subjection the Numidians and Galatians in the west, and the kingdoms of Tunis, Tremecen, and the greatest part of Mauritania and Tingitana. He expelled the Christians of Mohedia, the chief city of Africa, and some others on the same coast; and likewise made conquests both in Spain and Portugal. He died in the seventh year of his reign, and was succeeded, A.D. 1156, by his son Yulef or Joseph. Yulef proved a valiant and martial prince, and in his military court he first established the kings of Tunis and Bujeyah in their respective dominions, as his tributaries and vassals; and then by earnest solicitation he embarked for Spain to assist the Moorish princes. Yakub or Jacob, or the conqueror, succeeding him after providing for his own safety against the revolted and plundering Arabs, pursued his conquests with such success, that he soon became master of the whole country lying between Numidia and the entire length of the Barbary coasts, from Tripoli to the boundaries of the kingdom of Morocco. Thus he was acknowledged as sovereign by most of the Arabian Moorish princes in his Spanish dominions; but also extended his territory above 1200 leagues in length, and 480 in breadth.\n\nThe remaining part of the history of this prince is involved in obscurity. About the year 1206, he quelled a revolt in Morocco, but violated his faith with the governor of the capital, which he reduced, and in a cruel and perfidious manner he extirpated all his adherents. Touched, it is said, with remorse, he disappeared, and, according to report, wandered about obscure and unknown, until he died in the humble condition of a baker at Alexandria. His son Mohammed, named Al Naker, succeeded his father; and, on his accession to the crown, he passed over into Spain with an immense army of 120,000 horse and 300,000 foot, and engaging the whole force of the Christians on the plains of Tholofa, received a total defeat, with the loss of above 150,000 foot, 30,000 horse, and 50,000 prisoners. According to Spanish and other historians, this famous battle was fought in 617, A.D. 1220; but according to the Arabian writers, it was in the year of the Hegira 629, A.D. 1212. Returning home to Africa, he was received with coldness and disgust by his subjects, on account of his defeat; and soon after died of vexation, having appointed his grand-\n\nfon Zeyed Arrax his successor. A descendant of the Abdolwates, ancient monarchs of the kingdom, named Gamarazan Ebn Zezen, of the tribe of the Zeneti, caused him to be assassinated. With him terminated the dynasty or government of the Almohades, having possessed it for about 170 years, which gave place to that of the Benimerini, another branch of the Zeneti. These having enlarged their conquests, and enriched themselves by frequent inroads, not only into the neighbouring kingdoms, but even Nubia, Libya, and Numidia, were at length lost in the general prevalence of Mohamedism, after having existed 117 years.\n\n(Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nALMOND, the fruit of the almond tree. See Amygdalus, Botany Index.\n\nALMOND, in Commerce, a measure by which the Portuguese sell their oil: 26 almonds make a pipe.\n\nALMONDS, in Anatomy, a name sometimes given to two glands, generally called the tonsils.\n\nALMONDS, among Lapidaries, signify pieces of rock-crystal, used in adorning branch-candlesticks, &c., on account of the resemblance they bear to the fruit of that name.\n\nALMOND Furnace, among Refiners, that in which the flags of litharge, left in refining silver, are reduced to lead again by the help of charcoal.\n\nALMONDBURY, a village in England, in the west riding of Yorkshire, five miles from Halifax.\n\nALMONEER, in its primitive sense, denotes an officer in religious houses, to whom belonged the management and distribution of the alms of the house. By the ancient canons, all monasteries were to spend at least a tenth part of their income in alms to the poor. The almoner of St Paul's is to dispose of the moneys left for charity, according to the appointment of the donors, to bury the poor who die in the neighbourhood, and to breed up eight boys to singing, for the use of the choir. By an ancient canon, all bishops are required to keep almoners.\n\nLord Almoner, or Lord High Almoner of England, is an ecclesiastical officer, generally a bishop, who has the forfeiture of all deadlands, and the goods of felons de se, which he is to distribute among the poor. He has also, by virtue of an ancient custom, the power of giving the first dish from the king's table to whatever poor person he pleases, or, instead of it, an alms in money.\n\nGreat Almoner, Grand Almonier, in France, before the revolution, was the highest ecclesiastical dignity in that kingdom. To him belonged the superintendency of all hospitals and houses of lepers. The king received the sacrament from his hand; and he sat mats before the king in all grand ceremonies and solemnities.\n\nAlmoner is also a more fashionable title given by some writers to chaplains. In this sense we meet with almoner of a ship, almoner of a regiment.\n\nALMONRY, or Aubury, the office or lodgings of the almoner; also the place where alms are given. See Aubury.\n\nALMORAVIDES, in History, the name of an Arab tribe, who took possession of a district of Africa, with the pretence of living in retirement, that their minds might not be distracted from the rigid observance of the precepts of the Koran. Hence they assumed the name of Morabites, which was changed by the\nAlmoravi- the Spaniards into that of Almoravides. Abubeker ben Omar, called by the Spanish authors Abu Texe- fien, was the first chief of this tribe. Supported by a powerful army of malecontents from the provinces of Numidia and Libya, which was assembled by the influence of the Morabites, or Marabouts, he founded the dynasty of the Almoravides in Barbary, in the year 1051. Texeifen was succeeded by his son Yufc or Joseph, who, after having reduced to a state of vassalage the kingdoms of Tremecen, Fez, and Tunis, passed over into Spain during the time of the civil wars, vigorously repulsed the Christians, and soon saw the greatest part of the kingdoms of Murcia, Granada, Cordova, Leon, and some parts of Valencia, subjected to his power. He then returned into Africa, and left his newly acquired dominions, with a considerable army, under the government of his nephew Moham- med. On his arrival in Africa, with a view to prosecute and extend his conquests in Spain, he announced, in a public declaration, a general gazie, or religious war; assembled a numerous army, with which he embarked at Ceuta; and rejoining his nephew in Andalusia, soon laid waste that province with fire and sword.\n\nIn the year 1107, five years afterwards, he undertook another invasion, penetrated into the kingdom of Portugal, and reduced the city of Lisbon, with a considerable part of the kingdom. At this time he lost the cities of Alguazir and Gibraltar, which he had formerly taken. On his return to Barbary, he was defeated at sea. This induced him to propose a truce, which was agreed to only on condition of his submitting to become the tributary of the Spanish king. Indignant at these humiliating terms, Yufc made a vow that he would never desist in his attempts, till he had utterly rooted out the Christian religion in Spain. He made preparations accordingly for a fresh invasion, embarked his army, and landing at Malaga, marched into the enemy's country. His progress was rapid; but his measures were inconsiderately planned and rashly executed. In the famous battle of the Seven Counts, he was indeed victorious, but after a terrible slaughter, and the loss of great part of his army. This disastrous victory obliged him to return to Africa; and he died soon after at his capital of Morocco. Ali his son, succeeded to the sovereignty in 1110. This prince who seems to have been of a less warlike disposition than his father, neglecting his Spanish conquests, turned his attention to the arts of peace, and erected many sumptuous buildings, and in particular the great mosque of Morocco. Alphonso, then king of Aragon, retook from him some considerable cities; which obliged him to undertake an expedition to Spain in support of the Moorish princes. But all his attempts proved unfortunate; and in his last enterprise, though powerfully assisted by the Moorish chiefs, with the loss of 30,000 men he was defeated and slain by Alphonso, in the sixth year of his reign.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Al Abraham, who devoted himself entirely to pleasure. His subjects were harassed and oppressed with heavy taxes, which excited discontent and open rebellion. A revolution was soon effected, and in the 25th year of his reign, the government transferred from the tribe of the Almoravides to the Almohades. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nALMS, a general term for what is given out of charity to the poor.\n\nIn the early ages of Christianity, the alms of the charitable were divided into four parts; one of which was allotted to the bishop, another to the priests, and a third to the deacons and subdeacons, which made their whole subsistence; the fourth part was employed in relieving the poor, and in repairing the churches.\n\nNo religious system is more frequent or warm in its exhortations to almsgiving than the Mahometan. The Alcoran represents alms as a necessary means to make prayer be heard. Hence that saying of one of their caliphs: \"Prayer carries us half way to God, fasting brings us to the door of his palace, and alms introduces us into the presence chamber.\" Hence many illustrious examples of this virtue among the Mahometans. Hafan, the son of Ali, and grandson of Mohammed, in particular, is related to have thrice in his life divided his substance equally between himself and the poor, and twice to have given away all he had. And the generality are so addicted to the doing of good, that they extend their charity even to brutes.\n\nALMS, also denotes lands or other effects left to churches or religious houses, on condition of praying for the soul of the donor. Hence,\n\nFree ALMS, that which is liable to no rent or service.\n\nReasonable ALMS, a certain portion of the estates of intestate persons, allotted to the poor.\n\nALMS-Box, or Cheft, a small chest, or coffer, called by the Greeks κάστρον, wherein anciently the alms were collected, both at church and at private houses.\n\nThe almshoest, in English churches, is a strong box, with a hole in the upper part, having three keys, one to be kept by the parson or curate, the other two by the church-wardens. The erecting of such alms-chest in every church is enjoined by the book of canons, as also the manner of distributing what is thus collected among the poor of the parish.\n\nALMS-House, a petty kind of hospital, for the maintenance of a certain number of poor, aged, or disabled people.\n\nALMUCANTARS, in Astronomy, an Arabic word denoting circles of the sphere passing through the centre of the sun, or a star, parallel to the horizon, being the same as PARALLELS OF ALTITUDE.\n\nALMUCANTAR'S-STAFF, is an instrument usually made of pear-tree or box, having an arch of 15 degrees; used to take observations of the sun, about the time of its rising and setting, in order to find the amplitude, and consequently the variation of the compass.\n\nALMUCIUM denotes a kind of cover for the head, worn chiefly by monks and ecclesiastics. It was of a square form, and seems to have given rise to the bonnets of the same shape still retained in universities and cathedrals.\n\nALMUGGIM, ALMIGGIM, or ALMUG TREE, a certain kind of wood mentioned in the first book of Kings (x. 11.), which the Vulgate translates ligna thyma, and the Septuagint wrought wood. The Rabbins generally render it coral; others, ebony, brazil, or pine. But it is observed, that the almug tree can by no means be coral, because that is not fit for the purpose that the Scripture tells us the almug tree\nAlnwick was used, such as musical instruments, flutes, &c.\n\nThe word *thyrsus* is a name for the citron tree, known by the ancients, and very much esteemed for its sweet odour and great beauty. It came from Mauritania.\n\nThe almug tree, or *almugim*, *algumim*, or simply *gumim*, taking *al* for a kind of article, is therefore by the best commentators understood to be an oily and gummy sort of wood; and particularly that sort of tree which produces the gum ammoniac, which is also thought to be the same with the Shittim wood, whereof there is such frequent mention made by Moses.\n\n**ALMUNECAR**, a sea-port town in the kingdom of Granada, seated on the Mediterranean, with a good harbour, defended by a strong castle, 20 miles south of Alhama. W. Long. 3° 45'. N. Lat. 36° 50'.\n\n**ALNAGE**, or **ALNAG**, the measuring of woollen manufactures with an ell. It was at first intended as a proof of the goodness of that commodity; and accordingly a seal was invented as a mark that the commodity was made according to the statute; but, being now possible to purchase these seals, they are affixed, whenever the vender pleases, to all cloths indiscriminately, to the great prejudice of our woollen manufactures.\n\n**ALNAGER**, **ALNEGER**, or **ALNEGER**, q.d. measurer by the ell, signifies a sworn public officer, who, by himself or deputy, is to look to the assize of woollen cloth made throughout the land, i.e. the length, width, and work thereof; and to the seals for that purpose ordained. The office of king's alnager seems to have been derived from the statute of Richard I. A.D. 1197, which ordained, that there should be only one weight and one measure throughout the kingdom; and that the custody of the assize, or standard of weights and measures, should be committed to certain persons in every city and borough. His business was, for a certain fee, to measure all cloths made for sale, till the office was abolished by the statute 11 and 12 W. III. cap. 20.\n\n**ALNUS**, the **ALDER TREE**. See **BETULA**, Botany Index.\n\n**ALNUS**, in the Ancient Theatres, that part which was most distant from the stage.\n\n**ALNWICK**, a thoroughfare town in Northumberland, on the road to Scotland. Here Malcolm, king of Scotland, making an inroad into Northumberland, was killed, with Edward his son, and his army defeated by Robert Moubray, earl of this county, anno 1102. Likewise William, king of Scotland, in 1174, invading England with an army of 80,000 men, was here encountered, his army routed, and himself made prisoner. The town is populous, and in general well built; it has a large town-house, where the quarter-sessions and county-courts are held, and members of parliament elected. It has a spacious square, in which a market is held every Saturday. Alnwick appears to have been formerly fortified, by the vestiges of a wall still visible in many parts, and three gates which remain almost entire. It is governed by four chamberlains, who are chosen once in two years out of a common council, consisting of 24 members. It is ornamented by a stately old Gothic castle, which has been the seat of the noble family of Percy, earls of Northumberland. As the audits for receipt of rents have ever been in this castle, it has always been kept in tolerable repair; and not many years ago, it was repaired and beautified by the duke of Northumberland, who made very considerable alterations, upon a most elegant plan, with a view to reside in it some part of the summer season. The manner of making freemen is peculiar to this place, and indeed is as ridiculous as singular. The persons who are to be made free, or, as the phrase is, leap the well, assemble in the market-place, very early in the morning, on the 25th of April, being St Mark's day. They appear on horseback, with every man his sword by his side, dressed in white, and with white nightcaps, attended by the four chamberlains and the castle bailiff, mounted and armed in the same manner; from hence they proceed, with music playing before them, to a large dirty pool, called Freeman's-well, where they dismount, and draw up in a body, at some distance from the water; and then rush into it all at once, and scramble through the mud as fast as they can. As the water is generally very foul, they come out in a dirty condition; but taking a dram, they put on dry clothes, remount their horses, and ride full gallop round the confines of the district; then re-enter the town, sword in hand, and are met by women dressed in ribbons with bells and garlands, dancing and singing. These are called *timber-wrights*. The houses of the new freemen are on this day distinguished by a great holly bush, as a signal for their friends to assemble and make merry with them after their return. This ceremony is owing to King John, who was mired in this well, and who, as a punishment for not mending the road, made this a part of their charter. Alnwick is 310 miles north by west from London, 33 north of Newcastle, and 29 south of Berwick. Long. 1° 10'. Lat. 55° 24'.\n\n**ALOA**, in Grecian Antiquity, a festival kept in honour of Ceres by the husbandmen, and supposed to resemble our harvest-home.\n\n**ALOE**, in Botany. See Botany Index.\n\nAmerican Aloe. See Agave, Botany Index.\n\n**ALOGIANS**, in Church History, a sect of ancient heretics, who denied that Jesus Christ was the Logos, and consequently rejected the gospel of St John. The word is compounded of the privative *a* and *λόγος*, q.d. Without Logos or Word. Some ascribe the origin of the name, as well as of the sect of Alogians, to Theodore of Byzantium, by trade a currier; who having apostatized under the persecution of the emperor Severus, to defend himself against those who reproached him therewith, said, that it was not God he denied, but only man. Whence his followers were called in Greek *άλογοι*, because they rejected the Word. But others, with more probability, suppose the name to have been first given them by Epiphanius in the way of reproach. They made their appearance toward the close of the second century.\n\n**ALOGOTROPHIA**, among Physicians, a term signifying the unequal growth or nourishment of any part of the body, as in the rickets.\n\n**ALOOF**, has frequently been mentioned as a term; but whether justly or not, we shall not presume to determine. It is known in common discourse to imply at a distance; and the resemblance of the phrase \"keep aloof,\" and keep a *luff*, or keep the *luff*, in all probability gave rise to this conjecture. If it was really a\nALPESE sea-phrase originally, it seems to have referred to the dangers of a lee-shore, in which situation the pilot might naturally apply it in the sense commonly understood, viz. keep all off, or quite off; it is, however, never expressed in that manner by seamen now. See LUFF.\n\nIt may not be improper to observe, that besides using this phrase in the same sense with us, the French also call the weather-side of a ship, and the weather-clue of a course, le lof.\n\nALOPECE, ALOPECIA, in Ancient Geography, an island placed by Ptolemy at the mouth of the Tanais, and called the island Tanais: now l'isle des Renards (Baudrandt).

It is directed to wash the head every night at going to bed with a ley prepared by boiling the ashes of vine branches in red wine. A powder made by reducing hermodactyls to fine flour is also recommended for the same purpose.\n\nIn cases where the baldness is total, a quantity of the finest burdock roots are to be bruised in a marble mortar, and then boiled in white wine until there remains only as much as will cover them. This liquor, carefully strained off, is said to cure baldness, by washing the head every night with some of it warm. A ley made by boiling ashes of vine branches in common water is also recommended with this intention. A fresh cut onion, rubbed on the part until it be red and itch, is likewise said to cure baldness.\n\nA multitude of such remedies are everywhere to be found in the works of Valescus de Taranta, Rondeletius, Hollerius, Trincavellius, Celsius, Senertay, and other practical physicians.\n\nALOPECURUS, or FOXTAIL-GRASS.

He was the friend of Erasmus, and wrote his epitaph. Alost was taken and dismantled by Marshal Turenne in 1667; and after the battle of Ramillies in 1706, was abandoned to the allies. E. Long. 3° 56'. N. Lat. 49° 35'.\n\nALP ARSLAN, the second sultan of the dynasty of Seljuk in Persia, was the son of David, and great grandson of Seljuk the founder of the dynasty. He Alp Arslan, was born in the year 1039, of the Hegira 421. In place of Ibrahîm, which was his original name, he assumed that of Mohammed, when he embraced the Muslim faith, and he obtained the surname, Alp Arslan, which in the Turkish language signifies a valiant lion, on account of his military prowess. Having held the chief command in Khorasan for ten years as lieutenant of his uncle Toghrul Beg, he succeeded him in the year 1063, and at the commencement of his reign saw himself sole monarch of Persia, from the river Amu to the Tigris. When he assumed the reins of government, faction and open rebellion prevailed in his dominions, in subduing of which he was ably assisted by Nadham al Molk his vizir, one of the most distinguished characters of his time, whose prudence and integrity in the administration of the affairs of the kingdom proved of most essential service to this prince and to his successor. Peace and security being established in his dominions, he convoked an assembly of the states; and having declared his son Malek Shaw his heir and successor, seated him on a throne of gold, and exacted an oath of fidelity to him from the principal officers of the empire. With the hope of acquiring immense booty in the rich temple of St Basil in Caesarea, the capital of Cappadocia, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the Euphrates, and entered and plundered that city. He then marched into Armenia and Georgia, which in the year 1065 he finally conquered. In the former country, the very name of a kingdom and the spirit of a nation were totally extinguished. But the native Georgians who had retired to the woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus made a more vigorous resistance. They too, however, overpowered by the arms of the sultan and his son Malek, were forced to submission, and reduced to slavery. To punish them for the brave defence which they had made, and as a badge of their humiliating condition, Alp Arslan obliged them to wear at their ears huge thorns of iron. Some, to escape this mark of cruelty and ignominy, professed to embrace the religion of Mahomet.\n\nIn the year 1068 Alp Arslan invaded the Roman empire, the seat of which was then at Constantinople. Eudocia, the reigning empress, saw and dreaded the progress of his arms. To avert the threatened danger, she married Romanus Diogenes, a brave soldier, who was accordingly associated with her in the government, and raised to the imperial dignity. The new emperor, during the exhausted state of their resources, sustained the Roman power with surprising valour and invincible courage. His spirit and success animated his soldiers in the field to act with fortitude and firmness, inspired his subjects with hope, and struck terror in his enemies. In three severe campaigns his arms were victorious; and the Turks were forced to retreat beyond the Euphrates. In the fourth he advanced with an army of 100,000 men into the Armenian territory for the relief of that country. Here he was met by Alp Arslan with 40,000 cavalry, or, according to some authors, a much smaller number; and the sultan having proposed terms of peace which were insultingly rejected by the emperor, a bloody and decisive engagement took place. Alp Arslan, it is said, when he saw that a battle was inevitable, wept at the thought that so many of his faithful followers must fall in\nAlp Arlan, in the struggle; and after offering up a devout prayer, granted free permission to all who chose it to retire from the field. Then with his own hand he tied up his horse's tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and scimitar, and robed himself in a white garment perfumed with musk, resolved to perish on the spot unless he came off victorious. The skilful movements of the Turkish cavalry soon made an impression on the superior numbers of the Greeks, who were thrown into great disorder, and after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed. Romanus, deserted by the main body of his army, with unshaken courage kept his station, till he was recognized by a slave, taken prisoner, and conducted into the presence of Alp Arlan. In the Turkish divan, the captive emperor was commanded to kiss the ground as a degrading mark of submission to the power and authority of the sultan, who, it is said, leapt from his throne and set his foot on his neck. But this is scarcely probable or consistent with the generous and respectful treatment which he otherwise experienced. For the sultan instantly raised him from the ground, embraced him tenderly, and assured him that his life and dignity should remain inviolate under the protection of a prince who had not forgotten the respect due to the majesty of his equals, and the vicissitudes of fortune. When the terms of his ransom were about to be settled, Romanus was asked by Alp Arlan what treatment he expected to receive. To this question the emperor, with seeming indifference, replied, \"If you are cruel, you will take my life; if you follow the dictates of pride, you will drag me at your chariot wheels; if you consult your interest, you will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.\" \"But what?\" says the sultan, \"would you have done in such circumstances?\" \"Had I been victorious,\" said the insolent Romanus, \"I would have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.\" The conqueror smiled at the fierce and unsubdued spirit of his captive; observed that the Christian precepts strongly inculcated the love of enemies and the forgiveness of injuries; and, with a noble greatness of mind, declared that he would never imitate an example which he disapproved. A ransom of a million, an annual tribute of 3000 pieces of gold, an intermarriage between the families, and the deliverance of all the captive Muslims in the power of the Greeks, were at last agreed to as the terms of peace and the liberty of the emperor. Romanus was now dismissed loaded with presents, and respectfully attended by a military guard. But the distracted state of his dominions, the consequence of a revolt of his subjects, precluded him from fulfilling the terms of the treaty, and remitting the stipulated price of his ransom. The sultan seemed disposed to favour and support the declining fortunes of his ally; but the defeat, imprisonment, and death of Romanus interrupted the accomplishment of his generous, or rather ambitious, design.\n\nAt this time the dominion of Alp Arlan extended over the fairest part of Asia; 1200 princes, sons of princes, surrounded his throne; and 200,000 soldiers were ready to execute his commands. He now meditated a greater enterprise, and declared his purpose of attempting the conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of his ancestors. After great preparations for the expedition, he marched with a powerful army, and arrived at the banks of the Oxus. Before he could pass the river with safety, it was necessary to gain possession of some fortresses in its vicinity; one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor, Joseph Cothul, a Circassian. He was, however, obliged to surrender, and was carried a prisoner before the sultan, who, being enraged at his obstinacy and presumption, addressed him in very reproachful terms. Joseph replied with so much spirit, that he roused the resentment of Alp Arlan, and was commanded instantly to be fastened by the hands and feet to four stakes, to suffer a painful and cruel death. Joseph, on hearing this sentence, became furious and desperate; and drawing a dagger which he had concealed in his boots, rushed towards the throne to stab the sultan; the guards raised their battle-axes, and moved forward to defend their sovereign; but Alp Arlan, the most expert archer of his age, checking their zeal, forbade them to advance, and drew his bow; his foot slipped, and the arrow missed Joseph, who rushed forward, and plunging his dagger in the breast of the sultan, was himself instantly cut in pieces. The wound proved mortal, and the sultan expired in a few hours after he received it, in the year 1072. When he found his end approaching, he addressed himself in these words to his attendants: \"In my youth,\" said he, \"I was advised by a wise man to humble myself before God, never to confide in my own strength, or to despise the most contemptible enemy. These lessons I have neglected, for which I have now met deserved punishment. Yesterday, when I beheld from an eminence the number and discipline of my troops, I said in the confidence of my heart, 'What power on earth can oppose me? what man dares to attack me?' To-day, vainly trusting to my own strength and dexterity, I foolishly checked the prompt zeal and alacrity of my guards for my safety, and now I have fallen by the hand of an afflatus! But I perceive that no force or address can resist fate.\" He died in the 10th year of his reign, at the age of 44. He was buried at Maru, one of the four cities of Khorasan, in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty. On his tomb was inscribed the following epitaph: \"All you who have beheld the grandeur of Alp Arlan exalted to the heavens, come to Maru, and you will see it buried in the dust.\"\n\nThis prince was distinguished for his valour, liberality, and piety. He was patient, just, and sincere. His stature, aspect, and voice, commanded the respect of all who approached him. He had long whiskers, and usually wore a high turban in the form of a crown. He was succeeded by his son Malek Shaw, who had been proclaimed and acknowledged sultan of the Turks during his life. (Mod. Univ. Hist. Gibbon's Hist.)\n\nALPHA, the name of the first letter of the Greek alphabet, answering to our A. As a numeral, it stands for one, or the first of any thing. It is particularly used, among ancient writers, to denote the chief or first man of his class or rank. In this sense, the word stands contradistinguished from beta, which denotes the second person. Plato was called the Alpha of the wits: Eratosthenes, keeper of the Alexandrian library, whom some called a Second Plato, is frequently named Beta.\n\nAlpha is also used to denote the beginning of any thing. In which sense it stands opposed to omega, which\nAlphabet, which denotes the end. And these two letters were made the symbol of Christianity; and accordingly were engraven on the tombs of the ancient Christians, to distinguish them from those of idolaters. Moralez, a Spanish writer, imagined that this custom only commenced since the rise of Arianism; and that it was peculiar to the orthodox, who hereby made confession of the eternity of Christ; but there are tombs prior to the age of Constantine whereon the two letters were found, besides that the emperor just mentioned bore them on his labarum before Arius appeared.\n\nALPHABET, the natural or customary series of the several letters of a language (see LANGUAGE and WRITING). The word is formed from alpha and beta, the first and second letters of the Greek alphabet. The number of letters is different in the alphabets of different languages. The English alphabet contains 24 letters; to which if we add j and v consonant, the sum will be 26; the French contains 23; the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Samaritan 22 each; the Arabic 28; the Persian 31; the Turkish 33; the Georgian 36; the Coptic 32; the Mufcorite 43; the Greek 24; the Latin 22; the Sclavonic 27; the Dutch 26; the Spanish 27; the Italian 20; the Ethiopic and Tartarian, each 20; the Indians of Bengal 21; the Baramele 19. The Chinese have, properly speaking, no alphabet, except we call their whole language by that name; their letters are words, or rather hieroglyphics, amounting to about 80,000.\n\nIt has been a matter of considerable dispute whether the method of expressing our ideas by visible symbols called letters be really a human invention; or whether we ought to attribute an art so exceedingly useful to an immediate revelation from the Deity.—In favour of the latter opinion it has been urged,\n\n1. The five books of Moses are universally acknowledged to be the most ancient compositions as well as the most early specimens of alphabetical writing we have. If, therefore, we suppose writing to be the result of human ingenuity, it must be different from all other arts, having been brought to perfection at once; as it seems impossible to make any real improvement on the Hebrew alphabet. It may indeed be replied, that alphabetical characters perhaps have existed many ages before the writings of Moses, though the more ancient specimens have perished. This, however, being a mere unsupported assertion, without any historical testimony to corroborate it, cannot be admitted as a proof. Again, Setting aside the evidence to be derived from Scripture on this subject, the simplicity of manners predominant in the early ages, the small extent of the intellectual powers of mankind, and the little intercourse which nations had with one another, which would seem more particularly to render writing necessary, can scarcely allow us to suppose that such a complex and curious contrivance as alphabetical writing could be invented by a race of men whose wants were so few, their advantages so circumscribed, and their ideas so limited.\n\n2. If alphabetical writing were a mere human invention, it might be expected that different nations would have fallen upon the same expedient independent of each other during the compass of so many ages. But no such thing has taken place; and the writing of every people on earth may be referred to one common original. If this can be proved, the argument from Alphabet, successive derivation, without a single instance of independent discovery, must be allowed to amount to the very highest degree of probability in favour of our hypothesis, which will now rest on the evidence for or against this fact; and which may be summed up in the following manner.\n\nAmong the European nations we find none who can pretend any right to the discovery of letters. All of them derived the art from the Romans, excepting only the Turks, who had it from the Arabians. The Romans never laid claim to the discovery; but confessed that they derived their knowledge from the Greeks, and the latter owned that they had it from the Phoenicians; who, as well as their colonists the Carthaginians, spoke a dialect of the Hebrew scarcely varying from the original. The Coptic, or Egyptian, resembles the Greek in most of its characters, and is therefore to be referred to the same original. The Chaldee, Syriac, and latter Samaritan, are dialects of the Hebrew, without any considerable deviation, or many additional words. The Ethiopic differs more from the Hebrew, but less than the Arabic; yet these languages have all issued from the same stock, as the similarity of their formation, and the numberless words common to them, all sufficiently evince; and the Peric is very nearly allied to the Arabic. Alterations indeed would naturally be produced, in proportion to the civilization of the several nations, and their intercourse with others; which will account for the superior copiousness of some above the rest. It appears then, that all the languages in use amongst men that have been conveyed in alphabetical characters, have been the languages of people connected ultimately or immediately with the Hebrews, who have handed down the earliest specimens of writing to posterity; and we have therefore the greatest reason to believe, that their method of writing, as well as their language, was derived from the same source.\n\nThis proposition will be farther confirmed from considering the famelics of the artificial denominations of the letters in the Oriental, Greek, and Latin languages, accompanied also by a similar arrangement, as alpha, beta, &c. It may still be objected, however, that the characters employed by the ancients to discriminate their letters are entirely dissimilar. Why should not one nation, it may be urged, adopt from the other the mode of expressing the art as well as the art itself? To what purpose did they take the trouble of inventing other characters? To this objection it may be replied, 1. From the influence of our own language we know what diversities may be introduced in this respect merely by length of time and an intercourse with neighbouring nations. And such an effect would be more likely to take place before the art of printing had contributed to establish an uniformity of character: For when every work was transcribed by the hand, we may easily imagine how many variations would arise from the fancy of the scribe, and the mode of writing so constantly different in individuals. 2. This diversity might sometimes arise from vanity. When an individual of another community had become acquainted with this wonderful art, he might endeavour to recommend himself as the inventor; and, to avoid detection, might invent other characters. 3. The char-\nracters of the alphabet might sometimes be accommodated as much as possible to the symbolical marks already in use amongst a particular people. These having acquired a high degree of sanctity by the use of many generations, would not easily be superseded without the aid of some such contrivance. 4. This is supported by the testimony of Herodotus; who informs us, \"that those Phoenicians who came with Cadmus introduced many improvements among the Greeks, and alphabetical writing too, not known among them before that period. At first they used the Phoenician character; but in process of time, as the pronunciation altered, the standard of the letters was also changed. The Ionian Greeks inhabited at the time the parts adjacent to Phoenicia: who having received the art of alphabetical writing from the Phoenicians, used it, with an alteration of some few characters, and confessed ingenuously, that it was called Phoenician from the introducers of it.\" He tells us that he had himself seen the characters of Cadmus in the temple of Iphigenia Apollo at Thebes in Boeotia, engraven upon tripods, and very much resembling the Ionian characters.\n\n5. The old Samaritan is precisely the same as the Hebrew language: and the Samaritan Pentateuch does not vary by a single letter in twenty words from the Hebrew: but the characters are widely different: for the Jews adopted the Chaldaic letters during their captivity at Babylon instead of the characters of their forefathers.\n\n3. What we know of those nations who have continued for many centuries unconnected with the rest of the world, strongly militates against the hypothesis of the human invention of alphabetical writing. The experiment has been fairly made upon the ingenuity of mankind for a longer period than that which is supposed to have produced alphabetical writing by regular gradations; and this experiment determines peremptorily in their favour. The Chinese, a people famous for their discoveries and mechanical turn of genius, have made some advances towards the delineation of their ideas by arbitrary signs, but have nevertheless been unable to accomplish this exquisite device; and after so long a trial to no purpose, we may reasonably infer, that their mode of writing, which is growing more intricate and voluminous every day, would never terminate in so clear, so comparatively simple, an expedient as that of alphabetical characters. The Mexicans, too, had made some rude attempts of the same kind; but with less success than the Chinese. We know also, that hieroglyphics were in use among the Egyptians posterior to the practice of alphabetical writing by the Jews; but whether the epigraphy, as it is called, of the former people, which was in vogue during the continuance of the hieroglyphics, might not possibly be another name for alphabetical writing, cannot be decided.\n\n4. We shall consider the argument on which the commonly received supposition entirely depends: that is, the natural gradation, through the several species of symbols acknowledged to have been in use with various people, terminating at last, by an easy transition, in the detection of alphabetical characters. The strength of this argument will be best understood from the following representation.\n\n1. The first method of embodying ideas would be by drawing a representation of the objects themselves. The imperfection of this method is very obvious, both on account of its tediousness and its inability of going beyond external appearances to the abstract ideas of the mind.\n\n2. The next method would be somewhat more general, and would substitute two or three principal circumstances for the whole transaction. So two kings, for example, engaging each other with military weapons, might serve to convey the idea of a war between the two nations. This abbreviated method would be more expeditious than the former; but what it gained in conciseness would be lost in perspicuity. It is a description more compendious indeed, but still a description of outward objects alone, by drawing their resemblance. To this head may be referred the picture-writing of the Mexicans.\n\n3. The next advance would be to the use of symbols; the incorporation, as it were, of abstract and complex ideas in figures more or less generalized, in proportion to the improvement of it. Thus, in the earlier stages of this device, a circle might serve to express the sun, a semicircle the moon; which is only a contraction of the foregoing method. This symbol writing in its advanced state would become more refined, but enigmatical and mysterious in proportion to its refinement. Hence it would become less fit for common use, and therefore more particularly appropriated to the mysteries of philosophy and religion. Thus, two feet standing upon water served to express an impossibility; a serpent denoted the oblique trajectories of the heavenly bodies; and the beetle, on account of some supposed properties of that insect, served to represent the sun. The Egyptian hieroglyphics were of this kind.\n\n4. This method being still too subtle and complicated for common use, the only plan to be pursued was a reduction of the first stage of the preceding method. Thus a dot, instead of a circle, might stand for the sun; and a similar abbreviation might be extended to all the symbols. On this scheme every object and idea would have its appropriated mark: these marks, therefore, would have a multiplicity proportionable to the works of nature and the operations of the mind. This method was likewise practised by the Egyptians; but has been carried to greater perfection by the Chinese. The vocabulary of the latter is therefore infinite, or at least capable of being extended to any imaginable length. But if we compare this tedious and awkward contrivance with the astonishing brevity and perspicuity of alphabetical writing, we must be persuaded that no two things can be more dissimilar; and that the transition from a scheme constantly enlarging itself, and growing daily more intricate, to the expression of every possible idea by the modified arrangement of four-and-twenty marks, is not so very easy and perceptible as some have imagined. Indeed this seems still to be rather an expression of things in a manner similar to the second stage of symbol writing than the notification of ideas by arbitrary signs.\"\n\nTo all this we shall subjoin the following remarks, which seem to give additional force to the foregoing reasoning.\n\n1. Pliny asserts the use of letters to have been eternal;\nwhich shows the antiquity of the practice to extend beyond the era of authentic history.\n\n2. The cabalistical doctors of the Jews maintain, that alphabetical writing was one of the ten things which God created on the evening of the Sabbath.\n\n3. Most of the profane authors of antiquity ascribe the first use of alphabetical characters to the Egyptians, who, according to some, received them from Mercury; and, according to others, from their god Teuth.\n\n4. There is very little reason to suppose that even language itself is the effect of human ingenuity and invention.\"\n\nThus we have stated the arguments in favour of the revelation of alphabetical writing; which are answered, by those who take the contrary side, in the following manner.\n\n1. Moses nowhere says that the alphabet was a new thing in his time; nor does he give the least hint of his being the inventor of it. The first mention we find of writing is in the 17th chapter of Exodus; where Moses is commanded to write in a book; and which took place before the arrival of the Israelites at Sinai. This shows that writing did not commence with the delivery of the two tables of the law, as some have supposed. Neither are we to conclude that the invention had taken place only a short time before; for the writing in a book is commanded as a thing commonly understood, and with which Moses was well acquainted. It is plain, from the command to engrave the names of the twelve tribes of Israel upon stones like the engravings of a signet, that writing had been known and practised among them, as well as other nations, long before. We must also remember, that the people were commanded to write the law on their door posts, &c. so that the art seems not only to have been known, but universally practised among them. But had writing been a new discovery in the time of Moses, he would probably have commemorated it as well as the other inventions of music, &c. Nor is there any reason to suppose that God was the immediate revealer of the art; for Moses would never have omitted to record a circumstance of such importance, as the memory of it would have been one of the strongest barriers against idolatry.\n\nAgain, though several profane writers attribute the origin of letters to the gods, or to some divine person, yet this is no proof of its being actually revealed; but only that the original inventor was unknown. The learned bishop of Gloucester observes, that the ancients gave nothing to the gods of whose original they had any records; but where the memory of the invention was lost, as of seed-corn, wine, writing, civil society, &c. the gods seized the property, by that kind of right which gives stays to the lord of the manor.\n\nAs neither the sacred nor profane historians, therefore, have determined anything concerning the invention of letters, we are at liberty to form what conjectures we think most plausible concerning the origin of them; and this, it is thought, might have taken place in the following manner.\n\n1. Men, in their rude uncultivated state, would have neither leisure, inclination, nor inducement, to cultivate the powers of the mind to a degree sufficient for the formation of an alphabet; but when a people arrived at such a pitch of civilization as required them to represent the conceptions of the mind which have no corporeal forms, necessity would occasion further exertions, and urge them to find out a more expeditious manner of transacting their business than by picture-writing.\n\n2. These exertions would take place whenever a nation began to improve in arts, manufactures, and commerce; and the greater genius such a nation had, the more improvements would be made in the notation of their language; whilst those people who had made less progress in civilization and science, would have a less perfect system of elementary characters; and perhaps advance no farther for many ages than the marks or characters of the Chinese. Hence we may see, that the business of princes, as well as the manufactures and commerce of each country, would produce the necessity of devising some expeditious manner of communicating information to one another.\n\nThe art of writing, however, is of so great antiquity, and the early history of most nations so full of fable, that it must be extremely difficult to determine what nation or people may justly claim the honour of the invention. But as it is probable that letters were the produce of a certain degree of civilization among mankind, we must therefore have recourse to the history of those nations who seem to have been first civilized.\n\nThe Egyptians have an undoubted title to a very Claim of early civilization; and many learned men have attributed the invention of letters to them. The late bishop of Gloucester contends, that Egypt was the parent of all the learning of Greece, and was referred to by all the Grecian legislators, naturalists, and philosophers; and endeavours to prove that it was one of the first civilized countries on the globe. Their writing was of four kinds: 1. Hieroglyphic; 2. Symbolic; 3. Epitaphic; and, 4. Hierogrammatic. In the most early ages they wrote, like all other infant nations, by pictures; of which some traces yet remain amongst the hieroglyphics of Horapollo, who informs us, that they represented a fuller by a man's two feet in water; fire, by smoke ascending, &c. But to render this rude invention less inconvenient, they soon devised the method of putting one thing of similar qualities for another.\n\nThe former was called the curiologic, the latter the tropical hieroglyphic; which last was a gradual improvement on the former. These alterations in the manner of delineating hieroglyphic figures produced and perfected another character, called the running-hand of the hieroglyphics, resembling the Chinese writing; which having been first formed by the outlines of each figure, became at length a kind of marks; the natural effects of which were, that the constant use of them would take off the attention from the symbol and fix it on the thing signified. Thus the study of symbolic writing would be much abbreviated; because the writer or decipherer would have then little to do but to remember the power of the symbolic mark; whereas before, the properties of the thing or animal delineated were to be learned. This, together with the other marks by institution, to denote mental conceptions, would reduce the characters to a similar state with the present Chinese; and these were properly what the ancients called hieroglyphical. We are informed by Dr Robert Huntingdon, in his account of the Porphyry pillars,\nThe sacred book or ritual of the Egyptians, according to Apuleius, was written partly in symbolic and partly in these hieroglyphic characters, in the following manner: \"He (the hierophant) drew out certain books from the secret repositories of the sanctuary, written in unknown characters, which contained the words of the sacred formula compendiously expressed, partly by figures of animals, and partly by certain marks or notes intricately knotted, revolving in the manner of a wheel, crowded together, and curled inward like the tendrils of a vine, so as to hide the meaning from the curiosity of the profane.\"\n\nBut though letters were of great antiquity in Egypt, there is reason to believe that they were not first invented in that country. Mr Jackson, in his Chronological Antiquities, has endeavoured to prove, that they were not invented or carried into Egypt by Taaut or Thoth, the first Hermes, and son of Misfram, who lived about 300 years after the deluge; but that they were introduced into that country by the second Hermes, who lived about 400 years after the former. This second Hermes, according to Diodorus, was the inventor of grammar and music, and added many words to the Egyptian language. According to the same author also, he invented letters, rhythm, and the harmony of sounds. This was the Hermes so much celebrated by the Greeks, who knew no other than himself. On the other hand, Mr Wile affirms that Moses and Cadmus could not learn the alphabet in Egypt; and that the Egyptians had no alphabet in their time. He adduces several reasons to prove that they had none till they received what was called the Coptic, which was introduced either in the time of the Ptolemies or under Plammitichus or Amasis; and the oldest alphabetic letters which can be produced as Egyptian, appear plainly to have been derived from the Greek. Herodotus confesses, that all he relates before the reign of Plammitichus is uncertain; and that he reports the early transactions of that nation on the credit of the Egyptian priests, on which he did not greatly depend; and Diodorus Siculus is said to have been greatly imposed upon by them. Manetho, the oldest Egyptian historian, translated the sacred registers out of Egyptian into Greek, which are said by Synecus to have been written in the sacred letters, and to have been laid up by the second Mercury in the Egyptian temples. He allows the Egyptian gods to have been mortal men; but his history was very much corrupted by the Greeks, and hath been called in question by several writers from the account which he himself gave of it. After Cambyses had carried away the Egyptian records, the priests, to supply their loss, and to keep up their pretensions to antiquity, began to write new records; wherein they not only unavoidably made great mistakes, but added much of their own invention, especially as to distant times.\n\nThe Phoenicians have likewise been supposed the inventors of letters; and we have the strongest proofs of the early civilization of this people. Their most ancient historian, Sanchoniatho, lived in the time of Abibalus, father of Hiram king of Tyre. He informs us, that letters were invented by Taaut, who lived in Phoenicia in the 12th and 13th generations after the creation. \"Milon (says he) was the son of Hamyn; the son of Misfr was Taaut, who invented the first letters for writing.\" The Egyptians call him Thoth; the Alexandrians Thoyth; and the Greeks Hermes, or Mercury. In the time of this Taaut or Mercury, (the grandson of Ham the son of Noah,) Phoenicia and the adjacent country was governed by Uranus, and after him by his son Saturn or Cronus. He invented letters either in the reign of Uranus or Cronus; and itaid in Phoenicia with Cronus till the 32d year of his reign. Cronus, after the death of his father Uranus, made several settlements of his family, and travelled into other parts; and when he came to the south country, he gave all Egypt to the god Taautus, that it should be his kingdom. Sanchoniatho began his history with the creation, and ended it with placing Taautus on the throne of Egypt. He does not mention the deluge, but makes two more generations in Cain's line from Protagonus to Agrovenus (or from Adam to Noah than Moses. As Sanchoniatho has not told us whether Taaut invented letters either in the reign of Uranus or Cronus, \"we cannot err much (says Mr Jackson) if we place his invention of them 550 years after the flood, or 20 years after the dispersion, and 2619 years before the Christian era, and fix, or perhaps ten years, before he went into Egypt.\" This prince and his posterity reigned at Thebes in Upper Egypt for 15 generations.\n\nSeveral Roman authors attribute the invention of letters to the Phoenicians. Pliny says (A), the Phoenicians were famed for the invention of letters, as well as for astronomical observations and novel and martial arts. Curtius informs us, that the Tyrian nation are related to be the first who either taught or learned letters; and Lucan says, that they were the first who attempted to express sounds or words by letters. Eusebius also tells us from Porphyry, that \"Sanchoniatho studied with great application the writings of Taaut, knowing that he was the first who invented letters.\"\n\nThe Greeks, as we have already observed, knew no older Hermes than the second, who lived about 400 years after the Mezrite Taaut or Hermes. This second Hermes is called by Plato Thoeuth, and counsellor or sacred scribe to King Thanus; but it is not said that he ever reigned in Egypt: but the former Taaut, or Athothes, as Manetho calls him, was the immediate successor of Menes the first king of Egypt. This second Mercury, if we may believe Manetho, composed several books of the Egyptian history, and having improved both the language and letters of that nation, the Egyptians attributed the arts and inventions of the former to the latter. The Phoenician language is generally allowed to have been a dialect of the Hebrew; and though their alphabet does not entirely agree with the\n\n(4) He says in another place, that the knowledge of letters is eternal. What dependence can we put in the opinion of a writer who thus contradicts himself?\nthe Samaritan, yet there is a great similarity between them. Astronomy and arithmetic were much cultivated among them in the most early ages; their fine linen, purple, and glass, were much superior to those of other nations; and their extraordinary skill in architecture and other arts was such, that whatever was great, elegant, or pleasing, whether in buildings, apparel, or toys, was distinguished by the epithet of Tyrian or Sidonian; these being the chief cities of Phoenicia. Their great proficiency in learning and arts of all kinds, together with their engrossing all the commerce of the western world, are likewise thought to give them a just claim to the invention of letters.\n\nThe Chaldeans also have laid claim to the invention of letters; and with regard to this, there is a tradition among the Jews, Indians, and Arabians, that the Egyptians derived their knowledge from Abraham, who was a Chaldean. This tradition is in some degree confirmed by most of the western writers, who ascribe the inventions of arithmetic and astronomy to the Chaldeans. Josephus positively affirms, that the Egyptians were ignorant of the sciences of arithmetic and astronomy before they were instructed by Abraham; and Sir Isaac Newton admits, that letters were known in the line of that patriarch for many centuries before Moses. The Chaldaic letters appear to have been derived from the Hebrew or Samaritan; which are the same, or nearly so, with the old Phoenician. Ezra is supposed to have exchanged the old Hebrew characters for the more beautiful and commodious Chaldee, which are still in use. Berossus, the most ancient Chaldean historian, who was born in the minority of Alexander the Great, does not say that he believed his countrymen to have been the inventors of letters.\n\nThe Syrians have also laid claim to the invention of letters. It is certain indeed, that they yielded to no nation in knowledge and skill in the fine arts. Their language is said to have been the vernacular of all the oriental tongues, and was divided into three dialects. 1. The Aramean, used in Mesopotamia, and by the inhabitants of Roha and Edefa of Harram, and the Outer Syria. 2. The dialect of Palestine; spoken by the inhabitants of Damascus, Mount Lebanon, and the Inner Syria. 3. The Chaldee or Nabatean dialect, the most polished of the three; and spoken in the mountainous parts of Assyria, and the villages of Irac or Babylonia. It has been generally believed, that no nation of equal antiquity had a more considerable trade than the Syrians; they are supposed to have first brought the commodities of Persia and India into the west of Asia; and they seem to have carried on an inland trade by engrossing the navigation of the Euphrates, whilst the Phoenicians traded to the most distant countries. Notwithstanding these circumstances, however, which might seem to favour the claim of the Syrians, the oldest characters they have are but about three centuries before Christ. Their letters are of two sorts. 1. The Estrangelo, which is the more ancient; and, 2. The Fhito, the simple or common character, which is the more expeditious and beautiful.\n\nWe must next examine the claims of the Indians, whose pretensions to antiquity yield to no other nation on earth. Mr Halhed, who has written a grammar of the Sanskrit language, informs us, that it is not only the grand source of Indian literature, but the parent of almost every dialect from the Persian gulf to the Chinese seas, and which is said to be a language of the most venerable antiquity. At present it is appropriated to religious records of the Brahmans, and therefore shut up in their libraries; but formerly it appears to have been current over the greatest part of the eastern world, as traces of its extent may be found in almost every district of Asia.\n\nMr Halhed informs us, that \"there is a great similarity between the Sanskrit words and those of the Persian and Arabic, and even of Latin and Greek; and these not in technical or metaphorical terms, but in the main groundwork of language; in monosyllables, the names of numbers, and the appellations of such things as would be first discriminated on the immediate dawn of civilization. The resemblance which may be seen of the characters on the medals and signs of different parts of Asia, the light they reciprocally throw upon one another, and the general analogy which they all bear to the grand prototype, affords another ample field for curiosity. The coins of Assam, Nipal, Cashmiria, and many other kingdoms, are all stamped with Sanskrit letters, and mostly contain allusions to the old Sanskrit mythology. The same conformity may be observed in the impressions of seals from Bootan and Thibet.\"\n\nThe country between the Indus and Ganges still preserves the Sanskrit language in its original purity, and offers a great number of books to the perusal of the curious; many of which have been handed down from the earliest periods of human civilization.\n\nThere are seven different sorts of Indian hand-writings, all comprised under the general term of Naagoree, which may be interpreted writing. The Brahmans say that letters were of divine origin; and the elegant Sanskrit is styled Dael-naagoree, or the writings of the Immortals, which might not improbably be a refinement from the more simple Naagoree of former ages. The Bengal letters are another branch of the same stock. The Brahmans of Bengal have all their Sanskrit books copied in their national alphabet, and they transcribe into them all the Dael-naagoree manuscripts for their own perusal. The Moorish dialect is that species of Hindustanic which we owe to the conquests of the Mahometans.\n\nThe Sanskrit language contains about 700 radical words; the fundamental part being divided into three classes, viz. 1. Dhata, or roots of verbs; 2. Shubd, or original nouns; 3. Etya, or particles. Their alphabet contains 50 letters; viz. 34 consonants and 16 vowels. They assert that they were in possession of letters before any other nation in the world; and Mr Halhed conjectures, that the long boasted original civilization of the Egyptians may still be a matter of dispute. The rajah of Kishinagar affirms, that he has in his possession Sanskrit books, where the Egyptians are constantly described as disciples, not as instructors; and as seeking in Hindostan that liberal education, and those sciences, which none of their own countrymen had sufficient knowledge to impart. Mr Halhed hints also, that the learning of Hindostan might have been transplanted into Egypt, and thus have become familiar to Moses. Several authors, however, are of opinion, that the ancient Egyptians possessed themselves of the trade of the East by the Red sea, and that they carried\ncarried on a considerable traffic with the Indian nations before the time of Sesostris; whom they suppose to have been contemporary with Abraham, though Sir Isaac Newton conjectures him to have been the Shihak who took Jerusalem in the time of Rehoboam.\n\nIn the year 1769, one of the sacred books of the Gentoos called Bagavadam, translated by Meridas Poule, a learned man of Indian origin, and chief interpreter to the supreme council of Pondicherry, was sent by him to M. Bertin in France. In his preface he says, that it was composed by Vialfar the son of Brahma, and is of sacred authority among the worshippers of Vishnu. This book claims an antiquity of 5000 years; but M. de Guines has shown, that its pretensions to such extravagant antiquity are entirely inconclusive and unsatisfactory: whence we may conclude, says Mr. Ayle, that though a farther inquiry into the literature of the Indian nations may be laudable, yet we must by no means give too easy credit to their relations concerning the high antiquity of their manuscripts and early civilization.\n\nIt is not pretended that the Persians had any great learning among them till the time of Hyrcanus the father of Darius. The former, we are told, travelled into India, and was instructed by the Brahmins in the sciences for which they were famed at that time. The ancient Persians despised riches and commerce, nor had they any money among them till after the conquest of Lydia. It appears by several inscriptions taken from the ruins of the palace of Persepolis, which was built near 700 years before the Christian era, that the Persians sometimes wrote in perpendicular columns like the Chinese. This mode of writing was first made use of on the items of trees, pillars, or obelisks. As for those simple characters found on the west side of the staircase of Persepolis, some have supposed them to be alphabetic, some hieroglyphic, and others antediluvian. Dr. Hyde pronounces them to have been mere whimsical ornaments, though the author of Conjectural Observations on Alphabetic Writing supposes them to be fragments of Egyptian antiquity brought by Cambyses from the spoils of Thebes. The learned are generally agreed, that the Persians were later in civilization than many of their neighbours; and they are not supposed to have any pretensions to the invention of letters.\n\nAs the Arabians have been in possession of the country they now inhabit for upwards of 3700 years, without being intermixed with foreign nations, or subjugated by any other power, their language must be very ancient. The two principal dialects of it were that spoken by the Hamyarites and other genuine Arabs; and that of the Koreish, in which Mahomet wrote the Alcoran. The former is named by oriental writers, the Arabic of Hamyar; the latter, the pure or defected Arabic. Mr. Richardson observes, as a proof of the richness of this language, that it consists of 2000 radical words.\n\nThe old Arabic characters are said to have been of very high antiquity; for Ebn Hafhem relates, that an inscription in it was found in Yemen as old as the days of Joseph. Hence some have supposed, that the Arabians were the inventors of letters; and Sir Isaac Newton is of opinion, that Moses learned the alphabet from the Midianites, who were Arabians.\n\nThe alphabet of the Arabs consists of 28 letters similar to the ancient Cufic, in which the first copies of the Alcoran were written. The present Arabic characters were formed by Ebn Mokiah, a learned Arabian who lived about 300 years after Mahomet. The Arabian writers themselves inform us, that their alphabet is not very ancient, and that they received it only a short time before the introduction of Islamism.\n\nOn this account of the pretensions of different nations to the invention of letters, Mr. Ayle makes the following reflections: \"The vanity of each nation induces them to pretend to the most early civilization: but such is the uncertainty of ancient history, that it is difficult to determine to whom the honour is due. It should seem, however, that the contest may be confined to the Egyptians, the Phoenicians, and the Chaldeans. The Greek writers, and most of those who have copied them, decide in favour of Egypt, because their information is derived from the Egyptians themselves. The positive claim of the Phoenicians does not depend entirely upon the testimony of Sanchoniatho; the credibility of his history is so well supported by Philo of Byblus, Phoenicia's translator, Porphyry, Pliny, Curtius, Lucan, and other ancient writers, who might have seen his works entire, and whose relations deserve at least as much credit as those of the Egyptian and Greek writers. It must be allowed, that Sanchoniatho's history contains many fabulous accounts; but does not the ancient history of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and most other nations, abound with them to a much greater degree? The fragments which we have of this most ancient historian are chiefly furnished by Eusebius, who took all possible advantages to represent the Pagan writers in the worst light, and to render their theology absurd and ridiculous.\n\n\"The Phoenician and Egyptian languages are very similar; but the latter is said to be more large and full, which is an indication of its being of a later date. The opinion of Mr. Wile, however, that the ancient Egyptians had not the knowledge of letters, seems to be erroneous; as they had commercial intercourse with their neighbours the Phoenicians, they probably had the knowledge of letters, if their policy, like that of the Chinese at this day, did not prohibit the use of them.\n\n\"The Chaldeans, who cultivated astronomy in the most remote ages, used symbols or arbitrary marks in their calculations; and we have shewn that these were the parents of letters. This circumstance greatly favours their claim to the invention: because Chaldea, and the countries adjacent, are allowed by all authors, both sacred and profane, to have been peopled before Egypt; and it is certain, that many nations said to be descended from Shem and Japheth, had their letters from the Phoenicians, who were descended from Ham.\n\n\"It is observable that the Chaldeans, the Syrians, Phoenicians, and Egyptians, all bordered upon each other; and as the Phoenicians were the greatest as well as the most ancient commercial nation, it is very probable that they communicated letters to the Egyptians, the ports of Tyre and Sidon being not far distant from each other.\n\n\"Mr. Jackson is evidently mistaken when he says that letters were invented 2619 years before the birth of Christ. The deluge recorded by Moses was 2349 years...\"\nyears before that event; and if letters were not invented till 550 years after, as he affirms, we must date their discovery only 1799 years before the Christian era, which is 410 years after the reign of Menes, the first king of Egypt, who, according to Syncellus and others, is said to have been the same person with the Mitor of Sanchoniatho, the Mizraim of the Scriptures, and the Osiris of the Egyptians; but whether this be true or not, Egypt is frequently called in Scripture the land of Mizraim.\n\nThis Mizraim, the second son of Amyn or Ham, seated himself near the entrance of Egypt at Zoan, in the year before Christ 2188, and 160 years after the flood. He afterwards built Thebes, and some say Memphis. Before the time that he went into Egypt, his son Taaut had invented letters in Phoenicia; and if this invention took place ten years before the migration of his father into Egypt, as Mr. Jackson supposes, we may trace letters as far back as the year 2178 before Christ, or 150 years after the deluge recorded by Moses; and beyond this period, the written annals of mankind, which have been hitherto transmitted to us, will not enable us to trace the knowledge of them; though this want of materials is no proof that letters were not known until a century and a half after the deluge. As for the pretensions of the Indian nations, we must be better acquainted with their records before we can admit of their claim to the first use of letters; especially as none of their manuscripts of any great antiquity have as yet appeared in Europe. That the Arabians were not the inventors of letters, has appeared by their own confession. Plato somewhere mentions Hyperborean letters very different from the Greek; these might have been the characters used by the Tartars, or ancient Scythians.\n\nIt may be expected that something should be said concerning those books mentioned by some authors to have been written before the deluge. Amongst others, Dr. Parsons, in his Remains of Japheth, p. 346, 359, supposes letters to have been known to Adam; and the Sabaeans produce a book, which they pretend was written by Adam. But concerning these we have no guide to direct us any more than concerning the supposed books of Enoch; some of which, Origen tells us, were found in Arabia Felix, in the dominions of the queen of Saba. Tertullian affirms, that he saw and read several pages of them; and, in his treatise De Habitui Mulierum, he places those books among the canonical; but St Jerome and St Austin look upon them to be apocryphal. William Pottellius pretended to compile his book, De Originibus, from the book of Enoch; and Thomas Bangius published at Copenhagen, in 1657, a work which contains many singular relations concerning the manner of writing among the Antediluvians, which contains several pleasant stories concerning the books of Enoch.\n\nWith regard to this patriarch, indeed, St Jude informs us that he prophesied, but he does not say that he wrote. The writings, therefore, attributed to the Antediluvians, must appear quite uncertain; though it might be improper to assert that letters were unknown before the deluge recorded by Moses.\n\nOur author proceeds to show, that all the alphabets in the world cannot be derived from one original; because there is a variety of alphabets used in different parts of Asia, which vary in name, number, figure, order, and power, from the Phoenician, ancient Hebrew, or Samaritan. In several of these alphabets also, there are marks for sounds peculiar to the language of each, which are not necessary to be employed in the notation of the languages of Europe.\n\nNone of the alphabets to the east of Persia have any connexion with the Phoenician or its derivatives, except where the Arabic letters have been introduced by the conquests of the Mahometans. The foundation of all the Indian characters are those called Shanfcrir or Sungferir. This signifies something brought to perfection, in contradistinction to Prakrit, which signifies vulgar or unpolished. Hence the refined and religious language and characters of India are called Sungferir, and the more vulgar mode of writing and expression Prakrit. From this Shanfcrir are derived the sacred characters of Thibet, the Cashmirian, Bengalese, Malabarese, and Tamoul; the Singalese, Siamese, Maharattn, Concaneese, &c. From the same source we may derive the Tartaric or Tartar characters, which are similar in their great outlines to the Shanfcrir; though it is not easily determined which is derived from the other. The common Tartar is generally read, like the Chinese, from top to bottom.\n\nThere are, however, several alphabets used in different parts of Asia, entirely different not only from the Shanfcrir and all those derived from it, but also from the Phoenician and those which proceed from it. Some of these are the alphabet of Pegu, the Batna characters used in the island of Sumatra, and the Barman or Roman characters used in some parts of Pegu. The names and powers of the letters of which these alphabets are composed, differ entirely from the Phoenician, or those derived from them. It is impossible to assimilate their forms; and indeed it is by no means easy to conceive how the 50 letters of the Shanfcrir language could be derived from the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted originally only of 13; though it is certain, that by far the greater number of alphabets now in use are derived from the ancient Hebrew, Phoenician, or Samaritan.\n\nMr. Ashle next proceeds to consider what alphabets are derived from the Phoenician. These he supposes to have been immediately the ancient Hebrew or Samaritan; the Chaldaic; the Bafulian (a) or Spanish Phoenician; the Punic; Carthaginian, or Sicilian; and the Pelagian. From the ancient Hebrew proceeded the Chaldaic or square Hebrew; the round Hebrew; and what is called the running hand of the Rabbins. The Pelagian gave birth to the Etrurcan, Eugubian or Umbrian, Ofcan, Samnie, and Ionic Greek, written from the left. From the Chaldaic or square Hebrew are derived the Syriac, and the ancient and modern Arabic. The Syriac is divided into the Estrangelo and\n\n(a) The Bafuli are said to have been a Canaanitish or Phoenician people who fled from Joshua, and settled afterwards in Spain.\nAlphabet, and Mendelean, and the modern Arabic has given rise to the Persian and Turkish. From the ancient Arabic are derived the Cufic or Oriental, the Mauritanian or Occidental, the African or Saracen, and the Moorish. The Ionic Greek gave rise to the Arcadian, Latin, ancient Gaulish, ancient Spanish, ancient Gothic, Coptic, Ethiopic, Runic, Illyrian or Slavonic, Bulgarian, and Armenian. From the Roman are derived the Lombardic, Visigothic, Saxon, Gallican, Franco-Gallic or Merovingian, German, Caroline, Capetian, and modern Gothic.\n\nThe Punic letters are also called Tyrian, and were much the same with the Carthaginian or Sicilian. The Punic language was at first the same with the Phoenician; it is nearly allied to the Hebrew, and has an affinity with the Chaldee and Syriac. Some remains of it are to be met with in the Maltese. To make a complete Punic, Carthaginian, or Sicilian alphabet, we must admit several pure Phoenician letters.\n\nThe Pelagii were likewise of Phoenician origin; and, according to Sanchoniatho, the Dioecuri and Cabiri wrote the first annals of the Phoenician history, by order of Taaut, the inventor of letters. They made ships of burthen; and being cast upon the coast near Mount Cænus, about 40 miles from Pelusium, where they built a temple in the second generation after the deluge related by Moses, they were called Pelagii, from their passing by sea, and wandering from one country to another. Herodotus informs us, that the Pelagii were descendants of the Phoenician Cabiri, and that the Samothracians received and practised the Cabiric mysteries from them. The Pelagian alphabet prevailed in Greece till the time of Deucalion, when the Pelagii were driven out of Thessaly or Oenotria by the Hellenes; after which some of them settled at the mouth of the Po, and others at Croton, now Cortona in Tuscany. Their alphabet consisted of 16 letters, and the Tyrrhenian alphabet, brought into Italy before the reign of that prince consisted of no more than 13. Deucalion is said to have reigned about 820 years after the deluge, and 1529 before the Christian era.\n\nThat the Tyrrheni, Tyrfeni or Hetrufi, settled in Italy long before this period, appears from the testimony of Herodotus, who informs us, that a colony went by sea from Lydia into Italy under Tyrrhenus; and Dionysius of Halicarnassus proves that many authors called them Pelagii. He then cites Hellanicus Leficus, an author somewhat more ancient than Herodotus, to prove, that they were first called Pelagii Tyrrheni; and when they passed into Italy, they settled in that part of it called Etruria. Their emigration took place about the year of the world 2011, or 1993 years before the Christian era, which is 350 years before the Pelagii left Greece. Bishop Cumberland adduces many proofs to show that the Tyrrhenians originally came out of Lydia into Italy. Several Roman authors also speak of this Lydian colony; and Horace compliments his patron Maecenas upon his Lydian descent:\n\nLydomum quicquid Etruscum\nIncoluit fines, nemo generosior est.\n\nThe Etruscan letters are Pelagian, and several of the Etruscan inscriptions are written in the Pelagian language. The Roman letters are Ionic. The Oscan Vol. I. Part II.\n\nLanguage was a dialect of the Etruscan; their characters are nearer the Ionic or Roman than the Etruscan. There is also very little difference between the Pelagian, Etruscan, and most ancient Greek letters, which are placed from right to left. The Arcadians were ancient Greeks, and used the Ionic letters; but at what time they began to write from left to right is not known, as their chronology is very uncertain. The Etruscan, Oscan, and Samnite alphabets, are derived from the Pelagian; they differ from each other more in name than in form; but a far greater number are derived from the Ionic Greek, namely, the Arcadian, the Latin or Roman, and the others already enumerated.—The Runic is immediately derived from the Gothic.\n\nAccording to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the first Greek colony which came into Italy consisted of Arcadians, under the conduct of Oenotrus, the son of Lycaon, and fifth in descent from Phoroneus, the first king of Argos, who reigned about 566 years before the taking of Troy, and 1750 years before the Christian era. These Oenotrians were called Aborigines; and after they had been engaged for many years in a war with the Siculi, entered into an alliance with a colony of the Pelagii, who came out of Thessaly into Italy, after having been driven from the former country. About 1476 B.C., another colony of the Pelagii, who had been driven out of Thessaly by the Curetes and Leleges, arrived in Italy, where they assisted the Aborigines to drive out the Siculi, possessing themselves of the greatest part of the country between the Tiber and the Liris, and building several cities. Sozomenus and Pliny tell us, that the Pelagii first carried letters into Italy; and the latter distinguishes between the Pelagian and the Arcadian; so the letters first carried into Italy were not the Ionic Greek, but those more ancient Pelagian characters which the Pelagii carried with them before Deucalion and Cadmus are said to have come into Boeotia and Thessaly. The story of Cadmus is much involved in fable; but it is agreed by most of the ancients, that the children of Agenor, viz., Cadmus, Europa, Phoenix, and Cilix, carried with them a colony, composed of Phoenicians and Syrians, into Asia Minor, Crete, Greece, and Libya, where they introduced letters, music, poetry, and other arts, sciences, and customs, of the Phoenicians.\n\nDionysius enumerates the following Greek colonies which came into Italy: 1. The Aborigines under Oenotrus, from Arcadia. 2. The Pelagian colony, which came from Eremonia or Thessaly. 3. Another Arcadian colony, which came with Evander from Palantium. 4. Those who came from Peloponnesus with Hercules; and 5. Those who came with Æneas from Troy. It is not easy to discover when the Ionic way of writing from left to right was introduced into Italy; but it is certain, that it did not universally prevail even in Greece till several ages after it was found out. The Athenians did not comply with it till the year of Rome 350; nor was it practised by the Samnites even in the 6th century of that city, or 230 years before Christ: for M. Gaebelein, Vol. VI. Pl. 2. gives us the Samnite alphabet of that century, wherein the letters are placed from right to left; although the Ionic way of writing prevailed in some parts of Italy in the third century of Rome. \"In time (says Pliny) the tacit consent of all nations...\"\nnations agreed to use the Ionic letters. The Romans consented to this mode about the time of Tarquinius Priscus, their fifth king. The letters brought by Demaratus the Corinthian, the father of Tarquin, Mr Wife thinks, must have been the new or Ionic alphabet, and not the same with that brought by Evander 500 years before. After the Romans had established the use of the Ionic letters, they seem not to have acknowledged the Pelasgian and Etruscan to have been Greek alphabets: the most learned of them knew none older than the Ionic, as appears from the Greek Farnese inscriptions of Herodes Atticus. This learned man, out of a regard to antiquity, caused the oldest orthography to be observed in the writing, and the letters to be delineated after the most antique forms that could be found; and they are plainly no other than the Ionic or right-handed characters.\n\nThe ancient Gaulish letters are derived from the Greek, and their writing approaches more nearly to the Gothic than that of the Romans: this appears by the monumental inscription of Gordian, messenger of the Gauls, who suffered martyrdom in the third century, with all his family. These ancient Gaulish characters were generally used by that people before the conquest of Gaul by Caesar; but after that time the Roman letters were gradually introduced. The ancient Spaniards used letters nearly Greek before their intercourse with the Romans. The ancient Gothic alphabet was very similar to the Greek, and is attributed to Ulpilas, bishop of the Goths, who lived in Moesia about 370 years after Christ. He translated the Bible into the Gothic tongue. This circumstance might have occasioned the tradition of his having invented these letters; but it is probable that these characters were in use long before this time. The Runic alphabet is derived from the ancient Gothic.\n\nThe Coptic letters are derived immediately from the Greek. Some have confounded them with the ancient Egyptian; but there is a very material difference between them. The Ethiopic alphabet is derived from the Coptic.\n\nThe alphabet proceeding from that of the Scythians established in Europe, is the same with what St Cyril calls the Servien. The Ruthenian, Illyrian, or Slavonic, and the Bulgarian, are all derived from the Greek. The Armenian letters differ very much from the Greek, from which they are derived, as well as from the Latin.\n\nWith regard to the alphabets derived from the Latin, the Lombardic relates to the manuscripts of Italy; the Visigothic to those of Spain; the Saxon to those of England; the Gallican and Franco-Gallic or Merovingian to the manuscripts of France; the German to those of that country; and the Caroline, Capetian, and Modern Gothic, to all the countries of Europe who read Latin. The first six of these alphabets are before the age of Charlemagne, the last three posterior to it. They are more distinguished by their names than the forms of their characters; and the former indicate all of them to have been of Roman extraction. Each nation, in adopting the letters of the Romans, added a taste and manner peculiar to itself; which obviously distinguished it from the writings of all other people; whence arose the differences between the writings of the Lombards, Spaniards, French, Saxons, Germans and Goths, and all the strange terms observable in the writings of the Francie Gauls or Merovingians; and those of the Carlovingians, their successors, may be traced from the same source. From these distinctions the name of national writing was derived.\n\nThe writing of Italy was uniform till the irruption of the Goths, who disfigured it by their barbarous taste. In 569, the Lombards, having possessed themselves of all Italy, excepting Rome and Ravenna, introduced that form of writing which goes under their name; and as the popes used the Lombardic manner in their bulls, the name of Roman was sometimes given to it in the 11th century; and though the dominion of the Lombards continued no longer than 206 years, the name of their writing continued in Italy from the 7th to the 13th century, and then ceased; when learning, having declined in that as well as in other countries, the manner of writing degenerated into the modern Gothic.\n\nThe Visigoths introduced their form of writing into Spain, after having overrun that country; but it was abolished in a provincial synod, held at Leon in 1091, when the Latin characters were established for all public instruments, though the Visigothic were used in private writings for three centuries afterwards.\n\nThe Gauls, on being subjected by the Romans, adopted their manner of writing; but by subsequent additions of their own, their characters were changed into what is called the Gallican or Roman Gallic mode. This was changed by the Franks into the Franco-Gallie or Merovingian mode of writing, being practised under the kings of the Merovingian race. It took place towards the close of the fifth century, and continued till the beginning of the ninth.\n\nThe German mode of writing was improved by Charlemagne; and this improvement occasioned another distinction in writing, by introducing the alphabet named Caroline, which declined in the 12th century, and was succeeded in the 13th by the modern Gothic. In France it had degenerated by the middle of the 10th century, but was restored in 897 by Hugh Capet, whence it obtained the name of Capetian. It was used in England, as well as Germany and France.\n\nThe modern Gothic, which spread itself all over Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, is improperly named, as not deriving its origin from the writing anciently used by the Goths. It is, however, the worst and most barbarous way of writing, and originated among the schoolmen in the decline of the arts; being indeed nothing else than Latin writing degenerated. It began in the 12th century, and was in general use, especially among monks and schoolmen, in all parts of Europe, till the restoration of arts in the 15th century, and continued longer in Germany and the northern nations. Our statute books are still printed in Gothic letters. The most barbarous writing of the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, was preferable to the modern Gothic. It is diversified in such a manner as can scarce admit of description; and the abbreviations used by the writers were so numerous, that it became very difficult to read it; which was one of the great causes of the ignorance of those times. Along with this, however,\nAlphabet, however, the Lombardic, Gothic, Roman, Caroline, and Capetian modes of writing, were occasionally used by individuals.\n\nThe idea that all the alphabets above mentioned are derived from the Roman, tends to prove the distinction of national writing, and is of great use in discovering the age of manuscripts: for though we may not be able exactly to determine the time when a manuscript was written, we may be able nearly to ascertain its age. For example, if a writing is Merovingian, it may be declared not to be posterior to the 6th, nor prior to the 5th century. If another be Lombardic, it may be affirmed to be posterior to the middle of the 6th, and prior to the 13th. Should it be Saxon, it cannot be of an earlier date than the 7th, nor later than about the middle of the 12th.\n\nHaving considered whence the alphabets now in use throughout the various nations of the world are derived, it remains to say something concerning them as the elements of words, or how far they are capable of expressing those sounds which, by proper combination and arrangement, constitute articulate language. The number of simple sounds in any language cannot be very numerous; and it is plainly these simple sounds alone that we have occasion to represent by alphabetical characters. Hence the person who first invented letters must have been capable of analyzing language in a manner which seems by no means easy to do, and concerning which even the learned among ourselves are not yet agreed. It is this difficulty which has produced the great diversity in the number of alphabetical characters used by different nations; and where we see a vast number of them used, we may account the writing not the better, but much the worse for it; and whoever the pretended inventor was, it is more reasonable to suppose that he disfigured an alphabet already invented, by unnecessary additions, than that he was the author of one himself.\n\nWhen we consider alphabetical characters as thus resulting from an analysis of language, it will by no means appear probable that it was derived from a gradual and progressive operation of the human mind through many ages. There is not the least affinity between representing any object by a picture and finding out the sounds which compose the word by which it is expressed: nor, though a nation had been in use to represent things either in this method, or by any kind of arbitrary marks, for thousands of years, could the one ever have led to the other. Arbitrary marks must always be the same with pictures in this respect, that they must always be fixed to particular objects, and thus be increased ad infinitum. Letters, on the other hand, are indifferent to all objects; and therefore, by their combinations, which are more numerous than as many arbitrary marks as we could remember, may express all the objects in nature. This might furnish an argument of some strength for the divine revelation of writing, were it not that other arts, seemingly as useful, and as difficult to be invented, had not been expressly ascribed to particular persons whom we cannot suppose to have been divinely inspired. Thus metallurgy, music, the keeping of cattle, and use of tents, are all ascribed to a single family; and though writing be not expressly mentioned as an invention in Scripture, there is no reason to have recourse to a revelation for it as long as the human faculties are known to have been sufficient for the invention of it. Nevertheless, if we take a review of the different arts which mankind have invented, we shall find, that few of them resulted from any gradual progress or evolution of the powers of the human mind, but rather by some sudden and almost unaccountable turn of thought in an individual. Thus, the art of printing, little inferior in its utility to that of writing, lay hid for ages, and was at last invented we scarcely know how; so that if one inclined to suppose this a divine revelation, he could be at little loss for arguments to support his hypothesis. This was what all the inventions and evolutions of human powers since the creation had never been able to accomplish; yet nobody believes that it required supernatural abilities to be the author of this art, because we see plainly that it might have occurred to the human mind from various sources, and are surprised that it did not occur long before. In like manner, the method of accounting for the celestial motions by the united forces of projection and gravitation, was no result of the progress that mankind had made in science, but luckily occurred to Mr Horrox, without any thing that we know to direct him, or perhaps from causes almost unknown to himself. Thus, also, the steam engine, aerostation, &c., were suddenly invented only by a slight review of principles well known before, and which had been a thousand times overlooked by those who might have invented both. Alphabetical writing, therefore, might have been no deduction from hieroglyphic or picture writing, from which it is essentially different; and it seems to be some confirmation of this, that all nations who ever pretended to the invention of letters, have ascribed it to the labours of one particular person, without taking notice of the progress made towards it in preceding ages.\n\nThe learned author of Hermes informs us, that to Of the about 20 plain elementary sounds we owe that variety of articulate voices which have been sufficient to explain the sentiments of such an innumerable multitude as all the past and present generations of men. Mr Sheridan says, that the number of simple sounds in our tongue is 28; while Dr Kenrick says, that we have only 11 distinct species of articulate sounds, which even by contraction, prolongation, and composition, are increased only to the number of 16; every syllable or articulate sound in our language being one of the number. Bishop Wilkins and Dr William Holder speak of 33 distinct sounds.\n\nAfter the analysis or decomposition of language into the elementary sounds, the next towards the notation of it by alphabetical characters, would be the delineation of a separate mark or letter to represent each sound; which marks, though few in number, would admit of such a variety of arrangements and combinations, as might be capable of producing that infinity of articulate sounds which compose language. The ingenious Wachter, in his Nature et Scripture Concordia, p. 64, endeavours to show, that ten marks or characters are sufficient for this purpose. His scheme is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{A Z 2}\n\\]\n\nGenus.\nIf this is the case, then the most simple alphabet, which consists only of 13 letters, must have been abundantly sufficient to answer all the purposes of mankind, and much of our twenty-four letter alphabet may appear superfluous. That able mathematician Tacquet has calculated the various combinations of the 24 letters, even without any repetition, to amount to no fewer than $629,448,401,733,239,439,360,000$; while Clavius makes them only $5,852,616,738,497,664,000$. Either of these numbers, however, is infinite to the human conceptions, and much more than sufficient to express all the sounds that ever were articulated by man.\n\nAs there are more sounds in some languages than in others, it follows of course, that the number of elementary characters or letters must vary in the alphabets of different languages. The Hebrew, Samaritan, and Syriac alphabets, have 22 letters; the Arabic 28; the Persian, and Egyptian or Coptic, 32; the present Russian 41; the Shanshiri 50; while the Cashmirian and Malabar are still more numerous. The following is the scheme of the English alphabet, as given by Mr Sheridan in his Rhetorical Grammar, p. 9.\n\nNumber of simple sounds in our tongue 28.\n\n| Genus | Figura | Poteftas |\n|-------|--------|----------|\n| Vocal | O      | a. e. i. o. u. |\n| Guttural | O     | k. c. ch. q. g. h. |\n| Lingual | L     | l. |\n| Lingual | Z     | d. t. |\n| Lingual | R     | r. |\n| Dental | N     | f. |\n| Labial | 3     | b. p. |\n| Labial | N     | m. |\n| Labial | R     | s. ph. v. w. |\n| Nasal | A     | n. |\n\nNumber of letters in different alphabets.\n\n| Number of letters |\n|------------------|\n| Hebrew           |\n| Samaritan        |\n| Syriac           |\n| Arabic           |\n| Persian          |\n| Egyptian         |\n| Coptic           |\n| Russian          |\n| Shanshiri        |\n| Cashmirian       |\n| Malabar          |\n\nConsonants divided into Mutes and Semivowels.\n\n6 Mutes, eb ed eg ek ep et.\n3 Pure Mutes, ck ep et.\n3 Impure, eb ed eg.\n\n13 Semivowels or liquids, ef el em en er es ev ez eth ing.\n\n9 Vocal, el em en er ez eth ing.\n4 Aspirated, ef els eth efh.\n\nDivided again into\n\n4 Labial, eb ep ev ef.\n8 Dental, ed et eth eth ez els ezh efh.\n4 Palatine, eg ek el er.\n3 Nasal, em en ing.\n\nMr Sheridan observes, that our alphabet is ill calculated for the notation of the English tongue, as there are many sounds for which we have no letters or marks; and there ought to be nine more characters or letters to make a complete alphabet, in which every simple sound ought to have a mark peculiar to itself. The reason of the deficiency is, that the Roman alphabet was formerly adopted for the notation of the English language, though by no means suited to the purpose.\n\nIt now remains only to take some notice of the forms of the different letters; some knowledge of which is absolutely necessary for ascertaining the age and authenticity of inscriptions, manuscripts, charters, and ancient records. Many authors are of opinion, that letters derive their forms from the positions of the organs of speech in their pronunciation. Van Helmont has taken great pains to prove, that the Chaldaic characters are the genuine alphabet of nature; because, according to him, no letter can be rightly founded without disposing the organs of speech into a uniform position with the figure of each letter; and in support of this system, he has anatomized the organs of articulation.\n\nMr Nelme has endeavoured to show, that all elementary characters or letters derive their forms from the line and the circle. His alphabet consists of 13 radical letters, four diminished and four augmented.—The radicals are L, O, S, A, B, C, D, N, U, I, E, M, R.—H, according to him, is derived from A; P from B; T from D; and F from U: they are called diminished letters. The augmented ones are, Z from S; G from C; W from U; and Y from I. He proves that his characters are very similar to those of the ancient Etruscans; but all characters are composed either of lines and circles of the former, or of parts of the latter.—Mr Gebelin deduces them from hieroglyphic representations; and has given several delineations of human figures, trees, &c., in confirmation of his hypothesis.\n\nOne of the most simple alphabets has been formed by making two perpendicular and two horizontal lines:\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n\nThus, \\( \\begin{array}{ccc}\na & b & c \\\\\nd & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i \\\\\n\\end{array} \\)\n\nFrom which may be deduced nine different characters or letters: Thus,\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\na & b & c & d & e & f \\\\\ng & h & i & j & k & l \\\\\n\\end{array} \\]\n| Phoenicum | Hbr. ex Mediat. | Bastulam | Etruscam | Graecum | Graecum | Latinum | Runicum | Gothicum | Copticum | Teutonicum

When that country was distracted by intestine commotions, in the latter end of the 16th century, and the royal house particularly was so feverishly persecuted by impostors, this gentleman and his two brothers were sent over to England, and recommended to the care of Mr Joseph Bidell a Russia merchant. Mr Bidell, when they were of age fit for the university, sent them to Oxford, where the smallpox unhappily prevailing, two of them died of it. We know not whether this surviving brother took any degrees or not, but it is very probable he did, since he entered into holy orders; and in the year 1618, was presented to the rectory of Wooley in Huntingdonshire, a living of no very considerable value, being rated under 10l. in the king's books. Here he did his duty with great cheerfulness and alacrity; and although he was twice invited back to his native country by some who would have ventured their utmost to have fet him on the throne of his ancestors, he chose rather to remain with his flock, and to serve God in the humble station of a parish priest. Yet in 1643, he underwent the severest trials from the rage of the fanatics; who, not satisfied with depriving him of his living, insulted him in the most barbarous manner; for, having procured a file of musqueteers to pull him out of his pulpit, as he was preaching on a Sunday, they turned his wife and small children into the street, into which also they threw his goods. The poor man in this distress raised a tent under some trees in the churchyard, over against his house, where he and his family lived for a week. One day having gotten a few eggs, he picked up some rotten wood and dry sticks, and with these made a fire in the church porch, in order to boil them; but some of his adversaries, to show how far they could carry their rage against the church (for this poor man was so harmless they could have none against him), came and kicked about his fire, threw down his billet, and broke his eggs.\n\nAfter this, having still a little money, he made a small Alpheus purchase in that neighbourhood, built a house, and lived there some years. He was encouraged to this by the Presbyterian minister, who came in his room, who honestly paid him the fifth part of the annual income of the living, which was the allowance made by parliament to ejected ministers, treated him with great humanity, and did him all the favours in his power. It is a great misfortune that this gentleman's name is not preserved, his conduct in this respect being the more laudable, because it was not a little singular. Afterwards, probably on the death or removal of this gentleman, Mr Alpher left Huntingdonshire, and came and resided at Hammersmith till the Restoration put him in possession of his living again. He returned on this occasion to Huntingdonshire, where he did not stay long; for being upwards of 80, and withal very infirm, he could not perform the duties of his function. Having, therefore, settled a curate, he retired to his eldest son's house at Hammersmith, where soon after he died, much honoured and respected, and affording a remarkable instance of the vicissitudes of the world.\n\nALPHEUS, (Strabo); ALPEUS, (Ptolemy); a noted and large river of the Peloponnesus; which, rising in, and after several windings running through Arcadia, and by Olympia in Elis, with a south-west course, falls into the Sinus Cheloniotes, about ten miles to the south of Olympia. It has a common spring with the Eurotas, at the foot of Mount Parthenius, near the village Alea, (Strabo.) The Alpheus and Eurotas mix and run together for 20 stadia; after which, they enter a subterraneous passage at Mantinea; then again emerge, the Eurotas in Laconia, and the Alpheus in the territory of Megalopolis, (Pausanias.) The poets' fable (strange things of this river, particularly, that out of love to the nymph Arethusa, it runs under the sea to Sicily, and bursts out at the fountain of that name in Syracuse, (Virgil.) Its waters were reckoned good in the leprosy, which is called Αλφειος by the Greeks; and hence the name Alpheus. On the banks of this river the Olympic games were celebrated, to which Pindar alludes.\n\n\"Alpheus, thy immortal flood,\nOn his lord's triumphant brows\nThe Olympic wreath bestow'd.\"\n\nWEST'S PINDAR.\n\nPausanias adds, that the Eleans had a law, which condemned any woman to death that should either appear at the Olympic games, or even cross this river during that solemnity: and the Eleans add, that the only woman who transgressed it, had disguised herself in the habit of a master or keeper of the games, and conducted her son thither; but when she saw him come off victorious, her joy made her forget her disguise, so that her sex was discovered. She was pardoned; but from that time a law was made that the keepers should appear there naked.\n\nALPHONSIN, in Surgery, an instrument for extracting bullets out of gunshot wounds. This instrument derives its name from the inventor Alphonso Ferrier, a physician of Naples. It consists of three branches, which are closed by a ring. When closed and introduced into the wound, the operator draws back the ring towards the handle, upon which the branches...\nAlphonso branches opening take hold of the ball; and then the ring is pulled from the haft, by which means the branches grasp the ball so firmly as to extract it from the wound.\n\nALPHONSO I. king of Portugal, son of Henry of Burgundy, count of Portugal, grandson of Don Alonso king of Leon and Castile, who, as the dowry of his wife Theresa, received part of the kingdom of Portugal. One Egas Munitz had the charge of his education from his father, the duties of which he executed with fidelity and success. In the year 1112 his father died, leaving him a boy only three years of age, when the reins of government and the care of the infant son fell to his mother Theresa. At the age of 18 he assumed the sovereign authority by the advice of the nobles of Portugal, who were highly offended at the growing partiality of his mother for Don Ferdinand Perez, count of Trastamara; for it was suspected that she intended to marry him. But Theresa was little disposed to resign the reins of government. Her party raised an army which took the field to oppose the nobility who supported Alphonso; but her adherents were defeated, herself taken prisoner, and kept in confinement during the remainder of her life. Not long after his accession to the throne, his abilities both to govern and to conquer received a severe trial, in several arduous enterprises, as well against the king of Leon and Castile as against the Moorish princes, who then possessed great part of Spain and Portugal. The Moorish emperor in Barbary having sent a strong reinforcement to the princes, they were enabled to take the field with an army far superior to that of Alphonso's; yet he valiantly met them in the plains of Ourique, and totally defeated their forces. Thus Providence conferred such a signal favour on the Christian arms as procured a residence for Christianity in those parts. The ambitious king of Leon and Castile assumed the title of emperor of the Spaniards, and entered Portugal to waste and destroy; but after the emperor had received a temporary check, the matter was accommodated, and he withdrew his army. In consequence of the victory obtained on the plains of Ourique, Alphonso was instantly proclaimed king; but the form and constitution of the monarchy was not settled until the nobility, prelates, and commons had assembled at Lamego for that purpose in the year 1145. The conquest of Santarem preceded this event, and was sanctioned by the unanimous concurrence of the states. The honour of crowning the king was conferred upon the archbishop of Braga; and it was legally provided, that the royal succession should descend with an uninterrupted succession to the heirs male of Alphonso. The prelates and nobility, with the concurrence of the people, instituted a code of laws consisting of 18 statutes, for the government of the kingdom. It being proposed whether it was their pleasure that the king should go to Leon and do homage to that prince or to any other, every man drawing his sword, exclaimed, \"We are free, and our king is free, and we owe our liberty to our courage; and if he shall at any time submit to such an act, he deserves death, and shall not either reign over us or among us.\" The year after his coronation he was married to Matilda, daughter of Amadeus, count of Maurienne and Savoy; and he recovered Lisbon from the hands of the Moors, in the year 1147. A multitude of adventurers being assembled at the mouth of the Tagus in their progress to the Holy Land, greatly assisted him in this conquest. After having added six other provinces to his dominions, he wisely began with industrious activity to regulate the affairs of his kingdom. In all his great and benevolent designs he was vigorously seconded by Matilda, a princess equally celebrated for her great beauty, mental vigour, and singular piety. With the prudence of the statesman, and the benevolence of the man, he laboured as much for the population of his acquired territories as for their increase. The conjugal felicity of this prince and princess was greatly enhanced by a numerous offspring, which enabled him, by great alliances, to strengthen his interests. His second daughter was married to Don Ferdinand, king of Leon, who, notwithstanding this alliance, generously made war on his father-in-law, and took him prisoner in the field of battle; but released him, on the humiliating condition of coming in person to do homage for his dominions at Leon. In the latter part of his reign, his son Don Sancho, who inherited all his father's military talents, took the lead on several occasions; and in the year 1180, Joseph, king of Morocco, and emperor of the Almohades, advanced with an army as far as Santarem, and there gained a glorious victory over him. Such was the contumacy of the infidels, in consequence of this defeat, that they left the Portuguese at liberty to improve the interior part of the country, and to fortify their frontiers during the whole of the next year. Worn out with care and intense application, Alphonso needed repose, and had retired to Coimbra, where, after a reign of 37 years, and in the 76th year of his age, he died. In the church of the holy cross at Coimbra his remains were deposited with great funeral solemnity. He was no less than seven feet high; and his gigantic size and his martial ardour have given occasion to many absurd and incredible stories concerning his military achievements, so that, in the annals of chivalry, as well as in the records of martial exertions, he attains a very high rank. Two orders of knighthood, that of the Wings, and that of the Avis, were instituted by him; and they still continue to flourish in that kingdom. At the age of 31, when all the faculties of the human mind are in full vigour, Don Sancho, his son, succeeded him. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nALPHONSO II. distinguished by the surname of the Fat, was the third king of Portugal, and succeeded his father at the age of 27 years, in 1212. His accomplished education and his military and political talents were tarnished by his great neglect and hatred of his brothers and sisters, which involved him in many troubles. He, however, commenced his reign with two very popular actions. The one was, sending a body of infantry to the assistance of the king of Castile, who fought with uncommon bravery in the renowned battle of Navas de Tolosa. The other was, his donation of the Castle of Avis to the knights of that order, when the grand-master removed from Evora, and took up his habitation in that castle. During the life of his father, he discovered his aversion to the rest of the family, which induced him to secure the right of his children from the effects of his resentment.\nAlphonso, as much as in his power, by conferring upon them large sums of money and jewels, and some of the best parts of the kingdom. After the death of his father, however, Alphonso strenuously laboured to convince them that it was not in the power of his father to separate or give away any part of his dominions; but all his urgent eloquence proving unsuccessful, he had recourse to arms. The two princesses, his sisters, who had received by the grant of their father very extensive and valuable property, upon being attacked by their brother, implored the interference of the pope, and also applied to the king of Leon, to grant his protection, so that they made a very vigorous defence. The pope granted the request of the young princesses, and threatened to excommunicate Alphonso; and from Galicia, Don Ferdinand entered the dominions of Portugal to ravage and destroy; but the king prepared to defend himself against the arms of the king of Leon, and by specious pretences to evade the excommunication of the pope.\n\nAuthors are not agreed with respect to the success of this war, but it is generally supposed that, by the interference of these two powerful persons, the domestic affairs of that house were restored to a certain degree of tranquillity; however, the departure of the infant Don Ferdinand to the court of Castile, and of Don Pedro to another place, strongly indicate that the reconciliation was far from being perfect. The conduct of the king, however, produced much diversity of opinion among the common people of Portugal. Some were induced, by the arguments of the king, to conclude that it was not in the power of Don Sancho, the late king, to dismember his kingdom; and others very properly suspected the kindness of a prince to his people who displayed such uncommon and such unfathomable hatred to his own relations; at the same time, those nobles whom the father had solemnly sworn to carry his will into execution, regarded the sacred nature of their oaths to such a degree as induced them to operate against the reigning prince.\n\nThe displeasure of the pope, however, was not to be endured. The mind of Alphonso seemed indeed to be of that quality which little regarded the displeasure or thunders of his holiness; but the effects of his threatenings were very different upon the public mind, consequently the king was constrained to seek the favour of the pope, to retain the obedience of his subjects. The king therefore sent deputies to Rome, who argued, that the crown his father wore was the purchase of the blood and valour of the Portuguese nation, and therefore not in his power to alienate; that it was a dangerous precedent, and obviously tended to subvert the sovereignty of a state; that the diminution of the kingdom would tend to promote the cause of the infidels; and, in fine, that his disputes with his sisters had no connexion with ecclesiastical matters. The pope, however, was as well qualified to discern the nature of these specious arguments as the prince was qualified to urge them, consequently he remained unmoved; and Alphonso, in order to have the sentence of excommunication removed which had been pronounced upon him, was reluctantly induced to be reconciled to his sisters. His holiness informed of the reconciliation, with great ceremony revoked his curse and excommunication from the king and his subjects.\n\nBut the reign of this prince was destined to troubles; for no sooner was this domestic broil terminated, than the Moors rushed into the plain country in such prodigious numbers, that the king found it very difficult to repel them, or to drive them back to their own country. A favourable occurrence, however, enabled him to complete his object, by the taking of a fortress seated on a rock which was deemed impregnable, in the following manner. The Germans and Flemings had equipped an immense fleet destined for the Holy Land, consisting of 300 sail, with a numerous army on board. In consequence of tempestuous weather, their fleet was so disabled that they were forced to put into the harbour of Lisbon to refit, just at the time when Alphonso was preparing an army to attack the Moors. The king instantly sent some of the most respectable men of his court to solicit their aid against the Moors, alleging that it was perfectly consistent with their vows to fight against the Moors in Portugal, as well as in the Holy Land. William earl of Holland, and many other generals, were convinced by this argument, and cheerfully engaged to join him against the infidels; but about a third part of the fleet refused to join, and proceeded on their voyage. It happened, however, that they were driven by a violent storm into Italy, where they wintered. The greater part of the nobility and gentry landed under the conduct of William earl of Holland; and it was resolved that they should proceed by sea, and block up Alcacer-do-Sal, the fortress already mentioned, while the army of Alphonso, reinforced by a considerable number, should march by land; and thus attack the place both by land and sea at once. The Moors, convinced of the importance of this place, brought an army into the field consisting of 50,000 men; but the Christians raised the siege, gave them battle, and routed them with great slaughter; and some of the chiefs of the Moors fell in the field. The fortresses surrendered on the 21st of October 1217, and was conferred upon the order of St James; but notwithstanding of very urgent entreaties, the pope would not permit the army to winter in Portugal. He was furious of having these troops and their generals removed to a greater distance. The writers of that nation affirm that the soldiers experienced supernatural aid in this battle, and that the banner of the cross was actually displayed by angels.\n\nBut civil animosity succeeded to infidel war. The archbishop of Braga was highly offended that the clergy were forced to pay money and furnish troops to carry on the war against the infidels; and the people severely complained of the strictness of the laws. To chastise the rebellious clergy, the king seized upon the revenues of the bishop, and forced him to fly from his dominions. Enraged at this impious conduct, the pope excommunicated the king, and laid his kingdom under an interdict. The natural consequence was, that all things were thrown into confusion and consternation, and perplexity universally prevailed; so that Alphonso was obliged to consult measures to quell the rising discontent. It happened, however, that in the midst of these negotiations he was removed by death, and not only died under the papal malediction, but left his kingdom under the same curse. He was interred without royal honours in the conventual church.\nAlphonso church of Alcobaça. His person was above the common size; he was brave and strong, but not devoid of many qualities worthy of blame. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso III. Don, king of Portugal, succeeded his brother Don Sancho II, in the year 1248. In the course of a war with the Moors, which he engaged in at the beginning of his reign, he considerably extended the Portuguese dominions. He took possession of the city of Fara, the capital of the Moorish kingdom, in the province of Algarve. Loula, another Moorish town, which was carried by storm, also fell into his hands. His power was thus extended abroad by the success of his arms, and the administration of his affairs at home became prosperous and popular by his wisdom and prudence. But the tranquillity and prosperity of the kingdom were somewhat disturbed by an interdict which it was put under by Pope Alexander IV, whose displeasure he had incurred by marrying Donna Beatrix, the natural daughter of Don Alfonso the Wise, king of Castile, while his first wife was living. In 1262, when his first queen died, the interdict was removed by Pope Urban, a dispensation was granted, and the children of Donna Beatrix were legitimated. Hitherto frequent disputes had occurred between the kings of Portugal and Castile relating to the boundaries of the two kingdoms. To terminate all differences on this subject, and to prevent them in future, commissioners were appointed to define and settle the limits of their respective dominions; and these were agreed to and acknowledged by a solemn deed.\n\nEncouraged by the prosperity of his kingdom, and by the success which had attended his enterprises, Alphonso made an attempt to extend the influence of the crown, by obliging the clergy to contribute to the welfare of the state. But this measure, as might have been expected, was not quietly submitted to. It occasioned the revival of old disputes, the pope interfered, and in 1268 the kingdom was again laid under an interdict. He succeeded, by the wisdom of his negotiations, in obtaining from Castile an exemption of all claims upon the crown of Portugal, and in procuring an acknowledgment that its monarchs were entirely relieved from the performance of every kind of homage. He died in the year 1279, in the 60th year of his age, and in the 31st of his reign. Before his death, he was reconciled to the pope and clergy, having made a full and ample submission. This prince was tall in stature, of a prepossessing aspect, and of engaging manners. Alike removed from a disposition to extravagant expense or fond avarice, in times of peace and prosperity, he could indulge in magnificence; but when his affairs required it, he failed not to regulate them by frugality and economy. To the poor he was a sincere friend. In a time of scarcity, he pawned his crown to provide them with bread. His steady and vigorous administration secured to him the respect of the nobles and the obedience of the clergy. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso IV. king of Portugal, surnamed the Brave, was the son of King Denis. Inflamed, it is said, by the queen dowager of Castile, and moved with jealousy against his natural brother Alphonso Sanchez, he revolted against his father, and commenced a civil war. In this unnatural and baleful war, he was justly unsuccessful; but although he was reduced to subjection, yet his haughty and ungovernable temper broke out in many occurrences, until he succeeded his father in 1324. Hunting was his favourite amusement at the time when he ascended the throne; and one day entertaining his counsellors with a narrative of his sporting adventures during a month, one of them ventured to remonstrate against his conduct, and even proceeded to threaten, that if the grievances of his subjects were not speedily redressed, they would be forced to look out for a better king. Alphonso was greatly enraged; but suddenly recollecting himself, he said, \"I perceive the truth of your remark; he cannot long have subjects who will not be a king. Remember that from this day, you have nothing to do with Alphonso the sportman, but with Alphonso the king of Portugal.\" To this resolution he strictly adhered, and exercising the power of a despot, he overawed his subjects, without conciliating their favour or procuring their esteem. He displayed a conduct very singular in a young man, regarding those who had so vigorously opposed him when at war with his father, as friends to the crown, although enemies to the young ambitious prince. He commenced his reign with devising plans for the security of his family in the government, and the good of the kingdom; he likewise manifested a strong benevolence of heart, in his affection for his consort queen Beatrix, and his dutiful conduct towards his mother. Notwithstanding all these amiable qualities, he persecuted his brother Alonzo Sanchez, and wished to inflict the punishment due to him as a profligate traitor; which drove the desperate Alonso to open rebellion. But, however, the natural good qualities of the heart of the king rose superior; so that his persecuted brother was again received into favour. Not long after he engaged in war with Alonso XI, king of Castile, and which, after several severe struggles with varying success on both sides, terminated in an alliance, and in effectual assistance against the Moors. The artful and cruel part which he acted towards Donna Agnes de Castro, the mistress and concealed wife of his son, reflected the greatest disgrace upon his character. It is proper, however, to remark, that he was implicated to the murder of this princess by his courtiers. It was not therefore to be wondered at if his son was induced by this act to rise up in open rebellion against him, but the arms of his father were too formidable; and after his submission, his father treated him with particular marks of attention. Instructed by the growing infirmities of years, he saw the termination of his reign and his life approaching. He began to compensate for his past errors and faults, by establishing acts of piety and benevolence, by redressing grievances, by restraining immorality through the establishment of pious laws, by dictating salutary maxims for the government of the state, by removing those from the seats of power, who were the most likely to become the objects of resentment after his death; he thus laboured to efface from the remembrance of his son the insult which he had received. While concerting these conciliating measures, he died in May 1357, in the 32d year of his reign, and the 67th of his age, \"with the character of an undutiful son, an unnatural brother, and a cruel father.\" But in many respects he deserves the character \"of a great man and a great king, brave and fortunate in war, but artful and indirect in his political measures, attached to his subjects,\"\nAlphonso subjects, strict in the administration of justice, attentive to the public welfare, and affilious in encouraging industry, and enriching his people.\" But after all, it must be acknowledged, that although he was feared and even esteemed, he was not much honoured nor beloved, but was rather reverenced for a proper use of power, than relied upon as a public parent. His character is perhaps expressed in his device, which was an eagle on the wing, with the following motto, *aliae peto*, \"I aim at higher things.\"\n\n**Alphonso V. Don**, king of Portugal, was born in 1432, and on account of his heroic deeds, obtained the surname of the African. At the age of six years, he succeeded his father King Edward. The administration of the affairs of the kingdom during his minority, was entrusted to his uncle Don Pedro, who, although his public conduct met with general approbation, was persecuted as a traitor at the expiration of his regency, and with several persons who were attached to his interest, and involved in his misfortunes, was put to death. The young king had married the daughter of the regent; but even his influence, which was overpowered by the regent's enemies, could not save him from persecution. Afterwards indeed he did justice to his memory, and discovered an unusual mark of respect and attachment to his queen, by abstaining from all connexion with the sex after her death, which happened in 1455, and it has been supposed, was occasioned by poison, administered by the enemies of her father.\n\nAlphonso aspired to the acquisition of military glory. In the year 1458, he made great preparations to attack the Moors in Barbary. He assembled an army of 20,000 men, and equipped a fleet of 200 sail. He first directed his arms against Alcazar, which soon fell into his hands; and to maintain the footing which he had gained, he furnished this place with a strong garrison. For 12 years he prosecuted the war in Barbary with various success, in that time reduced Arzila and Tangier, and in 1740, returned to Portugal loaded with honours. It was then he obtained the surname of African, and to the titles which he derived from his ancestors, added that of lord of the coasts on both seas. And with a view to perpetuate the memory of these exploits and conquests, he caused a representation of them to be wrought in tapestry, a monument purely constructed of very frail materials, but not less durable than many which have been erected by ambition and vanity. During the war in Africa, a military order denominated the knights of the sword was founded.\n\nAlphonso was less successful in supporting the claim of his niece Donna Joanna to the crown of Castile against Ferdinand and Isabella. Finding his own resources unequal to the contest in which he was engaged, he took a journey to France to solicit the aid of Lewis XI. But his solicitations proved fruitless; and the mortification which he experienced from this faithless monarch, filled him with melancholy, and induced him to resign his crown for the purpose of making a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The administration of affairs during his absence, was committed to the hands of his son Don Juan, who governed the kingdom with great ability. When the king returned, he was joyfully received by the prince, and reinstated in his authority. But the mind of Alphonso had lost its wonted vigour, and was unfit to resume the arduous duties of government. Oppressed still with a deep melancholy, he determined at length to withdraw from the cares of a kingdom, and to end his days in the repose and quiet of a monastery. But on his journey to the place of his retirement, he was seized with the plague at Cintra, where he died in the year 1481, in the 43rd year of his reign, and the 49th of his age. The moderation, the wisdom and prudence which this prince exhibited in his public conduct, were not more powerful in conciliating the love and veneration of his subjects, and of all good men, than were the amiable virtues of his private character. He was distinguished for his affability and condescension, his benevolence and bounty, and especially for his unbounded charity. In the exercise of this latter virtue, he was honoured with the title of redeemer of the captives, in consequence of his having procured the freedom of many prisoners, whose ransom he cheerfully paid. Nor was he less eminent for his chastity and temperance, his attachment to letters, and his love and encouragement of learning. The first library in the palace of the kings of Portugal was founded in his time. He established and vindicated against the pretensions and hostile attempts of the Spaniards, a very profitable trade on the coast of Guinea, which country was discovered during his reign, under the auspices of his uncle Don Henry, a celebrated character of that age. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\n**Alphonso VI. Don Enriques**, king of Portugal, ascended the throne when only a child of thirteen years of age. It is not easy to conceive a kingdom in a more perilous situation than this at the death of Don John. The young king was remarkable for weakness of body, and imbecility of mind; the regency in the hands of a woman, and that woman a Castilian; the nation involved in war, and this reflecting the title to the crown; many of the nobility engaged in feuds and contentions with each other, and some of them secretly disaffected to the reigning family; so that the queen scarcely knew to whom she could trust, or by whom she was to be obeyed. A very indecent joy was manifested by the people on the king's death, as if his death was the dissolution of government: but the great abilities of the queen, and the vigorous measures which she adopted, soon changed the face of affairs. For her own safety, and the prosperity of the kingdom, she appointed Don Francisco de Faro, count of Odemira, of the house of Braganza, governor to the king, and one of her principal ministers of state; and she made choice of Don Antonio de Meneses, count de Caltenheda, to be his coadjutor. The former was a person in high repute among the nobility, in great favour with the people, entirely devoted to the interests of the queen, possessed of a large estate, and far advanced in years; the latter was also an aged man of great talents, and equally capable to preside in the cabinet, and to command in the field. As might naturally be expected, these men sometimes differed in opinion; but this difference never hurt the cause of the queen. Seconded, protected, and counselled by such able men, the nation began to feel the effects of the queen's firmness and superior talents.\n\nThe first important exertion of the queen was, to\nAlphonso send express orders to the count de San Lorenzo, who commanded on the frontiers, to act offensively; but the measure, though prudent in itself, was not attended with the desired success. About this time, however, the duke de St Germain, an Italian officer in the service of Spain, entered Portugal, besieged and took Olivenza and the castle of Moran. In consequence of this, the general was dismissed, and his place was filled by Juan Mendez Valencelles, a man in great favour with the troops, and universally popular. He engaged to act also upon the offensive, but being unsuccessful, he was only saved from punishment by his simple and candid defence; in which he says, \"that he had undertaken the siege in obedience to the order of the queen, and for the honour of the nation; and that he had raised it without orders, for the preservation of the army: that he knew the hazard he ran when he did it, but that it gave him pleasure to think, that at the hazard, or even the loss, of his reputation and life, the troops of Portugal had been saved.\" He was declared innocent and worthy of the queen's favour, by the council of war who presided. Don Sancho Manuel, who commanded in Elvas, and defended it with equal bravery and conduct, shewed himself to be an officer of considerable degree of judgment, by his hazarding nothing more when he had performed his service, upon which the very being of the state depended; but it was the count de Caftanheira who raised that siege, and forced the army of Spain in their lines. After some other political measures, some of them more, and some of them less important; the queen regent finished in a manner, her administration, with the marriage of her only daughter, the princess Catharine, once intended for Lewis XIV. with Charles II. king of Great Britain, one of the most fortunate events that ever happened for Portugal; since it immediately procured them the protection of the English fleets, reinforcements of some thousands of horse and foot; besides adding much reputation to their affairs throughout Europe; which was the reason that the Spanish court opposed it with so much heat, or rather, passion. By the vigorous exertions and fortunate victories of Montefelos, the war was soon terminated to the honour of Portugal. The fifth and last victory in the course of 28 years, was obtained by the Marquis de Marialva, which was chiefly owing to unforeseen accidents, and the determined courage of foreign troops, and to the great abilities of Schomberg. This victory determined the fate of the kingdom, though not of the sovereign; and it was easy to be seen by the more intelligent sort of people in Portugal, that the king would sooner or later be depoed.\n\nAlphonso being struck with the palsy while a child, rendered it necessary to treat him with indulgence, on account of his weak state of health; consequently, as he rose to maturity, his want of parts, and the defects in his education, were very perceptible. It is alleged that a greater affection was thrown by the queen his mother, to the infant Don Pedro, and that she endeavoured at the time of their father's decease, to infuse into the nobles an idea of preferring him; but they universally declined to make a breach in the succession, declaring it was difficult to make an estimate of the powers of a king who was then only a child. The queen yielded, and endeavoured by every proper means to make him worthy of a crown, which, by birth, he was entitled to wear. The count de Odenira, who was charged with his education, found it a very difficult task to manage the young prince, who, forgetful of his birth and destination, was prone only to those amusements which the youth of his age were accustomed to. His guardian and preceptor struggled with this disposition, and even ventured to take some pretty severe measures; but to his great mortification, it proved entirely abortive. Education can only improve, but can never confer mental abilities. Yet he was quick enough to perceive he was a king, which proved very fatal to him. Those who approached his person complied with his follies, and, even commended the most absurd actions; and those who were independent of the court inveighed against him in the strongest terms, and, because guilty of some childish actions, they ascribed to him all the cruel and foolish accidents which happened in Lisbon. Unfortunately, however, for his adversaries, many of these actions, such as fighting of dogs, scouring the streets, encountering three men alone, running at a bull, and such like, indicate no want of strength or courage. A variety of facts that might be mentioned, are sufficient evidence that his natural dispositions were weak, wild, refractory, and unteachable; and that although he was born to reign, yet he was destitute of the qualities absolutely necessary in a prince. The direful consequences of this having been for some time experienced by the nation, the nobles at last were driven to the revolution of deposing the king, and exalting Don Pedro to the regency. In the morning of the next day after the determination, the marquis de Calcaes, at the head of the council, went to the palace to propose the resignation to the king. The king was in bed and fast asleep; the marquis ordered him to be awakened, and knocked violently at the door for that purpose; and when he had obtained admission, he is said to have upbraided him in very coarse terms for his laziness and inattention to public affairs at so critical a conjuncture; adding, that since he must be sensible of his want of abilities to govern a kingdom, the wisest method he could adopt was, to resign it in favour of his brother. The king absolutely refused to consent, but not long after, Don Pedro coming to the palace, ordered him to be confined in his apartment, where one of his favourites persuaded him, in the hope of being set at liberty, to make a short renunciation of the crown in favour of his brother Don Pedro, and his lawful issue, referring the house of Braganza and its dependencies, together with 100,000 crowns out of the revenue of the crown. Nor was this deemed sufficient: for a paper was presented to him, making him avow, that for want of consummation, his marriage was null. This he at first declined; but, by the advice of some divines, he was prevailed on to subscribe the deed. When evening drew on, the unhappy king then perceived he was a prisoner; upon which he sent to request his brother to let him have John, who managed his dog-kennel, to keep him company. When Don Pedro heard it, losing his usual calmness, he burst into a violent fit of passion, and instantly gave orders, that those who were the most agreeable to him, should remain in his apartment. Such was the situation of affairs until the meeting of the States. But\nin the mean time, the unfortunate Don Alonzo died, after he had been a prisoner near fifteen years, suddenly in the castle of Cintra, on the 12th of September, when he had borne the title of king almost twenty-seven, and had lived about forty years. It is reported, that he said in his last agonies, \"I am now going; but it will not be long before the queen shall follow me, to give an account, at the most awful tribunal, of the wrongs she has done me.\" (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAlphonso III. the Great, king of Asturias, was born in 847, and succeeded his father Ordoño in 865. In consequence of the rebellion of Don Froila, not long after his accession to the throne, he was forced to leave his kingdom; but that usurper being affianced, with universal applause he returned to his throne. In many successful enterprises against the Moors, in which he greatly enlarged his territories, he soon displayed the talents of a warlike and able prince. He formed a powerful alliance against the Moors, by marrying Ximene or Chimene, descended from the house of Navarre, which paved the way for a long series of victories. The great attention which he paid to the comfort and welfare of the common people, greatly disgusted his haughty nobles; which excited them to revolt against him in the advanced part of his life. Enjoying a small interval of tranquility from the distraction and tumults of war, he called a general council of the clergy and nobility, enacted some useful regulations, and directed their attention to several other subjects, which contributed to the honour and happiness of his kingdom. Whilst he was busily occupied in repairing some of those towns which he had taken from the Moors, he was suddenly interrupted by them, and was under the necessity of defending himself with a considerable army, which he did with such success, that they were defeated with great loss. The unnatural rebellion of his son Don Garcias, at this time, greatly disturbed his government; but by the diligence of the father, this unnatural rebellion was soon quelled. The confinement of Garcias, and the new imposition of taxes, produced general murmurs among the people; which induced Alphonso, now worn out with years and incessant contentions, to assemble the states, and resign the reins of government into the hands of his son Don Garcias. He gave to his other son Don Ordoño the province of Galicia. The ambitious and military spirit which Don Garcias discovered in his father's reign, soon displayed itself in an attack on the Moors. By the advice of his father, to which he prudently listened, he was taught that these new conquests tended more to enrich the soldiers, than to the advantage of the crown. Alphonso, although far advanced in years, took upon himself the command of the army raised for new operations, and returned to Zamora loaded with spoils, and with increased reputation and fame, in the year 912. He died December 20th, 912, two years after his abdication, 49 years from the time of his being associated with his father in the government, and when he was about 63 or 65 years of age. His great learning, and the patronage he gave to literature, his distinguished piety and virtue, and other princely qualities, raised this king high in the estimation of mankind. Some writers affirm that he composed a chronicle of the Spanish affairs, from the death of Receifuintho, to that of his own father Don Ordoño, which has been incorrectly published by Sandovel, Alphonso, and the later editions has sustained considerable injury. The bishop of Orenfa, at whose request it was originally composed, published it in his own name to the world. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlphonso X the Wise, king of Leon and Castile, succeeded his father Ferdinand in the year 1252. He obtained the appellation of wise, not for his political knowledge as a king, but his erudition as a philosopher. In consequence of the general opinion of his princely qualities, and his uncommon generosity, he ascended the throne with universal approbation. The ill-concerted projects of his ambition, however, disturbed the prosperity of his reign. Pretending a better right than Henry III of England to that territory, he directed his first attempt against Gascony. The arms of England, however, proved too formidable; and he was compelled to renounce his claim, on condition that Henry's son, afterwards King Edward I, should marry his sister Eleonora. At an expense which drained his treasuries, and obliged him to debauch his coin, he prepared for an expedition against the Moors in Barbary; but his maternal right to the duchy of Swabia, which he was called to defend, diverted him from it. Thus he formed a connexion with the German princes; and became a competitor, with Richard earl of Cornwall, for the imperial crown, in quest of which they both expended immense sums of money. The claims of several of the princes of the blood, gave exercise to his military talents; and he was successful both in opposing and defeating them. He formed the romantic design of visiting Italy in the year 1268; but the states firmly remonstrating, he was obliged to relinquish it. But, although he abandoned the design, yet it produced such discontentments both among the common people and conspiracy among the nobles, that it required considerable exertion before the king could allay the ferment. Alphonso, still anxious of ascending the imperial throne, attempted it after the death of Richard earl of Cornwall, and even after Rodolph of Hapsburg was actually elected emperor of Germany, and for that purpose took a journey to Beaucaire to obtain an interview with the pope, in order to prevent him from confirming the election. The Moors, ever ready to draw the sword against him, took this opportunity of entering his dominions for the purpose of ravaging them. This ambitious journey, undertaken at so vast an expense, and productive of so much confusion in his kingdom, proved unsuccessful; for the pope would not realize his claim, or alter the former election. But his excessive ambition was soon punished by domestic calamity; for his eldest son died in this interval, and his second son Don Sanchez, having obtained great reputation in opposing the infidels, to the prejudice of his brother's children, laid claim to the crown. This claim was admitted by the states of the kingdom; but Philip king of France, supporting the cause of the children, whose mother was his sister Blanche of France, involved Alphonso in a war; and it occasioned the retreat of his own queen Yolande or Violante to the court of her father, the king of Arragon. While thus harassed with dissensions, he proclaimed war against France, and by the authority of the pope he renewed the war with the Moors, which proved to unfortunate, that he reluctantly concluded a truce with them, and engaged in a contest\nAlphonso, with the king of Granada. These various measures exhausted his treasure, taxes were multiplied, and the affairs of the kingdom were in such confusion, that he was under the disagreeable necessity of calling an assembly of the states, which was held at Seville in the year 1281, where, on the king's proposal, the states consented to give a currency to copper money. In consequence of the intrigues of Don Sanchez his son, another assembly of the states was held at Valladolid A.D. 1282, which deprived Alphonso of the regal dignity, and appointed Sanchez regent. Reduced to almost insurmountable difficulties, Alphonso solemnly cursed and disinherited his son, and by his last will, in the year 1283, confirmed the act of exclusion, and appointed, for the succession, the infants de la Cerda, and upon the failure of their heirs the kings of France; and at the same time supplicated the affiance of the king of Morocco against the power of his son. At the commencement of the next year, when Alphonso received information, from Salamanca, that Sanchez was dangerously ill, his heart relented. He pardoned his son, revoked his curses, and then died on the 4th of April 1284 in the 81st year of his age. His remains were interred in the cathedral of Seville; and he left behind him the character of a learned man, but a weak king. Alphonso has been charged with irreligion and impiety, chiefly on account of a well-known saying of his, viz., \"if he had been of God's privy-council when he created the world he could have advised him better.\" The various contradictory accounts, given by different writers render the truth of this doubtful; but if ever such a horrible saying dropt from his lips, it must unquestionably be declared inconsistent with the character of an enlightened philosopher; and that reverence of the Creator, which an enlarged contemplation of his works naturally inspires.\n\n\"An indecent astronomer is mad,\" Young.\n\nHe was an eminent proficient in science, and a patron of literature. He concluded that book of laws, known by the title of Las Partidas, which his father had begun; and in that work displayed the abilities of a politician as well as those of a legislator. By obliging his subjects to use their own language, he redressed the confusion in law proceedings occasioned by intermixing Latin with the vulgar tongue. Under his patronage a general history of Spain was composed, which he took great pains in polishing; he also corrected many errors in the statutes of the university of Salamanca. Astronomy being his favourite study, he chiefly directed his attention to the improvement of that science; so that, even during the life of his father, he assembled at Toledo a number of the most celebrated astronomers of his time, Christians, Jews, and Arabs, from all parts of Europe, for the purpose of examining the astronomical tables of Ptolemy, and correcting their errors. The completion of these tables employed them about four years, and in 1252, the first year of Alphonso's reign, they were completed; and they were called Alphonso Tables from the name of this prince, who encouraged the construction of them by his unbounded liberality. It is reported that 400,000 ducats were expended on them, or, according to others, 40,000. Some have ascribed the principal management of this work to the Jewish Rabbi Isaac Aben-Said; others, pretending to derive information from the MSS. of Alphonso, refer it to Aben-Ragée and Alcabitius. The other astronomers who were employed on this occasion were Aben-Mufa Mohammed, Joseph Ben-Ali, and Jacob Abuena, Arabians: if there were any Christians, their names are unknown. The 30th of May 1252, which was the day of his accession to the throne, was fixed as the epoch of these tables. A book, entitled \"The Treasure,\" is also ascribed to him, containing treatises of rational philosophy, physics, and ethics. He is likewise said to have been well acquainted with astrology and chemistry; in which last science, he is said to have compiled two volumes in cipher, which are extant, and to be found full in his Catholic Majesty's library. But this work must be more curious than useful, if we consider the state of this science at that period. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlphonso V. king of Arragon and Naples, succeeded his father in the year 1416. As the father had formerly been honoured with the appellation of Just, so the son was honoured with that of Magnanimous. The conspiracy of some of his own nobles against his life, together with the insolence of Pope Benedict XIII., greatly disturbed the tranquillity of his reign. Fortunately this conspiracy was discovered just when it was about to be carried into execution; and instead of proceeding with rigour against the conspirators, he generously tore a paper containing their names without reading it, and added, \"that he would at least force them to acknowledge, that he had a greater regard for their lives than they had for his.\" After quelling a disturbance in Sardinia, he was just making preparations to advance to Sicily, when Joan of Naples offered, if he would assist her against the pope, the duke of Anjou, and the comte Sforza, who had formed a confederacy to depose her, to adopt him as her son and heir. He readily accepted the proposal, and with a powerful army soon raised the siege of Naples, and was immediately declared heir apparent of her kingdom, and duke of Calabria. But as the queen was unfaithful, and did not fulfil her engagements, Alphonso took possession of Naples, and expelled her from it; but when the duke of Anjou again entered her territories, and made himself master of great part of them, she was obliged to renew her solicitations to Alphonso; who, in the year 1434, involved himself in a quarrel with the duke of Milan and the republic of Genoa, by besieging Gaeta in a second attempt to conquer Naples. The Genoese fleet engaged Alphonso; and all his ships were dispersed or destroyed, and himself taken prisoner. But such was the address of this prince, that when carried to Milan a prisoner, he there ingratiated himself to much into the duke's favour, that he became his friend and ally, and soon rose to greater power than formerly.\n\nHe got possession of Naples in 1443; and in an assembly of the states held at Beneventum, and then transferred to Naples, his sovereignty was recognized, and his son, Don Ferdinand, declared successor to the throne, and in consequence of this elevation he was deemed the sole arbiter of peace and war through all Italy. Naples became the residence of Alphonso during the remainder of his life; but his declining years were much disquieted by political dissensions and intrigues. The natural attendant of jealous old age at\nAlphonso last feigned him; and in conformation and dread, he was removed from one castle of Naples to another, until he breathed his last on the 22d of June 1468, bequeathing to his natural son Ferdinand the kingdom of Naples, and to his brother Don Juan, king of Navarre, the kingdoms of Arragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia, Sicily, and the principality and dependencies of Catalonia. Alphonso was not only deemed the ablest statesman, and the most renowned military commander in that age, but also the greatest prince that ever occupied the throne of Arragon. He was a distinguished patron of learning, and opened an asylum for the Greek literati expelled from Constantinople. His device was an open book. He frequently uttered this expression, \"That an unlettered prince was but a crowned ass.\" He was brave and liberal; and in all his negotiations he disdained the mean arts of intrigue and dissimulation. It is reported that his personal Quintus Curtius cured him of a disorder with which he was attacked at Capua. Such was his familiar intercourse with his subjects, and his affection towards them, that he walked unarmed and unaccompanied in his capital; and was wont to say, \"that a father has nothing to fear in the midst of his children.\" While he was besieging Gaeta he dismissed the women and children that were turned out of the town without any injury, saying, \"That he had rather lose any city in his dominions than lose the reputation of humanity.\" He leaped into a shallop for the relief of one of his galleys, which with its whole crew and soldiers was just about to perish, exclaiming, \"I had rather share than witness their calamity.\" Such was his generosity, that upon hearing an officer who saw his treasure bringing him 10,000 ducats, exclaiming, \"I should only with that sum to make me happy.\" \"You shall be so,\" said Alphonso, and gave him the money in a present. He deemed dancing a certain degree of madness; but was strongly addicted to women, which involved him in many dishonourable intrigues, and justly entailed upon him the disgrace of an unfaithful husband to a kind and affectionate queen. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nALPHONSUS TOSTATUS, bishop of Avila, a learned and voluminous Spanish writer. He flourished about the middle of the 15th century, and by his uncommon abilities rose to the highest offices both in the civil and ecclesiastical departments of the state. At the age of 22 years he finished his studies at the university of Salamanca, having made great progress in every branch of learning then in estimation. He was present at the council of Basil, and was afterwards promoted to the bishopric of Avila. He died at the age of 40 years, in 1454, and was buried in the church of Avila. The following epitaph, expressive of his great erudition, was inscribed on his tomb.\n\nHie stupor est mundi qui scibile discebit omne.\n\n\"This is the wonder of the world who treated of everything that could be known.\"\n\nThe numerous productions of Alphonsus are sufficient proofs of his laborious industry: during his life he wrote no less than 27 volumes in folio, of which 24 are commentaries on the Scriptures; the rest are on theological subjects. By the order of Cardinal Ximenes they were printed at Venice in 1530, and in 1596; and at Cologne in 1612. Several of his pieces on ecclesiastical history, science, and literature in general, were separately printed at Salamanca in 1560, and also his commentary upon the Chronicon of Eusebius. Although high encomiums have been bestowed upon his works, they have nevertheless in the current of time and human improvement fallen into oblivion. (Dupin.)\n\nALPINI, PROSPERO, in Latin, Prosper Alpinus, a celebrated physician and botanist, was born at Marofica in the republic of Venice in November 1553. In his early years his inclination led him to the profession of arms, and he served some time in the Milanese. By the encouragement and persuasion of his father, who was a physician, he retired from the army, and devoted his attention to literature. To prosecute his studies with more advantage, he went to the university of Padua, where he was soon after elected deputy to the rector and syndic to the students. But in the discharge of his official duties which was distinguished by prudence and address, he was not prevented from pursuing the study of physic which he had chosen. He continued his medical studies with zeal and success; and after having acquired the necessary qualifications, he was admitted to the degree of doctor of medicine in 1578. Soon after he left the university, and settled as a physician in consequence of an invitation from the citizens in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan territory.\n\nIn the course of his studies he had paid particular attention to plants, and had become an enthusiast in botanical science. The sphere of his present practice was too limited to afford him much opportunity of prosecuting his favourite study. He wished particularly to extend his knowledge of exotic plants; and the only means to attain this, he thought, was to study their economy and habits in their native soil. And to gratify this laudable curiosity an opportunity soon presented itself. George Emo, the consul for the Venetian republic in Egypt, appointed Alpini his physician. They sailed from Venice in September 1580; and after having experienced a tedious and dangerous voyage, arrived at Grand Cairo in the beginning of July the following year. Alpini spent three years in Egypt, and by his industry and assiduity, greatly improved his botanical knowledge. With this view he travelled along the banks of the Nile, visited every place, and consulted every person from whom he expected any new information. From a practice in the management of date trees which he observed in this country, Alpini seems to have deduced the doctrine of the sexual difference of plants which was adopted as the foundation of the celebrated system of Linnaeus. He says, \"That the female date trees, or palms, do not bear fruit, unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath, or male flowers, is sprinkled over the female flowers.\"\n\nWhen Alpini returned to Venice in 1586 he was appointed physician to Andrea Doria prince of Melfi, and during his residence at Genoa, acquired to great a name as to be esteemed the first physician of his age. The Venetians became jealous that the Genoese state should number among its citizens a person of such distinguished merit and reputation, whose services might be:\nAlpini be essentially beneficial, and whose fame might be highly honourable to his native country. In the year 1593, he was recalled to fill the botanical chair in the university of Padua, with a salary of 200 florins, which was afterwards augmented to 750. He discharged the duties of his professorship for many years with great reputation, till his declining health interrupted his labours. He died in the year 1617, in the 64th year of his age, and was succeeded as botanical professor by one of his sons. Alpini wrote the following works in Latin:\n\n1. *De Medicina Ægyptiorum, libri iv.* \"Of the Physic of the Egyptians, in four books;\" printed at Venice, 1591, in 4to.\n\n2. *De Plantis Ægypti liber:* \"A treatise concerning the plants of Egypt;\" printed at Venice, 1592, in 4to.\n\n3. *De Balsamo Dialogus:* \"A dialogue concerning the Balm of Gilead;\" printed at Venice, 1529, in 4to.\n\n4. *De Praefagienda vita et morte ægrotantium libri vii:* \"Seven books concerning the method of forming a judgment of the life or death of patients;\" printed at Venice, 1601, in 4to.\n\n5. *De Medicina medica,* libri xiii: \"Thirteen books concerning methodical Physic.\" Padua, 1611, folio; Leyden, 1719, in 4to.\n\n6. *De Rhapontico Disputatione:* \"A disputation held in the school at Padua concerning the Rhaponticum;\" Padua, 1612, and 1629, in 4to.\n\n7. *De Plantis Exoticis, libri ii:* \"Of exotic plants, in two books;\" Venice, 1699, in 4to.\n\nHe left several other works, which have never been printed; particularly,\n\n8. The fifth book concerning the physic of the Egyptians.\n\n9. Five books concerning the natural history of things observed in Egypt, adorned with figures of plants, stones, and animals. (Biog. Diet.)\n\nALPINIA. See Botany Index.\n\nALPINUS. See Alpini.\n\nALPISTE, or ALPIA, a sort of feed used to feed birds with, especially when they are to be nourished for breeding. The alpiste seed is of an oval figure, of a pale yellow, inclining to an Isabel colour, bright and glossy. It is an article of the corn-chandlers and seedmen's trade.\n\nALPS, in Ancient Geography, a range of high mountains, separating Italy from Gaul and Germany, in the form of a crescent. They take their rise from the Vada Sabatia, or Savona; and reach to the Sinus Flavianicus (now Golfo di Carnaro of the Adriatic), and the springs of the river Colapis (now the Kulpe); extending, according to Livy, 2000 stadia in length, or 250 miles: they are divided into several parts, and accordingly have different names. From Savona to the springs of the Varus, where the Alps lie against the sea of Genoa, they are called Maritima, now le Montagne di Tenda. These extend from south to north, between Gaul to the west, and Genoa to the east, beginning at Monaco on the Mediterranean; then running out through the east of the county of Nice, and between that and the marquisate of Saluzzo, terminate at length at Mount Vilo, between Dauphiné and Piedmont. Hence to Susa run the Alpes Cottiae (Sueton.) Cotane (Tacitus); mountains extremely high, separating Dauphiné from Piedmont, and extending from Mount Vilo to Mount Cenis, between the Alpes Maritimae to the south, and the Graiae to the north. The Alpes Graiae (Pliny), so called from the pass of Hercules, begin from Mount Cenis, where the Cottiae terminate; and run out between Savoy and the Tarentese to the west, and Piedmont and the Duché d'Aouife to the east, quite to the Great St Bernard, where the Alpes Pennine begin. They are also called by some Graiae Alpes, and Graiae Mons (Tacitus); which extend from west to east, between St Bernard and the Adula, or St Gothard; and thus they run out between the Valais to the north, and the Milanese to the south. With these are continued the Alpes Rhaetiae, to the head of the river Piave; a part of which are the Alpes Tridentinae, to the north of Trent. To these join the Alpes Noricae, reaching to Doblach in Tyrol, to the north of the river Tajamento: thence begin the Alpes Carnicae, or of Carniola, extending to the springs of the Save: and the last, called Alpes Pannonicae, and Julie, extend to the springs of the Kulpe. Some, however, extend the Alps to the north of Dalmatia; others, again, to Thrace and the Euxine. But their termination at the Kulpe, as above, is more generally received. They were formerly called Albia, and Alpionia (Strabo). Through these mountains Hannibal forced his passage into Italy, by pouring vinegar on the rocks, heated by burning large piles of wood on them, by which means they became crumbled, (Livy). They are covered with perpetual snow.\n\nThe Alps are the highest mountains in Europe; being, according to some geometricians, about two miles in perpendicular height. They begin at the Mediterranean; and stretching northward, separate Piedmont and Savoy from the adjacent countries; whence directing their course to the east, they form the boundary between Switzerland and Italy, and terminate near the extremity of the Adriatic sea, north-east of Venice. It was over the western part of those mountains, towards Piedmont, that Hannibal forced his passage into Italy.\n\nThe prospect from many parts of this enormous range of mountains is extremely romantic, especially towards the north-west. One of the most celebrated is the Grande Chartreuse, where is a monastery founded by St Bruno about the year 1084. From Echelles, a little village in the mountains of Savoy, to the top of the Chartreuse, the distance is six miles. Along this course, the road runs winding up, for the most part not five feet broad. On one hand is the rock, with woods of pine trees hanging over head; on the other a prodigious precipice almost perpendicular; at the bottom of which rolls a torrent, that sometimes tumbling among the fragments of stone which have fallen from on high, and sometimes precipitating itself down vast descents with a noise like thunder, rendered yet more tremendous by the echo from the mountains on each side, concurs to form one of the most solemn, the most romantic, and most astonishing scenes in nature. To this description may be added the strange views made by the crags and cliffs, and the numerous cascades which throw themselves from the very summit down into the vale. On the top of the mountain is the convent of St Bruno, which is the superior of the whole order. The inhabitants consist of 100 fathers, with 300 servants, who grind their corn, press their wine, and perform every domestic office, even to the making of their clothes. In the Album of the fathers is an admired alcaic ode, written by the late ingenious Mr Gray when he visited the Chartreuse, and which has since been published among his works.\n\nThe glaciers of Savoy are also justly reckoned among the\nthe most stupendous works of nature. These are immense masses of ice, lodged upon the gentler declivities amidst the Alps, and exhibiting representations beyond conception fantastic and picturesque. In the extraordinary narrative of M. Bourrit's journey hither, we meet with the following account of the Prieuré, in the valley of Chamouni. \"We had (says he) the magnificent prospect of a chain of mountains, equally inaccessible, and covered with ice; and above the rest that of Mount Blanc, whose top seemed to reach, and even pierce, the highest region of the clouds. The chain upon which this mountain looks down like a giant, is composed of masses of rocks, which terminate in pikes or spires, called the Needles, and which are ranged like tents in a camp. Their sides appear lighter and more airy, from the ornament of several hollow breaks and furrows fretted in the rock itself, as well as from the different streaks and panes of ice and snow, which, without changing the general character of their form, or the majesty of their appearance, give them a picturesque variety. Lower down, the eye surveys with ravishment the gills of ice, and the several glaciers, extending almost into the plain, whilst this appears like an artificial garden, embellished with the mixture of a variety of colours. We have a picturesque opposition to this chain, which is formed by innumerable mountains at the distance of near 50 leagues, between whose tops we have a glimpse of those several plains which they environ.\"\n\nM. de Saufure, who had visited those mountains about two months before M. Bourrit, felt himself naturally electrified in this place. This extraordinary phenomenon seems not to have been experienced by the latter or his company; but they heard a long-continued rumbling noise like that of thunder, which was rendered more awful by the silence of the place where they stood. This noise proceeded from the subsequent causes, viz. the avalanches of snow, which separated from the tops of the mountains, and rolled down to the bottom; considerable fragments of the rocks which followed them, overturning others in their fall; and muddy blocks of ice, which precipitated from the summits.\n\nThe valley of Montanvert appears to be peculiarly romantic. \"Here (says M. Bourrit) we behold a spacious icy plain entirely level. Upon this there rose a mountain all of ice, with steps ascending to the top, which seemed the throne of some divinity. It likewise took the form of a grand facade, whose figure was beyond conception beautiful; and the sun, which shone upon it, gave a sparkling brilliance to the whole. The valley on our right hand was ornamented with prodigious glaciers, that shooting up to an immeasurable height between the mountains, blend their colours with the skies, which they appear to reach.\"\n\nAlps, besides its proper signification, by which it denotes a certain chain of mountains which separate Italy from France and Germany, is frequently used as an appellative to denote any mountains of extraordinary height or extensive range. In this sense, Aulonius and others call the Pyrenean mountains Alps; and Gellius the Spanish Alps, Alpini Hispani.\n\nHence also we say, the British Alps, the Asiatic Alps, the Alps of America.\n\nThe Scottish Alps terminate in a most sublime and abrupt manner, at the great promontory, the Alta Ripa of Ptolemy, the Ord or Aird, i.e. the Height of Caithness. The upper part is covered with gloomy heath; the lower is a stupendous precipice, excavated into vast caverns, the haunt of seals and different sea fowl. On the eastern side of the kingdom, this is the striking termination of the vast mountains of Scotland which form its Highlands, the habitation of the original inhabitants, driven from their ancient seats by the ancestors of Lowland Scots, descendants of Saxons, French, and Normans; congeners with the English, yet absurdly and invincibly distinguished from them. Language, as well as striking natural boundaries, mark their place. Their mountains face on the west the Atlantic ocean; wind along the west of Caithness; among which Morven and Scaraben, Ben Hop, and Ben Lugal, arise pre-eminent. Sutherland is entirely alpine, as are Rossshire and Invernessshire. Their Summer Alps are, Meal-Fourvounich, the Corvarill, Benewich, and Benevich near Fort William; the last of which is reported to be 14,59 yards in height. Great part of Aberdeenshire lies in this tract. It boasts of another Morven, roaring far beyond the others. This is the centre of the Grampian hills, and perhaps the highest from the sea of any in Great Britain. They again comprehend the eastern part of Perthshire, and finish on the magnificent shores of Lochlomond; on the western side of which Benlomond rises, distinguished among its fellows. From hence the rest of North Britain forms a chain of humbler hills; but in Cumberland, part of Westmorland, Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Derbyshire, the Alps resume their former majesty. A long and tame interval succeeds. The long sublime tract of Wales arises, the ancient possession of the ancient British race. From the Ord, the great mountains recede inland, and leave a vast flat between their bales and the sea, frouting the waves with a series of lofty rocky precipices, as far as the little creek of Staxigo; the whole a bold, but most inhospitable shore for shipping. Wick and Staxigo have indeed their creeks, or rather chasms, which open between the cliffs, and may accidentally prove a retreat, unless in an eastern gale.\n\nThe Asiatic Alps are described under the articles Altai Chain and Wentarian Mountains.\n\nThe American Alps are, The Andes or Cordilleras, in South America; and the Appalachian or Alleghany mountains in North America.\n\nThe highest ground in North America is placed by Captain Carver in lat 47° W. Long, from London 68°, between a lake from which the Oregon flows, and another called White-bear Lake, from which arises the Mississippi.\n\nThis exalted situation is part of the Shining Mountains, which are branches of the vast chain which pervades the whole continent of America. It may be fairly taken from the southern extremity, where Staten Land and Terra del Fuego rise out of the sea as insulated links to an immense height, black, rocky, and marked with rugged spiny tops, frequently covered with snow. New Georgia may be added as another horribly congenial, rising detached farther to the east. The mountains about the straits of Magellan soar to an amazing height, and infinitely superior to those of the northern hemisphere under the same degree of latitude. From the north side of the straits of Magellan,\nIan, they form a continued chain through the kingdoms of Chili and Peru, preserving a course not remote from the Pacific ocean. The summits, in many places, are the highest in the world. There are not less than 12, which are from 2400 toises high to above 3000. Pichincha, which impends over Quito, is about 35 leagues from the sea; and its summit is 2430 toises above the surface of the water. Cayambe, immediately under the equator, is above 3000; and Chimborazo higher than the last by 200. Most of them have been volcanic, and in different ages marked with eruptions far more horrible than have been known in other quarters of the globe. They extend from the equator through Chili; in which kingdom is a range of volcanoes, from lat. 26. south, to 45. 30. and possibly from thence into Terra del Fuego itself; which, forming the straits of Magellan, may have been rent from the continent by some great convulsion, occasioned by their labours, and New Georgia forced up from the same cause. An unparalleled extent of plain appears on their eastern side. The river of Amazon runs along a level clothed with forests, after it bursts from its confinement at the Pongo de Berjas, till it reaches its sea-like discharge into the Atlantic ocean.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the Andes pass through the narrow isthmus of Darien into the kingdom of Mexico, and preserve a majestic height and their volcanic disposition. The mountain Popocatepec made a violent eruption during the expedition of Cortez, which is most beautifully described by his historian Antonio de Solis. This is probably the same with the volcano observed by the Abbé d'Auteroche, in his way from Vera Cruz to Mexico; which, from the nakedness of the lavas, he conjectured to have been but lately extinguished. From the kingdom of Mexico, this chain is continued northward, and to the east of California; then verges so greatly towards the west, as to leave a very inconsiderable space between it and the Pacific ocean; and frequently detached branches jut into the sea, and form promontories; which, with parts of the chain itself, were often seen by our navigators in the course of their voyage. Some branches, as we have before observed, extend towards the east, but not to any great distance. A plain, rich in woods and savannahs, swarming with bisons or buffaloes, flags, and Virginian deer, with bears, and a great variety of game, occupies an amazing tract, from the great lakes of Canada, as low as the gulf of Mexico; and eastward to the other great chain of mountains, the Appalachian, which are the Alps of that side of northern America. Its commencement is supposed to be about Lake Champlain and Lake George, with branches pointing obliquely to the river St Lawrence eastward, and rising on its opposite coasts; others extending as far as Nova Scotia, but in their progress eastward diminish in height. The main chain passes through the province of New York, where it is distinguished by the name of the Highlands, and lies within 40 miles of the Atlantic. From thence it recedes from the sea, in proportion as it advances southward; and near its extremity in South Carolina is 300 miles distant from the water. It consists of several parallel ridges divided by most enchanting valleys, and generally clothed with variety of woods. These ridges rise gradually from the east, one above the other, to the central; from which they gradually fall to the west, into the vast plains of the Mississippi. The middle ridge is of an enormous bulk and height. The whole extends in breadth about 70 miles; and in many places leaves great chasms for the discharge of the vast and numerous rivers which rise in the bottoms of the mountains, and empty themselves into the Atlantic ocean, after yielding a matchless navigation to the provinces they water.\n\nBeyond the branch of the Appalachian mountains called The Endless, is another of amazing extent, nearly as high as the mountains themselves. This plain (called the Upper Plains) is exceedingly rich land; begins at the Mohocks river; reaches to within a small distance of Lake Ontario; and to the westward forms part of the extensive plains of the Ohio, and reaches to an unknown distance beyond the Mississippi. Vast rivers take their rise, and fall to every point of the compass; into Lake Ontario, into Hudson's river, and into the Delaware and Susquehanna. The tide of Hudson's river flows through its deep-worn bed far up, even to within a small distance of the head of the Delaware; which, after a furious course down a long descent, interrupted with rapids, meets the tide not very remote from its discharge into the ocean.\n\nLower Alps, Department of, in France. This department is one of four into which the former Provence is divided. It is bounded on the north by the department of the Upper Alps; on the east by Piedmont, and the department of the Maritime Alps; on the south, by the department of the Var, and the northeast extremity of that of the Mouths of the Rhone; and on the west, by the departments of Vaucluse and the Drome; the chief town is Digne; its superficies is about 1,459,699 square acres; population 144,436 individuals. It is divided into five communal districts.\n\nUpper Alps, Department of. This department makes a part of Dauphiné, which contains three. It is bounded on the north by the departments of Mont Blanc and Isere; on the east by Piedmont; on the south, by the department of the Lower Alps; on the west, by that of the Drome, and part of that of Isere; Embrun is the principal town; its superficies is about 1,084,614 square acres; population 116,754 individuals. It is divided into three communal districts.\n\nMaritime Alps, Department of. This department is formed of the county of Nice. It is bounded on the north by the Apennines and the department of the Lower Alps; on the east, by the republic of Genoa; on the south, by the Mediterranean; and on the west, by the departments of the Var and Lower Alps: the principal town is Nice; its superficies is about 632,619 square acres; population 93,366 souls. It is divided into three communal districts.\n\nAlpujarras, or Alpaxares, mountains of Spain, in the province of Granada, on the coast of the Mediterranean sea. They are about 17 leagues in length and 11 in breadth, reaching from the city of Velez to Almeria. They are inhabited by Moors, who are the remains of the dispersion and ruin of their empire. They embraced the Christian religion; but preserve their own manner of living, and their language, though much corrupted. Here is a rivulet between Pitros\nPitros and Portugos, which dyes linen that is dipped in it black in an instant. Near this rivulet is a cavern, from which proceeds so malignant a steam, that it destroys such animals as come near it. The Morifcos cultivate the soil extremely well, and plant fruit trees; some of which grow to a prodigious height and thickness, and give the mountains a very agreeable aspect.\n\nALQUIER, a liquid measure used in Portugal to measure oil, two of which make an almond. See ALMOND.\n\nALQUIFOU, or ARQUIFOU, is a sort of lead ore, which, when broken, looks like antimony. It is used by the potters to give a green varnish to their works, and thence is called potters ore. It is met with in Cornwall, &c. The potters mix a small portion of manganese with the alquifou, and then the varnish or glazing on their ware is of a blackish hue.\n\nALREDUS, ALURED, or ALREDUS, of Beverley, one of the most ancient English historians, was born at Beverley in Yorkshire. He wrote in the reign of Henry I. There are no circumstances of his life known with any degree of certainty. It is generally believed that he was educated at Cambridge, and that he afterwards became one of the canons and treasurer of St John's at Beverley. And we learn in a note of Bishop Tanner's, that, for the sake of improvement, he travelled through France and Italy; and at Rome became domestic chaplain to Cardinal Othoboni. He died in the year 1128 or 1129, leaving behind him the following works: 1. The Annals of Alured of Beverley; which was published at Oxford in 1716, by Mr Hearne, from a manuscript which belonged to Thomas Rawlinson, Esq. It contains an abridgment of our history from Brutus to Henry I., written in Latin, and with great accuracy, elegance, and perspicuity. 2. Libertates ecclesiae S. Johannis de Beverlac, &c. a manuscript in the Cottonian library. It is a collection of records relative to the church of Beverley, translated from the Saxon language. These are the only works which were written by Alredus. (Biog. Dict.)\n\nALRESFORD, a town of Hampshire, seated on the road from London to Southampton, close by the river Itching, which feeds a great pond to the left of the town. Part of a Roman highway runs from hence to Alton. It consists of about 200 houses; has one church, and two principal streets, which are large and broad; and has a small manufacture of linens. It is 57 miles distant from London.\n\nALSA, in Ancient Geography, a river of Carniola (Pliny), now the Aysa, running by Aquileia, with a short course from north to south, into the Adriatic; where Constantine, the son of Constantine the Great, fighting against Constans his brother, lost his life.\n\nALSACE, formerly a province of France, bounded on the east by the Rhine, on the south by Switzerland, on the west by Lorraine, and on the north by the palatinate of the Rhine. It was formerly a part of Germany, but was given to France by the treaty of Münster. It is one of the most fruitful and plentiful provinces of Europe, abounding in corn, wine, wood, flax, tobacco, pulse, fruits, &c. The mountains which divide it from Lorraine are very high; and generally covered with fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam.\n\nThose on the side of Switzerland are less high; and are furnished with all sorts of wood, as well for fuel as building. The country itself is diversified with rising hills and fertile vales, besides large forests; but that between the rivers Ill, Hart, and the Rhine, as far as Strasbourg, is inferior to the rest, on account of the frequent overflowing of the Rhine. In High Alsace there are mines of silver, copper, and lead. They however work none but those of Giromany, from which are annually drawn 1600 marks of silver, each mark being eight ounces; and 24,000 pounds of copper; but the expense of working them is almost equal to the profit. There are iron works in several parts of Alsace, and particularly at Betzendorf. There is a mineral spring at Sulzbach, near Munster, in High Alsace; which is in great reputation for the palsy, weakness of the nerves, and the gravel.—The original inhabitants of Alsace are honest and good natured, but wedded to their own manners and customs. The fruitfulness of their country renders them indolent and inactive; for the Swiss make their hay and reap their corn, as well as manage the vintage of High Alsace, which sends a great deal of money out of the province. The common language is the German; but the better sort of people in the towns speak French; and, even in the country, they speak French well enough to be understood.\n\nThe number of inhabitants was formerly computed at about half a million, who are mostly Lutherans and Roman Catholics. By the late division of France this province forms two departments, viz. those of the Upper and Lower Rhine; the capital of the former being Colmar, and that of the latter Strasbourg; but formerly it was divided into Upper and Lower Alsace, the former contained 32 large and small towns, and the latter 39, and in both there are upwards of 1000 market towns and villages. The Rauraci, Sequani, and Mediomatrici, were the ancient inhabitants of this province. Under the Merovingian kings its name first occurs in the history of France, and it most probably is derived from the river Ill or Ill, the inhabitants on the borders of which were called Elsassen, from whom the country itself was afterwards denominated Elsass, in Latin Elsafia, Alsfatia, and Alsatia. The Romans wrested it from the Celts; from them it passed into the hands of the Germans; and after the famous battle of Tolbiac, gained by Clovis in 496, it passed into the possession of the Franks. It was incorporated at a future period with the kingdom of Austrasia; and, in 1752, it was subjected, like the rest of the monarchy, to the laws of Pepin and his successors. Lotharius, the eldest son of Lewis Debonnaire, at the decease of his father in 840, obtained it and united it to that part of the empire of the Franks which fell to him, and was generally known by the name of Lotharingia, or Lorraine. Afterwards it fell to his youngest son Lotharius by inheritance; and after him, in 869, it became a province of Germany, and was governed by dukes.\n\nAbout a century before the title of dukes was abolished, the provincial counts who governed under them in Alsace, assumed the title of Landgraver, and the countries over which they presided, obtained the name of Landgravate, the one superior and the other inferior. The best part of the inferior was conveyed to the bishops of Strasbourg in 1375, who assumed the title\ntitle of Landgrave of Alsace. In after times, the government was given by the emperors to several families, until at last Ferdinand I. bestowed it upon the German line of his own family, and consequently it remained in the house of Austria. The property of the town of Brisac, the landgrave of the Upper and Lower Alsace, Sundgau, and the districts of the ten united imperial cities in Alsace, with the whole sovereignty belonging to them, was for ever ceded by the emperor to the crown of France, at the peace of Munster in 1648. The perpetual sovereignty of the city of Strasbourg, together with all its dependencies on the left of the Rhine, were ceded to France by the peace of Ryswick in 1697.\n\nALSEN, an island of Denmark, situated in the Lefter Belt, or entrance into the Baltic sea, between Sleiwick and Funen, 100 miles west of Copenhagen. It extends in length six leagues, and about two in breadth. The soil is fertile, producing abundance of fruit and variety of grain, with large crops of aniseeds, a carminative much used in feasting the food and mixing with the bread all over the Danish dominions. E. Long. 10. 12. N. Lat. 55. 12.\n\nALSFIELD, a town of Germany, in the landgraviate of Hesse Cassel, ten miles north-west of Marpurg, and 35 south of Hesse Cassel. It is an ancient town, and well built; and the inhabitants were the first of this country who embraced the Reformation. E. Long. 9. 5. N. Lat. 50. 40.\n\nALSHASH, a very beautiful city in Bucharia, supposed to be the same with that which is now called Taibacant, the capital of the eastern part of Turkestan, policed by the Kaffirs. It is situated on the river Sichun, now Sir, and had a well watered garden for every house; but was ruined by Jenghiz Khan, who took the city, and caused a great number of its inhabitants to be massacred.\n\nALSHEIDA, a parish in the province of Smaland, in Sweden, where a gold mine was discovered in 1738.\n\nALSINA, in Botany, a synonyme of the theligonum. See Theligonum, Botany Index.\n\nALSINASTRUM, in Botany, the trivial name of the elatine. See Elatine, Botany Index.\n\nALSINE, or Chickweed. See Botany Index.\n\nThe common chickweed affords a remarkable instance of what is called the sleep of plants; for, every night, the leaves approach in pairs, so as to include within their upper surfaces the tender rudiments of the new shoots; and the uppermost pair but one at the end of the stalk are furnished with longer leaf-blades than the others; so that they can close upon the terminating pair, and protect the end of the branch.\n\nALSIRAT, in the Mahometan Theology, denotes a bridge laid over the middle of hell, finer than a hair, and sharper than the edge of a sword, over which people are to pass, after their trial, on the day of judgement. To add to the difficulty of the passage, Mahomet affirms, that the alfarat, narrow as it is, is befit with briars and thorns; none of which, however, will be any impediment to the good, who shall fly over it like the wind, Mahomet and his Mussulmans leading the way; whereas the wicked, by the narrowness of the path, the entangling of the thorns, and extinction of the light which directed the former to paradise, will soon miss their footing, and tumble headlong into hell, which is gaping beneath to receive them.\n\nALSIVM, in Ancient Geography, a city of ancient Etruria, occupying (according to Cluverius) the spot on which Pala now stands. We are told by Dionysius Halicarnassensis, that Alium was built by the Aborigines, long before the Tyrrhenians invaded Italy. In this case it must have been founded not long after the dispersion in the days of Peleg. Its founder is said to have been one Alafus, Alafus, or Alifa; whom some conjecture to have been Alifah, or Eliha, the son of Javan, mentioned in Scripture.\n\nALSOP, Anthony, an English divine and poet, was educated at Westminster school, and from thence elected to Christ-church, Oxford, where he took the degree of M.A. in March 1666, and of B.D. in December 1726. On his coming to the university, he was very soon distinguished by Dean Aldrich, and published Fabularum Aesopicarum Defectus, Oxon. 1698, 8vo, with a poetical dedication to Lord Wicount Scudamore, and a preface in which he took part against Dr Bentley in the famous dispute with Mr Boyle. He passed through the usual offices in his college to that of censor with considerable reputation; and for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society committed to his care. In this employment he continued till his merit recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester, who appointed him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own cathedral, together with the rectory of Brightwell in the county of Berks, which afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement, from which he could not be drawn by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more public character and a higher station. In 1717 an action was brought against him by Mrs Elizabeth Astley of Oxford, for a breach of a marriage contract; and a verdict obtained against him for 200l., which probably occasioned him to leave the kingdom for some time. His death, which happened June 10. 1726, was occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door. A quarto volume was published in 1752, under the title of Antonii Allop, Aedis Chrifli olim Alumni, Odorum libri duo. Four English poems of his are in Dodley's Collection, one in Peach's, several in the early volumes of the Gentleman's Magazine, and some in \"The Student.\" Mr Allop is respectfully mentioned by the facetious Dr King of the Commons (Vol. I. p. 236), as having enriched the commonwealth of learning, by \"Translations of Fables from Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic;\" and not least detractingly by Dr Bentley, under the name of \"Tony Allop, a late editor of the Aesopian Fables.\" (Biog. Dict.)\n\nAlsop, Vincent, an English nonconformist divine, was born in Northamptonshire, and educated at St John's college, Cambridge, where he took the degree of Master of Arts. When he received deacon's orders, he went to Rutlandshire, and settled at Oakham, where he was an assistant to the master of the free-school. As he was a man of a sprightly turn, he fell into indifferent company; but was reclaimed by the frequent admonitions of the Reverend Mr Benjamin King. He afterwards married that gentleman's daughter, and becoming a convert to his principles, received\ned ordination in the Presbyterian way, not being satisfied with that which he had from the bishop. He was settled at Wilbee in the county of Northampton, whence he was ejected in 1662, for nonconformity. After this he ventured to preach sometimes at Oakham, and at Wellingborough where he lived, and was once six months in prison for praying by a sick person. A book he wrote against Dr Sherlock in a humorous style, made him well known to the world, and induced Mr Cawton, an eminent nonconformist in Westminster, to recommend him to his congregation for his successor. On receiving this call he quitted Northamptonshire, and came to London, where he preached constantly, and wrote several pieces which were extremely well received by the public. His living in the neighbourhood of the court exposed him to many inconveniences; but these ended with the reign of Charles II, or at least in the beginning of the next reign, when Mr Allop's son engaging in treasonable practices was freely pardoned by King James. After this our divine went frequently to court, and is generally supposed to have been the person who drew the Presbyterians address to that prince for his general indulgence. After the Revolution, Mr Allop gave public testimonies of his attachment to government; yet upon all occasions he spoke very respectfully of King James and retained a very high sense of his clemency in sparing his only son.\n\nThe remainder of his life he spent in the exercise of his ministry, preaching once every Lord's day; besides which he had a Thursday lecture, and was one of the lecturers at Pinner's hall. He lived to a great age, and preserving his spirits to the last, died in May 1793. On grave subjects he wrote with a becoming seriousness; but where wit might properly be shown, he displayed it to great advantage. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr Slater, and his memory will be always preserved by his own learned and elegant writings. Of these the most remarkable, besides his sermons, are, 1. Antipozzo; in vindication of some great truths opposed by Dr William Sherlock, 8vo, 1675. 2. Melius Inquirendum; in answer to Dr Goodman's Compartmental Inquiry, 8vo, 1679. 3. The Mischief of Impolitions; in answer to Dr Stillingtonfleet's Mischief of Separation, 1680. 4. A Faithful Reproof to a False Report, with reference to the Differences among the United Ministers in London, 8vo. (Biog. Brit.)\n\nALSTEDIUS, JOHN HENRY, a German Protestant divine, and one of the most indefatigable writers of the 17th century. He was some time professor of philosophy and divinity at Herborn in the county of Nassau; from thence he went into Transylvania, to be professor at Alba Julia; where he continued till his death, which happened in 1638, in the 50th year of his age. His Encyclopaedia has been much esteemed even by the Roman Catholics; it was printed at Lyons, and sold very well throughout all France. His Theaurus Chronologicus is by some considered as one of his best works, and has gone through several editions. He also wrote Triumphus Bibliicus, to show that the principles of all arts and sciences are to be found in the scriptures. He was a Millenarian; and published, in 1627, a treatise De milie annis, in which he asserted that the reign of the saints on earth was to begin in 1694.\n\nALSTON, CHARLES, M.D., a botanical and medical writer, was born in the west of Scotland in the year 1683. He began his studies at the university of Glasgow, and about this period he had the good fortune to be taken under the patronage of the duchess of Hamilton, which afforded him an opportunity of pursuing the bent of his inclination, by attaching himself to the study of physic. About the age of 33, along with his friend and companion the celebrated Alexander Monro, he went to Leyden, and studied three years under Boerhaave. On their return to their native country, they, in conjunction with Rutherford, Sinclair, and Plummer, undertook departments in the college of Edinburgh, and by their abilities and industry, laid the foundation of that school of physic. The branches of botany and materia medica, were long the favourite studies of his life, consequently he undertook that department, and continued to lecture on them with increasing reputation until his death, which happened in November 1760, at the age of 77 years. His talents appear to have been naturally strong, which he improved and strengthened with great affluency and industry, and employed them successfully in the service of science. In the year 1753, his dissertation on the sexes of plants, in which he combats the doctrine of Linnaeus, was published in the first volume of the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays. The general plan of the work is conducted with much ingenuity, supported by some strong experiments, and although in the opinion of the learned, it has failed in its principal design, yet it must be acknowledged to be one of the best argued pieces on that side of the question. An asperity of language is sometimes used, very unsuitable to a scientific topic; but, however, it is proper to remark, that Linnaeus had given some reasons for this conduct by the nature of some of his descriptions. In the fifth volume of the Edinburgh Medical Essays, we have a short paper by Dr Alston on the efficacy of the powder of tin, to destroy or expel worms from the bowels. He informs us, that he received the prescription from an empiric, who was renowned for his skill in curing persons afflicted with that disease. The patient received the first morning one ounce of tin reduced to powder, and half an ounce each of the two following mornings, and was then purged with the infusion of senna and manna. He speaks with great certainty upon the efficacy of this medicine, which certainly has considerable power in these cases, and may be given to the most delicate subjects with perfect safety. Dr Alston also engaged in a chemical controversy respecting quicklime with Dr Whytt. But the most valuable of all his works, are his lectures on the Materia Medica, which were published in the year 1770, in two volumes 4to. The number of curious and useful facts contained in this book, will tend to secure its reputation, although considerable additions and improvements have been made, since that period, in this branch of science.

It begins at the vast mountain Bogdo, passes above the head of the Irtish, and then takes a course rugged, precipitous, clothed with snow, and rich in minerals, between the Irtish and Oby; then proceeds by the lake Teleskoi, the rift of the Oby; after which it retires, in order to comprehend the great rivers which form the Jenesei, and are locked up in these high mountains; finally under the name of the Saimir, it is uninterruptedly continued to the lake of Baikal. A branch infatuates itself between the sources of the rivers Onon and Ingoda, and those of Ichikoi, accompanied with very high mountains, running without interruption to the northeast, and dividing the river Amur, which discharges itself into the east, in the Chinese dominions, from the river Lena and lake Baikal. Another branch stretches along the Olecma, croffles the Lena below Jakoutsk, and is continued between the two rivers Tougoufka to the Jenesei, where it is lost in wooded and marshy plains. The principal chain, rugged with sharp-pointed rocks, approaches and keeps near the shores of the sea of Ochotz, and passing by the sources of the rivers Outh, Aldan, and Maia, is distributed in small branches, which range between the eastern rivers which fall into the Icy Sea; besides two principal branches, one of which, turning south, runs through all Kamtschatka, and is broken, from the Cape Lopatka, into the numerous Kurile isles, and to the east forms another marine chain, in the Aleutian islands which range from Kamtschatka to America; most of them, as well as Kamtschatka itself, distinguished by volcanoes, or the traces of volcanic fires. The last chain forms chiefly the great Cape Tschutki, with its promontories and rocky broken shores.\n\nThe summits of the highest of the Altai mountains are covered with perpetual snow. The loftiest range of this extensive chain, is composed of granite. Another range of inferior height consists of thiftus, which lies on the sides of the granite mountains. Beside these rocks, there are strata of chalkstone, limestone, and marble. The Altai mountains abound in metallic ores. Gold, silver, and lead mines, have been discovered in them, with great abundance of copper and iron. The two latter have been wrought to a considerable extent, and have been found productive.\n\nALTAMONT, a very handsome town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in Calabria Citerior, 15 miles north-west of Bagniano.

Some were round, others square, and others triangular. All of them were turned towards the east, and stood lower than the statues of the gods; and were generally adorned with sculpture, representing either the gods to whom they were erected, or their symbols. See the PAGAN ALTARS represented on Plate XVII. Upon the sides of fig. 1, a trident and two dolphins are exhibited, which denote it to have been dedicated to Neptune. Fig. 2, a four-square altar, was dedicated to the Nymphs, as the inscription imports. Fig. 3, exhibits a Bacchanal holding a thyrsus in his hand, a mark of the altar's being built to Bacchus: it had two other sides, which made it appear triangular. Of fig. 4, which was also triangular, each face or side exhibited a genius, one of whom (on the side represented) carries an ear upon his neck, which seems to denote it an altar of Neptune. Fig. 5, an altar of a round shape, is inscribed Ara Neptuni: the god himself is there represented, all naked, having the pallium upon his shoulder; and holding in his left hand a trident, and in his right a dolphin.\n\nThe height of altars also differed according to the different gods to whom they sacrificed. According to Servius, those altars set apart for the honour of the celestial gods, and gods of the higher clasps, were placed on some pretty tall pile of building; and for that reason were called altaria, from the words alia and ara, \"a high elevated altar.\" Those appointed for the terrestrial gods were laid on the surface of the earth, and called arae. And, on the contrary, they dug into the earth and opened a pit for those of the infernal gods, which they called ἀνακάλυψις, ἀνακάλυψις. But this distinction is not everywhere observed: the best authors frequently use ara as a general word, under which are included the altars of the celestial and infernal, as well as those of the terrestrial gods. Witness Virgil, Eccl. 5.\n\nEn quatuor aras,\n\nwhere arae plainly includes altaria; for whatever we make of Daphnis, Phoebus was certainly a celestial god. So Cicero, pro Quint. Aras delubraque Hecate in Graecia vidimus. The Greeks also distinguished two sorts of altars; that whereon they sacrificed to the gods was called βωμός, and was a real altar, different from the other whereon they sacrificed to the heroes, which was smaller, and called εὐχεία. Pollux makes this distinction of altars in his Onomasticum; he adds, however, that some poets used the word εὐχεία for the altar whereon sacrifice was offered to the gods. The Septuagint version does sometimes also use the word εὐχεία for a sort of little low altar, which may be expressed in Latin by craticula; being a hearth rather than an altar.\n\nBefore temples were in use, altars were erected sometimes in groves, sometimes in the highways, and sometimes on the tops of mountains; and it was a custom to engrave upon them the name, ensign, or character of the deity to whom they were consecrated.\n\nIn the great temples of ancient Rome there were ordinarily three altars: The first was placed in the sanctuary, at the foot of the statue of the divinity, upon which incense was burnt and libations offered; the second was before the gate of the temple, and upon it they sacrificed the victims; and the third was a portable altar, upon which were placed the offering and the sacred vessels.\n\nBesides\nBesides these uses of altars, the ancients swore upon them, and swore by them, in making alliances, confirming treaties of peace, and other solemn occasions. Altars also served as places of refuge to all those who fled to them, whatever crime they had committed.\n\nAltars are doubtless as ancient as sacrifices themselves; consequently their origin is not much later than that of the world, Gen. ch. iv. Some attribute their origin to the Egyptians; others to the Jews; others to the patriarchs before the flood. Some carry them as far back as Adam, whose altar is much spoken of by Jewish, and even Christian writers. Others are contented to make the patriarch Enoch the first who consecrated a public altar. Be this as it will, the earliest altars we find any express testimony of are those erected by Abraham.\n\nAltars, in the patriarchal times, were very rude. The altar which Jacob set up at Bethel was nothing but a stone, which served him instead of a bolster; that of Gideon, a stone before his house; and the first which God commanded Moses to erect was probably of earth or unpolished stones, without any iron; for if any use was made of that metal, the altar was declared impure. The principal altars of the Jews were, The altar of incense; that of burnt-offering; and the altar, or table, for the shew-bread.\n\nThe altar of incense was a small table of shittim wood, covered with plates of gold, of one cubit in length, another in width, and two in height. At the four corners were four kinds of horns, and all round a little border or crown over it. This was the altar hidden by Jeremiah before the captivity; and upon it the officiating priest offered, every morning and evening, incense of a particular composition. See Plate XVII.\n\nThe altar of burnt-offerings was made of shittim wood, and carried upon the shoulders of the priests by slaves of the same wood overlaid with bras. In the time of Moses, this altar was five cubits square and three high; but in Solomon's temple it was much larger, being twenty cubits square and ten in height. It was covered with bras; and at each corner was a horn or spire, wrought out of the same wood with the altar, to which the sacrifices were tied. Within the hollow was a grate of bras, on which the fire was made; through it fell the ashes, which were received in a pan below. At the four corners of the grate were four rings and four chains, which kept it up at the horns. This altar was placed in the open air, that the smoke of the burnt-offerings might not fully the inside of the tabernacle. See Plate XVII.\n\nThe altar or table for the shew-bread was likewise of shittim wood, covered with plates of gold, having a little border round it, adorned with sculpture. It was two cubits long, one wide, and one and a half in height. Upon this table, which stood in the holy of holies, were put, every Sabbath day, twelve loaves, with salt and incense.\n\nThe Jewish altars, after their return from the captivity, and the building of the second temple, were in some respects different from those described above. That of burnt offerings was a large pile, built of unhewn stone, thirty cubits square at the bottom, and twenty-four square at the top. The ascent was by a gentle rising, thirty-two cubits in length, and sixteen in breadth.\n\nAltar, is also used among Christians for the communion-table.\n\nIn the primitive church, the altars were only of wood; as being frequently to be removed from place to place. But the council of Paris, in 509, decreed that no altar should be built but of stone. At first there was but one altar in each church; but the number soon increased; and from the writings of Gregory the Great, who lived in the fifth century, we learn, that there were sometimes in the same church twelve or thirteen. In the cathedral of Magdeburg there are no less than forty-nine altars.\n\nThe altar is sometimes sustained on a single column, as in the subterranean chapels of St Cecilia, at Rome, &c.; and sometimes by four columns, as the altar of St Sebastian of Crypta Arenaria; but the customary form is, to be a massive of stone work, sustaining the altar table. These altars bear a resemblance to tombs; to this purpose, we read in church-history, that the primitive Christians chiefly held their meetings at the tombs of the martyrs, and celebrated the mysteries of religion upon them: for which reason, it is a standing rule to this day in the church of Rome, never to build an altar, without including the relics of some saint in it.\n\nALTAR-THANE, or ALTARIST, in old Law-books, an appellation given to the priest or parson of a parish, to whom the altarage belonged. See ALTARAGE.\n\nALTARAGE, in Law, altars erected in virtue of donations, before the Reformation, within a parochial church, for the purpose of singing of mass for deceased friends.\n\nALTARAGE likewise signifies the profits arising to the priest on account of the altar.\n\nAL-TAYEFF, a town of Hejaz, a district of Arabia Felix.

This is also called permutation, &c., and is easily found by a continual multiplication of all the numbers, beginning at unity.

His father was minister of the church of Embden, and early destined his son to the same profession. In the year 1602, after a grammatical course he was sent to the university of Herborn: there he studied with so much assiduity and success, that he soon had the honour of being a preceptor. Qualified by the vigorous exertions of his talents, he was appointed tutor to the three young counts of Nassau, Solms, and Hessenberg, who studied with the elector prince palatine, first at Sedan, and afterwards at Heidelberg. A proper discharge of the duties of a lower station generally paves the way for a higher. For he was appointed preceptor to the prince in 1608: and in consequence of his assiduity and success, he was chosen to accompany the elector into England. Among the number of celebrated men to whose acquaintance he was introduced in England, was the famous Dr Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1613, Alting returning to Heidelberg after the marriage of the elector with the princess of England, received his degree of doctor of divinity, and was appointed director of the college of Wisdom. The increased knowledge and invigorated talents of Alting, were always receiving renewed opportunities of exertion; thus his eloquence\nquence and learning obtained full scope in the synod of Dort, to which he had been deputed by the Palatinate, along with two other divines.\n\nIt was but reasonable for Alting to expect high prettiment and high advantages from the avowed patronage of the elector; but in this he was greatly disappointed, and he had only to participate in his misfortunes. In 1622, Count Tilly took the city of Heidelberg, and devoted it to plunder. In order to escape the fury of the soldiers, Alting endeavoured to pass by a back door into the chancellor's house, which was put under a strong guard; but the officer who guarded the house, as he was entering said to him, \"With this battle-axe I have today killed ten men, and Alting, if I knew where to find him, should be the eleventh: who are you?\" Alting with a singular presence of mind returned an evasive answer, which saved his life. \"I am (said he) a teacher in the college of Wismar.\" The officer took him under his protection, but the Jesuits unfortunately taking possession of the house, the next day, left the generous officer no time at his departure to take care of the teacher of the college of Wismar. Alting evaded the hands of the Jesuits, by hiding himself in a garret, and a cook of the electoral court supplied him with food, who happened to be employed by Count Tilly in the kitchen occupied by him in the chancellor's house. In this perilous situation he remained until an opportunity offered of making his escape to Heilbronn, whither his family had been conducted before.\n\nBut ecclesiastical intolerance harassed Alting, as much as he was formerly endangered by military hostility. With the permission of the duke of Wirtemberg he retired for a few months to Schorndorf after the defection of the Palatinate by the victorious forces of Count Tilly. It was reasonable to expect that a welcome and hospitable reception might have been given, among Protestants, to one who had just escaped the flames of a Popish war. But the doctrine of mutual forbearance and candour seems to have been little attended to by the Protestants at this period, whatever was their progress in the knowledge of the other doctrines of Christianity. The palatinate being in the vicinity of the duchy of Wirtemberg, the professors of Tubingen and Heidelberg frequently attacked each other in polemic writings and theological disputations. The natural consequence was, that a settled jealousy and enmity existed between the two schools and their respective vicinities. The injuries which Alting had suffered from the common enemy were not sufficient to secure him a friendly reception among the Lutheran ministers of Schorndorf, who were involved in these feuds, and therefore murmured at the permission which the duke had given to a professor of Heidelberg to reside there. The mischievous effects of religious divisions have been universally felt.\n\nIn 1623, Alting retired with his family to Embrden, and afterwards followed to the Hague his late pupil, now king of Bohemia. Such was the unfeigned attachment of his master to him, that he still retained him as a preceptor to his eldest son; and prevented him from accepting the charge of the church at Embrden, and likewise of a professorship at the university of Franeker. In 1627 his importance prevailed upon his patron, and he obtained leave to remove to Groningen, and there ascended the divinity chair; and continued to lecture with increasing reputation until the day of his death. The ardent desire and repeated endeavours of several universities to appropriate to themselves the honour and benefit of his services, is the most unequivocal proof of the general esteem in which his character was held. The states of Groningen positively refused to give their consent to his removal, when the university of Leyden solicited him to come and labour among them. But some time after, the prospect of extensive usefulness in re-establishing the university of Heidelberg, and restoring the churches of the Palatinate, determined him to accept the office of professor of divinity and ecclesiastical senator, presented to him by Prince Lewis Philip. In the year 1634, amidst numerous hardships, to which the existing war exposed him, he set out for Heidelberg, and pursued his journey as far as Frankfort; when the battle of Nördlingen, in which the imperialists were victorious, rendered his farther progress impracticable, and therefore with great difficulty he returned to Groningen.\n\nDomestic affection and personal sufferings embittered the remaining years of this excellent man's life. Deprived of his eldest daughter by death, such was his great affection for her that it brought on a settled melancholy, attended with a bodily disease which was with great difficulty removed; but after an interval of four years a settled and irrecoverable melancholy seized him, in consequence of the loss of an amiable and beloved wife, which, together with the return of his bodily disease, in a few months put a period to his useful life in the year 1644.\n\nAlting was a man of eminent talents and extensive learning, possessed of amiable dispositions, which induced him to be more solicitous to serve the public than to benefit himself. The amiable character and extensive learning of Alting, cannot fail deeply to interest every reader, in consequence of his misfortunes. He was adverse to quarrels and disputes about trifles, although no friend to the innovations introduced at this period by the Socinians. According to his own judgment, adhering to the plain doctrine of Scripture, he was equally desirous to avoid fanatical scrupulosity and sophistical subtlety. The productions of his pen are: *Notes in Decadum Problematum, Johannis Beom, Heidelbergae, 1618*; *Notes on a Decad of Jacob Behmen's Problems.* Loci Communes; *Common places.* Problema; *Problems.* Explicatio Catachese Palaatinat.; *Explanation of the Palatine Catechism.* Exegetis Augustana Confessionis, &c., Amst. 1647; *Commentary on the Augsburg Confession.* Methodus Theologiae Didactica et Catachetica, Amst. 1650; *A method of Didactic and Catechetical Theology.* The Medulla Historiae Prophezea, *Marrow of Profane History,* published under the name of Pareus, was written by Alting. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAlting, James, son of Henry Alting, was born at Heidelberg in 1618. After the usual course of grammatical studies he became a student, and soon after professor of divinity in the university of Groningen. The Oriental languages were his favourite studies at an early period of his life; and in 1638 he put himself under the tuition of a Jewish rabbi at Embrden. Determining to take up his residence in England, he arrived there in 1640, and was admitted to clerical orders by Doctor Prideaux bishop of Worcester. By\nAltig, an offer of the Hebrew professorship in the university of Groningen, he was soon induced to alter his plan of life, and consequently again returned to Germany in 1643. His active affability in these languages, and his knowledge in other sciences, procured him universal esteem, and great reputation as a scholar. About this time he received many academic honours; he was admitted doctor of philosophy, academic preacher, and at last, in conjunction with a colleague, Samuel des Marets, was chosen professor of divinity. These professors followed different methods of teaching, and adopted different systems. Des Marets was an admirer and follower of the subtleties of the scholastics; and by the ingenuity with which he purified the scholastic plan of instruction had acquired great reputation and considerable influence. Altig spent his time in the study of the Scriptures, and in the pursuit of Rabbinical learning; and he delivered a course of lectures on divinity, which gained him great popularity. As it might naturally be expected, a mutual jealousy arose between the two professors; and their respective partisans in the university carried their animosity to an undue height. Established opinion, and the weight of authority, marshalled on the side of Des Marets. By the permission of the curators of the university he appeared as public accuser of Altig, and produced a long list of erroneous propositions to the divines of Leyden for their opinion. The judgment of the divines upon the dilute shows a great degree of moderation and good sense: they pronounced Altig innocent of heresy, but imprudently fond of innovation; and they declared Des Marets deficient in modesty and candour. If the superiors had not prohibited the farther discussion of these subjects in the confectories, classes, and synods, they would have occasioned as much mischief as they had excited general attention. Such was the protection given to Altig, that whenever any of the order of ecclesiastics proposed any further measures against him, they were immediately rejected by the civil power; nay, the penalty of deprivation was decreed against those clergy who should revive the Marso-Altigian controversy. Whatever might be the advantages resulting to Altig from this protection, the magistrates certainly did wrong in proceeding so far in prohibiting a free discussion from the prelfs, either for or against the judgments of the divines of Leyden. Although a kind of reconciliation was attempted by their common friends while Des Marets lay upon his death-bed, yet the breach between Des Marets and Altig was never perfectly healed. Dr Altig died of a fever in 1679. The fondness which he showed for Rabbinical learning gave birth to the general report, that he was inclined to become a Jew. His opinions which seem to have excited more general attention than they deserve, may be seen at large in his writings, which were collected a few years after his death, and published in five volumes folio by his cousin Menlo Altig, who wrote a good description of the Low Countries, under the title of Notitia Germaniae Inferioris.

See Geometry.\n\nThe method of taking considerable terrestrial altitudes, of which those of mountains are the greatest, by means of the barometer, is very easy and expeditious.

If it be taken from the rational or real horizon, the altitude is said to be true or real; if from the apparent or sensible horizon, the altitude is apparent. Or rather, the apparent altitude is such as it appears to our observation; and the true is that from which the refraction has been subtracted.\n\nThe true altitudes of the sun, fixed stars, and planets, differ but very little from their apparent altitudes; because of their great distance from the centre of the earth, and the smallness of the earth's semidiameter, when compared thereto. But the difference between the true and apparent altitude of the moon is about 52.

His grandfather, Frederick de Toledo, was his preceptor in the military and political arts, and he displayed his valour at the battle of Pavia and at the siege of Tunis. The ambitious Charles V. selected Alva as a proper instrument for conducting his military enterprises, and he made him his general in 1538; and, after several operations, in which he both displayed his valour and military knowledge, in 1542 he successfully defended Perpignan against the dauphin of France.\n\nIn 1546, Alva was made general in chief of the army which marched against the German Protestants, who were marshalled under the banners of the elector of Saxony. Francis, the king of France, died at Rambouillet, and by his death a considerable change was made in the state of Europe. Instantly, therefore, Charles began his march from Egra on the borders of Bohemia, and entered the southern frontier of Saxony, and attacked Altorf upon the Elster. Incessantly pushing forward, he arrived the evening of the 23rd of April on the banks of the Elbe, opposite to Mühlberg. The river, at that place, was three hundred paces in breadth, about four feet in depth; its current rapid; and the bank possessed by the Saxons was higher than that which he occupied. In opposition to the opinion of the duke of Alva and his other officers, Charles, with undaunted courage, and with inexplicable difficulties, led his army through the river, and engaged the Saxons. The elector displayed great personal courage and military knowledge, but having received a wound in the face, he at last surrendered himself prisoner. When he approached the emperor, he said, \"The fortune of war has made me your prisoner, most gracious emperor, and I hope to be treated.\"\n\nHere Charles hardly interrupted him, \"And am I then at last acknowledged to be emperor? Charles of Ghent was the only title you lately allowed me. You shall be treated as you deserve.\" The elector made no reply; but, with an unaltered countenance, which discovered neither astonishment nor dejection, accompanied the Spanish soldiers appointed to guard him. The emperor proceeded towards Wittemberg, whither the remains of the Saxon army had fled, carrying along with him the captive prince, as a spectacle of consternation and amazement to his own subjects. But when he approached the town, he found it defended by the vigorous efforts of the elector's wife, along with the inhabitants. He summoned Sibylla once and a second time to open the gates, informing her, that if she persisted in her obstinacy, the elector should answer for it with his head. Accordingly he brought his prisoner to an immediate trial. The proceedings against him were as irregular as the stratagem was barbarous. Instead of consulting the states of the empire, or remitting the cause to any court, which, according to the German constitution, might have legally taken cognizance of the elector's crime, he subjected the greatest prince in the empire to the jurisdiction of a court martial. The emperor selected the unrelenting duke of Alva as a proper instrument to carry into effect any measure of violence and oppression, and therefore made him president of that court, composed of Spanish and Italian officers. Moved more by the entreaties of his wife than by a sense of his own danger, the elector submitted to all the rigorous and unjust measures that were proposed in order to save his life; but when it was added, that he should also renounce the Protestant faith and become a Roman Catholic, he refused to act in opposition to his conscience, and bravely fell a sacrifice to the cause of truth.\n\nIn 1552, Alva was intrusted with the command of the army intended to invade France, and was constrained by the opinion and authority of the emperor to lay siege to Mentz, in opposition to his own military knowledge; but notwithstanding all his valour and abilities, the duke of Guise successfully defended the place. In consequence of the success of the French arms in Piedmont, he was made commander in chief of all the emperor's forces in Italy, and at the same time invested with unlimited power. Success did not, however, attend his first attempts, and after several unfortunate attacks, he was obliged to retire into winter quarters. The next year he was sent into the pope's territories, and, had he not been restrained by his master, he would have taken possession of all his fortified places, and deterred Henry from entering into any new connexion with him, and have thereby prevented the renewal of the war. Philip was strongly inclined to peace, but Alva was inclined to severe measures: he however yielded to the instructions of his master, until being deluded, and sometimes haughtily answered, he at length sent Pino de Loffredo with a letter to the college of cardinals, and another to Paul, in which, after enumerating the various injuries which his master had received, and renewing his former offers of peace and friendship, he concluded with protesting that, if his offers were again rejected, the pope should be chargeable with all the calamities that might follow. The pope threw Loffredo into prison; and, had not the college of cardinals interfered, he would have even put him to death; and on account of Philip's failing to pay tribute for Naples, he deprived him of the sovereignty of that kingdom. This violent conduct of Paul gave great offence throughout all Europe, and greatly lessened his influence in Italy; but Philip, though a young, ambitious, powerful monarch, and of a temper of mind impatient of injuries and affronts, moved\nmoved with a religious veneration, discovered an amazing reluctance against proceeding to extremities. After much time spent in negotiation, Philip was at last forced to give orders for Alva to take the field. He cheerfully obeyed, and began his march in the beginning of September 1556, with a well disciplined army, which reducing several towns in the Campagna di Roma, he pursued his conquests to the very gates of Rome. The circumstances, however, in which Alva found his army, induced him to make a truce of 40 days, and, after several negotiations, he yielded to peace. One of its terms was, that the duke of Alva should in person ask forgiveness of the haughty pontiff whom he had conquered. Proud as the duke was by nature, and accustomed to treat with persons of the highest dignity, yet such was the superstitious veneration then entertained for the papal character, that he confessed his voice failed him at the interview, and his presence of mind forbore him. Not long after this, he was sent at the head of a splendid embassy to Paris, to espouse, in the name of his master, Elizabeth, daughter of Henry king of France.\n\nPhilip II., his new master, being strongly devoted to the Roman see, and determined to reclaim rebels to his government, and dissenters from his faith, by the most unrelenting severity and unbounded cruelty, he pitched upon Alva as the fittest person to carry this system into practice; with this design, therefore, he was sent into the Low Countries in 1567. Having received his orders, armed with such power as left only the shadow of authority to the natural governor, and provided with 10,000 veterans, he marched towards that devoted country. When he arrived, he soon shewed how much he merited the confidence which his matter repose in him, and instantly erected a bloody tribunal, to try all persons who had been engaged in the late commotions which the civil and the religious tyranny of Philip had excited. The depraved enormities of the mind of Alva raged with unexampled violence. He imprisoned the counts Egmont and Horn, the two popular leaders of the Protestants, and soon brought them to an unjust trial, and condemned them to death. In a little time he totally annihilated every privilege of the people, and with uncontrolled fury and cruelty, put multitudes of them to death. Beholding herself deprived of all authority, and her subjects devoted to destruction, the duchess of Parma resigned her office, disdaining to hold the nominal, while the actual reins of power were in the hands of Alva. This event increased the general tide of wretchedness, and every place was filled with scenes of horror and dismay. Unable for the present to administer the least aid, the prince of Orange saved his life by flight. This noble prince suddenly collected an army in Germany, and returned to the relief of his countrymen; and at the same time Prince Lewis, his brother, marched with an army into Friesland. Although success at first attended Lewis, yet the activity and experience of Alva prevailed, and he was totally defeated. The prince of Orange proved a more formidable foe; and it gave exertion to the united talents of Alva, and his son Frederick of Toledo, to prevent the prince from making a descent upon the Netherlands. But notwithstanding all the address and military skill of the prince of Orange, this was effected; and the glory remained to Alva to baffle that great leader, and to compel him, after great loss of men, to disband the remainder of his army. Now the cruelty of Alva had unrestrained vent. Instantly the executioner was employed in removing all those friends of freedom whom the sword had spared. Uncontrolled, the base and unrelenting heart of Alva began to reduce all the provinces to utter slavery, and to extirpate Protestantism in that country. In most of the considerable towns, Alva built citadels. He erected a statue of himself, which was no less a monument of his vanity than his tyranny, in the city of Antwerp: he was figured trampling on the necks of two smaller statues, representing the two estates of the Low Countries. By his unusual and arbitrary requisition of new supplies from the states, he greatly aggravated this haughty insult. The human mind displays unusual vigour when rendered desperate by oppression. The exiles from the Low Countries, roused to action, fitted out a kind of piratical fleet, and, after strengthening themselves by successful depredations, ventured upon the bold exploit of seizing the town of Brielle. Thus, unattended by him, the cruelty of Alva was the instrument of the future independence of the seven Dutch provinces. The fleet of the exiles having met the Spanish fleet, totally defeated it, and reduced North Holland and Mons; and numbers of cities hastened to throw off the yoke; while the states-general assembling at Dordrecht, openly declared against Alva's government, and marshalled under the banners of the prince of Orange. This situation of affairs opened the eyes of Alva to behold the instability of a power founded on terror and oppression; he therefore began in vain to use more lenient measures. He prepared, however, with vigour to oppose the gathering storm, and afterwards recovered Mons, Mechlin, and Zutphen, under the conduct of his son Frederick, where his soldiers more than retaliated upon the prince of Orange. With the exception of Zealand and Holland, he regained all the provinces; and at last his son stormed Woerden, and, massacring its inhabitants with the most savage cruelty, he then proceeded to invest the city of Haarlem. Fully convinced of the miseries that waited their surrender, this city stood an obstinate siege; and nothing less than the inflexible and persevering spirit of Alva could have opposed difficulties almost insurmountable. Dispairing of success, Frederick was at one time disposed to raise the siege, but the stern reproaches of his father urged him on; and at length the inhabitants, overcome with fatigue and resistance, surrendered. The victorious Frederick gave tolerable conditions to the town; but his cruel father arriving on the third day after the surrender, sacrificed numerous victims, who had been led to expect mercy, and satiated his vengeance to the full. Their next attack was upon Alkmaar; but the spirit of desperate resistance was raised to such a height in the breasts of the Hollanders, that the Spanish veterans were repulsed with great loss, and Frederick constrained reluctantly to retire. Alva now resolved to try his fortune by sea, and with great labour and expense fitted out a powerful fleet, and proceeded to attack the Zeelanders, but was entirely defeated, and the commander taken prisoner. About the same period, the prince of Orange proceeded to attack the town of Gertruydenburg. Alva's feeble state\nstate of health and continued disasters induced him to solicit his recall from the government of the Low Countries; a measure which, in all probability, was not displeasing to Philip, who was now resolved to make trial of a milder administration. In December 1573, that devoted country was freed from the presence and oppressions of the duke of Alva, who, accompanied by his son, returning home, gave out the inglorious boast, that he had, during the course of six years, besides the multitudes destroyed in battle and massacred after victory, configned 18,000 persons to the executioner. Requiem, who succeeded him in the command, in his first act of administration, pulled down his insolent effigies at Antwerp, so that nothing might remain of him in that much injured country but the remembrance of his injustice and cruelty.\n\nReturning from this scene of oppression and blood, he was treated for some time with great distinction by his master. Justice, however, soon overtook the crimes of Alva: for his son having debauched one of the king's attendants, under promise of marriage, he was committed to prison; and being aided in his escape by his father, and married by him to a cousin of his own, this procured Alva's banishment from court, and confinement in the castle of Uzeda. He remained two years in this disgraceful situation, until the success of Don Antonio, in assuring the crown of Portugal, determined Philip to turn his eyes towards a person, in whose fidelity and abilities he could on this occasion most confide. A secretary was instantly despatched to Alva, to make inquiries concerning the state of his health, and whether or not it was sufficiently vigorous to undertake the command of an army. The aged chief returned an answer full of loyal zeal, and was immediately appointed to the supreme command in Portugal. It is a singular fact, however, that the enlargement and elevation of Alva was not followed by forgiveness. It is a characteristic mark of the unrelenting temper of Philip, and, at the same time, a noble testimony to the honour and loyalty of Alva, that although placed in this important trust, he did not procure his pardon. In 1581, Alva entered Portugal, defeated Antonio, drove him from the kingdom, and soon reduced the whole under the subjection of Philip. Entering Lisbon, he seized an immense treasure; and with their accumulated violence and rapacity, he suffered his soldiers to sack the suburbs and vicinity. It is reported, that Alva being requested to give an account of the money expended on that occasion, he sternly replied, \"If the king asks me for an account, I will make him a statement of kingdoms preferred or conquered, of signal victories, of successful sieges, and of sixty years service.\" Philip deemed it proper to make no farther inquiries. Alva, however, did not enjoy the honours and rewards of his last expedition, for in 1582, at the age of 74, he was removed by death to the impartial tribunal of heaven, to receive the just rewards of his iniquitous life.\n\nThe actions already enumerated give such an ample idea of his character, that little more is necessary to complete it. In him a variety of extremes concentrated. Some of the best qualities of a commander were blended with some of the worst that ever existed in a man or in a general. The Spanish severity, little tempered by the spirit of generosity, appeared in all its horrible deformity in Alva. A strict impartial discipline was his greatest military virtue, and vanity was his greatest weakness. In consequence of this strict discipline, he sometimes punished the unlicensed barbarities of his soldiers; and there is an instance recorded, that when his favourite son Frederick, thinking he could attack the prince of Orange with advantage, sent a request to his father for permission, he received a stern reprimand, for presuming to exercise his judgment on a point already determined by his superior, with a threatening in case of repetition. (Gen. Bage.)\n\nALVAH, the wood wherewith Moses sweetened the waters of Marah, Exod. ch. xv. ver. 25.—The name of this wood is not found in Scripture; but the Mahometans give it that of akab, and pretend to trace its history from the patriarchs before the flood. Josephus on the contrary, says, that Moses used the wood which he found next lying before him.\n\nALVARES DE LUNA, treasurer, and a great favourite of John II. king of Castile, was famous for the prodigious ascendancy he gained over this prince, and for the punishment which at length overtook him. He was a natural son of Don Alvaro de Luna, lord of Canete in Arragon, and of a woman of infamous character. He was born in 1388, and named Peter; but Pope Benedict XIII., who was charmed with his wit though yet a child, changed Peter to Alvares. He was introduced to court in 1408, and made a gentleman of the bedchamber to King John, with whom he grew into the highest favour. In 1427 he was obliged to retire: the courtiers exerted all their endeavours to ruin him: they complained, that a man of no military skill, of no virtues whatever, should by mere artifice and dissimulation, be advanced to the highest authority; and they could not bear, that by the affluence of a few upstart men, whom he had raised and fixed to his interest, he should reign as absolutely as if he were king.\n\nThey prevailed against him, and Alvares was banished from court a year and a half: but this was the greatest affliction imaginable to the king; who showed all marks of distress the moment he was removed from his presence, and now thought and spoke of nothing but Alvares. He was therefore recalled; and, being invested with his usual authority, revenged himself severely upon his enemies, by persuading the king to banish them. Of the 45 years he spent at court, he enjoyed for 30 of them to entire an ascendancy over the king, that nothing could be done without his express orders: nay, it is related by Mariana, that the king could not change an officer or servant, or even his clothes or diet, without the approbation of Alvares. In short he wanted nothing to complete his grandeur but the name of king: he had all the places in the kingdom at his disposal; he was master of the treasury, and by bounties had so gained the hearts of the subjects, that the king, though his eyes were now opened, and his affections sufficiently turned against him, durst not complain.\n\nBut the day of reckoning was approaching, and at length he was seized; yet not directly, openly, and violently, but with some of that management which upon a similar occasion was formerly employed by Tiberius against Sejanus. During his confinement, he made several\nAlvares, several attempts to speak to the king in person; but not being able to effect this, he sent the following letter, from which, as well as from the rest of Alvarez's history, all court favourites may draw abundant matter for edification and instruction. \"Sir, it is five and forty years since I was admitted into your service. I do not complain of the rewards I have received: they were greater than my merits or expectation, as I shall not deny. There was but one thing wanting to complete my happiness; and that was, to have fixed proper limits in time to this great fortune of mine. While, instead of choosing retirement, after the example of the greatest men, I still continued in the employment, which I thought not only my duty, but necessary for your interest, I fell into this misfortune. It is very hard that I should be deprived of liberty, when I have risked life and fortune more than once to restore it to you. Grief prevents me from laying more. I know that the Deity is provoked against me by my fins; but it will be sufficient for me, if his anger is appeased by the calamities I now suffer. I can no longer bear that prodigious mass of riches, which it was wrong in me to have heaped together. I should willingly resign them, but that every thing I have is in your power; and I am denied the opportunity of showing mankind, that you have raised a person to the height of greatness, who can contain wealth as well as procure it, and give it back to him from whom he received it. But I desire you in the strongest terms, that, as I was obliged, by the laws of the treasury, to raise 10,000 or 12,000 crowns by methods I ought not to have taken, you will restore them to the persons from whom they were extorted. If you will not grant this on account of the services I have done, yet I think it necessary to be done from the reason of the thing.\"\n\nThis letter, however, produced no effect in his favour: Alvares was tried, and condemned to lose his head. After condemnation, he was removed to Valladolid; and having confessed himself, and received the sacrament, he was carried upon a mule to the market-place, in the middle of which a large scaffold was erected. Mounting the scaffold, he paid reverence to the cross, and presently gave his hat and signet to his page, saying, \"These are the last gifts you will ever receive from me.\" He then submitted himself to the axe with the utmost intrepidity.\n\nALVAREZ, Francis, a Portuguese priest, and almoner to Emanuel, king of Portugal, flourished about the beginning of the 16th century. He was sent ambassador from Portugal to David prince of Abyssinia; and after a residence of six years in that country, returned with letters of friendship from David to Juan, who had succeeded Emanuel, and of submission to Pope Clement VII. At Bologna, in the year 1523, he gave a narrative of his expedition to the pope, in the presence of the emperor Charles V. In the year 1540, he published the relation of his journey in one volume folio, in the Portuguese language. He gives a plain and accurate description of this empire; and we are indebted to him for the first of the kind that ever published. This work was translated into Latin, under the title of De Fide, Regione, Moribus Ethiopum, by Damien Goez, a Portuguese gentleman; and it has often been reprinted and translated into other languages. The information of Alvares is not, however, to be received with implicit credit, because he does not always speak from his own observation, and he frequently exaggerates. (Dict. Hist.)\n\nALUDELS, in the older and more complicated chemical apparatus, were earthen pots without bottoms, inserted into each other, and used in sublimations.\n\nALVEARIUM, in Anatomy, the bottom of the concha, or hollow of the outer ear.\n\nALVEARIUM also signifies a bee-hive. The word is formed of alveus, \"a channel or cavity;\" in allusion to the alveoli or cells in bee-hives.\n\nSome of the ancients use also the word alvearium for a bee-house, more usually called among us apiary.\n\nALVEARIUM is sometimes also used figuratively, to denote a collection; in which sense, alvearium amounts to much the same with what we otherwise called the faurus, cornucopia, or the like. Vinc. Boreus has published an alvearium of law.\n\nALVEOLUS, in Natural History, the name of the waxen cells in bee-hives. Also the name of a sea shell of a conic figure, composed of a number of cells like bee-hives, joined into each other with a pipe of communication.\n\nALVEOLUS, in Anatomy, the sockets in the jaws wherein the teeth are fixed. Some writers speak of teeth growing without alveoli. Pliny mentions a person who had a tooth in his palate. Eustachius relates, that he saw a man who at 60 had a tooth growing out of the middle of his fauces. Holler gives an instance of a person whose teeth were of a piece with his jaws, without any insertion into alveoli.\n\nALVIANO, Bartholomew, a Venetian general, flourished in the beginning of the 16th century. His talents were well calculated for the conduct of military affairs, and in an early part of his life, raised him to great reputation. In the year 1508, he gained such signal victories over the emperor Maximilian, that he was decreed triumphal honours by the republic. During the famous league of Venice, he was second in command along with Count Pritigliano. It was, however, unfavourable to the cause in which they had engaged, that the tempers of the two commanders were very different. The commander in chief was hesitating and cautious; the other was bold and intrepid. Alviano commanded the rear-guard at the famous battle of Aignadel, and after displaying the greatest exertions of valour, was wounded, overpowered, and at last taken prisoner. An increasing tribute was paid to the military talents of Alviano; for after the Venetians had become the allies of France, he was intrusted with the command of their army. When the emperor attacked Padua, he defended it against him, and displayed numerous acts of valour in repelling the imperial troops. But the current of human life runs unequally smooth on its attendance upon any character; for he lost the great battle of La Motte, in which, however, his exertions were so conspicuous, that the senate gave him the most honourable assurance of the continuance of their esteem. Fortune, however, soon became propitious to this great man, and he defeated the enemy in Friuli. In the desperate battle of Marignano, he afforded such timely aid to Francis I. that it greatly contributed to his success. But the most vigorous\ngorous constitution must one day yield to the force of constant exertions, and the most incessant fatigue; he had incurred such hardships in superintending the works at the siege of Brescia, that he was seized with a fever, of which he died at the advanced age of sixty. His character stands high in the annals of military fame. By strict observance of discipline, and a profuse liberality to his soldiers, he secured their esteem. As an unequivocal proof of this, they kept his body unburied twenty-five days, carrying it about with them during their marches, with all funeral pomp. His loss was deeply regretted by the state, and, as a proof thereof, his body was buried at the public charge, his unprovided family was supported by a liberal pension, and his daughters were portioned by the state. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nALUM, in Chemistry, a clear and transparent saline matter, usually sold in large masses, of a very austere and astringent taste, useful in medicine and in various arts.\n\nMost of the alum to be met with is artificially prepared by the methods related in their proper place under the article Chemistry, or by others similar to them: though sometimes a small quantity is produced naturally. This native alum is mixed with heterogeneous matters, or effloresces in various forms upon the ores during calcination. It rarely occurs in a crystallized state, though thus it is said to be met with in Egypt, Sardinia, Spain, Bohemia, and other places. It is also found in waters impregnated with fixed air, but very seldom in fountains or hot medicated waters.\n\nThere are several kinds of alum to be met with; but these differ from one another only in being mixed with some salts which are not of the aluminous kinds. That called the Roman alum has been considered as preferable to any other. This is usually met with in small crystals, and has a reddish colour, most probably owing to a small quantity of calx of iron, which, however, does not in the least impair its qualities. The other kinds of alum contain a portion either of vitriolated tartar or sal ammoniac, according to the nature of the alkali used in its preparation. Mr Bergman informs us, that the vegetable alkali, if pure, does not hurt the alum, though it be added in the preparation; but that the volatile alkali, by adulterating it with a portion of vitriolic sal ammoniac, renders it unfit for some purposes. The alum, made by adding a portion of clay to the liquor at the beginning of the boiling, he considers as equal, if not superior, to Roman alum. He informs us also, that a kind of alum some time ago began to be manufactured at Brunswick, which was equal in quality to the Roman alum. On a chemical analysis of this alum he found it mixed with cobalt.\n\nThis salt is extremely useful in the art of dyeing; as by means of it a great number of colours are fixed and rendered permanent upon cloth, which otherwise would either not adhere in any degree, or only for a very short time. In what manner this is accomplished, we are very much ignorant; the conjectures and theories on this subject are related under the article Dying. It constitutes the basis of crayons, which generally consist of the earth of alum finely powdered and tinged for the purpose. In the preparation of Prussian blue, it prevents the basis of martial vitriol, which is soluble in acids, from being precipitated by the superfluous alkali employed in the preparation of that pigment; that is, the alkali which is not saturated by the colouring matter. As this basis adheres more strongly than the clay to the vitriolic acid, and would form a green by the mixture of its yellowness, the white earth of alum likewise according to its quantity, dilutes the darker colours, even black itself, and produces an infinite number of shades. It is also of use in the making of candles: for being mixed with the tallow, it gives it a hardness and consistence which it has not naturally. Wood sufficiently soaked in a solution of alum does not easily take fire; and the same is true of paper impregnated with it; which, for that reason, is very properly employed in preserving gunpowder, as it also excludes the moisture of the air. Paper impregnated with alum is useful in whitening silver, and silvering brass without heat. Alum is also of use in tanning, where it assists in restoring the cohesion of the skins almost entirely destroyed by the lime. Vintners fine down their wines, &c., with alum; fishers use it to dry cod fish with; and bakers have mixed it with the flour to make their bread compact and white: to this last use of it great objections have been made; but unjustly, for it is entirely innocent. It is now seldom used.\n\nIn medicine it is of considerable use as an astringent and tonic. It is reckoned particularly serviceable for restraining hemorrhages, and immoderate secretions from the blood; but less proper in intestinal fluxes. In violent hemorrhages, it may be given in doses of 15 or 20 grains, and repeated every hour or half hour till the bleeding abates: in other cases, smaller doses are more advisable; large ones being apt to nauseate the stomach, and occasion violent constrictions of the bowels. It is used also externally, in astringent and repellent lotions and collyria. Burnt alum taken internally has been highly extolled in cases of colic. In such instances, when taken to the extent of a scruple for a dose, it has been said gently to move the belly, and give very great relief from the severe pain. Its officinal preparations are, for internal use, pulvis stypticus, and aqua styptica; for external applications, the aqua aluminis, and coagulum aluminis et alumen stypticum; which last is no other than the alum dried by fire, or freed from the watery moisture, which, like other salts, it always retains in its crystalline form. By this loss of its water it becomes sharper, so as to act as a slight escharotic; and it is chiefly with this intention that it is employed in medicine, being very rarely taken internally. For these preparations, see Pharmacy.\n\nAlum Mines are said to have been first found in Italy in the year 1460; and in 1506 King Henry VII. made a monopolizing grant of this commodity to Augustine Chigi, a merchant of Sienna. In the year 1608, the manufacture of alum was first invented, and successively practised in England, meeting with great encouragement in Yorkshire, where it was first made, from Lord Sheffield, and the other gentlemen of that county. King James I. by advice of his ministry, assumed the monopoly of it to himself, and therefore prohibited the importation of foreign alum; and in 1625 the importation of it was further prohibited by the proclamation of Charles I.\n\nAlum Works, places where alum is prepared, and manufactured in quantities for sale. They differ from\nAlypius, one of the seven Greek writers on music, which Meibomius has industriously collected and published, with a commentary and explanatory notes. The time in which he flourished cannot be precisely determined. He is said to have wrote before Euclid and Ptolemy; and Caffiodorus arranges his work, entitled \"Introduction to Music,\" between that of Nicomachus and Gaudensius. In this work is to be found the most complete nomenclature of all the sounds of the different scales and modes of the ancient Greek music, which have escaped the wreck of time. So complex was the science of music in Greece at this period, that the characters used for sounds were 1620 in number. The twenty-four letters of the alphabet furnished these notes, sometimes in an entire, sometimes in a mutilated, and sometimes in an altered form; and numerous discriminations of these took place by means of the accents and varied positions of letters.\n\nFrom the MS. of Joseph Scaliger, Meursius first published this tract in 1616; but according to the testimony of Fabricius, it is by no means correct. Extracts have been published from Alypius, by Kircher, in his Musurgia, 1650, alleging that he translated the whole into Latin; but this table of ancient musical notation is so inaccurate, which he has inferred from him, that Meibomius, who consulted not only the Greek MS. of Scaliger, but that of Belejanus, Barocci, Barberitti, and Selden, affirms, that he found in it more than 200 errors. The learned Meibomius, with incredible industry, deciphered those characters, which previous to his time were so much confounded, disfigured, and corrupted, either through the ignorance or inattention of the transcribers of ancient MSS. This advantage resulted to the science of music, chiefly by his commentaries on Greek musicians, and particularly on the works of Alypius.\n\nAlypius of Tagaste, a Christian divine who flourished in the fourth century. In the year 388, he was baptized along with Augustine, and, in consequence of a similarity of dispositions and religious sentiments, they became strongly attached to each other. In quest of information and improvement, he took a journey into Palestine; and returning home, he soon acquired such general esteem, that he was appointed bishop of his native city. He had adopted in the early part of his life the opinions of the Maniches; but in consequence of farther information and matured experience, he became a powerful advocate for the Catholic faith. The Donatists flourished about this period, and arrogantly claimed the exclusive honour of being the true church; but he, along with his friend Augustine, united his exertions in opposing the tenets of that sect. In the council of Carthage in the year 403, the erudition and talents of Alypius, along with several other eminent divines, were unsuccessfully employed in endeavouring to reclaim them, and to bring them again into the bosom of the church. In 411 Alypius was one of the seven who held a friendly and theological conference with seven of the Donatist bishops. But all the eloquence and strength of argument made use of by these divines, although seconded by the penal decrees of the emperor Honorius, were unsuccessful in producing a recantation of their errors, or a peaceful union with their brethren. In support of the Catholic faith, Alypius appears to have vigorously ex-\nAlyssum ered his talents; and it is much to be regretted that the means he employed for that purpose were not at all times the most honourable; for in the violence of his zeal he went as deputy from the churches of Africa to the emperor Honorius, in order to obtain severe decrees against the sect of the Pelagians. Although Alypius failed in his attempt to reclaim the Donatists from error, yet he was successful with the emperor in obtaining penal decrees against the Pelagians; in consequence of which their ministers were banished, their churches demolished, and their assemblies discontinued. Alypius died about the year 432, and his dispositions appear to have participated more of the violence of zeal, than of the meekness of charity. (Gen.

It is situated in E. Long. 72. 12. N. Lat. 23. 0. Amadabat was formerly called Guzerat; and by Shah Jehan nicknamed Gheraluddin, or \"the habitation of dust,\" because it was much incommode therewith. It was the seat of the Guzerat kings, as it is now of the Mogul governor. The city stands in a beautiful plain, and is watered by the little river Sabremetti, which, though not deep, in time of rains overflows the plains prodigiously. The walls are built with stone and brick, flanked at certain distances with great round towers and battlements. It has twelve gates; and, including the suburbs, is about four miles and a half long. The streets are wide. The Meydan Shah, or king's square, is 700 paces long, and 400 broad, planted round with trees. On the west side is the castle, well walled with free stone, and as spacious as a little city; but its inward appearance is not conformable to its external magnificence. The caravanserai is on the south of the square, and its chief ornament. Near the Meydan also is the king's palace, whose apartments are richly ornamented; and in the midst of the city is the English factory, where they purchase fine chintz, calicoes, and other Indian merchandise. The place is so full of gardens flooded with fruit trees, that from an eminence it looks like a wood. The Hindoos have here an hospital for sick beasts, and another for sick birds, which they take great care of. According to some late accounts, this city is little inferior to the best in Europe, and is thought to yield ten times as much revenue as Surat.\n\nAMADAN, or Hamadan, a town of Persia, between Taurus and Ilpahan. E. Long. 47. 4. N. Lat. 35. 15. It is seated at the foot of a mountain, where there are a great many springs, which water the adjacent country. The extent of the city is very large; but there are a great many waste spots within it, as well as cultivated land. The houses are built of brick hardened in the sun, and have but a very indifferent aspect. There is but one tolerable street; and that is where stuffs, garments, and the like, are exposed to sale: it is straight, long, and wide; and the shops are very well furnished. The adjacent parts are fruitful in corn and rice, insomuch that the neighbouring provinces are supplied from hence. It is said to enjoy a very salubrious air; but the cold in winter is intense. The Armenians have a church in this town; but it is a very ill contrived structure. The Jews have a synagogue near a tomb, where they pretend Esther and Mordecai lie interred. To this place they come in pilgrimage from several parts of the Levant. About a league from Amadan, there is a mountain called Nalliana, which abounds with all sorts of curious herbs. In the spring, people flock to this mountain from all parts to recover their health, by sucking in the salutary effluvia with their breath.\n\nAmadan is a very ancient city. It is said to have been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, and rebuilt by Darius, who brought hither all his riches. The kings of Persia frequently retired to this place on account of its delightful situation; for which reason it obtained the name of the Royal City. It was conquered by the caliph Othman, and narrowly escaped being destroyed by Jenghiz Khan in 1220. It had then strong walls and a good castle, which are now in ruins. Its present beauty consists in its gardens and springs.\n\nAMADANAGER, a town in the hither peninsula of India, in the province of Decan. E. Long. 74. 15. N. Lat. 18. 10. It was taken by the Moguls in 1508, after a siege of six months; being at that time defended by a strong castle, situated on an eminence, and surrounded with deep ditches, into which several springs discharged their waters.\n\nAMADEUS V., count of Savoy, arose to that dignity in the year 1285. In him it appeared, that mental excellence can rise superior to riches or extent of territory; for although his dominions were by no means extensive, nor his riches great, yet, in consequence of his wisdom and success, he obtained the surname of Great. The cautious prudence of Amadeus, however, enabled him greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations. In this situation, with extended dominion, and distinguished for wisdom and prudence, he rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was constituted their umpire to settle their differences; and in that station acquitted himself with much reputation and general\nBut in his character valour and wisdom were combined; for when the Turks attempted to retake the isle of Rhodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he boldly defended it, and acquired great renown. A Maltese cross with the letters F.E.R.T. in future became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this signal victory. The explanation of this motto is said to be Fortitudo ejus Rhodium tenuit.—\"His valour kept Rhodes.\" For this important service the grand master conferred on him the grant of a palace at Lyons. Andronicus the emperor of the east had married his daughter; and in order to promote the views of his son-in-law, Amadeus took a journey to Avignon to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour of Andronicus. In the year 1323 the famous Amadeus died at that place. Deep penetration, keen discernment, consummate prudence, great valour, together with no small portion of the religious superstition of his time, appear to have been the reigning features in his character. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAmadeus VIII. count of Savoy, in 1391, succeeded his father Amadeus VII. With the large sum of 4,000 florins of gold he purchased the country of Genevois from its last earl. Anxious to extend his territories, he purchased the city of Rumilly, upon the lake of Geneva, from the widow of the count of Genevois, and thus the house of Savoy became so illustrious that the emperor Sigismund erected Savoy into a duchy in the year 1426. Historians relate, that he assisted John Paleologus against the duke of Milan, who endeavoured to wrest from him the duchy of Montferrat. Deeply sensible of the services which he had received, Paleologus not only resigned to the duke, Chivas, Brandis, and several other estates, but submitted to hold all the marquisate of Montferrat as a fief from the house of Savoy. These fortunate acquisitions of territory were not yet limited; for upon the marriage of his daughter with Philip Maria, duke of Milan, he received Vercelli, and about the same time the count of Crefcentino submitted to become his feudatory. In his ambitious pursuit, he laid claim to the sovereignty of the city of Geneva; but that claim, though enforced by the pope, was rejected by the citizens with disdain, and the emperor Sigismund taking it under his protection, declared it an imperial city. After such an extensive acquisition of dominion, and amassing such sums of money, he formed the singular scheme of abandoning his throne and family; and for that purpose retired to a religious house at a place called Ripaille. But although he resigned the dukedom of Savoy to his eldest son Lewis, and made his youngest son Philip, count of Genevois; yet their honours were merely nominal, for he constrained them to live on a very scanty allowance, while he in his retirement received all the revenues, and collected such sums of money that he is said to have purchased the papal honours. During the previous part of his life having adopted great sanctity of manners, the motives for his retirement were generally reckoned religious; but what was the astonishment of mankind to behold the seat of his hermitage become the habitation of every rare delicacy, and of the most refined luxury. The local situation of the place was truly delightful, and was enriched with every thing that could afford gratification to the senses; and his residence confirmed some of his most intimate friends, along with 20 faithful servants, who were the guardians of his voluptuous secrets. Neither did he assume a religious habit, but wore purple robes, and upon his mantle was embroidered a golden cross. His table groaned under the weight of luxurious dainties, and the most excellent music cheered the daily feast; in short, such was the voluptuousness of that place, that in the French language the phrase, faire ripaille, signifies to make exquisite good cheer.\n\nHe instituted a secular knighthood in that place under the appellation of St Maurice. The brethren assumed the name of hermits, wore beards, and excluded women from their community; and in other respects composed the character of decent epicures.\n\nWhen he obtained the papal dignity, and was crowned by the cardinal of Arles at Basil, all Europe was filled with astonishment in consequence of his elevation; for he had never entered into holy orders. But he had found means to remove every objection, the council confirmed his election, and with pretended reluctance he put on the pontifical ornaments, and was consecrated in the church of St Maurice. It seemed good to Amadeus to assume the title of Felix V. As might naturally be expected in such circumstances, the papal dignity was severely contested between him and Eugenius; and notwithstanding all the importunities of the council, the emperor refused to acknowledge his elevation. This religious dispute involved all Europe in contention. Historians relate that Germany remained neutral, and France, England, Italy, Spain, and Hungary, declared for Eugenius; but Arragon, Poland, and Bretagne recognized the council only; at the same time that Savoy, Switzerland, Basil, Strasbourg, Pomerania, and one of the duchies of Bavaria, recognized Felix. The emperor Frederick III. held a council at Frankfort, before which both the popes urged their respective rights by means of deputies. This attempt, however, to regain peace to Europe was unsuccessful; therefore the emperor repaired to the vicinity of Basil, and had a personal interview with Felix. The mind of Amadeus was now so confirmed in the enjoyment of pleasure, that he had again returned to his favourite retreat; and after the fathers of the council had frequently solicited him in vain to reside at Basil, he prevailed upon them to remove to Lyons, which was near the seat of his pleasures. During the contest, Eugenius had excommunicated Felix, the council, and several of the German princes, so that the whole church was then filled with confusion and disorder. The death of Eugenius, however, terminated the struggle; for upon his death the cardinals at Rome elected Thomas de Sarzan, who assumed the name of Nicholas V. In this situation of affairs, Amadeus deemed it prudent to enter into a negotiation for the resignation of his papal crown. In this transaction he displayed the profoundest policy and address, which induced Nicholas to annul all that Eugenius had done to his dishonour, or that of his associates; to confirm the determination of the council of Basil to appoint him perpetual apostolical legate in Savoy, Piedmont, and the other places of his own dominions, and even added to these the honour of being bishop of Basil, Lausanne, Strasbourg,\nAmadeus Strasburg, and Constance. Nor did his vanity forsake him even in this political transaction, for he provided that he should continue to wear the pontifical dress unless in very few particulars. In order to gratify the same haughty disposition, he stipulated that he should not be obliged to go to Rome, to attend any general council; and that when he had occasion to approach the pope, he should rise to receive him, and instead of kissing his toe, he should be permitted to kiss his cheek. Amadeus retired to Lausanne, and died there at the age of 60, in the year 1451.\n\nAs the time in which he lived is fertile in memorable events, so the character of Amadeus was one of the most distinguished of his time. The versatility of his genius has led writers to differ in the delineation of his character. Some have represented him as a person of singular sanctity of manners, and possessed of uncommon moderation and virtue; others have represented him as a confirmed bigot, and a violent enthusiast; and a third class of authors have magnified his talents far above the general standard, and extolled him as one of the most accomplished princes in Europe. His real character appears to be a compound of extravagancies, in which virtue, genius, caprice, and vanity were blended. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAMADEUS IX., count of Savoy, succeeded his father Lewis, in his dominion and honours. The prince who exerts his talents to promote the happiness of his subjects, is worthy of more fame than the prince who increases the number of his subjects by unjust and unnecessary wars. In this view Amadeus IX. deserves a place in the annals of his nation. His bodily constitution was weak, and he was afflicted with the falling-sickness, yet, in consequence of his piety, virtue, benevolence, and justice, he was named the Happy. The clemency of his temper was such that he readily pardoned those who offended him, and in few instances was he induced to punish. In his character, however, the virtue of benevolence shone with peculiar splendour among the other virtues of the Christian. A foreign minister one day used the freedom to inquire at Amadeus, if he kept any hounds. The duke replied, \"a great number, and you shall see them to-morrow at noon.\" The minister attended at that hour in expectation of seeing a numerous pack of hounds; but the duke led him to a window which looked into an extensive square, and directing his view to a multitude of poor people eating and drinking, he exclaimed, \"These are my hounds with whom I go in chase of heaven.\"\n\nIn all these pious and benevolent labours he was seconded by his wife Isolande of France. When one of his parsimonious courtiers reminded him that he would spend all his revenues, he generously replied, \"Here is the collar of my order, let them sell it and relieve my people.\" In the seventh year of his reign, and the thirty-seventh of his life, he died universally lamented by all his loyal subjects, in the year 1472. In high esteem for his virtuous qualities, his subjects conferred on him the appellation of The Blest. (Mod. Univ. Hist.)\n\nAMADIA, a trading town of Asia, in Cilicia, belonging to the Turks; seated on a high mountain. E. Long. 43. 1. N. Lat. 36. 25.\n\nAMADOW, a kind of black match, tinder, or touchwood, which comes from Germany. It is made of a sort of large mushrooms or spongy excrescences, Amadowry which commonly grow on old trees, especially oaks, ash, and firs. This substance being boiled in common water, and afterwards dried and well beaten, is then put into a strong ley prepared with saltpetre, after which it is again put to dry in an oven. The drug-gifts fell this match wholesale in France, and several hawkers retail it. Some give to the amadow the name of pyrotechnical sponge, because of its aptness to take fire.\n\nAMADOWRY, a kind of cotton which comes from Alexandria by the way of Marseilles.\n\nAMAIN, in the Sea Language, a term importing to lower something at once. Thus, to strike amain, is to lower or let fall the topsails; to wave amain, is to make a signal, by waving a drawn sword, or the like, as a demand that the enemy strike their topsails.\n\nAMAK, a small island in the Baltic sea, near Copenhagen, from which it is separated by a canal over which there is a drawbridge. Amak is about four miles long and two broad; and is chiefly peopled by the descendants of a colony from East Friesland, to whom the island was configned by Christian II., at the request of his wife Elizabeth, sister of Charles V., for the purpose of supplying her with vegetables, cheese, and butter. From the intermarriages of these colonists with the Danes, the present inhabitants are chiefly descended; but as they wear their own dress, and enjoy peculiar privileges, they appear a distinct race from the natives. The island contains about six villages, and between 3000 and 4000 souls. It has two churches, in which the ministers preach occasionally in Dutch and Danish. The inhabitants have their own inferior tribunals; but in capital offences are amenable to the king's court of justice at Copenhagen. The old national habit, brought by the original colony when they first migrated to the island, is still in use amongst them. It resembles the habit of the ancient Quakers, as represented in the pictures of the Dutch and Flemish painters. The men wear broad-brimmed hats, black jackets, full glazed breeches of the same colour, loose at the knee, and tied round the waist. The women were drefted chiefly in black jackets and petticoats, with a piece of blue glazed cloth bound on their heads. The island is laid out in gardens and pastures; and still, according to the original design, supplies Copenhagen with milk, butter, and vegetables. E. Long. 12. 10. N.

Deprived of his father when an infant, he would have been bereft of his crown, had not his grandfather Theodoric king of the Ostrogoths interposed in his behalf. In defence of the royal infant, he expelled from the throne his natural brother, who had usurped the government and ruled the kingdom during his life, and preserved the crown to the natural heir. In 526 the grandfather died, and Amalaric assumed the royal authority. In 517 he married Clotilda, the daughter of Clovis, an amiable lady, who inherited both the piety and orthodoxy of her mother, who was of the same name. The Catholic historians\nAmalaricians relate, that the king being violently attached to Amalafontha, embraced the Arian cause, used means to compel his queen to embrace the same opinions; which participated more of cruelty than piety. With all the firmness of a great mind, and the amiable patience of a Christian, she endured her wrongs for a considerable period; but at length, worn out with injurious treatment, she was forced to apply to her brothers for assistance, and sent them a handkerchief stained with her blood in proof of her cruel usage. In order to relieve their sister, one of them, Childebert king of Paris, entered the territories of Amalaric, who then resided with his court at Narbonne; and their different forces having joined battle, the troops of Amalaric were totally defeated, and the king himself forced to save his life by flying into Spain, A.D. 531. It is reported that, when endeavouring to regain Narbonne, he was slain either by an assassin employed by Theudis his successor, or that he fell in battle. Some historians again say, that he died in Barcelona. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAMALAFONTHA, youngest daughter of Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, was born about the year 498. The sister of Clovis was her mother, and in 515, she married Eutharic, the only remaining heir of the legal race of the Amali. Her father having formed the design of making him his successor, he sent to bring him from Spain for that purpose. But he never arrived at the destined honour; for Eutharic died previous to his father-in-law, and his only son Athalaric, was also bereft of his grandfather at the age of eight years. The well-known abilities of Amalafontha induced Theodoric to place Athalaric, to whom he had left the kingdom of Italy, under the care of his mother. This princess inherited an ample share of her father's talents; and her father had been exceedingly careful to improve these natural endowments by means of a liberal education. She became a great proficient in the philosophy and morals of that age, and with equal elegance and grace she could converse in the Greek, Latin, and Gothic languages. Nor were her talents merely qualified to adorn private life; she displayed them in the administration of public justice, and political discussion. Her first efforts were in behalf of the injured children of Boethius and Symmachus, whom she reinstated in the possession of their inheritance. When the chiefs of the Goths were strongly inclined to treat the Romans as a conquered people, she mildly restrained their violent oppression and their ungovernable rapacity. Adorning the female character she relieved her subjects from some of the severer impositions of her father; but carefully retained all his laws, magistrates, and political institutions. Having herself tasted of the sweets of literature, and experienced its advantages, she patronized learning with an affluous care, by regularly paying the salaries of public teachers, and giving every encouragement to the improvement of genius. Her peaceable deportment towards the neighbouring princes forms an amiable feature in her character. Both with the imperial court, and with all the other powers, she lived upon agreeable terms, and thus universal prosperity and honour prevailed. Both in consequence of maternal affection and the high cultivation of her mind, she exerted all her ingenuity in the education of her orphan son. Unfortunately, however, both for the mother and the son, neither the general character of the Gothic nation, nor the wayward inclinations of the boy, seconded her laudable endeavours.\n\nThe Gothic nobles had just commenced their murmurs against the soft effeminate manner in which their prince was educating, when, upon a certain day, the youth having undergone some kind maternal chastisement, rushed into the room where some of the nobles were assembled, with the tears streaming from his eyes. Informed of the cause of his distress, the wrath of the nobles suddenly arose, and in a violent burst of passion they insisted upon the immediate release of their prince from the bondage of learning and from the restraints of a mother. The unfortunate youth was thus dragged from the habitation of learning, prudence, and virtue; and plunged into all the extravagancies of dissolute pleasure, and his mind inspired with contempt and aversion to his virtuous mother.\n\nIt was impossible for humanity to bear this insult and high injury without opposition; therefore, in the first effusions of her resentment she seized three of the principal persons concerned in this transaction, and confined them in one of the remotest parts of Italy. But the efforts of one, or of a few individuals, are never adequate to the task of counteracting the general efforts of a nation, for the party whose sentiments were opposed to her's, grew daily in magnitude and strength, to such a degree that Amalafontha formed serious resolutions of sheltering herself under the protection of Justinian. After a correspondence had been carried on to prepare for this event, and when she was about to sail for that place, she determined to make one bold effort to regain her absolute power. With this view, she caused the three persons who were in confinement to be secretly assassinated; and this action re-established her authority, although it augmented the public hatred. But another cause of disquiet soon arose. At the early age of fifteen, her son fell a victim to his debaucheries and follies, and she was left devoid of any legal claim to the crown. The accomplished and ambitious Amalafontha spurned the idea of retiring to a private station, and formed the bold design of sharing the throne with Theodorus her cousin. She had sufficient penetration to perceive that the dispositions of that youth were indolent and weak, and consequently she hoped still to remain at the helm of government. But the future fortune of that accomplished woman, demonstrates to posterity the danger of confiding in human weaknesses, where the principles of honour and justice and virtue are wanting. Theodorus issued an order for her confinement in an island in the lake Bolfena; and in the year 535 she was strangled in the bath. Some historians ascribe this action to the influence of the empress Theodora, who was seized with jealousy in consequence of the respect shown her by Justinian. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAMALEK, the son of Eliphaz, by Timna his concubine, and the grandson of Esau, Gen. xxxvi. 12, and 1 Chr. i. 36. Amalek succeeded Gatam in the government of Edom. He was the father of the Amalekites, a powerful people who dwelt in Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, or between Hava and Shur (1 Sam. xv. 7); sometimes in one canton and sometimes in another. It does not appear that they\nthey had cities; for there is no mention of any but one in the Scriptures (id. ib. 5.) ; they living generally in hamlets, caves, or tents.\n\nThe Israelites had scarcely passed the Red sea on their way to the wilderness before the Amalekites came to attack them in the defects of Rephidim (Ex. xvii. 8 &c.) ; and put those cruelly to the sword who were obliged, either through fatigue or weakness, to remain behind. Moses, by divine command, directed Joshua to fall upon this people; to record the act of inhumanity which they had committed in a book, in order to have it always before his eyes; and to revenge it in the most remarkable manner. Joshua therefore fell upon the Amalekites and defeated them, while Moses was upon the mountain, with Aaron and Hur in company. Moses, during the time of the engagement, held up his hands, to which the success of the battle was owing; for as often as he let them down, Amalek prevailed. But Moses's hands being tired, Aaron and Hur supported his arms, and held them extended, while the battle lasted, which was from morning till the approach of night, when the Amalekites were cut in pieces. This happened in the year of the world 2513, before Christ 1491.\n\nThe ground of the enmity of the Amalekites against the Israelites is generally supposed to have been an innate hatred, from the remembrance of Jacob's depriving their progenitor both of his birthright and blessing. Their falling upon them, however, and that without any provocation, when they saw them reduced to so low a condition by the fatigue of their march, and the excessive drought they laboured under, was an inhuman action, and justly deserved the defeat which Joshua gave them. Under the Judges (v. 3.), we see the Amalekites united with the Midianites and Moabites, in a design to oppress Israel; but Ehud delivered the Israelites from Eglon king of the Moabites (Judges iii.), and Gideon (chap. viii.) delivered them from the Midianites and Amalekites. About the year of the world 2930, Saul marched against the Amalekites, advanced as far as their capital, and put all the people of the country to the sword; but spared the best of the cattle and moveables, contrary to a divine command; which act of disobedience was the cause of Saul's future misfortunes.\n\nAfter this war, the Amalekites scarcely appear any more in history. However, about the year of the world 2949, a troop of Amalekites came and pillaged Ziklag, which belonged to David (1 Sam. xxxi.), where he had left his two wives Ahinoam and Abigail; but he returning from an expedition which he had made in the company of Achish into the valley of Jezreel, pursued them, overtook and dispersed them, and recovered all the booty which they had carried off from Ziklag.\n\nThe Arabians maintain Amalek to have been the son of Ham, and grandson of Noah; that he was the father of Ad, and grandfather of Schedad. Calmet thinks that this opinion is by no means to be rejected, as it is not very probable that Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, and grandson of Esau, should be the father of a people so powerful and numerous as the Amalekites were when the Israelites departed out of Egypt. Moses in the book of Genesis (xiv. 7.) relates, that in Abraham's time, long before the birth of Amalek the son of Eliphaz, the five confederate kings carried the war into Amalek's country, about Kedesh; and into that of the Amorites, about Hazazon-tamar. The same Moses (Num. xxiv. 20.) relates, that the diviner Balaam, observing at a distance the land of Amalek, said, in his prophetic style, \"Amalek is the first, the head, the original of the nations; but his latter end shall be, that he perish for ever.\" Our commentator observes, that this epithet of the first of nations cannot certainly agree with the Amalekites descended from the son of Eliphaz, because the generation then living was but the third from Amalek. Besides, Moses never reproaches the Amalekites with attacking their brethren the Israelites; an aggravating circumstance, which he would not have omitted were the Amalekites descended from Esau; in which case they had been the brethren of the Israelites. Lastly, we see the Amalekites almost always joined in the Scripture with the Canaanites and Philistines, and never with the Edomites; and when Saul made war upon the Amalekites, and almost utterly destroyed them, we do not find that the Edomites made the least motion towards their affluence, nor to revenge them afterwards. Thence it is thought probable, that the Amalekites, who are so often mentioned in Scripture, were a free people descended from Canaan, and devoted to the curse as well as the other Amorites, and very different from the descendants of Amalek, the grandson of Esau.\n\nThe accounts which the Arabians give us of the Amalekites destroyed by Saul are as follow: Amalek was the father of an ancient tribe in Arabia, exterminated in the reign of Saul. This tribe contained only the Arabians who are called Pure; the remains whereof were mingled with the posterity of Joktan and Adnan, and so became Mofarabes or Moslaarabes; that is to say, Arabians blended with foreign nations. They further believe, that Goliath, who was overcome by David, was king of the Amalekites; and that the giants who inhabited Palestine in Joshua's time were of the same race. That at last part of the Amalekites retired into Africa while Joshua was yet living, and settled upon the coasts of Barbary, along the Mediterranean sea. The son of Amalek was Ad, a celebrated prince among the Arabians. Some make him the son of Uz, and grandson of Aram the son of Shem. Let this be as it will, the Mahometans say that Ad was the father of an Arabian tribe called Adites; who were exterminated, as they tell us, for not hearkening to the patriarch Eber, who preached the unity of God to them. Ad had two sons, Schedad and Schedid.\n\nAMALFI, an ancient city of Italy, situated in E. Long. 15° 20'. N. Lat. 40° 35'. It is said to have derived its origin from a number of Roman families, who, about the middle of the fourth century, either from private views of emolument, or in consequence of compulsory orders from the emperor, had left Rome, and embarked for Constantinople; but meeting with storms on their passage, were cast away on the shores of Salerno, and deprived of the means of pursuing their voyage. In this state of perplexity they long remained; but at last came to the resolution of settling on the present site of Amalfi, where they expected to enjoy security, and sufficient plenty of the necessaries of life. The earliest notice of them in this settlement dates no higher than the latter end of the fifth century. Im-\npervious mountains and inaccessible coasts preserved their infant state from the first fury of the Lombards, who seldom attempted the conquest of a maritime people.\n\nIn the year 825, when this little republic had, under the patronage of the eastern emperors, attained a degree of wealth and reputation sufficient to excite the ambition of its neighbours, Sico, prince of Salerno, marched a body of troops by night, surprized Amalfi; and, carrying off the greatest part of the inhabitants, compelled them to fix at Salerno, which had lately suffered a great loss of people by an epidemical disorder. But before the fourth year of their captivity was expired, the Amalitans took advantage of the absence of the Salernitan chiefs, who were then carrying on a war with the Beneventans; armed themselves; and, after burning and plundering Salerno, marched in triumph back to their own country.\n\nHere they framed a better system of government, and reformed many abuses in their former legislation; adopting various measures that were likely to promote internal concord, and defeat the evil intentions of foreign enemies. Their first plan was to vest the supreme authority in a temporary prefect; but the experience of a few years caused them to prefer lodging that power in the hands of a duke elected for the term of his natural life. Under these governors Amalfi attained the summit of her military and commercial glory. It extended its territory, which reached eastward from Vico Vecchio, and westward to the promontory of Minerva, including likewise the island of Caprea, and the two islands of the Galli. Towards the north, it comprehended the cities of Lettere, Gragnans, Pimontio, and Capule di Franchi; towards the south, those of Scala, Ravelli, Mioni, Majuri, Atrani, Tramonti, Aggerula, Citara, Praiano, and Rosflano.\n\nLeo IV. found the Amalitans an useful ally in his wars with the Infidels, and honoured the commonwealth with the title of Defender of the Faith. The Neapolitans, with whom, as Greek vassals, they were united in strict bonds of friendship, experienced many signal favours at their hands; and the Muslims themselves found it expedient to court their alliance, and to enter into treaty with them. Their situation had from the beginning given them a turn to commerce, and their attention to naval affairs so much consequence in the eyes of their protector, the emperor of Constantinople, that by his orders a court was established at Amalfi, for the decision of all controversies arising in maritime transactions. Its code and reports became the general rule in those cases throughout this part of Europe; its precedents and decrees were allowed to be good authority to found judgment upon even in foreign tribunals. To crown the mercantile and naval glory of the republic, it was referred to the lot of an Amalitan to make, or at least to perfect, the most important discovery ever made for the improvement of navigation. Paestano, a village which stands on the shore a few miles west of Amalfi, boasts of having given birth to Flavius Gioia, the inventor of the mariner's compass.\n\nThe merchants of this town engrossed the trade of the Levant, and transacted the commercial business of the world in a lucrative and exclusive manner. The Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, rose upon their ruin; and, after monopolizing the emoluments of trade for Amalfi for ages, made way for the more comprehensive and daring spirit of the present maritime powers.\n\nAt present Amalfi is subject to Naples, and is the see of an archbishop. It is but a shadow of what it was in its flourishing state, when it extended over the stupendous rocks that hang on each side, still crowned with battlemented walls and ruined towers. Its buildings, Mr Swinburne says, are not remarkable for elegance or size; and contain at most 4000 inhabitants, who seem to be in a poor line of life. The cathedral is an uncut building. Under the choir is the chapel and tomb of the apostle St Andrew; to whose honour the edifice was dedicated, when Cardinal Capuano, in 1268, brought his body from Constantinople.\n\nAMALGAM, mercury united with some metal.\n\nAMALGAMATION, the operation of making an amalgam, or mixing mercury with any metal.\n\nFor the combination of one metal with another, it is generally sufficient that one of them be in a state of fluidity. Mercury being always fluid, is therefore capable of amalgamation with other metals without heat; nevertheless, heat considerably facilitates the operation.\n\nTo amalgamate without heat requires nothing more than rubbing the two metals together in a mortar; but the metal to be united with the mercury should be previously divided into very thin plates or grains. When heat is used (which is always most effectual, and with some metals indispensably necessary), the mercury should be heated till it begins to smoke, and the grains of metal made red hot before they are thrown into it. If it be gold or silver, it is sufficient to stir the fluid with an iron rod for a little while, and then throw it into a vessel filled with water. This amalgam is used for gilding or silvering on copper, which is afterwards exposed to a degree of heat sufficient to evaporate the mercury.\n\nAmalgamation with lead or tin is effected by pouring an equal weight of mercury into either of these metals in a state of fusion, and stirring with an iron rod. Copper amalgamates with great difficulty, and iron not at all.\n\nAMALTHAEA, the name of the Cumæan Sibyl, who offered to Tarquinius Superbus nine books, containing the Roman destinies, and demanded 300 pieces of gold for them. He derided her; whereupon she threw three of them into the fire; and returning, asked the same price for the other six; which being demanded, she burnt three more; and returned, still demanding the same price. Upon which Tarquin consulting the pontiffs, was advised to buy them. These books were in such esteem, that two magistrates were created to consult them upon extraordinary occasions.\n\nAMALTHÆA, in Pagan Mythology, the daughter of Melampus, king of Crete, and the nurse of Jupiter, whom she fed with goats milk and honey. According to others, Amalthæa was a goat, which Jupiter translated into the sky, with her two kids, and gave one of her horns to the daughters of Melampus, as a reward for the pains they had taken in attending him. This horn had the peculiar property of furnishing them with whatever they wished for; and was thence called the cornucopia, or horn of plenty.\n\nAMALTHÆUS,\nAMALTHEUS, Jerome, John Baptist, and Corneille, three celebrated Latin poets of Italy, who flourished in the 16th century. Their compositions were printed at Amsterdam in 1685. One of the prettiest pieces in that collection is an epigram on two children, whose beauty was very extraordinary, though each of them was deprived of an eye:\n\n*Lumine Acon dextro, capta est Leonilla sinistro:\nEt poterat forma vincere uterque Deos,\nParve puero, lumen quod habes concede sorori;\nSic tu cecus Amor, sic erit illa Venus.*\n\nAMAMA, Sixtinus, professor of the Hebrew tongue in the university of Franeker, a man of great learning, was born in Frieland, and had studied under Drusius. He published a criticism upon the translation of the Pentateuch; collated the Dutch translation of the Bible with the original and the most accurate translations; and wrote a censure of the Vulgate translation of the historical books of the Old Testament, Job, the Psalms, and Canticles. It is impossible to answer the reasons whereby he shows the necessity of consulting the originals. This he recommended so earnestly, that some synods, being influenced by his reasons, decreed, that none should be admitted into the ministry, but such as had a competent knowledge of the Hebrew and Greek text of the Scriptures. He died in 1629.\n\nAMANCE, a town in the duchy of Lorraine, upon a rivulet of the same name. E. Long. 6° 10'. N. Lat. 48° 45'.\n\nAMAND, Mark Anthony Gerard, Sieur de St., a French poet, was born at Rouen in Normandy in 1594. In the epistle dedicatory to the third part of his works, he tells us, that his father commanded a squadron of ships in the service of Elizabeth queen of England for 22 years, and that he was for three years prisoner in the Black Tower at Constantinople. He mentions also that two brothers of his had been killed in an engagement against the Turks. His own life was spent in a continual succession of travels, which was of no advantage to his fortune. There are miscellaneous poems of this author, the greatest part of which are of the comic or burlesque, and the amorous kind. Though there are many blemishes in his poems, yet he had the talent of reading them in so agreeable a manner, that every one was charmed with them. In 1650, he published *Stances sur la gracieuse de la reine de Pologne et de Suede*. There are six stanzas of nine verses each. In 1653, he printed his *Moife sauvé, idylle heroique*. This poem had at first many admirers; M. Chapelein called it a *speaking picture*; but it has since fallen into contempt. Amand wrote also a very devout piece, entitled, *Stances à M. Corneille, sur son invitation de Jésus Christ*, which was printed at Paris in 1656. M. Brossette says, that he wrote also a poem upon the moon, wherein he paid a compliment to Lewis XIV. upon his skill in swimming, in which he used often to exercise himself when he was young, in the river Seine; but the king could not bear this poem to be read to him, which is said to have affected the author to such a degree, that he did not survive it long. He died in 1661, being 67 years of age. He was admitted a member of the French academy, when it was first founded by Cardinal Richelieu, in the year 1633; and Mr Pelisson informs us, that in 1637, at his own desire, he was excused from the obligation of making a speech in his turn, on condition that he would compile the comic part of the dictionary which the Academy had undertaken, and collect the burlesque terms. This was a task well suited to him; for it appears by his writings, that he was extremely conversant in these terms, of which he seems to have made a complete collection from the markets, and other places where the lower people resort.\n\nAMAND, Saint, a city of France, in the department of Cher, formerly Bourbonois, on the confines of Berry, seated on the river Cher.

This feast was solemnized with entertainments, balls, masquerades, and the like diversions, and continued from evening till the next morning.—That princes, thinking the name too vulgar, changed it into that of the *feast of the gods*, in regard each person here represented some deity as it fell to his lot. The queen assumed the name of *Amarante*; that is, unfading, or immortal. The young nobility, dressed in the habit of nymphs and shepherds, served the gods at the table. At the end of the feast, the queen threw off her habit, which was covered with diamonds, leaving it to be pulled in pieces by the masques; and in memory of so gallant a feast, founded a military order, called in Swedish *Gefechtchafft*, into which all that had been present at the feast were admitted, including 16 lords and as many ladies, besides the queen. Their device was the cypher of *Amarante*, composed of two A's, the one erect, the other inverted, and interwoven together; the whole enclosed by a laurel crown, with this motto, *Dolce nella memoria*.\nBulstrode Whitlock, the English ambassador from Cromwell to the court of Sweden, was made a knight of the order of Amaranthe; on which account it seems to be, that we sometimes find him styled Sir Bulstrode Whitlock.\n\nAMARANTHOIDES, in Botany, the trivial name of a species of illecebrum.

King Apries having sent an army to the assistance of the Libyans, which was totally routed, and great multitudes put to death, the common people conceived the idea, that the tyrannical prince had sent them to the field of battle, for no other purpose but to destroy great numbers of them, so he might reign over the remainder with uncontrolled oppression. The consequence was, that a general insurrection arose, and all the multitude were in an uproar. Informed of this tumult, Apries sent Amasis, whom he deemed one of his most faithful adherents; but instead of endeavouring to reconcile the disaffected people to their prince, he secured them to his own interest; and while he was pretending to reproach their disloyalty, and endeavouring to recall them to duty, a folder stepped in behind him, and placing a helmet upon his head, saluted him king of Egypt. Amasis instantly took the field against his royal master, and prepared to drive him from his throne. Apprised of the treachery of Amasis, he sent another in whom he confided, to bring Amasis before him, to give an account of his conduct. This messenger met him on horseback, and having delivered his message, Amasis after some insolent behaviour, replied, that he was preparing to visit the king, but thought it proper to bring a suitable equipage to attend him. When the messenger hastened back to inform his master, that he might consult for himself, his only reward was to have his ears and nose cut off, by the order of the tyrant, because he brought not Amasis along with him. In this, as in numerous other instances, tyranny procured its own destruction; for the rest of the nobles who still remained obedient to the king, seeing the barbarous manner in which he had treated the messenger, they all went over to the standard of the usurper. Now all the nation was in commotion. The usurper on the one hand, with the whole body of the natives marshalled under his banner, and the tyrant on the other hand, with a body of foreigners and mercenaries, which he had engaged in his service. The two armies met in a field in the vicinity of Memphis, and the tyrant was made captive and his forces defeated. The usurper treated the captive tyrant with great lenity and respect, and assigned him the palace of Saïs for his confinement. But the hatred of the people was too violent towards their old king, to permit him to live; Amasis was therefore forced to deliver him into their hands, and they instantly put him to death by strangling him.\n\nThe plebeian extraction of Amasis deprived him for some time of that respect, to which he was entitled as a prince; but observing this, he contrived a stratagem to induce them to pay him suitable honour. He ordered a golden cistern, in which his visitants were accustomed to wash their feet, to be melted and cast in the form of a god, and set it up in the most frequented part of the city, and all the inhabitants did it homage. He then called an assembly of the people, and reminded them, that the gold they now venerated in the form of a god, was once a cistern, and consequently that although he was formerly a person of low rank, yet now that he was their king, they ought to give him the respect and homage due to his station.\n\nHaving by this means provided for the gratification of his vanity, he began to exert himself to act for the general good of his people. It was his constant practice to attend to business in the mornings, and in the evenings he indulged in amusement and pleasure; but in these he sometimes tarnished the dignity of a king. Indeed Amasis loved his wine and his companion too much, previous to his elevation, that it is reported that he lived by theft, and when denying upon detection, he was carried to the oracle of the place, who sometimes condemned and sometimes acquitted him. Recollecting the conduct of the oracles after he ascended the throne, he conceived a disrespect for them, because they were not able at all times to detect his robberies.\n\nTo prevent the evil consequences of an indolent populace, he enacted a law, that every person, under the penalty of capital punishment, should appear before the governor of his respective province, and declare by what occupation he acquired his subsistence. Thus, under the prudent government of Amasis, Egypt enjoyed for many years, great fertility and extensive population. He also employed his industry in the erection of several public works; among which were a portico to the temple of Minerva at Saïs, and the removal of a house, all of one stone, to the temple. He also\nAMATRICE, a city of the kingdom of Naples in the farther Abruzzo, upon the confines of the pope's territories, and the marquisate of Ancona.\n\nAMATTA, Foa, an island in the Southern Pacific ocean, which was discovered by Captain Cook in 1774.

There is a periodical sort which comes on instantaneously, continues for hours, or days, and then disappears.\n\nAMAZIAH, one of the kings of Judah, ascended the throne of his father Joash in the 25th year of his age. His mother's name was Jehodan, a native of Jerusalem. In consequence of his wavering virtue, and his mingling foreign idolatry with the worship of the true God, he is said, according to Scripture, to have done that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but \"not with a perfect heart.\" His father had been ungenerously murdered by his own servants, therefore his son, on his elevation to the throne, put to death the murderers of his father. In this act of retributive justice, however, he showed a becoming respect to the law of Moses, which prohibited the punishing of the children for the crimes of their guilty fathers. He gave early proofs of his military talents, by making a general muster of all his subjects able to bear arms; and likewise hired a numerous army from the neighbouring kingdom of Israel; and with this increased multitude he hastened to attack Edom. The two kindred armies met together in the valley of Salt, and, after an obstinate engagement, the Edomites were put to flight; and Amaziah from thence proceeded to take the town of Selah. But the spirit of jealousy arose between the two armies, so that Amaziah thought it prudent not to make use of the arms of the Israelitish auxiliaries, consequently issued an order for their returning home; but this treatment roused the martial spirit and indignant temper of the Israelites to such a height, that, on their return, they turned their arms against the cities of Judah, and ravaged and destroyed them. The imperfection of the heart of Amaziah was fully displayed on this occasion; for he is related to have brought home the gods of the children of Seir, who were unable to protect their own votaries, and in the folly of his heart to have paid them divine honours. Flushed with the success of his arms in the valley of Salt, he sent a hostile challenge to Jehoahaz king of Israel, expressed in the phraseology of those times, that they should \"look one another in the face. Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.\" In vain the prudent and peaceful spirit of Jehoahaz endeavoured to persuade him from his bold attempt. They saw one another in the face at Bethelhemeth, and Amaziah was made prisoner, and the men of Judah put to flight. Jehoahaz advanced to the capital, carrying the vanquished king along with him; and he entered the city by breaking a large portion of the wall; and, after plundering the temple and the king's\n\nAMATHUS, in Ancient Geography, a town of the tribe of Gad, beyond Jordan; but whether at a greater or less distance from it, is not so easy to determine.

This misfortune seems to have damped the military ardour of Amaziah; for, although he swayed the sceptre over Judah for many years after, yet he never engaged in any hostile contentions with his neighbours. Whether, through the oppressive conduct of Amaziah or whatever cause, it is certain that a conspiracy was formed against him in Jerusalem, which compelled him to fly to the city of Lachish for shelter; but the confederacy was so strong and numerous, that his enemies pursued him thither; and there he fell by their hands, in the 29th year of his reign. (2 Kings xiv. 2 Chron. xxv.)\n\nAMAZONIA, or the country of the American Amazons, is situated between 50 and 70 degrees of west longitude; and between the equator and 15 degrees of south latitude; being bounded on the south by La Plata, on the west by Peru, on the north by the province of Terra Firme, and on the east by Brazil.\n\nWith respect to the Amazons said to have given name to this territory, they have been represented as governed and led to war only by their queen. No men were suffered to live among them; though those of some neighbouring nations were suffered to visit them, at a certain season, for the sake of procreation. The females issuing from this commerce were bred up with care, and instructed in what relates to war and government; as to the males, they were sent away into the country of their fathers. But no such nation is at present to be found, any more than the giants and cannibals mentioned by the first adventurers thither.\n\nAmazonia is generally a flat region, abounding in woods, lakes, rivers, bogs, and marshes. The chief river, and one of the largest in the world, is that called the river of Amazonas, or the Orellana, which is formed by two large rivers, the one rising in the province of Quito, a little south of the equator, in 73 degrees of west longitude, and the other, named Xauxa, rising in the lake of Bourbon, near the Andes, in 10 degrees of south latitude. These two rivers uniting on the confines of Peru and Amazonia, in three degrees odd minutes of south latitude, assume the name of Amazon; whence running eastward upwards of 200 miles, and afterwards inclining to the north, they fall into the Atlantic ocean by 84 channels, which in the rainy season overflow the adjacent country. Besides the two streams mentioned, a multitude of others, both on the north and south side, contribute to the formation of this extraordinary river. As it runs almost across the broadest part of South America, it is computed to be between 4000 and 5000 miles in length, including all its windings. Its channel from Junta de los Reyes, about 60 degrees from its head, to the river Maranon, is from one to two leagues broad; it then widens from three to four, and becomes gradually broader as it approaches the ocean. Between the places last mentioned, its depth is from five to ten fathoms; but from Maranon to Rio Negro it increases to 20 fathoms; after which it is sometimes 30, and sometimes 50 fathoms, or more, till it comes near the end of its course. It has no sand banks, nor does the shore shelter so as to render it dangerous for vessels. The manetu and tortoise abound both upon the banks of this and the other rivers; and the fishermen must be upon their guard against the crocodiles, alligators, and water serpents, which also swarm here.\n\nThe air, as in the countries under the same parallel, is observed to be nearly as cool under the equator as about the tropics, on account of the rains continuing longer, and the sky in that season being clouded. Besides, an easterly wind sets from the Atlantic up the river so strong, that vessels are carried by it against the stream.\n\nThe produce of the country is Indian corn and the cassava root, of which they make flour and bread; tobacco, cotton, sugar, taraparilla, yams, potatoes, and other roots. They have also plenty of venison, fish, and fowl. Among the latter are vast flocks of parrots of all colours, the flesh of which serves for food and the feathers for ornament. All the trees here are evergreens; and fruits, flowers, and herbage, are in perfection all the year round. The principal fruits are cocoa nuts, ananas or pine apples, guavas, bananas, and such others as are usually found between the tropics. The forest and timber trees are cedar, Brazil wood, oak, ebony, logwood; ironwood, so called from its weight and hardness; and several sorts of dying wood.\n\nThe natives are of the common stature, with good features, a copper complexion, black eyes and hair. It is computed that there are of them about 150 different tribes or nations, and the villages are so numerous as to be within call of one another. Among the Homagues, a people near the head of the river, are famous for their cotton manufactures; the Jurines, who live between five and ten degrees of latitude, for their joiners work; and the Wroilares for their earthenware. The Topinambes, who inhabit a large island in the river, are remarkable for their strength. Some of these nations frequently make war upon each other. Their armour consists of darts, javelins, bows and arrows; and they wear targets of cane or fish-skin. They make slaves of their prisoners, whom they otherwise use very well. Every tribe is governed by its respective chief or king, the marks of whose dignity are a crown of parrots' feathers, a chain of lions' teeth or claws hung round his neck, or girt about his waist, and a wooden sword which he carries in his hand.\n\nMost of these nations, except the Homagues, go naked. The women thrust pieces of cane through their ears and under lips, as well as through the skin of the pudenda. At the gristle of their noses they also hang glass beads, which wag to and fro when they speak. They are such skilful marksmen, that they will shoot fish as they swim; and what they catch they eat without either bread or salt. They worship images, which they always carry with them on their expeditions; but they neither have temples nor any order of priests; and permit both polygamy and concubinage.\n\nThe country affords neither gold nor silver mines; only a small quantity of the former is found in the rivulets which fall into the Amazon near its sources in Peru. While the Spaniards imagined that it contained those metals, they made great efforts from Peru to reduce this territory to subjection; till being at length undeceived, they abandoned the design.\n\nAMAZONS, in Antiquity, a nation of female warriors, who founded an empire in Asia Minor, upon the river Thermopylae, along the coasts of the Black Sea.\nThey are said to have formed a state, out of which men were excluded. What commerce they had with that sex, was only with strangers; they killed all their male children; and they cut off the right breasts of their females, to make them more fit for the combat. From which last circumstance it is that they are supposed to take their name, viz. from the privative ο, and μαμάς, mamma, \"breast.\" But Dr Bryant, in his Analysis of Ancient Mythology, explodes this account as fabulous; and observes, that they were in general Cushite colonies from Egypt and Syria, who formed settlements in different countries, and that they derived their name from ζων, \"the sun,\" which was the national object of worship, vol. iii. p. 463. It has indeed been controverted even among ancient writers, whether ever there really was such a nation as that of the Amazons. Strabo, Palaephatus, and others, deny it. On the contrary, Herodotus, Paulianus, Diodorus Siculus, Trogus Pompeius, Justin, Pliny, Mela, Plutarch, &c. expressly assert it.\n\nM. Petit, a French physician, published a Latin dissertation in 1685, to prove that there was really a nation of Amazons. It contains abundance of curious inquiries relating to their habit, their arms, the cities built by them, &c. Others of the moderns also maintain, that their existence is sufficiently proved by the testimony of such of the historians of antiquity as are most worthy of credit; by the monuments which many of them have mentioned; and by medals, some of which are still remaining; and that there is not the least room to believe that what is said of them is fabulous.\n\nThe Amazons are mentioned by the most ancient of the Greek writers. In the third book of the Iliad, Homer represents Priam speaking of himself as having been present, in the earlier part of his life, in a battle with the Amazons; and some of them afterwards came to the assistance of that prince during the siege of Troy.\n\nThe Amazons are particularly mentioned by Herodotus. That historian informs us, that the Grecians fought a battle with the Amazons on the river Thermodoon, and defeated them. After their victory, they carried off all the Amazons they could take alive in three ships. But whilst they were out at sea, these Amazons conspired against the men, and killed them all. Having, however, no knowledge of navigation, nor any skill in the use of the rudder, sails, or oars, they were driven by wind and tide till they arrived at the precipices of the lake Maeotis, in the territories of the Scythians. Here the Amazons went ashore, and, marching into the country, seized and mounted the first horses they met with, and began to plunder the inhabitants. The Scythians at first conceived them to be men; but after they had had skirmishes with them, and taken some prisoners, they discovered them to be women. They were then unwilling to carry on hostilities against them; and by degrees a number of the young Scythians formed connexions with them, and were desirous that these gentle dames should live with them as wives, and be incorporated with the rest of the Scythians. The Amazons agreed to continue their connexion with their Scythian husbands, but refused to associate with the rest of the inhabitants of the country, and especially with the women of it. They afterwards prevailed upon their husbands to retire to Amazons, Sarmatia, where they settled. \"Hence,\" says Herodotus, \"the wives of the Sarmatians still continue their ancient way of living. They hunt on horseback in the company of their husbands, and sometimes alone. They march with their armies, and wear the same dress with the men. The Sarmatians use the Scythian language, but corrupted from the beginning, because the Amazons never learned to speak correctly. Their marriages are attended with this circumstance: no virgin is permitted to marry till she has killed an enemy in the field; so that some always grow old before they can qualify themselves as the law requires.\"\n\nDiodorus Siculus says, \"There was formerly a nation which dwelt near the river Thermodoon, which was subjected to the government of women, and in which the women, like men, managed all the military affairs. Among these female warriors, it is said, was one who excelled the rest in strength and valour. She assembled together an army of women, whom she trained up in military discipline, and subdued some of the neighbouring nations. Afterwards, having by her valour increased her fame, she led her army against the rest; and being successful, she was so puffed up, that she styled herself the daughter of Mars, and ordered the men to spin wool, and do the work of the women within doors. She also made laws, by which the women were enjoined to go to the wars, and the men to be kept at home in a fertile state, and employed in the meanest offices. They also debilitated the arms and thighs of those male children who were born of them, that they might be thereby rendered unfit for war. They feared the right breasts of their girls, that they might be no interruption to them in fighting: whence they derived the name of Amazons. Their queen, having become extremely eminent for skill and knowledge in military affairs, at length built a large city at the mouth of the river Thermodoon, and adorned it with a magnificent palace. In her enterprises she adhered strictly to military discipline and good order; and she added to her empire all the adjoining nations, even to the river Tanais. Having performed these exploits, she at last ended her days like a hero, falling in a battle, in which she had fought courageously. She was succeeded in the kingdom by her daughter, who imitated the valour of her mother, and in some exploits excelled her. She caused the girls from their very infancy to be exercised in hunting, and to be daily trained up in military exercises. She instituted solemn festivals and sacrifices to Mars and Diana, which were named Tauropolis. She afterwards carried her arms beyond the river Tanais, and subdued all the people of those regions, even unto Thrace. Returning then with a great quantity of spoils into her own kingdom, she caused magnificent temples to be erected to the deities before mentioned; and she gained the love of her subjects by her mild and gentle government. She afterwards undertook an expedition against those who were on the other side of the river, and subjected to her dominion a great part of Asia, extending her arms as far as Syria.\"\n\nDiodorus also mentions another race of Amazons who dwelt in Africa; and whom he speaks of as being of greater antiquity than those who lived near the river Thermodoon. \"In the western parts of Libya,\"\nAmazon says he, \"upon the borders of those tracts that are habitable, there was anciently a nation under the government of women, and whose manners and mode of living were altogether different from ours. It was the custom of those women to manage all military affairs; and for a certain time, during which they preserved their virginity, they went out as soldiers into the field. After some years employed in this manner, when the time appointed for this purpose was expired, they associated themselves with men, in order to obtain children. But the magistracy, and all public offices, they kept entirely in their own hands. The men, as the women are with us, were employed in household affairs, submitting themselves wholly to the authority of their wives. They were not permitted to take any part in military affairs, or to have any command, or any public authority, which might have any tendency to encourage them to cast off the yoke of their wives. As soon as any child was born, it was delivered to the father, to be fed with milk, or such other food as was suitable to its age. If females were born, they feared their breasts, that they might not be burdensome to them when they grew up; for they considered them as great hindrances in fighting.\"\n\nJustin represents the Amazonian republic to have taken its rise in Scythia. The Scythians had a great part of Asia under their dominion upwards of 400 years, till they were conquered by Nimus, the founder of the Assyrian empire. After his death, which happened about 1150 years before the Christian era, and that of Semiramis and her son Ninias, Ilmus and Sco-lopites, princes of the royal blood of Scythia, were driven from their country by other princes, who like them aspired to the crown. They departed with their wives, children, and friends; and being followed by a great number of young people of both sexes, they passed into Asiatic Sarmatia, beyond Mount Canaflus, where they formed an establishment, supplying themselves with the riches they wanted, by making incursions into the countries bordering on the Euxine sea. The people of those countries, exasperated by the incursions of their new neighbours, united, surprized, and massacred the men.\n\nThe women then resolving to revenge their death, and at the same time to provide for their own security, resolved to form a new kind of government, to choose a queen, enact laws, and maintain themselves, without men, even against the men themselves. This design was not so very surprising as at first sight appears: for the greatest number of the girls among the Scythians had been inured to the same exercises as the boys; to draw the bow, to throw the javelin, to manage other arms; to riding, hunting, and even the painful labours that seem reserved for men; and many of them, as among the Sarmatians, accompanied the men in war. Hence they had no sooner formed their resolution, than they prepared to execute it, and exercised themselves in all military operations. They soon secured the peaceable possession of the country; and not content with showing their neighbours that all their efforts to drive them thence or subdue them were ineffectual, they made war upon them, and extended their own frontiers. They had hitherto made use of the instructions and assistance of a few men that remained in the country; but finding at length that they could stand their ground, and aggrandize themselves, without them, they killed Amazon, all those whom flight or chance had saved from the fury of the Sarmatians, and for ever renounced marriage, which they now considered as an unfavourable slavery. But as they could only secure the duration of their new kingdom by propagation, they made a law to go every year to the frontiers, to invite the men to come to them; to deliver themselves up to their embraces, without choice on their part, or the least attachment; and to leave them as soon as they were pregnant. All those whom age rendered fit for propagation, and were willing to serve the state by breeding girls, did not go at the same time in search of men; for in order to obtain a right to promote the multiplication of the species, they must first have contributed to its destruction; nor was any thought worthy of giving birth to children till she had killed three men.\n\nIf from this commerce they brought forth girls, they educated them; but with respect to the boys, if we may believe Justin, they strangled them at the moment of their birth; according to Diodorus Siculus, they twisted their legs and arms, so as to render them unfit for military exercises; but Quintus Curtius, Philola-tus, and Jordanus, say, that the less savage sent them to their fathers. It is probable, that at first, when their fury against the men was carried to the greatest height, they killed the boys; that when this fury abated, and most of the mothers were filled with horror at depriving the little creatures of the lives they had just received from them, they fulfilled the first duties of a mother; but, to prevent their causing a revolution in the state, maimed them in such a manner as to render them incapable of war, and employed them in the mean offices which these warlike women thought beneath them. In short, that, when their conquests had confirmed their power, their ferocity subsiding, they entered into political engagements with their neighbours; and the number of the males they had preferred becoming burdensome, they, at the desire of those who rendered them pregnant, sent them the boys, and continued still to keep the girls.\n\nAs soon as the age of the girls permitted, they took away the right breast, that they might draw the bow with the greater force. The common opinion is, that they burnt that breast, by applying to it, at eight years of age, a hot brazen instrument, which infensibly dried up the fibres and glands; some think that they did not make use of so much ceremony, but that when the part was formed they got rid of it by amputation; some again, with much greater probability, affirm, that they employed no violent measures; but, by a continual compression of that part from infancy, prevented its growth, at least so far as to hinder its ever being inconvenient in war.\n\nPlutarch, treating of the Amazons in his life of Theseus, considers the accounts which had been preserved concerning them as partly fabulous and partly true. He gives some account of a battle which had been fought between the Athenians and the Amazons at Athens; and he relates some particulars of this battle which had been recorded by an ancient writer named Clidemus. He says, \"That the left wing of the Amazons moved towards the place which is yet called Amazonium, and the right to a place called Pryx, near Chrysa; upon which the Athenians, issuing from behind\nAmazons, hind the temple of the Muses, fell upon them; and that this is true, the graves of those that were slain, to be seen in the streets that lead to the gate Piraeus, by the temple of the hero Chalcedon, are a sufficient proof. And here it was that the Athenians were routed, and shamefully turned their backs to women, as far as to the temple of the Furies. But fresh supplies coming in from Palladium, Ardettus, and Lyceum, charged their right wing, and beat them back into their very tents; in which action a great number of the Amazons were slain.\" In another place he says, \"It appears that the passage of the Amazons through Thessaly was not without opposition; for there are yet to be seen many of their sepulchres near Scutellaea and Cyanecephale.\" And in his life of Pompey, speaking of the Amazons, Plutarch says, \"They inhabit those parts of Mount Caucasus that look towards the Hyrcanian sea (not bordering upon the Albanians, for the territories of the Getae and the Lyciae lie betwixt): and with these people do they yearly, for two months only, accompany and cohabit, bed and board, near the river Thermoodoon. After that they retire to their own habitations, and live alone all the rest of the year.\"\n\nQuintus Curtius says, \"The nation of the Amazons is situated upon the borders of Hyrcania, inhabiting the plains of Thermiscyra, near the river Thermoodoon. Their queen was named Thalestris, and she had under her subjection all the country that lies between Mount Caucasus and the river Phasis. This queen came out of her dominions, in consequence of an ardent desire she had conceived to see Alexander; and being advanced near the place where he was, she previously sent messengers to acquaint him, that the queen was come to have the satisfaction of seeing and conversing with him. Having obtained permission to visit him, she advanced with 300 of her Amazons, leaving the rest of her troops behind. As soon as she came within sight of the king, she leaped from her horse, holding two javelins in her right hand. The apparel of the Amazons does not cover all the body, for their left side is naked down to the stomack; nor do the skirts of their garments, which they tie up in a knot, reach below their knees. They preserve their left breast entire, that they may be able to suckle their female offspring; and they cut off and fear their right, that they may draw their bows, and cast their darts, with the greater ease. Thalestris looked at the king with an undaunted countenance, and narrowly examined his person; which did not according to her ideas, come up to the fame of his great exploits: For the barbarians have a great veneration for a majestic person, esteeming those only to be capable of performing great actions on whom nature has conferred a dignified appearance. The king having asked her whether she had any thing to desire of him, she replied, without scruple or hesitation, that she was come with a view to have children by him, the being worthy to bring him heirs to his dominions. Their offspring, if of the female sex, she would retain herself; and if of the male sex, it should be delivered to Alexander. He then asked her, whether she would accompany him in his wars? But this she declined, alleging, That she had left nobody to take care of her kingdom. She continued to solicit Alexander, that he would not send her back without conforming to her wishes; but it was not till after a delay of 13 days that he complied. She then returned to her own kingdom.\"\n\nJustin also repeatedly mentions this visit of Thalestris to Alexander; and in one place he says, that the made a march of 25 days, in order to obtain this meeting with him. The interview between Alexander and Thalestris is likewise mentioned by Diodorus Siculus. The learned Goropius, as he is quoted by Dr Petit, laments, in very pathetic terms, the hard fate of Thalestris, who was obliged to travel so many miles, and to encounter many hardships, in order to procure this interview with the Macedonian prince; and, from the circumstances, is led to consider the whole account as incredible. But Dr Petit, with equal erudition, with equal eloquence, and with superior force of reasoning, at length determines, that her journey was not founded upon irrational principles, and that full credit is due to those grave and venerable historians by whom this transaction has been recorded.\n\nThe Amazons are represented as being armed with bows and arrows, with javelins, and also with an axe of a particular construction, which was denominated the axe of the Amazons. According to the elder Pliny, this axe was invented by Pentheilea, one of their queens. On many ancient medals are representations of the Amazons, armed with these axes. They are also said to have had bucklers in the shape of a half moon.\n\nThe Amazons are mentioned by many other ancient authors, besides those which have been enumerated; and if any credit be due to the accounts concerning them, they subsisted through several ages. They are represented as having rendered themselves extremely formidable; as having founded cities, enlarged the boundaries of their dominions, and conquered several other nations.\n\nThat at any period there should have been women, who, without the assistance of men, built cities and governed them, raised armies and commanded them, administered public affairs, and extended their dominion by arms, is undoubtedly so contrary to all that we have seen and known of human affairs, as to appear in a very great degree incredible; but that women may have existed sufficiently robust, and sufficiently courageous, to have engaged in warlike enterprises, and even to have been successful in them, is certainly not impossible, however contrary to the usual course of things. In support of this side of the question, it may be urged, that women who have been early trained to warlike exercises, to hunting, and to a hard and laborious mode of living, may be rendered more strong, and capable of more vigorous exertions, than men who have led indolent, delicate, and luxurious lives, and who have seldom been exposed even to the inclemencies of the weather. The limbs of women, as well as of men, are strengthened and rendered more robust by frequent and laborious exercise. A nation of women, therefore, brought up and disciplined as the ancient Amazons are represented to have been, would be superior to an equal number of effeminate men, though they might be much inferior to an equal number of hardy men, trained up and disciplined in the same manner.\n\nThat much of what is said of the Amazons is fabulous, there can be no reasonable doubt; but it does not\nAmazons therefore follow, that the whole is without foundation.\n\nThe ancient medals and monuments on which they are represented are very numerous, as are also the testimonies of ancient writers. It seems not rational to suppose that all this originated in fiction, though it may be much blended with it. The Abbé Guyon speaks of the history of the Amazons as having been regarded by many persons as fabulous, \"rather from prejudice than from any real and solid examination,\" and it must be acknowledged, that the arguments in favour of their existence, from ancient history, and from ancient monuments, are extremely powerful. The fact seems to be, that truth and fiction have been blended in the narrations concerning these ancient heroines.\n\nInstances of heroism in women have occasionally occurred in modern times, somewhat resembling that of the ancient Amazons. The times and the manners of chivalry, in particular, by bringing great enterprises, bold adventurers, and extravagant heroism, into fashion, inspired the women with the same taste. The women, in consequence of the prevailing passion, were now seen in the middle of camps and of armies. They quitted the soft and tender inclinations, and the delicate offices of their own sex, for the toils and the toilsome occupations of ours. During the crusades, animated by the double enthusiasm of religion and of valour, they often performed the most romantic exploits; obtained indulgencies on the field of battle, and died with arms in their hands, by the side of their lovers or of their husbands.\n\nIn Europe, the women attacked and defended fortifications; princesses commanded their armies, and obtained victories. Such was the celebrated Joan de Montfort, disputing for her duchy of Bretagne, and fighting herself. Such was that still more celebrated Margaret of Anjou, that active and intrepid general and soldier, whose genius supported a long time a feeble husband; which taught him to conquer; which replaced him upon the throne; which twice relieved him from prison; and, opprested by fortune and by rebels, which did not bend till after she had decided in person twelve battles.\n\nThe warlike spirit among the women, consistent with ages of barbarism, when every thing is impetuous because nothing is fixed, and when all excess is the excess of force, continued in Europe upwards of 400 years, showing itself from time to time, and always in the middle of convulsions, or on the eve of great revolutions. But there were eras and countries in which that spirit appeared with particular lustre. Such were the displays it made in the 15th and 16th centuries in Hungary, and in the islands of the Archipelago and the Mediterranean, when they were invaded by the Turks.\n\nAmong the striking instances of Amazonian conduct in modern ladies, may be mentioned that of Jane of Belleville, widow of Monf. de Clisson, who was beheaded at Paris in the year 1343, on a suspicion of carrying on a correspondence with England and the count de Montfort. This lady, filled with grief for the death of her late husband, and exasperated at the ill treatment which she considered him as having received, sent off \"her son secretly to London;\" and when her apprehensions were removed with respect to him, she sold her jewels, fitted out three ships, and put to sea, to revenge the death of her husband upon all the French Amazons, with whom she should meet. This new corsair made several descents upon Normandy, where the stormed castles; and the inhabitants of that province were spectators more than once, whilst their villages were all in a blaze, of one of the finest women in Europe, with a sword in one hand and a torch in the other, urging the carnage, and crying with pleasure all the horrors of war.\"\n\nWe read in Mezeray (under the article of the Croisade, preached by St Bernard in the year 1147), \"That many women did not content themselves with taking the cross, but that they also took up arms to defend it, and composed squadrons of females, which rendered credible all that has been said of the prowess of the Amazons.\"\n\nIn the year 1590, the League party obtained some troops from the king of Spain. Upon the news of their being disembarked, Barri de St Aunez, Henry IV.'s governor at Leucate, set out to communicate a scheme to the duke de Montmorenci, commander in that province. He was taken in his way by some of the troops of the League, who were also upon their march with the Spaniards towards Leucate. They were persuaded, that by thus having the governor in their hands, the gates of that place would be immediately opened to them, or at least would not hold out long. But Conflantia de Cecelli, his wife, after having assembled the garrison, put herself so resolutely at their head, pike in hand, that she inspired the weakest with courage; and the besiegers were repulsed wherever they presented themselves. Shame, and their great loss, having rendered them desperate, they sent a messenger to this courageous woman, acquainting her, that if she continued to defend herself, they would hang her husband. She replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I have riches in abundance: I have offered them, and I do still offer them, for his ransom; but I would not ignominiously purchase a life which he would reproach me with, and which he would be ashamed to enjoy. I will not dishonour him by treason against my king and country.\" The besiegers having made a fresh attack without success, put her husband to death, and raised the siege. Henry IV. afterwards sent to this lady the brevet of governess of Leucate, with the reverence for her son.\n\nThe famous maid of Orleans, also, is an example known to every reader.\n\nThe Abbé Arnaud, in his memoirs, speaks of a countess of St Balmont, who used to take the field with her husband, and fight by his side. She sent several Spanish prisoners of her taking to Marshal Feuquieres; and, what was not a little extraordinary, this Amazon at home was all affability and sweetness, and gave herself up to reading and acts of piety.\n\nDr Johnson seems to have given some credit to the accounts which have been transmitted down to us concerning the ancient Amazons; and he has endeavoured to show, that we ought not hastily to reject ancient historical narrations because they contain facts repugnant to modern manners, and exhibit scenes to which nothing now occurring bears a resemblance. \"Of what we know not (says he) we can only judge by what we know. Every novelty appears more wonderful, as it is more remote from anything with which experience...\"\nexperience or testimony have hitherto acquainted us; and, if it passes farther, beyond the notions that we have been accustomed to form, it becomes at last incredible. We seldom consider that human knowledge is very narrow; that national manners are formed by chance; that uncommon conjunctures of causes produce rare effects; or, that what is impossible at one time or place may yet happen in another. It is always easier to deny than to inquire. To refuse credit confers for a moment an appearance of superiority which every little mind is tempted to assume, when it may be gained so cheaply as by withdrawing attention from evidence, and declining the fatigue of comparing probabilities. Many relations of travellers have been slighted as fabulous, till more frequent voyages have confirmed their veracity; and it may reasonably be imagined that many ancient historians are unjustly suspected of falsehood, because our own times afford nothing that resembles what they tell. Few narratives will, either to men or women appear more incredible than the histories of the Amazons; of female nations, of whose constitution it was the essential and fundamental law, to exclude men from all participation, either of public affairs or domestic business; where female armies marched under female captains, female farmers gathered the harvest, female partners danced together, and female wits diverted one another. Yet several ages of antiquity have transmitted accounts of the Amazons of Caucasus; and of the Amazons of America, who have given their name to the greatest river in the world, Condamine lately found such memorials as can be expected among erratic and unlettered nations, where events are recorded only by tradition, and new swarms settling in the country from time to time confuse and efface all traces of former times.\n\nNo author has taken so much pains upon this subject as Dr Petit. But, in the course of his work, he has given it as his opinion, that there is great difficulty in governing the women even at present, though they are unarmed and unpractised in the art of war. After all his elaborate inquiries and discussions, therefore, this learned writer might probably think, that it is not an evil of the first magnitude that the race of Amazons now ceases to exist.\n\nRousseau says, \"The empire of the woman is an empire of softness, of address, of complacency. Her commands are carelessly, her menaces are tears.\" But the empire of the Amazons was certainly an empire of a very different kind. Upon the whole, we may conclude with Dr Johnson: \"The character of the ancient Amazons was rather terrible than lovely. The hand could not be very delicate that was only employed in drawing the bow, and brandishing the battleaxe. Their power was maintained by cruelty, their courage was deformed by ferocity; and their example only shows, that men and women live best together.\"\n\n**AMAZONS**, the river of, in America. See **AMAZONIA**.\n\n**AMAZONIAN Habit**, in Antiquity, denotes a dress formed in imitation of the Amazons. Marcia the famous concubine of the emperor Commodus, had the appellation of Amazonian, because she charmed him most in a habit of this kind. Hence also that prince himself engaged in combat in the amphitheatre in an Amazonian habit; and of all titles the Amazonius was one of those he most delighted in. In honour either of the gallant or his mistress, the month December was also denominated Amazonius. Some also apply Amazonian habit to the hunting-dresses worn by many ladies among us.\n\n**AMBA**, an Abyssinian or Ethiopic word, signifying a rock. The Abyssinians give names to each of their rocks, as Amba-Dorbo, the rock of a hen, &c. Some of these rocks are said to have the name of Aorni; and are of such a stupendous height, that the Alps and Pyrenees are but low hills in comparison of them. Amongst the mountains, and even frequently in the plains, of this country, arise steep and craggy rocks of various forms, some resembling towers, others pyramids, &c., so perpendicular and smooth on the sides, that they seem to be works of art; infomuch, that men, cattle, &c. are craned up by the help of ladders and ropes; and yet the tops of these rocks are covered with woods, meadows, fountains, fish-ponds, &c. which very copiously supply the animals feasted thereon with all the conveniences of life. The most remarkable of these rocks is called Amba-Geflen. It is prodigiously steep, in the form of a castle built of freestone, and almost impregnable. Its summit is about half a Portuguese league in breadth, and the circumference at the bottom about half a day's journey. The ascent at first is easy; but grows afterwards so steep, that the Abafla-oxen, which will otherwise clamber like goats, must be craned up, and let down with ropes. Here the princes of the blood were formerly confined, in low cottages amongst shrubs and wild cedars, with an allowance barely sufficient to keep them alive. There is, according to Kircher, in this country, a rock so curiously hollowed by nature, that at a distance it resembles a looking-glass; and opposite to this another, on the top of which nothing can be so softly whispered but it may be heard a great way off. Between many of these rocks and mountains are vast abysses, which appear very dreadful to the eye.\n\n**AMBACHT**, is a word which denotes a kind of jurisdiction or territory, the possessor whereof has the administration of justice, both in alto and bajo; or of what is called, in the Scots law, a power of pit and gallows, i.e. a power of drowning and hanging. In some ancient writers, ambacht is particularly used for the jurisdiction, government, or chief magistracy of a city. The word is very ancient, though used originally in a sense somewhat different. Ennius calls a mercenary, or slave hired for money, ambatus; and Cæsar gives the same appellation to a kind of dependents among the Gauls, who, without being slaves, were attached to the service of great lords.\n\n**AMBAGES**. See **CIRCUMLOCUTION**.\n\n**AMBARVALIA**, in Antiquity, a ceremony among the Romans, when, in order to procure from the gods a happy harvest, they conducted the victims thrice round the corn fields in procession, before sacrificing them.—Ambarvalia were either of a private or public nature: the private were performed by the master of a family, and the public by the priests who officiated at the solemnity, called fratres ovales. The prayer preferred on this occasion, the formula of which we have in Cato de Re Rustica, cap. cxlii. was called carmen ambervale. At these feasts they sacrificed to Ceres a sow, a sheep, and a bull or heifer, whence they took\nAMBASSADOR, or Embassador, a public minister sent from one sovereign prince, as a representative of his person, to another.\n\nAmbassadors are either ordinary or extraordinary. Ambassadors in ordinary, is he who constantly resides in the court of another prince, to maintain a good understanding, and look to the interest of his master. Till about two hundred years ago, ambassadors in ordinary were not heard of; all, till then, were ambassadors extraordinary; that is, such as are sent on some particular occasion, and who retire as soon as the affair is dispatched.\n\nBy the law of nations, none under the quality of a sovereign prince can send or receive an ambassador. At Athens, ambassadors mounted the pulpit of the public orators, and there opened their commissions, acquainting the people with their errand. At Rome, they were introduced to the senate, and delivered their commissions to the fathers.\n\nAmbassadors should never attend any public solemnities, as marriages, funerals, &c. unless their matters have some interest therein; nor must they go into mourning on any occasions of their own, because they represent the person of their prince. By the civil law, the moveable goods of an ambassador, which are accounted an accession to his person, cannot be seized on, neither as a pledge, nor for payment of a debt, nor by order or execution of judgment, nor by the king's or state's leave where he resides, as some conceive; for all actions ought to be far from an ambassador, as well that which toucheth his necessities, as his person: if therefore, he hath contracted any debt, he is to be called upon kindly; and if he refuses, then letters of request are to go to his master. Nor can any of the ambassador's domestic servants that are registered in the secretaries of state's office be arrested in person or goods; if they are, the process shall be void, and the parties suing out and executing it shall suffer and be liable to such penalties and corporal punishment as the lord chancellor or either of the chief justices shall think fit to inflict. Yet ambassadors cannot be defended when they commit anything against that state, or the person of the prince, with whom they reside; and if they are guilty of treason, felony, &c. or any other crime against the law of nations, they lose the privilege of an ambassador, and may be subject to punishment as private aliens.\n\nAMBER, in Surgery, the name of an instrument for reducing dislocated bones. In Anatomy, a term for the superficial jutting out of a bone.\n\nAMBER (Sucinum), in Natural History, a solid, hard, semipellucid, bituminous substance of a particular nature, of use in medicine and in several of the arts. It has been called ambra by the Arabians, and eleostrum by the Greeks.\n\nAmber has been of great repute in the world from the earliest times. Many years before Christ it was in esteem as a medicine; and Plato, Aristotle, Herodotus, Aeschylus, and others, have commended its virtues. In the times of the Romans, it became in high esteem as a gem; and in the luxurious reign of Nero, immense quantities of it were brought to Rome, and used for ornamenting works of various kinds.\n\nThe most remarkable property of this substance is, that when rubbed it draws or attracts other bodies to it; and, this, it is observed, it does even to those substances which the ancients thought it had an antipathy to; as oily bodies, drops of water, human sweat, &c. Add, that, by the friction it is brought to yield light pretty copiously in the dark; whence it is reckoned among the native phosphors.\n\nThe property which amber possesses of attracting light bodies was very anciently observed. Thales of Miletus, 600 years before Christ, concluded from hence, that it was animated. But the first person who expressly mentions this substance is Theophrastus, about the year 300 before Christ. The attractive property of amber is likewise occasionally taken notice of by Pliny and other later naturalists, particularly by Gellius, Kemelm Digby, and Sir Thomas Brown; but it was generally apprehended that this quality was peculiar to amber and jet, and perhaps agate, till Gilbert published his treatise de Magnete, in the year 1600. From ἀμβρόσια, the Greek name for amber, is derived the term Electricity, which is now very extensively applied, not only to the power of attracting light bodies inherent in amber, but to other similar powers, and their various effects in whatever bodies they reside, or to whatever bodies they may be communicated.\n\nAmber assumes all figures in the ground; that of a pear, an almond, a pea, &c. In amber there have been found to be letters found very well formed; and even Hebrew and Arabic characters.—Within some pieces, leaves, insects, &c. have likewise been found included; which seems to indicate either that the amber was originally in a fluid state, or that having been exposed to the sun it was once softened, and rendered susceptible of the leaves, insects, &c. which came in its way. The latter of these suppositions seems the more agreeable to the phenomenon; because those insects, &c. are never found in the centre of the pieces of amber, but always near the surface. It is observed by the inhabitants of those places where amber is produced, that all animals, whether terrestrial, aerial, or aquatic, are extremely fond of it, and that pieces of it are frequently found in their excrements. The bodies of insects, found buried in amber, are viewed with admiration by all the world; but of the most remarkable of these, many are to be suspected as counterfeit, the great price at which beautiful specimens of this kind fell, having tempted ingenious cheats to introduce animal bodies in such artful manners, into seemingly whole pieces of amber, that it is not easy to detect the fraud.\n\nOf those insects which have been originally enclosed in amber, some are plainly seen to have struggled hard for their liberty, and even to have left their limbs behind them in the attempt; it being no unusual thing to see, in a mass of amber that contains a stout beetle, the animal wanting one, or perhaps two of its legs; and those legs left in different places, nearer that part of the mass from which it has travelled. This also may account for the common accident of finding legs or\nor wings of flies, without the rest of their bodies, in pieces of amber; the insects having, when entangled in the yet soft and viscid matter, escaped, at the expense of leaving those limbs behind them. Drops of clear water are sometimes also preserved into it while soft, and preserved by its hardening round them. Beautiful leaves of a pinnated structure, resembling some of the ferns, or maidenhairs, have been found in some pieces; but these are rare, and the specimens of great value. Mineral substances are also found at times lodged in masses of amber. Some of the pompous collections of the German princes boast of specimens of native gold and silver in masses of amber; but as there are many substances of the marcasite, and other kinds, that have all the glittering appearance of gold and silver, it is not to be too hastily concluded, that these metals are really lodged in these beds of amber. Iron is found in various shapes immersed in amber; and as it is often seen eroded, and sometimes in the state of vitriol, it is not impossible but that copper, and the other metals, may be also sometimes immersed in it in the same state; hence the bluish and greenish colours, frequently found in the recent pieces of amber, may be owing, like the particles of the gem colours, to these metals; but as the gems, by their dense texture, always retain their colours, this lighter and more lax bitumen usually loses what it gets of this kind by keeping some time. Small pebbles, grains of sand, and fragments of other stones, are also not unfrequently found immersed in amber.\n\nNaturalists have been greatly divided as to the origin of this substance, and what class of bodies it belongs to; some referring it to the vegetable, others to the mineral, and some even to the animal kingdom. Pliny describes it as \"a resinous juice, oozing from aged pines and firs (others say from poplars, whereof there are whole forests on the coasts of Sweden), and discharged thence into the sea, where undergoing some alteration, it is thrown, in this form, upon the shores of Prussia, which lie very low: he adds, that it was hence the ancients gave it the denomination succinum; from succus, juice.\n\nSome suppose amber a compound substance. Prussia, say they, and the other countries which produce amber, are moistened with a bituminous juice, which mixing with the vitriolic salts abounding in those places, the points of these salts fix its fluidity, whence it congeals; and the result of that congelation makes what we call amber; which is more or less pure, transparent, and firm, as these parts of salt and bitumen are more or less pure, and are mixed in this or that proportion.\n\nMr Brydone, in his tour to Sicily and Malta, says, that the river Gearetta, formerly celebrated by the poets under the name of Simetus, throws up near its mouth great quantities of amber. He mentions also a kind of artificial amber, not uncommon there, made, as he was told, from copal, but very different from the natural.\n\nAccording to Hartman, amber is formed of a bitumen, mixed with vitriol and other salts. But though this were allowed him in regard to the fossil amber, many dispute whether the sea amber be so produced. It is, however, apparent, that all amber is of the same origin, and probably that which is found in the sea has been washed thither out of the cliffs; though Hartman thinks it very possible, that some of it may be formed in the earth under the sea, and be washed up thence. The sea amber is usually finer to the eye than the fossil; but the reason is, that it is deprived of that coarse coat with which the other is covered while in the earth.\n\nUpon the whole, it seems generally agreed upon, that amber is a true bitumen of a fossil origin. In a late volume of the Journal de Physique, however, we find it affected by Dr Girtanner to be an animal product, a sort of honey or wax formed by a species of large ant called by Linnaeus formica rufa. These ants, our author informs us, inhabit the old pine forests, where they sometimes form hills about six feet in diameter: and it is generally in these ancient forests, or in places where they have been, that fossil amber is found. This substance is not hard as that which is taken up in the sea at Prussia, and which is well known to naturalists. It has the consistence of honey or of half melted wax, but it is of a yellow colour like common amber; it gives the same product by chemical analysis, and it hardens like the other when it is suffered to remain some time in a solution of common salt. This accounts for the insects that are so often found inclosed in it. Among these insects ants are always the most prevailing; which tends farther, Mr Girtanner thinks, to the confirmation of his hypothesis. Amber, then, in his opinion, is nothing but a vegetable oil rendered concrete by the acid of ants, just as wax is nothing but an oil hardened by the acid of bees; a fact incontrovertibly proved, we are told, since Mr Metherie has been able to make artificial wax by mixing oil of olives with the nitrous acid, and which wax is not to be distinguished from the natural.\n\nThere are several indications which discover where amber is to be found. The surface of the earth is there covered with a soft scaly stone; and vitriol in particular always abounds there, which is sometimes found white, sometimes reduced into a matter like melted glass, and sometimes figured like petrified wood.\n\nAmber of the finest kind has been found in England. It is frequently thrown on the shores of Yorkshire, and many other places, and found even in our clay pits; the pits dug for tile-clay between Tyburn and Kennington gravel pits, and that behind St George's Hospital at Hyde-park corner, have afforded fine specimens.\n\nPoland, Silesia, and Bohemia, are famous for the amber dug up there at this time. Germany affords great quantities of amber, as well dug up from the bowels of the earth, as toiled about on the shores of the sea and rivers there. Saxony, Meissen, Sweden, and many other places in this tract of Europe, abound with it. Denmark has afforded, at different times, several quantities of fossil amber; and the shores of the Baltic abound with it. But the countries lying on the Baltic afford it in the greatest abundance of all; and of these the most plentiful country is Prussia, and the next is Pomerania. Prussia was, as early as the time of Theodoric the Goth, famous for amber; for this substance coming into great repute with this prince, some natives of Prussia, who were about his court, offered their service to go to their own country, where\nthat substance, they said, was produced, and bring back great stores of it. They accordingly did so; and from this time Prussia had the honour to be called the country of amber, instead of Italy, which had before undeservedly that title. This article alone brings his Prussian majesty a revenue of $26,000 dollars annually. The amber of Prussia is not only found on the sea coasts, but in digging; and though that of Pomerania is generally brought from the shores, yet people who dig, on different occasions, in the very heart of the country, at times find amber.\n\nJunker describes, after Neumann, the Prussian amber mines, which are the richest known. First, At the surface of the earth is found a stratum of sand. Immediately under this sand is a bed of clay, filled with small flints of about an inch diameter each. Under this clay lies a stratum of black earth or turf, filled with fossil wood, half decomposed and bituminous; this stratum is extended upon a bank of minerals, containing little metal except iron, which are consequently pyrites. Lastly, Under this bed the amber is found scattered about in pieces, or sometimes accumulated in heaps.\n\nAmber has a subacid resinous taste, and fragrant aromatic smell, especially when distilled. It differs from the other bituminous substances in this, that it yields by distillation a volatile acid salt, which none of the others do; otherwise it affords the same sort of principles as them, viz. an acid phlegm, an oil which gradually becomes thicker as the distillation is continued; and when the operation is finished, there remains a black caput mortuum in the retort. When boiled in water, it neither softens nor undergoes any sensible alteration. Exposed to the fire in an open vessel, it melts into a black mass very like a bitumen: It is partly soluble in spirit of wine, and likewise in some essential oils; but it is with difficulty that the expressed ones are brought to act upon it. The stronger sorts of fixed alkaline lixivias almost totally dissolve it.\n\nThis substance is principally of two colours, white and yellow. The white is the most esteemed for medicinal purposes, as being the most odoriferous, and containing the greatest quantity of volatile salt; though the yellow is most valued by those who manufacture beads and other toys with it, by reason of its transparency.\n\nAmber is the basis of all varnishes, by solution in the ways described under the article Varnish.\n\nAmber, when it has once been melted, irrecoverably loses its beauty and hardness. There have been some, however, who pretended they had an art of melting some small pieces of amber into a mass, and constituting large ones of them: but this seems such another undertaking as the making of gold; all the trials that have yet been made by the most curious experimenters, proving, that the heat which is necessary to melt amber is sufficient to destroy it.

No 248. p. 25.)\n\nCould amber indeed be distilled without impairing its transparency, or one large mass be made of it by uniting several small ones, it is easy to see what would be the advantages of such a process. The art of embalming might possibly be also carried to a great height by this, if we could preserve the human corpse in a transparent case of amber, as the bodies of flies, spiders, grasshoppers, &c. are to a great perfection.\n\nSomething of a substitute of this kind we have in fine rosin; which being distilled by heat, and the bodies of Ambertigris, small animals several times dipped in it, they are thus coated with colophony, that in some degree resembles amber; but this must be kept from dust.\n\nAmber in substance has been much recommended as a nervous and cordial medicine; and alleged to be very efficacious in promoting the menstrual discharge, and the exclusion of the foetus and secundines in labour: but as in its crude state it is quite insoluble by our juices, it certainly can have very little effect on the animal system, and therefore it is now seldom given in substance.

The spot is marked by a flat stone.\n\nAMBERGRIS, AMBERGREASE, or GREY-AMBER, in Natural History, is a solid, opaque, ash-coloured, fatty, inflammable substance, variegated like marble, remarkably light, rugged, and uneven in its surface, and has a fragrant odour when heated. It does not effervescence with acids: it melts freely over the fire into a kind of yellow rosin; and is hardly soluble in spirit of wine.\n\nIt is found swimming upon the sea, or the sea coast, or in the sand near the sea coast; especially in the Atlantic ocean, on the sea coast of Brazil, and that of Madagascar; on the coast of Africa, of the East Indies, China, Japan, and the Molucca islands: but most of the ambergris which is brought to England comes from the Bahama islands, from Providence, &c. where it is found on the coast. It is also sometimes found in the abdomen of whales by the whale fisherman, always in lumps of various shapes and sizes, weighing from half an ounce to an hundred and more pounds. The piece which the Dutch East India Company bought from the king of Tydore, weighed 182 pounds. An American fisherman from Antigua found some years ago, about fifty-two leagues south-east from the Windward islands, a piece of ambergris in a whale which weighed about a hundred and thirty pounds, and sold for 500l. sterling.\n\nThere have been many different opinions concerning the origin of this substance.\n\nIt has been supposed to be a fossil bitumen or naphtha, exuding out of the bowels of the earth in a fluid form, and diffusing into the sea, where it hardens and floats on the surface. But having been frequently found in the bellies of whales, it has by others been considered as entirely an animal production.\n\nClusius asserted it to be a phlegmatic secretion, or indurated\nAmbergris, indurated indigestible part of the food, collected and found in the stomach of the whale, in the same manner as the Bezoars are found in the stomachs of other animals.\n\nIn an account communicated by Paul Dudley, Esq., in the 23rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, the ambergris found in whales is represented as a kind of animal product, like musk, and cafforeum, &c., secreted and collected in a particular bag or bladder, which is furnished with an excretory duct or canal, the spout of which runs tapering into and through the length of the penis; and that this bag, which lies just over the testicles, is almost full of a deep orange-colored liquor, not quite so thick as oil, of the same smell as the balls of ambergris, which float and swim loofe in it; which colour and liquor may also be found in the canal of the penis; and that therefore ambergris is never to be found in any female, but in the male only. But these circumstances are not only destitute of truth, but also contrary to the laws of the animal economy: For, in the first place, ambergris is frequently found in females as well as males; although that found in females is never in such large pieces, nor of so good a quality, as what is found in males. Secondly, No person who has the least knowledge in anatomy or physiology, will ever believe that organized bodies, such as the beaks of the sepia, which are constantly found in ambergris taken out of the whale, can have been absorbed from the intestines by the lacteals or lymphatics, and collected with the ambergris in the precluded bag above mentioned.\n\nKämpfer, who has given us so many other faithful accounts in natural history, seems to come nearer the truth with regard to the origin of ambergris, when he says, that it is the dung of the whale; and that the Japanese for this reason call it kufira no fuu, i.e. whale's dung. This account, however, though founded on observation, has never obtained credit; but has been considered rather as a fabulous story, with which the Japanese imposed upon him, who had himself no direct observation to prove the fact.\n\nThis matter, therefore, remained a subject of great doubt; and it was generally thought to be more probable, that ambergris, after having been swallowed and somehow or other changed in the stomach and bowels of the whale, was found among its excrements.\n\nBut the most satisfactory account of the real origin of ambergris, is that given by Dr Swedlaur in the 73rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, art. 15.\n\nWe are told by all writers on ambergris, that sometimes claws and beaks of birds, feathers of birds, parts of vegetables, shells, fish, and bones of fish, are found in the middle of it, or variously mixed with it. Of a very large quantity of pieces, however, which the Doctor examined, he found none that contained any such thing; though he allows that such substances may sometimes be found in it: but in all the pieces of any considerable size, whether found on the sea or in the whale, he constantly found a considerable quantity of black spots, which, after the most careful examination, appeared to be the beaks of the Sepia Ophiodon; and these beaks, he thinks, might be the substances which have hitherto been always mistaken for claws or beaks of birds, or for shells.\n\nThe presence of these beaks in ambergris proves evi-\n\nVol. I. Part II.\nAmbregris hook a whale of this description, torpid, sickly, emaciated, or one that does not dung on being hooked, they immediately either cut up the above-mentioned protuberance, if there be any, or they rip open its bowels from the orifice of the anus, and find the ambergris sometimes in one sometimes in different lumps, of generally from three to twelve and more inches in diameter, and from one pound to twenty or thirty pounds in weight, at the distance of two, but most frequently of about six or seven feet from the anus, and never higher up in the intestinal canal; which, according to their description, is in all probability the intestinum cæcum, hitherto mistaken for a peculiar bag made by nature for the secretion and collection of this singular substance. That the part they cut open to come at the ambergris is no other than the intestinal canal is certain, because they constantly begin their incision at the anus, and find the cavity everywhere filled with the faeces of the whale, which from their colour and smell it is impossible for them to mistake. The ambergris found in the intestinal canal is not so hard as that which is found on the sea or sea coast, but soon grows hard in the air: when first taken out it has nearly the same colour, and the same disagreeable smell, though not so strong, as the more liquid dung of the whale has; but on exposing it to the air, it by degrees not only grows grayish, and its surface is covered with a grayish dust like old chocolate, but it also loses its disagreeable smell, and, when kept for a certain length of time, acquires the peculiar odour which is so agreeable to most people.\n\nThe gentlemen the Doctor conversed with confessed, that if they knew not from experience that ambergris thus found will in time acquire the above-mentioned qualities, they would by no means be able to distinguish ambergris from hard indurated faeces. This is so true, that whenever a whale voids its faeces upon being hooked, they look carefully to see if they cannot discover among the more liquid excrements (of which the whale discharges several barrels) some pieces floating on the sea, of a more compact substance than the rest. These they take up and wash, knowing them to be ambergris.\n\nIn considering whether there be any material difference between the ambergris found upon the sea or sea coast, and that found in the bowels or among the dung of the whale, the Doctor refutes the opinion, that all ambergris found in whales is of an inferior quality, and therefore much less in price. Ambergris, he observes, is only valued for its purity, lightness, compactness, colour, and smell. There are pieces of ambergris found on different coasts, which are of a very inferior quality; whereas there are often found in whales pieces of it of the first value; nay, several pieces found in the same whale, according to the above-mentioned qualities, are more or less valuable. All ambergris found in whales has at first, when taken out of the intestines, very near the same smell as the liquid excrements of that animal have; it has then also nearly the same blackish colour: they find it in the whale sometimes quite hard, sometimes rather softish, but never so liquid as the natural faeces of that animal. And it is a matter of fact, that after being taken out and kept in the air, all ambergris grows not only harder and whiter, but also loses by degrees its smell, and attains such an agreeable one, as that in general has which is found swimming upon the sea; therefore the goodness of ambergris seems rather to depend on its age. By being accumulated after a certain length of time in the intestinal canal, it seems even then to become of a whiter colour, and less ponderous, and to acquire its agreeable smell. The only reason why ambergris found floating on the sea generally possesses the above-mentioned qualities in a superior degree, is because it is commonly older, and has been longer exposed to the air. It is more frequently found in males than females; the pieces found in females are in general smaller, and those found in males seem constantly to be larger and of a better quality; and therefore the high price in proportion to the size is not merely imaginary, but the rarity's sake, but in some respects well founded, because such large pieces appear to be of a greater age and possess the above-mentioned qualities in general in a higher degree of perfection than smaller pieces.\n\nIt is known, that the sepia octopodia, or cuttle-fish, is the constant and natural food of the spermaceti whale, or phyceter macrocephalus. Of this the fishermen are so well persuaded, that whenever they discover any recent relics of it swimming on the sea, they conclude that a whale of this kind is, or has been, in that part. Another circumstance which corroborates the fact is, that the spermaceti whale on being hooked generally vomits up some remains of the sepia. Hence it is easy to account for the many beaks, or pieces of beaks, of the sepia found in all ambergris. The beak of the sepia is a black horny substance, and therefore passes undigested through the stomach into the intestinal canal, where it is mixed with the faeces; after which it is either evacuated with them, or if these latter be preternaturally retained, forms concretions with them, which render the animal sick and torpid, and produce an obilatation, which ends either in an abscess of the abdomen, as has been frequently observed, or becomes fatal to the animal; whence, in both the cases, on the bursting of its belly, that hardened substance known under the name of ambergris, is found swimming on the sea or thrown upon the coast.\n\nFrom the preceding account, and his having constantly found the above-mentioned beaks of the sepia in all pieces of ambergris of any considerable size, Dr Swediaur concludes with great probability, that all ambergris is generated in the bowels of the phyceter macrocephalus or spermaceti whale; and there mixed with the beaks of the sepia octopodia, which is the principal food of that whale. He therefore defines ambergris to be the preternaturally hardened dung or faeces of the phyceter macrocephalus, mixed with some indigestible relics of its food.\n\nThe opinion of Dr Swediaur, with regard to the origin of ambergris, has been confirmed by the information of Captain J. Coffin, master of a ship employed in the southern whale fishery, given to a committee of privy council in the year 1791. According to Mr Coffin's information, American ships had sometimes found small quantities of ambergris; but none, that he knew of, had ever been found by British ships. The quantity which he had brought home amounted to 362 ounces; and it was taken from the body of a female spermaceti whale on the coast of Guinea, which was\nAmbergris was lean, sickly, and old; and yielded but a small proportion of oil. While the people were employed in cutting up the blubber, ambergris was discovered coming from the fundament of the whale, and a piece of it was seen floating on the surface of the sea. More was observed in the same passage, and the rest was found in a bag a little below the passage and communicating with it. Mr Coffin supposes, that the sperm whale feeds almost wholly on the sepia or squid; for when the whale is dying a quantity of this fish, sometimes whole, sometimes in pieces, is thrown up. The bills of the squid were found, some on the outside adhering to it, and some mixed with it. The sperm whale, when struck, generally voids her excrement, and if she does not, Mr Coffin conjectures, that she has no ambergris; for he supposes, that the production of it is the cause or the effect of some disorder; and that it is most likely to be found in a sickly fish. The ambergris of the whale taken by Mr Coffin was mostly sold at 19s. 9d. per ounce; and a small part of it, when it was scarce, at 25s. It was bought partly for home consumption, and partly for exportation to Turkey, Germany, and France. (Phil. Trans., vol. lxxxii.)\n\nThe use of ambergris in Europe is now nearly confined to perfumery, though it has formerly been recommended in medicine by several eminent physicians. Hence the Effentia Ambrae Hoffmanni, Tinctura Regia Cod. Parisini, Trochisci de Ambra Ph. Wurtemberg, &c.\n\nIf we wish to see any medicinal effects from this substance, the Doctor observes, we must certainly not expect them from two or three grains, but give rather as many scruples of it for a dose; though even then, he thinks, there would not be reason to expect much effect from it, as he had himself taken of pure unadulterated ambergris in powder 30 grains at once without observing the least sensible effect from it. A sailor, however, who had the curiosity to try the effect of recent ambergris upon himself, took half an ounce of it melted upon the fire, and found it a good purgative; which proves that it is not quite an inert substance.\n\nIn Asia and part of Africa ambergris is not only used as a medicine and a perfume; but considerable use is also made of it in cookery, by adding it to several dishes as a spice. A great quantity of it is also constantly bought by the pilgrims who travel to Mecca; probably to offer it there, and make use of it in fumigations, in the same manner as frankincense is used in Catholic countries. The Turks make use of it as an aphrodisiac. Our perfumers add it to scented pills, candles, balls, bottles, gloves, and hairpowder; and its essence is mixed with pomatums, for the face and hands, either alone or mixed with musk, &c. though its smell is to some persons extremely offensive.\n\nAmbergris may be known to be genuine by its fragrant scent when a hot needle or pin is thrust into it, and its melting like fat of an uniform consistence; whereas the counterfeit will not yield such a smell, nor prove of such a fat texture. One thing, however, is very remarkable, that this drug, which is the most sweet of all the perfumes, should be capable of being resembled in smell by a preparation of one of the most odious of all stinks. Mr Homberg found, that a vessel in which he had made a long digestion of human faeces, acquired a very strong and perfect smell of ambergris, in so much that any one would have thought a great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it. The perfume was so strong and offensive, that the vessel was forced to be removed out of the laboratory.\n\nAMBERT, a small town of France, in the department of Puy de Dome, formerly Lower Auvergne.

As to the natural cause of this faculty, some, as Hoffer, attribute it to an extraordinary supply of blood and spirits from the heart and brain, which furnishes both hands with the necessary strength and agility; others, as Nicholas Massa, to an erect situation of the heart, inclining neither to the right hand nor left; and others to the right and left subclavian arteries being of the same height, and the same distance from the heart, by which the blood is propelled with equal force to both hands. But these are only conjectures, or rather chimeras. Many think, that were it not for education and habit, all mankind would be ambidexters; and in fact, we frequently find nurses obliged to be at a good deal of pains before they can bring children to forego the use of their left hands. How far it may be an advantage to be deprived of half our natural dexterity, may be doubted. It is certain, there are infinite occasions in life, when it would be better to have the equal use of both hands. Surgeons and occultists are of necessity obliged to be ambidexters; bleeding, &c. in the left arm or left ankle, and operations on the left eye, cannot be well performed but with the left hand. —Various instances occur in history, where the left hand has been exercised preferably to the right. But by the laws of the ancient Scythians, people were enjoined to exercise both hands alike; and Plato enjoins ambidexterity to be observed and encouraged in his republic.\n\nAMBIDENTER, among English Lawyers, a juror or embracer, who accepts money of both parties, for giving his verdict: an offence for which he is liable to be imprisoned, for ever excluded from a jury, and to pay ten times the sum he accepted.\n\nAMBIENT, a term used for such bodies, especially fluids,\nAmbient fluids, as compass others on all sides; thus, the air is frequently called an ambient fluid, because it is diffused round the earth.\n\nAMBIERLE, a town of France, in the department of the Rhone and Loire.

See PERIMETER.\n\nAMBIT was particularly used, in antiquity, to denote a space of ground to be left vacant betwixt one building and another. By the laws of the twelve tables, houses were not to be built contiguous, but an ambit or space of 2½ feet was to be left about each for fear of fire.—The ambitus of a tomb or monument denoted a certain number of feet, in length and breadth, around the same, within which the sanctity assigned to it was limited. The whole ground wherein a tomb was erected was not to be secreted from the common uses; for this reason, it was frequent to inscribe the ambit on it, that it might be known how far its sanctity extended: thus, in fronte pedes tot, in agrum pedes tot.\n\nAMBITION (ambitio) is generally used in a bad sense, for an inordinate or illegal pursuit of power.\n\nIn the strict meaning, however, of the word, it signifies the same with the ambitus of the Romans.

It swells gradually with success; and every acquisition serves but as a spur to further attempts.\n\n\"If a man (it has been well observed) could at once accomplish all his desires, he would be a miserable creature; for the chief pleasure of this life is to wish and desire.

The first, called also ambitus popularis, was when a person offered his service to the republic frankly, leaving it to every body to judge of his pretensions as they found reasonable. The means and instruments here made use of were various. 1. Amici, or friends, under different relations, including cognati, affines, necessarii, familiares, vicini, tribules, clientes, municipes, sodales, college. 2. Nomenclatura, or the calling and saluting every person by his name; to which purpose, the candidates were attended by an officer, under the denomination of interpret, or nomenclator. 3. Blanditia, or obliging persons, by serving them, or their friends, patrons, or the like, with their vote and interest on other occasions. 4. Prehensio, the shaking every person by the hand, offering him his service, friendship, &c. The second kind was that wherein force, cajoling, money, or other extraordinary influence, was made use of. This was held infamous, and severely punished, as a source of corruption and other mischiefs.\n\nAmbitus was practised, not only at Rome, and in the forum, but in the meetings and assemblies of other towns in Italy, where numbers of citizens were usually found, on account of trade and business. The practice ceased in the city from the time of the emperors, by reason poets were not then to be had by courting the people, but by favour from the prince.\n\nPersons who had causes depending practised the same, going about among the judges to implore their favour and mercy. They who practised this were called Ambitiosi. Hence we also meet with ambitiosa decreta, and ambitiosa justa, used for such sentences and decrees as were thus procured from the judges, contrary to reason and equity, either gratuitously or for money.\n\nAMBLE, in Horsemanship, a peculiar pace by which a horse's two legs of the same side move at the same time.

The town is the capital of a district, and has been rendered famous in history by the conspiracy of the Protestants in 1560, which opened the fatal wars of religion in France. The castle is situated on a craggy rock, extremely difficult of access, and the sides of which are almost perpendicular. At its foot flows the Loire, which is divided into two streams by a small island. To this fortress the duke of Guise, when he expected an insurrection among the Huguenots, removed Francis II. as to a place of perfect security. Only two detached parts of the ancient castle now remain, one of which was constructed by Charles VIII. and the other by Francis I. The former of these princes was born and died at Amboise. The town is situated in E. Long. 1. 10. N. Lat. 47. 25.\n\nAMBOISE, D', Francis, son of a surgeon to Charles IX. of France. He very early obtained the patronage of that prince, and was supported by his liberality in the prosecution of his studies at the university of Navarre, where he devoted his talents to rhetoric and philosophy with great assiduity and success. His eloquence and extensive information raised him in 1572 to the place of solicitor of the French nation. He afterwards applied to the study of the law, and became one of the most accomplished advocates of the parliament of Paris. He was next advanced to be counsellor in the parliament of Bretagne, and next to be a master of requests and counsellor of state. He visited different countries, and published the history of his travels, with several poetical pieces. He prefixed an apologetical preface to the edition of Abelard's works in 1616, and with much industry collected many of his manuscripts. His brother Adrian rose to considerable consequence in the church; and his brother James was not less eminent as a physician. (Gen. Diet.)\n\nAMBOISE, D', George, a French cardinal and minister of state, was born in the year 1460. His father was a descendant of the renowned house of Amboise, and, through the influence of his powerful connexions, he beheld the path of church preferment open before his son; therefore he destined him to the clerical order. In these languishing expectations he was not disappointed; for he had sufficient influence to procure for him the bishopric of Montauban at the early age of fourteen. Louis XI. appointed him one of his almoners; and in the course of political events, he became strongly attached to the duke of Orleans, and suffered imprisonment in his cause. When this prince, however, had regained his favour at court, he was elevated to the archbishopric of Narbonne. After he had remained there for some time, he changed that station for the archbishopric of Rouen. When the duke of Orleans was governor of Normandy, he made him lieutenant general; and in that situation he was of essential service to the province, in restoring justice and order. When the duke of Orleans became Louis XII., Amboise was suddenly raised to the elevated station of first minister and one of the cardinals. The same regard to equity, which characterized his conduct when lieutenant general induced him to diminish the imposts, which rendered him very popular as first minister of France. In 1499, by his advice, the king undertook the conquest of the Milanese, and, on their revolt, the first minister was sent to quell the rebellion. The great confidence which Louis had reposed in him, induced the pope to make him his legate in France; and, in that station, he piously laboured to reform the ecclesiastical orders. He enforced his doctrine by precept, not only in setting them an example of holding no more benefices than one at a time, but also by devoting two-thirds of the revenue of the same to the poor, and to the repair of religious edifices. According to his own account he was ambitious of the papal chair, \"merely for the purpose of effecting the reformation of abuses and the correction of manners.\" It is reported that, upon the death of Pius III., he would have been elected pope had he not been deceived by the Italian cardinals. Disappointed in his views with regard to the papal honours, he persuaded his master to declare war against the Venetians, to whose influence he supposed his failure was owing. But this imprudent undertaking was suddenly interrupted; for in the prosecution of his journey for the Venetian war, he was seized with an illness, and confined in the city of Lyons. Affliction robs the reflecting powers of the mind, and calls to remembrance the past actions of life. From the confidanthefs of his past errors and faults he was induced to express his contrition to a brother of the infirmary who attended him at the convent of the Celestines. In the year 1510, and in the 50th of his age, he breathed his last in that place. Industry, readiness, and good intention, characterized his conduct as a prime minister. He shone with peculiar brightness as a man of literature. By his liberality and patronage, the arts and sciences flourished under his administration. It may be proper to add, that, assisted by some\nAmboule, of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom; he formed a code of laws to reform the reigning abuses in the nation. Thus, by steadily pursuing the general welfare, he obtained the appellation of the \"father of the people.\"\n\n(Gener. Biog.)\n\nAMBOULE, a province of Madagascar, somewhat to the northward of S.

The black cattle are extremely fat, and their flesh excellent. In this province stands a large town of the same name; near which is a fountain of hot water, within 20 feet of a small river whose land is almost burning. The water of the fountain is said to boil an egg hard in two hours; and the inhabitants affirm it to be a sovereign remedy against the gout.\n\nThe people here are employed in different preparations of iron and steel, which they have from their own mines, and forge several instruments with tolerable skill. Their governor is honoured with the title of Roberlau, or Great Lord. He exercises sovereign authority and absolute power; but is frequently, in times of distress, surprised by his subjects, who assemble in great numbers, seize his person, and threaten him with death unless they are relieved. To extricate himself from this dilemma he is instantly obliged to issue orders for distributing provisions among them; but is usually repaid with interest, a quadruple return being made in a plentiful harvest. The people of Amboule live in great licentiousness with their superiors, and their country is generally a retreat for the rough and lazy.\n\nAMBOYNA, one of the Molucca islands in the East Indies. It lies in S. Lat. 3° 36' and E. Long. 126° 20', and is remarkable for being the centre of the commerce for nutmegs and cloves, which is entirely monopolized by the Dutch East India Company. It is about 24 leagues in circumference. Besides cloves, it likewise abounds in most of the tropical fruits and fish; nor is there here any deficiency of good water; but flesh is very scarce. This scarcity, however, proceeds more from the policy of the Dutch than either the intemperance of the climate, or the barrenness of the soil: For, excepting cloves, they have in Amboyna, as well as the Moluccas, industriously discouraged the cultivation of every edulent commodity, with the view of withholding subsistence from those who might be tempted to invade them.\n\nOf the natives, the men wear large whiskers, but leave little hair upon the chin; and have only a slight piece of stuff wrapped round their middle. The women tie their hair in knots: the maids are bought of their fathers before they are married; and if the wife proves barren, the marriage is dissolved. Some of the natives are Mahometans, and some Christians: but they are all said to be lazy, deceitful, and treacherous. They make war with small swift vessels, in shape like dragons with regard to the head and tail. Their houses are built of bamboo canes and fago trees. They sleep on mats. Their weapons are bows and arrows, javelins, scimitars, and targets.\n\nAmboyna was first discovered by the Portuguese, who built a fort upon it, which was taken from them by the Dutch in 1605. They did not, however, become masters of the whole island at once. The English had here five factors, who lived under the protection of the Dutch cattle; holding themselves safe, in respect of the friendship between the two nations. Great differences had arisen between the Dutch and English colonists in this part of the world; till at last, the English East India Company applying to King James, a treaty was concluded in 1619, by which the concerns both of the English and Dutch were regulated, and certain measures agreed upon for preventing future disputes. This was an additional security to the English; and, by virtue of the treaty, they continued two years in Amboyna, trading with the Dutch. During this time, however, several disputes happened; which occasioning mutual discontentments, the complaints were sent to Jacatra, in the island of Java Major, to the council of defence of both nations resident there: but they not agreeing, a state of the matter was sent over to Europe, to be decided by the East India Companies of both nations; or, in case they could not agree, by the king of England and the states of Holland, according to an article in the treaty of 1619.—But before these disputes could be decided in a legal way, the Dutch, in order to give the more specious colouring to the violent seizure which they meditated of the island of Amboyna, made use of the stale pretext of a conspiracy being formed by the English and Japanese to dispossess them of one of their forts in this place. The plot, it was alleged, had been confabulated by a Japanese and Portuguese in the English service, who were most unhappily tortured till they should answer in the affirmative such interrogatories as might favour the secret design of those cruel inquisitors. Upon the injurious evidence of this constrained declaration, they immediately accused the English factors of the pretended conspiracy. Some of them they imprisoned, and others they loaded with irons, and sent on board their ships; seizing at the same time all the English merchandise, with their writings and books.\n\nThese acts of violence were followed by a scene of horror unexampled in the punishment of the most atrocious offenders. Some of the factors they tortured, by compelling them to swallow water till their bodies were distended to the utmost pitch; then taking the miserable victims down from the boards to which they had been fastened, and causing them to disgorge the water: if they did not acknowledge the imputed guilt, the process of torture was repeated. Others of the English they consumed by burning them gradually from the feet upwards, in order to extort the confession of a conspiracy, which was only pretended by the internal policy of those savage tormentors. Some had the nails of the fingers and toes torn off; and in some they made holes in their breasts, filling the cavities with inflammable materials, to which they afterwards put fire. Those who did not expire under the agonies of torture were confined to the hands of the executioner.\n\nThe allegation of this pretended conspiracy was equally void of probability and truth. The Dutch had a garrison of 300 men in the fort, besides the burghers in the town, and several other forts and garrisons in the island, while the number of the English did not amount to 20 men; nor were even those provided with arms or ammunition to effect such a design as that with which they were charged. There likewise was not one\nAmboyna. English vessel in the harbour, whereas the Dutch had eight ships riding near the town; neither, when the Dutch broke open the desks and trunks of the factors, was there found a single paper or letter which could be construed into the most distant relation to any conspiracy. Add to all this, that each of the unhappy sufferers as could speak to be heard, declared in the most solemn manner their innocence of the plot with which they were charged.\n\nThe whole of the transaction affords the most irrefragable testimony, that it was founded entirely upon a political fiction of the Hollander, who had themselves formed the design of monopolizing the trade of the Spice Islands; for the accomplishment of which they perpetrated, about the same time, a singular tragedy at Pooleon, where they put to the torture 162 of the natives, whom they likewise charged with a pretended conspiracy. It may justly be reckoned singular in the fortune of this commercial republic, that they have ever since been permitted to enjoy in peace those invaluable islands, which were originally obtained by such atrocious infringements of humanity and the laws of nations, as will stain the Dutch annals, to the latest ages, with indelible infamy.\n\nThe more effectually to preserve this trade, the Dutch have had all the clove trees in the adjacent islands grubbed up. Sometimes also, when the harvest is very large, part of the produce of Amboyna itself is burnt. To prevent the rearing of cloves in any of the neighbouring islands, or the inhabitants from selling them to strangers, the governor of Amboyna makes the tour of his government with a fleet of curriculuses, confining sometimes of 20, and at others of 30, 40, or 50 sail. This expedition is made with all the pomp imaginable, in order to gratify the pride and folly of the Indian chiefs. The true reason of their taking all this pains is, because experience has shown, that no contracts, however solemn, can prevent the inhabitants of those islands from selling their spice to strangers: and even now, frauds are frequently practised by the Dutch themselves, though the Company is inexorable in punishing them, that the common people call the cloves galgen-bruid, that is, the gallows spice.\n\nBesides the cloves, coffee is also cultivated here by the Dutch, and a gold mine has been lately found out. This was discovered by the quantities of gold dust that were washed from some mountains by the torrents. Here also grow several kinds of valuable wood, of which they make tables, chairs, escritoires, &c. for the principal persons in the government; and the rest is sold all over the Indies at a very extravagant rate.\n\nAmboyna is divided into two parts, viz. a greater and lesser peninsula. The former, called Hilton, is 12 leagues in length, and two and a half broad. In this the Dutch have no less than five forts, or rather strong redoubts, mounted with cannon. The other is called Leytimor, five leagues in length, and one and a half broad, which is the southern part of the island; on this stands the fort of Victoria, which is the residence of the governor and his council, composed of 15 gentlemen or merchants. The fortress is a square, the ramparts mounted with 60 pieces of brass cannon, and the garrison usually composed of 600 men. It is so strong by nature and art, as to be in a manner impregnable; and so effectually does it command the harbour, that no vessel could come in or go out without being sunk by the cannon, if the governor chose. The inhabitants of Amboyna are computed at 70 or 80,000, of whom but a small number are Dutch; and this obliges the latter to be continually upon their guard, and to keep a competent number of troops in each of their forts, particularly in that of Middleburgh, which stands upon the isthmus that connects these peninsulas. There are also redoubts and garrisons in all the islands of this government.\n\nAMBRACIA, one of the most considerable cities of ancient Epirus, situated on the river Arachthus, at a small distance from the sea. At first it was a free city; but was afterwards reduced by the Aetolian kings of Epirus, who chose it for the place of their residence. In process of time, the Aetolians made themselves masters of it, and held it till the year before Christ 189, when it fell into the hands of the Romans.\n\nAt this time Ambracia was a place of great strength. It was defended on one side by the river Arachthus, and on the other by steep and craggy hills; and surrounded with a high and thick wall, above three miles in compass. The Roman consul Fulvius began the siege by forming two camps, separated by the river, but with a communication between them; the Romans were posted in one, and the Epirots their allies in the other. He then threw up two lines, one of circumvallation, the other of contravallation; and built a wooden tower in form of a castle, over against the citadel, which stood on a hill. The Aetolians, however, before the lines were quite finished, found means to throw about 1000 men into the place.\n\nThe lines being completed, the city was attacked in five different places at once. The battering rams shook the walls on all sides: and the Romans, from their moveable towers, pulled down the battlements with a kind of scythes, which they fastened to long beams. The besieged made a vigorous defence. They were night and day on the walls, and indefatigable in preventing the effects of the rams and scythes. The strokes of the former they deadened, by letting down beams, large stones, lumps of lead, &c. by means of pulleys, upon them when they were in motion: the others they rendered useless, by pulling the beams to which they were fastened into the city with hooks contrived for the purpose.\n\nWhile Fulvius was carrying on the siege, Nicander the Aetolian praetor, found means to throw 500 men into the city, under the command of one Nicodamus, with whom Nicander agreed to attack the Roman camp in the night time; not doubting, that, if the garrison from within, and the army from without, fell upon them at the same time, they would be obliged to raise the siege. Nicodamus narrowly watched the time at which he was ordered to fall; and though Nicander did not appear, marched out at the head of the garrison, armed with firebrands and torches. The Roman sentinels, surprized at this sight, ran to wake the legionaries, and soon spread a general alarm all over the camp. The legionaries marched in small bodies as they happened to meet, to repulse the enemy, whom they engaged in three different places. Two parties of the garrison were driven back; but the third, commanded\nAMBRESBURY, or Amesbury, a market town in Wiltshire, about six miles north of Salisbury, and situated in W. Long. 1° 40' and N. Lat. 51° 20'.\n\nAMBRONES, a Gaulish people who lived near the foot of the Alps, between Switzerland and Provence. They invaded the Roman territories in conjunction with the Cimbri and Teutones; but were defeated with great slaughter by Marius, about 101 years before Christ. Their women, who had fled during the engagement in a kind of fortification made with their carts, on seeing their husbands dying, and the Romans at their heels, armed themselves with axes, and gnawing with their teeth, fell with fury on the pursuers and the pursued. Their first rage being spent, they desired to surrender themselves, upon the single condition, that their chastity should not be violated; but this equitable request being denied, they first killed their children, and then themselves, not one remaining alive out of the whole multitude.\n\nAMBROSE, Saint, an island in the South Pacific ocean, on the coast of Chili, four or five leagues due west from St Felix island. At first view, it appears like two small islands; but after a nearer approach, it is found they are joined by a reef. It lies in S. Lat. 26° 13'. W. Long. 80° 55' from Greenwich. There is a large rock 4 miles to the northward of the island, called, from its appearance, Sail-rock. Captain Roberts, who was here in 1792, found St Felix island inaccessible. On St Ambroise island, his crew killed and cured 13,000 seal skins of the best quality, in seven weeks. The island has little else to recommend it. Fish and crawfish abound. The best season for sealing is from the 1st of April to the 1st of August.\n\nAmbrose of Alexandria, lived in the beginning of the third century, and was the intimate friend of Origen. Jerome and Eusebius differ in the account they give of this man. One denominates him a Marcionite, the other a Valentinian; but they both agree that he was converted to the orthodox faith, through means of the preaching of Origen. As is generally the case with new proselytes, he became very zealous, and was appointed deacon either at Alexandria, or at Caesarea, where Protecletus was presbyter. Origen dedicated many of his works, and among others his book on martyrdom, to Ambrose; at whose desire and expense they were published. Origen and Ambrose were alike indefatigable in their application to study, and lived in terms of the most intimate friendship. Origen being poor, Ambrose assisted him, by providing notaries and amanuenses to copy his works.\n\nIn that period of society, when the increase of copies was a work of immense labour and great expense, there were not only instances of private friendship, but of public utility. Ambrose is thus justly entitled to rank among the patrons of learning. Ambrose has been blamed by some, for having made no provision at his death for the poor infant Origen. The friends of Ambrose excuse this part of his conduct, by saying, that Origen chose to live poor, and daily dependant on\nAmbrose, a divine Providence. According to some historians, Ambrose died as a martyr, along with his friend Pro- tectetus, in the persecution under Maximin, about the year 236; but the dedication of Origen's eight books against Celsus shows, that though he died before Ori-gen, yet he lived to the year 250, or near that period. Origen speaks of him as a man of great piety, and much devoted to the study of the sacred Scriptures.\n\n(Ambrose, bishop of Milan, was one of the most eminent fathers of the church in the fourth century. He was a citizen of Rome, and born in France; some historians say in the year 334, but others say in the year 340. The birth of Ambrose is said to have been attended with a remarkable prefiguration of his future eloquence, by a swarm of bees coming and settling upon his mouth as he lay in his cradle. At the period of his birth, his father was Praetorian prefect of Gallia Narbonensis; but upon his death, the widow repaired to Rome with her family. Ambrose received a religious education, and was reared in the habits of virtuous conduct by his mother, who was an accomplished woman, and eminent for piety. The names of those masters who instructed him in the rudiments of the Greek and Roman literature have not been transmitted to posterity: but in these branches he made early proficiency; and, having directed his attention to the law, he employed his eloquence with such reputation in the Praetorian court of Anicius Probus, that he was soon deemed worthy of a place in the council. After he had continued in this station for some time, Probus appointed him consul of Liguria and Emilia, comprehending the territories of Milan, Liguria, Turin, Genoa, and Bologna. Milan was chosen for the place of his residence, and by the prudent and gentle use of his power, he conducted the affairs of the province with general approbation and growing popularity.\n\nIn the year 374, Auxentius the bishop of that city died, and his death gave a sudden change to the fortune and literary pursuits of Ambrose. At that period, the tide of religious contention ran high between the Catholics and the Arians, and there ensued a strong contest concerning the choice of a new bishop. When the people assembled in the church to elect Ambrose, in the character of governor of the place, went into the assembly, and, in a grave, eloquent, and pathetic address, admonished the multitude to lay aside their contentions, and, in the spirit of religious meekness, to proceed to the important work of choosing a bishop. It is reported, that when Ambrose had finished his address, a child cried out, \"Ambrose is bishop.\" The agitated multitude suddenly caught the superstitious flame, and regarding this as a miraculous intimation, they unanimously elected Ambrose bishop of Milan. Some suppose that this was entirely a device of Ambrose or his friends, and others ascribe it to mere accident. Ambrose strongly affected reluctance, and even pretended to fly from the city in order to avoid the intended honour. It is, however, unfortunate for the artifice of the governor that the place of his concealment was soon discovered, when the will of the emperor was known concerning the confirmation of his election. Finding it inconvenient any longer to reflect the public choice, he exchanged the ensigns of civil for those of ecclesiastical dignity; and, after being baptized, he was ordained bishop of Milan, about the end of the year 374.\n\nBut whatever may be the sentiments of mankind concerning the singular conduct of Ambrose in accepting an office for which he was certainly unqualified in respect of previous studies, habits, and employments, yet it must be admitted, that he immediately betook himself to the necessary studies, and with ability, boldness, and integrity, acquitted himself in his new elevation. Having appropriated his money to the poor, settled his lands upon the church, with the exception of making his foster tenant during life, and having committed the care of his family to his brother, he entered upon a regular course of theological study, under the care of Simplician, a presbyter of Rome, and devoted himself to the labours of the church.\n\nCompelled by the irruption of the Goths and the northern barbarians, who rushed down upon the Roman empire, spreading terror and desolation all around, Ambrose, along with several others, fled to Illyricum; but he remained only a short period in exile, for the northern invaders were quickly defeated by the forces of the emperor, and driven back with considerable loss into their own dominions; therefore, he and his companions returned to their respective habitations.\n\nAfter he returned to his ecclesiastical station, the eloquence and abilities of that zealous bishop found ample scope in the dispute between the Arians and the Catholics. About this era, the doctrine of Arius concerning the person of Christ had been extensively received, and had many powerful defenders, both among the clergy and the common people. Ambrose espoused the cause of the Catholics. Gratian, the son of the elder Valentinian, marshalled on the same side. But the younger Valentinian, who was now become his colleague in the empire, adopted the opinions of the Arians; and all the arguments and eloquence of Ambrose were insufficient to reclaim the young prince to the orthodox faith. Theodosius, the emperor of the east, also professed the orthodox faith, yet there were numerous adherents to Arius scattered throughout his dominions. In this general state of religious opinions in the empire, two leaders of the Arians, Palladius and Secundianus, confident of numbers, prevailed upon Gratian to call a general council from all parts of the empire. This request appeared so equitable that he complied without hesitation, but Ambrose, aware of the consequence, had the eloquence to persuade the emperor that a general council was improper, and that the matter could be determined by a council of the western bishops. The result was, that a synod, composed of 32 bishops, was held at Aquileia in the year 381. Ambrose was elected president, and Palladius being called upon to defend his opinions, declined; insisting that the meeting was a partial one, and that the whole bishops of the empire not being present, the feme of the Christian church could not be obtained concerning the question in dispute. Ambrose mentioned several precedents in favour of the authority of the court, and added, that the oriental bishops being acquainted with the place and nature of the meeting, might have been present, if they had deemed the matter in difficulty.\nAmbrose. fion worthy of their attention; therefore, the court, although Palladius persisted in his refusal to plead his cause, put the vote, and he, along with his associate Secundianus, was ejected from the episcopal office.\n\nIf Ambrose displayed great zeal in opposing the errors of Arius, he displayed equal zeal in opposing the heathen superstitions. Many of the senators remaining strongly attached to the heathen idolatry, upon Valentinian II. ascending the throne, they made a vigorous effort to restore the worship of the heathen deities. Symmachus, a very opulent man, and a great orator, who was at that time prefect of the city, was entrusted with the management of the pagan cause, and drew up a petition, praying that the altar of Victory might be restored to its ancient station in the hall of the senate, and for the proper support of seven veiled virgins, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies. Great eloquence and peculiar infirmation characterized the petition. He argued that this form of religion had long been profitable to the Roman state, reminded the emperor how much Rome had been indebted to victory, and that it had been the uniform custom of the senators to swear fidelity to the government upon that altar. He likewise produced many facts to prove the advantages derived to the state from its ancient religious institutions, and intimated that it was one divinity that all men worshipped under different forms, so that ancient practice should not be rashly laid aside. He even proceeded so far as to state the injustice of increasing the public revenue by robbing the church, and attributed the late famine which had overtaken the empire to the neglect of the ancient worship.\n\nTo this petition, Ambrose replied in a letter to Valentinian, arguing that the devoted worshippers of idols had often been forsaken by their deities; that the native valour of the Roman soldiers had gained her victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan priests; that these idolatrous worshippers requested for themselves what they refused to Christians; that willing virginity was more honourable than that procured by the public money; that as the Christian ministers declined taking temporal emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to suppose that God would send a famine upon the empire for neglecting to support a religious system contrary to his revealed will in the Scriptures; that the whole proceeds of nature encouraged innovations; and that all nations had permitted these, even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were exceedingly offensive to Christians; and that every Christian prince should suppress these pagan ceremonies.\n\nIn the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose, both the petition and the reply are preserved, in which folly, superstition, sound sense, and solid argument, are strangely blended. It is scarcely necessary to add that the petition was unsuccessful.\n\nThe increasing strength of the Arians proved too formidable for the zealous Ambrose. The young emperor and Justina, along with a considerable number of clergy and laity professing the Arian faith, requested from the bishop the use of two churches, one in the city, the other in the suburbs of Milan. The prelate believing the bishops to be the guardians, both of the temporal and spiritual interests of the church, and that the religious edifices were the unquestionable property of the church, positively refused to deliver up the temples of the Lord into the impious hands of heretics. Filled with indignation, Justina resolved to employ the imperial authority of her son in procuring by force what she could not by persuasion. Ambrose was required to answer for his conduct before the council. He went, attended by a numerous crowd of people, whose impetuous zeal so overawed the ministers of Valentinian, that he was permitted to retire without making the surrender of the churches. The day following, when he was performing divine service in the Basilica, the prefect of the city came to persuade him to give up at least the Portian church in the suburbs. Still continuing obstinate, the court proceeded to violent measures. The officers of the household were commanded to prepare the Basilica and the Portian churches to celebrate divine service upon the arrival of the emperor and his mother at the ensuing festival of Easter. The order respecting one of them was carried into effect, but the court perceiving the growing strength of the prelate's interest, deemed it prudent to use softer measures; but all measures proved in vain: the bishop boldly replied, \"If you demand my person, I am ready to submit: carry me to prison or to death, I will not resist; but I will never betray the church of Christ. I will not call upon the people to succour me; I will die at the foot of the altar, rather than desert it. The tumult of the people I will not encourage, but God alone can appease.\" This strong declaration was followed by a torrent of eloquence from the pulpit, pursuing his scheme with the most violent zeal. But the court remained unconvinced, and another attempt being made, under a strong guard of ferocious Goths, to seize the church of Basilica; when they were about to enter, Ambrose thundered the sentence of excommunication against them, and so overawed them that they retired; and Ambrose and his friends remained in possession of the churches. About this time, also, an Arian bishop challenged Ambrose to a dispute before the emperor; but he declined, saying that matters of faith should be determined by a council of bishops.\n\nMany circumstances in the history of Ambrose are strongly characteristic of the general spirit of the times. The chief causes of his victory over his opponents were, his great popularity, and the superstitious reverence paid to the episcopal character at that period of society. But it must also be admitted, that he used several indirect means to obtain and support his popular authority. Many indigent persons were supported by his liberal bounty; in his explanations of Scripture he made constant and severe allusions to existing and public characters; the alternate mode of singing had no small effect upon the minds of the vulgar. At a time when the influence of Ambrose required vigorous support, he fortunately was admonished in a dream to search for the remains of Gervasius and Protasius, two martyrs who had quietly repose under the pavement of the church. The skeletons were found entire, were stained with blood, and the head of one of them separated from the body. The vulgar crowded in thousands to behold these venerable relics. According to report,\nAmbrose report, a blind man was restored to sight, several demons were expelled, and sick persons healed by touching these bones. Ambrose exulted in these miracles, and appealed to them in his eloquent sermons; whilst the court derided and called in question their existence. The bishop continued firm in his opinions; the people believed; and the existence of the miracles was established. And it is a very singular fact, that there, and many other miracles, obtained current credit among the Christian historians of the second, third, and fourth centuries. Dr Cave in speaking of them says, \"I make no doubt but God suffered them to be wrought, at this time, on purpose to confront the Arian imposters.\"\n\nAlthough the court were displeased with the religious principles and conduct of Ambrose, yet they respected his great political talents; and when necessity required, they solicited his aid, which he generously granted. When Maxentius usurped the supreme power in Gaul, and was meditating a descent upon Italy, Valentinian sent Ambrose to him, who prevailed upon him to desist from the undertaking. On a second attempt of the same kind Ambrose was employed; and, although he was unsuccessful, yet, if his advice had been followed upon his return, the schemes of the usurper would have proved abortive; but indifferent to his counsels, the enemy was permitted to enter Italy, and Milan was taken. Jutina and her son fled; but Ambrose remained in his station, and proved beneficial to many of the sufferers, by causing the plate of the church to be melted for their relief. Theodosius, the emperor of the East, espoused the cause of Jutina, and by force of arms regained the kingdom.\n\nIn the year 392, a tumult happened at Thessalonica, in which Botheric, one of the officers of Theodosius was slain; and he was so greatly enraged, that he issued a royal mandate for the promiscuous massacre of the inhabitants of that place: and about seven thousand persons were assassinated, without distinction or mercy. The courageous Ambrose, informed of this deed, wrote to the emperor a severe reproof, and an earnest admonition, charging him not to approach the holy communion with his hands stained with innocent blood. When the emperor was about to enter the church of Milan to attend upon the service, the bishop met him, and with a stern countenance prohibited him from approaching the temple of God. The emperor reminded him that David had been guilty of murder and of adultery. The bishop replied, You have \"imitated David in his guilt; go and imitate him in his repentance.\" The prince obeyed the priest, and, by a course of penitential sorrow, during the space of eight months, he laboured to regain the favour of the church. After the termination of this period, he was absolved, but at the same time was made to sign an edict that an interval of thirty days should intervene before the sentence of death or confiscation should be put in execution. When the mind reflects upon the numerous bad effects of instant and violent passion, this measure was certainly fraught with policy and humanity. If the reader laments the weakness which subjected the conscience to the clerical power, he must be gratified that a moderate use was made of that authority.\n\nThe undaunted courage of Ambrose received another severe trial in the year 392, after the assassination of Valentinian, and the base Eugenius had usurped the empire of the west. Rather than join the standard of the usurper, he fled from Milan. But after the army of Theodosius was victorious, he generously supplicated the emperor for the pardon of those who had supported the cause of Eugenius. Theodosius, soon after he had acquired the uncontrolled possession of the Roman empire, died at Milan. The bishop did not long survive the emperor; but died in the year 397. In his last illness he preserved perfect composure of mind, informing his friends that he had endeavoured so to conduct himself that he might neither be ashamed to live nor to die.\n\nOn many accounts the character of the bishop of Milan stands high among the fathers of the ancient church. With unvarying steadfastness he delivered his religious sentiments on all occasions; with unwearied assiduity he discharged the duties of his office; with unabated zeal and boldness he defended the orthodox cause, in opposition to the Arians; with a liberal hand he fed the numerous poor who flocked to his dwelling; with uncommon generosity he manifested kindness to his adversaries; and with Christian affection he sought the happiness of all men. His general habits were amiable and virtuous, and his powers of mind were uncommonly vigorous and persevering. Ambition and bigotry were the chief blemishes in his character.\n\nThe writings of Ambrose are voluminous, although little more than adulterated editions of Origen and other Greek fathers. The great design of his writings was to defend and propagate the Catholic faith. In some of these he recommends perpetual celibacy as the perfection of Christian virtue. Modern judgment and taste may perhaps induce some to esteem the writings of Ambrose absurd, trivial, and even ludicrous; but there is a freshness and vigour in his style, and there are excellent sentiments interspersed, which render the writings of the bishop of Milan worthy of a perusal. With his usual severity and acrimony, Gibbons too severely censures this prelate. \"Ambrose (says he) could act better than he could write; his compositions are destitute of taste or genius, without the spirit of Tertullian, the copious elegance of Lactantius, the lively wit of Jerome, or the grave energy of Augustin.\" The most accurate and complete edition of his works, is that published by the Benedictine monks printed at Paris in two volumes in 1682. (Gen. Biog.)\n\nAmbrose, Isaac, an eminent Presbyterian minister, was educated at Brazen-nose college Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts, and became minister of Preston, and afterwards of Garstang in Lancashire, whence he was in 1662 ejected for nonconformity. It was usual for him to retire every year for a month into a little hut in a wood, where he shunned all society, and devoted himself to religious contemplation. Dr Calamy observes, that he had a very strong impulse on his mind of the approach of death, and took a formal leave of his friends at their houses a little before his departure; and the last night of his life he sent his discourse concerning angels to the press. The next day he shut himself up in his parlour, where to the great surprize and regret of all who saw him, he\nAmbrose was found just expiring. He died in 1663-4, in the 72d year of his age. He wrote several other books; as the Prima, Media, et Ultima, or the First, Middle, and Last Things; War with Devils; Looking unto Jesus, &c.\n\nAmbrose, or St Ambrose in the Wood, an order of religious, who use the Ambrosian office, and wear an image of that saint engraven on a little plate: in other respects they conform to the rule of the Augustins. See Ambrosian Office and Augustins.\n\nAMBROSIAN OFFICE OF RITE, in Church History, a particular formula of worship in the church of Milan, which takes its name from St Ambrose, who instituted that office in the fourth century. Each church originally had its particular office; and when the Pope, in after times, took upon him to impose the Roman office upon all the western churches, that of Milan sheltered itself under the name and authority of St Ambrose; from which time the Ambrosian ritual has prevailed.\n\nAMBROSIN, in middle-age writers, denotes a coin struck by the lords or dukes of Milan, wherein was represented St Ambrose on horseback, with a whip in his right hand. The occasion of this coinage is said to have been a vision of that saint, who appeared to the Milanese general in 1339, during the time of a battle.\n\nAMBROSINIA. See Botany Index.\n\nAMBROSIUS AURELIANUS, or Aurelius Ambrosius, a famous general of the ancient Britons, of Roman extraction. He was educated at the court of Aldroen of Armorica: who, at the request of the Britons, sent him over with 10,000 men, to assist them against the Saxons, whom Vortigern had invited into Britain. Ambrosius had such success against the Saxons, that the Britons chose him for their king, and compelled Vortigern to give up to him all the western part of the kingdom divided by the Roman highway called Watling-street. Some time after, the Britons being discontented with Vortigern, and having withdrawn their allegiance from him, he retired to a castle in Wales, where being besieged by Ambrosius, and the castle taking fire, he perished in the flames, and left his rival sole monarch of Britain; who now took upon him the imperial purple, after the manner of the Roman emperors. Geoffrey of Monmouth tells us, that Ambrosius built Stonehenge near Salisbury in Wiltshire. Ambrosius, according to this historian, coming to a monastery near Caercaradoc, now Salisbury, where three hundred British lords, massacred by Hengist, lay buried, and resolving to perpetuate the memory of this action, he ordered his workmen to prepare a large quantity of stones and other materials. But having, at the instigation of Tremounus archbishop of Caerleon, consulted the famous Merlin, this magician advised him to send over to Ireland for certain great stones, called eborea gigantum, the giant's dance, placed in a circle on a hill called Killair, which were brought thither by giants from the farthest borders of Africa. A body of forces was accordingly sent into Ireland, under Pendragon, Ambrosius's brother, to fetch these stones; but were opposed in their attempt by Gilliomanus king of the country, who derided the folly of the Britons in undertaking so ridiculous an expedition. Nevertheless, the Britons having vanquished this prince in battle, brought away the stones; and by the direction and affluence of Merlin, who had accompanied them, these wonderful stones, by order of Ambrosius, were placed over the graves of the British lords, and are now what is called Stonehenge. Alexander Mechain celebrates this fable in his poem De divina sapientiae landibus. Polydore Virgil affirms another origin of Stonehenge: he tells us it was erected by the Britons as a monument to their general Ambrosius, on the place where he fell in battle, to perpetuate the memory of his glorious actions and services done to his country. Both these stories are rejected by our best antiquaries; who, however, are by no means agreed as to the true origin of this famous piece of antiquity. See Stonehenge.\n\nAfter the Britons had defeated the Saxons, and obliged them to retire northward, Ambrosius is said to have convened the princes and great men at York, where he gave orders for repairing the churches destroyed by the Saxons, and restoring the exercise of religion to its former lustre. This is confirmed by Matthew of Wellminster; who highly applauds the great zeal of Ambrosius in repairing the churches, encouraging the clergy, and restoring the honour of religion. The Monmouth historian gives this prince a very high character. \"He was a man (says he) of such bravery and courage, that when he was in Gaul no one durst enter the lists with him; for he was sure to unhorse his antagonist, or to break his spear into shivers. He was, moreover, generous in bestowing, careful in performing religious duties, moderate in all things, and more especially abhorred a lie. He was strong on foot, stronger on horseback, and perfectly qualified to command an army.\" The same author tells us he was poisoned at Winchester by one Eopa a Saxon, disguised as a physician, and hired for that purpose by Pafcentius one of the sons of Vortigern: but the generally received opinion is, that he was killed in a battle which he lost in the year 508, against Cerdic, one of the Saxon generals.\n\nAMBRY, a place in which are deposited all utensils necessary for housekeeping. In the ancient abbeys and priories, there was an office under this denomination, wherein were laid up all charities for the poor.\n\nAMBUBAJE, in Roman Antiquity, were immodest women, who came from Syria to Rome, where they lived by prostitution, and by playing on the flute: the word is derived from the Syriac abu, which signifies a flute; although others make it come from am and Bais, because these prostitutes often retired to Baiae. According\nAccording to Cruquius, these women used likewise to sell paint for ornamenting the face, &c.\n\n**AMBULANT**, or **AMBULATORY**. They gave in France the name of Ambulant commissioners to those commissioners, or clerks of the king's farms, who had no fixed office; but visited all the offices within a certain district, to see that nothing was done in them against the king's right and the interest of the farm.\n\nAmbulant is also used to denote those brokers at Amsterdam, or exchange agents, who have not been sworn before the magistrates. They transact brokerage business, but their testimony is not received in the courts of justice.\n\n**AMBULATORY**, a term anciently applied to such courts, &c., as were not fixed to any certain place; but held sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another; in opposition to stationary courts.—The court of parliament was anciently ambulatory; so also were the courts of king's bench, &c.\n\n**AMBURBIUM**, in Roman Antiquity, a procession made by the Romans round the city and pomerium, in which they led a victim, and afterwards sacrificed it, in order to avert some calamity that threatened the city.\n\n**AMBURY**, or **ANBURY**, among Farriers, denotes a tumour, wart, or swelling, which is soft to the touch, and full of blood.\n\nThis disorder of horses is cured by tying a horse-hair very hard about its root: and, when it has fallen off, which commonly happens in about eight days, strewing some powder of verdigris upon the part, to prevent the return of the complaint. If the tumour be so low that nothing can be tied about it, they cut it out with a knife, or else burn it off with a sharp hot iron; and, in finewy parts, where a hot iron is improper, they eat it away with oil of vitriol, or white sulphur.\n\nMany of our farriers boast of a secret which infallibly cures all protuberances of this kind; the preparation of which is this: Take three ounces of green vitriol and one ounce of white arsenic; beat them to a coarse powder, and put them into a crucible; place the crucible in the midst of a charcoal fire, stirring the substance, but carefully avoiding the poisonous fumes: when the whole grows reddish, take the crucible out of the fire, and when cool, break it and take out the matter at the bottom; beat this to powder in a mortar, and add to four ounces of this powder five ounces of album rubris; make the whole into an ointment, and let it be applied cold to warts; rubbing them with it every day. They will by this means fall off gently and easily, without leaving any swellings. It is best to keep the horse quiet, and without working, during the cure. What sores remain on the parts from which the swellings fall off, may be cured with the common application called the countess's ointment.\n\n**AMBUSCADE**, or **AMBUSH**, in the Military Art, properly denotes a place where soldiers may lie concealed till they find an opportunity to surprise the enemy.\n\nIn the language of Scripture, these terms are not always taken in their proper signification, for laying ambushes for any one, attacking him in secret, laying shares for him. They sometimes signify no more than attacking a man who has no distrust of such a thing; attacking one behind, concealing one's self in some particular place in order to surprise any one. See the book of Judges, ch. ix. 25, 32, 34, 35. Abimelech, who lay lurking with his people in the heights of Sichem, so, however, as to rob and treat those who passed that way very ill, came and attacked the city of Sichem with his troops divided into three bodies: \"Tetendit infidias juxta Sichimam in quatuor locis.\" Literally, according to the Hebrew, \"They prepared ambuscades against Sichem in four heads or companies.\" And a little farther, verse 43. \"Abimelech, being informed that the Sichemites had marched, took his army and divided it into three bodies, and laid wait for them in the field.\" It seems certain, that in these parages ambushes, properly so called, were not the things in question. In the first book of Samuel, Saul complains that David laid ambuscades for him: \"Infidiator usque bodie permanentis.\" Now nothing could be worse grounded than this accusation, if we understand the word infidari in its proper signification; but he might say, though unjustly, that David was his secret enemy. And in the Chronicles it is said, that God turned the ambushes laid by the enemies of Israel upon themselves; that is to say, their endeavours, their malice, their arms, he turned against themselves; for the enemies there mentioned came not in private or by stratagem; they marched openly in arms against Israel.\n\n**AMBY**, a town of the Austrian Netherlands, in the province of Limburg, situated opposite to Maastricht, on the east side of the river Maas, in E. Long. 5° 45', N. Lat. 50° 57'.\n\n**AMEDIANS**, in Church History, a congregation of religious in Italy, so called from their professing themselves amantes Deum, \"lovers of God;\" or rather amati Deo, \"beloved of God.\" They wore a gray habit, and wooden shoes, had no breeches, and girt themselves with a cord. They had 28 convents; and were united by Pope Pius V. partly with the Cistercian order, and partly with that of the Scolastici, or wooden shoe wearers.\n\n**AMELIA**, an episcopal city of Italy, in the state of the church, seated on a mountain, in the duchy of Spoleto. E. Long. 13° 20'. N. Lat. 42° 33'.\n\n**AMELIA**, a county in Virginia, situated between the Blue-ridge and the tide waters, having Cumberland county on the north, Prince George county on the east, and Lunenburg county on the south and west. Amelia, including Nottaway, a new county, contains 18,097 inhabitants, of whom 11,037 are slaves.\n\n**AMELIA Ile**, on the coast of East Florida, lies about seven leagues north of St Augustine, and very near Talbot island on the south, at the mouth of St John's river. It is 13 miles long and 2 broad, is very fertile, and has an excellent harbour. Its north end lies opposite Cumberland island, between which and Amelia ile is the entry into St Mary's river, in N. Lat. 30° 52', W. Long. 67° 23'.\n\n**AMELLUS, Starwort.** See Botany Index.\n\n**AMELOT DE LA HOUSSAI**, Nicholas, born at Orleans in 1634, was much esteemed at the court of France, and...\nand appointed secretary of an embassy which that court sent to the commonwealth of Venice, as appears by the title of his Translation of Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent; but he afterwards published writings which gave such offence, that he was imprisoned in the Bastille. The first works he printed were the History of the Government of Venice, and that of the Ulcoks, a people of Croatia. In 1683 he published his translations into French of Machiavel's Prince, and Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent, and Political Discourses of his own upon Tacitus. These performances were well received by the public. He did not prefix his own name to the two last-mentioned works, but concealed himself under that of La Mothe Joffeau. His translation of Father Paul was attacked by the partisans of the pope's unbounded power and authority. In France, however, it met with great success; all the advocates for the liberty of the Gallican church promoting the success of it to the utmost of their power, though at the same time there were three memorials presented to have it suppressed. When the second edition of this translation was published, it was violently attacked by the Abbé St Real, in a letter he wrote to Mr Bayle, dated October 17, 1685. Amelot defended himself in a letter to the same gentleman. In 1684, he printed, at Paris, a French translation of Baltasar Gracián's Oracula Manual, with the title of l'Homme de Cour. In 1686, he printed La Morale de Tacite de la Flatterie; in which work he collected several particular facts and maxims, which represent in a strong light the artifices of court flatterers, and the mischievous effect of their poisonous discourses. Frederick Leonard, a bookseller at Paris, having proposed, in the year 1692, to print a collection of all the treaties of peace between the kings of France and all the other princes of Europe, since the reign of Charles VII. to the year 1690, Amelot published a small volume in duodecimo, containing a preliminary discourse upon these treaties; wherein he endeavours to show, that most princes, when they enter into a treaty, think more how to evade than how to perform the terms they subscribe to. He published also an edition of Cardinal d'Ollat's letters in 1697, with several observations of his own; which, as he tells us in his advertisement, may serve as a supplement to the history of the reigns of Henry III. and Henry IV., kings of France. He wrote several other works; and died at Paris in 1706, at the age of 73. Amelot was at one time confined in the Bastille, probably on account of his political writings.\n\nAMELOTTE Denis, a celebrated French writer, was born at Saintonge in 1606. He maintained a close correspondence with the fathers of the Oratory, a congregation of priests founded by Philip of Neri. He wrote the life of Charles de Gendron, second superior of this congregation, and published it at Paris in 1643. In this work he said something of the famous Abbot of St Cyran, which greatly displeased the gentlemen of Port Royal, who, out of revenge, published a libel against him, entitled Idée générale de l'esprit et de livre de P. Amelotte. He was so much provoked by this satire, that he did all in his power to injure them. They had finished a translation of the New Testament, and were desirous to have it published; for which purpose they endeavoured to procure an approbation from the doctors of the Sorbonne, and a privilege from the king. But Amelotte, by his influence with the chancellor, prevented them from succeeding. In this he had also a view to his own interest; for he was about to publish a translation of his own. Amelotte's translation with annotations, in 4 volumes octavo, was printed in the years 1666, 1667, and 1668. It is not very accurate, according to F. Simon, who tells us that it contains some very gross blunders. Amelotte wrote also an Abridgement of Divinity, a Catechism for the Jubilee, and a kind of Christian Manual for every day. Towards the end of his life, he entered into the congregation of the Oratory in 1650; and continued amongst them till his death, which happened in 1678.\n\nAMEN, εγενόμητε τρεῖς, faithful, certain. It is made use of likewise to affirm any thing, and was a sort of affirmation used often by our Saviour: Amen, ἐγενόμητε τρεῖς, i.e. Vertly, verify, I say unto you. Lastly, It is understood as expressing a wish: as Amen, So be it, (Numb. v. 22.) or an affirmation, Amen, yes I believe it, 1 Cor. xiv. 16. The Hebrews end the five books of Psalms, according to their way of distributing them, with the words Amen, amen; which the Septuagint have translated γένοιτο, γένοιτο; and the Latin, Fiat, fiat. The Greek and Latin churches have preserved this word in their prayers, as well as alleluia and hallelujah; because they observed more energy in them than in any terms which they could use in their own languages. At the conclusion of the public prayers, the people answered with a loud voice, Amen; and St Jerome says, that at Rome, when the people answered Amen, the sound of their voices was like a clap of thunder: In similitudinem celestis tonitruit Amen reboat. The Jews assert, that the gates of heaven are opened to him who answers Amen with all his might.\n\nAMEND, or AMENDE, in the French Customs, a pecuniary punishment imposed by a judge for any crime, false prosecution, or groundless appeal.\n\nAMENDE Honorable, a species of punishment formerly inflicted in France upon traitors, parricides, or sacrilegious persons, in the following manner: The offender being delivered into the hands of the hangman, his shirt is stripped off, a rope put about his neck, and a taper in his hand; then he is led into court, where he must beg pardon of God, the king, the court, and his country. Sometimes the punishment ends here; but sometimes it is only a prelude to death, or banishment to the galleys.\n\nAMENDE Honorable, is a term also used for making recantation in open court, or in presence of the person injured.\n\nAMENDMENT, in a general sense, denotes some alteration or change made in a thing for the better.\n\nAMENDMENT, in Law, the correction of an error committed in a process, which may be amended after judgment, unless the error lies in giving judgment; for in that case it is not amendable, but the party must bring a writ of error. A bill may be amended on the file at any time before the plea is pleaded; but not afterwards, without motion and leave of the court.\n\nAMENDMENT of a Bill, in parliament, is some alteration made in the first draught of it.\n\nAMENTUM, in Botany, the name of a species of calyx, consisting of valves, and hanging down in different\nAmentum, ferent directions from the caulis. Common oats afford\nAmerade, a good example of the amentum.\n\n**AMENTUM**, in Roman Antiquity, a thong tied about\nthe middle of a javelin or dart, and fastened to the fore\nfinger, in order to recover the weapon as soon as it\nwas discharged. The ancients made great use of the\namentum, thinking it helped to enforce the blow. It\nalso denotes a latchet that bound their sandals.\n\n**AMERADE**, a kind of officers among the Sara-\ncens, answering to the governors of provinces among\nthe Europeans. The name is originally the same with\nthat of Emir.\n\n**AMERCEMENT**, or **AMERICIAMENT**, in Law,\na pecuniary punishment imposed on offenders at the mer-\ncy of the court. It differs from a fine in being impos-\ned arbitrarily, in proportion to the fault; whereas a\nfine is a certain punishment settled expressly by some\nstatute.\n\nEND OF THE FIRST VOLUME\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR PLACING THE PLATES OF VOL.
