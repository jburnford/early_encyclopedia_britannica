After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans, he was suffered by Nebuchadnezzar to remain in the defoliate land of Judea to lament the calamities of his infatuated countrymen. He was afterwards, as he himself informs us, carried with his disciple Baruch into Egypt, by Johanan the son of Kareah.\n\nIt appears from several passages that Jeremiah committed his prophecies to writing. In the 36th chapter we are informed, that the prophet was commanded to write upon a roll all the prophecies which he had uttered; and when the roll was destroyed by Jehoiakim the king, Jeremiah dictated the same prophecies to Baruch, who wrote them together with many additional circumstances. The works of Jeremiah extend to the last verse of the 51st chapter; in which we have these words, \"Thus far the words of Jeremiah.\" The 52d chapter was therefore added by some other writer. It is, however, a very important supplement, as it illustrates the accomplishment of Jeremiah's prophecies respecting the fate of Zedekiah.\n\nThe prophecies of Jeremiah are not arranged in the chronological order in which they were delivered. What has occasioned this transposition cannot now be determined. It is generally maintained, that if we consult their dates, they ought to be thus placed:\n\nIn the reign of Josiah the first 12 chapters.\nIn the reign of Jehoiakim, chapters xiii. xx. xxii. v. ii., 14.; xxiii. xxiii. xxv. xxvi. xxxv. xxxvi. xliv.—xlix. i.—33.\nIn the reign of Zedekiah, chap. xxii. i.—10. xxiv. xxvii. xxxiv. xxxvii. xxxix. xlii. 34—39. I. and li.\nUnder the government of Gedaliah, chapters xl. xliiv.\n\nThe prophecies which related to the Gentiles were contained in the 46th and five following chapters, being placed at the end, as in some measure unconnected with the rest. But in some copies of the Septuagint these five chapters follow immediately after the 13th verse of the 25th chapter.\n\nJeremiah, though deficient neither in elegance nor sublimity, must give place in both to Isaiah. Jerome seems to object against him a sort of rusticity of language, no vestige of which Dr Lowth was able to discover. His sentiments, it is true, are not always the most elevated, nor are his periods always neat and compact; but these are faults common to those writers whose principal aim is to excite the gentler affections, and to call forth the tear of sympathy or sorrow. This observation is very strongly exemplified in the Lamentations, where there are the prevailing passions; it is, however, frequently intimated in the prophecies of this author, and most of all in the beginning of the book (i.), which is chiefly poetical. The middle of it is almost entirely historical. The latter part, again, consisting of the last six chapters, is altogether poetical (ii.); it contains several different predictions, which are distinctly marked; and in these the prophet approaches very near the sublimity of Isaiah. On the whole, however, not above half the book of Jeremiah is poetical.\n\nThe book of Lamentations, as we are informed in the title, was composed by Jeremiah. We shall present to our reader an account of this elegiac poem from the elegant pen of Dr Lowth.\n\nThe Lamentations of Jeremiah (for the title is properly and significantly plural) consist of a number of plaintive effusions, composed on the plan of the funeral dirges, all on the same subject, and uttered without connection as they rose in the mind, in a long course of separate stanzas. These have afterwards been put together, and formed into a collection or correspondent whole. If any reader, however, should expect to find in them an artificial and methodical arrangement of the general subject, a regular disposition of the parts, a perfect connection and orderly succession in the matter,\n\n(l) See the whole of chap. ix. chap. xiv. 17, &c. xx. 14—18.\n(m) Chap. xlvii.—li. to ver. 50. Chap. lii. properly belongs to the Lamentations, to which it serves as an exordium.\nScripture, and with all this an uninterrupted series of elegance and correctness, he will really expect what was foreign to the prophet's design. In the character of a mourner, he celebrates in plaintive strains the obsequies of his ruined country: whatever presented itself to his mind in the midst of desolation and misery, whatever struck him as particularly wretched and calamitous, whatever the infant sentiment of sorrow dictated, he pours forth in a kind of spontaneous effusion. He frequently pauses, and, as it were, ruminates upon the same object; frequently varies and illustrates the same thought with different imagery, and a different choice of language; so that the whole bears rather the appearance of an accumulation of corresponding sentiments, than an accurate and connected series of different ideas, arranged in the form of a regular treatise. There is, however, no wild incoherence in the poem; the transitions are easy and elegant.\n\nThe work is divided into five parts: in the first, second, and fourth chapters, the prophet addresses the people in his own person, or introduces Jerusalem as speaking. In the third chapter a chorus of the Jews is represented. In the fifth the whole captive Jews pour forth their united complaints to Almighty God. Each of these five parts is distributed into 22 stanzas, according to the number of the letters of the alphabet. In the first three chapters these stanzas consist of three lines. In the first four chapters the initial letter of each period follows the order of the alphabet; and in the third chapter each verse of the same stanza begins with the same letter. In the fourth chapter all the stanzas are evidently difficult, as also in the fifth, which is not acrostic. The intention of the acrostic was to assist the memory to retain sentences not much connected. It deserves to be remarked, that the verses of the first four chapters are longer by almost one half than Hebrew verses generally are: the length of them seems to be on an average about 12 syllables. The prophet appears to have chosen this measure as being solemn and melancholy.\n\n\"That the subject of the Lamentations is the destruction of the holy city and temple, the overthrow of the state, the extermination of the people; and that these events are described as actually accomplished, and not in the style of prediction merely, must be evident to every reader; though some authors of considerable reputation have imagined this poem to have been composed on the death of King Josiah. The prophet, indeed, has so copiously, so tenderly, and poetically, bewailed the misfortunes of his country, that he seems completely to have fulfilled the office and duty of a mourner. In my opinion, there is not extant any poem which displays such a harpy and splendid selection of imagery in so concentrated a state. What can be more elegant and poetical, than the description of that once flourishing city, lately chief among the nations, sitting in the character of a female, solitary, afflicted, in a state of widowhood, deserted by her friends, betrayed by her dearest connections, imploring relief, and seeking consolation in vain? What a beautiful personification is that of \"the ways of Zion mourning because none are come to her solemn feasts\"? How tender and pathetic are the following complaints?\n\nIs this nothing to all you who pass along the way? behold and see,\n\nIf there be any sorrow, like unto my sorrow, which is inflicted on me;\nWhich Jehovah inflicted on me in the day of the violence of his wrath.\nFor these things I weep, my eyes stream with water;\nBecause the comforter is far away, that should tranquillize my soul:\nMy children are defoliate, because the enemy was strong.\nBut to detail its beauties would be to transcribe the entire poem.\"\n\nEzekiel was carried to Babylon as a captive, and received the first revelations from heaven, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim's captivity, A.C. 595. The book of Ezekiel is sometimes distributed under different heads. In the three first chapters the commission of the prophet is described. From the fourth to the thirty-second chapter inclusive, the calamities that befell the enemies of the Jews are predicted, viz. the Ammonites, the Moabites, and Philistines. The ruin of Tyre and of Sidon, and the fall of Egypt, are particularly foretold; prophecies which have been fulfilled in the most literal and astonishing manner, as we have been often assured by the relation of historians and travellers. From the 32nd chapter to the 40th he inveighs against the hypocrisy and murmuring spirit of his countrymen, admonishing them to resignation by promises of deliverance. In the 38th and 39th chapters he undoubtedly predicts the final return of the Jews from their dispersion in the latter days, but in a language so obscure that it cannot be understood till the event take place. The nine last chapters of this book furnish the description of a very remarkable vision of a new temple and city, of a new religion and polity.\n\n\"Ezekiel is much inferior to Jeremiah in elegance; character in sublimity he is not even excelled by Isaiah; but his as a writability is of a totally different kind. He is deep, vehement, tragical; the only sensation he affects to excite is the terrible; his sentiments are elevated, fervid, full of fire, indignant; his imagery is crowded, magnificent, terrific, sometimes almost to disgust: his language is pompous, solemn, austere, rough, and at times unpolished: he employs frequent repetitions, not for the sake of grace or elegance, but from the vehemence of passion and indignation. Whatever subject he treats of, that he sedulously pursues, from that he rarely departs, but cleaves as it were to it; whence the connection is in general evident and well preserved. In many respects he is perhaps excelled by the other prophets; but in that species of composition to which he seems by nature adapted, the forcible, the impetuous, the great and solemn, not one of the sacred writers is superior to him. His diction is sufficiently perspicuous; all his obscurity consists in the nature of the subject. Visions (as for instance, among others, those of Hosea, Amos, and Jeremiah) are necessarily dark and confused. The greater part of Ezekiel, towards the middle of the book especially, is poetical, whether we regard the matter or the diction. His periods, however, are frequently so rude and incompact, that I am often at a loss how to pronounce concerning his performance in this respect.\n\n\"Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as far as relates to style, may be said to hold the same rank among the Hebrews, as Homer, Simonides, and Aeschylus among the Greeks.\"\nSo full an account of Daniel and his writings has been already given under the article DANIEL, that little remains to be said on that subject. Daniel flourished during the successive reigns of several Babylonian and Median kings to the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. The events recorded in the 6th chapter were contemporary with Darius the Mede; but in the 7th and 8th chapters Daniel returns to an earlier period, to relate the visions which he beheld in the three first years of Belshazzar's reign; and those which follow in the four last chapters were revealed to him in the reign of Darius. The last six chapters are composed of prophecies delivered at different times; all of which are in some degree connected as parts of one great scheme. They extend through many ages, and furnish the most striking description of the fall of successive kingdoms, which were to be introductory to the establishment of the Messiah's reign. They characterize in descriptive terms the four great monarchies of the world to be succeeded by \"that kingdom which should not be destroyed.\"\n\nThe whole book of Daniel being no more than a plain relation of facts, partly past and partly future, must be excluded the class of poetical prophecy. Much indeed of the parabolic imagery is introduced in that book; but the author introduces it as a prophet only; as visionary and allegorical symbols of objects and events, totally untinged with the true poetical colouring. The Jews, indeed, would refuse to Daniel even the character of a prophet; but the arguments under which they shelter this opinion are very futile; for those points which they maintain concerning the conditions on which the gift of prophecy is imparted, the different gradations, and the discrimination between the true prophecy and mere inspiration, are all trifling and absurd, without any foundation in the nature of things, and totally destitute of scriptural authority. They add, that Daniel was neither originally educated in the prophetic discipline and precepts, nor afterwards lived conformably to the manner of the prophets. It is not, however, easy to comprehend how this can diminish his claim to a divine mission and inspiration; it may possibly enable us, indeed, to assign a reason for the dissimilarity between the style of Daniel and that of the other prophets, and for its possessing so little of the diction and character of poetry, which the rest seem to have imbibed in common from the schools and discipline in which they were educated.\n\nThe prophecies of Daniel appear so plain and intelligible after their accomplishment, that Porphyry, who wrote in the 3rd century, affirms, that they were written after the events to which they refer took place. A little reflection will show the absurdity of this supposition. Some of the prophecies of Daniel clearly refer to Antiochus Epiphanes, with whose oppressions the Jews were too well acquainted. Had the book of Daniel not made its appearance till after the death of Epiphanes, every Jew who read it must have discovered the forgery. And what motive could induce them to receive it among their sacred books? It is impossible to conceive one. Their character was quite the reverse: their respect for the Scripture had degenerated into superstition. But we are not left to determine this important point from the character of the Jews; we have access to more decisive evidence: we are sure that the book of Daniel contains prophecies, for some of them have been accomplished since the time of Porphyry; particularly those respecting Antichrist: now, if it contains any prophecies, who will take upon him to affirm that the divine Spirit, which dictated these many centuries before they were fulfilled, could not also have delivered prophecies concerning Antiochus Epiphanes?\n\nThe language in which the book of Daniel is composed proves that it was written about the time of the Babylonian captivity. Part of it is pure Hebrew: a language in which none of the Jewish books were composed after the age of Epiphanes. There are arguments to a doubt. To a Christian the internal marks of the book itself will show the time in which it was written, and the testimony of Ezekiel will prove Daniel to be at least his contemporary.\n\nThe twelve minor prophets were so called, not from any supposed inferiority in their writings, but on account of the small size of their works. Perhaps it was for this reason that the Jews joined them together, and considered them as one volume. These 12 prophets presented in scattered hints a lively sketch of many particulars relative to the history of Judah and Israel, as Gray's Key well as of other kingdoms; they prophesy with historic exactness the fate of Babylon, of Nineveh, of Tyre, of Sidon, and of Damascus. The three last prophets especially illustrate many circumstances at a period when the historical pages of Scripture are closed, and when profane writers are entirely wanting. At first the Jewish prophets appeared only as single lights, and followed each other in individual succession; but they became more numerous about the time of the captivity. The light of inspiration was collected into one blaze, previous to its suspension; and it served to keep alive the expectations of the Jews during the awful interval which prevailed between the expiration of prophecy and its grand completion on the advent of Christ.\n\nHosea has been supposed the most ancient of the 12 minor prophets. He flourished in the reign of Jeroboam II, king of Israel, and during the successive reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He was therefore nearly contemporary with Isaiah, Amos, and Jonah. The prophecies of Hosea being scattered through the book without date or connection, cannot with any certainty be chronologically arranged.\n\nHosea is the first in order of the minor prophets, and is perhaps, Jonah excepted, the most ancient of them all. His style exhibits the appearance of very remote antiquity; it is pointed, energetic, and concise. It bears a distinguished mark of poetical composition, in that pristine brevity and condensation which is observable in the sentences, and which later writers have in some measure neglected. This peculiarity has not escaped the observation of Jerome: \"He is altogether (says he, speaking of this prophet) laconic and sententious.\" But this very circumstance, which anciently was supposed no doubt to impart uncommon force and elegance, in the present ruminous state of the Hebrew literature is productive of so much obscurity, that although the general subject of this writer be sufficiently obvious, he is the most difficult and perplexed of all the prophets. There is, however, another reason for the obscurity of his style: Hosea prophesied during the reigns of the four kings of Judah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. The duration of his ministry, therefore, in whatever\never manner we calculate, must include a very considerable space of time. We have now only a small volume of his remaining, which seems to contain his principal prophecies; and these are extant in a continued series, with no marks of distinction as to the times in which they were published, or the subjects of which they treat. There is, therefore, no cause to wonder if, in perusing the prophecies of Hosea, we sometimes find ourselves in a similar predicament with those who consulted the scattered leaves of the Sibyl.\n\nAs a specimen of Hosea's style, we select the following beautiful pathetic passage:\n\nHow shall I resign thee, O Ephraim!\nHow shall I deliver thee up, O Israel!\nHow shall I resign thee as Admah!\nHow shall I make thee as Zeboim!\nMy heart is changed within me;\nI am warmed also with repentance towards thee.\nI will not do according to the fervour of my wrath;\nI will not return to destroy Ephraim:\nFor I am God, and not man;\nHoly in the midst of thee, though I inhabit not thy cities.\n\nConcerning the date of the prophecy of Joel there are various conjectures. The book itself affords nothing by which we can discover when the author lived, or upon what occasion it was written. Joel speaks of a great famine, and of mischiefs that happened in consequence of an inundation of locusts; but nothing can be gathered from such general observations to enable us to fix the period of his prophecy. St Jerome thinks (and it is the general opinion) that Jael was contemporary with Hosea. This is possibly true; but the foundation on which the opinion rests is very precarious, viz. That when there is no proof of the time in which a prophet lived, we are to be guided in our conjectures reflecting it by that of the preceding prophet whose epoch is better known. As this rule is infallible, it therefore ought not to hinder us from adopting any other opinion that comes recommended by good reasons. Father Calmet places him under the reign of Joash, at the same time with Jeremiah, and thinks it probable that the famine to which Joel alludes, is the same with that which Jeremiah predicted, ch. viii. 13.\n\nThe style of Joel is essentially different from that of Hosea; but the general character of his diction, though of a different kind, is not less poetical. He is elegant, perspicuous, copious, and fluent; he is also sublime, animated, and energetic. In the first and second chapters he displays the full force of the prophetic poetry, and shows how naturally it inclines to the use of metaphors, allegories, and comparisons. Nor is the connection of the matter less clear and evident than the complexion of the style: this is exemplified in the display of the impending evils which gave rise to the prophecy, the exhortation to repentance; the promises of happiness and success both terrestrial and eternal to those who become truly penitent; the restoration of the Israelites; and the vengeance to be taken of their adversaries. But while we allow this just commendation to his perspicuity both in language and arrangement, we must not deny that there is sometimes great obscurity observable in his subject, and particularly in the latter part of the prophecy.\n\nThe following prophecy of a plague of locusts is described with great sublimity of expression:\n\nFor a nation hath gone up on my land,\nWho are strong, and without number:\nThey have destroyed my vine, and have made my fig-tree a broken branch.\nThey have made it quite bare, and cast it away: the branches thereof are made white.\nThe field is laid waste; the ground mourneth.\n\nAmos was contemporary with Hosea. They both began to prophesy during the reigns of Uzziah over Judah, and of Jeroboam II. over Israel. Amos saw his first vision two years before the earthquake, which Zechariah informs us happened in the days of Uzziah. See Amos.\n\nAmos was a herdsman of Tekoa, a small town in the territory of Judah, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit. In the simplicity of former times, and in the happy climates of the East, these were not considered as dishonourable occupations. He was no prophet (as he informed Amaziah), neither was he a prophet's son; that is, he had no regular education in the schools of the prophets.\n\nThe prophecies of Amos consist of several distinct discourses, which chiefly respect the kingdom of Israel; yet sometimes the prophet inveighs against Judah, and threatens the adjacent nations, the Syrians, Philistines, Tyrians, Edomites, Ammonites, and Moabites.\n\nJerome calls Amos \"rude in speech, but not in knowledge,\" applying to him what St Paul modestly professed of himself. \"Many (says Dr Lowth) have followed the authority of Jerome in speaking of this prophet, as if he were indeed quite rude, ineloquent, and destitute of all the embellishments of composition. The matter is, however, far otherwise. Let any person who has candour and perspicacity enough to judge, not from the man but from his writings, open the volume of his predictions, and he will, I think, agree with me, that our shepherd is not a whit behind the very chief of the prophets.\" He will agree, that as in sublimity and magnificence he is almost equal to the greatest, so in splendour of diction and elegance of expression he is scarcely inferior to any. The same celestial Spirit indeed actuated Isaiah and Daniel in the court and Amos in the sheep-folds; constantly selecting such interpreters of the divine will as were best adapted to the occasion, and sometimes \"from the mouth of babes and sucklings perfecting praise:\" occasionally employing the natural eloquence of some, and occasionally making others eloquent.\"\n\nMr Locke has observed, that the comparisons of this prophet are chiefly drawn from lions and other animals with which he was most accustomed; but the finest images and allusions are drawn from scenes of nature. There are many beautiful passages in the writings of Amos, of which we shall present one specimen:\n\nWo to them that are at ease in Zion,\nAnd trust in the mountains of Samaria;\nWho are named chief of the nations,\nTo whom the house of Israel came:\nPafs ye unto Calneh and see,\nAnd from thence go to Hamath the Great;\nThen go down to Gath of the Philistines;\nAre they better than thee kingdoms?\nOr their borders greater than their borders?\nYe that put far away the evil day,\nAnd cause the feet of violence to come near;\nThat lie upon beds of ivory,\nAnd stretch yourselves upon couches;\nThat eat the lambs out of the flock,\nAnd the calves out of the midst of the stall;\nThat chant to the sound of the viol,\nAnd like David devise instruments of music;\nThat drink wine in bowls,\nAnd anoint yourselves with chief ointments;\nBut are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.\n\nThe writings of Obadiah, which consist of one chapter, are composed with much beauty, and unfold a very interesting scene of prophecy. Of this prophet little can be said, as the specimen of his genius is so short, and the greater part of it included in one of the prophecies of Jeremiah. Compare Ob. 1—9. with Jer. xlix. 14, 15, 16. See OBADIAH.\n\nThough Jonah be placed the fifth in the order of the minor prophets both in the Hebrew and Septuagint, he is generally considered as the most ancient of all the prophets, not excepting Hosea. He lived in the kingdom of Israel, and prophesied to the ten tribes under the reign of Jotham and Jeroboam. The book of Jonah is chiefly historical, and contains nothing of poetry but the prayer of the prophet. The sacred writers, and our Lord himself, speak of Jonah as a prophet of considerable eminence. See JONAH.\n\nMicah began to prophesy soon after Isaiah, Hosea, Joel, and Amos; and he prophesied between A. M. 3246, when Jotham began to reign, and A. M. 3305, Luke xii. 29, when Hezekiah died. One of his predictions is said to have saved the life of Jeremiah, who under the reign of Jehoiakim would have been put to death for prophesying the destruction of the temple, had it not appeared that Micah had foretold the same thing under Hezekiah above 100 years before. Micah is mentioned as a prophet in the book of Jeremiah and in the New Testament. He is imitated by succeeding prophets (N), as he himself had borrowed expressions from his predecessors (O). Our Saviour himself spoke in the language of this prophet (P).\n\nThe style of Micah is for the most part close, forcible, pointed, and concise; sometimes approaching the obscurity of Hosea; in many parts animated and sublime; and in general truly poetical. In his prophecies there is an elegant poem, which Dr Lowth thinks is a citation from the answer of Balaam to the king of the Moabites:\n\nWherewith shall I come before Jehovah?\nWherewith shall I bow myself unto the High God?\nShall I come before him with burnt-offerings,\nWith calves of a year old?\nWill Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams?\nWith ten thousands of rivers of oil?\n\nJosephus asserts, that Nahum lived in the time of Joatham king of Judah; in which case he may be supposed to have prophesied against Nineveh when Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria carried captive the natives of Galilee and other parts about A. M. 3264. It is, however, probable, that his prophecies were delivered in the reign of Hezekiah; for he appears to speak of the taking of No-Ammon a city of Egypt, and of the insolent messengers of Sennacherib, as of things past; and he likewise describes the people of Judah as still in their own country, and desirous of celebrating their festivals.\n\nWhile Jerusalem was threatened by Sennacherib, Nahum promised deliverance to Hezekiah, and predicted that Judah would soon celebrate her solemn feasts secure from invasion, as her enemy would no more disturb her peace. In the second and third chapters Nahum foretells the downfall of the Assyrian empire and the final destruction of Nineveh, which was probably accomplished by the Medes and Babylonians, whose combined forces overpowered the Assyrians by surprise \"while they were folded together as thorns, and while they were drunken as drunkards,\" when the gates of the river were opened, the palace demolished, and an \"over-running flood\" afflicted the conquerors in their devastation; who took an endless store of spoil of gold and silver, making an utter end of the place of Nineveh, of that vast and populous city, whose walls were 100 feet high, and so broad that three chariots could pass abreast. Yet to completely was this celebrated city destroyed, that even in the 2d century the spot on which it stood could not be ascertained, every vestige of it being gone.\n\nIt is impossible to read of the exact accomplishment of the prophetic denunciations against the enemies of the Jews, without reflecting on the astonishing proofs which that nation enjoyed of the divine origin of their religion. From the Babylonish captivity to the time of Christ they had numberless instances of the fulfillment of their prophecies.\n\nThe character of Nahum as a writer is thus described by Dr Lowth: \"None of the minor prophets seem to equal Nahum in boldness, ardour, and sublimity. His prophecy, too, forms a regular and perfect poem; the exordium is not merely magnificent, it is truly majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the description of its downfall and desolation, are expressed in the most vivid colours, and are bold and luminous in the highest degree.\"\n\nAs the prophet Habakkuk makes no mention of the Assyrians, and speaks of the Chaldean invasions as near at hand, he probably lived after the destruction of the Assyrian\n\n---\n\n(n) Compare Zeph. iii. 19, with Micah iv. 7, and Ezek. xxii. 27, with Micah iii. 11.\n(o) Compare Micah iv. 1—3, and Isaiah ii. 2—4. Micah iv. 13, with Isaiah xli. 15.\n(p) Compare Micah viii. 6, with Matt. x. 35, 36.\nScripture. Assyrian empire in the fall of Nineveh A. M. 3392, and not long before the devastation of Judea by Nebuchadnezzar. Habakkuk was then nearly contemporary with Jeremiah, and predicted the same events. A general account of Habakkuk's prophecies has already been given under the word HABAKKUK, which may be consulted. We should, however, farther observe, that the prayer in the third chapter is a most beautiful and perfect ode, poetically all the fire of poetry and the profound reverence of religion.\n\nGod came from Teman,\nAnd the Holy One from Mount Paran:\nHis glory covered the heavens,\nAnd the earth was full of his praise.\nHis brightness was as the light;\nBeams of glory issued from his side;\nAnd there was the hiding of his power.\nBefore him went the pestilence;\nAnd burning coals went forth at his feet.\nHe stood and measured the earth;\nHe beheld and drove asunder the nations;\nThe everlasting mountains were scattered;\nThe perpetual hills did bow.\n\nThe prophet illustrates this subject throughout with equal sublimity; selecting from such an assemblage of miraculous incidents the most noble and important, displaying them in the most splendid colours, and embellishing them with the sublimest imagery, figures, and diction; the dignity of which is so heightened and recommended by the superior elegance of the conclusion, that were it not for a few shades which the hand of time has apparently cast over it in two or three passages, no composition of the kind would appear more elegant or more perfect than this poem.\n\nHabakkuk is imitated by succeeding prophets, and his words are borrowed by the evangelical writers [1].\n\nZephaniah, who was contemporary with Jeremiah, prophesied in the reign of Josiah king of Judah; and from the idolatry which he describes as prevailing at that time, it is probable that his prophecies were delivered before the last reformation made by that pious prince A. M. 3381.\n\nThe account which Zephaniah and Jeremiah give of the idolatries of their age is so similar, that St. Theodore affirms, that Zephaniah abridged the descriptions of Jeremiah. But it is more probable that the prophecies of Zephaniah were written some years before those of his contemporary; for Jeremiah seems to represent the abuses as partly removed which Zephaniah describes as flagrant and excessive (Q).\n\nIn the first chapter Zephaniah denounces the wrath of God against the idolaters who worshipped Baal and the host of heaven, and against the violent and deceitful. In the second chapter the prophet threatens destruction to the Philistines, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and Ethiopians; and describes the fate of Nineveh in emphatic terms: \"Flocks shall lie down in the midst of her; all the beasts of the nations, both the cormorant and bittern, shall lodge in her; their voice shall ring in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresh-\n\n(Ω) Compare Zephaniah i. 4, 5, 9, with Jeremiah ii. 5, 20, 32.\nbe cited by St Matthew (xxvii. 9, 10.) as spoken by Jeremiah; and as the 11th, 12th, and 13th chapters have been thought to contain some particulars more suitable to the age of Jeremiah than to that of Zechariah, some learned writers are of opinion that they were written by the former prophet, and have been from similarity of subject joined by mistake to those of Zechariah. But others are of opinion, that St Matthew might allude to some traditional prophecy of Jeremiah, or what is more probable, that the name of Jeremiah was substituted by mistake in place of Zechariah.\n\nThe 12th, 13th, and 14th chapters contain prophecies which refer entirely to the Christian dispensation; the circumstances attending which he describes with a clearness which indicated their near approach.\n\nThe style of Zechariah is so similar to that of Jeremiah, that the Jews were accustomed to remark that the spirit of Jeremiah had passed into him. He is generally profane till towards the conclusion of his work, when he becomes more elevated and poetical. The whole is beautifully connected by easy transitions, and present and future scenes are blended with the greatest delicacy.\n\nMalachi was the last prophet that flourished under the Jewish dispensation; but neither the time in which he lived, nor any particulars of his history, can now be ascertained. It is even uncertain whether the word Malachi be a proper name, or denote, as the Septuagint have rendered it, his angel (r.), that is, \"the angel of the Lord.\" Origen supposed, that Malachi was an angel incarnate, and not a man. The ancient Hebrews, the Chaldee paraphraat, and St Jerome, are of opinion he was the same person with Ezra; but if this was the case, they ought to have assigned some reason for giving two different names to the same person.\n\nAs it appears from the concurring testimony of all the ancient Jewish and Christian writers, that the light of prophecy expired in Malachi, we may suppose that the termination of his ministry coincided with the accomplishment of the first seven weeks of Daniel's prophecy, which was the period appointed for sealing the vision and prophecy. This, according to Prideaux's account, took place in A.M. 3595; but, according to the calculations of Bishop Lloyd, to A.M. 3607, twelve years later. Whatever reckoning we prefer, it must be allowed that Malachi completed the canon of the Old Testament about 400 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nIt appears certain that Malachi prophesied under Nehemiah, and after Haggai and Zechariah, at a time when great disorders reigned among the priests and people of Judah, which are reproved by Malachi. He inveighs against the priests (i. 6, &c. ii. 1, 2, &c.); he reproaches the people with having taken strange wives (ii. 11.); he reproves them for their inhumanity towards their brethren (ii. 10. iii. 5.); their too frequently divorcing their wives; their neglect of paying their tithes and first-fruits (Mal. iii. 13.). He seems to allude to the covenant that Nehemiah renewed with the Lord (iii. 10. and ii. 4, 5, &c.), assisted by the priests and the chief of the nation. He speaks of the sacrifice of the new law, and of the abolition of those of the old, in these words (i. 10, 11, 12, 13.): \"I have no pleasure in you, faith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Heathen, faith the Lord of hosts.\" He declares that the Lord was weary with the impurity of Israel; and affirms them, that the Lord whom they fought should suddenly come to his temple preceded by the messenger of the covenant, who was to prepare his way; that the Lord when he appeared should purify the sons of Levi from their unrighteousness, and refine them as metal from the dross; and that then the offering of Judah, the spiritual sacrifice of the heart, should be pleasant to the Lord. The prophet, like one who was delivering a last message, denounces destruction against the impenitent in emphatic and alarming words. He encourages those who feared the name of the Lord with the animating promise, that the \"Sun of righteousness should arise with salvation in his rays,\" and render them triumphant over the wicked. And now that prophecy was to cease, and miracles were no more to be performed till the coming of the Messiah; now that the Jews were to be left to the guidance of their own reason, and the written instructions of their prophets—Malachi exhorts them to remember the law of Moses, which the Lord had revealed from Horob for the sake of all Israel. At length he seals up the prophecies of the Old Testament, by predicting the commencement of the new dispensation, which should be ushered in by John the Baptist with the power and spirit of Elijah; who should turn the hearts of fathers and children to repentance; but if his admonitions should be rejected, that the Lord would smite the land with a curse.\n\nThe collection of writings composed after the ascension of Christ, and acknowledged by his followers to be divine, is known in general by the name of New Testament. This title, though neither given by divine command, nor applied to these writings by the apostles, was adopted in a very early age, though the precise time of its introduction is uncertain, it being justified by several passages in Scripture, and warranted by the authority of Matth. St Paul in particular, who calls the sacred books before xxvi. 28. the time of Christ παλαιὰ διάθηκα ἡμῶν. Even long before Gal. iii. 17. Heb. vii. 5. 1 Cor. iii. 15. the five books of Moses, were entitled βεβλοῦσα διάθηκα, or book of the covenant §.\n\nAs the word διάθηκα admits of a two-fold interpretation, we may translate this title either the New Covenant or New Testament. The former translation must be adopted, if respect be had to the texts of Scripture, from which the name is borrowed, since those passages evidently convey the idea of a covenant; and, besides, a being incapable of death can neither have made an old nor make a new testament. It is likewise probable, that the earliest Greek disciples, who made use of this expression, had no other notion in view than that of co-\n\n(r.) Malachi signifies properly my angel.\nScripture. We, on the contrary, are accustomed to give this sacred collection the name of Testament; and since it would be not only improper, but even absurd, to speak of the Testament of God, we commonly understand the Testament of Christ; an explanation which removes but half the difficulty, since the new only, and not the old, had Christ for its testator.\n\nIn stating the evidence for the truth of Christianity, there is nothing more worthy of consideration than the authenticity of the books of the New Testament. This is the foundation on which all other arguments rest; and if it is solid, the Christian religion is fully established. The proofs for the authenticity of the New Testament have this peculiar advantage, that they are plain and simple, and involve no metaphysical subtleties.—Every man who can distinguish truth from falsehood must see their force; and if there are any so blinded by prejudice, or corrupted by licentiousness, as to attempt sophistry to elude them, their sophistry will be easily detected by every man of common understanding, who has read the historical evidence with candour and attention. Instead, therefore, of declaiming against the infidel, we solicit his attention to this subject, convinced, that where truth resides, it will shine with so constant and clear a light, that the combined ingenuity of all the deists since the beginning of the world will never be able to extinguish or to obscure it. If the books of the New Testament are really genuine, opposition will incite the Christian to bring forward the evidence; and thus by the united efforts of the deist and the Christian, the arguments will be stated with all the clearness and accuracy of which they are susceptible in so remarkable a degree.\n\nIt is surprising that the adversaries of Christianity have not always made their first attacks in this quarter; for if they admit that the writings of the New Testament are as ancient as we affirm, and composed by the persons to whom they are ascribed, they must allow, if they reason fairly, that the Christian religion is true.\n\nThe apostles frequently allude in their epistles to the gift of miracles, which they had communicated to the Christian converts by the imposition of hands, in confirmation of the doctrine delivered in their speeches and writings, and sometimes to miracles which they themselves had performed. Now if these epistles are really genuine, it is hardly possible to deny those miracles to be true. The case is here entirely different from that of an historian, who relates extraordinary events in the course of his narrative, since either credulity or an actual intention to deceive may induce him to describe as true a series of falsehoods respecting a foreign land or distant period. Even the Evangelists might an adversary of the Christian religion make this objection: but to write to persons with whom we stand in the nearest connection, “I have not only performed miracles in your presence, but have likewise communicated to you the same extraordinary endowments,” to write in this manner, if nothing of the kind had ever happened, would require such an incredible degree of effrontery, that he who professed it would not only expose himself to the utmost ridicule, but by giving his adversaries the fairest opportunity to detect his imposture, would ruin the cause which he attempted to support.\n\nSt Paul’s First Epistle to the Thessalonians is addressed to a community to which he had preached the gospel only three Sabbath days, when he was forced to quit it by the persecution of the populace. In this epistle he appeals to the miracles which he had performed, and to the gifts of the Holy Spirit which he had communicated. Now, is it possible, without forfeiting all pretensions to common sense, that, in writing to a community which he had lately established, he could speak of miracles performed, and gifts of the Holy Ghost communicated, if no member of the society had seen the one, or received the other?\n\nTo suppose that an impostor could write to the converts or adversaries of the new religion such epistles as these, with a degree of triumph over his opponents, and yet maintain his authority, implies ignorance and stupidity hardly to be believed. Credulous as the Christians have been in later ages, and even so early as the third century, no less severe were they in their inquiries, and guarded against deception, at the introduction of Christianity. This character is given them even by Lucian, a writer of the second century, who vented his satire not only against certain Christians*, who De morte had supplied Peregrinus with the means of subsistence, but also against heathen oracles and pretended wonders. He relates of his impostor (Pseudomantiss) that he attempted nothing supernatural in the presence of the Christians and Epicureans. This Pseudomantis claims before the whole assembly, “Away with the Christians, away with the Epicureans, and let those only remain who believe in the Deity!” (πιστεύοντες τῷ Θεῷ) on which the populace took up stones to drive away the suspicious; while the other philosophers, Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Stoics, as credulous friends and protectors of the cause, were permitted to remain.\n\nIt is readily acknowledged, that the arguments drawn from the authenticity of the New Testament only establish the truth of the miracles performed by our Saviour; yet, if we admit the first three gospels to be genuine, the truth of the Christian religion will be proved from the prophecies of Jesus. For if these gospels were composed by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, at the time in which all the primitive Christians affirm, that is, previous to the destruction of Jerusalem, they must be inspired; for they contain a circumstantial prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, and determine the period at which it was accomplished. Now it was impossible that human sagacity could foresee that event; for when it was predicted nothing was more improbable. The Jews were resolved to avoid an open rebellion, well knowing the greatness of their danger, and submitted to the oppressions of their governors in the hope of obtaining redress from the court of Rome.—The circumstance which gave birth to these misfortunes is so trifling in itself, that independent of its consequences, it would not deserve to be recorded. In the narrow entrance to a synagogue in Caesarea, some person had made an offering of birds merely with a view to irritate the Jews. The insult excited their indignation, and occasioned the shedding of blood. Without this trifling accident, which no human wisdom could foresee even the day before it happened, it is possible that the prophecy of Jesus would never have been fulfilled.\nScripture, fulfilled. But Florus, who was then procurator of Judea, converted this private quarrel into public hostilities, and compelled the Jewish nation to rebel contrary to its wish and resolution, in order to avoid what the Jews had threatened, an impeachment before the Roman emperor for his excessive cruelties. But even after this rebellion had broken out, the destruction of the temple was a very improbable event. It was not the practice of the Romans to destroy the magnificent edifices of the nations which they subdued; and of all the Roman generals, none was more unlikely to demolish so ancient and august a building as Titus Vespasian.\n\nSo important then is the question, Whether the books of the New Testament be genuine? that the arguments which prove their authenticity, prove also the truth of the Christian religion. Let us now consider the evidence which proves the authenticity of the New Testament.\n\nWe receive the books of the New Testament as the genuine works of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul, for the same reason that we receive the writings of Xenophon, of Polybius, of Plutarch, of Caesar, and of Livy. We have the uninterrupted testimony of all ages, and we have no reason to suspect imposition. This argument is much stronger when applied to the books of the New Testament than when applied to any other writings; for they were addressed to large societies, were often read in their presence, and acknowledged by them to be the writings of the apostles.—Whereas, the most eminent profane writings which still remain were addressed only to individuals, or to no persons at all; and we have no authority to affirm that they were read in public; on the contrary, we know that a liberal education was uncommon; books were scarce, and the knowledge of them was confined to a few individuals in every nation.\n\nThe New Testament was read over three quarters of the world, while profane writers were limited to one nation or to one country. An uninterrupted succession of writers from the apostolic ages to the present time quote the sacred writings, or make allusions to them; and these quotations and allusions are made not only by friends but by enemies. This cannot be asserted of even the best classic authors. And it is highly probable, that the translations of the New Testament were made so early as the second century; and in a century or two after, they became very numerous. After this period, it was impossible to forge new writings, or to corrupt the sacred text, unless we can suppose that men of different nations, of different sentiments and different languages, and often exceedingly hostile to one another, should all agree in one forgery. This argument is so strong, that if we deny the authenticity of the New Testament, we may with a thousand times more propriety reject all the other writings in the world; we may even throw aside human testimony itself. But as this subject is of great importance, we shall consider it at more length; and to enable our readers to judge with the greater accuracy, we shall state, from the valuable work of Michaelis, as translated by the judicious and learned Mr Marsh, the reasons which may induce a critic to suspect a work to be spurious.\n\n1. When doubts have been made from its first appearance in the world, whether it proceeded from the author to whom it is ascribed. 2. When the immediate friends of the pretended author, who were able to decide upon the subject, have denied it to be his production. 3. When a long series of years has elapsed after his death, in which the book was unknown, and in which it must unavoidably have been mentioned and quoted, had it really existed. 4. When the style is different from that of his other writings, or, in case no other remain, different from that which might reasonably be expected. 5. When events are recorded which happened later than the time of the pretended author. 6. When opinions are advanced which contradict those he is known to maintain in his other writings. Though this latter argument alone leads to no positive conclusion, since every man is liable to change his opinion, or through forgetfulness to vary in the circumstances of the same relation, of which Josephus, in his Antiquities and War of the Jews, affords a striking example.\n\nBut it cannot be shown that any one doubted of its authenticity in the period in which it first appeared. 1. No ancient accounts are on record whence we may conclude it to be spurious. 2. No considerable period elapsed after the death of the apostles, in which the New Testament was unknown; but, on the contrary, it is mentioned by their very contemporaries, and the accounts of it in the second century are still more numerous. 3. No argument can be brought in its disfavour from the nature of the style, it being exactly such as might be expected from the apostles, not Attic but Jewish Greek. 4. No facts are recorded which happened after their death. 5. No doctrines are maintained which contradict the known tenets of the authors, since, beside the New Testament, no writings of the apostles exist. But, to the honour of the New Testament be it spoken, it contains numerous contradictions to the tenets and doctrines of the fathers in the second and third century, whose morality was different from that of the gospel, which recommends fortitude and submission to unavoidable evils, but not that enthusiastic ardour for martyrdom for which those centuries are distinguished; it alludes to ceremonies which in the following ages were either in disuse or totally unknown; all which circumstances infallibly demonstrate that the New Testament is not a production of either of those centuries.\n\nWe shall now consider the positive evidence for the authenticity of the New Testament. These may be arranged under the three following heads:\n\n1. The impossibility of a forgery, arising from the nature of the thing itself. 2. The ancient Christian, Jewish, and Heathen testimony in its favour. 3. Its own internal evidence.\n\n1. The impossibility of a forgery arising from the nature of the thing itself is evident. It is impossible for any forgery to be established forged writings as authentic in any place where there are persons strongly inclined and well qualified to detect the fraud. Now the Jews were the most violent enemies of Christianity. They put the founder of it to death; they persecuted his disciples with implacable fury; and they were anxious to stifle the new religion in its birth. If the writings of the New Testament had been forged, would not the Jews have detected the imposture? Is there a single instance on record where a few individuals have imposed a history upon the world against\nScripture, against the testimony of a whole nation? Would the inhabitants of Palestine have received the gospels, if they had not had sufficient evidence that Jesus Christ really appeared among them, and performed the miracles ascribed to him? Or would the churches of Rome or Corinth have acknowledged the epistles addressed to them as the genuine works of Paul, if Paul had never preached among them? We might as well think to prove, that the history of the Reformation is the invention of historians; and that no revolution happened in Great Britain during the last century.\n\n2. The second kind of evidence which we produce to prove the authenticity of the New Testament, is the testimony of ancient writers, Christians, Jews, and Heathens.\n\nIn reviewing the evidence of testimony, it will not be expected that we should begin at the present age, and trace backwards the authors who have written on this subject to the first ages of Christianity. This indeed, though a laborious task, could be performed in the most complete manner; the whole series of authors, numerous in every age, who have quoted from the books of the New Testament, written commentaries upon them, translated them into different languages, or who have drawn up a list of them, could be exhibited so as to form such a perfect body of evidence, that we imagine even a jury of deists would find it impossible, upon a deliberate and candid examination, to reject or disbelieve it. We do not, however, suppose that skepticism has yet arrived at so great a height as to render such a tedious and circumstantial evidence necessary. Passing over the intermediate space, therefore, we shall ascend at once to the fourth century, when the evidence for the authenticity of the New Testament was fully established, and trace it back from that period to the age of the apostles. We hope that this method of stating the evidence will appear more natural, and will afford more satisfaction, than that which has been usually adopted.\n\nIt is surely more natural, when we investigate the truth of any fact which depends on a series of testimonies, to begin with those witnesses who lived nearest the present age, and whose characters are best established. In this way we shall learn from themselves the foundation of their belief, and the characters of those from whom they derived it; and thus we ascend till we arrive at its origin. This mode of investigation will give more satisfaction to the deist than the usual way; and we believe no Christian, who is confident of the goodness of his cause, will be unwilling to grant any proper concessions. The deist will thus have an opportunity of examining, separately, what he will consider as the weakest parts of the evidence, those which are exhibited by the earliest Christian writers, consisting of expressions, and not quotations, taken from the New Testament. The Christian, on the other hand, ought to wish, that these apparently weak parts of the evidence were distinctly examined, for they will afford an irrefragable proof that the New Testament was not forged; and should the deist reject the evidence of those early writers, it will be incumbent on him to account for the origin of the Christian religion, which he will find more difficult than to admit the common hypothesis.\n\nIn the fourth century we could produce the testimonies of numerous witnesses to prove that the books of the New Testament existed at that time; but it will be sufficient to mention their names, the time in which they wrote, and the substance of their evidence. This we shall present in a concise form in the following table, which is taken from Jones's New and Full Method of establishing the canon of the New Testament.\n\n| The Names of the Writers | Times in which they lived | The variation or agreement of their catalogues with ours now received | The books in which these catalogues are |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| I.

Canon XLVII. et cap. ult. |\n\nWe now go back to Eusebius, who wrote about the year 315, and whose catalogue of the books of the New Testament we shall mention at more length. \"Let us observe (says he) the writings of the apostle John, which are uncontradicted; and, first of all, must be mentioned, as acknowledged of all, the gospel, according to him, well known to all the churches under heaven.\" The author then proceeds to relate the occasions of writing the gospels, and the reasons for placing St John's last, manifestly speaking of all the four as equal in their authority, and in the certainty of their original. The second passage is taken from a chapter, the title of which is, \"Of the Scriptures universally acknowledged, and of those that are not such.\" Eusebius begins his enumeration in the following manner: \"In the first place, are to be ranked the faceted four Gospels, then the book of the Acts of the Apostles; after that are to be reckoned the epistles of Paul: in the next place, that called the first Epistle of John and the Epistle of Peter are to be esteemed authentic: after this is to be placed, if it be thought fit, the Revelation of John; about which we shall observe the different opinions at proper seasons. Of the controverted, but yet well known or approved by the most, are that called the Epistle of James and that of Jude, the second of Peter, and the second and third of John, whether they were written by the evangelist or by another of the same name.\" He then proceeds to reckon up five others, not in our canon, which he calls in one place spurious, in another controverted; evidently meaning the same thing by these two words (s).\n\nA. D. 290, Victorinus bishop of Pettau in Germany, of Victoria in a commentary upon this text of the Revelation, says: \"The first was like a lion, the second was like a calf, the third like a man, and the fourth like a flying eagle,\" makes out, that by the four creatures are intended the four gospels; and to show the propriety of the symbols, he recites the subject with which each evangelist opens his history. The explication is fanciful, but the testimony positive. He also expressly cites the Acts of the Apostles.\n\nA. D. 230, Cyprian bishop of Carthage gives the following testimony: \"The church (says this father) is watered like Paradise by four rivers, that is, by four gospels.\" The Acts of the Apostles are also frequently quoted by Cyprian under that name, and under the name of the Divine Scriptures.\" In his various writings are such frequent and copious citations of Scripture, as to place this part of the testimony beyond controversy. Nor is there, in the works of this eminent African bishop, one quotation of a spurious or apocryphal Christian writing.\"\n\nA. D. 210, Origen is a most important evidence. Of Origen. Nothing can be more peremptory upon the subject now under\n\n(s) That Eusebius could not intend, by the word rendered spurious, what we at present mean by it, is evident from a clause in this very chapter, where, speaking of the Gospels of Peter and Thomas, and Matthias and some others, he says, \"They are not so much as to be reckoned among the spurious, but are to be rejected as altogether absurd and impious.\" Lard. Cred. vol. viii. p. 98.\nunder consideration, and, from a writer of his learning and information, nothing more satisfactory, than the declaration of Origen, preserved in an extract of his works by Eusebius: \"That the four gospels alone are received without dispute by the whole church of God under heaven;\" to which declaration is immediately subjoined a brief history of the respective authors, to whom they were then, as they are now, ascribed. The sentiments expressed concerning the gospels in all the works of Origen which remain, entirely correspond with the testimony here cited. His attestation to the Acts of the Apostles is no less positive: \"And Luke also once more sounds the trumpet relating the Acts of the Apostles.\" That the Scriptures were then universally read, is plainly affirmed by this writer in a passage in which he is repelling the objections of Celsus, \"That it is not in private books, or such as are read by few only, and those studious persons, but in books read by every body, that it is written, The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by things that are made.\" It is to no purpose to single out quotations of Scripture from such a writer as this. We might as well make a selection of the quotations of Scripture in Dr Clarke's sermons. They are so thickly found in the works of Origen, that Dr Mill says, \"If we had all his works remaining, we should have before us almost the whole text of the Bible.\"\n\nA.D. 194, Tertullian exhibits the number of the gospels then received, the names of the evangelists, and their proper designations, in one short sentence.— \"Among the apostles, John and Matthew teach us the faith; among apostolical men, Luke and Mark refresh it.\" The next passage to be taken from Tertullian affords as complete an attestation to the authenticity of the gospels as can be well imagined. After enumerating the churches which had been founded by Paul at Corinth, in Galatia, at Philippi, Thessalonica, and Ephesus, the church of Rome established by Peter and Paul, and other churches derived from John, he proceeds thus: \"I say then, that with them, but not with them only which are apostolical, but with all who have fellowship with them in the same faith, is that gospel of Luke received from its first publication, which we so zealously maintain;\" and presently afterwards adds, \"The same authority of the apostolical churches will support the other gospels, which we have from them, and according to them, I mean John's and Matthew's, although that likewise which Mark published may be said to be Peter's, whose interpreter Mark was?\" In another place Tertullian affirms, that the three other gospels, as well as St Luke's, were in the hands of the churches from the beginning. This noble testimony proves incontrovertibly the antiquity of the gospels, and that they were universally received; that they were in the hands of all, and had been so from the first. And this evidence appears not more than 150 years after the publication of the books. Dr Lardner observes, \"that there are more and larger quotations of the small volume of the New Testament in this one Christian author, than there are of all the works of Cicero, in writers of all characters, for several ages.\"\n\nA.D. 178, Irenæus was bishop of Lyons, and is mentioned by Tertullian, Eusebius, Jerome, and Photius. In his youth he had been a disciple of Polycarp, who was a disciple of John. He attests of himself and Scripture, his contemporaries, that they were able to reckon up in all the principal churches the succession of bishops to their first institution. His testimony to the four gospels and Acts of the Apostles is express and positive. \"We have not received,\" says Irenæus, \"the knowledge of the way of our salvation by any others than those by whom the gospel has been brought to us. Which gospel they first preached, and afterwards by the will of God, committed to writing, that it might be for time to come the foundation and pillar of our faith. For after that our Lord rose from the dead, and they (the apostles) were endowed from above with the power of the Holy Ghost coming down upon them, they received a perfect knowledge of all things. They then went forth to all the ends of the earth, declaring to men the blessing of heavenly peace, having all of them, and every one alike, the gospel of God. Matthew then, among the Jews, wrote a gospel in their own language, while Peter and Paul were preaching the gospel at Rome, and founding a church there. And after their exit, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, delivered to us in writing the things that had been preached by Peter. And Luke, the companion of Paul, put down in a book the gospel preached by him (Paul). Afterwards John, the disciple of the Lord, who also leaned upon his breast, likewise published a gospel while he dwelt at Ephesus in Asia.\" Irenæus then relates how Matthew begins his gospel, how Mark begins and ends his, and gives the supposed reasons for doing so. He enumerates at length all the passages of Christ's history in Luke, which are not found in any of the other evangelists. He states the particular design with which St John composed his gospel, and accounts for the doctrinal declarations which precede the narrative. If any modern divine should write a book upon the genuineness of the gospels, he could not affect it more expressly, or state their original more distinctly, than Irenæus hath done within little more than 100 years after they were published.\n\nRespecting the book of the Acts of the Apostles, and its author, the testimony of Irenæus is no less explicit. Referring to the account of St Paul's conversion and vocation, in the ninth chapter of that book, \"Nor can they (says he, meaning the parties with whom he argues) show that he is not to be credited, who has related to us the truth with the greatest exactness.\" In another place, he has actually collected the several texts, in which the writer of the history is represented as accompanying St Paul, which led him to exhibit a summary of almost the whole of the last twelve chapters of the book.\n\nAccording to Lardner, Irenæus quotes twelve of Paul's epistles, naming their author; also the first epistle of Peter, the two first epistles of John, and the Revelation. The epistles of Paul which he omits are those addressed to Philemon and the Hebrews. Eusebius says, that he quotes the epistle to the Hebrews, though he does not ascribe it to Paul. The work, however, is lost.\n\nA.D. 172, Tatian, who is spoken of by Clemens of Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, composed a harmony of the four gospels, which he called Diatessaron of the four. This title, as well as the work, is remarkable,\nScripture, markable, because it shows that then as well as now there were four, and only four, gospels in general use among Christians.\n\nA.D. 179, the churches of Lyons and Vienne in France sent an account of the sufferings of their martyrs to the churches of Asia and Phrygia, which has been preserved entire by Eusebius. And what carries in some measure the testimony of these churches to a higher age is, that they had now for their bishop Pontinus, who was 90 years old, and whose early life consequently must have immediately followed the times of the apostles. In this epistle are exact references to the gospels of Luke and John, and to the Acts of the Apostles. The form of reference is the same as in all the preceding articles. That from St John is in these words: \"Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Lord, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth God service.\"\n\nDistinct references are also made to other books, viz. Acts, Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, 1 Timothy, 1 Peter, 1 John, Revelation.\n\nA.D. 149, Justin Martyr composed several books, which are mentioned by his disciple Tatian, by Tertullian, Methodius, Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and Photius. In his writings between 20 and 30 quotations from the gospels and Acts of the Apostles are reckoned up, which are clear, distinct, and copious; if each verse be counted separately, a much greater number; if each expression, still more. Jones, in his book on the Canon of the New Testament, ventures to affirm that he cites the books of which it consists, particularly the four gospels, above 200 times.\n\nWe meet with quotations of three of the gospels within the compass of half a page; \"and in other words, he says, Depart from me into outer darkness, which the Father hath prepared for Satan and his Angels,\" (which is from Matthew xxv. 41.). \"And again he said in other words, I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and venomous beasts, and upon all the power of the enemy.\" (This from Luke x. 19.) \"And, before he was crucified, he said, The son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the Scribes and Pharisees, and be crucified, and rise again the third day.\" (This from Mark viii. 31.)\n\nAll the references in Justin are made without mentioning the author; which proves that these books were perfectly well known, and that there were no other accounts of Christ then extant, or, at least, no others so received and credited as to make it necessary to add any marks of distinction. But although Justin mentions not the authors names, he calls the books Memoirs composed by the Apostles; Memoirs composed by the Apostles and their Companions; which descriptions, the latter especially, exactly suit the titles which the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles now bear.\n\nHe informs us, in his first apology, that the Memoirs of the Apostles, or the writings of the prophets, are read according as the time allows; and, when the reader has ended, the presiding makes a discourse, exhorting to the imitation of such excellent things.\n\nA few short observations will show the value of this testimony. 1. The Memoirs of the Apostles, Justin in another place expressly tells us are what are called gospels. And that they were the gospels which we now use is made certain by Justin's numerous quotations of Scripture, them, and his silence about any others. 2. He describes the general usage of the Christian church. 3. He does not speak of it as recent or newly instituted, but in the terms in which men speak of established customs.\n\nJustin also makes such allusions to the following books as shews that he had read them: Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, Hebrews, 2 Peter; and he affirms the Revelation to John the Apostle of Christ.\n\nA.D. 116, Papias, a hearer of John, and companion of Polycarp, as Irenaeus attests, and of the apostolic age as all agree, in a passage quoted by Eusebius, from a work now lost, expressly affirms the two first gospels to Matthew and Mark; and in a manner which proves that these gospels must have publicly borne the names of these authors at that time, and probably long before; for Papias does not say, that one gospel was written by Matthew, and another by Mark; but, affirming this perfectly well known, he tells us from what materials Mark collected his account, viz. from Peter's preaching, and in what language Matthew wrote, viz. in Hebrew. Whether Papias was well informed in this statement or not, to the point for which this testimony is produced, namely, that these books bore these names at this time, his authority is complete.\n\nPapias himself declares that he received his accounts of Christianity from those who were acquainted with the apostles, and that those accounts which he thus received from the older Christians, and had committed to memory, he inserted in his books. He farther adds, that he was very solicitous to obtain every possible information, especially to learn what the apostles said and preached, valuing such information more than what was written in books.\n\nA.D. 108, Polycarp was the bishop of Smyrna, and disciple of John the Apostle. This testimony concerning Polycarp is given by Irenaeus, who in his youth had seen him. \"I can tell the place,\" faith Irenaeus, \"in c. 38, going out and coming in, and the manner of his life, and the form of his person, and the discourses he made to the people, and how he related his conversation with John and others who had seen the Lord, and how he related their sayings, and what he had heard concerning the Lord, both concerning his miracles and his doctrine, as he had received them from the eye-witnesses of the word of life; all which Polycarp related agreeable to the scriptures.\"\n\nOf Polycarp, whose proximity to the age and country and persons of the apostles is thus attested, we have one undoubted epistle remaining; which, though a short performance, contains nearly 40 clear allusions to the books of the New Testament. This is strong evidence of the respect which was paid to them by Christians of that age. Amongst these, although the writings of St Paul are more frequently used by Polycarp than other parts of scripture, there are copious allusions to the gospel of St Matthew, some to passages found in the gospels both of Matthew and Luke, and some which more nearly resemble the words in Luke.\n\nHe thus fixes the authority of the Lord's Prayer, and the use of it among Christians. If, therefore, we pray...\nScripture, the Lord to forgive us, we ought also to forgive. And again, With supplication beseeching the all-seeing God not to lead us into temptation.\n\nIn another place, he quotes the words of our Lord: \"But remembering what the Lord said, teaching, Judge not, that ye be not judged. Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\" Supposing Polycarp to have had these words from the books in which we now find them, it is manifest that these books were considered by him, and by his readers, as he thought, as authentic accounts of Christ's discourses; and that this point was incontestable.\n\nHe quotes also the following books, the first of which he attributes to St Paul: 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and makes evident references to others, particularly to Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, 1 Peter, 1 John.\n\nIgnatius, as it is testified by ancient Christian writers, became bishop of Antioch about 37 years after Christ's ascension; and therefore, from his time, and place, and station, it is probable that he had known and conversed with many of the apostles. Epistles of Ignatius are referred to by Polycarp his contemporary. Passages, found in the epistles now extant under his name, are quoted by Irenaeus, A.D. 178, by Origen, A.D. 230; and the occasion of writing them is fully explained by Eusebius and Jerome. What are called the smaller epistles of Ignatius are generally reckoned the same which were read by Irenaeus, Origen, and Eusebius.\n\nThey are admitted as genuine by Vossius, and have been proved to be so by Bishop Pearson with a force of argument which seems to admit of no reply. In these epistles are undoubted allusions to Matt. iii. 15, xi. 16, to John iii. 8; and their venerable author, who often speaks of St Paul in terms of the highest respect, once quotes his epistle to the Ephesians by name.\n\nNear the conclusion of the epistle to the Romans, St Paul, amongst others, sends the following salutation:—\"Salute Apelles, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobus, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.\" Of Hermas, who appears in this catalogue of Roman Christians as contemporary with St Paul, there is a book still remaining, the authenticity of which cannot be disputed. It is called the Shepherd, or Pastor of Hermas. Its antiquity is incontestable, from the quotations of it in Irenaeus, A.D. 178, Clement of Alexandria, A.D. 194, Tertullian, A.D. 200, Origen, A.D. 230. The notes of time extant in the epistle itself agree with its title, and with the testimonies concerning it, which intimate that it was written during the lifetime of Clement. In this piece are tacit allusions to St Matthew's, St Luke's, and St John's gospels; that is to say, there are applications of thoughts and expressions found in these gospels, without citing the place or Scripture, writer from which they were taken. In this form appear in Hermas the confessing and denying of Christ § 1 Matt. x. the parable of the seed sown § 1 the comparison of 32, 33, or Christ's disciples to little children § 1 the saying, \"he that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery § 1\" the singular expression, \"having vii. 3, or received all power from his Father,\" is probably an allusion to Matt. xxviii. 18, and Christ being the \"gate,\" vii. 5, or only way of coming \"to God,\" is a plain allusion to Luke xvi. John xiv. 6. x. 7. 9. There is also a probable allusion to Acts v. 32.\n\nThe Shepherd of Hermas has been considered as a fanciful performance. This, however, is of no importance in the present case. We only adduce it as evidence that the books to which it frequently alludes existed in the first century; and for this purpose it is satisfactory, as its authenticity has never been questioned. However absurd opinions a man may entertain while he retains his understanding, his testimony to a matter of fact will still be received in any court of justice.\n\nA.D. 96, we are in possession of an epistle written by Clement bishop of Rome, whom ancient writers, without any scruple, assert to have been the Clement whom St Paul mentions Philippians iv. 3. \"with Clement also, and other my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.\" This epistle is spoken of by the ancients as an epistle acknowledged by all; and, as Irenaeus well represents its value, \"written by Clement, who had seen the blest apostles and conversed with them, who had the preaching of the apostles still founded in his ears, and their traditions before his eyes.\" It is addressed to the church of Corinth; and what alone may seem a decisive proof of its authenticity, Dionysius bishop of Corinth, about the year 170, i.e., about 80 or 90 years after the epistle was written, bears witness, \"that it had been usually read in that church from ancient times.\" This epistle affords, amongst others, the following valuable passages: \"Especially remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, which he spake, teaching gentleness and long suffering § 3, for thus he said (r), Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven unto you; as you do, so shall it be done unto you; as you give, so shall it be given unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye show kindness, so shall kindness be shown unto you; with what measure ye mete, with the same it shall be measured to you. By this command, and by these rules, let us establish ourselves, that we may always walk obediently to his holy words.\"\n\nAgain, \"Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, for he said, Wo to that man by whom offences come; it were better for him that he had not been born, than that he should offend one of my elect; it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the sea, than that he should offend one of my little ones (u).\" He\n\n(t) \"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy;\" Matt. v. 7. \"Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given unto you;\" Luke vi. 37, 38. \"Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again;\" Matt. vii. 2.\n\n(u) Matt. xviii. 6. \"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were cast into the sea.\" The latter part of the passage\nHe ascribes the first epistle to the Corinthians to Paul, and makes such allusions to the following books as are sufficient to show that he had seen and read them: Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, 1 Peter, 2 Peter.\n\nIt may be said, as Clement has not mentioned the books by name from which we infer these allusions or references are made, it is uncertain whether he refers to any books, or whether he received these expressions from the discourses and conversation of the apostles. Mr Paley has given a very satisfactory answer to this objection: 1st, That Clement, in the very same manner, namely, without any mark of reference, uses a passage now found in the epistle to the Romans; 2ndly, that passage, from the peculiarity of the words that compose it, and from their order, it is manifest that he must have taken from the epistle. The same remark may be applied to some very singular sentiments in the epistle to the Hebrews. Secondly, That there are many sentences of St Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, to be found in Clement's epistle, without any sign of quotation, which yet certainly are quotations; because it appears that Clement had St Paul's epistle before him; for in one place he mentions it in terms too express to leave us in any doubt. \"Take into your hands the epistle of the blessed apostle Paul.\" Thirdly, That this method of adopting words of scripture, without reference or acknowledgement, was a method in general use amongst the most ancient Christian writers. These analogies not only repel the objection, but cast the presumption on the other side; and afford a considerable degree of positive proof, that the words in question have been borrowed from the places of scripture in which we now find them. But take it, if you will, the other way, that Clement had heard these words from the apostles or first teachers of Christianity; with respect to the precise point of our argument, viz. that the scriptures contain what the apostles taught, this supposition may serve almost as well.\n\nWe have now traced the evidence to the times of the apostles; but we have not been anxious to draw it out to a great length, by introducing every thing. On the contrary, we have been careful to render it as concise as possible, that its force might be discerned at a glance. The evidence which has been stated is of two kinds. Till the time of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus it consists chiefly of allusions, references, and expressions, borrowed from the books of the New Testament, without mentioning them by name. After the time of Irenaeus it became usual to cite the sacred books, and mention the authors from whom the citations were taken.\n\nThe first species of evidence will perhaps appear to some exceptionable; but it must be remembered that it was usual among the ancient Christians as well as Jews to adumbrate the expressions of Scripture without naming the authors. Why they did so is not necessary to inquire. The only point of importance to be determined is, whether these references are a sufficient proof of the existence of the books to which they allude? Scripture. This, we presume, will not be denied; especially in the present age, when it is so common to charge an author with plagiarism if he happen to fall upon the same train of ideas, or express himself in a similar manner with authors who have written before him. We may farther affirm, that these tacit references afford a complete proof that those ancient writers had no intention of imposing a forgery upon the world. They prove the existence of the Christian religion and of the apostolical writings, without showing any suspicious earnestness that men should believe them. Had these books been forged, those who wished to pass them upon the world would have been at more pains than the first Christians were to prove their authenticity. They acted the part of honest men; they believed them themselves, and they never imagined that others would suspect their truth.\n\nIt is a consideration of great importance, in reviewing the evidence which has been now stated, that the witnesses lived in different countries; Clemens flourished at Rome, Polycarp at Smyrna, Justin Martyr in Syria, Irenaeus in France, Tertullian at Carthage, Origen at Alexandria, and Eusebius at Caesarea. This proves that the books of the New Testament were equally well known in distant countries by men who had no intercourse with one another.\n\nThe same thing is proved by testimonies if possible testimony less exceptionable. The ancient heretics, whose opinions of religions were sometimes groser and more impious than those which any modern lector has ventured to broach, and whose zeal in the propagation of them equalled that of the most flaming enthusiasts of the last century, never called in question the authenticity of the books of the New Testament. When they met with any passage in the gospels or epistles which they could not reconcile to their own heretical notions, they either erased it, or denied that the author was inspired; but they nowhere contend that the book in which it stood was not written by the apostle or evangelist whose name it bore. Eusebius relates, that the Ebionites rejected all the epistles of Paul, and called him an apostate, because he departed from the Levitical law; and they adopted as their rule of faith the gospel of St Matthew, though indeed they greatly corrupted it. This proves therefore that the gospel according to Matthew was then published, and that St Paul's epistles were then known.\n\nOf the heretics who erased or altered passages to make the Scriptures agree with their doctrines, we may produce Marcion as an instance, who lived in the beginning of the second century. He lived in an age when he could have easily discovered if the writings of the New Testament had been forged; and as he was much incensed against the orthodox party, if such a forgery had been committed, unquestionably he would not have failed to make the discovery, as it would have afforded the most ample means of revenge and triumph, and enabled him to establish his own opinions with less difficulty. But his whole conduct shows clearly, that he believed the writings of the New Testament to be authentic.\n\nin Clement agrees more exactly with Luke xvii. 2. \"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.\"\nScripture, authentic. He said, that the gospel according to St Matthew, the epistle to the Hebrews, with those of St Peter and St James, as well as the Old Testament in general, were writings not for Christians but for Jews. He published a new edition of the gospel according to Luke, and the first ten epistles of Paul; in which it has been affirmed by Epiphanius, that he altered every passage that contradicted his own opinions: but as many of these alterations are what modern critics call various readings, though we receive the testimony of Epiphanius, we must not rely upon his opinion (x). Hence it is evident that the books of the New Testament above-mentioned did then exist, and were acknowledged to be the works of the authors whose names they bear.\n\nDr Lardner, in his General Review, sums up this head of evidence in the following words: \"Noetus, Paul of Samotata, Sabellius, Marcellus, Photinus, the Novatians, Donatists, Manicheans (Y), Priscillianists, beside Artemon, the Audians, the Arians, and divers others, all received most or all the same books of the New Testament which the Catholics received; and agreed in a like respect for them as written by apostles or their disciples and companions.\"\n\nCelsus and Porphyry, both enemies of the Christian religion, are powerful witnesses for the antiquity of the New Testament. Celsus, who lived towards the end of the second century, not only mentions by name, but quotes passages from the books of the New Testament; and that the books to which he refers were no other than our present gospels, is evident from the allusions to various passages still found in them. Celsus takes notice of the genealogies, which fixes two of these gospels; of the precepts, Refuse not him that injures you, and, If a man strike thee on the one cheek, offer to him the other also; of the woes denounced by Christ; of his predictions; of his saying, that it is impossible to serve two masters; of the purple robe, the crown of thorns, and the reed which was put into the hand of Jesus; of the blood that flowed from his body upon the cross, a circumstance which is recorded only by John; and (what is in fact omnium for the purpose for which we produce it) of the difference in the accounts given of the resurrection by the evangelists, some mentioning two angels at the sepulchre, others only one.\n\nIt is extremely material to remark, that Celsus not only perpetually referred to the accounts of Christ contained in the four gospels, but that he referred to no other accounts; that he founded none of his objections to Christianity on anything delivered in spurious gospels.\n\nThe testimony of Porphyry is still more important than that of Celsus. He was born in the year 213, of Tyrian origin. Unfortunately for the present age, says Michaelis, the mistaken zeal of the Christian emperors has banished his writings from the world; and every real friend of our religion would gladly give the works of one of the pious fathers to rescue those of Porphyry from the flames. But Mr Marsh, the learned and judicious translator of Michaelis, relates, that, according to the accounts of Isaac Vossius, a manuscript of the works of Porphyry is preserved in the Medicean library at Florence, but kept so secret that no one is permitted to see it. It is universally allowed, that Porphyry is the most sensible, as well as the most severe, adversary of the Christian religion that antiquity can produce. He was versed not only in history, but also in philosophy and politics. His acquaintance with the Christians was not confined to a single country; for he had conversed with them in Tyre, in Sicily, and in Rome. Enabled by his birth to study the Syriac as well as the Greek authors, he was of all the adversaries to the Christian religion the best qualified to inquire into the authenticity of the sacred writings. He possessed therefore every advantage which natural abilities or a scientific education could afford to discover whether the New Testament was a genuine work of the apostles and evangelists, or whether it was imposed upon the world after the decease of its pretended authors. But no trace of this suspicion is anywhere to be found in his writings. In the fragments which still remain, mention is made of the gospels of St Matthew, St Mark, and St John, the Acts of the Apostles, and the epistle to the Galatians; and it clearly appears from the very objections of Porphyry, that the books to which he alludes were the same which we possess at present. Thus he objects to the repetition of a generation in St Matthew's genealogy; to Matthew's call; to the quotation of a text from Isaiah, which is found in a psalm ascribed to Asaph; to the calling of the lake of Tiberias a sea; to the expression in St Matthew, \"the abomination of desolation;\" to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text \"the voice of one crying in the wilderness,\" Matthew citing it from Isaiah, Mark from the prophets; to John's application of the term Word; to Christ's change of intention about going up to the feast of tabernacles (John vii. 8.); to the judgment denounced by St Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira, which he calls an imprecation of death.\n\nThe instances here alleged serve in some measure to show the nature of Porphyry's objections, and prove that Porphyry had read the gospels with that sort of attention which a writer would employ who regarded them as the depositaries of the religion which he attacked. Beside these specifications, there exists in the writings of ancient Christians general evidence, that the places of Scripture, upon which Porphyry had made remarks, were very numerous.\n\nThe internal evidence to prove the authenticity of the New Testament consists of two parts: The nature of the style, and the coincidence of the New Testament with the history of the times.\n\nThe style of the New Testament is singular, and differs very widely from the style of classical authors. It is full of Hebraisms and Syriams; a circumstance which pious ignorance has considered as a fault, and which, even to late as the present century, it has attempted to remove; not knowing that these very deviations from Grecian purity afford the strongest presumption in its favour: for they prove, that the New Testament was written by men of Hebrew origin, and is therefore a production.\n\n(x) Dr Loeffer has written a learned dissertation to prove that Marcion did not corrupt the sacred writings.\n(y) This must be with an exception, however, of Faustus, who lived so late as the year 384.\nScripture. duetion of the first century. After the death of the first Jewish converts, few of the Jews turned preachers of the gospel; the Christians were generally ignorant of Hebrew, and consequently could not write in the style of the New Testament. After the destruction of Jerusalem and the dispersion of the Jews, their language must have been blended with that of other nations, and their vernacular phraseology almost entirely lost. The language of the early fathers, though not always the purest classic Greek, has no resemblance to that of the New Testament, not even excepting the works of the few who had a knowledge of the Hebrew; as Origen, Epiphanius, and Justin Martyr, the last of whom being a native of Palestine, might have written in a style similar to that of the New Testament, had such a style then prevailed.\n\nHe that supposes the New Testament to be the forgery of a more recent period, ought to produce some person who has employed a similar diction; but those who are conversant with eastern writings know well that a foreigner, who has not been accustomed to eastern manners and modes of thinking from his infancy, can never imitate with success the oriental style, much less forge a history or an epistle which contains a thousand incidental allusions, which nothing but truth could suggest. To imitate closely the style of the New Testament is even more difficult than to imitate that of any other oriental book; for there is not a single author, even among the Jews themselves, since the destruction of Jerusalem, that has composed in a style in the least degree like it (z).\n\nBut though the books of the New Testament bear so close a resemblance in idiom, there is a diversity of style which shows them to be the work of different persons. Whoever reads with attention the epistles of Paul, must be convinced that they were all written by the same author. An equal degree of similarity is to be found between the gospel and the epistle of John. The writings of St John and St Paul exhibit marks of an original genius which no imitation can ever attain. The character of Paul as a writer is drawn with great judgment by Michaelis: \"His mind overflows with sentiment, yet he never loses sight of his principal object, but hurried on by the rapidity of thought, discloses frequently in the middle a conclusion to be made only at the end.\" To a profound knowledge of the Old Testament he joins the acuteness of philosophical wisdom, which he displays in applying and expounding the sacred writings; and his explanations are therefore sometimes new and unexpected, that superficial observers might be tempted to suppose them erroneous. The fire of his genius, and his inattention to style, occasion frequently a twofold obscurity, he being often too concise to be understood except by those to whom he immediately wrote, and not seldom on the other hand too full of his subject, as to produce long and difficult parentheses, and a repetition of the same word even in different senses. With a talent for irony and satire, he unites the most refined sensibility, and tempers the severity of his censures by expressions of tenderness and affection;\n\nVOL. XIX. Part I.\n\n(z) The style of Clemens Romanus may perhaps be an exception. By many eminent critics it has been thought so like to that of the epistle to the Hebrews, as to give room for the opinion that Clement either was the author of that epistle, or was the person who translated it from the Syro-Chaldaic language, in which it was originally composed.\n\nnor does he ever forget in the vehemence of his zeal Scripture, the rules of modesty and decorum. He is a writer, in short, of so singular and wonderful a composition, that it would be difficult to find a rival. That truly sensible and sagacious philosopher Locke was of the same opinion, and contended that St Paul was without an equal.\"\n\nPoems have been forged and ascribed to former ages with some success. Philosophical treatises might be invented which it would be difficult to detect; but there is not a single instance on record where an attempt has been made to forge a history or a long epistle, where the fraud has not been either fully proved, or rendered so suspicious that few are weak enough to believe it. Whoever attempts to forge a history or an epistle in the name of an ancient author, will be in great danger of contradicting the history or the manners of that age, especially if he relate events which are not mentioned in general history, but such as refer to a single city, sect, religion, or school.\n\nThe difficulty of forging such histories as the gospels, and such epistles as those of Paul, cannot be overcome by all the genius, learning, and industry, of any individual or society of men that ever lived. They contain a purer system of ethics than all the ancient philosophers could invent: They discover a candour and modesty unexampled: They exhibit an originality in the character of Jesus, and yet such a consistency as the imagination of our best poets has never reached. Now it is a very remarkable circumstance, that histories written by four different men should preserve such dignity and consistency, though frequently relating different actions of Jesus, and descending to the most minute circumstances in his life. The scene of action is too extensive, and the agreement of facts with the state of the times as represented by other historians is too close, to admit the possibility of forgery.\n\nThe scene of action is not confined to one country, it is successively laid in the greatest cities of the Roman empire; in Rome, in Antioch, in Corinth, in Athens, as well as in Jerusalem and the land of Palestine. Innumerable allusions are made to the manners and opinions of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews; and respecting the Jews, they extend even to the trifles and follies of their schools. Yet after the strictest examination, the New Testament will be found to have a wonderful coincidence and harmony with Josephus, the principal historian of these times, and an enemy of Christianity.\n\nIt has been a question who the soldiers were who are said in the gospel of Luke to have addressed John, the remarkable Baptist in these words, What shall we do? An answer to this question may be found in Josephus*. Herod between the tetrarch of Galilee was engaged in a war with his father-in-law Aretas, a petty king in Arabia Petraea, at about the very time that John was preaching in the wilderness. New Testaments; and the road from Galilee to Arabia running through that wilderness, the soldiers on their march had this interview with the Baptist. A coincidence like this, cap. 5, which feet. 1, 2.\nScripture, which has been overlooked by all the commentators, would not probably be attended to in a forgery.\n\nAnother instance of an agreement no less remarkable we shall quote from the valuable work of Michaelis. It has been a question of some difficulty among the learned, who was the Ananias who commanded St Paul to be smitten on the mouth when he was making his defense before the council in Jerusalem*. Krebs, in his remarks taken from Josephus, has shown him to have been the son of Nebenedi. But if so, how can it be reconciled with chronology, that Ananias was, at that time, called high priest, when it is certain from Josephus that the time of his holding that office was much earlier? And how comes it to pass that St Paul says, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest?\" The sacerdotal garb must have discovered who he was: a jeff would have ill-fitted the gravity of a tribunal; and a falsehood is inconsistent with the character of St Paul.\n\nAll these difficulties vanish as soon as we examine the special history of that period: \"Ananias the son of Nebenedi was high priest at the time that Helena queen of Adiabene supplied the Jews with corn from Egypt during the famine which took place in the fourth year of Claudius, mentioned in the eleventh chapter of the Acts. St Paul therefore, who took a journey to Jerusalem at that period, could not have been ignorant of the elevation of Ananias to that dignity. Soon after the holding of the first council, as it is called, at Jerusalem, Ananias was dispossessed of his office, in consequence of certain acts of violence between the Samaritans and the Jews, and sent prisoner to Rome; but being afterwards released, he returned to Jerusalem. Now from that period he could not be called high priest in the proper sense of the word, though Josephus has sometimes given him the title of aegidus, taken in the more extensive meaning of a priest who had a seat and voice in the Sanhedrim; and Jonathan, though we are not acquainted with the circumstances of his elevation, had been raised in the meantime to the supreme dignity in the Jewish church. Between the death of Jonathan, who was murdered by order of Felix, and the high-priesthood of Ishmael, who was invested with that dignity by Agrippa, elapsed an interval during which the sacerdotal office was vacant. Now it happened precisely in this interval that St Paul was apprehended in Jerusalem: and, the Sanhedrim being destitute of a president, he undertook of his own authority the discharge of that office, which he executed with the greatest tyranny. It is possible therefore that St Paul, who had been only a few days in Jerusalem, might be ignorant that Ananias, who had been dispossessed of the priesthood, had taken upon himself a trust to which he was not entitled; he might therefore very naturally exclaim, \"I wist not, brethren, that he was the high-priest!\" Admitting him on the other hand to have been acquainted with the fact, the expression must be considered as an indirect reproof, and a tacit refusal to recognize usurped authority.\"\n\nCould such a correspondence as this exist between truth and falsehood, between a forgery and an authentic history? or is it credible that these events could be related by any person but a contemporary?\n\nImpressed with the love of truth, and feeling contempt as well as detestation at pious frauds, we hesitate not to acknowledge, that in some particular facts there Scripture is a difference either real or apparent between Josephus and the writers of the New Testament. The objections arising from these differences are of two kinds: 1) Those appearing in the book not to have been written by the author to whom it is ascribed. 2) Such as iftenices would prove that the author was mistaken, and therefore not divinely inspired. To the first class belongs the following objection: St Paul says (2 Cor. xi. 32) overtly that the governor of Damascus was under Aretas the king: but if we are to judge from the 18th book of the Jewish Antiquities, which corresponds with the period of St Paul's journey to Damascus, that city must have belonged at that time to the Romans; and what authority could Aretas, a petty king in Arabia Petraea, have in such a city? In answer to this question, J. G. Hyne, in a dissertation published in 1755, has shown it to be highly probable that Aretas, against whom the Romans, not long before the death of Tiberius, made a declaration of war, which they neglected to put into execution, took the opportunity of seizing Damascus, which had once belonged to his ancestors; an event omitted by Josephus, as forming no part of the Jewish history, and by the Roman historians as being a matter not flattering in itself, and belonging only to a distant province. Secondly, That Aretas was by religion a Jew, a circumstance the more credible, when we reflect that Judaism had been widely propagated in that country, and that even kings in Arabia Felix had recognized the law of Moses. The difficulty then is so far removed, that it ceases to create suspicion against an epistle which has so many evident marks of authenticity; and it is only to be regretted that, in order to place the subject in the clearest point of view, we are not sufficiently acquainted with the particular history of Damascus.\n\nExamples of the second kind are such as, if allowed their full force, might indeed prove a writer not divinely inspired, but could afford no reason to conclude that he was not the author of the writings which bear his name, since mistakes may be committed by the most accurate historian. The chief difficulties of this nature or to his want of authentication do not apply to the writings of Matthew, John, Paul, and Peter. Laying aside the idea of inspiration altogether, let us inquire whether Luke or Josephus be most entitled to credit in those passages where they differ; which of them is most accurate, and which of them had the best opportunities of exploring the truth of the facts which they relate. Now Josephus relates the same story differently in different parts of his works, and is sometimes equally mistaken in them all. We do not recollect to have seen such inconsistencies in the writings of St Luke. Luke knew the characters, and witnessed many of the facts, of which he speaks; and he could receive the best information respecting those facts which were transacted in his absence. Josephus was born A.D. 37, some years after our Saviour's ascension. Now it is a very important observation of Michaelis, that the period of history with which mankind are least acquainted is that which includes the time of their childhood and youth, together with the twenty or thirty years immediately preceding their birth. Concerning the affairs transacted during that period, we are much more liable to fall into mistakes than concerning those\nScripture, those of a remoter age. The reason is, that authentic history never comes down to the period of our birth; our knowledge of the period immediately preceding depends on hearsay; and the events, which pass within the first eighteen or twenty years of our lives, we are too young and heedless to observe with attention. This must have been more remarkably the case in the time of Josephus than at present, where there were neither daily papers nor periodical journals to supply the want of regular annals. There was no historian from whom Josephus could derive any knowledge of the times that immediately preceded his birth. There is a period then of forty or fifty years, in which, even with the most diligent inquiry, he was exposed to error.\n\nWhen we find therefore the relations of Luke and Josephus to different as not to be reconciled, it would be very unfair to determine without any further inquiry in favour of Josephus. Let their character, and works, and situation, be strictly examined; let their testimony be duly weighed and compared; and then let the preference be given to that author who, according to the strictest rules of equity and justice, seems intitled to the highest degree of credit. The decision of a jury, we shall venture to say, would in every instance turn out in favour of Luke.\n\nHaving thus ascertained the authenticity of the books of the New Testament, the next thing to be considered is their inspiration. It is certainly of some importance to know how far the apostles and evangelists were guided in their writings by the immediate influence of the spirit of God; though this knowledge, if attainable, is not equally important with that of the authenticity of these writings. Michaelis indeed affirms, that the divinity of the New Testament may be proved whether we can evince it to be written by immediate inspiration or not. \"The question (says he), whether the books of the New Testament are inspired? is not so important as the question, whether they are genuine? The truth of our religion depends upon the latter, not absolutely on the former. Had the Deity inspired not a single book of the New Testament, but left the apostles and evangelists without any other aid than that of natural abilities to commit what they knew to writing, admitting their works to be authentic, and possessed of a sufficient degree of credibility, the Christian religion would still be well founded. The miracles by which it is confirmed would equally demonstrate its truth, even if the persons who attested them were not inspired, but simply human witnesses; and their divine authority is never presupposed, when we discuss the question of miracles, but merely their credibility as human evidence. If the miracles are true which the evangelists relate, the doctrines of Christ recorded in the gospels are proved to be the infallible oracles of God; and, even if we admit the apostles to be mistaken in certain not essential circumstances, yet as the main points of the religion which Christ commissioned them to preach are so frequently repeated, their epistles would instruct us as well in the tenets of the Christian system, as the works of Macaulay in the philosophy of Newton. It is possible therefore to doubt, and even deny, the inspiration of the New Testament, and yet be fully persuaded of the truth of the Christian religion: and many really entertain these sentiments either publicly or in private, to whom we should render great injustice, if we ranked them in the class of unbelievers.\n\n\"Yet the Christian religion would be attended with difficulty, if our principium cognoscendi rested not on firmer ground; and it might be objected, that sufficient care had not been taken for those whose consciences were tender, and who were anxiously fearful of mistaking the smallest of the divine commands. The chief articles indeed of Christianity are so frequently repeated, both by Christ and his apostles, that even were the New Testament not inspired, we could entertain no doubt of the following doctrines: 'Jesus was the Messiah of the Jews, and an infallible messenger of God: he died for our iniquity; and by the satisfaction made by his death we obtain remission of sins, if on our part be faith and amendment of life: the Levitical law is abolished; and moral precepts, with the ceremonies of Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, are appointed in its stead; after the present follows an everlasting life, in which the virtuous shall be rewarded and the wicked punished, and where Christ himself shall be the Judge.'\n\n\"To the epistles indeed (says Michaelis), inspiration is of real consequence; but with respect to the historical books, viz. the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, we should really be no losers if we abandoned the system of inspiration, and in some respects have a real advantage. We should be no losers, if we considered the apostles in historical facts as merely human witnesses, as Christ himself has done in saying, 'Ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.' And no one that attempts to convince an unbeliever of the truth of Christianity, would begin his demonstration by presupposing a doctrine which his adversary denies, but would ground his arguments on the credibility of the evangelists as human historians, for the truth of the miracles, the death, and the resurrection of Christ. Even those who examine the grounds of their faith for their own private conviction, must treat the evangelists as human evidence; since it would be arguing in a circle to conclude that the facts recorded in the gospels are true, because they are inspired, when we conclude the Scriptures to be inspired in consequence of their contents. In these cases, then, we are obliged to consider the evangelists as human evidence; and it would be no detriment to the Christian cause to consider them at all times as such in matters of historical fact. We find it nowhere expressly recorded that the public transactions which the apostles knew by their own experience, and of which St Luke informed himself by diligent inquiry, should be particular objects of divine inspiration. We should even be considerable gainers, in adjusting the harmony of the gospels, if we were permitted to suppose that some one of the evangelists had committed an immaterial error, and that St John has rectified some trifling mistakes in the preceding gospels. The most dangerous objections which can be made to the truth of our religion, and such as are most difficult to answer, are those drawn from the different relations of the four evangelists.\"\n\nBefore any inquiry is made respecting the inspiration of the books of the New Testament, it is necessary to determine the meaning of the term; for theologians have given to it a variety of significations. Most of the German divines make it to consist in an infusion of words.\nScripture, words as well as ideas. Luther, Beza, and Salmasius restrict it to ideas alone. Doddridge understands by it an intervention of the Deity, by which the natural faculties of the mind were directed to the discovery of truth. Warburton and Law think it was a negative intervention to preserve the sacred writers from essential errors. Some believe every circumstance was dictated by the Holy Ghost; others suppose that no supernatural assistance was granted except in the epistolary writings.\n\nSee Inspiration.\n\nAs there is an evident distinction between inspiration and revelation, and as the origin of the Christian religion may be still proved divine, even though it were denied that those who record its facts and doctrines were inspired in the act of writing, it will be most judicious and safe to employ the word inspiration in that sense which can be most easily defended and supported. By doing this, much may be gained and nothing lost. It is difficult to prove a doubt that the words of Scripture are divine, because he fees that every writer has words and phrases peculiar to himself. It is difficult also to prove that the ideas were infused into the mind of the authors while they were engaged in the act of writing; because concerning facts they appeal not to divine inspiration, but declare what they have seen and heard. In reasoning they add their own sentiments to what they had received from the Lord, and subjoin, especially in their epistles, things not connected with religion. The definition which Doddridge gives, seems applicable to ordinary gifts or the usual endowments of rational creatures, rather than to the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, which were bestowed on the apostles. Those who maintain that every fact or circumstance was suggested by divine inspiration, will find it no easy matter to prove their position. The opinion of Warburton and Law, with proper explanations, seems most probable. The opinion of Grotius, that only the epistles were inspired, may be easily refuted.\n\nThe proof of the authenticity of the New Testament depends on human testimony: the proof of its inspiration is derived from the declaration of inspired persons.\n\nIn proving that the New Testament is inspired, we presuppose its authenticity, that the sacred books were written by the apostles whose names they bear, and that they have been conveyed to us pure and uncorrupted. This we have already attempted to prove, and we hope with success. The evidence of inspiration is the testimony of Christ and his apostles, which we receive as credible, because they confirmed their doctrines by miracles. From the important mission of Christ and his apostles, we infer that every power was bestowed which divine wisdom thought expedient; and from their conduct we conclude, that it is morally impossible that they could lay claim to any powers which they did not possess. It is proper therefore to inquire into the declarations of Christ and his apostles concerning the nature, degree, and extent, of the inspiration bestowed on the writers of the sacred books.\n\nIf we consider Christ's more immediate promises of inspiration to the apostles, we shall find that he has given them, in the most proper sense of the word, at three several periods, i.e., When he sent the apostles to preach the gospel; 2dly, In holding a public discourse relating to the gospel, at which were present a considerable multitude; 3dly, In his prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem. When he sent the apostles to preach the gospel, he thus addressed them: \"When ye deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak; for it is not you that speak, but the spirit of your father that speaketh in you.\" The same promise was made almost in the same words in the presence of an immense multitude (Luke xii. 11, 12). From these passages it has been urged, that if the apostles were to be inspired in the presence of magistrates in delivering speeches, which were soon to be forgotten, it is surely reasonable to conclude that they would be inspired when they were to compose a standard of faith for the use of all future generations of Christians. If this conclusion be fairly deduced, it would follow that the writings of the New Testament are the dictates of inspiration, not only in the doctrines and precepts, but in the very words. But it is a conclusion to which sincere Christians have made objections; for, say they, though Christ promises to assist his apostles in cases of great emergency, where their own prudence and fortitude could not be sufficient, it does not follow that he would dictate to them those facts which they knew already, or those reasonings which their own calm reflection might supply. Besides, say they, if the New Testament was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and only penned by the apostles, what reason can be given for the care with which Christ instructed them both during his ministry and after his crucifixion in those things pertaining to the kingdom of God?\n\nIn answer to this, we may observe, that though it be proper idea difficult to prove that the identical words of the New Testament were dictated by the Holy Spirit, or the train of ideas infused into the minds of the sacred writers, there is one species of inspiration to which the New Testament has an undoubted claim. It is this, that the memories of the apostles were strengthened and their understandings preserved from falling into essential errors. This we prove from these words of our Saviour, \"and I will pray the Father, and he will give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you.\" John xiv. This promise was surely not restrained to the day of Pentecost: it must have been a permanent gift, enabling the apostles at all times to remember with accuracy the discourses of our Saviour. When the apostles therefore (Matthew and John) relate those precepts of Christ which they themselves had heard, they write indeed from memory, but under the protection of the spirit who secures them from the danger of mistake: and we must of course conclude that their gospels are inspired.\n\nWere we called upon more particularly to declare what parts of the New Testament we believe to be inspired, we would answer, The doctrines, the precepts, and the prophecies, every thing essential to the Christian religion. As to the events, the memory of the apostles was sufficient to retain them. If this opinion be just, it would enable us to account for the discrepancies between the sacred writers, which are chiefly confined to the relation of facts and events.\n\nAll the books of the New Testament were originally written in Greek, except the Gospel according to Matthew.\nScripture, they and the epistle to the Hebrews, which there is reason to believe were composed in the Syro-Chaldaic language, which in the New Testament is called Hebrew.\n\nVarious reasons have been assigned why the greatest part of the New Testament was written in Greek; but the true reason is this, It was the language best understood both by writers and readers. Had St Paul written to a community in the Roman province of Africa, he might have written perhaps in Latin; but epistles to the inhabitants of Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, and Thessalonica, to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, from a native of Tarus, could hardly be expected in any other language than Greek. The same may be said of the epistles of St Peter, which are addressed to the Christians of different countries, who had no other language in common than the Greek; and likewise of the epistles of St James, who wrote to Jews, that lived at a distance from Palestine, and were ignorant of Hebrew. The native language of St Luke, as well as of Theophilus, to whom he addressed his gospel, and Acts of the apostles, appears to have been Greek; and that St John wrote his gospel in that language, and not in Hebrew, is by no means a matter of surprise, since he wrote at Ephesus.\n\nWith respect to the epistle to the Romans, it may be asked indeed why St Paul did not write in Latin? Now, whoever proposes this question, must presuppose that St Paul was master of the Latin language in such a degree as to find no difficulty in writing it; a matter which remains to be proved. It is very probable that St Paul was acquainted with the Latin; but between understanding a language, and being able to write it, there is a very material difference. As St Paul was a native of Tarus, his native language was Greek; he had travelled during several years through countries in which no other language was spoken, and when he addressed the Roman centurion at Jerusalem, he spoke not Latin, but Greek. Is it extraordinary, then, that in writing to the inhabitants of Rome he should have used a language which was so generally understood? It has been long remarked, that Greek was at that time as well known in Rome as French in any court of modern Europe; that according to Juvenal even the female sex made use of Greek as the language of familiarity and passion; and that in letters of friendship Greek words and phrases were introduced with greater freedom than French expressions in German letters, as appears from Cicero's epistles to Atticus, and from those of Augustus preserved in the works of Suetonius. To this must be added a material circumstance, that a great part of the Roman Christians consisted of native Jews, who were better acquainted with Greek than with Latin, as either they themselves or their ancestors had come from Greece, Asia Minor, or Egypt, in which Greek was the language of the country. At least they read the Bible in that language, as no Latin translation of the Old Testament at that time existed; and the Christian church at that period consisting chiefly of Jews, the heathen converts in Rome were of course under the necessity of accustoming themselves to the Greek language. In short, St Paul in his epistle to the Romans made use of a language in which alone those who were ignorant of Hebrew could read the Bible. What has been here advanced respecting the epistle to the Romans is equally applicable to the Greek Scripture of St Mark, on the supposition that it was written at Rome.\n\nTo the above arguments may be added the example of Josephus, who, as well as the apostles, was by birth a Jew. He even lived in Rome, which is more than can be said of St Paul and St Mark, who resided there only a certain time; he was likewise younger than either; he came to Italy at an age which is highly suitable to the learning of a language, and previous to that period had spent several years in the Roman camp. The Jewish antiquities, the history of the Jewish war, and the account of his own life, he wrote undoubtedly with a view of their being read by the Romans; and yet he composed all these writings in Greek. He expresses his motive for writing his Greek account of the Jewish war in the following terms: \"That having written in his native language (i.e., the Hebrew dialect at that time spoken) a history of the war, in order that Parthians, Babylonians, Arabians, Adiabenes, and the Jews beyond the Euphrates, might be informed of those events, he was now resolved to write for the Greeks and Romans, who had not been engaged in the campaigns, a more certain account than had hitherto been given.\" The motives which induced Josephus to write in Greek are fully as applicable to St Paul and St Mark.\n\nMichaelis has thus characterized the style of the New Testament. \"The New Testament (says he) was written in a language at that time common among the Jews, which may be named Hebraic Greek; the first traces of which we find in the translation of the LXX.\"\n\n\"Every man acquainted with the Greek language, is full of who had never heard of the New Testament, must immediately perceive, on reading only a few lines, that the style is widely different from that of the classic authors. We find this character in all the books of the New Testament in a greater or less degree, but we must not therefore conclude that they possess an uniformity of style. The heaviest Hebraisms, which extended even to grammatical errors in the government of cases, are the distinguishing marks of the book of Revelation; but they are accompanied with tokens of genius and poetical enthusiasm of which every reader must be sensible who has taste and feeling. There is no translation of it which is not read with pleasure even in the days of childhood; and the very faults of grammar are so happily placed as to produce an agreeable effect. The gospels of St Matthew and St Mark have strong marks of this Hebraic style; the former has harsher Hebraisms than the latter, the fault of which may be ascribed to the Greek translator, who has made too literal a version, and yet the gospel of St Mark is written in worse language, and in a manner that is less agreeable. The epistles of St James and St Jude are somewhat better; but even these are full of Hebraisms, and betray in other respects a certain Hebrew tone. St Luke has in several passages written pure and classic Greek, of which the first four verses of his gospel may be given as an instance: in the sequel, where he describes the actions of Christ, he has very harsh Hebraisms, yet the style is more agreeable than that of St Matthew or St Mark. In the Acts of the apostles he is not free from Hebraisms, which he seems to have never studiously avoided; but his periods are more classically tuned, and sometimes possess beauty.\nbeauty devoid of art. St John has numerous, though not uncouth, Hebraisms both in his gospel and epistles; but he has written in a smooth and flowing language, and surpasses all the Jewish writers in the excellence of narrative. St Paul again is entirely different from them all; his style is indeed neglected and full of Hebraisms, but he has avoided the concise and verse-like construction of the Hebrew language, and has upon the whole a considerable share of the roundness of Grecian composition. It is evident that he was as perfectly acquainted with the Greek manner of expression as with the Hebrew, and he has introduced them alternately, as either the one or the other suggested itself the first, or was the best approved.\"\n\nMichaelis has shown that the New Testament not only contains Hebraisms but Rabbiniisms, Syriacisms, Chaldaicisms, Arabicisms, Latinisms, and Persian words, of which he has exhibited many specimens. To theologians, whose duty it certainly is to study the language of the New Testament with attention, we would strenuously recommend the perusal of this work, which in the English translation is one of the most valuable acquisitions to scriptural criticism that has yet appeared. We speak of the English translation, which the large and judicious notes of Mr Marsh has rendered infinitely superior to the original.\n\nTo the observations which have been made respecting the language of the New Testament, a few remarks may be added concerning the peculiarities of the style and manner of the sacred writers, particularly the historians. These remarks extend to the Old Testament as well as to the New.—The first quality for which the sacred history is remarkable is simplicity in the structure of the sentences. The first five verses of Genesis furnish an example, which consist of eleven sentences. The substantives are not attended by adjectives, nor the verbs by adverbs, no synonyms, no superlatives, no effort at expressing things in a bold, emphatical, or uncommon manner.\n\n2. The second quality is simplicity of sentiment, particularly in the Pentateuch, arising from the very nature of the early and unenlightened state of society about which that book is concerned.\n\n3. Simplicity of design. The subject of the narrative to engrosses the attention of the writer, that he himself is as nobody. He introduces nothing as from himself, no remarks, doubts, conjectures, or reasonings. Our Lord's biographers particularly excel in this quality. This quality of style we meet with in Xenophon and Caesar.\n\nThe Evangelists may be ranked next to Genesis for simplicity of composition in the sentences. John and Matthew are distinguished for it more than Mark and Luke. But the sentiment is not so remarkable for simplicity in the Evangelist as the Pentateuch. The reasons of this difference are, the state of the Jews was totally changed; their manners, customs, &c., split into factions both in religion and politics. 2. The object of our Lord's ministry, which is the great subject of the gospels, was to inculcate a doctrine and morality with which none of their systems perfectly coincided: besides, being constantly opposed by all the great men, the greater part of his history consists of instructions and disputes. 3. As it is occupied with what our Saviour said and what he did, this makes two distinctions of style and manner; that of our Saviour, and the sacred penman's. In their own character, they neither explain nor command, promise nor threaten, praise nor blame. They generally omit the names of our Lord's enemies; thus directing our hatred at the vices they committed, not at the persons. They never mention such persons without necessity; which is the case with the high-priest, Pilate, Herod, and Judas: the three first for the chronology, the fourth to do justice to the eleven.\n\nHerodias is indeed mentioned with dishonour; but her crime was a public one. On the other hand, all persons distinguished for any thing virtuous are carefully mentioned, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Zacchaeus, Bartimaeus, Jairus, Lazarus, Mary, and Martha. They record their own faults (Peter's, Thomas's), nor do they make any merit of their confession. In one uniform strain they relate the most signal miracles and most ordinary facts.\n\nFrom the narrative is excluded that quality of style which is called animation. Nothing that discovers passion in the writer or is calculated to excite the passions of the reader. Every thing is directed to mend the heart.\n\nBut in the discourses and dialogues of our Saviour the expression, without losing anything of its simplicity, is often remarkable for spirit and energy. Respecting harmony and smoothness, qualities which only add an external polish to language, they had not the least solicitude.\n\nAs to elegance, there is an elegance which results from the use of such words as are most in use with those who are accounted fine writers, and from such arrangements in the words and clauses as have generally obtained their approbation. This is disclaimed by the sacred authors.\n\nBut there is an elegance of a superior order more nearly connected with the sentiment; and in this sort of elegance they are not deficient. In all the oriental languages great use is made of tropes, especially metaphors. When the metaphors employed bear a strong resemblance, they confer vivacity: if they be borrowed from objects which are naturally agreeable, beautiful, or attractive, they add also elegance. The Evangelists furnish us with many examples of this kind of vivacity and elegance. Our Lord borrows tropes from cornfields, vineyards, gardens, &c.\n\nAs a valuable appendage to this part of our subject, proper we shall subjoin Dr Campbell's method of studying the third books of the New Testament. This we offer to our readers as a beautiful instance of the judicious application of philosophy to sacred studies. It is the same method of discovering truth by analysis and induction, and which was pursued by Sir Isaac Newton with such astonishing success, which since his time has been uniformly practised in natural philosophy, and has been also applied to chemistry, to medicine, to natural history, and to the philosophy of mind, by the ingenious Dr Reid. This is the path of sound philosophy, which can alone lead to the discovery of truth. In following it, our progress may be slow, but it will be sure. If all theologians would readily adhere to it, we might then entertain the pleasing hope of discarding forever those absurd systems of religion which are founded on single passages and detached fragments of scripture, and of establishing opinions and doctrines on a solid foundation.\n\"1. To get acquainted with each writer's style; to observe his manner of composition, both in sentences and paragraphs; to remark the words and phrases peculiar to him, and the peculiar application that he may sometimes make of ordinary words; for there are few of those writers who have not their peculiarities in all the respects now mentioned. This acquaintance with each can be attained only by the frequent and attentive reading of his works in his own language.\n\n\"2. To inquire into the character, the situation, and the office of the writer, the time, the place, and the occasion of his writing, and the people for whose immediate use he originally intended his work. Every one of these particulars will sometimes serve to elucidate expressions otherwise obscure or doubtful. This knowledge may in part be learned from a diligent and reiterated perusal of the book itself, and in part be gathered from what authentic, or at least probable, accounts have been transmitted to us concerning the complements of the canon.\n\n\"3. The last general direction is, to consider the principal scope of the book, and the particulars chiefly observable in the method by which the writer has purposed to execute his design. This direction is particularly applicable to the epistolary writings, especially those of Paul.\n\n\"4. If a particular word or phrase occur, which appears obscure, perhaps unintelligible, the first thing we ought to do, if satisfied that the reading is genuine, is to consult the context, to attend to the manner wherein the term is introduced, whether in a chain of reasoning or in a historical narration, in a description, or included in an exhortation or command. As the conclusion is inferred from the premises, or as from two or more known truths a third unknown or unobserved before may fairly be deduced; so from such attention to the sentence in connection, the import of an expression, in itself obscure or ambiguous, will sometimes with moral certainty be discovered. This, however, will not always answer.\n\n\"5. If it do not, let the second consideration be, whether the term or phrase be one of the writer's peculiarities. If so, it comes naturally to be inquired, what is the acceptation in which he employs it in other places? If the sense cannot be precisely the same in the passage under review, perhaps, by an easy and natural metaphor or other trope, the common acceptation may give rise to one which perfectly suits the passage in question.—Recourse to the other places wherein the word or phrase occurs in the same author is of considerable use, though the term should not be peculiar to him.\n\n\"6. But thirdly, if there should be nothing in the same writer that can enlighten the place, let recourse be had to the parallel passages, if there be any such, in the other sacred writers. By parallel passages, I mean those places, if the difficulty occur in history, wherein the same or a similar story, miracle, or event, is related; if in teaching or reasoning, those parts wherein the same argument or doctrine is treated, or the same parable propounded; and in moral lessons, those wherein the same class of duties is recommended; or, if the difficulty be found in a quotation from the Old Testament, let the parallel passage in the book referred to, both in the original Hebrew, and in the Greek version, be consulted.\n\n\"7. But if in these there be found nothing that can throw light on the expression of which we are in doubt, the fourth recourse is to all the places wherein the word or phrase occurs in the New Testament, and in the Septuagint version of the Old, adding to these the consideration of the import of the Hebrew or Chaldaic word, whole place it occupies, and the extent of signification, of which in different occurrences such Hebrew or Chaldaic term is susceptible.\n\n\"8. Perhaps the term in question is one of those which very rarely occur in the New Testament, or those called ἀπόκρισις λεξιμαχία, only once read in Scripture, and not found at all in the translation of the Seventy. Several such words there are. There is then a necessity, in the fifth place, for recurring to the ordinary acceptation of the term in classical authors. This is one of those cases wherein the interpretation given by the earliest Greek fathers deserves particular notice. In this, however, I limit myself to those comments wherein they give a literal exposition of the sacred text, and do not run into vision and allegory.\n\nThe manuscripts of the New Testament are the natural source from which the genuine readings of the Greek Testament are to be drawn. The printed editions are either copies of more ancient editions, or of manuscripts; and they have no further authority than as they correspond to the manuscripts from which they were originally taken. By manuscripts of the New Testament, we mean those only which were written before the invention of printing. The most ancient of these are lost, and there is no manuscript now extant older than the fifth century. Few contain the whole New Testament; some contain the four gospels; some the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles; and others the book of Revelation. The greatest number are those which contain the first part; those which have the second, or the first and second together, are likewise numerous; but those of the third are extremely few. It must be added also, that in many manuscripts those epistles are omitted whose divine authority was formerly doubted.\n\nThere are many manuscripts which have been examined only for a single text, such as 1 John v. 7, or at least for a very small number. Others have been examined from the beginning to the end, but not completely and in respect of all the readings. A third class consists of such as either have been, or are said to have been, completely and accurately collated. But this requires such philogmatic patience, that we can hardly expect to find in critical catalogues all the various readings which have been only once collated. Wetstein, in collating many manuscripts anew, made discoveries which had entirely escaped the notice of his predecessors. The fourth class consists of such as have been completely and accurately collated more than once; but here also we are in danger of being led into error.—When various readings are transferred from one critical edition to another, as from that of Gregory to Mill's edition, and from the latter to those of Bengel and Wetstein, the manuscripts must sometimes be falsely named, and various readings must frequently be omitted. And as Wetstein has marked by ciphers manuscripts that in former editions had been denoted by their initial letters, he could scarcely avoid substituting, in some cases, one figure instead of another. The fifth class, which is by far the most valuable, consists of such as have\nScripture have been printed word for word, and therefore form an original edition of the Greek Testament. We can boast but of a very few manuscripts of this kind. Hearne printed at Oxford, in 1715, the Acts of the Apostles in Greek and Latin from the Codex Laudianus; Knittel has annexed to his edition of Ulphilas, p. 53—118, a copy of two very ancient fragments preserved in the library of Wolfenbuttel; the one of the four Gospels in general, the other of St Luke and St John. Woide printed in 1786 the Codex Alexandrinus, a manuscript of great antiquity, which shall afterwards be more fully described; and the University of Cambridge has resolved to publish, in a similar manner, the Codex Cant. I. or, as it is sometimes called, the Codex Bezae, the care of which is intrusted to Dr Kipling, a publication which will be thankfully received by every friend to sacred criticism. It was the intention of the Abbé Spoletti, a few years ago, to publish the whole of the celebrated Codex Vaticanus; which would likewise have been a most valuable accession, since a more important manuscript is hardly to be found in all Europe. He delivered for this purpose a memorial to the pope; but the design was not put into execution, either because the pope refused his assent or the abbe abandoned it himself. See the Oriental Bible, vol. xxii. n° 333. and vol. xxiii. n° 348.\n\n\"A very valuable library,\" says Michaelis, \"might be composed of the impressions of ancient manuscripts, which, though too expensive for a private person, should be admitted into every university collection, especially the Alexandrian and Cambridge manuscripts, to which I would add, if it were now possible to procure it, Hearne's edition of the Codex Laudianus. A plan of this sort could be executed only in England, by a private subscription, where a zeal is frequently displayed in literary undertakings that is unknown in other countries; and it were to be wished that the project were begun before length of time has rendered the manuscripts illegible, and the attempt therefore fruitless. Ten thousand pounds would go a great way towards the fulfilling of this request, if the learned themselves did not augment the difficulty of the undertaking, by adding their own critical remarks, and endeavouring thereby to recommend their publications, rather than by presenting to the public a faithful copy of the original. Should posterity be put in possession of faithful impressions of important manuscripts, an acquisition which would render the highest service to sacred criticism, all these editions of the New Testament should be regulated on the same plan as Hearne's edition of the Acts of the Apostles.\" It must be highly flattering to the patriotic spirit of an Englishman to hear the encomiums which learned foreigners have so profusely bestowed on our liberality in supporting works of genius and learning and public utility. The plan which Michaelis proposes to us, in preference to all the other nations in Europe, is noble and magnificent, and would certainly confer immortality on those men who would give it their patronage and affluence.\n\nThere are many ancient manuscripts, especially in Italy, which have never been collated, but lie still unexplored. Here is a field where much remains to be done. See Marini's Notes to Michaelis, vol. ii. p. 643.\n\nMichaelis has given a catalogue of ancient manuscripts, amounting in number to 292, to which he has added a short account of each. In this place we shall confine our observations to the most celebrated, the Alexandrian and Vatican manuscripts, which we have chiefly extracted from Michaelis.\n\nThe Alexandrian manuscript consists of four volumes; the first three of which contain the Old Testament, together with the first Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians, and a fragment of the second. In the New Testament, which alone is the object of our present inquiry, is wanting the beginning as far as Matthew xxv. 6. ἐν τοῖς ἀρχαῖοις ἔγγυσις; likewise from John vi. 50. to viii. 52, and from 2 Cor. iv. 13. to xii. 7. It must likewise be observed, that the Psalms are preceded by the epistle of Athanasius to Marcellinus, and followed by a catalogue, containing those which are to be used in prayer for each hour, both of the day and of the night; also by 14 hymns, partly apocryphal, partly biblical, the 11th of which is an hymn in praise of the Virgin Mary, entitled ἑκατόντα παρεκάλησις τῆς Θεοτόκου; further, the Hypothesis Eusebii are annexed to the Psalms, and his Canones to the Gospels. It is true, that this has no immediate reference to the New Testament, but may have influence in determining the antiquity of the manuscript itself.\n\nIt has neither accents nor marks of aspiration; it is written with capital, or, as they are called, uncial letters, and has very few abbreviations. There are no intervals between the words; but the sense of a passage is sometimes terminated by a point, and sometimes by a vacant space. Here arises a suspicion that the copyist did not understand Greek, because these marks are sometimes found even in the middle of a word, for instance Levit. v. 4. ἐν ὁμοίῳ γινέται ἐν ὁμοίῳ, and Numb. xiii. 29. ἐν ὁμοίῳ.\n\nThis manuscript was presented to Charles I. in 1628, by Cyril Lucaris patriarch of Constantinople. Cyril himself has given the following account: \"We know so much of this manuscript of the holy writings of the Old and New Testament, that Thecla an Egyptian lady of distinction (nobilis femina Ægyptia) wrote it with her own hand 1300 years ago (A). She lived soon after the council of Nice. Her name was formerly at the end of the book; but when Christianity was subverted in Egypt by the errors of Mahomet, the books of the Christians suffered the same fate, and the name of Thecla\n\n(a) He wrote this in the year 1628. According to this account, then, the manuscript must have been written in 328; a date to which so many weighty objections may be made, that its most strenuous advocates will hardly undertake to defend it. But this error has furnished Oudin with an opportunity of producing many arguments against the antiquity of the Codex Alexandrinus, which seem to imply, that Grabe and others, who have referred it to the fourth century, suppose it to have been written in the above-mentioned year. Now it is probable, that the inference which has been deduced from the account of Cyril is more than he himself intended to express, as he relates that Thecla lived after the council of Nice.\nThecla was expunged. But oral tradition of no very ancient date (memoria et traditio recent) has preserved the remembrance of it.\n\nBut the reader will see that this account is merely traditional. Dr Semler very properly observes, that there is no more reason to rely on a tradition reflecting the transcriber of an ancient manuscript, than on a tradition which relates to an ancient relic. The arguments which have been urged by Wetstein, Semler, Oudin, and Woide, to fix the date of this manuscript, are so many, that it would be tedious to repeat them. But, after all, its antiquity cannot be determined with certainty, though it appears from the formation of the letters, which resemble those of the fourth and fifth centuries, and the want of accents, that it was not written so late as the tenth century. In this century it was placed by Oudin, while Grabe and Schulze have referred it to the fourth, which is the very utmost period that can be allowed, because it contains the epistles of Athanasius. Wetstein, with more probability, has chosen a mean between these two extremes, and referred it to the fifth century; but we are not justified in drawing this inference from the formation of the letters alone, for it is well known that the same mode of forming the letters was retained longer in some countries and in some monasteries than in others.\n\nWe are now in possession of a perfect impression of this manuscript, which is accompanied with so complete and so critical a collection of various readings, as is hardly to be expected from the edition of any other manuscript. Dr Woide published it in 1786, with types cast for that purpose, line for line, without intervals between the words, as in the manuscript itself; the copy is so perfect a resemblance of the original, that it may supply its place. Its title is Novum Testamentum Graecum e codice MS. Alexandrino qui Londini in Bibliotheca Mylesi Britannici afferatur descriptionem. It is a very splendid folio; and the preface of the learned editor contains an accurate description of the manuscript, with an exact list of all its various readings, that takes up no less than 89 pages; and each reading is accompanied with a remark, in which is given an account of what his predecessors Junius, Walton, Fell, Mill, Grabe, and Wetstein, had performed or neglected.\n\nThe Vatican manuscript contained originally the whole Greek Bible, including both the Old and New Testament; and in this respect, as well as in regard to its antiquity, it resembles none so much as the Codex Alexandrinus, but no two manuscripts are more similar in their readings, in the New Testament as well as in the Old. After the Gospels, which are placed in the usual order, come the Acts of the Apostles, which are immediately followed by the seven catholic epistles. This must be particularly noted, because some have contended that the second Epistle of St Peter, with the second and third of St John, were wanting. Professor Hwiid, in a letter dated Rome, April 12, 1781, assured Michaelis that he had seen them with his own eyes, that the second Epistle of St Peter is placed folio 1434, the second of St John fol. 1442, the third fol. 1443:\n\n(b) Probably because the Epistle to the Hebrews, as well as the Epistle to the Galatians, relates to the abolition of the Mosaic law.\nScripture authorities, have been hitherto produced: But this manuscript has not throughout the whole New Testament the same uniform text.\n\nAs we have now a beautiful printed edition of the Alexandrian manuscript by Dr. Woide, it is much to be wished that we had also an exact impression of the Vatican manuscript. From the superstitious fears and intolerant spirit of the inquisition at Rome, all access to this manuscript was refused to the Abbé Spoletti, who presented a memorial for that purpose. Unless the pope interpose his authority, we must therefore despair of having our wishes gratified; but from the liberality of sentiment which the head of the Catholic church has shown on several occasions, we hope that the period is not far distant when the Vatican library will be open to the learned, and when the pope will think it his greatest honour to encourage their researches.\n\nThe most valuable editions of the Greek New Testament are those of Mill, Bengel, and Wetstein.\n\nThe edition of Mill, which was only finished 14 days before his death, occupied the attention of the author for 30 years.\n\nThe collections of various readings which had been made before the time of Mill, the Velesian, the Barberrini, those of Stephens, the London Polyglot, and Fell's edition, with those which the Bishop had left in manuscript, and whatever he was able to procure elsewhere, he brought together into one large collection. He made likewise very considerable additions to it. He collated several original editions more accurately than had been done before: he procured extracts from Greek manuscripts which had never been collated; and of such as had been before collated, but not with sufficient attention, he obtained more complete extracts. It is said that he has collected from manuscripts, fathers, and versions, not fewer than 30,000 various readings. This collection, notwithstanding its many imperfections, and the superiority of that of Wetstein, is still absolutely necessary to every critic: for Wetstein has omitted a great number of readings which are to be found in Mill, especially those which are either taken from the Vulgate, or confirm its readings. Mill was indeed too much attached to this version; yet he cannot be accused of partiality in producing its evidence, because it is the duty of a critic to examine the witnesses on both sides of the question: and Wetstein, by too frequently neglecting the evidence in favour of the Vulgate, has rendered his collection less perfect than it would otherwise have been. He likewise added, as far as he was able, readings from the ancient versions; and is much to be commended for the great attention which he paid to the quotations of the fathers; the importance of which he had sagacity enough to discern.\n\nIt cannot, however, be denied, that Mill's Greek Testament has many imperfections, and some of real importance. His extracts from manuscripts often are not only incomplete, but erroneous; and it is frequently necessary to correct his mistakes from the edition of Wetstein. His extracts from the oriental versions are also imperfect, because he was unacquainted with these languages; and in selecting readings from the Syriac, the Arabic, and Ethiopic, he was obliged to have recourse to the Latin translations, which are annexed to those versions in the London Polyglot.\n\nThe great diligence which Mill had shown in collecting so many various readings, alarmed the clergy as if the Christian religion had been in danger of subversion. It gave occasion for a time to the triumphs of the devil, and exposed the author to many attacks. But it is now universally known, that not a single article of the Christian religion would be altered though a devil were allowed to select out of Mill's 30,000 readings whatever he should think most inimical to the Christian cause.\n\nIn 1734, Bengel abbot of Alpirsbach, in the duchy of Wurtemburg, published a new edition of the Greek Testament. The fears which Mill had excited began to subside on this new publication; for Bengel was universally esteemed a man of piety. Bengel was not only diligent in the examination of various readings, but in the strictest sense of the word conscientious; for he considered it as an offence against the Deity, if, through his own fault, that is, through levity or carelessness, he introduced a false reading into the sacred text. His object was not merely to make a collection of readings, and leave the choice of them to the judgment of the reader, but to examine the evidence on both sides, and draw the inference; yet he has not given his own opinion so frequently as Mill, whom he resembled in his reverence for the Latin version, and in the preference which he gave to harsh and difficult readings, before those which were smooth and flowing. It may be observed in general, that he was a man of profound learning, and had a cool and sound judgment, though it did not prevent him from thinking too highly of the Latin readings, and of the Codex Alexandrinus, with other Latinizing manuscripts.\n\nThe imperfections of Bengel's edition arise chiefly from his diffidence and caution. He did not venture to insert into the text any reading which had not already appeared in some printed edition, even though he believed it to be the genuine reading. In the book of Revelation indeed he took the liberty to insert readings which had never been printed; because few manuscripts had been used in the printing of that book.\n\nThe celebrated edition of John James Wetstein, and of Wetstein which is the most important of all, and the most necessary to those engaged in sacred criticism, was published at Amsterdam in 1751 and 1752, in two volumes folio. No man will deny that Wetstein's Prolegomena discover profound erudition, critical penetration, and an intimate acquaintance with the Greek manuscripts. It is a work which in many respects has given a new turn to sacred criticism, and no man engaged in that study can dispense with it. Wherever Wetstein has delivered his sentiments respecting a Greek manuscript, which he has done less frequently than Mill, and indeed less frequently than we could have wished, he shows himself an experienced and sagacious critic. He is likewise more concise than Mill in delivering his opinion, and does not support it by producing so great a number of readings from the manuscript in question. This conciseness is the consequence of that warmth and haste which were peculiar to Wetstein's character, and which have sometimes given birth to mistakes. The fire of his disposition was likewise the cause of his advancing conjectures, in regard to the history of his manuscripts, which exceed the bounds of probability. But the critical\nScripture. tical rules which he has delivered are perfectly just; and in this respect there is a remarkable agreement between him and his eminent predecessors Mill and Bengel. In regard to the Latin version alone they appear to differ: in Mill and Bengel it has powerful, and perhaps partial, advocates; but in Wetstein a severe and cautious judge, who sometimes condemns it without a cause. The Greek manuscripts which confirm the readings of the Vulgate, and which he supposed had been corrupted from it, he of course condemned with equal severity: and some collections of various readings which had been made by Catholics, he made no scruple to pronounce a forgery, saying, \"Tineo Danaos et dona ferentes.\" But in consequence of his antipathy to the Vulgate, his collection of various readings is less perfect than it might have been.\n\nIt has been asked, 1. Whether he has quoted his manuscripts either falsely or imperfectly, in order to establish his own religious opinions? or, 2. Whether his diligence and accuracy have been such that we may at all times depend upon them? To the first of these questions there can be no other answer, than that Wetstein, in his character of a critic, is perfectly honest. With respect to the second, his diligence and accuracy, Michaelis thinks there is less reason to pronounce him faultless. But Mr Marsh has examined the examples on which Michaelis founded his assertion, and declares that Michaelis is mistaken in every one of them.\n\nThe diligence of Wetstein can scarcely be questioned by any who are acquainted with his history. He travelled into different countries, and examined with his own eyes a much greater number of manuscripts than any of his predecessors. His collection of various readings amounts to above a million; and he has not only produced a much greater quantity of matter than his predecessors, but has likewise corrected their mistakes. The extracts from manuscripts, versions, and printed editions of the Greek Testament, which had been quoted by Mill, are generally quoted by Wetstein. Whenever Wetstein had no new extracts from the manuscripts quoted by Mill, or had no opportunity of examining them himself, he copied literally from Mill; but wherever Mill has quoted from printed editions, as from the margin of Robert Stephen's for instance, or from the London Polyglot, Wetstein did not copy from Mill, but went to the original source, as appears from his having corrected many mistakes in Mill's quotations.\n\nIn the opinion of Michaelis, there are many defects in the edition of Wetstein, which require to be supplied, and many errors to be corrected. Yet still it must be allowed to be a work of immense labour, and most valuable to those engaged in sacred criticism; and it is surprising, when we consider the difficulties and labour which Wetstein had to encounter, that his errors and imperfections are so few.\n\nThe proposal of Michaelis, however, of a new collation of manuscripts, in order to form a complete collection of various readings, is worthy the attention of the learned. In mentioning this proposal, Michaelis turns a willing eye towards Britain, the only country, he says, which possesses the will and the means to execute the task. Should a resolution, he adds, be formed in this island, so happily situated for promoting the purposes of general knowledge, to make the undertaking a public concern, to enter into a subscription, and to employ men of abilities in collating manuscripts both at home and abroad, they would be able to do more in ten years than could otherwise be done in a century. And could this nation direct its attention to any object more glorious or more useful than in ascertaining the text of the sacred Scriptures, and giving to posterity an accurate edition?\n\nAs the sense of Scripture, as well as all other books, punctuation is affected by the punctuation, it is of importance to determine whether the stops or points which we find in New Testament books were used by the sacred writers, or have been inserted by modern transcribers.\n\nWe are told by Montfaucon, in his Palaeographia Graeca, p. 31, that the person who first distinguished the several parts of a period in Greek writing, by the introduction of a point, was Arithophanes of Byzantium, who lived under Ptolemaeus Epiphanes, in the 45th Olympiad. But though points were not used in books before this period, they were employed in inscriptions above 400 years before the birth of Christ. See Mont. Pal. Grce. p. 135.\n\nUnder the article Punctuation we mentioned, on authority which we reckoned unquestionable, that the ancient manuscripts were written without any points. We have now, however, discovered, from Woidt's edition of the Codex Alexandrinus, that points are used in that manuscript, though omitted in the facsimile given by Montfaucon. That they are found too in the Codex Vaticanus, though not frequently, is related by Birch in his Prologomena, p. 14.\n\nAs the fact has not been generally known, that the ancients pointed their manuscripts, and as it is an important and interesting fact, we shall present our readers with the first five lines of St John's Gospel, as they are pointed in the Alexandrian manuscript:\n\nΕΝΑΡΧΗΝΟΛΟΓΟΣΚΑΙΟΛΟΓΟΣΗΝ ΠΡΟΣΤΟΝΟΝ ΚΑΙΘΕΝΟΛΟΓΟΣ· ΟΥΤΟΣΗΝΕΝΑΡΧΗΠΡΟΣΤΟΝΩΝ ΗΝΤΑΔΙΑΥΤΟΥΕΝΕΝΤΟΚΑΙΧΩ ΡΕΙΣΑΤΟΥΕΝΕΝΤΟΥΛΑΕΝ· ΟΤΕΓΡΟΝΕΝΕΝΑΤΤΩΩΛΗΝ·\n\nWhether any points for marking the sense were used by the apostles, cannot be determined; but the points now in use have been invented since.\n\nIn the fourth century, Jerome began to add the comma and colon to the Latin version; and they were then inserted in many more ancient manuscripts. In the fifth century, Euthalius a deacon of Alexandria divided the New Testament into lines. This division was regulated by the sense, so that each line ended where some pause was to be made in speaking. And when a copyist was disposed to contract his space, and therefore crowded the lines into each other, he then placed a point where Euthalius had terminated the line. In the eighth century, the stroke was invented which we call a comma. In the Latin manuscripts, Jerome's points were introduced by Paul Warnfried and Alcuin, at the command of Charlemagne. In the ninth century, the Greek note of interrogation (i) was first used. At the invention of printing the editors placed the\nScripture points arbitrarily, probably without bestowing the necessary attention; and Stephens, in particular, varied his points in every edition (D).\n\nThe meaning of many passages in the Scripture has been altered by false pointing. We shall produce one instance of this: Mat. v. 34, is commonly pointed in this manner, εγὼ δὲ λέγω σοι, μὴ ὑποκρίνηται ὁμός παρὰ τῷ οὐρανῷ, and consequently translated, \"But I say unto you, swear not at all.\" But if, instead of the colon placed after ὁμός, we substitute a comma, the translation will be, \"But I say to you that you ought by no means to swear, either by heaven, for it is his throne, or by earth, for it is his footstool.\" The command of Christ therefore applies particularly to the abuse of oaths among the Pharisees, who on every trivial occasion swore by the heaven, the earth, the temple, the head, &c., but it implies no prohibition to take an oath in the name of the Deity on solemn and important occasions.\n\nThe ancients divided the New Testament into two kinds of chapters, some longer and some shorter. This method appears to be more ancient than St Jerome, for he expunged a passage from the New Testament which makes an entire chapter. The longer kind of chapters were called breves, the shorter capitula. St Matthew contained, according to Jerome, 68 breves; Mark contained 48; Luke 83; and John 18. All the evangelists together consisted of 217 breves and 1126 capitula. The inventor of our modern division into chapters was Hugo de S. Caro, a French Dominican friar, who lived in the 13th century.\n\nThe ancients had two kinds of verses, one of which they called στίχοι, and the other στίχους. The remata were lines which contained a certain number of letters, like our printed books, and therefore often broke off in the middle of a word. Josephus's 20 books of Antiquities contained 60,000 of them, though in Ittigius's edition there are only 49,000 broken lines.\n\nStichi were lines measured by the sentence: according to an ancient written list mentioned by Father Simin, there were in the New Testament 18,612 of these.\n\nThe verses into which the New Testament is now divided are more modern, and an imitation of the division of the Old Testament. Robert Stephens, the first inventor, introduced them in his edition in the year 1551. He made this division on a journey from Lyons to Paris; and, as his son Henry tells us in the preface to the Concordance of the New Testament, he made it inter equitandum. This phrase probably means, that when he was weary of riding, he amused himself with this work at his inn.\n\nThis invention of the learned printer was soon introduced into all the editions of the New Testament; and vantages, it must be confessed, that in consulting and quoting the Scriptures, and in framing concordances for them, a subdivision into minute parts is of the greatest utility. But all the purposes of utility could surely have been gained, without adopting the hasty and indigested division of Stephens, which often breaks the sentence in pieces, renders plain passages obscure, and difficult passages unintelligible. To the injudicious division of Stephens we may ascribe a great part of the difficulties which attend the interpretation of the New Testament, and a great many of those absurd opinions which have disgraced the ages of the Reformation. For as separate verses appear to the eyes of the learned, and to the minds of the unlearned, as so many detached sentences, they have been supposed to contain complete sense, and they have accordingly been explained without any regard to the context, and often in direct opposition to it. Were any modern history or continued discourse divided into fragments with as little regard to the sense, we should soon find, that as many opposite meanings could be forced upon them as have been forced upon the books of the New Testament. The division into verses has been still more injurious to the Epistles than to the Gospels, for there is a close connection between the different parts of the Epistles, which the verses entirely dissolve. It is therefore to be wished that this division into verses were laid aside. The Scriptures ought to be divided into paragraphs, according to the sense; and the figures ought to be thrown into the margin. In this way, the figures will retain their utility without their disadvantages. Dr Campbell, in his beautiful translation of the Gospels, has adopted this method with great judgment and success; and he who will read that translation, will perceive that this fickle alteration renders the Gospels much more intelligible, and, we may add, more entertaining (E).\n\nThe word ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ signifies any joyful tidings, Meaning of and the word Gospel.\n\n(d) The reader will perceive that the account of the origin of points is different from that given under Punctuation. But the best authors differ upon this subject. We shall perhaps reconcile the difference, by supposing that points were invented at the time here mentioned, but were not in general use till the time mentioned under the article Punctuation.\n\n(E) We shall here subjoin, as a curiosity, what the anonymous author terms the Old and New Testament dissected. It contains an enumeration of all the books, chapters, verses, words, and letters, which occur in the English Bible and Apocrypha. It is said to have occupied three years of the author's life, and is a singular instance of the trifling employments to which superstition has led mankind.\n\nThe Old and New Testament dissected.\n\n| Books in the Old | 39 | in the New | 27 | Total | 66 |\n|------------------|----|------------|----|-------|----|\n| Chapters         | 929|            |    |       | 1189|\n| Verbs            | 23,214|          |    |       | 31,173|\n| Words            | 592,439|         |    |       | 773,692|\n| Letters          | 2,728,100|        |    |       | 3,566,480|\n\nApocryph. Chapters 183 Verbs 6081 Words 152,185\nScripture, and exactly corresponds to our English word GOSPEL.\n\nIn the New Testament this term is confined to \"The glad tidings of the coming of the Messiah.\" Thus, in Mat. xi. 5, our Lord says, \"The poor have the Gospel preached;\" that is, The Coming of the Messiah is preached to the poor. Hence the name of Gospel was given to the histories of Christ, in which the good news of the coming of the Messiah, with all its joyful circumstances, are recorded.\n\nThat the Gospel according to Matthew was composed, says Dr Campbell, by one born a Jew, familiarly acquainted with the opinions, ceremonies, and customs of his countrymen; that it was composed by one conversant in the sacred writings, and habituated to their idiom; a man of plain sense, but of little or no learning, except what he derived from the Scriptures of the Old Testament; and finally, that it was the production of a man who wrote from conviction, and had attended closely to the facts and speeches which he related, but who in writing entertained not the most distant view of setting off himself—we have as strong internal evidence as the nature of the thing will admit, and much stronger than that wherein the mind ninety-nine cases out of a hundred acquiesces.\n\nThat the author of this history of our blest Saviour was Matthew, appears from the testimony of the early Christians. It is attested by Jerome, Augustin, Epiphanius, and Chrysostom, and in such a manner as shews that they knew the fact to be uncontroverted, and judged it to be incontrovertible. Origen, who flourished in the former part of the 3d century, is also respectable authority. He is quoted by Eusebius in a chapter * wherein he specially treats of Origen's account of the sacred canon. \"As I have learned (says Origen) by tradition concerning the four gospels, which alone are received without dispute by the whole church of God under heaven; the first was written by Matthew, once a publican, afterwards an apostle of Jesus Christ, who delivered it to the Jewish believers, composed in the Hebrew language.\" In another place he says, \"Matthew writing for the Hebrews who expected him who was to descend from Abraham and David, says\n\nthe lineage of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.\" It must be observed, that the Greek word ἀπόδοσις does not exactly correspond to the English word tradition, which signifies any thing delivered orally from age to age. ἀπόδοσις properly implies anything transmitted from former ages, whether by oral or written testimony. In this acceptation we find it used in Scripture+; \"Hold the traditions (τὰς ἀπόδοσις) which I Theil ii., ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.\" 15\n\nThe next authority to which we shall have recourse is that of Irenæus bishop of Lyons, who had been a disciple of Polycarp. He says in the only book of his extant, that \"Matthew, among the Hebrews, wrote a Euéb. Hjfl. gospel in their own language, whilst Peter and Paul Ecc. lib. vi. were preaching the gospel at Rome and founding the church there.\"\n\nTo the testimony of these writers it may be objected, that, except Irenæus, they all lived in the third and fourth centuries, and consequently their evidence is of little importance. But there is such unanimity in the testimony, that it must have been derived from some authentic source. And is it fair to question the veracity of respectable men merely because we knew not from what writings they received their information? Many books which were then extant are now lost; and how do we know but these might have contained sufficient evidence? Irenæus at least had the best opportunities of information, having been well acquainted in his youth with Polycarp, the disciple of John; no objection can therefore be made to his evidence. But we can quote an authority still nearer the times of the apostles. Papias bishop of Hierapolis, in Cæsarea, who flourished about A.D. 116, affirms that Matthew wrote his gospel in the Hebrew tongue, which every one interpreted as he was able §. Papias was the companion of Polycarp, and besides must have been acquainted with many persons who lived in the time of the apostles. The fact therefore is fully established, that Matthew, the apostle of our Saviour, was the author of that gospel which is placed first in our editions of the New Testament.\n\nThe next subject of inquiry respects the language in which\n\n---\n\nThe middle Chapter and the least in the Bible is Psalm 117.\nThe middle Verse is the 8th of the 118th Psalm.\nThe middle time is the 2d of Chronicles, 4th Chap. 16th Verse.\nThe word And occurs in the Old Testament 35,543 times.\nThe same in the New Testament occurs 10,684 times.\nThe word Jehovah occurs 6855 times.\n\nOLD TESTAMENT.\nThe middle Book is Proverbs.\nThe middle Chapter is Job 29th.\nThe middle Verse is 2d Chron. 20th Chap. between 17th and 18th Verses.\nThe least Verse is 1 Chron. 1st Chap. and 1st Verse.\n\nNEW TESTAMENT.\nThe middle Book is Thessalonians 2d.\nThe middle Chapter is between the 13th and 14th Romans.\nThe middle Verse is 17th Chap. Acts, 17th Verse.\nThe least Verse is 11th Chap. John, Verse 35.\nThe 21st Verse of the 7th Chapter of Ezra has all the letters of the alphabet.\nThe 19th Chapter of 2d Kings and 37th of Isaiah are alike.\nwhich it was written. This we are assured by Papias, by Irenaeus, and Origen, was the Hebrew; but the truth of this fact has been disputed by Eusebius, Whitby, and others. Whitby urges the improbability that Providence would have suffered the original of this gospel to be lost, and nothing to remain but a translation. This is an argument of no force against written testimony; indeed we are always in danger of drawing false conclusions when we argue from our own opinions of the conduct of Providence: For His ways are not as our ways, nor His thoughts as our thoughts. But though we are forced to acknowledge that the gospel according to Matthew which we possess is a translation, it is evidently a close one; and the very circumstance that it has superseded the original, is a clear proof that it was thought equally valuable by the ancient Christians. It is necessary to remark, that the language in which the gospel according to Matthew was originally composed, and which is called Hebrew by Papias, Irenaeus, and Origen, is not the same with the Hebrew of the Old Testament: it was what Jerome very properly terms Syro-Chaldaic, having an affinity to both languages, but much more to the Chaldean than to the Syrian.\n\nThe time when this gospel was composed has not been precisely ascertained by the learned. Irenaeus says that \"Matthew published his gospel when Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome.\" Now Paul arrived at Rome A.D. 60 or 61, and it is very probable suffered martyrdom in A.D. 65. This may be justly concluded from comparing the relation of Tacitus with that of Orosius, a writer of the fifth century. Orosius having given an account of Nero's persecution of the Christians, and of the death of the two apostles in it, adds, that it was followed by a pestilence in the city, and other disasters. And Tacitus relates that a pestilence prevailed in the city, and violent storms took place in Italy, in the year of Christ 65. Matthew's gospel was therefore written between the year 60 and 65.\n\nThat this history was primarily intended for the use of the Jews, we have, besides historical evidence, very strong presumptions from the book itself. Every circumstance is carefully pointed out which might conciliate the faith of that nation; every unnecessary expression is avoided, which might in any way serve to obstruct it. To come to particulars, there was no sentiment relating to the Messiah with which the Jews were more strongly possessed, than that he must be of the race of Abraham, and of the family of David. Matthew, therefore, with great propriety, begins his narrative with the genealogy of Jesus. That he should be born at Bethlehem in Judea, is another circumstance in which the learned among the Jews were universally agreed. His birth in that city, with some very memorable circumstances that attended it, this historian has also taken the first opportunity to mention. Those passages in the prophets, or other sacred books, which either foretell anything that should happen to him, or admit an allusive appellation, or were in that age generally understood to be applicable to events which respect the Messiah, are never passed over in silence by this Evangelist. The fulfillment of prophecy was always to the Jews, who were convinced of the inspiration of their sacred writings, strong evidence. Accordingly none of the Evangelists has been more careful than Matthew, that nothing of this kind should be overlooked.\n\nThat which chiefly distinguishes Matthew's writings from those of the other Evangelists, is the minute and distinct manner in which he has related many of our Lord's discourses and moral instructions. Of these his sermon on the mount, his charge to the apostles, his illustrations of the nature of his kingdom, and his prophecy on Mount Olivet, are examples. He has also wonderfully united simplicity and energy in relating the replies of his master to the cavils of his adversaries. Being early called to the apostleship, he was an eye and ear witness of most of the things which he relates. And there are circumstances which incline Dr Campbell to think that Matthew has approached as near the precise order of time in which the events happened as any of the Evangelists.\n\nConcerning the life of the apostle Matthew we have nothing to add, as the principal circumstances in his life have already been mentioned. See MATTHEW.\n\nThe Gospel according to Matthew is cited seven times in the epistle of Barnabas, twice in the first epistle of Clemens Romanus to the Corinthians, eight times in the Shepherd of Hermas, six times in Polycarp's small epistle to the Philippians, and seven times in the smaller epistles of Ignatius. These citations may be seen at full length in Jowett's New and Full Method of settling the Canon, with the parallel passages in the gospel according to Matthew.\n\nThat Mark was the author of the gospel which bears his name, and that it was the second in the order of writing, is proved by the unanimous testimony of the ancient Christians. Many authorities are therefore unnecessary; we shall only mention those of Papias and Irenaeus. Eusebius has preserved the following passage of Papias: \"This is what was related by the elder (that is, John, not the apostle, but a disciple of Jesus); Mark iii. iii. cap. being Peter's interpreter wrote exactly whatever he remembered, not indeed in the order wherein things were spoken and done by the Lord; for he was not himself a hearer or follower of our Lord; but he afterwards, as I said, followed Peter who gave instructions as suited the occasions, but not as a regular history of our Lord's teaching. Mark, however, committed no mistake in writing such things as occurred to his memory: for of this one thing he was careful, to omit nothing which he had heard, and to insert no falsehood into his narrative.\" Such is the testimony of Papias, which is the more to be regarded as he affirms his authority. He spoke not from hearsay, but from the information which he had received from a most credible witness, John the elder, or presbyter, a disciple of Jesus, and a companion of the apostles.\n\nIrenaeus, after telling us that Matthew published his gospel whilst Peter and Paul were preaching at Rome, adds: \"After their departure (ἐξόδου), Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, delivered to us in writing the things which had been preached by Peter.\" The Greek ἐξόδου, like the English word departure, may either denote death, which is a departure out of the world, or mean a departure out of the city. It is probably in the former of these senses it is here used. Yet by the accounts given by some others, Mark's gospel was published in Peter's lifetime, and had his approbation.\nScripture approbation. The gospel of Mark is supposed to be but two years posterior in date to that of Matthew. The precise year, however, cannot be determined with certainty; and it is a matter of no importance, since we have ascertained the author and the time in which he lived.\n\nMark has generally been supposed to be the same person who is mentioned in the Acts and some of Paul's epistles, who is called John, and was the nephew of Barnabas. But as this person was the attendant of Paul and Barnabas, and is nowhere in scripture said to have accompanied Peter in his apostolical mission, which ancient writers inform us the author of the gospel did, Dr Campbell has justly concluded that these were different persons. The author of the gospel is certainly meant by Peter when he says Marcus my son saluteth you.\n\nThat Mark wrote his gospel in Greek, is as evidently conformable to the testimony of antiquity, as that Matthew wrote his in Hebrew or Syro-Chaldaic. The cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine, anxious to exalt the language in which the vulgate was written, have maintained that this Evangelist published his work in Latin. The only appearance of testimony which has been produced in support of this opinion is the inscription subjoined to this gospel in Syriac, and in some other oriental versions. But these policripts are not the testimonies of the translators; they proceed from the conjecture of some transcriber; but when written, or by whom, is equally unknown. Against positive testimony therefore they are entitled to no credit.\n\nFrom the Hebraisms in the style, we should readily conclude that the author was by birth and education a Jew. There are also expressions which show that he had lived for some time among the Latins, as ἐκείνων, \"centurion,\" and στρατιώτης, \"sentinel;\" words which do not occur in the other gospels. There are other internal evidences that this gospel was written beyond the confines of Judea. The first time the Jordan is mentioned, ποταμός, \"river,\" is added to the name for explanation; for though no person in Judea needed to be informed that Jordan was a river, the case was different in distant countries. The word Gehenna, which is translated Hell in the New Testament, originally signified the Valley of Hinnom, where infants had been sacrificed by fire to Moloch, and where a continual fire was afterwards kept up to consume the filth of Jerusalem. As this word could not have been understood by a foreigner, the Evangelist adds, by way of explanation, ἀνά το ἀεί, \"the unquenchable fire.\" Instead of the word Mammon, he uses the common term ἰσχυρά, \"riches.\" When he employs the oriental word Corbon, he subjoins the interpretation ἢ ἐστὶ δῶρον, \"that is, a gift.\" These peculiarities will corroborate the historical evidence that has been already mentioned, that Mark intended his gospel for the use of the Gentiles.\n\nIt has been affirmed that this evangelist is the abridger of Matthew. It is true that Mark sometimes copies the expressions used by Matthew; but he is not to be considered as a mere abridger, for he omits altogether several things related by Matthew, viz. our Lord's pedigree, his birth, the visit of the Magians, Joseph's flight into Egypt, and the cruelty of Herod. Dr Lardner has given a list of thirty-three passages, where-\n\nin circumstances are related which are omitted by the other evangelists. There is one parable, and an account of two miracles peculiar to Mark. The parable or similitude is mentioned in chap. iv. 26. One of these miracles was the curing of a deaf and dumb man, chap. vii. 31, 37. The other was the giving sight to a blind man at Bethsaida, chap. viii. 22, 26. The style of Mark, instead of being more concise than that of Matthew, is more diffuse. That he had read Matthew's gospel cannot be doubted, but that he abridged it, is a mistake.\n\nAccording to the testimony which has been already produced, Mark derived his information from the apostle Peter. It would be improper, therefore, not to remark, from that this evangelist has omitted many things tending to Peter's honour, which are related in the other gospels, and has given the most particular account of Peter's fall. This gospel is seven times cited by Irenaeus, and nine times by Tertullian.\n\nThat the author of the gospel which is the third in order was Luke, the companion of the apostle Paul, is evident from the testimonies of Irenaeus, Clemens of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and many succeeding writers. But it has been disputed whether he was a Jew or a Gentile. That Luke was a Jew by birth, or at least by religion, may be argued from his being a constant companion of Paul. If he had been an uncircumcised Gentile, exceptions would have been made to him, especially at Jerusalem; but nothing of that kind appears. It is also rendered highly probable, from his mode of computing time by the Jewish festivals, and from his frequent use of the Hebrew idiom. It has been supposed that Luke was one of the seventy disciples; but he does not pretend to have been a witness of our Lord's miracles and teaching; on the contrary, he tells us in his introduction, that he received his information from others.\n\nThe design of Luke in writing his gospel was to supply some imperfect and inaccurate histories of our Saviour, which had then been published. What these were, it is impossible now to determine, as they are not mentioned by any contemporary writer, and probably did not survive the age in which they were composed.\n\nIt has been supposed that Luke chiefly derived his information from the apostle Paul, whom he faithfully attended in his travels; but, from Luke's own words, we are led to conclude, that the principal source of his intelligence, as to the facts related in the gospel, was from those who had been eye and ear witnesses of what our Lord both did and taught. Now Paul evidently was not of this number. It was from conversing with some of the twelve apostles or disciples of our Lord, who heard his discourses and saw his miracles, that he obtained his information.\n\nAs to the time when this gospel was written, we have hardly anything but conjecture to guide us. But as Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, have ranged it after those of Matthew and Mark, we have no reason to doubt but they were written in the same order.\n\nThe gospel by Luke has supplied us with many interesting particulars which had been omitted both by Matthew and Mark. It has given a distinct narration of the circumstances attending the birth of John the Baptist and the nativity of our Saviour. It has given an\nScripture, an account of several memorable incidents and cures which had been overlooked by the rest; the conversion of Zaccheus the publican; the cure of the woman who had been bowed down for 18 years; the cure of the drooping man; the cleansing of the ten lepers; the inhospitable treatment of our Saviour by the Samaritans, and the instructive rebuke which he gave on that occasion to two of his disciples for their intemperate zeal; also the affecting interview which he had after his resurrection with two of his disciples. Luke has also added many edifying parables to those which the other evangelists had recorded. Most of these are specified by Irenaeus as particularly belonging to this gospel, and has thereby shown to us, without intending it, that the gospel of Luke was the same in his time that it is at present.\n\nThe style of this evangelist abounds as much with Hebraisms as any of the sacred writings, but it contains more of the Grecian idiom than any of them. It is also distinguished by greater variety and copiousness; qualities which may be justly ascribed to the superior learning of the author. His occupation as a physician would naturally induce him to employ some time in reading, and give him easier access to the company of the great than any of the other evangelists. As an instance of Luke's copiousness, Dr Campbell has remarked that each of the evangelists has a number of words which are used by none of the rest; but in Luke's gospel the number of such peculiarities or words, used in none of the other gospels, is greater than that of the peculiar words found in all the three other gospels put together; and that the terms peculiar to Luke are for the most part long and compound words. The same judicious writer has also observed, that there is more of composition in Luke's sentences than is found in the other three, and consequently less simplicity. Of this the very first sentence is an example, which occupies no less than four verses. Luke, too, has a greater resemblance to other historians, in giving what may be called his own verdict in the narrative part of this work; a freedom which the other evangelists have seldom or never ventured to use. He calls the Pharisees lovers of money; in distinguishing Judas Iscariot from the other Judas, he uses the phrase, \"he who proved a traitor,\" (καὶ ἐποίησεν προδότης). Matthew and Mark express the same sentiment in milder language, \"he who delivered him up.\" In recording the moral instructions of our Lord, especially his parables, this evangelist has united an affecting sweetness of manner with genuine simplicity.\n\nThis gospel is frequently cited by Clemens Romanus, the contemporary of the Apostles, by Ignatius, and Justin Martyr. Irenaeus has made above a hundred citations from it. In his lib. iii. adv. Haeret. c. 14, he vindicates the authority and perfection of Luke's gospel, and has produced a collection of those facts which are only recorded by this evangelist.\n\nThat the gospel which is placed last in our editions of the New Testament was written by John, one of our Saviour's apostles, is confirmed by the unanimous testimony of the ancient Christians. He was the son of Zebedee, a fisherman of Bethsaida in Galilee, by his wife Salome, and the brother of James, named the elder or greater. He was the beloved disciple of our Saviour, and was honoured, along with Peter and James, with many marks of distinction which were not conferred on the other disciples. He possessed a high degree of intrepidity and zeal, a warm and affectionate heart, and was strongly attached to his master. His brother James and he were honoured with the title of Boanerges, or Sons of Thunder. He was anxious to restrain whatever he considered as a mark of disrespect against his master, and to punish his enemies with severity. He was incensed against some persons for attempting to cast out demons in the name of Jesus; and required them to desist because they were not his disciples. James and he proposed to our Saviour to call down fire from heaven to punish the inhospitable Samaritans. Nor was the courage of John less ardent than his zeal. When Peter had disowned his Lord, and all the other disciples had fled, John continued to attend his master. He was present at his trial, and followed him to the cross, where he was a spectator of his sufferings and death. The interview between Jesus and this disciple at Calvary, though concisely related, is an event which will strongly affect every man of feeling, while it convinces him of the unalterable affection of Jesus to his beloved disciple, as well as discovers his respectful tenderness for his mother. See John.\n\nThe ancients inform us, that there were two motives which induced John to write his gospel: the one, that he might refute the heresies of Cerinthus and the Nicolaitans, who had attempted to corrupt the Christian doctrine; the other motive was, that he might supply those important events in the life of our Saviour which the other evangelists had omitted. Of the former of these motives Irenaeus gives us the following account: \"John, desirous to extirpate the errors sown in the minds of men by Cerinthus, and some time before by those called Nicolaitans, published his gospel; wherein he acquaints us that there is one God, who made all things by his word, and not, as they say, one who is the Creator of the world, and another who is the father of the Lord; one the son of the Creator, and another the Christ, from the supercelestial abodes who descended upon Jesus, the son of the Creator, but remained impassible, and afterwards fled back into his own pleasure or fulness.\" As Irenaeus is the most ancient author who has written upon this subject, many appeals have been made to his authority. The authority of Not to confute here-\n\nIrenaeus is certainly respectable, and we have often referred to his testimony with confidence; but we think it necessary to make a distinction between receiving his testimony to a matter of fact, and implicitly adopting his opinion. He does not tell us, that he derived his information from any preceding writer, or indeed from any person at all. Nay, he seems to have believed that John wrote against these heresies by a prophetic spirit; for he says in another place, chap. xx. 30. \"As John the disciple of our Lord affirms us, saying, But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life through his name; FORESEEING these blasphemous notions that divide the Lord, so far as it is in their power.\"\n\nIndeed it seems very improbable that an apostle should write a history of our Lord on purpose to confute the wild opinions of Cerinthus or any other heretic. Had John considered such a confutation necessary, it is more likely that he would have introduced it into\nScripture into an epistle than blended it with the actions of his venerable Master. But were the opinion of Irenæus well-founded, we should surely discover some traces of it in the gospel of John; yet except in the introduction, there is nothing that can with the least shadow of probability be applied to the opinions of Cerinthus; and few, we presume, will affirm, that the gospel of John was composed merely for the sake of the first eighteen verses.\n\nThe intention of John in writing his gospel was far more extensive and important than to refute the opinions of a few men who were to sink into oblivion in the course of a few centuries. It was evidently (according to the opinion of Clemens of Alexandria) to supply the omissions of the other evangelists: it was to exhibit the evidences of the Christian religion in a distinct and perspicuous manner: it was, as he himself in the conclusion of his gospel affirms us, to convince his readers, that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that believing they might have life through his name*. Now it will appear to any person who reads this gospel with attention, that he has executed his plan with astonishing ability, and has given the most circumstantial and satisfactory evidence that Jesus was the Messiah the Son of God. After declaring the pre-existence of Jesus, he proceeds to deliver the testimony of John the Baptist, and selects some of the greatest miracles of Jesus to prove his divine mission. In the fifth chapter he prefends us with a discourse which our Saviour delivered in the temple in the presence of the Jews, wherein he states in a very distinct manner the proofs of his mission from, 1. The testimony of John; 2. His own miracles; 3. The declaration of the Father at his baptism; 4. The Jewish Scriptures. Indeed the conclusion that Jesus was the Messiah the Son of God, naturally arises from almost every miracle which our Saviour is said to have performed, and from every discourse that he delivered. This declaration is very often made by our Saviour himself; particularly to the woman of Samaria, to Nicodemus, and to the blind man whom he had cured.\n\nIt must be evident to every reader, that John studiously passes over those passages in our Lord's history and teaching which had been treated at large by the other evangelists, or, if he mentions them at all, he mentions them slightly. This confirms the testimony of ancient writers, that the first three gospels were written and published before John composed his gospel. Except the relation of our Saviour's trial, death, and resurrection, almost everything which occurs in this book is new. The account of our Saviour's nativity, of his baptism, and of his temptation in the wilderness, is omitted; nor is any notice taken of the calling of the twelve apostles, or of their mission during our Saviour's life. It is remarkable, too, that not one parable is mentioned, nor any of the predictions relating to the destruction of Jerusalem. All the miracles recorded by the other evangelists are passed over, except the miraculous supply of provision, by which five thousand were fed: and it is probable that this miracle was related for the sake of the discourse to which it gave birth. The other miracles which are mentioned are few in number, but in general they are minutely detailed. They consist of these: the turning of water into wine at Cana; the cure of the diseased man at the pool of Bethesda; the cure of the man that had been blind from his birth; the raising of Lazarus to life; and the healing of the servant's ear which Peter had cut off. But valuable would this gospel be, though it had only recorded the consolation of Jesus to his disciples previous to his departure; which exhibits a most admirable view of our Saviour's character, of his care and tender regard for his disciples. Having opened every source of comfort to their desponding minds; exhorted them to mutual love, and to the obedience of his Father's precepts; having warned them of the impending dangers and sorrows—our Saviour concludes with a prayer, in the true spirit of piety and benevolence; ardent without enthusiasm, sober and rational without lukewarmness.\n\nThe time in which this gospel was written has not been fixed with any precision. Irenæus informs us, that it was written at Ephesus, but leaves us to conjecture whether it was written before or after John's return from Patmos. He was banished to Patmos by Domitian, who reigned 15 years, and according to the best computation died A.D. 96. The persecution which occasioned the exile of John commenced in the 14th year of Domitian's reign. If John wrote his gospel after his return to Ephesus, which is affirmed by Epiphanius to have been the case, we may fix the date of it about the year 97 (f).\n\nThis gospel is evidently the production of an illiterate style of literature, and its style is remarkable for simplicity. It abounds more with Hebraisms than any of the other gospels; and contains some strong oriental figures which are not readily understood by an European.\n\nThis gospel is cited once by Clemens Romanus, by Barnabas three times, by Ignatius five times, by Justin Martyr six times, by Irenæus, and above forty times by Clements Alexandrinus.\n\nThe book which we intitle the Acts of the Apostles Acts of the connects the gospels and the epistles. It is evidently a continuation of Luke's gospel, which appears both from the introduction and from the attestations of ancient Christians. Both are dedicated to Theophilus; and in the beginning of the Acts a reference is made to his gospel, which he calls a former treatise, recording the actions and discourses of Jesus till his ascension to heaven. Luke is mentioned as the author of the Acts of the Apostles by Irenæus, by Tertullian, by Origen, and Eusebius.\n\nFrom the frequent use of the first person plural, it is manifest that Luke the author was present at many of the\n\n(f) It has been argued from a passage in this gospel, that it must have been written before the destruction of Jerusalem. In speaking of the pool of Bethesda, John uses the present tense: His words are, \"There is at Jerusalem.\" Now if these words had been written after the destruction of Jerusalem, it is urged the past tense would have been used, and not the present. This argument is more specious than forcible. Though Jerusalem was demolished, does it follow that the pool of Bethesda was dried up?\nthe transactions which he relates. He appears to have accompanied Paul from Troas to Philippi. He attended him also to Jerusalem, and afterwards to Rome, where he remained for two years. He is mentioned by Paul in several of those epistles which were written from Rome, particularly in the 2d epistle to Timothy, and in the epistle to Philemon.\n\nThis book contains the history of the Christian church for the space of about 28 or 30 years, from the time of our Saviour's ascension to Paul's arrival at Rome in the year 60 or 61. As it informs us that Paul resided two years in Rome, it must have been written after the year 63; and as the death of Paul is not mentioned, it is probable it was composed before that event, which happened A.D. 65.\n\nThe Acts of the Apostles may be divided into seven parts. 1. The account of our Saviour's ascension, and of the occurrences which happened on the first Pentecost after that event, contained in chap. i. ii. 2. The transactions of the Christians of the circumcision at Jerusalem, in Judea, and Samaria, chap. iii.—ix. xi. i—xii. xiii. 3. Transactions in Caesarea, and the admission of the Gentiles, chap. x. 4. The first circuit of Barnabas and Paul among the Gentiles, chap. xi. 22. xiii. xiv. 5. Embassy to Jerusalem, and the first council held in that city, chap. xv. 6. Paul's second journey, chap. xvi.—xxi. 7. His arrestment, trial, appeal to Caesar, and journey to Rome, chap. xxii. to the end of the book.\n\nThe Acts of Apostles are cited by Clemens Romanus, by Polycarp, by Justin Martyr, thirty times by Irenaeus, and seven times by Clemens Alexandrinus.\n\nAll the essential doctrines and precepts of the Christian religion were certainly taught by our Saviour himself, and are contained in the gospels. The epistles may be considered as commentaries on the doctrines of the gospel, addressed to particular societies, accommodated to their respective situations; intended to refute the errors and false notions which prevailed among them, and to inculcate those virtues in which they were most deficient.\n\nThe plan on which these Letters are written is, first, to decide the controversy, or refute the erroneous notions which had arisen in the society to which the epistle was addressed; and, secondly, to recommend those duties which their false doctrines might induce them to neglect; at the same time inculcating in general exhortations the most important precepts of Christian morality.\n\nOf the epistles fourteen were written by St. Paul. These are not placed according to the order of time in which they were composed, but according to the supposed precedence of the societies or persons to whom they were addressed. It will be proper therefore to exhibit here their chronological order according to Dr. Lardner.\n\nA Table of St. Paul's Epistles, with the Places where, and times when, written, according to Dr. Lardner.\n\n| Epistles | Places | A.D. |\n|----------|--------|------|\n| 1 Thessalonians | Corinth | 52 |\n| 2 Thessalonians | Corinth | 52 |\n| Galatians | Corinth or Ephesus | near the end of 52 or beginning of 53 |\n\nIt is more difficult to understand the epistolary writings than the gospels; the cause of which is evident. Many things are omitted in a letter, or slightly mentioned, because supposed to be known by the person to whom it is addressed. To a stranger this will create much difficulty. The business about which St. Paul wrote was certainly well known to his correspondents; but at this distance of time we can obtain no information concerning the occasion of his writing, of the character and circumstances of those persons for whom his letters were intended, except what can be gleaned from the writings themselves. It is no wonder, therefore, though many allusions should be obscure. Besides, it is evident from many passages that he answers letters and questions which his correspondents had sent him. If these had been preferred, they would have thrown more light upon many things than all the notes and conjectures of the commentators.\n\nThe causes of obscurity which have been now mentioned are common to all the writers of the epistles; but there are some peculiar to St. Paul. 1. As he had an acute and fertile mind, he seems to have written with great rapidity, and without attending much to the common rules of method and arrangement. To this cause we may ascribe his numerous and long parentheses. In the heat of argument he sometimes breaks off abruptly to follow out some new thought; and when he has exhausted it, he returns from his digression without informing his readers; so that it requires great attention to retain the connection. 2. His frequent change of person, too, creates ambiguity: by the pronoun I he sometimes means himself; sometimes any Christian; sometimes a Jew, and sometimes any man. In using the pronoun we he sometimes intends himself; sometimes comprehends his companions; sometimes the apostles;\nScripture; at one time he alludes to the converted Jews, at another time to the converted Gentiles. 3. There is a third cause of obscurity; he frequently proposes objections, and answers them without giving any formal intimation. There are other difficulties which arise from our uncertainty who are the persons he is addressing, and what are the particular opinions and practices to which he refers. To these we may add two external causes, which have increased the difficulty of understanding the epistles. 1. The dividing them into chapters and verses, which dissolves the connection of the parts, and breaks them into fragments. If Cicero's epistles had been so disjointed, the reading of them would be attended with less pleasure and advantage, and with a great deal more labour. 2. We are accustomed to the phraseology of the epistles from our infancy; but we have either no idea at all when we use it, or our idea of it is derived from the articles or system which we have espoused. But as different facts have arbitrary definitions for St Paul's phrases, we shall never by following them discover the meaning of St Paul, who certainly did not adjust his phraseology to any man's system.\n\nThe best plan of studying the epistles is that which was proposed and executed by Mr Locke. This we shall present to our readers in the words of that acute and judicious author.\n\n\"After I had found by long experience, that the reading of the text and comments in the ordinary way proved not so successful as I wished to the end proposed, I began to suspect that in reading a chapter as was usual, and thereupon sometimes consulting expositors upon some hard places of it, which at that time most affected me, as relating to points then under consideration in my own mind, or in debate against others, was not a right method to get into the true sense of these epistles. I saw plainly, after I began once to reflect on it, that if any one should write me a letter as long as St Paul's to the Romans, concerning such a matter as that is, in a style as foreign, and expressions as dubious as his seem to be, if I should divide it into fifteen or sixteen chapters, and read one of them today, and another tomorrow, &c. it is ten to one I should never come to a full and clear comprehension of it. The way to understand the mind of him that writ it, every one would agree, was to read the whole letter through from one end to the other all at once, to see what was the main subject and tendency of it: or if it had several views and purposes in it, not dependent one of another, nor in a subordination to one chief aim and end, to discover what those different matters were, and where the author concluded one, and began another; and if there were any necessity of dividing the epistle into parts, to make the boundaries of them.\n\n\"In the prosecution of this thought, I concluded it necessary, for the understanding of any one of St Paul's epistles, to read it all through at one sitting, and to observe as well as I could the drift and design of his writing it. If the first reading gave me some light, the second gave me more; and so I persisted on reading constantly the whole epistle over at once till I came to have a good general view of the apostle's main purpose in writing the epistle, the chief branches of his discourse wherein he prosecuted it, the arguments he used, and the division of the whole.\n\n\"This, I confess, is not to be obtained by one or two hasty readings; it must be repeated again and again with a close attention to the tenor of the discourse, and a perfect neglect of the divisions into chapters and verses. On the contrary, the safest way is to suppose that the epistle has but one business and one aim, till by a frequent perusal of it you are forced to see there are distinct independent matters in it, which will forwardly enough show themselves.\n\n\"It requires so much more pains, judgement, and application, to find the coherence of obscure and abstruse writings, and makes them so much the more unfit to serve prejudice and preoccupation when found; that it is not to be wondered that St Paul's epistles have with many pained rather for disjointed, loose, pious discourses, full of warmth and zeal, and overflows of light, rather than for calm, strong, coherent reasonings, that carried a thread of argument and confidence all through them.\"\n\nMr Locke tells us he continued to read the same epistle over and over again till he discovered the scope of the whole, and the different steps and arguments by which the writer accomplishes his purpose. For he was convinced before reading his epistles, that Paul was a man of learning, of sound sense, and knew all the doctrines of the gospel by revelation. The speeches recorded in the Acts of the Apostles convinced this judicious critic that Paul was a close and accurate reasoner: and therefore he concluded that his epistles would not be written in a loose, confused, incoherent style. Mr Locke accordingly followed the chain of the apostle's discourse, observed his inferences, and carefully examined from what premises they were drawn, till he obtained a general outline of any particular epistle. If every divine would follow this method, he would soon acquire such a knowledge of Paul's style and manner, that he would peruse his other Epistles with much greater ease.\n\nThat the Epistle to the Romans was written at Corinth by St Paul, is ascertained by the testimony of the Roman Christians. It was composed in the year 58, in the 24th year after Paul's conversion, and is the seventh epistle which he wrote. From the Acts of the Apostles we learn that it must have been written within the space of three months; for that was the whole period of Paul's residence in Greece, (Acts xx. 1, 2, 3.)\n\nThe following analysis of this epistle we have taken from a valuable little treatise, intitled A Key to the New Testament, which was written by Dr Percy bishop of Dromore. It exhibits the intention of the apostle, and the arguments which he uses to prove his different propositions, in the most concise, distinct, and connected manner, and affords the best view of this Epistle that we have ever seen.\n\n\"The Christian church at Rome appears not to have General de- been planted by any apostle; wherefore St Paul, left it sign should be corrupted by the Jews, who then swarmed in Rome, and of whom many were converted to Christianity, fends them an abstract of the principal truths of the gospel, and endeavours to guard them against those erroneous notions which the Jews had of justification, and of the election of their own nation.\n\n\"Now the Jews assigned three grounds for justification. First, 'The extraordinary piety and merits of their ancestors, and the covenant made by God with these holy men.' They thought God could not hate the chil-\nScripture. dren of such meritorious parents; and as he had made a covenant with the patriarchs to bless their posterity, he was obliged thereby to pardon their sins.' Secondly, 'A perfect knowledge and diligent study of the law of Moses.' They made this plea for the remission of all their sins and vices. Thirdly, 'The works of the Levitical law,' which were to expiate sin, especially circumcision and sacrifices. Hence they inferred that the Gentiles must receive the whole law of Moses, in order to be justified and saved.\n\n'The doctrine of the Jews concerning election was, 'That as God had promised to Abraham to bless his seed, to give him not only spiritual blessings, but also the land of Canaan, to suffer him to dwell there in prosperity, and to consider him as his church upon earth:' That therefore this blessing extended to their whole nation, and that God was bound to fulfill these promises to them, whether they were righteous or wicked, faithful or unbelieving. They even believed that a prophet ought not to pronounce against their nation the prophecies with which he was inspired; but was rather to beg of God to expunge his name out of the book of the living.\n\nThese previous remarks will serve as a key to unlock this difficult Epistle, of which we shall now give a short analysis. See Michaelis's Lectures on the New Testament.\n\n'I. The Epistle begins with the usual salutation with which the Greeks began their letters, (chap. i. 1—7.)\n\n'II. St Paul professes his joy at the flourishing state of the church at Rome, and his desire to come and preach the gospel (ver. 8—19.): then he intensively introduces the capital point he intended to prove, viz.\n\n'III. The subject of the gospel (ver. 16, 17.), that it reveals a righteousness unknown before, which is derived solely from faith, and to which Jews and Gentiles have an equal claim.\n\n'IV. In order to prove this, he shows (chap. i. 18—iii. 20.) that both Jews and Gentiles are 'under sin,' i.e. that God will impute their sins to Jews as well as to Gentiles.\n\n'His arguments may be reduced to these following (chap. ii. 17—24.) 1. 'The wrath of God is revealed against those who hold the truth in unrighteousness; i.e. who acknowledge the truth, and yet sin against it. 2. The Gentiles acknowledged truths; but partly by their idolatry, and partly by their other detestable vices, they sinned against the truth they acknowledged. 3. Therefore the wrath of God is revealed against the Gentiles, and punisheth them. 4. The Jews have acknowledged more truths than the Gentiles, and yet they sin. 5. Consequently the Jewish sinners are yet more exposed to the wrath of God (ch. ii. 1—12. Having thus proved his point, he answers certain objections to it. Obj. 1. 'The Jews were well grounded in their knowledge, and studied the law.' He answers, If the knowledge of the law, without observing it, could justify them, then God could not have condemned the Gentiles, who knew the law by nature, (ch. ii. 13—16.) Obj. 2. 'The Jews were circumcised.' Ans. That is, ye are admitted by an outward sign into the covenant with God. This sign will not avail you when ye violate that covenant (ch. ii. 25, to the end). Obj. 3. 'According to this doctrine of St Paul, the Jews have no advantage before others.' Ans.\n\nYes, they still have advantages; for unto them are committed the oracles of God. But their privileges do not extend to this, that God should overlook their sins, which, on the contrary, Scripture condemns even in the Jews (ch. iii. 1—10.). Obj. 4. 'They had the Levitical law and sacrifices.' Ans. From hence is no remission, but only the knowledge of sin, (ch. iii. 20.).\n\n'V. From all this St Paul concludes, that Jews and Gentiles may be justified by the same means, namely, without the Levitical law, through faith in Christ: And in opposition to the imaginary advantages of the Jews, he states the declaration of Zechariah, that God is the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews, (ch. iii. 21. to the end.\n\n'VI. As the whole blessing was promised to the faithful descendents of Abraham, which both Scripture and the Jews call his children, he proves his former assertion from the example of Abraham; who was an idolater before his call, but was declared just by God, on account of his faith, long before his circumcision. Hence he takes occasion to explain the nature and fruits of faith, (ch. iv. 1. v. 11.).\n\n'VII. He goes on to prove from God's justice, that the Jews had no advantages over the Gentiles with respect to justification. Both Jews and Gentiles had forfeited life and immortality, by the means of one common father of their race, whom they themselves had not chosen. Now as God was willing to restore immortality by a new spiritual head of a covenant, viz. Christ, it was just that both Jews and Gentiles should share in this new representative of the whole race (ch. v. 12. to the end).—Chap. v. ver. 15, 16. amounts to this negative question, 'Is it not fitted that the free gift should extend as far as the offence?'\n\n'VIII. He shows that the doctrine of justification, as stated by him, lays us under the strongest obligations of holiness, (ch. vi. 1. to the end).\n\n'IX. He shows that the law of Moses no longer concerns us at all; for our justification arises from our appearing in God's sight, as if actually dead with Christ on account of our sins; but the law of Moses was not given to the dead. On this occasion he proves at large, that the eternal power of God over us is not affected by this; and that whilst we are under the law of Moses we perpetually become subject to death, even by sins of inadvertency, (ch. vii. 1. to the end).\n\n'X. Hence he concludes, that all those, and those only, who are united with Christ, and for the sake of his union, do not live according to the flesh, are free from all condemnation of the law, and have an undoubted share in eternal life, (ch. viii. 1.—17.).\n\n'XI. Having described their blessedness, he is aware that the Jews, who expected a temporal happiness, should object to him, that Christians notwithstanding endure much suffering in this world. He answers this objection at large, (ch. viii. 18 to the end).\n\n'XII. He shows that God is not the less true and faithful, because he doth not justify, but rather rejects and punishes, those Jews who would not believe the Messiah, (ch. ix. x. xi.). In discussing this point, we may observe the cautious manner in which, on account of the Jewish prejudices, he introduces it (ch. ix. 1.—5.), as well as in the discussion itself.\n\n'He shows that the promises of God were never made to all the posterity of Abraham, and that God al-\nScripture, ways referred to himself the power of choosing those sons of Abraham whom, for Abraham's sake, he intended to bless, and of punishing the wicked sons of Abraham; and that with respect to temporal happiness or misery, he was not even determined in his choice by their works. Thus he rejected Ishmael, Esau, the Israelites in the desert in the time of Moses, and the greater part of that people in the time of Isaiah, making them a sacrifice to his justice, (ch. ix. 6.—29.)\n\n\"He then proceeds to show, that God had reason to reject most of the Jews then living, because they would not believe in the Messiah, though the gospel had been preached to them plainly enough, (ch. ix. 30. x. to the end). However, that God had not rejected all the people, but was still fulfilling his promise upon many thousand natural descendants of Abraham, who believed in the Messiah, and would in a future period fulfill them upon more; for that all Israel would be converted, (ch. xi. 1—32.). And he concluded with admiring the wise councils of God, (ver. 33. to the end).\n\n\"XIII. From the doctrine hitherto laid down, and particularly from this, that God has in mercy accepted the Gentiles; he argues, that the Romans should consecrate and offer themselves up wholly to God. This leads him to mention in particular some Christian duties, (ch. xii.), viz.\n\n\"XIV. He exhorts them to be subject to magistrates (ch. xiii. 1—7.); the Jews at that time being given to sedition.\n\n\"XV. To love one another heartily (ver. 2—10.).\n\nAnd,\n\n\"XVI. To abstain from those vices which were considered as things indifferent among the Gentiles, (ver. 11. to the end).\n\n\"XVII. He exhorts the Jews and Gentiles in the Christian church to brotherly unity, (ch. xiv. 2. xv. 13.).\n\n\"XVIII. He concludes his Epistle with an excuse for having ventured to admonish the Romans, whom he had not converted; with an account of the journey to Jerusalem; and with some salutations to those persons whom he meant to recommend to the church at Rome.\"\n\nSee Michaelis's Lectures on the New Testament.\n\nCorinth was a wealthy and luxurious city, built upon the isthmus which joins the Morea to the northern parts of Greece. In this city Paul had spent two years founding a Christian church, which consisted of a mixture of Jews and Gentiles, but the greater part Gentiles.\n\nAbout three years after the apostles had left Corinth, he wrote this Epistle from Ephesus in the year 56 or 57, and in the beginning of Nero's reign. That it was written from Ephesus, appears from the salutation with which the Epistle closes, (chap. xvi. 19.). \"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord.\" From these words it is evident, in the first place, that the Epistle was written in Asia. 2dly, It appears from Acts xviii. 18, 19. that Aquila and Priscilla accompanied Paul from Corinth to Ephesus, where they seem to have continued till Paul's departure.\n\nSt Paul had certainly kept up a constant intercourse with the churches which he had founded; for he was evidently acquainted with all their revolutions. They seem to have applied to him for advice in those difficult cases which their own understanding could not solve; and he was ready on all occasions to correct their mistakes.\n\nThis Epistle consists of two parts. 1. A reproof General declaration for those vices to which they were most proper; sign of it. 2. An answer to some queries which they had proposed to him.\n\nThe Corinthians, like the other Greeks, had been accustomed to see their philosophers divide themselves into different sects; and as they brought along with them into the Christian church their former opinions and customs, they wished, as before, to arrange themselves under different leaders. In this Epistle Paul condemns these divisions as inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity, which inculcates benevolence and unity. The apostle declares, that the Christian truths were revealed from heaven; that they were taught with great plainness and simplicity, and proved by the evidence of miracles, (chap. i. 1.). He dissuades them from their divisions and animosities, by reminding them of the great trial which every man's work must undergo; of the guilt they incurred by polluting the temple or church of God; of the vanity of human wisdom; and of glorying in men. He admonishes them to esteem the teachers of the gospel only as the servants of Christ; and to remember that every superior advantage which they enjoyed was to be ascribed to the goodness of God, (chap. iii. 4.).\n\nIn the fifth chapter the apostle considers the case of a notorious offender, who had married his stepmother; and tells them, that he ought to be excommunicated. He also exhorts the Christians not to associate with any person who led such an openly profane life.\n\nHe censures the Corinthians for their litigious disposition, which caused them to prosecute their Christian brethren before the Heathen courts. He expresses much warmth and surprise that they did not refer their differences to their brethren; and concludes his exhortations on this subject, by assuring them that they ought rather to allow themselves to be defrauded than to seek redress from Heathens (chap. v. 1—9.).\n\nHe inveighs against those vices to which the Corinthians had been addicted before their conversion, and especially against fornication, the criminality of which they did not fully perceive, as this vice was generally overlooked in the fictions of the philosophers, (chap. vi. 10. to the end).\n\nHaving thus pointed out the public irregularities and abuses which they were chargeable, he next replies to certain questions which the Corinthians had proposed to him by letter. He, 1. Determines some questions relating to the marriage state; as, 1st, Whether it was good to marry under the existing circumstances of the church? And, 2d, Whether they should withdraw from their partners if they continued unbelievers? (chap. vii.).\n\n2. He instructs them how to act with respect to idol offerings. It could not be unlawful in itself to eat the food which had been offered to idols; for the consecration of flesh or wine to an idol did not make it the property of the idol, an idol being nothing, and therefore incapable...\nincapable of property. But some Corinthians thought it lawful to go to a feast in the idol temples, which at the same time were places of resort for lewdness, and to eat the sacrifices whilst praises were sung to the idol. This was publicly joining in the idolatry. He even advises to abstain from such participation as was lawful, rather than give offence to a weak brother; which he enforces by his own example, who had abstained from many lawful things, rather than prove a scandal to the gospel, (chap. viii. ix. x.).\n\n3. He answers a third query concerning the manner in which women should deliver anything in public, when called to it by a divine impulse. And here he censures the unusual dress of both sexes in prophesying, which exposed them to the contempt of the Greeks, among whom the men usually went uncovered and the women veiled.\n\nBeing thus led to the consideration of the abuses that prevailed in their public worship, he goes on to censure the irregularities which were committed at their love-feasts, or, as we term them, the Lord's Supper. It was a common practice with the Greeks at their social suppers for every man to bring his own provisions along with him, not, however, to share them with the company, but to feast on them in a solitary manner. Thus the rich ate and drank to excess, whilst the poor were totally neglected. The Corinthians introduced the same practice in the celebration of the Lord's Supper, thus confounding it with their ordinary meals, and without ever examining into the end of the institution. It was this gross abuse that Paul reproves in the 11th chapter. He also censures their conduct in the exercise of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost; he shows them they all proceeded from the same spirit, and were intended for the introduction of Christian societies; that all Christians ought to be united in mutual love; and that tenderness ought to be shown to the most inconsiderate member, as every one is subservient to the good of the whole (chap. xii.). In the 13th chapter he gives a beautiful description of benevolence, which has been much and justly admired. He represents it as superior to the supernatural gifts of the spirit, to the most exalted genius, to universal knowledge, and even to faith. In the 14th chapter he cautions the Corinthians against ostentation in the exercise of the gift of languages, and gives them proper advice.\n\n4. He affirms the resurrection of the dead, in opposition to some of the Corinthians who denied it, founding it on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, which he considers as one of the most essential doctrines of Christianity. He then answers some objections to the resurrection, drawn from our not being capable of understanding how it will be accomplished, (chap. xv.). He then concludes with some directions to the Corinthian church concerning the manner of collecting alms; promises them a visit, and salutes some of the members.\n\nThe second Epistle to the Corinthians was written from Macedonia in the year 57, about a year after the former. See 2 Cor. ix. 1—5, viii. and xiii. 1.\n\nSt Paul's first Epistle had wrought different effects among the Corinthians: many of them examined their conduct; they excommunicated the incestuous man; requested St Paul's return with tears; and vindicated him and his office against the false teacher and his adherents. Others of them still adhered to that adversary of St Paul, expressly denied his apostolic office, and even furnished themselves with pretended arguments from that Epistle. He had formerly promised to take a journey from Ephesus to Corinth, thence to visit the Macedonians, and return from them to Corinth (2 Cor. i. 15, 16). But the unhappy state of the Corinthian church made him alter his intention (verse 23.), since he found he must have treated them with severity. Hence his adversaries partly argued, 1. That St Paul was irreligious and unfeeling, and therefore could not be a prophet: 2. The improbability of his ever coming to Corinth again, since he was afraid of them. Such was the state of the Corinthian church when St Paul, after his departure from Ephesus, having visited Macedonia, (Acts xx. 1.), received an account of the above particulars from Titus (2 Cor. vii. 5, 6.), and therefore wrote them his second Epistle about the end of the same year, or the beginning of 58.\n\nBut to give a more distinct view of the contents of this Epistle:\n\n1. The apostle, after a general salutation, expresses his grateful sense of the divine goodness; professing his confidence in God, supported by a sense of his own integrity; makes an apology for not having visited the Corinthians as he had intended, and vindicates himself from the charge of fickleness, (chap. i.).\n\n2. He forgives the incestuous man, whose conduct had made so deep an impression on the apostle's mind, that one reason why he had deferred his journey to Corinth was, that he might not meet them in grief, nor till he had received advice of the effect of his apostolic admonitions. He mentions his anxiety to meet Titus at Troas, in order to hear of their welfare; expresses his thankfulness to God for the success attending his ministry, and speaks of the Corinthians as his credentials, written by the finger of God, (chap. ii. iii. 1.—6.).\n\n3. He treats of the office committed to him of preaching the redemption; and highly prefers it to preaching the law: to which probably his adversaries had made great pretences. They had ridiculed his sufferings; which he shows to be no disgrace to the gospel or its ministers; and here he gives a short abstract of the doctrine he preaches, (chap. iii. 6. v. to the end).\n\nHe expatiates with great copiousness on the temper with which, in the midst of afflictions and persecutions, he and his brethren executed their important embassy; and with great affection and tenderness he exhorts them to avoid the pollution of idolatry, (chap. vi.). He endeavours to win their confidence, by telling them how much he rejoiced in their amendment and welfare, and how sorry he had been for the distress which his necessary reproofs had occasioned, (chap. vii.). He then exhorts them to make liberal contributions for the Christians in Judea. He recommends to them the example of the Macedonians, and reminds them of the benevolence of the Lord Jesus. He expresses his joy for the readiness of Titus to assist in making the collection: and makes also honourable mention of other Christian brethren, whom he had joined with Titus in the same mission, chap. viii.). He then, with admirable address, urges a liberal contribution, and recommends them to the divine blessing, (chap. ix.).\n\n4. Next he obviates some reflections which had been thrown\nScripture thrown on him for the mildness of his conduct, as if it had proceeded from fear. He affirms his apostolic power and authority, cautioning his opponents against urging him to give too sensible demonstrations of it, (chap. x.). He vindicates himself against the insinuations of some of the Corinthians, particularly for having declined pecuniary support from the church; an action which had been ungenerously turned to his disadvantage. To show his superiority over those despising men who had opposed his preaching, he enumerates his sufferings; gives a detail of some extraordinary revelations which he had received; and vindicates himself from the charge of boasting, by declaring that he had been forced to it by the desire of supporting his apostolic character, (chap. xi. xii.). He closes the Epistle, by afflicting them with great tenderness how much it would grieve him to demonstrate his divine commission by severer methods.\n\nThe Galatians were descended from those Gauls who had formerly invaded Greece, and afterwards settled in Lower Asia. St Paul had preached the gospel among them in the year 51, soon after the council held at Jerusalem, (Acts xvi. 6.). Asia swarmed at that time with zealots for the law of Moses, who wanted to impose it on the Gentiles, (Acts xv. 1.). Soon after St Paul had left the Galatians, these false teachers had got among them, and wanted them to be circumcised, &c. This occasioned the following Epistle, which Michaelis thinks was written in the same year, before St Paul left Thessalonica. Dr Lardner dates it about the end of the year 52, or in the very beginning of 53, before St Paul set out to go to Jerusalem by way of Ephesus.\n\nThe subject of this Epistle is much the same with that of the Epistle to the Romans; only this question is more fully considered here, \"Whether circumcision, and an observance of the Levitical law, be necessary to the salvation of a Christian convert?\" It appears, these Judaizing Christians, whose indirect views St Paul exposes (Acts xv. 1. Gal. v. 3, 9.), at first only represented circumcision as necessary to salvation; but afterwards they insisted upon the Christians receiving the Jewish festivals, (Gal. iv. 10.).\n\nAs St Paul had founded the churches of Galatia, and instructed them in the Christian religion, he does not set before them its principal doctrines, as he had done in the Epistle to the Romans; but referring them to what he had already taught (chap. i. 8, 9.), he proceeds at once to the subject of the Epistle.\n\nAs it appears from several passages of this Epistle, particularly chap. i. 7, 8, 10. and chap. v. 11. that the Judaizing Christians had endeavoured to persuade the Galatians that Paul himself had changed his opinion, and now preached up the Levitical law; he denies that charge, and affirms that the doctrines which he had taught were true, for he had received them from God by immediate revelation. He relates his miraculous conversion; affirms his apostolic authority, which had been acknowledged by the disciples of Jesus; and, as a proof that he had never inculcated a compliance with the Mosaic law, he declares that he had opposed Peter at Antioch for yielding to the prejudices of the Jews.\n\nHaving now vindicated his character from the suspicion of fickleness, and shown that his commission was divine, he argues that the Galatians ought not to submit to the law of Moses; 1. Because they had received the Holy Ghost and the gift of miracles, not by the law, but by the gospel, (chap. iii. 1—5.). 2. Because by which the promises which God made to Abraham were not the apostle restricted to his circumcised descendants, but extended to all who are his children by faith, (chap. iii. 6—18.). Moses was In answer to the objection, To what then serveth the not obligation? he replies, That it was given because of transgression on the ground; that is, to preserve them from idolatry till the Messiah should come. 3. Because all men, whether Jews or Gentiles, are made the children of God by the Epistle of faith, or by receiving the Christian religion, and therefore do not stand in need of circumcision, (chap. iii. 26—29.). From the 11th verse of chap. iv. to the 11th, he argues that the law was temporary, being only fitted for a state of infancy; but that the world, having attained a state of manhood under the Messiah, the law was of no further use. In the remaining part of chapter iv. he reminds them of their former affection to him, and affirms that he was still their sincere friend. He exhorts them to stand fast in the liberty with which Christ had made them free; for the sons of Agar, that is, those under the law given at Mount Sinai, are in bondage, and to be cast out; the inheritance being designed for those only who are the free-born sons of God under the spiritual covenant of the gospel.\n\nThe apostle next confutes the false report which had been spread abroad among the Galatians, that Paul himself preached up circumcision. He had already indirectly refuted this calumny by the particular account from which he gave of his life; but he now directly and positively, openly contradicts it in the following manner:\n\n1. By afflicting them, that all who thought circumcision necessary to salvation could receive no benefit from the Christian religion, (chap. v. 2—4.).\n\n2. By declaring, that he expected justification only by faith, (verse 5, 6.).\n\n3. By testifying, that they had once received the truth, and had never been taught such false doctrines by him, (verse 7, 8.).\n\n4. By inferring that they should pass some censure on those who misled them (ver. 9, 10.), by declaring that he was persecuted for opposing the circumcision of the Christians, (ver. 11.).\n\n5. By expressing a wish that those persons should be cut off who troubled them with his doctrine.\n\nThis Epistle affords a fine instance of Paul's skill in managing an argument. The chief objection which the advocates for the Mosaic law had urged against him was, that he himself preached circumcision. In the beginning of the Epistle he overturns this slander by a statement of facts, without taking any express notice of it; but at the end fully refutes it, that it might leave a strong and lasting impression on their minds.\n\nHe next cautions them against an idea which his arguments for Christian liberty might excite, that it consisted in licentiousness. He shows them it does not consist in gratifying vicious desires; for none are under stronger obligations to moral duties than the Christian. He recommends gentleness and meekness to the weak (chap. vi. 1—5.), and exhorts them to be liberal to their teachers, and to all men (ver. 6—10.). He concludes\nconcludes with exposing the false pretences of the Judaizing teachers, and afflicting the integrity of his own conduct.\n\nEpheus was the chief city of all Asia on this side Mount Taurus. St Paul had passed through it in the year 54, but without making any stay, (Acts xviii. 19—21.) The following year he returned to Ephesus again, and stayed there three years, (chap. xix.) During his abode there he completed a very flourishing church of Christians, the first foundations of which had been laid by some inferior teachers. As Ephesus was frequented by persons of distinction from all parts of Asia Minor, St Paul took the opportunity of preaching in the ancient countries (ver. 10;) and the other churches of Asia were considered as the daughters of the church of Ephesus; so that an Epistle to the Ephesians was, in effect, an epistle to the other churches of Asia at the same time.\n\nDr Lardner shows it to be highly probable that this epistle was written in the year 61, soon after Paul's arrival at Rome.\n\nAs Paul was in a peculiar manner the apostle of the Gentiles, and was now a prisoner at Rome in consequence of having provoked the Jews, by affecting that an observance of the Mosaic law was not necessary to obtain the favour of God, he was afraid lest an advantage should be taken of his confinement to unsettle the minds of those whom he had converted. Hearing that the Ephesians stood firm in the faith of Christ, without submitting to the law of Moses, he writes this Epistle to give them more exalted views of the love of God, and of the excellence and dignity of Christ. This epistle is not composed in an argumentative or didactic style; the first three chapters consist almost entirely of thanksgivings and prayers, or glowing descriptions of the blessings of the Christian religion. This circumstance renders them a little obscure; but by the affluence of the two following epistles, which were written on the same occasion, and with the same design, the meaning of the epistle may be easily discovered. The last three chapters contain practical exhortations. He first inculcates unity, love, and concord, from the consideration that all Christians are members of the same body, of which Christ is the head. He then advises them to forsake the vices to which they had been addicted while they remained heathens. He recommends justice and charity; strenuously condemns lewdness, obscenity, and intemperance, vices which seem to have been too common among the Ephesians. In the 6th chapter he points out the duties which arise from the relations of husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants; and concludes with strong exhortations to fortitude, which he describes in an allegorical manner.\n\nThe church at Philippi had been founded by Paul, Silas, and Timothy (Acts xvi.), in the year 51, and had continued to show a strong and manly attachment to the Christian religion, and a tender affection for the apostle. Hearing of his imprisonment at Rome, they sent Epaphroditus, one of their pastors, to supply him with money. It appears from this epistle that he was in great want of necessaries before this contribution arrived; for as he had not converted the Romans, he did not consider himself as entitled to receive supplies from them. Being a prisoner, he could not work as formerly; and it was a maxim of his never to accept any pecuniary assistance from those churches where a faction had been raised against him. From the Philippians he was not averse to receive a present in the time of want, because he considered it as a mark of their affection, and because he was assured that they had conducted themselves as sincere Christians.\n\nIt appears from the apostle's own words, that this letter was written while he was a prisoner at Rome, (chap. i. 7, 13. iv. 22.) and from the expectation which he discovers (chap. ii. 24.) of being soon released and restored to them, compared with Philemon v. 22. and Heb. xiii. 13. where he expresses a like expectation in stronger terms, it is probable that this epistle was written towards the end of his first imprisonment in the year 62.\n\nThe apostle's design in this epistle, which is quite of the practical kind, seems to be, \"to comfort the Philippians under the concern they had expressed at the news of his imprisonment; to check a party-spirit that appears to have broken out among them, and to promote, on the contrary, an entire union and harmony of affection; to guard them against being seduced from the purity of the Christian faith by Judaizing teachers; to support them under the trials with which they struggled; and, above all, to inspire them with a concern to adorn their profession by the most eminent attainments in the divine life.\" After some particular admonitions in the beginning of the 4th chapter, he proceeds in the 8th verse to recommend virtue in the most extensive sense, mentioning all the different foundations in which it had been placed by the Grecian philosophers. Towards the close of the epistle, he makes his acknowledgements to the Philippians for the seasonable and liberal supply which they had sent him, as it was so convincing a proof of their affection for him, and their concern for the support of the gospel, which he preferred far above any private secular interest of his own; expressly disclaiming all selfish, mercenary views, and afflicting them with a noble simplicity, that he was able upon all occasions to accommodate his temper to his circumstances; and had learned, under the teachings of Divine grace, in whatever station Providence might see fit to place him, there-with to be content. After which, the apostle, having encouraged them to expect a rich supply of all their wants from their God and Father, to whom he devoutly ascribes the honour of all, concludes with salutations from himself and his friends at Rome to the whole church, and a solemn benediction, (ver. 19. to the end;) and declares, that he rejoiced in their liberality chiefly on their own account.\n\nThe epistle to the Colossians was written while Paul was in prison (chap. iv. 3.), and was therefore probably composed in the year 62. The intention of the apostle, and design as far as can be gathered from the epistle itself, was to secure the Colossians from the influence of some doctrines that were subversive of Christianity, and to excite them to a temper and behaviour worthy of their sacred character. A new sect had arisen, which had blended the oriental philosophy with the superstitious opinions of the Jews.\n\nThey held, 1. That God was surrounded by demons or angels, who were mediators with God, and therefore the Colossians to be worshipped. 2. That the soul is defiled by the body; that all bodily enjoyments hurt the foul, which they believed to be immortal, though they seem to have denied the Jews.\nScripture denied the resurrection of the body, as it would only render the soul sinful by being reunited to it.\n\n3. That there was a great mystery in numbers, particularly in the number seven; they therefore attributed a natural holiness to the seventh or Sabbath day, which they observed more strictly than the other Jews. They spent their time mostly in contemplation; abstained from marriage, and every gratification of the senses; used washings, and thought it sinful to touch certain things; regarded wine as poison, &c.\n\nThe arguments against these doctrines are managed with great skill and address. He begins with expressing great joy for the favourable character which he had heard of them, and affirms that he daily prayed for their farther improvement. Then he makes a short digression, in order to describe the dignity of Jesus Christ; declares that he had created all things, whether thrones or dominions, principalities and powers; that he alone was the head of the church, and had reconciled men to the Father. The inference from this description is evident, that Jesus was superior to angels; that they were created beings, and ought not to be worshipped. Thus he indirectly confutes one doctrine before he formally opposes it. Paul now returns from his digression in the 21st verse to the sentiments with which he had introduced it in the 13th and 14th verses, and again expresses his joy that the Philippians remained attached to the gospel, which was to be preached to the Gentiles, without the restraints of the ceremonial law. Here again he states a general doctrine, which was inconsistent with the opinions of those who were zealous for the law of Moses; but he leaves the Colossians to draw the inference, (chap. i.).\n\nHaving again assured them of his tender concern for their welfare, for their advancement in virtue, and that they might acknowledge the mystery of God, that is, that the gospel was to supersede the law of Moses, he proceeds directly to caution them against the philosophy of the new teachers, and their superstitious adherence to the law; shows the superiority of Christ to the angels, and warns Christians against worshipping them. He censures the observance of Sabbaths, and rebukes those who required abstinence from certain kinds of food, and cautions them against persons who assume a great appearance of wisdom and virtue, (chap. ii.).\n\nIn the 3d chapter he exhorts them, that, instead of being occupied about external ceremonies, they ought to cultivate pure morality. He particularly guards them against impurity, to which they had before their conversion been much addicted. He admonishes them against indulging the irascible passions, and against committing falsehood. He exhorts them to cultivate the benevolent affections, and humility, and patience. He recommends also the relative duties between husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants. He enjoins the duties of prayer and thanksgiving (chap. iv. 2.), and requests them to remember him in their petitions. He enjoins affability and mild behaviour to the unconverted heathens (verse 6th); and concludes the epistle with matters which are all of a private nature, except the directions for reading this epistle in the church of Laodicea, as well as in the church of Colosse.\n\nThis epistle is addressed to the inhabitants of Thessalonica, the capital of Macedonia, a large and populous city. It appears from the Acts, chapter xvi. 1, that the Christian religion was introduced into this city by Paul and Silas, soon after they had left Philippi. At first they made many converts; but at length the Jews, ever jealous of the admission of the Gentiles to the same privileges with themselves, stirred up the rabble, which assaulted the house where the apostle and his friends lodged; so that Paul and Silas were obliged to flee to Berea, where their success was soon interrupted by the same restless and implacable enemies. The apostle then withdrew to Athens; and Timothy, at his desire, returned to Thessalonica (1 Thess. iii. 2.), to see what were the sentiments and behaviour of the inhabitants after the persecution of the Jews. From Athens Paul went to Corinth, where he stayed a year and six months; during which, Timothy returned with the joyful tidings, that the Thessalonians remained steadfast to the faith, and firmly attached to the apostle, notwithstanding his flight. Upon this he sent them this epistle, A.D. 52, in the 12th year of Claudius.\n\nThis is generally reckoned the first epistle which Paul wrote; and we find he was anxious that it should be read to all the Christians. In chap. v. 27, he uses these words; \"I adjure you by the Lord, that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.\" This direction is very properly inserted in his first epistle.\n\nThe intention of Paul in writing this epistle was evidently to encourage the Thessalonians to adhere to the Christian religion. This church being still in its infancy, and oppressed by the powerful Jews, required to be established in the faith. St Paul, therefore, in the three first chapters, endeavours to convince the Thessalonians of the truth and divinity of his gospel, both by the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost which had been imparted, and by his own conduct when among them.\n\nWhile he appeals, in the first chapter, to the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit, he is very liberal in his commendations. He vindicates himself from the charge of timidity, probably to prevent the Thessalonians from forming an unfavourable opinion of his fortitude, which his flight might have excited. He affirms, that he was not influenced by selfish or dishonourable motives, but that he was anxious to please God and not man. He expresses a strong affection for them, and how anxious he was to impart the blessings of the gospel. He congratulates himself upon his success; mentions it to their honour that they received the gospel as the word of God and not of man, and therefore did not renounce it when persecution was raised by the Jews. He expresses a strong desire to visit the Thessalonians; and affirms they had been hitherto retained against his will.\n\nAs a farther proof of his regard, the apostle informs them, that when he came to Athens, he was so much concerned, least, being discouraged by his sufferings, they should be tempted to cast off their profession, that he could not forbear sending Timothy to comfort and strengthen them; and expresses, in very strong terms, the sensible pleasure he felt, in the midst of all his afflictions, from the favourable account he received of their faith and love; to which he adds, that he was continually praying for their farther establishment in religion, and for an opportunity of making them another visit, in order\norder to promote their edification, which lay so near his heart, (chap. iii. throughout).\n\nHaving now thrown his paternal affection for them, with great address he improves all that influence which his zeal and fidelity in their service must naturally have given him to inculcate upon them the precepts of the gospel. He recommends charity, in opposition to the prevailing practice of the heathens; justice, in opposition to fraud. He praises their benevolence, and encourages them to cultivate higher degrees of it. He recommends industry and prudent behaviour to their heathen neighbours. In order to comfort them under the loss of their friends, he affirms that those who were fallen asleep in Jesus should be raised again at the last day, and should, together with those who remained alive, be caught up to meet their Lord, and share his triumph, (chap. iv.). He admonishes them to prepare for this solemn event, that it might not come upon them unawares; and then concludes the epistle with various exhortations.\n\nThe second epistle to the Thessalonians appears to have been written soon after the first, and from the same place; for Silvanus or Silas, and Timothy, are joined together with the apostle in the inscriptions of this epistle, as well as of the former.\n\nThe apostle begins with commending the faith and charity of the Thessalonians, of which he had heard a favourable report. He expresses great joy on account of the patience with which they supported persecution; and observes that their persecution was a proof of a righteous judgement to come, where their persecutors would meet with their proper recompense, and the righteous be delivered out of all their afflictions. He affirms them of his constant prayers for their further improvement, in order to attain the felicity that was promised, (chap. i.).\n\nFrom misunderstanding a passage in his former letter, it appears that the Thessalonians believed the day of judgement was at hand. To rectify this mistake, he informs them that the day of the Lord will not come till a great apocalyptic has overpread the Christian world, the nature of which he describes (c). Symptoms of this mystery of iniquity had then appeared; but the apostle expresses his thankfulness to God that the Thessalonians had escaped this corruption. He exhorts them to steadfastness, and prays that God would comfort and strengthen them, (chap. ii.).\n\nHe requests the prayers of the Thessalonians for him and his two assistants, at the same time expressing his confidence that they would pay due regard to the instructions which he had given them. He then proceeds to correct some irregularities. Many of the Thessalonians seem to have led an idle disorderly life; these he severely reproves, and commands the faithful to shun their company if they still remained incorrigible.\n\nWhen the first Epistle to Timothy was written, it is difficult to ascertain. Lardner dates it in 56; Mill, Whitby, and Macknight, place it in 64: but the arguments on which each party founds their opinion are too long to infer here.\n\nTimothy was the intimate friend and companion of Paul, and is always mentioned by that apostle with much affection and esteem. Having appointed him to superintend the church of Ephesus during a journey which he made to Macedonia, he wrote this letter, in order to direct him how to discharge the important trust which was committed to him. This was the more necessary, as Timothy was young and inexperienced, (1 Tim. iv. 12.). In the beginning of the epistle he reminds him of the charge with which he had intrusted him, to wit, to preserve the purity of the gospel against the pernicious doctrines of the Judaizing teachers, whose opinions led to frivolous controversies, and not to a good life. He shows the use of the Law of Moses, of which these teachers were ignorant. This account of the law, he affirms Timothy, was agreeable to the representation of it in the gospel, with the preaching of which he was intrusted. He then makes a digression, in the fulness of his heart, to express the sense which he felt of the goodness of God towards him.\n\nIn the second chapter, the apostle prescribes the manner in which the worship of God was to be performed in the church of Ephesus; and in the third explains the qualifications of the persons whom he was to ordain as bishops and deacons. In the fourth chapter he foretells the great corruptions of the church which were to prevail in future times, and instructs him how to support the sacred character. In the fifth chapter he teaches Timothy how to admonish the old and young of both sexes; mentions the age and character of such widows as were to be employed by the society in some peculiar office; and subjoins some things concerning the respect due to elders. In the sixth chapter he describes the duties which Timothy was to inculcate on slaves; condemns trifling controversies and pernicious disputes; censures the excessive love of money, and charges the rich to be rich in good works.\n\nThat the second Epistle to Timothy was written from Rome is universally agreed; but whether it was written during his first or second imprisonment has been much disputed. That Timothy was at Ephesus or in Asia Minor when this Epistle was sent to him, appears from the frequent mention in it of persons residing at Ephesus. The apostle seems to have intended to prepare Timothy for those sufferings which he foresaw he would be exposed to. He exhorts him to constancy and perseverance, and to perform with a good conscience the duties of the sacred function.\n\nThe false teachers, who had before thrown this church into confusion, grew every day worse; insomuch that not only Hymenaeus, but Philetus, another Ephesian heretic, now denied the resurrection of the dead. They were led into this error by a dispute about words. At first they only annexed various improper significations to the word resurrection, but at last they denied it altogether (ii); pretending that the resurrection of the dead was only a resurrection from the death of sin, and so\n\n(c) For an explanation of this prophecy, Dr Hurd's Sermons may be consulted. He applies it to the papal power, to which it corresponds with astonishing exactness.\n\n(ii) This is by no means uncommon among men; to begin to dispute about the signification of words, and\nThis Epistle is addressed to Titus, whom Paul had appointed to preside over the church of Crete. It is difficult to determine either its date or the place from which it was sent. The apostle begins with reminding Titus of the reasons for which he had left him at Crete; and directs him on what principles he was to act in ordaining Christian pastors: the qualifications of whom he particularly describes. To show him how cautious he ought to be in selecting men for the sacred office, he reminds him of the arts of the Judaizing teachers, and the bad character of the Cretans (chapter i.).\n\nHe advises him to accommodate his exhortations to the respective ages, sexes, and circumstances, of those whom it was his duty to instruct; and to give the greater weight to his instructions, he admonishes him to be an example of what he taught (chap. ii.). He exhorts him also to teach obedience to the civil magistrate, because the Judaizing Christians affirmed that no obedience was due from the worshippers of the true God to magistrates who were idolaters. He cautions against contentiousness and contention, and recommends meekness; for even the best Christians had formerly been wicked, and all the blessings which they enjoyed they derived from the goodness of God. He then enjoins Titus strenuously to inculcate good works, and to avoid useless controversies; and concludes with directing him how to proceed with those heretics who attempted to sow dissension in the church.\n\nThe epistle to Philemon was written from Rome at the same time with the Epistles to the Colossians and Philippians, about A.D. 62 or 63. The occasion of the letter was this: Onesimus, Philemon's slave, had robbed his master and fled to Rome; where, happily for him, he met with the apostle, who was at that time a prisoner at large, and by his instructions and admonitions was converted to Christianity; and reclaimed to a sense of his duty. St Paul seems to have kept him for some considerable time under his eye, that he might be satisfied of the reality of the change; and, when he had made a sufficient trial of him, and found that his behaviour was entirely agreeable to his profession, he would not detain him any longer for his own private convenience, though in a situation that rendered such an affluence peculiarly desirable (compare ver. 13, 14.), but sent him back to his master; and, as a mark of his esteem, intrusted him, together with Tychicus, with the charge of delivering his Epistle to the church at Colosse, and giving them a particular account of the state of things at Rome, recommending him to them, at the same time, as a faithful and beloved brother (Col. iv. 9.).\n\nAnd as Philemon might well be supposed to be strongly prejudiced against one who had left his service in so infamous a manner, he sends him this letter, in which he employs all his influence to remove his suspicions, and reconcile him to the thoughts of taking Onesimus into his family again. And whereas St Paul might have exerted that authority which his character as an apostle, and the relation in which he stood to Philemon as a spiritual father, would naturally give him, he chooses to entreat him as a friend; and with the loftiest and most inflaming addresses urges his suit, conjuring him by all the ties of Christian friendship that he would not deny him his request: and the more effectually to prevail upon him, he represents his own peace and happiness as deeply interested in the event; and speaks of Onesimus in such terms as were best adapted to soften his prejudices, and dispose him to receive one who was so dear to himself, not merely as a servant, but as a fellow Christian and a friend.\n\nIt is impossible to read over this admirable Epistle, without being touched with the delicacy of sentiment, and address and the matterly address that appear in every part of it, which we see here, in a most striking light, how perfectly consistent true politeness is, not only with all the warmth and sincerity of the friend, but even with the dignity of the Christian and the apostle. And if this letter were to be considered in no other view than as a mere human composition, it must be allowed a master-piece in its kind. As an illustration of this remark, it may not be improper to compare it with an epistle of Pliny, that seems to have been written upon a similar occasion, (lib. ix. lit. 21); which, though penned by one that was reckoned to excel in the epistolary style, and though it has undoubtedly many beauties, yet must be acknowledged, by every impartial reader, vastly inferior to this animated composition of the apostle.\n\nThe epistle to the Hebrews has been generally ascribed to Paul; but the truth of this opinion has been suspected by others, for three reasons: 1. The name of the writer is nowhere mentioned, neither in the beginning nor in any other part of the Epistle. 2. The style is said to be more elegant than Paul's. 3. There are expressions in the Epistle which have been thought unsuitable to an apostle's character. In answer to the first objection, Clemens Alexandrinus has assigned a very good reason: \"Writing to the Hebrews (i.e., he) who had conceived a prejudice against him, and were suspicious of him, he wisely declined setting his name at the beginning, lest he should offend them.\" 2. Origen and Jerome admired the elegance of the style, and reckoned it superior to that which Paul has exhibited in his Epistles: but as ancient testimony had assigned it to Paul, they endeavoured to answer the objection, by supposing that the sentiments were the apostle's, but the language and composition the work of some other person. If the Epistle, however, be a translation, which we believe it to be, the elegance of the language may belong to the translator. As to the composition and arrangement, it cannot be denied that there are many specimens in the writings of this apostle not inferior to be led gradually to deny the thing signified. This appears to have been the cause of most disputes, and the general beginning of scepticism and infidelity.\nScripture, inferior in these qualities to the Epistle to the Hebrews.\n\n3. It is objected, that in Heb. ii. 3, the writer of this Epistle joins himself with those who had received the gospel from Christ's apostles. Now Paul had it from Christ himself. But Paul often appeals to the testimony of the apostles in support of those truths which he had received from Revelation. We may instance 1 Cor. xv. 5, 6, 7, 8; 2 Tim. ii. 2.\n\nThis Epistle is not quoted till the end of the second century, and even then does not seem to have been universally received. This silence might be owing to the Hebrews themselves, who supposing this letter had no relation to the Gentiles, might be at pains to diffuse copies of it. The authors, however, on whose testimony we receive it as authentic, are entitled to credit; for they lived so near the age of the apostles, that they were in no danger of being imposed on; and from the numerous list of books which they rejected as spurious, we are assured that they were very careful to guard against imposition. It is often quoted as Paul's by Clemens Alexandrinus, about the year 194. It is received and quoted as Paul's by Origen, about 230; by Dionysius bishop of Alexandria in 247; and by a numerous list of succeeding writers.\n\nThe Epistle to the Hebrews was originally written in Hebrew, or rather Syro-Chaldaic; a fact which we believe on the testimony of Clemens Alexandrinus, Jerome, and Eusebius. To this it has been objected, that as these writers have not referred to any authority, we ought to consider what they say on this subject merely as an opinion. But as they state no reasons for adopting this opinion, but only mention as a fact that Paul wrote to the Hebrews in their native language, we must allow that it is their testimony which they produce, and not their opinion. Eusebius informs us, that some supposed Luke the Evangelist, and others Clemens Romanus, to have been the translator.\n\nAccording to the opinion of ancient writers, particularly Clemens Alexandrinus, Jerome, and Euthalius, this Epistle was addressed to the Jews in Palestine.—The scope of the Epistle confirms this opinion.\n\nHaving now given sufficient evidence that this Epistle was written by Paul, the time when it was written may be easily determined. For the salutation from the saints of Italy (chap. iv. 24), together with the apostle's promise to see the Hebrews (ver. 23), plainly intimate, that his confinement was then either ended or on the eve of being ended. It must therefore have been written soon after the Epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, and Philippians, and not long before Paul left Italy, that is, in the year 61 or 62.\n\nAs the zealous defenders of the Mosaic law would naturally insist on the divine authority of Moses, on the majesty and glory attending its promulgation by the ministry of angels, and the great privileges it afforded those who adhered to it; the apostle shows,\n\nI. That in all these several articles Christianity had an infinite superiority to the law.\n\nThis topic he pursues from chap. i. to xi. wherein he reminds the believing Hebrews of the extraordinary favour shown them by God, in sending them a revelation by his own son, whose glory was far superior to that of angels (chap. i. throughout); very naturally inferring from hence the danger of despising Christ on account of his humiliation, which, in perfect consistency with his dominion over the world to come, was voluntarily submitted to by him for our sakes and important reasons; particularly to deliver us from the fear of death, and to encourage the freedom of our access to God (chap. ii. throughout). With the same view he magnifies Christ as superior to Moses, their great legislator; and from the punishment inflicted on those who rebelled against the authority of Moses, infers the danger of contemning the promises of the gospel (chap. iii. 2—13.). And as it was an easy transition to call to mind on this occasion that rest in Canaan to which the authority invested in Moses was intended to lead them; the apostle hence cautions them against unbelief, as what would prevent their entering into a superior state of rest to what the Jews ever enjoyed (chap. iii. 14—iv. 11.). This caution is still farther enforced by awful views of God's omniscience, and a lively representation of the high-priesthood of Christ (chap. iv. to the end; and chap. v. throughout). In the next place, he intimates the very hopeless situation of those who apostatise from Christianity (chap. vi. 1—9.); and then, for the comfort and confirmation of sincere believers, displays to them the goodness of God, and his faithful adherence to his holy engagements; the performance of which is sealed by the entrance of Christ into heaven as our forerunner (chap. vi. 9. to the end). Still farther to illustrate the character of our Lord, he enters into a parallel between him and Melchizedec as to their title and descent; and, from instances wherein the priesthood of Melchizedec excelled the Levitical, infers, that the glory of the priesthood of Christ surpassed that under the law (chap. vii. 1—17). From these premises the apostle argues, that the Aaronical priesthood was not only excelled, but consummated by that of Christ, to which it was only introductory and subservient; and, of course, that the obligation of the law was henceforth dissolved (chap. vii. 18. to the end). Then recapitulating what he had already demonstrated concerning the superior dignity of Christ's priesthood, he thence illustrates the distinguished excellence of the new covenant, as not only foretold by Jeremiah, but evidently enriched with much better promises than the old (ch. viii. throughout): Explaining farther the doctrine of the priesthood and intercession of Christ, by comparing it with what the Jewish high-priests did on the great day of atonement (chap. ix. 1—14.). Afterwards he enlarges on the necessity of shedding Christ's blood, and the sufficiency of the atonement made by it (chap. ix. 15. to the end); and proves that the legal ceremonies could not by any means purify the conscience: whence he infers the insufficiency of the Mosaic law, and the necessity of looking beyond it (chap. x. 1—15.). He then urges the Hebrews to improve the privileges which such a high-priest and covenant conferred on them, to the purposes of approaching God with confidence, to a constant attendance on his worship, and most benevolent regards to each other (chap. x. 15—25.).\n\nThe apostle having thus obviated the insinuations and objections of the Jews, for the satisfaction and establishment of the believing Hebrews, proceeds,\n\nII. To prepare and fortify their minds against the form of persecution which in part had already befallen them, which was likely to continue and be often renewed; he reminds them of those extremities they had endured, and of the fatal effects which would attend their rude apostacy.\nScripture, apolacy (chap. x. 26. to the end); calling to their remembrance the eminent examples of faith and fortitude exhibited by holy men, and recorded in the Old Testament (chap. xi. 1—29.). He concludes his discourse with glancing at many other illustrious worthies; and, besides those recorded in Scripture, refers to the case of several who suffered under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Maccab. chap. viii. &c. chap. xi. 30. xii. 2.).\n\nHaving thus finished the argumentative part of the Epistle, the apostle proceeds to a general application; in which he exhorts the Hebrew Christians to patience, peace, and holiness (chap. xii. 3—14.); cautions them against secular views and sensual gratifications, by laying before them the incomparable excellency of the blessings introduced by the gospel, which even the Jewish economy, glorious and magnificent as it was, did by no means equal; exhorts them to brotherly affection, purity, compassion, dependence on the divine care, steadfastness in the profession of truth, a life of thankfulness to God, and benevolence to man: and concludes the whole with recommending their pious ministers to their particular regard, intreating their prayers, saluting and granting them his usual benediction.\n\nThe seven following Epistles, one of James, two of Peter, three of John, and one of Jude, have been distinguished by the appellation of catholic or general epistles, because most of them are inscribed, not to particular churches or persons, but to the body of Jewish or Gentile converts over the world. The authenticity of some of these has been frequently questioned, viz. the Epistle of James, the second of Peter, the Epistle of Jude, and the second and third of John. The ancient Christians were very cautious in admitting any books into their canon whose authenticity they had any reason to suspect. They rejected all the writings forged by heretics in the name of the apostles, and certainly, therefore, would not receive any without first subjecting them to a severe scrutiny. Now, though these five epistles were not immediately acknowledged as the writings of the apostles, this only shows that the persons who doubted had not received complete and incontestable evidence of their authenticity. But as they were afterwards universally received, we have every reason to conclude, that upon a strict examination they were found to be the genuine productions of the apostles. The truth is, so good an opportunity had the ancient Christians of examining this matter, so careful were they to guard against imposition, and so well founded was their judgment concerning the books of the New Testament, that, as Dr Lardner observes, no writing which they pronounced genuine has yet been proved spurious, nor have we at this day the least reason to believe any book genuine which they rejected.\n\nThat the Epistle of James was written in the apostolic age is proved by the quotations of ancient authors. Clemens Romanus and Ignatius seem to have made references to it. Origen quotes it once or twice.—There are several reasons why it was not more generally quoted by the first Christian writers. Being written to correct the errors and vices which prevailed among the Jews, the Gentiles might think it of less importance to them, and therefore take no pains to procure copies of it. As the author was sometimes denominated James the Just, and often called bishop of Jerusalem, it might be doubted whether he was one of the apostles. But its authenticity does not seem to have been suspected on account of the doctrines which it contains. In modern times, indeed, Luther called it a frowzy epistle (epistolae framinacea), and excluded it from the sacred writings, on account of its apparent opposition to the apostle Paul concerning justification by faith.\n\nThis Epistle could not be written by James the Elder, the son of Zebedee, and brother of John, who was beheaded by Herod in the year 44, for it contains passages which refer to a later period. It must, therefore, have been the composition of James the Less, the son of Alphaeus, who was called the Lord's brother, because he was the son of Mary, the sister of our Lord's mother. As to the date of this Epistle, Lardner fixes it in the year 61 or 62.\n\nJames the Less statedly resided at Jerusalem, whence he hath been styled by some ancient fathers bishop of that city, though without sufficient foundation. Now Doddridge, James being one of the apostles of the circumcision, while he confined his personal labours to the inhabitants of Judea, it was very natural for him to endeavour by his writings to extend his services to the Jewish Christians who were dispersed abroad in more distant regions. For this purpose, there are two points which the apostle seems to have principally aimed at, though he hath not pursued them in an orderly and logical method, but in the free epistolary manner, handling them jointly or distinctly as occasions naturally offered. And these were, \"to correct those errors both in doctrine and practice into which the Jewish Christians had fallen, which might otherwise have produced fatal consequences; and then to establish the faith and animate the hope of sincere believers, both under their present and their approaching sufferings.\"\n\nThe opinions which he is most anxious to refute are these, that God is the author of sin, (ch. i. 13.); that the belief of the doctrines of the gospel was sufficient to procure the favour of God for them, however deficient they were in good works, (ch. ii.). He dissuades the Jews from aspiring to the office of teachers in the third chapter, because their prejudices in favour of the law of Moses might induce them to pervert the doctrines of the gospel. He therefore guards them against the sins of the tongue, by representing their pernicious effects; and as they thought themselves wise and intelligent, and were ambitious of becoming teachers, he advises them to make good their pretensions, by showing themselves possessed of that wisdom which is from above, (ch. iii.).\n\nThe destruction of Jerusalem was now approaching; the Jews were split into factions, and often slaughtered one another; the apostle, therefore, in the fourth chapter, admonishes them to purify themselves from those vices which produced tumults and bloodshed. To rouse them to repentance, he foretells the miseries that were coming upon them. Lastly, He checks an irreligious spirit that seems to have prevailed, and concludes the Epistle with several exhortations.\n\nThe authenticity of the first Epistle of Peter has never been denied. It is referred to by Clemens of Rome, by Polycarp, and is quoted by Papias, Ire. Peter, Clemens Alexandrinus, and Tertullian. It is addressed to the strangers scattered through Pontus, &c., who are evidently Christians in general, as appears from chap.\nScripture, chap. ii. 10. \"In time past they were not a people, but are now the people of God.\" From Peter's sending the salutation of the church at Babylon to the Christians in Pontus, &c., it is generally believed that he wrote it in Babylon. There was a Babylon in Egypt and another in Assyria. It could not be the former, for it was an obscure place, which seems to have had no church for the first four centuries. We have no authority to affirm that Peter ever was in Assyria. The most probable opinion is that of Grotius, Whitby, Lardner, as well as of Eusebius, Jerome, and others, that by Babylon Peter figuratively means Rome. Lardner dates it in 63 or 64, or at the latest 65.\n\nSt Peter's chief design is to confirm the doctrine of St Paul, which the false teachers pretended he was opposing; and to assure the profane that they would be in the true grace of God, (ch. v. 12.). With this view he calls them elect; and mentions, that they had been declared such by the effusion of the Holy Ghost upon them, (ch. i. 1, 2.). He assures them that they were regenerate without circumcision, merely through the gospel and resurrection of Christ, (ver. 3, 4, 21—25); and that their sufferings were no argument of their being under the displeasure of God, as the Jews imagined, (ver. 6—12.). He recommends it to them to hope for grace to the end, (ver. 13.). He testifies, that they were not redeemed by the Paschal lamb, but through Christ, whom God had preordained for this purpose before the foundation of the world, (ver. 18—20.).\n\nThe second Epistle of Peter is not mentioned by any ancient writer extant till the fourth century, from which time it has been received by all Christians except the Syrians. Jerome acquaints us, that its authenticity was disputed, on account of a remarkable difference between the style of it and the former Epistle. But this remarkable difference in style is confined to the 2d chapter of the 2d Epistle. No objection, however, can be drawn from this circumstance; for the subject of that chapter is different from the rest of Peter's writings, and nothing is so well known than that different subjects suggest different styles. Peter, in describing the character of some flagitious impostors, feels an indignation which he cannot suppress: it breaks out, therefore, in the bold and animated figures of an oriental writer. Such a diversity of style is not uncommon in the best writers, especially when warmed with their subject.\n\nThis objection being removed, we contend that this Epistle was written by Peter, from the inscription, Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ. It appears from chap. i. 16, 17, 18, that the writer was one of the disciples who saw the transfiguration of our Saviour. Since it has never been ascribed to James or John, it must therefore have been Peter. It is evident, from chap. iii. 1, that the author had written an Epistle before to the same persons, which is another circumstance that proves Peter to be the author.\n\nIt is acknowledged, however, that all this evidence is merely internal; for we have not been able to find any external evidence upon the subject. If, therefore, the credit which we give to any fact is to be in proportion to the degree of evidence with which it is accompanied, we shall allow more authority to the gospels than to the epistles; more to those epistles which have been generally acknowledged than to those which have been controverted; and therefore no doctrine of Christianity ought to be founded solely upon them. It may also be added, that perhaps the best way of determining what are the essential doctrines of Christianity would be to examine what are the doctrines which occur oftener in the gospels; for the gospels are the plainest parts of the New Testament; and their authenticity is most completely proved. They are therefore best fitted for common readers. Nor will it be denied, we presume, that our Saviour taught all the doctrines of the Christian religion himself; that he repeated them on different occasions, and inculcated them with an earnestness proportionable to their importance. The Epistles are to be considered as a commentary on the essential doctrines of the gospel, adapted to the situation and circumstances of particular churches, and perhaps sometimes explaining doctrines of inferior importance. 1. The essential doctrines are therefore first to be sought for in the gospels, and to be determined by the number of times they occur. 2. They are to be sought for, in the next place, in the uncontroverted Epistles, in the same manner. 3. No essential doctrine ought to be founded on a single passage, nor on the authority of a controverted Epistle.\n\nThat Peter was old, and near his end, when he wrote this Epistle, may be inferred from chap. i. 14. \"Knowing that shortly I must put off this tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus has shewn me.\" Lardner thinks it was written soon after the former. Others, perhaps with more accuracy, date it in 67.\n\nThe general design of this Epistle is, to confirm the doctrine of doctrines and instructions delivered in the former; to excite the Christian converts to adorn, and steadfastly adhere to their holy religion, as a religion proceeding from God, notwithstanding the artifices of false teachers, whose character is at large described; or the persecution of their bitter and inveterate enemies.\"\n\nThe first Epistle of John is ascribed by the unanimous suffrage of the ancients to the beloved disciple of our Lord. It is referred to by Polycarp, is quoted by Papias, by Irenaeus, and was received as genuine by Clement of Alexandria, by Dionysius of Alexandria, by Cyprian, by Origen, and Eusebius. There is such a resemblance between the style and sentiments of this Epistle and those of the gospel according to John, as to afford the highest degree of internal evidence that they are the composition of the same author. In the style of this epistle there is a remarkable peculiarity, and especially in this Epistle. His sentences, considered separately, are exceeding clear and intelligible; but when we search for their connection, we frequently meet with greater difficulties than we do even in the Epistles of St Paul. The principal signature and characteristic of his manner is an artless and amiable simplicity, and a singular modesty and candour, in conjunction with a wonderful fulness of sentiment. His conceptions are apparently delivered to us in the order in which they arose to his own mind, and are not the product of artificial reasoning or laboured investigation.\n\nIt is impossible to fix with any precision the date of this Epistle, nor can we determine to what persons it was addressed.\n\nThe leading design of the apostle is to show the insufficiency of faith, and the external profession of religion, separate from morality; to guard the Christians to whom he writes against the delusive arts of the corrupters.\nScripture, rupers of Christianity, whom he calls Antichrist; and to inculcate universal benevolence. His admonitions concerning the necessity of good morals, and the inefficacy of external professions, are scattered over the Epistle, but are most frequent in the 1st, 2d, and 3d chapters. The enemies or corruptors of Christianity, against whom he contends, seem to have denied that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God (chap. ii. 22, v. 1.), and had actually come into the world in a human form, (chap. iv. 2, 3.). The earnestness and frequency with which this apostle recommends the duty of benevolence is remarkable. He makes it the distinguishing characteristic of the disciples of Jesus, the only sure pledge of our love to God, and the only assurance of eternal life, (chap. iii. 34, 15.). Benevolence was his favourite theme, which he affectionately pressed upon others, and constantly practised himself. It was conspicuous in his conduct to his great Master, and in the reciprocal affection which it inspired in his sacred breast. He continued to recommend it in his last words. When his extreme age and infirmities had so weakened his strength that he was incapable to exercise the duties of his office, the venerable old man, anxious to exert in the service of his Master the little strength which still remained, caused himself to be carried to church, and, in the midst of the congregation, he repeated these words, \"Little children, love one another.\"\n\nIt has been observed by Dr Mill that the second and third Epistles of John are so short, and resemble the first so much in sentiment and style, that it is not worth while to contend about them. The second Epistle consists only of 13 verses; and of these eight may be found in the first Epistle, in which the same or language is precisely the same.\n\nThe second Epistle is quoted by Irenaeus, and was received by Clemens Alexandrinus. Both were admitted by Athanasius, by Cyril of Jerusalem, and by Jerome. The second is addressed to a woman of distinction whose name is by some supposed to be Cyria (taking aqua for a proper name), by others Eucleia. The third is inscribed to Caius, or Caius according to the Latin orthography, who, in the opinion of Lardner, was an eminent Christian, that lived in some city of Asia not far from Ephesus, where St John chiefly resided after his leaving Judea. The time of writing these two Epistles cannot be determined with any certainty. They are so short that an analysis of them is not necessary.\n\nThe Epistle of Jude is cited by no ancient Christian writer extant before Clemens Alexandrinus about the year 194; but this author has transcribed eight or ten verses in his Stromata and Pedagogue. It is quoted once by Tertullian about the year 200; by Origen frequently about 230. It was not however received by many of the ancient Christians, on account of a supposed quotation from a book of Enoch. But it is not certain that Jude quotes any book. He only says that Enoch prophesied, saying, The Lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints. These might be words of a prophecy preserved by tradition, and inserted occasionally in different writings. Nor is there any evidence that there was such a book as Enoch's prophecies in the time of Jude, though a book of that name was extant in the second and third centuries. As to the date of this Epistle nothing beyond conjecture can be produced.\n\nThe design of it is, by describing the character of the false teachers, and the punishments to which they were liable, to caution Christians against listening to their suggestions, and being thereby perverted from the faith and purity of the gospel.\n\nThe Apocalypse or Revelation has not always been The Apocryphal Revelation has not always been received as the genuine production of the apostle John. Its authenticity is proved, however, by the testimony of many respectable authors of the first centuries. It is referred to by the martyrs of Lyons; it was admitted by Justin Martyr as the work of the apostle John. It is often quoted by Irenaeus, by Theophilus bishop of Antioch, by Clement of Alexandria, by Tertullian, by Origen, and by Cyprian of Carthage. It was also received by heretics, by Novatus and his followers, by the Donatists, and by the Arians. For the first two centuries no part of the New Testament was more universally acknowledged, or mentioned with higher respect. But a dispute having arisen about the millennium, Caius with some others, about the year 212, to end the controversy as speedily and effectually as possible, ventured to deny the authority of the book which had given occasion to it.\n\nThe book of Revelation, as we learn from Rev. i. 9. The date was written in the island of Patmos. According to the general testimony of ancient authors, John was banished into Patmos in the reign of Domitian, and restored by his successor Nerva. But the book could not be published till after John's release, when he returned to Ephesus. As Domitian died in 96, and his persecution did not commence till near the end of his reign, the Revelation might therefore be published in 96 or 97.\n\nHere we should conclude; but as the curious reader may Percy's desire to be informed how the predictions revealed in this book of St John have usually been interpreted and applied, we shall contentedly with our subject subjoin a key to the prophecies contained in the Revelation. This is extracted from the learned dissertations of Dr Newton, bishop of Bristol (1): to which the reader is referred for a more full illustration of the several parts, as the conciseness of our plan only admits a short analysis or abridgment of them.\n\nNothing of a prophetical nature occurs in the first three chapters except, 1. What is said concerning the church at Ephesus, that her \"candlestick shall be removed out of its place,\" which is now verified, not only in this, but churches in all the other Asiatic churches which existed at that which have time; the light of the gospel having been taken from them, not only by their heresies and divisions from within, but by the arms of the Saracens from without: And, 2. Concerning the church of Smyrna, that she shall \"have tribulation ten days;\" that is, in prophetic language,\n\n(1) Dissertations on the prophecies which have remarkably been fulfilled, and at this time are fulfilling, in the world, vol. iii. 8vo.\nScripture language, \"ten years;\" referring to the persecution of Diocletian, which alone of all the general persecutions lasted so long.\n\nThe next five chapters relate to the opening of the Seven Seals; and by these seals are intimated so many different periods of the prophecy. Six of these seals are opened in the sixth and seventh chapters.\n\nThe first seal or period is memorable for conquests. It commences with Vespasian, and terminates in Nerva; and during this time Judea was subjugated. The second seal is noted for war and slaughter. It commences with Trajan, and continues through his reign, and that of his successors. In this period, the Jews were entirely routed and dispersed; and great was the slaughter and devastation occasioned by the contending parties.\n\nThe third seal is characterized by a rigorous execution of justice, and an abundant provision of corn, wine, and oil. It commences with Septimius Severus. He and Alexander Severus were just and severe emperors, and at the same time highly celebrated for the regard they paid to the felicity of their people, by procuring them plenty of every thing, and particularly corn, wine, and oil. This period lasted during the reigns of the Septimian family.\n\nThe fourth seal is distinguished by a concurrence of evils, such as war, famine, pestilence, and wild beasts; by all which the Roman empire was remarkably infested from the reign of Maximin to that of Diocletian. The fifth seal begins at Diocletian, and is signalized by the great persecution, from whence arose that memorable era, the Era of Martyrs. With Constantine begins the sixth seal, a period of revolutions, pictured forth by great commotions in earth and in heaven, alluding to the subversion of Paganism and the establishment of Christianity. This period lasted from the reign of Constantine the Great to that of Theodosius the first. The seventh seal includes under it the remaining parts of the prophecy, and comprehends seven periods distinguished by the founding of seven trumpets.\n\nAs the seals foretold the state of the Roman empire before and till it became Christian, so the trumpets fore-show the fate of it afterwards; each trumpet being an alarm to one nation or other, rousing them up to overthrow that empire.\n\nFour of these trumpets are founded in the eighth chapter.\n\nAt the founding of the first, Alaric and his Goths invade the Roman empire, besiege Rome twice, and set it on fire in several places. At the founding of the second, Attila and his Huns waste the Roman provinces, and compel the eastern emperor Theodosius the second, and the western emperor Valentinian the third, to submit to shameful terms. At the founding of the third, Genseric and his Vandals arrive from Africa; spoil and plunder Rome, and set sail again with immense wealth and innumerable captives. At the founding of the fourth, Odoacer and the Heruli put an end to the very name of the western empire; Theodoric founds the kingdom of the Ostrogoths in Italy; and at last Italy becomes a province of the eastern empire, Rome being governed by a duke under the exarch of Ravenna. As the foregoing trumpets relate chiefly to the downfall of the western empire, so do the following to that of the eastern. They are founded in the ninth, tenth, and part of the eleventh chapters.\n\nAt the founding of the fifth trumpet, Mahomet, that blazing star, appears, or Scripture pens the bottomless pit, and with his locusts the Arabs darken the sun and air. And at the founding of the sixth, a period not yet finished, the four angels, that is, the four fultans, or leaders of the Turks and Othmans, are loosed from the river Euphrates. The Greek or Eastern empire was cruelly \"hurt and tormented\" under the fifth trumpet; but under the sixth, was \"slain,\" and utterly destroyed.\n\nThe Latin or Western Church not being reclaimed by the ruin of the Greek or Eastern, but still persisting in their idolatry and wickedness; at the beginning of the tenth chapter, and under the sound of this fifth trumpet, is introduced a vision preparative to the prophecies respecting the Western Church, wherein an angel is represented, having in his hand a little book, or codicil, describing the calamities that should overtake that church. The measuring of the temple shows, that during all this period there will be some true Christians, who will confine themselves to the rule of God's word, even whilst the outer court, that is, the external and more extensive part of this temple or church, is trodden under foot by Gentiles, i.e., such Christians as, in their idolatrous worship and persecuting practice, resemble and outdo the Gentiles themselves. Yet against these corruptors of religion there will always be some true witnesses to protest, who, however they may be overborne at times, and in appearance reduced to death, yet will arise again from time to time, till at last they triumph and gloriously ascend. The eleventh chapter concludes with the founding of the seventh trumpet.\n\nIn the twelfth chapter, by the woman bearing a man-child is to be understood the Christian church; by the great red dragon, the heathen Roman empire; by the man-child whom the woman bore, Constantine the Great; and by the war in heaven, the contests between the Christian and Heathen religions.\n\nIn the thirteenth chapter, by the beast with seven heads and ten horns, unto whom the dragon gave his power, seat, and great authority, is to be understood, not Pagan but Christian, not imperial but papal Rome; in submitting to whose religion, the world did in effect submit again to the religion of the dragon. The ten-horned beast therefore represents the Romish church and state in general; but the beast with two horns like a lamb is the Roman clergy; and that image of the ten-horned beast, which the two-horned beast caused to be made, and inspired with life, is the pope; whose number is 666, according to the numerical powers of the letters constituting the Roman name Latinus, or its equivalent in Hebrew, רומא Rōma.\n\nChapter xiv. By the lamb on Mount Zion is meant Jesus; by the hundred forty and four thousand, his church and followers; by the angel preaching the everlasting\nScripture lasting gospel, the first principal effort made towards a reformation by that public opposition formed against the worship of saints and images by emperors and bishops in the eighth and ninth centuries; by the angel crying, \"Babylon is fallen,\" the Waldenses and Albigenses, who pronounced the church of Rome to be the Apocalyptic Babylon, and denounced her destruction; and by the third angel Martin Luther and his fellow reformers, who protested against all the corruptions of the church of Rome, as destructive to salvation.

For proofs of their divine origin, see Religion, Prophecy, and Miracles.\n\nSCRIVENER, one who draws contracts, or whose business it is to place money at interest. If a scrivener be entrusted with a bond, he may receive the interest; and if he fail, the obligee shall bear the loss: and so it is if he receive the principal and deliver up the bond; for being entrusted with the security itself, it must be presumed that he is trusted with power to receive interest or principal; and the giving up the bond on payment of the money shall be a discharge thereof. But if a scrivener shall be entrusted with a mortgage-deed, he hath only authority to receive the interest, not the principal; the giving up the deed in this case not being sufficient to restore the estate, but there must be a reconveyance, &c. It is held, where a scrivener puts out his client's money on a bad security, which upon inquiry might have been easily found so, yet he cannot in equity be charged to answer for the money; for it is here said, no one would venture to put out money of another upon a security, if he were obliged to warrant and make it good in case a loss should happen, without any fraud in him.\n\nSCROBICULUS CORDIS, the same as Anticardium.\n\nSCROFANELLO, in Ichthyology, a name by which some have called a small fish of the Mediterranean, more usually known by the name of the Scorpiona.\n\nSCROLL, in Heraldry. See that article, chap. iv. sect. 9. When the motto relates to the crest, the scroll is properly placed above the achievement; otherwise it should be annexed to the escutcheon. Those of the order of knighthood are generally placed round shields.\n\nSCROPHULA, the King's Evil. See Medicine, No. 349.\n\nSCROPHULARIA, Figwort, a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia class, and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, Perforatae. See Botany Index.\n\nSCROTUM. See Anatomy, No. 220.\n\nSCRUPLE, Scrupulus, or Scrupulum, the least of the weights used by the ancients, which amongst the Romans was the 24th part of an ounce, or the 3rd part of a dram. The scruple is still a weight among us, containing the 3rd part of a dram, or 25 grains. Among goldsmiths it is 24 grains.\n\nSCRUPLE, in Chaldean Chronology, is 1/86 part of an hour, called by the Hebrews holakin. These scruples are much used by the Jews, Arabs, and other eastern people, in computations of time.\n\nSCRUPLES of half Duration, an arch of the moon's orbit, which the moon's centre describes from the beginning of an eclipse to its middle.\n\nSCRUPLES of Immersion or Incidence, an arch of the moon's orbit, which her centre describes from the beginning of the eclipse to the time when its centre falls into the flood.\n\nSCRUPLES of Emerion, an arch of the moon's orbit, which her centre describes in the time from the first emersion of the moon's limb to the end of the eclipse.\n\nSCRUTINY, (Scrutinium), in the primitive church, an examination or probation practised in the last week of Lent, on the catechumens, who were to receive baptism on the Easter-day. The scrutiny was performed with a great many ceremonies. Exorcisms and prayers were made over the heads of the catechumens; and on Palm Sunday, the Lord's Prayer and Creed were given them, which they were afterwards made to rehearse. This custom was more in use in the church of Rome than anywhere else; though it appears, by some authors, to have been likewise used, though much later, in the Gallican church. It is supposed to have ceased about the year 860. Some traces of this practice still remain at Vienne, in Dauphine, and at Liege.\n\nSCRUTINY, is also used, in the Canon Law, for a ticket or little paper billet, wherein at elections the electors write their votes privately, so as it may not be known for whom they vote. Among us the term scrutiny is chiefly used for a strict perusal and examination of the several votes hastily taken at an election; in order to find out any irregularities committed therein, by unqualified voters, &c.\n\nSCRUTORE, or Scrutoir (from the French escritoire), a kind of cabinet, with a door or lid opening downwards, for convenience of writing on, &c.\n\nSCRY, in falconry, denotes a large flock of fowl.\n\nSCUDDING, the movement by which a ship is carried precipitately before a tempest. As a ship flies with amazing rapidity through the water whenever this expedient is put in practice, it is never attempted in a contrary wind, unless when her condition renders her incapable of sustaining the mutual effort of the wind and waves any longer on her side, without being exposed to the most imminent danger of being over-set.\n\nA ship either feeds with a sail extended on her foremast, or, if the storm is excessive, without any sail; which, in the sea-phrase, is called scudding under bare poles. In sloops and schooners, and other small vessels, the sail employed for this purpose is called the square sail. In large ships, it is either the foreail at large, reefed, or with its goosenecks extended, according to the degree of the tempest; or it is the fore-top sail, close reefed, and lowered on the cap; which last is particularly used when the sea runs so high as to becalm the foreail occasionally, a circumstance which exposes the ship to the danger of broaching to. The principal hazards incident to scudding are generally, a pooping sea; the difficulty of steering, which exposes the vessel perpetually to the risk of broaching to; and the want of sufficient sea-room. A sea striking the ship violently on the stern may dash it inwards, by which she must inevitably founder. In broaching to (that is, inclining suddenly to windward), she is threatened with being immediately overturned; and, for want of sea-room, she is endangered.\nSCULPTURE,\n\nIs the art of carving wood or hewing stone into images. It is an art of the most remote antiquity, being practised, as there is reason to believe, before the general deluge. We are induced to assign to it this early origin, by considering the expedients by which, in the first stages of society, men have everywhere supplied the place of alphabetic characters. There, it is universally known, have been picture-writing, such as that of the Mexicans, which, in the progress of refinement and knowledge, was gradually improved into the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians and other ancient nations. See Hieroglyphics.\n\nThat mankind should have lived near 1700 years, from the creation of the world to the flood of Noah, without falling upon any method to make their conceptions permanent, or to communicate them to a distance, is extremely improbable; especially when we call to mind that such methods of writing have been found, in modern times, among people much less enlightened than those must have been who were capable of building such a vessel as the ark. But if the antediluvians were acquainted with any kind of writing, there can be little doubt of its being hieroglyphical writing. Mr Bryant has proved that the Chaldeans were possessed of that art before the Egyptians; and Beroeus informs us, that a delineation of all the monstrous forms which inhabited the chaos, when this earth was in that state, was to be seen in the temple of Belus in Babylon. This delineation, as he describes it, must have been a history in hieroglyphical characters; for it consisted of human figures with wings, with two heads, and some with the horns and legs of goats. This is exactly similar to the hieroglyphical writing of the Egyptians; and it was preserved, our author says, both in drawings and engravings in the temple of the god of Babylon. As Chaldee was the first peopled region of the earth after the flood, and as it appears from Pliny, as well as from Lib. vii. cap. Beroeus, that the art of engraving on bricks baked in the sun was there carried to a considerable degree of perfection at a very early period, the probability certainly is, that the Chaldeans derived the art of hieroglyphical writing, and consequently the rudiments of the art of sculpture, from their antediluvian ancestors.\n\nIt is generally thought that sculpture had its origin from idolatry, as it was found necessary to place before the people the images of their gods to enliven the fervour of their devotion; but this is probably a mistake. The worship of the heavenly bodies, as the only gods of the heathen nations, prevailed so long before the deification of dead men was thought of (see Polytheism), that we cannot suppose mankind to have been, during all that time, ignorant of the art of hieroglyphical writing. But the deification of departed heroes undoubtedly gave rise to the almost universal practice of representing the gods by images of a human form; and therefore we must conclude, that the elements of sculpture were known before that art was employed to enliven the devotion of idolatrous worshippers. The pyramids and obelisks of Egypt, which were probably temples, or rather altars, dedicated to the sun (see Pyramid), were covered from top to bottom with hieroglyphical emblems of men, beasts, birds, fishes, and reptiles, at a period prior to that in which there is any unexceptionable evidence that mere statue-worship prevailed even in that nursery of idolatry.\n\nBut though it appears thus evident that picture-writing was the first employment of the sculptor, we are far from imagining that idolatrous worship did not contribute to carry his art to that perfection which it attained in some of the nations of antiquity. Even in the dark ages of Europe, when the other fine arts were almost extinguished, the munificence of the church of Rome, and the veneration which she taught for her saints and martyrs, preserved among the Italians some vestiges of the finer-arts of sculpture and painting; and therefore, as human nature is everywhere the same, it is reasonable to believe that a similar veneration for heroes and demi-gods would, among the ancient nations, have a similar effect. But if this be so, the presumption is, that the Chaldeans were the first who invented the art of hewing blocks of wood and stone into the figures of men and other animals; for the Chaldeans were unquestionably the first idolaters, and their early progress in sculpture is confirmed by the united testimonies of Beroeus, Alexander Polyhistor, Apollodorus, and Pliny; not to mention the eastern tradition, that the father of Abraham was a statuary.\n\nAgainst this conclusion Mr Bromley, in his late History of the Fine Arts, has urged some plausible arguments; in stating these he professes not to be original, but to derive his information from the fountain-head of antiquity. He adopts, as he tells us, the theory of a French writer, who maintains, that in the year of the Scythians, 1499, about 3500 years after the deluge, the Scythians under Brouma, a descendant of Magog the son of Japhet, extended their conquests over the greater part of Asia. According to this system, Brouma was not only the civilizer of India, and the author of the Brahminical doctrines, but also diffused the principles of the Scythian mythology over Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece, and the continent of Asia.\n\nOf these principles Mr Bromley has given us no distinct enumeration; the account which he gives of them is not to be found in one place, but to be collected from a variety of distant passages. In attempting therefore to present the substance of his scattered hints in one view, we will not be confident that we have omitted none of them. The ox, says he, was the Scythian emblem of the generator of animal life, and hence it became the principal divinity of the Arabians. The serpent was the symbol of the source of intelligent nature. These were the common points of union in all the first religions.\nreligions of the earth. From Egypt the Israelites carried with them a religious veneration for the ox and the serpent. Their veneration for the ox appeared soon after they marched into the wilderness, when in the absence of Moses they called upon Aaron to make them gods which should go before them. The idea of having an idol to go before them, says our author, was completely Scythian; for so the Scythians acted in all their progress through Asia, with this difference, that their idol was a living animal. The Israelites having gained their favourite god, which was an ox (not a calf as it is rendered in the book of Exodus), next proceeded to hold a festival, which was to be accompanied with dancing; a species of gaiety common in the festivals which were held in adoration of the emblematic Urotox or ox in that very part of Arabia near Mount Sinai where this event took place. It is mentioned too as a curious and important fact, that the ox which was revered in Arabia was called Adonai. Accordingly Aaron announcing the feast to the ox or golden calf, speaks thus, tomorrow is a feast to Adonai, which is in our translation rendered to the Lord. In the time of Jeroboam we read of the golden calves set up as objects of worship at Bethel and Dan. Nor was the reverence paid to the ox confined to Scythia, to Egypt, and to Asia; it extended much farther. The ancient Cimbri, as the Scythians did, carried an ox of bronze before them on all their expeditions. Mr Bromley also informs us, that as great respect was paid to the living ox among the Greeks as was offered to its symbol among other nations.\n\nThe emblem of the serpent, continues Mr Bromley, was marked yet more decidedly by the express direction of the Almighty. That animal had ever been considered as emblematic of the supreme generating power of intelligent life: And was that idea, lays he, discouraged, so far as it went to be a sign or symbol of life, when God said to Moses, \"Make thee a brazen serpent, and set it on a pole, and it shall come to pass that every one who is bitten, when he looketh on it, shall live.\" In Egypt the serpent surrounded their Isis and Osiris, the diadems of their princes, and the bonnets of their priests. The serpent made a distinguished figure in Grecian sculpture. The fable of Echidna, the mother of the Scythians, gave her figure terminating as a serpent to all the founders of states in Greece; from which their earliest sculptors represented in that form the Titan princes, Cecrops, Draco, and even Ericthonius. Besides the spear of the image of Minerva, which Phidias made for the citadel of Athens, he placed a serpent, which was supposed to guard that goddefs.\n\nThe serpent was combined with many other figures. It sometimes was coiled round an egg as an emblem of the creation; sometimes round a trident, to show its power over the sea; sometimes it encircled a flambeau, to represent life and death.\n\nIn Egypt, as well as in Scythia and India, the divinity was represented on the leaves of the tamara or lotus. Pan was worshipped as a god in that country, as well as over the east. Their sphinxes, and all their combined figures of animal creation, took their origin from the mother of the Scythians, who brought forth an offspring that was half a woman and half a serpent. Their pyramids and obelisks arose from the idea of flame; the first emblem of the supreme principle, introduced by the Scythians, and which even the influence of Zoroaster and the Magi could not remove.\n\nWe are told that the Bacchus of the Greeks is derived from the Brouma of the Indians; that both are represented as seated on a swan swimming over the waves, to indicate that each was the god of humid nature, not the god of wine, but the god of waters. The mitre of Bacchus was shaped like half an egg; an emblem taken from this circumstance, that at the creation the egg from which all things sprung was divided in the middle. Pan also was revered among the Scythians; and from that people were derived all the emblems by which the Greeks represented this divinity.\n\nIt would be tedious to follow our author through the whole of this subject; and were we to submit to the labour of collecting and arranging his scattered materials, we should still view his system with some degree of suspicion. It is drawn, as he informs us, from the work of M. D'Ancarville, intitled, Recherches sur l'Origine, l'Esprit, et les Progres des Arts de la Grece.\n\nTo form conclusions concerning the origin of nations, founded on the rise and progress of the arts and sciences, without the aid of historical evidence, by analogies which are sometimes accidental, and often fanciful, is a mode of reasoning which cannot readily be admitted. There may indeed, we acknowledge, be resemblances in the religion, language, manners, and customs, of different nations, so striking and so numerous, that to doubt of their being descended from the same stock would favour of scepticism. But historical theories must not be adopted rashly. We must be certain that the evidence is credible and satisfactory before we proceed to deduce any conclusions. We must first know whether the Scythian history itself be authentic, before we make any comparison with the history of other nations. But what is called the Scythian history, every man of learning knows to be a collection of fables. Herodotus and Justin are the two ancient writers from whom we have the fullest account of that warlike nation; but these two historians contradict each other, and both write what cannot be believed of the same people at the same period of their progress. Justin tells us, that there was a long and violent contest between the Scythians and Egyptians about the antiquity of their respective nations; and after stating the arguments on each side of the question, which, as he gives them*, are nothing to the purpose, he decides in favour of the claim of the Scythians. Herodotus was too partial to the Egyptians, not to give them the palm of antiquity; and he was probably in the right; for Justin describes his most ancient of nations, even in the time of Darius Hytaphes, as ignorant of all the arts of civil life. \"They occupied their land in common (says he), and cultivated none of it. They had no houses nor settled habitations, but wandered with their cattle from desert to desert. In these rambles they carried their wives and children in tumbrils covered with the skins of beasts, which served as houseto protect them from the storms of winter. They were without laws, governed by the dictates of natural equity. They coveted not gold or silver like the rest of mankind, and lived upon milk and honey. Though they were exposed to extreme cold, and had abundance of flocks, they knew not how to make garments of wool, but clothed themselves in the skins of wild\nwild beasts.\" This is the most favourable account which any ancient writer gives of the Scythians. By Strabo and Herodotus they are represented as the most savage of mortals, delighting in war and bloodshed, cutting the throats of all strangers who came among them, eating their flesh, and making cups and pots of their skulls. Is it conceivable that such savages could be sculptors; or that, even supposing their manners to have been such as Justin represents them, a people so simple and ignorant could have imposed their mythology upon the Chaldeans, Phenicians, and Egyptians, whom we know by the most incontrovertible evidence to have been great and polished nations so early as in the days of Abraham? No! We could as soon admit other novelties of more importance, with which the French of the present age pretend to enlighten the world, as this origin assigned by Mr Bromley to the art of sculpture, unless supported by better authority than that of D'Ancarville.\n\nThe inference of our author from the name of the sacred ox in Arabia, and from the dancing and gaiety which were common in the religious festivals of the Arabians, appears to us to be very hastily drawn. At the early period of the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, the language of the Hebrews, Egyptians, and Arabians, differed not more from each other than do the different dialects of the Greek tongue which are found in the poems of Homer (see Philology, Sect. III.) and it is certain, that for many years after the formation of the golden-calf, the Hebrews were strangers to every species of idolatry but that which they had brought with them from their house of bondage. See Remphan.\n\nTaking for granted, therefore, that the Scythians did not impose their mythology on the eastern nations, and that the art of sculpture, as well as hieroglyphic writing and idolatrous worship, prevailed first among the Chaldeans, we shall endeavour to trace the progress of this art through some other nations of antiquity, till we bring it to Greece, where it was carried to the highest perfection to which it has yet attained.\n\nThe first intimation that we have of the art of sculpture is in the book of Genesis, where we are informed, that when Jacob, by the divine command, was returning to Canaan, his wife Rachel carried along with her the teraphim or idols of her father. These we are assured were small, since Rachel found it easy to conceal them from her father, notwithstanding his anxious search. We are ignorant, however, how these images were made, or of what materials they were composed. The first person mentioned as an artist of eminence is Bezaleel, who formed the cherubims which covered the mercy-seat.\n\nThe Egyptians also cultivated the art of sculpture; but there were two circumstances which obstructed its progress, 1. The persons of the Egyptians were not possessed of the graces of form, of elegance, or of symmetry; and of consequence they had no perfect standard to model their taste. They resembled the Chinese in the cast of their face, in their great bellies, and in the clumsy rounding of their contours. 2. They were restrained by their laws to the principles and practices of their ancestors, and were not permitted to introduce any innovations. Their statues were always formed in the same stiff attitude, with the arms hanging perpendicular ly down the sides. What perfection were they capable of who knew no other attitude than that of chairmen? So far were they from attempting any improvements, that in the time of Adrian the art continued in the same rude state as at first; and when their flattery adulation for that emperor induced them to place the statue of his favourite Antinous among the objects of their worship, the same inanimate stiffness in the attitude of the body and position of the arms was observed. We believe it will scarcely be necessary to inform our readers that the Egyptian statue just now mentioned is very different from the celebrated statue of Antinous, of which so many moulds have been taken that imitations of it are now to be met with almost in every cabinet in Europe.\n\nNotwithstanding the attachment of the Egyptians to ancient usages, Winkelmann thinks he has discovered two different styles of sculpture which prevailed at different periods. The first of these ends with the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses. The second begins at that time, and extends beyond the reign of Alexander the Great. In the first style, the lines which form the contour are First style, straight and projecting a little; the position is stiff and unnatural: In fitting figures the legs are parallel, the feet squeezed together, and the arms fixed to the sides; but in the figures of women the left arm is folded across the breast; the bones and muscles are faintly discernible; the eyes are flat and looking obliquely, and the eyebrows sunk—features which destroy entirely the beauty of the head; the cheek-bones are high, the chin small and piked; the ears are generally placed higher than in nature, and the feet are too large and flat. In short, if we are to look for any model in the statues of Egypt, it is not for the model of beauty but of deformity. The statues of men are naked, only they have a short apron, and a few folds of drapery surrounding their waist: The vestments of women are only distinguishable by the border, which rises a little above the surface of the statue. In this age it is evident the Egyptians knew little of drapery.\n\nOf the second style of sculpture practiced among the Second Egyptians, Winkelmann thinks he has found specimens style, in the two figures of basons in the Capitol, and in another figure at Villa Albani, the head of which has been renewed. The first two of these, he remarks, bear visible traces of the former style, which appear especially in the form of the mouth and shortness of the chin. The hands possess more elegance; and the feet are placed at a greater distance from each other, than was customary in more ancient times. In the first and third figures the arms hang down close to the sides. In the second they hang more freely. Winkelmann suspects that these three statues have been made after the conquest of Egypt by the Greeks. They are clothed with a tunic, a robe, and a mantle. The tunic, which is puckered into many folds, descends from the neck to the ground. The robe in the first and third statues seems close to the body, and is only perceptible by some little folds. It is tied under the breast, and covered by the mantle, the two buttons of which are placed under the epaulet.\n\nThe Antinous of the Capitol is composed of two pieces, which are joined under the haunches. But as all the Egyptian statues which now remain have been hewn out of one block, we must believe that Diodorus,\nin faying the flone was divided, and each half finifhed by a separate artifan, spoke only of a colofius. The fame author informs us, that the Egyptians divided the human body into 24 parts; but it is to be regretted that he has not given a more minute detail of that division.\n\nThe Egyptian statues were not only formed by the chief, they were also polished with great care. Even those on the summit of an obelisk, which could only be viewed at a distance, were finifhed with as much labour and care as if they had admitted a close inspection. As they are generally executed in granite or basalt, stones of a very hard texture, it is impossible not to admire the indefatigable patience of the artists.\n\nThe eye was often of different materials from the rest of the statue; sometimes it was composed of a precious stone or metal. We are assured that the valuable diamond of the empress of Russia, the largest and most beautiful hitherto known, formed one of the eyes of the famous statue of Scheringham in the temple of Bra-\n\nThose Egyptian statues which still remain are composed of wood or baked earth; and the statues of earth are covered with green enamel.\n\nThe Phenicians possessed both a character and situation highly favourable to the cultivation of statuary. They had beautiful models in their own persons, and their industrious character qualified them to attain perfection in every art for which they had a taste. Their situation raised a spirit of commerce, and commerce induced them to cultivate the arts. Their temples thone with statues and columns of gold, and a profusion of emeralds was everywhere scattered. All the great works of the Phenicians have been unfortunately destroyed; but many of the Carthaginian medals are still preserved, ten of which are deposited in the cabinet of the grand duke of Florence. But though the Carthaginians were a colony of Phenicians, we cannot from their works judge of the merit of their ancestors.\n\nThe Persians made no distinguished figure in the arts of design. They were indeed sensible to the charms of beauty, but they did not study to imitate them. Their dress, which consisted of long flowing robes concealing the whole person, prevented them from attending to the beauties of form. Their religion, too, which taught them to worship the divinity in the emblem of fire, and that it was impious to represent him under a human form, seemed almost to prohibit the exercise of this art, by taking away those motives which alone could give it dignity and value; and as it was not customary among them to raise statues to great men, it was impossible that statuary could flourish in Persia.\n\nThe Etrurians or ancient Tuscan, in the opinion of Winkelmann, carried this art to some degree of perfection at an earlier period than the Greeks. It is said to have been introduced before the siege of Troy by Dedalus, who, in order to escape the resentment of Minos king of Crete, took refuge in Sicily, from whence he passed into Italy, where he left many monuments of his art. Pausanias and Diodorus Siculus informs us, that some works ascribed to him were to be seen when they wrote, and that these possessed that character of majesty which afterwards distinguished the labours of Etruria.\n\nA character strongly marked forms the chief distinc-\ntion in those productions of Etruria which have descended to us. Their style was indeed harsh and overcharged; a fault also committed by Michael Angelo the celebrated painter of modern Etruria; for it is not to be supposed that a people of such rude manners as the Etrurians could communicate to their works that vivacity and beauty which the elegance of Grecian manners inspired. On the other hand, there are many of the Tuscan statues which bear so close a resemblance to those of Greece, that antiquarians have thought it probable that they were conveyed from that country, or Magna Graecia, into Etruria, about the time of the Roman conquest, when Italy was adorned with the spoils of Greece.\n\nAmong the monuments of Etrurian art two different styles have been observed. In the first the lines are straight, the attitude stiff, and no idea of beauty appears in the formation of the head. The contour is not well rounded, and the figure is too slender. The head is oval, the chin piked, the eyes flat, and looking aquiline.\n\nThere are the defects of an art in a state of infancy, which an accomplished master could never fall into, and are equally conspicuous in Gothic statues as in the productions of the ancient natives of Florence. They resemble the style of the Egyptians so much, that one is almost induced to suppose that there had once been a communication between these two nations; but others think that this style was introduced by Dedalus.\n\nWinkelmann supposes that the second epoch of this art commenced in Etruria, about the time at which it had reached its greatest perfection in Greece, in the age of Phidias; but this conjecture is not supported by any proofs. To describe the second style of sculpture among the Etrurians, is almost the same as to describe the style of Michael Angelo and his numerous imitators. The joints are strongly marked, the muscles raised, the bones distinguishable; but the whole mien harsh. In defining the bone of the leg, and the separation of the muscles of the calf, there is an elevation and strength above life. The statues of the gods are designed with more delicacy. In forming them, the artists were anxious to show that they could exercise their power without that violent diffusion of the muscles which is necessary in the exertions of beings merely human; but in general their attitudes are unnatural, and the actions strained. If a statue, for instance, hold any thing with its fore fingers, the rest are stretched out in a stiff position.\n\nAccording to ancient history, the Greeks did not emerge from the savage state till a long time after the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Indians, had arrived at a considerable degree of civilization. The original rude inhabitants of Greece were civilized by colonies which arrived among them, at different times, from Egypt and Phenicia. These brought along with them the religion, the letters, and the arts of their parent countries; and if sculpture had its origin from the worship of idols, there is reason to believe that it was one of the arts which were thus imported; for that the gods of Greece were of Egyptian and Phenician extraction is a fact incontrovertible; (see Mysteries, Mythology, Philology, Sect. VII. Philosophy, No. 19, and Titan). The original statues of the gods, however, were very rude. The earliest objects of idolatrous worship\nworship have everywhere been the heavenly bodies; and the symbols consecrated to them were generally pillars of a conical or pyramidal figure. It was not till hero-worship was engrained on the planetary, that the sculptor thought of giving to the sacred statue any part of the human form (see Polytheism, No 19, 23); and it appears to have been about the era of their revolution in idolatry that the art of sculpture was introduced among the Greeks. The first representations of their gods were round stones placed upon cubes or pillars; and these stones they afterwards formed roughly, so as to give them something of the appearance of a head. Agreeable to this description was a Jupiter, which Pausanias saw in Tegeum, in Arcadia. These representations were called Hermes; not that they represented Mercury, but from the word Herma, which signified a rough stone. It is the name which Homer gives to the stones which were used to fix vessels to the shore. Pausanias saw at Phere 30 deities made of unformed blocks or cubical stones. The Lacedemonians represented Castor and Pollux by two parallel poles; and a transverse beam was added, to express their mutual affection.\n\nIf the Greeks derived from foreign nations the rudiments of the arts, it must redound much to their honour, that in a few centuries they carried them to such wonderful perfection as entirely to eclipse the fame of their masters. It is by tracing the progress of sculpture among them that we are to study the history of this art; and we shall see its origin and successive improvements correspond with nature, which always operates slowly and gradually.\n\n**View of Grecian Sculpture.**\n\nThe great superiority of the Greeks in the art of sculpture may be ascribed to a variety of causes. The influence of climate over the human body is so striking, that it must have fixed the attention of every thinking man who has reflected on the subject. The violent heats of the torrid zone, and the excessive cold of the polar regions, are unfavourable to beauty. It is only in the mild climates of the temperate regions that it appears in its most attractive charms. Perhaps no country in the world enjoys a more serene air, less tainted with mists and vapours, or possesses in a higher degree that mild and genial warmth which can unfold and expand the human body into all the symmetry of muscular strength, and all the delicacies of female beauty in greater perfection, than the happy climate of Greece; and never was there any people that had a greater taste for beauty, or were more anxious to improve it. Of the four virtues of Simonides, the second was to have a handsome figure. The love of beauty was so great among the Lacedemonian women, that they kept in their chambers the statues of Nereus, of Narcissus, of Hyacinthus, and of Castor and Pollux; hoping that by often contemplating them they might have beautiful children.\n\nThere was a variety of circumstances in the noble and virtuous freedom of the Grecian manners that rendered these models of beauty peculiarly subservient to the cultivation of the fine arts. There were no tyrannical laws, as among the Egyptians, to check their progress. They had the best opportunities to study them in the public places, where the youth, who needed no other veil than chastity and purity of manners, performed their various exercises quite naked. They had the strongest motives to cultivate sculpture, for a statue was the highest honour which public merit could attain. It was an honour ambitiously sought, and granted only to those who had distinguished themselves in the eyes of their fellow citizens. As the Greeks preferred natural qualities to acquired accomplishments, they decreed the first rewards to those who excelled in agility and strength of body. Statues were often raised to wrestlers. Even the most eminent men of Greece, in their youth, sought renown in gymnastic exercises. Chryippus and Cleantes distinguished themselves in the public games before they were known as philosophers. Plato appeared as a wrestler both at the Isthmian and Pythian games; and Pythagoras carried off the prize at Elis, (see Pythagoras). The passion by which they were inspired was the ambition of having their statues erected in the most sacred place of Greece, to be seen and admired by the whole people. The number of statues erected on different occasions was immense; of course the number of artists must have been great, their emulation ardent, and their progress rapid.\n\nAs most of their statues were decreed for those who vanquished in the public games, the artists had the opportunity of seeing excellent models; for those who surpassed in running, boxing, and wrestling, must in general have been well formed, yet would exhibit different kinds of beauty.\n\nThe high estimation in which sculptors were held was very favourable to their art. Socrates declared the artists the only wise men. An artist could be a legislator, a commander of armies, and might hope to have his statue placed beside those of Militides and Themistocles, or those of the gods themselves. Besides, the honour and success of an artist did not depend on the caprice of pride or of ignorance. The productions of art were estimated and rewarded by the greatest sages in the general assembly of Greece, and the sculptor who had executed his work with ability and taste was confident of obtaining immortality.\n\nIt was the opinion of Winkelmann, that liberty was highly favourable to this art; but, though liberty is absolutely necessary to the advancement of science, it may be doubted whether the fine arts owe their improvement to it. Sculpture flourished most in Greece, when Pericles exercised the power of a king; and in the reign of Alexander, when Greece was conquered. It attained no perfection in Rome till Augustus had enslaved the Romans. It revived in Italy under the patronage of the family of Medici, and in France under the despotic rule of Louis XIV. It is the love of beauty, luxury, wealth, or the patronage of a powerful individual, that promotes the progress of this art.\n\nIt will now be proper to give a particular account of the ideas which the Greeks entertained concerning the idea of standard of beauty in the different parts of the human body. And with respect to the head, the profile which they chiefly admired is peculiar to dignified beauty. It consists in a line almost straight, or marked by such slight and gentle inflections as are scarcely distinguishable from a straight line. In the figures of women and young persons, the forehead and nose form a line approaching to a perpendicular.\nAncient writers, as well as artists, assure us that the Greeks reckoned a small forehead a mark of beauty, and a high forehead a deformity. From the same idea, the Circassians wore their hair hanging down over their foreheads almost to their eyebrows. To give an oval form to the countenance, it is necessary that the hair should cover the forehead, and thus make a curve about the temples; otherwise the face, which terminates in an oval form in the inferior part, will be angular in the higher part, and the proportion will be destroyed. This rounding of the forehead may be seen in all handsome persons, in all the heads of ideal beauty in ancient statues, and especially in those of youth. It has been overlooked, however, by modern statuaries. Bernini, who modelled a statue of Louis XIV. in his youth, turned back the hair from the forehead.\n\nIt is generally agreed that large eyes are beautiful; but their size is of less importance in sculpture than their form, and the manner in which they are enchaired. In ideal beauty, the eyes are always sunk deeper than they are in nature, and consequently the eyebrows have a greater projection. But in large statues, placed at a certain distance, the eyes, which are of the same colour with the rest of the head, would have little effect if they were not sunk. By deepening the cavity of the eye, the statuary increases the light and shade, and thus gives the head more life and expression. The same practice is used in small statues. The eye is a characteristic feature in the heads of the different deities. In the statues of Apollo, Jupiter, and Juno, the eye is large and round. In those of Pallas they are also large; but by lowering the eyelids, the virgin air and expression of modesty are delicately marked. Venus has small eyes, and the lower eyelid being raised a little, gives them a languishing look and enchanting sweetness. It is only necessary to see the Venus de Medicis to be convinced that large eyes are not essential to beauty, especially if we compare her small eyes with those which resemble them in nature. The beauty of the eyebrows consists in the fineness of the hair, and in the sharpness of the bone which covers them; and matters of the art considered the joining of the eyebrows as a deformity, though it is sometimes to be met with in ancient statues.\n\nThe beauty of the mouth is peculiarly necessary to constitute a fine face. The lower lip must be fuller than the upper, in order to give an elegant rounding to the chin. The teeth seldom appear, except in laughing satyrs. In human figures the lips are generally close, and a little opened in the figures of the gods. The lips of Venus are half open.\n\nIn figures of ideal beauty, the Grecian artists never interrupted the rounding of the chin by introducing a dimple; for this they considered not as a mark of beauty, and only to be admitted to distinguish individuals. The dimple indeed appears in some ancient statues, but antiquaries suspect it to be the work of a modern hand. It is suspected also, that the dimple which is sometimes found on the cheeks of ancient statues is a modern innovation.\n\nNo part of the head was executed by the ancients with more care than the ears, though little attention has been given to them by modern artists. This character is so decisive, that if we observe in any statue that the ears are not highly finished, but only roughly marked, we may conclude with certainty that we are examining a modern production. The ancients were very attentive to copy the precise form of the ear in taking likenesses. Thus, where we meet with a head the ears of which have a very large interior opening, we know it to be the head of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe manner in which the ancient artists formed the hair also enables us to distinguish their works from those of the moderns. On hard and coarse stones the hair was short, and appeared as if it had been combed with a wide comb; for that kind of stone was difficult to work, and could not without immense labour be formed into curled and flowing hair. But the figures executed in marble in the most flourishing period of the art have the hair curled and flowing; at least where the head was not intended to be an exact resemblance, for then the artist conformed to his model. In the heads of women, the hair was thrown back, and tied behind in a waving manner, leaving considerable intervals; which gives the agreeable variety of light and shade, and produces the effects of the claro-oscuro. The hair of the Amazons is disposed in this manner. Apollo and Bacchus have their hair falling down their shoulders; and young persons, till they arrived at manhood, wore their hair long. The colour of the hair which was reckoned most beautiful, was fair; and this they gave without distinction to the most beautiful of their gods, Apollo and Bacchus, and likewise to their most illustrious heroes.\n\nAlthough the ravages of time have preserved but few of the hands or feet of ancient statues, it is evident from what remains how anxious the Grecian artists were to give every perfection to these parts. The hands of young persons were moderately plump, with little cavities or dimples at the joints of the fingers. The fingers tapered very gently from the root to the point, like well-proportioned columns, and the joints were scarcely perceptible. The terminating joint was not bent, as it commonly appears in modern statues.\n\nIn the figures of young men the joints of the knees are faintly marked. The knee unites the leg to the foot, thigh without making any remarkable projections or cavities. The most beautiful legs and best-turned knees, according to Winkelmann, are preferred in the Apollo Sauroctonos, in the Villa Borgheze; in the Apollo which has a swan at its feet; and in the Bacchus of Villa Medicis. The same able connoisseur remarks, it is rare to meet with beautiful knees in young persons, or in the elegant representations of art. As the ancients did not cover the feet as we do, they gave to them the most beautiful turning, and studied the form of them with the most scrupulous attention.\n\nThe breasts of men were large and elevated. The breasts of women did not possess much amplitude. The lower figures of the deities have always the breasts of a virgin, body, the beauty of which the ancients made to consist in a gentle elevation. So anxious were the women to resemble this standard, that they used several arts to restrain the growth of their breasts. The breasts of the nymphs and goddesses were never represented swelling, because that is peculiar to those women who suckle. The paps of Venus contract and end in a point, this being considered as an essential characteristic of perfect beauty. Some of the moderns have transgressed these rules, and have fallen into great improprieties.\nThe lower part of the body in the statues of men was formed like that of the living body after a profound sleep and good digestion. The navel was considerably sunk, especially in female statues.\n\nAs beauty never appears in equal perfection in every part of the same individual, perfect or ideal beauty can only be produced by selecting the most beautiful parts from different models; but this must be done with such judgement and care, that these detached beauties when united may form the most exact symmetry. Yet the ancients sometimes confined themselves to one individual, even in the most flourishing age. Theodorus, whom Socrates and his disciples visited, served as a model to the artists of his time. Phryne also appears to have been a model to the painters and sculptors. But Socrates, in his conversation with Parrhasius, says, that when a perfect beauty was to be produced, the artists joined together the most striking beauties which could be collected from the finest figures. We know that Zeuxis, when he was going to paint Helen, united in one picture all the beauties of the most handsome women of Crotona.\n\nThe Grecian sculptors, who represented with such success the most perfect beauty of the human form, were not regardless of the drapery of their statues. They clothed their figures in the most proper stuff, which they wrought into that shape which was best calculated to give effect to their design.\n\nThe vestments of women in Greece generally consisted of linen cloth, or some other light stuff, and in latter times of silk and sometimes of woollen cloth. They had also garments embroidered with gold. In the works of sculpture, as well as in those of painting, one may distinguish the linen by its transparency and small united folds. The other light stuffs which were worn by the women (A) were generally of cotton produced in the isle of Cos; and the art of statuary was able to distinguish from the linen vestments. The cotton cloth was sometimes striped, and sometimes embellished with a profusion of flowers. Silk was also employed; but whether it was known in Greece before the time of the Roman emperors cannot easily be determined. In paintings, it is indistinguishable by changing its colour in different lights to red, violet, and sky-blue. There were two sorts of purple; that which the Greeks called the colour of the sea, and Tyrian purple, which resembled lac. Woollen garments are easily known by the amplitude of their folds. Besides these, cloth of gold sometimes composed their drapery; but it was not like the modern fabric, consisting of a thread of gold or of silver spun with a thread of silk; it was composed of gold or silver alone, without any mixture.\n\nThe vestments of the Greeks, which deserve particular attention, are the tunic, the robe, and the mantle.\n\nThe tunic was that part of the dress which was next to the body. It may be seen in sleeping figures, or in those in dishabille; as in the Flora Farnese, and in the statues of the Amazons in the Capitol. The youngest of the daughters of Niobe, who throws herself at her mother's side, is clothed only with a tunic. It was of linen, or some other light stuff, without sleeves, fixed to the shoulders by a button, so as to cover the whole breast. None but the tunics of the goddesses Ceres and comedians have long straight sleeves.\n\nThe robes of women commonly consisted of two long pieces of woollen cloth, without any particular form, attached to the shoulders by a great many buttons, and sometimes by a clasp. They had straight sleeves which came down to the wrists. The young girls, as well as the women, fastened their robe to their side by a cinchure, in the same way as the high-priest of the Jews fastened his, as it is still done in many parts of Greece. The cinchure formed on the side a knot of ribbons sometimes resembling a role in shape, which has been particularly remarked in the two beautiful daughters of Niobe. In the younger of these the cinchure is seen passing over the shoulders and the back. Venus has two cinchures, the one passing over the shoulder, and the other surrounding the waist. The latter is called cinctus by the poets.\n\nThe mantle was called peplos by the Greeks, which signifies properly the mantle of Pallas. The name was afterwards applied to the mantles of the other gods, as well as to those of men. This part of the dress was not square, as some have imagined, but of a roundish form. The ancients indeed speak in general of square mantles, but they received this shape from four tassels which were affixed to them; two of these were visible, and two were concealed under the mantle. The mantle was brought under the right arm, and over the left shoulder; sometimes it was attached to the shoulder by two buttons, as may be seen in the beautiful statue of Leucothoe at Villa Albani.\n\nThe colour of vestments peculiar to certain statues is too curious to be omitted. To begin with the figures of the gods.—The drapery of Jupiter was red, that of Neptune's tune is supposed by Winkelmann to have been sea-green. The same colour also belonged to the Nereids and Nymphs. The mantle of Apollo was blue or violet. Bacchus was draped in white. Martianus Capella assigns green to Cybele. Juno's vestments were sky-blue, but sometimes had a white veil. Pallas was robed in a flame-coloured mantle. In a painting of Herculanum, Venus is in flowing drapery of a golden yellow. Kings were arrayed in purple; priests in white; and conquerors sometimes in sea-green.\n\nWith respect to the head, women generally wore no covering but their hair; when they wished to cover their head, they used the corner of their mantle. Sometimes we meet with veils of a fine transparent texture. Old women wore a kind of bonnet upon their head, an example of which may be seen in a statue in the Capitol, called the Praetexta; but Winkelmann thinks it is a statue of Hecuba.\n\nThe covering of the feet consisted of shoes or sandals. The sandals were generally an inch thick, and composed of more than one sole of cork. Those of Pallas in Villa Albani has two soles, and other statues had no less than five.\n\n(A) Men sometimes wore cotton, but all who did so were reckoned effeminate.\nWinkelmann has assigned four different styles to this art. The ancient style, which continued until the time of Phidias; the grand style, formed by that celebrated statuary; the beautiful, introduced by Praxiteles, Apelles, and Lysippus; and the imitative style, practised by those artists who copied the works of the ancient masters.\n\nThe most authentic monuments of the ancient style are medals, containing an inscription, which leads us back to very distant times. The writing is from right to left in the Hebrew manner; a usage which was abandoned before the time of Herodotus. The statue of Agamemnon at Elis, which was made by Ornaas, has an inscription from right to left. This artist flourished 52 years before Phidias; it is in the intervening period therefore between these two artists, that we are to look for the cessation of this practice. The statues formed in the ancient style were neither distinguished by beauty of shape nor by proportion, but bore a close resemblance to those of the Egyptians and Etruscans (B); the eyes were long and flat; the flection of the mouth not horizontal; the chin was pointed; the curls of the hair were ranged in little rings, and resembled grains inclosed in a heap of raisins. What was still worse, it was impossible by inspecting the head to distinguish the sex.\n\nThe characters of this ancient style were these: The designing was energetic, but harsh; it was animated, but without gracefulness; and the violence of the expression deprived the whole figure of beauty.\n\nThe grand style was brought to perfection by Phidias, Polycleitus, Scopas, Alcamenes, Myron, and other illustrious artists. It is probable, from some pages of ancient writers, that in this style were preserved some characters of the ancient manner, such as the straight lines, the squares and angles. The ancient masters, such as Polycleitus, being the legislators of proportions, says Winkelmann, and of consequence thinking they had a right to distribute the measures and dimensions of the parts of the human body, have undoubtedly sacrificed some degree of the form of beauty to a grandeur which is harsh, in comparison of the flowing contours and graceful forms of their successors.—The most considerable monuments of the grand style are the statues of Niobe and her daughters, and a figure of Pallas, to be seen in Villa Albani; which, however, must not be confounded with the statue which is modelled according to the first style, and is also found in the same place. The head possesses all the characters of dignified beauty, at the same time exhibiting the rigidity of the ancient style. The face is defective in gracefulness; yet it is evident how easy it would have been to give the features more roundness and grace. The figures of Niobe and her daughters have not, in the opinion of Winkelmann, that austerity of appearance which marks the age of the statue of Pallas. They are characterized by grandeur and simplicity: so simple are the forms, that they do not appear to be the tedious productions of art, but to have been created by an instantaneous effort of nature.\n\nVol. XIX. Part I.\n\nThe third style was the graceful or beautiful. Lysippus was perhaps the artist who introduced this style. The grace being more convenient than his predecessors with the sweet, the pure, the flowing, and the beautiful lines of nature, he avoided the square forms which the masters of the second style had too much employed. He was of opinion that the use of the art was rather to please than to astonish, and that the aim of the artist should be to raise admiration by giving delight. The artists who cultivated this style did not, however, neglect to study the sublime works of their predecessors. They knew that grace is consistent with the most dignified beauty, and that it possesses charms which must ever please; they knew also that these charms are enhanced by dignity. Grace is infused into all the movements and attitudes of their statues, and it appears in the delicate turns of the hair, and even in the adjusting of the drapery. Every sort of grace was well known to the ancients; and great as the ravages of time have been amongst the works of art, specimens are still preserved, in which can be distinguished dignified beauty, attractive beauty, and a beauty peculiar to infants. A specimen of dignified beauty may be seen in the statue of one of the mules in the palace of Barberini at Rome; and in the garden of the pope, on the Quirinal, is a statue of another mule, which affords a fine instance of attractive beauty. Winkelmann says that the most excellent model of infant beauty which antiquity has transmitted to us is a satyr of a year old, which is preserved, though a little mutilated, in Villa Albani.\n\nThe great reputation of Praxiteles and Apelles raised an ardent emulation in their successors, who despairing to surpass such illustrious matters, were satisfied with imitating their works. But it is well known that a mere imitator is always inferior to the master whom he attempts to copy. When no original genius appears, the art must therefore decline.\n\nClay was the first material which was employed in Materials statuary. An instance of this may be seen in a figure of Grecian of Alcamenes in bas-relief in Villa Albani. The ancients used their fingers, and especially their nails, to render certain parts more delicate and lively: hence arose the phrase ad ungueum factus homo, \"an accomplished man.\" It was the opinion of Count Caylus that plaster, the ancients did not use models in forming their statues. But to disprove this, it is only necessary to mention an engraving on a stone in the cabinet of Stofch, which represents Prometheus engraving the figure of a man, with a plummet in his hand to measure the proportions of his model. The ancients as well as the moderns made works in plaster; but no specimens remain except some figures in bas-relief, of which the most beautiful were found at Baia.\n\nThe works made of ivory and silver were generally of a small size. Sometimes, however, statues of a prodigious size were formed of gold and ivory. The colossal Minerva of Phidias, which was composed of these materials, was 26 cubits high. It is indeed scarcely possible\n\n(B) This is a proof additional to those that will be found in the articles to which we have referred, that the Greeks received the rudiments of the art of sculpture from the nations to which they were confessedly indebted for the elements of science.\npossible to believe that statues of such a size could entirely consist of gold and ivory. The quantity of ivory necessary to a colossal statue is beyond conception. M. de Paw calculates that the statue of Jupiter Olympus, which was 54 feet high, would consume the teeth of 300 elephants.\n\nThe Greeks generally hewed their marble statues out of one block, though they after worked the heads separately, and sometimes the arms. The heads of the famous group of Niobe and her daughters have been adapted to their bodies after being separately finished. It is proved by a large figure representing a river, which is preserved in Villa Albani, that the ancients first hewed their statues roughly before they attempted to finish any part. When the statue had received its perfect figure, they next proceeded to polish it with pumice-stone, and again carefully retouched every part with the chisel.\n\nThe ancients, when they employed porphyry, usually made the head and extremities of marble. It is true, that at Venice there are four figures entirely composed of porphyry; but these are the productions of the Greeks of the middle age. They also made statues of basaltes and alabaster.\n\nWithout expression, gesture, and attitude, no figure can be beautiful, because in these the graces always reside. It was for this reason that the graces are always represented as the companions of Venus.\n\nThe expression of tranquillity was frequent in Grecian statues, because, according to Plato, that was considered as the middle state of the soul between pleasure and pain. Experience, too, shows that in general the most beautiful persons are endowed with the sweetest and most engaging manner. Without a sedate tranquillity dignified beauty could not exist. It is in this tranquillity, therefore, that we must look for the complete display of genius.\n\nThe most elevated species of tranquillity and repose was studied in the figures of the gods. The father of the gods, and even inferior divinities, are represented without emotion or resentment. It is thus that Homer paints Jupiter shaking Olympus by the motion of his hair and his eyebrows.\n\nShakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,\nThe stamp of fate and sanction of the god.\n\nJupiter is not always exhibited in this tranquil state. In a bas-relief belonging to the marquis Rondini he appears seated on an arm-chair with a melancholy aspect. The Apollo of the Vatican represents the god in a fit of rage against the serpent Python, which he kills at a blow. The artist, adopting the opinion of the poets, has made the nose the seat of anger, and the lips the seat of disdain.\n\nTo express the action of a hero, the Grecian sculptors delineated the countenance of a noble virtuous character expressing his groans, and allowing no expression of pain to appear. In describing the actions of a hero the poet has much more liberty than the artist. The poet can paint them such as they were before men were taught to subdue their passions by the restraints of law, or the refined customs of social life. But the artist, obliged to select the most beautiful forms, is reduced to the necessity of giving such an expression of the passions as may not shock our feelings and disgust us with his production. The truth of these remarks will be acknowledged by those who have seen two of the most beautiful monuments of antiquity; one of which represents the fear of death, the other the most violent pains and sufferings. The daughters of Niobe, against whom Diana has discharged her fatal arrows, are exhibited in that state of stupefaction which we imagine must take place when the certain prospect of death deprives the soul of all sensibility. The fable presents us an image of that stupor which Eleuthyus describes as seizing the daughters of Niobe when they were transformed into a rock. The other monument referred to is the image of Laocoön, which exhibits the most agonizing pain that can affect the muscles, the nerves, and the veins. The sufferings of the body and the elevation of the soul are expressed in every member with equal energy, and form the most sublime contrast imaginable. Laocoön appears to suffer with such fortitude, that, whilst his lamentable situation pierces the heart, the whole figure fills us with an ambition of imitating his constancy and magnanimity in the pains and sufferings that may fall to our lot.\n\nPhiloctetes is introduced by the poets shedding tears, uttering complaints, and rending the air with his groans and cries; but the artist exhibits him silent and bearing his pains with dignity. The Ajax of the celebrated painter Timomachus is not drawn in the act of destroying the sheep which he took for the Grecian chiefs, but in the moments of reflection which succeeded that frenzy. So far did the Greeks carry their love of calmness and slow movements, that they thought a quick step always announced rudeness of manners. Demosthenes reproaches Nicobulus for this very thing; and from the words he makes use of, it appears, that to speak with insolence and to walk hastily were reckoned synonymous.\n\nIn the figures of women, the artists have conformed to the principle observed in all the ancient tragedies, recommended by Aristotle, never to make women show too much intrepidity or excessive cruelty. Conformable to this maxim, Clytemnestra is represented at a little distance from the fatal spot, watching the murderer, but without taking any part with him. In a painting of Timomachus representing Medea and her children, when Medea lifts up the dagger they smile in her face, and her fury is immediately melted into compassion for the innocent victims. In another representation of the same subject, Medea appears hesitating and indecisive. Guided by the same maxims, the artists of most refined taste were careful to avoid all deformity, choosing rather to recede from truth than from their accustomed respect for beauty, as may be seen in several figures of Hecuba. Sometimes, however, she appears in the decrepitude of age, her face furrowed with wrinkles, and her breasts hanging down.\n\nIllustrious men, and those invested with the offices of dignity, are represented with a noble assurance and firm aspect. The statues of the Roman emperors resemble those of heroes, and are far removed from every species of flattery, in the gesture, in the attitude, and action. They never appear with haughty looks, or with the splendor of royalty; no figure is ever seen presenting any thing to them with bended knee, except captives; and none addresses them with an inclination of the head.\nIn modern works too little attention has been paid to the ancient costume. Winkelmann mentions a bas-relief which was lately executed at Rome for the fountain of Trevi, representing an architect in the act of presenting the plan of an aqueduct to Marcus Agrippa. The modern sculptor, not content with giving a long beard to that illustrious Roman, contrary to all the ancient marble statues as well as medals which remain, exhibits the architect on his knees.\n\nIn general, it was an established principle to banish all violent passions from public monuments. This will serve as a decisive mark to distinguish the true antique from spurious works. A medal has been found exhibiting two Allyrians, a man and woman tearing their hair, with this inscription, Assyria, et. Paestina, in. Potest. P. R. Redac. s.c. The forgery of this medal is manifest from the word Palagia, which is not to be found in any ancient Roman medal with a Latin inscription. Besides, the violent action of tearing the hair does not suit any symbolical figure. This extravagant style, which was called by the ancients parenthys, has been imitated by most of the modern artists. Their figures resemble comedians on the ancient theatres, who, in order to suit the distant spectators, put on painted masks, employed exaggerated gestures, and far overleaped the bounds of nature. This style has been reduced into a theory in a treatise on the passions composed by Le Brun. The designs which accompany that work exhibit the passions in the very highest degree, approaching even to frenzy; but these are calculated to vitiate the taste, especially of the young; for the ardour of youth prompts them rather to seize the extremity than the middle; and it will be difficult for that artist who has formed his taste from such empassioned models ever to acquire that noble simplicity and sedate grandeur which distinguished the works of ancient taste.\n\nProportion is the basis of beauty, and there can be no beauty without it; on the contrary, proportion may exist where there is little beauty. Experience every day teaches us that knowledge is distinct from taste; and proportion, therefore, which is founded on knowledge, may be strictly observed in any figure, and yet the figure have no pretensions to beauty. The ancients considering ideal beauty as the most perfect, have frequently employed it in preference to the beauty of nature.\n\nThe body consists of three parts as well as the members. The three parts of the body are the trunk, the thighs, and the legs. The inferior parts of the body are the thighs, the legs, and the feet. The arms also consist of three parts. These three parts must bear a certain proportion to the whole as well as to one another. In a well-formed man the head and body must be proportioned to the thighs, the legs, and the feet, in the same manner as the thighs are proportioned to the legs and the feet, or the arms to the hands. The face also consists of three parts, that is, three times the length of the nose; but the head is not four times the length of the nose, as some writers have asserted. From the place where the hair begins to the crown of the head are only three-fourths of the length of the nose, or that part is to the nose as 9 to 12.\n\nIt is probable that the Grecian, as well as Egyptian artists, have determined the great and small proportions by fixed rules; that they have established a positive measure for the dimensions of length, breadth, and circumference. This supposition alone can enable us to account for the great conformity which we meet with in ancient statues. Winkelmann thinks that the foot was the measure which the ancients used in all their great dimensions, and that it was by the length of it that they regulated the measure of their figures, by giving them five times that length. This in fact is the length which Vitruvius assigns, Pes vero altitudinis corporis sextae, lib. iii. cap. 1. That celebrated antiquary thinks the foot is a more determinate measure than the head or the face, the parts from which modern painters and sculptors too often take their proportions. This proportion of the foot to the body, which has appeared strange and incomprehensible to the learned Huetius, and has been entirely rejected by Perrault, is however founded upon experience. After measuring with great care a vast number of figures, Winkelmann found this proportion observed not only in Egyptian statues, but also in those of Greece. This fact may be determined by an inspection of those statues the feet of which are perfect. One may be fully convinced of it by examining some divine figures, in which the artists have made some parts beyond their natural dimensions. In the Apollo Belvedere, which is a little more than seven heads high, the foot is three Roman inches longer than the head. The head of the Venus de Medicis is very small, and the height of the statue is seven heads and a half; the foot is three inches and a half longer than the head, or precisely the fifth part of the length of the whole statue.\n\nPractice of Sculpture.\n\nWe have been thus minute in our account of the Grecian sculpture, because it is the opinion of the ablest sculpture critics that modern artists have been more or less eminently deficient as they have studied with the greater or less attention the models left us by that ingenious people; modern artists, Winkelmann goes so far as to contend that the most finished works of the Grecian masters ought to be studied in preference even to the works of nature. This appears to be paradoxical; but the reason assigned by the Abbé for his opinion is, that the fairest lines of beauty are more easily discovered, and make a more striking and powerful impression, by their reunion in these sublime copies, than when they are scattered far and wide in the original. Allowing, therefore, the study of nature the high degree of merit it justly claims, it must nevertheless be granted, that it leads to true beauty by a much more tedious, laborious, and difficult path, than the study of the antique, which presents immediately to the artist's view the object of his researches, and combines in a clear and strong point of light the various rays of beauty that are dispersed through the wide domain of nature.\n\nAs soon as the artist has laid this excellent foundation, acquired an intimate degree of familiarity with the beauties of the Grecian statues, and formed his taste after the admirable models they exhibit, he may then proceed with advantage and assurance to the imitation of nature. The ideas he has already formed of the perfection of nature, by observing her diversified beauties combined and collected in the compositions of the ancient artists,\nSCULPTURE.\n\nArtists will enable him to acquire with facility, and to employ with advantage, the detached and partial ideas of beauty which will be exhibited to his view in a survey of nature in her actual state. When he discovers these partial beauties, he will be capable of combining them with those perfect forms of beauty with which he is already acquainted. In a word, by having always present to his mind the noble models already mentioned, he will be in some measure his own oracle, and will draw rules from his own mind.\n\nThere are, however, two ways of imitating nature. In the one a single object occupies the artist, who endeavours to represent it with precision and truth; in the other, certain lines and features are taken from a variety of objects, and combined and blended into one regular whole. All kinds of copies belong to the first kind of imitation; and productions of this kind must be executed necessarily in the Dutch manner, that is to say, with high finishing, and little or no invention. But the second kind of imitation leads directly to the investigation and discovery of true beauty, of that beauty whose idea is connate with the human mind, and is only to be found there in its highest perfection. This is the kind of imitation in which the Greeks excelled, and in which men of genius excite the young artists to excel after their example, viz., by studying nature as they did.\n\nAfter having studied in the productions of the Grecian masters their choice and expression of select nature, their sublime and graceful contours, their noble draperies, together with that sedate grandeur and admirable simplicity that constitute their chief merit, the curious artists will do well to study the manual and mechanical part of their operations, as this is absolutely necessary to the successful imitation of their excellent manner.\n\nIt is certain that the ancients almost always formed their first models in wax: to this modern artists have substituted clay, or some such composition: they prefer clay before wax in the carnations, on account of the yielding nature of the latter, and its sticking in some measure to every thing it touches. We must not, however, imagine from hence that the method of forming models of wet clay was either unknown or neglected among the Greeks; on the contrary, it was in Greece that models of this kind were invented. Their author was Diotades of Sicyon; and it is well known that Arcesilas, the friend of Lucullus, obtained a higher degree of reputation by his clay models than by all his other productions. Indeed, if clay could be made to preserve its original moisture, it would undoubtedly be the fittest substance for the models of the sculptor; but when it is placed either in the fire or left to dry imperceptibly in the air, its solid parts grow more compact, and the figure losing thus a part of its dimensions, is necessarily reduced to a smaller volume. This diminution would be of no consequence did it equally affect the whole figure, so as to preserve its proportions entire. But this is not the case; for the smaller parts of the figure dry sooner than the larger; and thus losing more of their dimensions in the same space of time than the latter do, the symmetry and proportions of the figure inevitably suffer. This inconvenience does not take place in those models that are made in wax. It is indeed extremely difficult, in the ordinary method of working the wax, to give it that degree of smoothness that is necessary to represent the softness of the carnations or fleathy parts of the body. This inconvenience may, however, be remedied, by forming the model first in clay, then moulding it in plaster, and lastly casting it in wax. And, indeed, clay is seldom used but as a mould in which to cast a figure of plaster, stucco, or wax, to serve henceforth for a model by which the measures and proportions of the statue are to be adjusted. In making waxen models, it is common to put half a pound of colophony to a pound of wax; and some add turpentine, melting the whole with oil of olives.\n\nSo much for the first or preparatory steps in this method of procedure. It remains to consider the manner of working the marble after the model is prepared; and the method here followed by the Greeks seems to have been extremely different from that which is generally observed by modern artists. In the ancient statues we find the most striking proofs of the freedom and boldness that accompanied each stroke of the chisel, and which resulted from the artist's being perfectly sure of the accuracy of his idea, and the precision and steadiness of his hand: the most minute parts of the figure carry these marks of assurance and freedom; no indication of timorousness or diffidence appears; nothing that can induce us to fancy that the artist had occasion to correct any of his strokes. It is difficult to find, even in the second-rate productions of the Grecian artists, any mark of a false stroke or a random touch. This firmness and precision of the Grecian chisel were certainly derived from a more determined and perfect set of rules than those which are observed in modern times.\n\nThe method generally observed by the modern sculptor is as follows: First, out of a great block of marble he saws another of the size required, which is performed with a smooth steel saw, without teeth, casting water and sand thereon from time to time; then he fashions it, by taking off what is superfluous with a steel point and a heavy hammer of soft iron; after this, bringing it near the measure required, he reduces it still nearer with another finer point; he then uses a flat cutting instrument, having notches in its edge; and then a chisel to take off the scratches which the former has left; till, at length, taking rasps of different degrees of fineness, by degrees he brings his work into a condition for polishing.\n\nAfter this, having studied his model with all possible attention, he draws upon this model horizontal and perpendicular lines which intersect each other at right angles. He afterwards copies these lines upon his marble, as the painter makes use of such transversal lines to copy a picture, or to reduce it to a smaller size. These transversal lines or squares, drawn in an equal number upon the marble and upon the model, in a manner proportioned to their respective dimensions, exhibit accurate measures of the surfaces upon which the artist is to work; but cannot determine, with equal precision, the depths that are proportioned to these surfaces.—The sculptor, indeed, may determine these depths by observing the relation they bear to his model; but as his eye is the only guide he has to follow in this estimate, he is always more or less exposed to error, or at least to doubt. He is never sure that the cavities made\nby his chisel are exact; a degree of uncertainty accompanies each stroke; nor can he be assured that it has carried away neither too much nor too little of his marble. It is equally difficult to determine, by such lines as have already been mentioned, the external and internal contours of the figure, or to transfer them from the model to the marble. By the internal contour is understood that which is described by the parts which approach towards the centre, and which are not marked in a striking manner.\n\nIt is farther to be noticed, that in a complicated and laborious work, which an artist cannot execute without assistance, he is often obliged to make use of foreign hands, that have not the talents or dexterity that are necessary to finish his plan. A single stroke of the chisel that goes too deep is a defect not to be repaired; and such a stroke may easily happen, where the depths are so imperfectly determined. Defects of this kind are inevitable, if the sculptor, in chipping his marble, begins by forming the depths that are requisite in the figure he designs to represent. Nothing is more liable to error than this manner of proceeding. The cautious artist ought, on the contrary, to form these depths gradually, by little and little, with the utmost circumspection and care; and the determining of them with precision ought to be considered as the last part of his work, and as the finishing touches of his chisel.\n\nThe various inconveniences attending this method determined several eminent artists to look out for one that would be liable to less uncertainty, and productive of fewer errors. The French academy of painting at Rome hit on a method of copying the ancient statues, which some sculptors have employed with success, even in the figures which they finished after models in clay or wax. This method is as follows. The statue that is to be copied is inclosed in a frame that fits it exactly. The upper part of this frame is divided into a certain number of equal parts, and to each of these parts a thread is fixed with a piece of lead at the end of it. These threads, which hang freely, show what parts of the statue are most removed from the centre with much more perspicuity and precision than the lines which are drawn on its surface, and which pass equally over the higher and hollow parts of the block: they also give the artist a tolerable rule to measure the more striking variations of height and depth, and thus render him more bold and determined in the execution of his plan.\n\nBut even this method is not without its defects: for as it is impossible, by the means of a straight line, to determine with precision the procedure of a curve, the artist has, in this method, no certain rule to guide him in his contours; and as often as the line which he is to describe deviates from the direction of the plumb line, which is his main guide, he must necessarily feel himself at a loss, and be obliged to have recourse to conjecture.\n\nIt is also evident, that this method affords no certain rule to determine exactly the proportion which the various parts of the figure ought to bear to each other, considered in their mutual relation and connections. The artist, indeed, endeavours to supply this defect by intersecting the plumb-lines by horizontal ones. This recourse has, nevertheless, its inconveniences, since the squares formed by transversal lines, that are at a distance from the figure (though they be exactly equal), yet represent the parts of the figure as greater or smaller, according as they are more or less removed from our position or point of view. But notwithstanding these inconveniences, the method now under consideration is certainly the best that has hitherto been employed: it is more practicable and sure than any other we know, though it appears, from the remarks we have now been making, that it does not exhibit a sure and universal criterion to a sculptor who executes after a model.\n\nTo polish the statue, or make the parts of it smooth and fleck, pumice-stone and flint are used; then tripoli; and when a still greater lustre is required, burnt straw is employed. For the Casting of Statues, see Foundry, and Plaster of Paris.\n\nSCUM properly denotes the impurities which a liquor, by boiling, casts up to the surface. The term scum is also used for what is more properly called the scoria of metals.\n\nSCUPPERS, in a ship, are certain channels cut through the waterways and sides of a ship, at proper distances, and lined with plated lead, in order to carry the water off from the deck into the sea. The scuppers of the lower deck of a ship of war are usually furnished with a leathern pipe, called the scupper-hose, which hangs downward from the mouth or opening of the scupper. The intent of this is to prevent the water from entering when the ship inclines under a weight of sail.\n\nSCURVY, in Medicine, see that article, No. 351, where we have given an account of the symptoms, causes, and modes of prevention and cure, according to some of the most eminent writers in medicine. We have here only to add, that, in the opinion of Dr Beddoes, the mineral acids, especially the nitric and vitriolic, may be employed in the prevention or cure of this dreadful disease with as much success as the vegetable acids.—But of all the substances that can at once be cheaply procured and long preserved, he thinks the concrete acid of tartar by far the most promising. It is very grateful, and comes near to the citric acid. In tropical countries the scurvy is seldom known.\n\nSCURVY-Grafs.

For the letter, a skin of very thin parchment was wrapped round the roller, and thereon was the matter written; which done, it was taken off, and sent away to the party, who, upon putting it in the same manner upon his roller, found the lines and words in the very same disposition as when they were first written. This expedient they set a very high value on; though, in truth, artifices and tricks enough: the moderns have improved vastly on this method of writing.

See BOTANY Index.\n\nSCYTHE, in Husbandry, a well known instrument which has been long employed for cutting grass for hay. The same instrument with certain modifications in its construction has been used in reaping grain, in place of the sickle the use of which is far more common, and in Scotland at least prevails almost universally, although it must be admitted that the method of reaping by the scythe, where it is practicable, is attended with less labour, is more expeditious, and therefore more economical. But against the use of the scythe, as a reaping instrument, many objections have been raised. Some of these are probably founded in prejudice, while others, considering the slow progress which has been made in introducing this instrument as a substitute for the sickle, rest on a more solid foundation.\n\nIt is said that this instrument shakes the ear, so that many of the grains are lost; that it lets the corn fall after it is cut, in a scattered confused manner, in consequence of which either a great deal of it is lost, or much time is wasted in gathering it together. It is also affirmed that it can only be made use of in very even land, and which is free from stones; that it does not leave length enough of stubble on the ground, on which to lay the corn when it is cut; that it mixes noxious weeds with the corn, the seeds of which are sown the ensuing year; and finally, that the use of the scythe is prejudicial to the health of the reaper.\n\nIt appears, however, that these objections have either no weight, or they are made by those who are unacquainted with the scythes peculiarly adapted to this purpose, and with the manner in which they ought to be used. With a good scythe properly managed, the corn when cut, remains at first upright, afterwards falling gently on the rake fixed to the scythe, without any shaking or jolting, or at least with less than what is occasioned by the sickle. The loss of grain chiefly arises from the corn being too dry, and therefore it ought to be reaped on proper days, and suitable times of the day, which is more easily accomplished by the scythe than the sickle, because the one requires less time than the other. The stalks, held together by the rake, may be laid on the ground, or against the corn not yet cut down, in a state to regular and connected, that those by whom the sheaves are collected and bound have themselves alone to blame, should anything be left behind. It is sufficiently even when lands are ploughed and harrowed.\nScythe-rowed in a proper manner; and the only necessary precaution in flinty ground, is to keep the scythe a little higher, that it may not strike against the stones. If the stubble be short, the straw cut off will of course be the longer, and of consequence more valuable; and long stubble only inconveniences the cattle afterwards sent to feed upon it.\n\nThese and similar considerations, prevailed with the patriotic society of Milan, to send to these places where scythes are used for reaping; and having procured a model from Silea, they ordered one of a proper size to be made. It was first tried on corn, and afterwards on millet; and notwithstanding the first was far from being made with accuracy, and although such an instrument had never before been made use of by the reaper, nearly half the usual time was found to be saved, and the wonted fatigue and labour were much diminished. The corn was cut without receiving any injurious shock, falling in an even and regular state, by which means it was afterwards bound up with ease in compact sheaves.\n\nThese instruments are so simple in their construction, that a figure of one of them renders a description almost unnecessary. Fig. 1. represents the Silean scythe tried by the society, the difference between which and the Austrian one we shall mention in our description. The Silean scythe differs little from that commonly employed in mowing grass, except that the blade is rather smaller; to it four teeth of wood are added, parallel to the blade, fixed and secured in a proper manner, and designed to keep the corn together after it is cut; so that instead of its falling in a confused state, the reaper can lay it down in a regular and compact manner. The Austrian scythe is similar to the former, but the blade is larger; of course the wooden teeth, being five in number, are longer; the handle is also flatter, and rather crooked.\n\nIn the first, the handle ab (see fig. 1.) is four feet three inches in length; the blade bc is about two feet; the piece of wood in which the teeth are fixed, one foot ten inches and a half. In the second, the handle is four feet one inch; the blade, two feet eight inches; the piece in which the teeth are fixed, 1 1/2 inches.\n\nThe difference in the construction of these two scythes renders it necessary to use them in a different manner, which will be better acquired in practice than by precept. Such as are accustomed to the use of the common scythe will soon find out the most advantageous manner of using these new kinds of scythes, and of laying down the corn properly after it is cut.\n\nIt is necessary to observe, that, in mowing grass, the feet are held in a position nearly parallel to each other, whereas in reaping corn they should be kept on a line, the one behind the other, bringing the right foot forward, and drawing the left towards it. The reason is, that when grass is mowed it is left to fall where it is cut; but when corn is cut down, it is to be laid in a proper manner against that which is not yet cut, and which is at the reaper's left hand. Were the feet kept parallel to each other, the reaper would be under the necessity of extending and turning his body in a very inconvenient manner.\n\nThese observations having been published, the society made farther experiments on the subject, by which they discovered, that when the stalks of corn are bent down by reason of extremely wet weather, the wooden teeth of the scythes are apt to lay hold of some ears, to the Scythe, stalks of which the iron does not extend; and therefore these not being cut below, are pulled so that the grain is scattered. This chiefly happens from the reapers not being accustomed to that kind of scythe, and therefore not knowing how to adapt it to particular existing circumstances.\n\nIt occurred to an ingenious blacksmith, that, in order to remedy this inconvenience, a collector made of cloth should be added to the common scythe, as may be seen at fig. 2., where abc is a common scythe, cdml of one Fig. 2. is the gatherer, which at cde is composed of a thin plate of iron, having a hollow at its extremity for receiving the point of the blade. At ed are holes for sewing in the cloth, which is coarse, light, and of low price; it is also fixed to two thick iron wires, of which the upper one is continued to f, where it terminates in a hole in the handle; the other is fixed to the back of the blade. The manner of fixing this gatherer to the back of the scythe will be better understood by referring to fig. 3., which represents one of the irons which, by Fig. 3., means of the forew, are fastened to the back of the scythe. These proceed from, and make part of the upright irons mn, lo, which serve to keep the gatherer extended.\n\nThis contrivance is both cheap and simple; but an attempt was made to render it more so, by substituting two iron hoops for the gatherer, which are shown in fig. 2. by the dotted lines h g, ki, with a cross piece p, Fig. 2., which connects them. Experience has shown, however, that the gatherer is in general preferable to these hoops, as it does not leave an ear of corn behind.\n\nSCYTHIA, an ancient name for the northern parts of Asia, now known by the name of Tartary; also for some of the north-eastern parts of Europe.\n\nThis vast territory, which extends itself from the Ister or Danube, the boundary of the Celts, that is, from about the 25th to almost the 110th degree of east longitude, was divided into Scythia in Europe and Scythia in Asia, including, however, the two Sarmatias; or, as they are called by the Greeks, Sauromatias; now the Circassian Tartary, which lay between and severed the two Scythias from each other. Sauromatia was also distinguished into European and Asiatic; and was divided from the European Scythia by the river Don or Tanaïs, which falls into the Palus Mæotis; and from the Asiatic by the Rha, now Volga, which empties itself into the Caspian sea.\n\n1. The Asiatic Scythia comprehended, in general, great Tartary, and Russia in Asia; and, in particular, the Scythia beyond or without Imaus, contained the regions of Bogdai or Otiacei, and Tangutai. That within, or on this side Imaus, had Turkistan and Mongal, the Ubeck or Zagatai, Kalmuc and Naganai Tartars; besides Siberia, the land of the Samoiedes, and Nova Zembla. These three last not being so soon inhabited as the former, as may be reasonably supposed, were wholly unknown to the ancients; and the former were peopled by the Bactrians, Sogdians, Gandari, Sacks, and Maffageites. As for Sarmatia, it contained Albania, Iberia, and Colchis; which makes now the Circassian Tartary, and the province of Georgia.\n\n2. Scythia in Europe reached (towards the south-west) to the Po and the Alps, by which it was divided from Celto-Gallia. It was bounded on the south by the\nthe Ister or Danube and the Euxine sea. Its northern limits have been supposed to stretch to the spring-heads of the Boristhenes or Nieper, and the Rha or Volga, and so to that of the Tanais.—The ancients divided this country into Scythia Arimafæa, which lay eastward, joining to Scythia in Asia; and Sarmatia Europeana on the west. In Scythia, properly so called, were the Arimafæi on the north; the Getæ or Dacians along the Danube, on the south; and the Neuri between these two. So that it contained the European Russia or Mucovy, and the Lesser Crimean Tartary eastward; and, on the west, Lithuania, Poland, part of Hungary, Transylvania, Walachia, Bulgaria, and Moldavia. Sarmatia is supposed to have reached northward to that part of Swedenland called Fenningia, now Finland; in which they placed the Oceans, Panoti, and Hippopodes. This part they divided from Northern Germany, now the west part of Sweden and Norway, by the Mare Sarmaticum or Scythicum, which they supposed ran up into the northern ocean, and, dividing Lapland into two parts, formed the western part of Sweden, with Norway, into one island, and Finland into another; supposing this also to be cut off from the continent by the gulf of that name.\n\nAlthough the ancient Scythians were celebrated as a warlike people, yet their history is too uncertain and obscure to enable us to give any detail which would not prove equally tiresome and uninteresting to the reader. Mr Pinkerton, in a dissertation on their origin, endeavours to prove that they were the most ancient of nations; and he affirms for the place of their first habitation the country known by the name of Persia. From Persia, he thinks, they proceeded in numerous hordes westward, surrounded the Euxine, peopled Germany, Italy, Gaul, the countries bordering on the Baltic, with part of Britain and Ireland. That the Scythians were of Asiatic origin cannot, we think, be questioned; and as Persia was peopled at a very early period, it may not improbably have been their parent country: but when our author contends that their empire had subsisted for more than 1500 years before Ninus the founder of the Assyrian monarchy, and that it extended from Egypt to the Ganges, and from the Persian gulf and Indian sea to the Caspian, we cannot help thinking that his prejudices against the Celts, and his desire to do honour to his favourite Goths, have made him advance a paradox inconsistent with the most authentic records of antiquity. His dissertation however is ingenious, and replete with a variety of curious learning.\n\n**SCYTHIAN Lamb**, in *Natural History*. See **Scythian Lamb**.\n\n**SCYTHROPS** or **CHANNEL-BILL**, a genus of birds belonging to the order of Picæ. See **Ornithology**, No. 149.\n\n**SEA**, in a strict sense, signifies a large portion of water almost surrounded by land, as the Baltic and Mediterranean seas; but it is frequently used for that vast body of water which encompasses the whole earth.\n\nWhat proportion the superficiality of the sea bears to that of the land cannot easily be ascertained. Buffon has supposed that the surface of our globe is equally divided between land and water, and has accordingly calculated the superficiality of the sea to be 85,490,560 square miles. But it is now well known that the ocean covers much more than the half of the earth's surface. Buffon believed the existence of a vast southern continent, which Captain Cook has shown to be visionary. It was this circumstance which misled him. According to the most accurate observations hitherto made, the surface of the sea is to the land as three to one; the ocean therefore extends over 128,235,759 square miles, supposing the superficiality of the whole globe to be 170,981,012 square miles. To ascertain the depth of the sea is still more difficult than its superficiality, both on account of the numerous experiments which it would be necessary to make, and the want of proper instruments for that purpose. Beyond a certain depth the sea has hitherto been found unfathomable; and though several methods have been contrived to obviate this difficulty, none of them has completely answered the purpose. We know in general that the depth of the sea increases gradually as we leave the shore; but if this continued beyond a certain distance, the depth in the middle of the ocean would be prodigious. Indeed the numerous islands everywhere scattered in the sea demonstrate the contrary, by showing us that the bottom of the water is unequal like the land, and that so far from uniformly sinking, it sometimes rises into lofty mountains. If the depth of the sea be in proportion to the elevation of the land, as has generally been supposed, its greatest depth will not exceed five or six miles, for there is no mountain five miles perpendicular above the level of the sea. The sea has never been actually founded to a greater depth than a mile and 66 feet; every thing beyond that therefore rests entirely upon conjecture and analogical reasoning, which ought never to be admitted to determine a single point that can be ascertained by experiment, because, when admitted, they have too often led to false conclusions. Along the coasts, where the depth of the sea is in general well known, it has always been found proportioned to the height of the shore: when the coast is high and mountainous, the sea that washes it is deep; when, on the contrary, the coast is low, the water is shallow. Whether this analogy holds at a distance from the shore, experiments alone can determine.\n\nTo calculate the quantity of water contained in the Quantity sea, while its depth is unknown, is impossible. But if of water we suppose with Buffon that its medium depth is the fourth part of a mile, the ocean, if its superficiality contains 120,235,759 square miles, will contain 32,058,939-75 cubic miles of water.\n\nLet us now endeavour to compute the quantity of water which is constantly discharged into the sea. For this purpose let us take a river whose velocity and quantity of water is known, the Po, for instance, which according to Riccioli is 1000 feet (or 100 perches of the Earth, Bologna) broad, 10 feet deep, and runs at the rate of four miles in an hour; consequently that river discharges into the sea 200,000 cubic perches of water in an hour, or 4,800,000 in a day. A cubic mile contains 125,000,000 cubic perches; the Po therefore will take 26 days to discharge a cubic mile of water into the sea. Let us now suppose, what is perhaps not very far from the truth, that the quantity of water which the sea receives from the rivers in any country is proportioned to the extent of that country. The Po from its origin to its mouth traverses a country 380 miles long, and the rivers which fall into it on every side rise from sources about sixty miles distant from it.\nThe Po, therefore, and the rivers which it receives, water a country of 43,600 square miles. Now since the whole superficiality of the dry land is about 42,745,253 square miles, it follows, from our supposition, that the quantity of water discharged by all the rivers in the world, in one day, is 36 cubic miles, and in a year 13,140. If therefore the sea contains 320,589,939 cubic miles of water, it would take all the rivers in the world 24,39 years to discharge an equal quantity.\n\nIt may seem surprising that the sea, since it is continually receiving such an immense supply of water, does not visibly increase, and at last cover the whole earth. But our surprise will cease, if we consider that the rivers themselves are supplied from the sea, and that they do nothing more than carry back those waters which the ocean is continually lavishing on the earth. Dr Halley has demonstrated that the vapors raised from the sea and transported on land are sufficient to maintain all the rivers in the world. The simplicity of this great process is astonishing: the sea not only connects distant countries, and renders it easy to transport the commodities of one nation to another, but its waters rising in the air descend in showers to fertilize the earth and nourish the vegetable kingdom, and collecting into rivers flow onwards, bringing fertility and wealth and commerce along with them, and again return to the sea to repeat the same round.\n\nThe knowledge of this process of nature might, one would think, have convinced philosophers that the proportion between sea and land continued always nearly the same. Philosophers however have formed different theories about this as well as most other subjects, maintaining on the one hand that the sea is continually encroaching on the land, and on the other that the land is constantly gaining on the sea. Both sides have supported their theories by arguments, demonstrations, and incontrovertible facts!\n\nThe height of the mountains, say the philosophers who support the encroachments of the sea, is continually diminishing; exposed to the violence of every storm, the hardest rocks must at last give way and tumble down. The rivers are continually sweeping along with them particles of earth which they deposit in the bottom of the sea. Both the depth of the ocean then and the height of the dry land must be always decreasing; the waters therefore must, unless a part of them were annihilated, spread over a greater extent of surface in proportion as these causes operate. This reasoning, convincing as it is, might be confirmed by a great number of facts: it will be sufficient however to mention one or two. In the reign of Augustus the Isle of Wight made a part of Britain, so that the English eroded over to it at low water with cart loads of tin; yet that island is at present separated from Britain by a channel half a mile wide. The Godwin sands on the eastern shore of England were formerly the fertile estate of Earl Godwin. Nor are the encroachments of the sea confined to Britain. In the bay of Baiae near Naples there are remains of houses and streets still visible below the present level of the sea. The sea therefore is making continued encroachments upon the land; and the time will come, say they, when the waters will again cover the surface of the earth.\n\nSuch are the arguments of those philosophers who maintain the continual encroachments of the sea. Those who maintain the opposite theory, that the land is gradually gaining on the sea, though they pretend not to deny the facts advanced by their opponents, affirm that they are altogether insufficient to establish the hypothesis which they were brought forward to support. They affirm that the rivers carry down particles of earth into that the sea, these, say they, are either accumulated on other shores, or, collecting in the bottom of the ocean, harden the sea into stone, which being possessed of a vegetative power rises by degrees above the surface of the sea and forms rocks, and mountains, and islands. The vegetative nature of stone indeed is sufficient, of itself, to convince us that the quantity of earth must be daily accumulating, and consequently that the surface of the sea is diminishing in extent. Celsius, a Swedish philosopher (for this dispute has been carried on in Sweden with the greatest keenness), has endeavored to build this theory with more solid materials than vegetable stone. In a curious memoir, published in 1743, he affirms that the Baltic and the Atlantic, at least that part of it which washes Norway, is constantly diminishing; and he proves this by the testimony of a great many aged pilots and fishermen, who affirmed that the sea was become much shallower in many places than it had been during their youth: that many rocks formerly covered with water were now several feet above the surface of the sea: that loaded vessels used formerly to ride in many places where pinnaces and barks could now with difficulty swim. He produces instances of ancient sea-port towns now several leagues from the shore, and of anchors and wrecks of vessels found far within the country. He mentions a particular rock which 168 years before was at the bottom of the sea, but was then raised eight feet above its surface. In another place where the water 50 years before had reached to the knee there was then none. Several rocks, too, which during the infancy of some old pilots had been two feet under water, were then three feet above it. From all these observations M. Celsius concludes, that the water of the Baltic decreases in height 4½ lines in a year, 4 inches 5 lines in 18 years, 4 feet 5 inches in a hundred years, and in a thousand years 45 feet. Conscious, however, that these facts, how conclusive soever as far as relates to the Baltic, can never determine the general question, M. Celsius advances another argument in support of his theory. All that quantity of moisture, says he, which is imbibed by plants is loft to the general mass of water, being converted into earth by the putrefaction of vegetables. This notion had been mentioned by Newton, and was adopted by Van Helmont: if granted, it follows as a consequence that the earth is continually increasing and the water diminishing in a very rapid degree.\n\nSuch are the arguments advanced in support of both theories; for it is needless to mention a notion of Linnaeus that the whole earth was formerly covered with water except a single mountain. When fairly weighed, they amount to nothing more than this, that the sea has encroached upon the land in some places, and retired in others; a conclusion which we are very willing to allow. What was advanced by those philosophers who maintain that the sea is continually encroaching on the land, about the depth of the sea constantly diminishing, must remain a mere assertion till they prove by experiments, either that this is really the case, or that nature has no way of restoring those particles of earth...\nearth which are washed down by the rivers. Nor have they any good reason to affirm that the height of the mountains is decreasing. Can a single uncontrovertible influence be produced of this? Are the Alps or the Apennines, or Taurus, or Caucasus, less lofty now than they were a thousand years ago? We mean not to deny that the rain actually washes down particles of earth from the mountains, nor to affirm that the hardest rocks are able to resist continual storms, nor that many mountains have suffered, and continue to suffer daily, from a thousand accidents. But the effects produced by all these causes are so trifling as to be altogether imperceptible (a). Nature has affluently guarded against such accidents; she has formed the mountains of the most durable materials; and where they are covered with earth, she has bound it together by a thick and firm matting of grass, and thus secured it from the rains; and should accident deprive it of this covering, she takes care immediately to supply the defect. Even should the earth be swept away together with its covering, nature has still such resources left as frequently restore things to their former state. Many kinds of moss, one would be tempted to think, have been created for this very purpose: they take root and flourish almost upon the bare rock, and furnish, as they decay a sufficient bed for several of the hardy Alpine plants. These perish in their turn, and others succeed them. The roots of the plants bind fast the earth as it accumulates, more plants spring up and spread wider, till by degrees the whole surface is covered with a firm coat of grass.\n\nAs the sea covers so great a portion of the globe, we should, no doubt, by exploring its bottom, discover a vast number of interesting particulars. Unfortunately in the greater part of the ocean this hitherto been impossible. Part, however, has been examined; and the discoveries which this examination has produced may enable us to form some idea at least of the whole. The bottom of the sea, as might have been conjectured indeed beforehand, bears a great resemblance to the surface of the dry land, being, like it, full of plains, rocks, caverns and mountains; some of which are abrupt and almost perpendicular, while others rise with a gentle declivity, and sometimes tower above the water and form islands. Neither do the materials differ which compose the bottom of the sea and the basis of the dry land. If we dig to a considerable depth in any part of the earth, we uniformly meet with rock; the same thing holds in the sea. The strata, too, are of the same kind, disposed in the same manner, and form indeed but one whole. The same kind of mineral and bituminous substances are also found interposed with these strata; and it is to them probably that the sea is indebted for its bitter taste. Over these natural and original strata an artificial bed has pretty generally been formed, composed of different materials in different places. It consists frequently of muddy tartarous substances firmly cemented together, sometimes of shells or coral reduced to powder, and near the mouths of rivers it is generally composed of fine sand or gravel. The bottom of the sea resembles the land likewise in another particular: many fresh springs and even rivers rise out of it, which, displacing the salt water, render the lower part of the sea wherever they abound quite fresh. An instance of this kind occurs near Goa on the western coast of India (b), and another in the Mediterranean sea not far from Marseille. These facts occasioned a notion, which later experiments have exploded, that the sea beyond a certain depth was always fresh.\n\nSubstances of a very beautiful appearance are frequently brought up by the sounding line from the bottom of the sea. The plummet is hollowed below, and inside this cavity filled with tallow, to which some of the substances adhere which form the bed of the ocean. These are generally sand, gravel, or mud; but they are sometimes of the brightest scarlet, vermilion, purple, and yellow; and sometimes, though less frequently, they are blue, green, or white. These colours are owing to a kind of jelly which envelopes the substances, and vanishes entirely as soon as this jelly dries. At times, however, they assume the appearance of tartarous crusts, and are then so permanent, that they can be received into white wax melted and poured round them, and perhaps by proper care might be converted into valuable paints.\n\nSea-water is really, as any one may convince himself by pouring it into a glass, as clear and transparent as the river water. The various appearances therefore which it assumes are owing to accidental causes, and not to any change in the water itself. The depth, or the materials which compose the bottom of the sea, occasions it to assume different colours in different places. The Arabian gulf, for instance, is said to be red from the colour of the sands which form its bed. The appearance of the sea is affected too by the winds and the sun, while the clouds that pass over it communicate all their various and fleeting colours. When the sun shines it is green; when the sun gleams through a fog it is yellow; near the north pole it appears black; while in the torrid zone its colour is often brown. Sometimes the sea assumes a luminous appearance. See Light, Vol. XII, page 2.\n\nThe sea contains the greatest quantity of salt in the Saltness of torrid zone, where otherwise from the excessive heat the sea, it would be in danger of putrefaction: as we advance northward this quantity diminishes, till at the pole it nearly vanishes altogether. Under the line Lucas found that the sea contained a seventh part of solid contents, consisting chiefly of sea-salt. At Harwich he found it yielded $\\frac{1}{7}$th of sea-salt. At Carlisle in Sweden it contains $\\frac{1}{6}$th part (b), and on the coast of Greenland a great deal less. This deficiency of salt near the poles probably contributes a good deal towards the prodigious\n\n(a) M. Gensanne pretends that the Pyrenean mountains become an inch lower every ten years. But even according to his own calculation, it would require a million of years to level these mountains with the plain, though they continued to decrease at the same rate; and philosophers tell us that this rate is constantly diminishing!\n\n(b) This gradual diminution of saltness from the equator to the pole is not, however, without particular exceptions. The Mediterranean sea contains $\\frac{1}{7}$th of sea-salt, which is less than the German sea contains.\nous quantities of ice which are met with in these seas; for salt water requires a much greater degree of cold to freeze it than fresh water. It was this circumstance, probably, together with its confluent motion, which induced the ancients to believe that the sea never froze. Even among the moderns it has been a generally received opinion, that sea-ice is originally formed in rivers. Buffon has made the great quantities of ice with which the South sea abounds an argument for the existence of a continent near the Antarctic pole. But it is now well known that great quantities of ice are formed at a distance from land. Sea-ice is of two kinds; field ice, which extends along the shore, and is only two or three feet thick; and mountain ice, which abounds in the middle of the ocean. The size of these mountains is sometimes prodigious. The sea-ice is always fresh, and has been often of great use to navigators. The weight of sea-water is to that of river-water as 73 to 70; that is, a cubic foot of sea-water weighs 73 lb., while the same quantity of river-water weighs only 70 lb.; but this proportion varies in different places. It is worthy of our attention, too, that the water at the surface of the sea contains less salt than near the bottom; the difference indeed is inconsiderable, but still it is something. The Compte de Marigli found the same quantity of water, when taken from the bottom of the Mediterranean, to weigh one ounce three pennyweights 51 grains; whereas from the surface it weighed only one ounce three pennyweights 49 grains. He repeated the experiment frequently with nearly the same result.\n\nThe sea, with respect to temperature, may be divided into two regions: The first begins at the surface of the water, and extends as far as the influence of the sun's rays; the second reaches from thence to the bottom of the sea. In summer the lower region is considerably colder than the upper; but it is probable that during winter the very reverse takes place; at least the Compte de Marigli found it so repeatedly in the Mediterranean. This naturally results from the situation of the water near the bottom of the sea. Uninfluenced by the changes in the atmosphere, it retains always nearly the same degree of temperature; and this is considerably above congelation; for the lower region of the sea, at least in the temperate parts of the world, was never known to freeze. Captain Ellis let down a sea-gage (see GAGE) in latitude 25° 13' north, and longitude 25° 12' west, to take the degrees of temperature and saltness of the sea at different depths. It descended 3346 feet, which is a mile and eleven fathoms. He found the sea fatter and colder in proportion to its depth till the gage had descended 3920 feet, when the mercury in the thermometer came up at 53°; but the water never grew colder, though he let down the gage 2416 feet lower. At the surface the thermometer stood at 84°.\n\nThe sea has three kinds of motion: 1. The first is that undulation which is occasioned by the wind. This motion is entirely confined to the surface; the bottom even during the most violent storms remains perfectly calm. Mr. Boyle has remarked, from the testimony of several divers, that the sea is affected by the winds only to the depth of six feet. It would follow from this, that the height of the waves above the surface does not exceed six feet; and that this holds in the Mediterranean at least, we are informed by the Compte de Marigli, though he also sometimes observed them, during a very violent tempest, rise two feet higher. It is confirmed by Pliny, and several other ancient writers, that oil calms the waves of the sea; and that divers were accustomed to carry some of it for that purpose in their oil-mouths. This account was always considered by the moderns as a fable, and treated with such contempt, that they did not even deign to put it to the test of experiment, till Dr. Franklin accidentally discovered its truth. Happening in 1757 to be in the middle of a large fleet, he observed that the water round one or two vessels was quite calm and smooth, while everywhere else it was very much agitated by the winds. He applied to the captain for an explanation of this phenomenon, who replied, that the cooks, he supposed, had thrown their greasy water out at the scupper-holes, and by that means oiled the sides of the vessels in question. This answer did not satisfy the Doctor at first; but recollecting what Pliny had said on the subject, he resolved at least to make the experiment. He did so accordingly in 1762, and found that oil actually calmed the waves of the sea. He repeated the experiment upon a pond at Clapham: the oil spread itself with great rapidity upon the surface, but did not produce the desired effect, because, having been thrown in upon the side opposite to the wind, it was immediately driven to the edge of the water. But upon throwing in a like quantity upon the other side of the lake, it calmed in an instant several yards of the surface; and gradually spreading, rendered all that part of the lake, to the extent of at least half an acre, as smooth as glass. The curious effect produced by this liquid may be accounted for by the repulsion which exists between oil and water, and between oil and air, which prevents all immediate contact, all rubbing of the one upon the other.\n\n2. The second kind of motion is that continual tendency which the whole water in the sea has towards the west—Cur- poles; and indeed cannot be said to take place at all in the northern hemisphere beyond the tropic. It begins on the west side of America, where it is moderate; hence that part of the ocean has been called Pacific. As the waters advance westward their motion is accelerated; so that, after having traversed the globe, they strike with great violence on the eastern shore of America. Being stopped by that continent, they turn northward, and run with considerable impetuosity in the gulf of Mexico; from thence they proceed along the coast of North America, till they come to the south side of the great bank at Newfoundland, when they turn off, and run down through the Western Isles. This current is called the Gulf Stream. It was first accurately described by Dr. Franklin, who remarked, also, that the water in it having been originally heated in the torrid zone, cools so gradually in its passage northward, that even the latitude might be found in any part of the stream by means of a thermometer. This motion of the sea westward has never been explained; it seems to have some connection with the trade-winds and the diurnal revolution of the earth on its axis.\n\n3. The third and most remarkable motion of the sea Motion cc-is the tide, which is a regular swell of the ocean once raised by every 12 hours, owing, as Newton has demonstrated, to the attraction of the moon. In the middle of the sea the tide seldom rises higher than one or two feet,\nbut on the coast it frequently reaches the height of 45 feet, and, in some places even more. The tide generally rises higher in the evening than in the morning; on the coast of Britain this holds in winter, but in summer the morning tides are highest. In some seas it is said that there are no tides. This cannot be owing to their being surrounded by land, because there is a tide in the lakes of North America. For an explanation of these and other phenomena we refer to the article Tide.\n\nSEA-Air, that part of the atmosphere which is above the sea.\n\nSea-air has been found salubrious and remarkably beneficial in some dieteries. This may be owing to its containing a greater portion of oxygenous gas or vital air, and being less impregnated with noxious vapours than the land. Dr Ingenhouz made several experiments to ascertain the salubrity of sea-air. By mixing equal measures of common air and nitrous air, he found, that at Gavelend, they occupied about 104, or one measure and \\( \\frac{4}{100} \\) of a measure; whereas on sea, about three miles from the mouth of the Thames, two measures of air (one of common and one of nitrous air) occupied from 0.91 to 0.94. He attempted a similar experiment on the middle of the channel between the English coast and Ostend; but the motion of the ship rendered it impracticable. He found that in rainy and windy weather the sea-air contained a smaller quantity of vital air than when the weather was calm. On the sea-shore at Ostend it occupied from 94\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 97; at Bruges he found it at 105; and at Antwerp 109\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). Dr Ingenhouz thus concludes his paper:\n\nIt appears, from these experiments, that the air at sea and close to it is in general purer and fitter for animal life than the air on the land, though it seems to be subject to the same inconstancy in its degree of purity with that of the land; so that we may now with more confidence send our patients, labouring under consumption, disorders, to the sea, or at least to places situated close to the sea, which have no marshes in their neighbourhood. It seems also probable, that the air will be found in general much purer far from the land than near the shore, the former being never subject to be mixed with land air.\n\nDr Dammann, an eminent physician and professor royal of midwifery at Ghent, told Dr Ingenhouz, that when he was formerly a practitioner at Ostend, during seven years, he found the people there remarkably healthy; that nothing was rarer there than to see a patient labouring under a consumption or asthma, a malignant, putrid, or spotted fever; that the disease to which they are most subject, is a regular intermittent fever in autumn, when sudden transitions from hot to cold weather happen.\n\nPeople are in general very healthy at Gibraltar, though there are very few trees near that place; which Dr Ingenhouz thinks is owing to the purity of the air arising from the neighbourhood of the sea.\n\nMost small islands are very healthy.\n\nAt Malta people are little subject to diseases, and live to a very advanced age.\n\nSEA-Anemone.

In the Gentleman's Magazine for the year 1749, we have the account of a sea-dragon which was said to be taken between Orford and Southwold, on the coast of Suffolk, and afterwards carried round the country as a curiosity by the fishermen who caught it.\n\n\"Its head and tail (says the writer) resemble those of an alligator; it has two large fins, which serve it both to swim and to fly; and though they were so dried that I could not extend them, yet they appear, by the folds, to be shaped like those which painters have given to dragons and other winged monsters that serve as supporters to coats of arms. Its body is covered with impenetrable scales; its legs have two joints, and its feet are hoofed like those of an ass: it has five rows of very white and sharp teeth in each jaw, and is in length about four feet, though it was longer when alive, it having shrunk as it became dry.\n\n\"It was caught in a net with mackerel; and being dragged on shore, was knocked down with a stretcher or boat-hook. The net being opened, it suddenly sprung up, and flew above 50 yards: the man who first seized it had several of his fingers bitten off; and the wound mortifying, he died. It afterwards fattened on the man's arm who shows it, and lacerated it so much, that the muscles are shrunk, and the hand and fingers distorted; the wound is not yet healed, and is thought to be incurable. It is said by some to have been described by naturalists under the name of the Sea-dragon.\" We must add to the account now given of the monster called a sea-dragon, that we think it extremely probable that the animal was nothing more than a distorted or overgrown individual of some of the well known species of fish.\n\nSEA-Gage.

The first class, according to their arrangement, contained the algae, the fuci, the sea-mosses or confervas, and the different species of sponges. 2. The second contained substances of a hard texture, like stone or horn, which seem to have been of the same nature with what we call zoophyta, with this difference, that we refer sponges to this class and not to the first. The third class was the same with our lithophyta, comprehending corals, madrepora, &c. It is now well known that the genera belonging to the second and third of these classes, and even some referred to the first, are not vegetables, but animals, or the productions of animals. See CORALLINA, MADREPORA, SPONGIA. Sea-plants, then, properly speaking, belong to the class of cryptogamia, and the order of algae; and, according to Bonnare, are all comprehended under the genus of fucus. We may also add several species of the ulva and conferva and the sargazo. The fuci and marine ulvae are immersed in the sea, are seafire, and without root. The marine conferva are either seafire or floating. The sargazo grows beyond foundations.\n\nAs some species of the fucus, when dried and preserved, are extremely beautiful, the curious, and especially those who prosecute the study of botany, must be anxious to know the best method of preserving them, without destroying their colour and beauty. The following method is recommended by M. Mauduyt. Take a sheet of paper, or rather of pasteboard, and cover it with varnish on both sides; and having rowed in a boat to the rock where the fucus abounds, plunge your varnished paper into the water, and, detaching the fucus, receive it upon the paper. Agitate the paper gently in the water, that the plant may be properly spread over it; and lift them up together softly out of the water: then fix down with pins the strong stalks, that they may not be displaced, and leave the plant lying upon the varnished paper to dry in the open air. When it is fully dry, the different parts will retain their position, and the plant may be preserved within the leaves of a book. To free it from the slime and salt which adhere to it, wash it gently in fresh water, after being removed from the rock on which it grew.\n\nSEA-Serpent, a monstrous creature, said to inhabit the northern seas about Greenland and the coasts of Norway. The following marvellous account of this monster is given by Guthrie. \"In 1756, one of them was shot by a master of a ship: its head resembled that of a horse; the mouth was large and black, as were the eyes, a white mane hanging from its neck: it floated on the surface of the water, and held its head at least two feet out of the sea: between the head and neck were seven or eight folds, which were very thick; and the length of this snake was more than 100 yards, some say fathoms. They have a remarkable aversion to the smell of caffor; for which reason, ship, boat, and bark masters provide themselves with quantities of that drug, to prevent being overfed, the serpent's olfactory nerves being remarkably exquisite. The particularities related of this animal would be incredible, were they not attested upon oath. Egede, a very reputable author, says, that on the 6th day of July 1734, a large and frightful sea-monster raised itself so high out of the water, that its head reached above the main-top-mast of the ship; that it had a long sharp snout, broad paws, and spouted water like a whale; that the body seemed to be covered with scales; the skin was uneven and wrinkled, and the lower part was formed like a snake. The body of this monster is said to be as thick as a hoghead; his skin is variegated like a tortoise shell; and his excrement, which floats upon the surface of the water, is corrosive.\" Notwithstanding the belief of Guthrie, and the testimony which he produces, we cannot help doubting of the existence of the sea-serpent. Its bulk is said to be so disproportionate to all the known animals of our globe, that it requires more than ordinary evidence to render it credible; but the evidence which is offered is so very feeble and unsatisfactory, that no man of sound judgment would think it sufficient to establish the truth of an extraordinary fact.\n\nAttempts have lately been made to revive the opinion of the existence of sea-mermaids and sea-serpents. An individual of the latter, it is supposed, was some time ago thrown on shore in Orkney. Part of the skeleton is said to be in the museum of the University of Edinburgh, and another part is in the possession of Mr Home of London, who thinks that it may have belonged to an individual of some of the whale tribe, perhaps a monster of that tribe; but according to others it is to be considered as constituting a distinct genus. We cannot avoid observing, that this point must remain unsettled till other species of this new genus have been discovered, or at least till an entire individual have been described by an experienced naturalist.\n\nSEA-Sickness, a disorder incident to most persons on their first going to sea, occasioned by the agitation of the vessel. This disorder has not been much treated of, although it is very irksome and distressing to the patient during its continuance. It has, however, been found beneficial in asthmatic and pulmonary complaints, and the instances in which it has proved fatal, are extremely rare. The sea-sickness appears to be a spasmodic affection of the stomach, occasioned by the alternate pressure and release of its contents against its lower internal surface, according as the rise and fall of the ship oppose the action of gravity.\n\nThe seas in which the attacks of this disorder are accompanied with the greatest violence, are those where the waves have an uninterrupted freedom of action; and of consequence bays, gulfs and channels, may be navigated with less inconvenience, as the waves, meeting with more frequent resistance, the vessel does not experience that gentle uniform vacillation which induces sickness, and renders the head giddy. A person feels less inconvenience from the disorder in a small vessel on the wide ocean, on which the slightest motion of the waves makes a strong impression. He is also less exposed to it in a very large vessel deeply laden, as the waves, in this case, scarcely affect the vessel. It is in ships of an ordinary size, and which carry but a light cargo, that the passenger suffers most from the sea-sickness. The sooner it takes place after embarkation, the continuance of it becomes the more probable. It does not always cease immediately on landing, but in some cases continues for a considerable time.\n\nMany methods of preventing, or at least of mitigating this disorder, have been recommended, of which the most efficacious appear to be the following:\n\n1. Not to go on board immediately after eating, and not to eat, when on board, any large quantity at a time.\n\n2. To\n2. To take much exercise, with as little intermission as possible; as indolent passengers are always the greatest sufferers from the disorder.\n\n3. To keep much upon deck, even when the weather is stormy, as the sea breeze is not so apt to affect the stomach as the impure air of the cabin, rendered so for want of proper circulation.\n\n4. Not to watch the motion of the waves, particularly when strongly agitated with tempest.\n\n5. Carefully to thin all employments by which the mind may be harassed, as reading, studying, gaming, &c., and to seek all opportunities of mental relaxation.\n\n6. To drink occasionally liquids containing carbonic acid, as the froth of beer strongly fermented, or wine and Seltzer water mixed together, and sweetened with pounded sugar.\n\n7. It will also be beneficial to take sulphuric acid dulcified, dropped on a bit of sugar, or in peppermint water, or ten drops of ether.\n\nThe proper diet consists of bread and fresh meat, to be eaten cold with pepper. All sweet flavoured food should be carefully avoided, and the passenger ought to refrain from fat, and particularly from such meat as is in the smallest degree tainted. Even the smell of flowers is injurious, for which reason marine productions ought not to be examined; but the fumes of vinegar may be advantageously inhaled. The drink should consist of lemonade or tart wines, but never of common water. An accidental diarrhoea has often relieved the patient from sea-sickness, and therefore a gentle laxative in such a disorder seems to be indicated. It will also be found useful to apply a tonic anodyne plaster to the pit of the stomach, spread upon leather, and covered with linen.\n\nWhen symptoms of vomiting appear, they may often be remedied by the patient placing himself in a horizontal position on his back or belly, and lying perfectly still. If the fits of vomiting are too violent to be repressed, they should be promoted by a strong dose of salt water; not, however, to be often repeated, as it debilitates the stomach. When the emetic operates, the patient should bend his body, bringing his knees towards his breast, and supporting his head against a firm resting-place. His garters and cravat must be untied, a precaution which will secure him from the danger of a rupture.\n\nThe vomiting having subsided, a state of repose will prevent its return, and the eyes may be kept shut for a considerable time. The patient must make choice of a cool, ventilated place, remembering to keep himself warm and well clothed, as perspiration is highly beneficial. A gargle of sugar dissolved in vinegar is to be taken in the morning, accompanied with frequent and spare eating. Water must never be taken in its pure state, but mixed with wine, vinegar, or brandy. A glass of wine may be taken in the morning, with an infusion of orange peel, gentian root, or peruvian bark. A glass of punch occasionally taken will be extremely beneficial, by which perspiration is promoted.\n\nPersons accustomed to smoke tobacco, will find the use of the pipe salutary on such occasions, but the practice of smoking will be injurious to all others. We may add that warm clothing, flannel shirts, caps, trowsers, &c. are powerful remedies against excessive expectoration, with every other symptom of this dreadful malady.\n\n**SEA-Star.** See *Asterias*.\n\n**SEA-Urchin.** See *Echinus*.\n\n**SEA-Water,** the salt water of the sea. The principal salts contained in sea-water are, 1st, Common marine or culinary salt, compounded of fossil alkali or soda and marine acid; 2ndly, A salt formed by the union of the same acid with magnesian earth; and, lastly, A small quantity of selenite. The quantity of saline matter contained in a pint of sea-water, in the British seas, is, according to Neumann, about one ounce in each pint (A).\n\nThe saltness of this water is supposed to arise from numerous mines and mountains of salt dispersed here and there in the depths of the sea. Dr Halley supposes that it is probable the greatest part of the sea-salt, and of all salt lakes, as the Caspian Sea, the Dead Sea, the lake of Mexico, and the Titicaca in Peru, is derived from the water of the rivers which they receive: and since this sort of lakes has no exit or discharge but by the exhalation of vapours, and also since these vapours are entirely fresh or devoid of such particles, it is certain that the saltness of the sea and of such lakes must from time to time increase; and therefore the saltness at this time must be greater than at any time heretofore. He further adds, that if, by experiments made in different ages, we could find the different quantity of salt which the same quantity of water (taken up in the same place, and in all other the same circumstances) would afford, it would be easy from thence, by rules of proportion, to find the age of the world very nearly, or the time wherein it has been acquiring its present saltness.\n\nThis opinion of Dr Halley is so improbable, that it is surprising so acute a philosopher could have adopted it. That fresh water rivers should in the course of many thousand years produce saltness in the sea, is quite incredible. If this were the case, every sea or great body of water which receives rivers must be salt, and must possess a degree of saltness in proportion to the quantity of water which the rivers discharge. But\n\n---\n\n(A) In Bergman's analysis of sea-water taken up in the beginning of June 1776, about the latitude of the Canaries, from the depth of 65 fathoms, the solid contents of a pint of the water were,\n\n| Substance       | Grs. |\n|-----------------|------|\n| Of common salt  | 233.8 |\n| Salted magnesia | 69.7 |\n| Gyplum          | 8.7 |\n| **Total**       | **330.2** |\n\nor 5 3 Grs. 1 10 1\nSo far is this from being true, that the Palus Meotis and the great lakes in America do not contain salt but fresh water. It may indeed be objected, that the quantity of salt which the rivers carry along with them and deposit in the sea, must depend on the nature of the soil through which they flow, which may in some places contain no salt at all; and this may be the reason why the great lakes in America and the Palus Meotis are fresh. But to this opinion, which is merely hypothetical, there are unanswerable objections. It is a curious fact that the saltness of the sea is greatest under the line, and diminishes gradually as we advance to the poles: We must therefore suppose, if Dr Halley's theory be true, that the earth contains more salt in the tropical regions than in the temperate zones, and more in the temperate zones than in the frigid; and consequently that the rivers in these different regions contain a quantity of salt proportionable to their distance from the equator. This, however, must be first proved by experiment, and cannot be assumed as an established fact. But there is another circumstance that entirely destroys this theory. If we allow that the sea receives its saltness from the rivers, it must be equally salt or nearly so in every part of the earth. For, according to a simple and well-known principle in chemistry, \"when any substance is dissolved in water with the assistance of agitation, at whatever part of the water it is introduced, it will be equally diffused through the whole liquid.\" Now though it were true that a greater quantity of salt were introduced into the sea under the line than towards the poles, from the constant agitation occasioned by the wind and tide, the salt must soon pervade the whole mass of water. To say that the superior degree of heat in the tropical regions may dissolve a greater quantity of salt, will not destroy our argument; for it is an established principle in chemistry, that cold water will dissolve nearly as great a quantity of salt as hot water can dissolve.\n\nThe saltness of the sea has also been ascribed to the solution of subterraneous mines of salt which is supposed to abound in the bottom of the sea and along its shores. But this hypothesis cannot be supported. If the sea were constantly dissolving salt, it would soon become saturated; for it cannot be said that it is deprived of any part of its salt by evaporation, since rain-water is fresh. If the sea were to become saturated, neither fishes nor vegetables could live in it. We must therefore despair of being able to account for the saltness of the sea by second causes; and must suppose that it has been salt from the creation. It is impossible indeed to suppose that the waters of the sea were at any period fresh since the formation of fishes and sea-plants: for as these will not live in water saturated with salt, neither will they live in water that is fresh; we therefore conclude that the saltness of the sea has been nearly the same in all ages. This is the simplest hypothesis of the three that has been mentioned. It explains best the various phenomena, and is involved in fewest difficulties. We shall, however, allow that there may be some exceptions; that the saltness of some seas, or of particular parts of the same sea, may be increased by mines of rock-salt dispersed near its shores.\n\nWith regard to the use of this salt property of sea-water, it is observed, that the saltness of the sea preserves its waters pure and sweet, which otherwise would corrupt and stink like a filthy lake, and consequently that none of the myriads of creatures which now live therein could then have a being. From thence also the sea water becomes much heavier, and therefore ships of greater size and quantity may be used thereon. Salt-water also doth not freeze so soon as fresh-water, whence the seas are more free for navigation. We have a dissertation, by Dr Ruffel, concerning the medical uses of sea-water in diseases of the glands, &c., wherein the author premises some observations upon the nature of sea-water, considered as impregnated with particles of all the bodies it passes over, such as submarine plants, fish, fogs, minerals, &c., and saturated with their several effluvia, to enrich it and keep it from putrefaction; whence this fluid is supposed to contract a soapiness; and the whole collection, being pervaded by the sulphurous streams passing through it, to constitute what we call sea-water; the confessed distinguishing characteristics of which are saltness, bitterness, nitrocity, and uncleanness; whence the author concludes, that it may be justly expected to contribute signally to the improvement of physic. The cases in which our author informs us we are to expect advantages from sea-water are, 1. In all recent obstructions of the glands of the intestines and mesentery. 2. All recent obstructions of the pulmonary glands, and those of the viscera, which frequently produce consumptions. 3. All recent glandular swellings of the neck, or other parts. 4. Recent tumors of the joints, if they are not suppurrated, or become chilious or cancerous, and have not carious bones for their cause. 5. Recent defluxions upon the glands of the eyelids. 6. All defecations of the skin, from erysipelas to lepra. 7. Diseases of the glands of the nose, with their usual companion a thickness of the lip. 8. Obstructions of the kidneys, where there is no inflammation, and the stone not large. 9. In recent obstructions of the liver, this method will be proper, where it prevents constipations of the belly, and afflicts other medicines directed in icterical cases. The same remedy is said to be of signal service in the bronchocele; and is likewise recommended for the prevention of those bilious colics that so frequently affect our mariners.\n\nPreservation of Sea-Water from Putrefaction. As it is sometimes necessary to preserve sea-water in casks for bathing and other purposes, it is of importance to know how to keep it from putrefaction. Many experiments were made to determine this point by Mr Henry, and are recorded in the first volume of the Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester. His first experiment we shall here present to our readers. \"To one quart of sea-water were added two scruples of fresh quick-lime; to another, half an ounce of common culinary salt; and a third was kept as a standard, without any addition. The mouths of the bottles being loosely covered with paper, they were exposed to the action of the sun in some of the hottest weather in summer. In about a week the standard became very offensive; and the water, with the additional quantity of salt, did not continue sweet many hours longer; whereas that with lime continued many months without ever exhibiting the least marks of putridity.\" When he added a dram more of quicklime, the whole of the magnesia contained in the water was separated; and when a further addition was made, a lime-water was immediately\nimmediately formed. He therefore concluded, that two scruples of quicklime are sufficient to preserve a quart of sea-water. The proportions, however, may vary a little, according to the strength of the quicklime employed.\n\n**Freshening of SEA.Water.** The method of making sea-water fresh was long a desideratum in navigation. Many methods have been proposed for this purpose. Mr Appleby published an account of a process which he had instituted in the year 1734. He distilled sea-water with a quantity of *lapis infernalis* and calcined bones; but this process was soon laid aside, as it was not only difficult in itself, but rendered the water unpalatable. Dr Butler proposed soap-leys in place of Mr Appleby's ingredients; but the water was still liable to the same objection. Dr Stephen Hales recommended powdered chalk; but his method was expensive, and did not improve the taste of the water. Dr Lind of Portsmouth distilled sea-water without any ingredients; but as the experiment he made was performed in a vessel containing only two quarts, with a glass receiver, in his study, nothing conclusive can be drawn from it for the use of Dr Irving's sailors. At length Dr Irving brought the process to a very high degree of simplicity and perfection, by which the water is obtained pure, without much expense of fuel or a complicated apparatus. For this valuable discovery he received a reward of £500. The advantages of this method remain to be stated, which may be reduced to the following: 1. The abolishing all stills, still-heads, worm-pipes, and their tubes, which occupy so much space as to render them totally incompatible with the necessary business of the ship; and using in the room of these the ship's kettle or boiler, to the top whereof may occasionally be applied a simple tube, which can be easily made on board a vessel at sea, of iron plate, stove funnel, or tin sheet; so that no situation can prevent a ship from being completely supplied with the means of distilling sea-water. 2. In consequence of the principles of distillation being fully ascertained, the contrivance of the simplest means of obtaining the greatest quantity of distilled water, by making the tube sufficiently large to receive the whole column of vapour, and placing it nearly in a horizontal direction, to prevent any compression of the fluid, which takes place too much with the common worm. 3. The adopting of the simplest and most efficacious means of condensing vapour; for nothing more is required in the distillation but keeping the surface of the tube always wet, which is done by having some sea-water at hand, and a person to dip a mop or wab into this water, and pass it along the upper surface of the tube. By this operation the vapour contained in the tube will be entirely condensed with the greatest rapidity imaginable; for by the application of the wet mop thin sheets of water are uniformly spread, and mechanically pressed upon the surface of the hot tube; which being converted into vapour make way for a succession of fresh sheets; and thus, both by the evaporation and close contact of the cold water constantly repeated, the heat is carried off more effectually than by any other method yet known. 4. The carrying on the distillation without any addition, a correct chemical analysis of sea-water having evinced the futility of mixing ingredients with it, either to prevent an acid from rising with the vapour, or to destroy any bituminous oil supposed to exist in sea-water, and to contaminate the distilled water, giving it that fiery unpalatable taste inseparable from the former processes. 5. The ascertaining the proper quantity of sea-water that ought to be distilled, whereby the fresh water is prevented from contracting a noxious impregnation of metallic salts, and the vessel from being corroded and otherwise damaged by the salts caking on the bottom of it. 6. The producing a quantity of sweet and wholesome water, perfectly agreeable to the taste, and sufficient for all the purposes of drinking. 7. The taking advantage of the dressing the ship's provisions, so as to distil a very considerable quantity of water from the vapour, which would otherwise be lost, without any addition of fuel. To sum up the merits of this method in a few words: The use of a simple tube, of the most easy construction, applicable to any ship's kettle. The rejecting all ingredients; ascertaining the proportion of water to be distilled, with every advantage of quality, saving of fuel, and preservation of boilers. The obtaining fresh water, wholesome, palatable, and in sufficient quantities. Taking advantage of the vapour which ascends in the kettle while the ship's provisions are boiling. All these advantages are obtained by the above mentioned simple addition to the common ship's kettles. But Dr Irving proposes to introduce two further improvements. The first is a hearth, or flue, so constructed that the fire which is kept up the whole day for the common business of the ship serves likewise for distillation; whereby a sufficient quantity of water for all the economical purposes of the ship may be obtained, with a very inconsiderable addition to the expense of fuel. The other improvement is that of substituting, even in the largest ships, cast-iron boilers, of a new construction, in the place of coppers.\n\nAs soon as sea-water is put into the boiler, the tube directions are to be fitted either into the top or lid, round which, if for distillation necessary, a bit of wet linen may be applied, to make ing sea-water fit close to the mouth of the vessel; there will be no occasion for luting, as the tube acts like a funnel in carrying off the vapour. When the water begins to boil, the vapour should be allowed to pass freely for a minute, which will effectually clean the tube and upper part of the boiler. The tube is afterwards to be kept constantly wet, by passing a mop or wab, dipped in sea-water, along its upper surface. The waste water running from the mop may be carried off by means of a board made like a spout, and placed beneath the tube. The distillation may be continued till three-fourths of the water be drawn off, and no further. This may be ascertained either by a gauge-rod put into the boiler, or by measuring the water distilled. The brine is then to be let out. Water may be distilled in the same manner while the provisions are boiling. When the tube is made of iron, the best substance for the purpose is thin copper well tinned, this being more durable in long voyages than tin-plates. Instead of mopping, the tube, if required, may have a cage made also of copper, so much larger in diameter as to admit a thin sheet of water to circulate between them by means of a spiral copper thread, with a pipe of an inch diameter at each end of the cage; the lower for receiving cold water, and the upper for carrying it off when heated.\n\nWhen only a very small portion of room can be conveniently allowed for distillation, the machine (fig. 2), which is only 27 inches long, may be substituted, as\nwas done in this voyage. The principal intention of this machine, however, is to distil rum and other liquors; for which purpose it has been employed with extraordinary success, in preventing an empyreuma, or fiery taste.\n\nFigure 1. represents in perspective a section of the two boilers taken out of the frame. In the back part at D, E, are seen openings for the cocks. On the top is a distilling tube A, B, C, five inches diameter at A, and decreasing in size to three inches at C; the length from B to C is five feet. Near C is a ring to prevent the water which is applied to the surface from mixing with the distilled water. In the inside of the tube, below B, is a small lip or ledgeing, to hinder the distilled water from returning into the boiler by the rolling of the ship.\n\nIn figure 2. A, B, C, D, represent a vertical section of a copper box, 27 inches long, seven inches wide, and 11 inches high, tinned on the inside. In the bottom F is an aperture about six inches in diameter, having a ring to fit on the still or boiler. The dotted lines which run nearly horizontal, are vefels of thin copper, tinned on the outside, two feet long, seven inches wide, and three quarters of an inch deep. At G is a funnel to receive cold water, which is conveyed into the vefels by communicating pipes, contrived in such a manner as to form a complete and quick circulation of the water through their whole extent. When the water is become hot by the action of the steam, it is discharged by the horizontal pipe at A. E is a pipe from which the distilled water or spirits run, and is bent in such a form that the liquor running from it acts as a valve, and hinders any steam from escaping that way. On the top of the box, at H, is a safety-valve, which prevents any danger from a great accumulation of vapour not condensed for want of a proper supply of cold water.\n\nWe shall now mention a different method, discovered by the Chevalier Lorgna, by congelation of sea-water. Sea-water requires a very great degree of cold in order to become ice. Our author found that a freezing mixture, made by mixing three parts of pounded ice with two parts of common salt, was quite sufficient to freeze it. The cold produced by this mixture is equal to about 4° below 0° Fahrenheit's thermometer.\n\nA quantity of sea-water is never entirely congealed, a portion of it always remaining fluid; and what is very remarkable, this fluid part is incomparably more full of salt and more nauseous than the rest; hence, if this be separated from the congealed part, the latter on being melted will be found to contain much less salt than it did before congelation. This we shall call the water of the first purification.\n\nIf the water of the first purification be again congealed, a part of it will remain fluid as in the first operation. This fluid portion will contain a greater proportion of salt than the rest, which is of course more pure, and, being melted, forms the water of the second purification. Thus, by repeatedly freezing the same sea-water, and separating the fluid from the congealed part in every operation, it is at last perfectly purified, so as to be entirely divested of salt, and as fit for drink and other purposes as the purest water that is used.\n\nAt first the sea-water, in order to be congealed, requires a very great degree of cold, as mentioned above, the ice formed in it consists rather of scales or filaments than of a compact body, and the quantity of the fluid parts bears a considerable proportion to the quantity of ice. But as the water, by undergoing the successive congelations, becomes more and more pure, so it becomes capable of being congealed by a smaller and smaller degree of cold; the ice is at the same time more compact, and in greater quantity; the fluid part at last becoming very inconsiderable.\n\nSea-Weed, or Alga Marina, is commonly used as a manure on the sea-coast, where it can be procured in abundance. The best sort grows on rocks, and is that from which kelp is made. The next to this is called the peaty sea-weed; and the worst is that with a long stalk. In the neighbourhood of Berwick, the farmers mix it with stable dung and earth, and thus obtain a great quantity of excellent manure. Sea-weed is found also to be a very fit manure for gardens, as it not only enriches them, but destroys the vermin by which they are usually infested.\n\nSea-Wolf.

See PACIFIC Ocean, and SOUTH Sea.\n\nSEAL, a punchen, piece of metal, or other matter, usually either round or oval; wherein are engraven the arms, device, &c. of some prince, state, community, magistrate, or private person, often with a legend or inscription; the impression whereof in wax serves to make acts, instruments, &c. authentic.\n\nThe use of seals, as a mark of authenticity to letters and other instruments in writing, is extremely ancient. We read of it among the Jews and Persians in the earliest and most sacred records of history. And in the book of Jeremiah there is a very remarkable instance, not only of an attestation by seal, but also of the other usual formalities attending a Jewish purchase. In the civil law also, seals were the evidence of truth, and were required, on the part of the witnesses at least, at the attestation of every testament. But in the times of our Saxon ancestors, they were not much in use in England. For though Sir Edward Coke relies on an instance of King Edwyn's making use of a seal about 100 years before the Conquest, yet it does not follow that this was the usage among the whole nation: and perhaps the charter he mentions may be of doubtful authority, from this very circumstance of its being sealed; since we are assured by all our ancient historians that sealing was not then in common use. The method of the Saxons was, for such as could write to subscribe their names, and, whether they could write or not, to affix the sign of the cross; which custom our illiterate vulgar do for the most part to this day keep up, by signing a cross for their mark when unable to write their names. And indeed this inability to write, and therefore making a cross in its stead, is honestly avowed by Credwalla, a Saxon king, at the end of one of his charters. In like manner, and for the same infirmity, at their first settlement in France used the practice of sealing only, without writing their names; which custom continued when learning made its way among them, though the reason for doing it had ceased; and hence the charter of Edward the Confessor to Westminster-abbey, himself being brought up in Normandy, was witnessed only by his seal, and is generally thought to be the oldest sealed charter of any authenticity in England.\nSEA\n\nAt the Conquest, the Norman lords brought over into this kingdom their own fashions; and introduced waxen seals only, instead of the English method of writing their names, and signing with the sign of the cross. The imprestions of these seals were sometimes a knight on horseback, sometimes other devices; but coats of arms were not introduced into seals, nor indeed used at all till about the reign of Richard I., who brought them from the croisade in the Holy Land, where they were first invented and painted on the shields of the knights, to distinguish the variety of persons of every Christian nation who resorted thither, and who could not, when clad in complete steel, be otherwise known or ascertained.\n\nThis neglect of signing, and resting only upon the authenticity of seals, remained very long among us; for it was held in all our books, that sealing alone was sufficient to authenticate a deed: and so the common form of attesting deeds, \"sealed and delivered,\" continues to this day; notwithstanding the statute 29 Car. II. c. 3, revives the Saxon custom, and expressly directs the signing in all grants of lands and many other species of deeds: in which, therefore, signing seems to be now as necessary as sealing, though it hath been sometimes held that the one includes the other.\n\nThe king's great seal is that whereby all patents, commissions, warrants, &c. coming down from the king are sealed; the keeping whereof is in the hands of the lord chancellor. The king's privy seal is a seal that is usually first set to grants that are to pass the great seal.\n\nSEAL. See KEEPER of the Privy Seal.\n\nSEAMANSHIP.\n\nBy this word we express that noble art, or, more purely, the qualifications which enable a man to exercise the noble art of working a ship. A seaman, in the language of the profession, is not merely a mariner or labourer on board a ship, but a man who understands the structure of this wonderful machine, and every subordinate part of its mechanism, so as to enable him to employ it to the best advantage for pushing her forward in a particular direction, and for avoiding the numberless dangers to which she is exposed by the violence of the winds and waves. He also knows what courses can be held by the ship, according to the wind that blows, and what cannot, and which of these is most conducive to her progress in her intended voyage; and he must be able to perform every part of the necessary operation with his own hands. As the seamen express it, he must be able \"to hand, reef, and steer.\"\n\nWe are justified in calling it a noble art, not only by its importance, which it is quite needless to amplify or embellish, but by its immense extent and difficulty, and the prodigious number and variety of principles on which it is founded—all of which must be possessed in such a manner that they shall offer themselves without reflection in an instant, otherwise the pretended seaman is but a lubber, and cannot be trusted on his watch.\n\nThe art is practised by persons without what we call education, and in the humbler walks of life, and therefore it suffers in the estimation of the careless spectator. It is thought little of, because little attention is paid to it. But if multiplicity, variety, and intricacy of principles, and a systematic knowledge of these principles, entitle any art to the appellation of scientific and liberal, seamanship claims these epithets in an eminent degree. We are amused with the pedantry of the seaman, which appears in his whole language. Indeed it is the only pedantry that amuses. A scholar, a soldier, a lawyer, nay, even the elegant courtier, would disgust us, were he to make the thousandth part of the allusions to his profession that is well received from the jolly seaman; and we do the seaman no more than justice. His profession may engross his whole mind; otherwise he can never learn it. He possesses a prodigious deal of knowledge; but the honest tar cannot tell what he knows, or rather what he feels, for his science is really at his fingers' ends. We can say with confidence, that if a person of education, versed in mechanics, and acquainted with the structure of a ship, were to observe with attention the movements which are made on board a first or second rate ship of war during a shifting storm, under the direction of an intelligent officer, he would be rapt in admiration.\n\nWhat a pity it is that an art so important, so difficult, and so intimately connected with the invariable laws of mechanical nature, should be so held by its possessors, that it cannot improve, but must die with each individual. Having no advantages of previous education,\nSEAMANSHIP.\n\ntion, they cannot arrange their thoughts; they can hardly be said to think. They can far less express or communicate to others the intuitive knowledge which they possess; and their art, acquired by habit alone, is little different from an instinct. We are as little entitled to expect improvement here as in the architecture of the bee or the beaver. The species (pardon the allusion, ye generous hearts of oak) cannot improve. Yet a ship is a machine. We know the forces which act on it, and we know the results of its construction—all these are as fixed as the laws of motion. What hinders this to be reduced to a set of practical maxims, as well founded and as logically deduced as the working of a steam engine or a cotton mill. The fitter or the spinner acts only with his hands, and may \"whistle as he works, for want of thought;\" but the mechanist, the engineer, thinks for him, improves his machine, and directs him to a better practice. May not the rough seaman look for the same assistance; and may not the ingenious speculator in his closet unravel the intricate thread of mechanism which connects all the manual operations with the unchangeable laws of nature, and both furnish the seaman with a better machine and direct him to a more dexterous use of it?\n\nWe cannot help thinking that much may be done; may, we may say that much has been done. We think highly of the progressive labours of Renard, Pitot, Bouguer, Du Hamel, Groignard, Bernoulli, Euler, Romme, and others; and are both surprised and sorry that Britain has contributed so little in their attempts. Gordon is the only one of our countrymen who has given a professedly scientific treatise on a small branch of the subject. The government of France has always been strongly impressed with the notion of great improvements being attainable by systematic study of this art; and we are indebted to the endeavours of that ingenious nation for any thing of practical importance that has been obtained. M. Bouguer was professor of hydrology at one of the marine academies of France, and was enjoined, as part of his duty, to compose dissertations both on the construction and the working of ships. His Traité du Navire, and his Manœuvre des Voiles, are undoubtedly very valuable performances: So are those of Euler and Bernoulli, considered as mathematical dissertations, and they are wonderful works of genius, considered as the productions of persons who hardly ever saw a ship, and were totally unacquainted with the profession of a seaman. In this respect Bouguer had great superiority, having always lived at a sea port, and having made many very long voyages. His treaties therefore are infinitely better accommodated to the demands of the seaman, and more directly instructive; but still the author is more a mathematician than an artist, and his performance is intelligible only to mathematicians. It is true, the academical education of the young gentlemen of the French navy is such, that a great number of them may acquire the preparatory knowledge that is necessary; and we are well informed that, in this respect, the officers of the British navy are greatly inferior to them.\n\nBut this very circumstance has furnished to many persons an argument against the utility of those performances. It is said that, notwithstanding this superior mathematical education, and the possession of those boasted performances of M. Bouguer, the French are greatly inferior, in point of seamanship, to our countrymen, who have not a page in their language to instruct them, and who could not peruse it if they had it.\" Nay, so little do the French themselves seem sensible of the advantage of these publications, that no person among them has attempted to make a familiar abridgement of them, written in a way fitted to attract attention; and they still remain neglected in their original abstruse and unintelligible form.\n\nWe wish that we could give a satisfactory answer to this observation. It is just, and it is important. These very ingenious and learned dissertations are by no means so useful as we should expect. They are large books, and appear to contain much; and as their plan is logical, it seems to occupy the whole subject, and therefore to have done almost all that can be done. But, alas! they have only opened the subject, and the study is yet in its infancy. The whole science of the art must proceed on the knowledge of the impulsion of the wind and water. These are the forces which act on the machine; and its motions, which are the ultimatum of our research, whether as an end to be obtained or as a thing to be prevented, must depend on these forces. Now it is with respect to this fundamental point that we are as yet almost totally in the dark. And, in the performances of M. Bouguer, as also in those of the other authors we have named, the theory of these forces, by which their quantity and the direction of their action fundamentally affected, is altogether erroneous; and its results will prudently deviate so enormously from what is observed in the examples; of a ship, that the person who should direct the operations on shipboard, in conformity to the maxims deducible from M. Bouguer's propositions, would be baffled in most of his attempts, and be in danger of losing the ship. The whole proceeds on the supposed truth of that theory which states the impulse of a fluid to be in the proportion of the square of the sine of the angle of incidence; and that its action on any small portion, such as a square foot of the sails or hull, is the same as if that portion were detached from the rest, and were exposed, single and alone, to the wind or water in the same angle. But we have shown, in the article RESISTANCE OF FLUIDS, both from theory and experience, that both of these principles are erroneous, and this to a very great degree, in cases which occur most frequently in practice, that is, in the small angles of inclination. When the wind falls nearly perpendicular on the sails, theory is not very erroneous; but in these cases, the circumstances of the ship's situation are generally such that the practice is easy, occurring almost without thought; and in this case, too, even considerable deviations from the very best practice are of no great moment. The interesting cases, where the intended movement requires or depends upon very oblique actions of the wind on the sails, and its practicability or impracticability depends on a very small variation of this obliquity; a mistake of the force, either as to intensity or direction, produces a mighty effect on the resulting motion. This is the case in tacking to windward; the most important of all the general problems of seamanship. The trim of the sails, and the course of the ship, so as to gain most on the wind, are very nice things; that is, they are confined within very narrow limits, and a small mistake produces a very considerable effect. The same thing obtains in many of the nice problems.\nThe error in the second assertion of the theory is still greater, and the action on one part of the sail or hull is so greatly modified by its action on another adjoining part, that a stay-sail is often seen hanging like a loose rag, although there is nothing between it and the wind; and this merely because a great sail in its neighbourhood tends off a lateral stream of wind, which completely hinders the wind from getting at it. Till the theory of the action of fluids be established, therefore, we cannot tell what are the forces which are acting on every point of the sail and hull: Therefore we cannot tell either the mean intensity or direction of the whole force which acts on any particular sail, nor the intensity and mean direction of the resistance to the hull; circumstances absolutely necessary for enabling us to say what will be their energy in producing a rotation round any particular axis. In like manner, we cannot, by such a computation, find the spontaneous axis of conversion (see Rotation), or the velocity of such conversion. In short, we cannot pronounce with tolerable confidence a priori what will be the motions in any case, or what dispositions of the sails will produce the movement we wish to perform. The experienced seaman learns by habit the general effects of every disposition of the sails; and though his knowledge is far from being accurate, it seldom leads him into any very blundering operation. Perhaps he seldom makes the best adjustment possible, but seldom still does he deviate very far from it; and in the most general and important problems, such as working to windward, the result of much experience and many corrections has settled a trim of the sails, which is certainly not far from the truth, but (it must be acknowledged) deviates widely and uniformly from the theories of the mathematician's closet. The honest tar, therefore, must be indulged in his joke on the useless labours of the mathematician, who can neither hand, reef, nor steer.\n\nAfter this account of the theoretical performances in the art of seamanship, and what we have said in another place on the small hopes we entertain of seeing a perfect theory of the impulse of fluids, it will not be expected that we enter very minutely on the subject in this place; nor is it our intention. But let it be observed, that the theory is defective in one point only; and although this is a most important point, and the errors in it destroy the conclusions of the chief propositions, the reasonings remain in full force, and the modus operandi is precisely such as is stated in the theory. The principles of the art are therefore to be found in these treatises; but false inferences have been drawn, by computing from erroneous quantities. The rules and the practice of the computation, however, are still beyond controversy: Nay, since the process of investigation is legitimate, we may make use of it in order to discover the very circumstance in which we are at present mistaken: for by converting the proposition, instead of finding the motions by means of the supposed forces, combined with the known mechanism, we may discover the forces by means of this mechanism and the observed motions.\n\nWe shall therefore in this place give a very general view of the movements of a ship under sail, showing how they are produced and modified by the action of the wind on her sails, the water on her rudder and on her bows. We shall not attempt a precise determination of any of these movements; but we shall say enough to enable the curious landsman to understand how this mighty machine is managed amidst the fury of the winds and waves: and, what is more to our wish, we hope to enable the uninstructed but thinking seaman to generalize that knowledge which he possesses; to clear his ideas, and give them a sort of rational system; and even to improve his practice, by making him sensible of the immediate operation of every thing he does, and in what manner it contributes to produce the movement which he has in view.\n\nA ship may be considered at present as a mass of inert matter in free space, at liberty to move in every direction, according to the forces which impel or resist her; and when she is in actual motion, in the direction of her course, we may still consider her as at rest in absolute space, but exposed to the impulse of a current of water opposite moving equally fast in the opposite direction: for in both cases the prelude of the water on her bows is the same; and we know that it is possible, and frequently happens in currents, that the impulse of the wind on her sails, and that of the water on her bows, balance each other so precisely, that she not only does not stir from the place, but also remains steadily in the same position, with her head directed to the same point of the compass. This state of things is easily conceived by any person accustomed to consider mechanical subjects, and every seaman of experience has observed it. It is of importance to consider it in this point of view, because it gives us the most familiar notion of the manner in which these forces of the wind and water are set in opposition, and made to balance or not to balance each other by the intervention of the ship, in the same manner as the goods and the weights balance each other in the scales by the intervention of a beam or teelyard.\n\nWhen a ship proceeds steadily in her course, without changing her rate of sailing, or varying the direction of the wind her head, we must in the first place conceive the accumulated impulses of the wind on all her sails as precisely opposite to those of the water on her bows. In the next place, because the ship the bow does not change the direction of her keel, she resembles the balanced teelyard, in which the energies of the two weights, which tend to produce rotations in opposite directions, and thus to change the position of the beam, mutually balance each other round the fulcrum; so the energies of the actions of the wind on the different sails balance the energies of the water on the different parts of the hull.\n\nThe seaman has two principal tasks to perform. The first is to keep the ship steadily in that course which will bring her farther on in the line of her intended voyage. This is frequently very different from that line, and the choice of the best course is sometimes a matter of considerable difficulty. It is sometimes possible to shape the course precisely along the line of the intended voyage; and yet the intelligent seaman knows that he played in will arrive sooner, or with greater safety, at his port, by taking a different course; because he will gain more by increasing his speed than he loses by increasing the distance. Some principle must direct him in the selection of this course. This we must attempt to lay before the reader.\n\nHaving chosen such a course as he thinks most advantageous,\ntageous, he must set such a quantity of sail as the strength of the wind will allow him to carry with safety and effect, and must trim the sails properly, or to adjust their positions to the direction of the wind, that they may have the greatest possible tendency to impel the ship in the line of her course, and to keep her steadily in that direction.\n\nHis other task is to produce any deviations which he sees proper from the present course of the ship; and to produce these in the most certain, the safest, and the most expeditious manner. It is chiefly in this movement that the mechanical nature of a ship comes into view, and it is here that the superior address and resource of an expert seaman is to be perceived.\n\nUnder the article Sailing some notice has been taken of the first task of the seaman, and it was there shown how a ship, after having taken up her anchor and fitted her sails, accelerates her motion, by degrees which continually diminish, till the increasing resistance of the water becomes precisely equal to the diminished impulse of the wind, and then the motion continues uniformly the same so long as the wind continues to blow with the same force and in the same direction.\n\nIt is perfectly consonant to experience that the impulse of fluids is in the duplicate ratio of the relative velocity. Let it be supposed that when water moves one foot per second, its perpendicular pressure or impulse on a square foot is $m$ pounds. Then, if it be moving with the velocity $V$ estimated in feet per second, its perpendicular impulse on a surface $S$, containing any number of square feet, must be $m SV^2$.\n\nIn like manner, the impulse of air on the same surface may be represented by $n SV^2$; and the proportion of the impulse of these two fluids will be that of $m$ to $n$. We may express this by the ratio of $q$ to $1$, making\n\n$$\\frac{m}{n} = q.$$  \n\nM. Bouguer's computations and tables are on the supposition that the impulse of sea-water moving one foot per second is 23 ounces on a square foot, and that the impulse of the wind is the same when it blows at the rate of 24 feet per second. These measures are all French. They by no means agree with the experiments of others; and what we have already said, when treating of the Resistance of Fluids, is enough to show us that nothing like precise measures can be expected. It was shown as the result of a rational investigation, and confirmed by the experiments of Buat and others, that the impulsions and resistances at the same surface, with the same obliquity of incidence and the same velocity of motion, are different according to the form and situation of the adjoining parts. Thus the total resistance of a thin board is greater than that of a long prism, having this board for its front or bow, &c.\n\nWe are greatly at a loss what to give as absolute measures of these impulsions.\n\n1. With respect to water. The experiments of the French academy on a prism two feet broad and deep and four feet long, indicate a resistance of 0.973 pounds avoirdupois to a square foot, moving with the velocity of one foot per second at the surface of still water.\n\nMr Boat's experiments on a square foot wholly immersed in a stream were as follows:\n\n- A square foot as a thin plate: 1,81 pounds.\n- Ditto as the front of a box one foot long: 1,42 pounds.\n- Ditto as the front of a box three feet long: 1,29 pounds.\n\nThe resistance of sea-water is about $\\frac{1}{3}$ greater.\n\n2. With respect to air, the varieties are as great. The resistance of a square foot to air moving with the velocity of one foot per second appears from Mr Robin's experiments on 16 square inches to be on a square foot:\n\n- Chevalier Borda's on 16 inches: 0.001596 pounds,\n- on 81 inches: 0.002042 pounds,\n- Mr Roufe's on large surfaces: 0.002291 pounds.\n\nPrecise measures are not to be expected, nor are they necessary in this inquiry. Here we are chiefly interested in their proportions, as they may be varied by their mode of action in the different circumstances of obliquity and velocity.\n\nWe begin by recurring to the fundamental proposition concerning the impulse of fluids, viz., that the absolute pressure is always in a direction perpendicular to the impelled surface, whatever may be the direction of the stream of fluid. We must therefore illustrate the doctrine, by always supposing a flat surface of sail stretched on a yard, which can be braced about in any direction, and giving this sail such a position and such perpendicular extent of surface that the impulse on it may be the same both as to direction and intensity with that on the real sails. Thus the consideration is greatly simplified. The direction of the impulse is therefore perpendicular to the yard. Its intensity depends on the velocity with which the wind meets the sail, and the obliquity of its stroke. We shall adopt the constructions founded on the common doctrine, that the impulse is, as the square of the sine of the inclination, because they are simple; whereas, if we were to introduce the values of the oblique impulses, such as they have been observed in the excellent experiments of the Academy of Paris, the constructions would be complicated in the extreme, and we could hardly draw any consequences which would be intelligible to any but expert mathematicians. The conclusions will be erroneous, not in kind but in quantity only; and we shall point out the necessary corrections, so that the final results will be found not very different from real observation.\n\nIf a ship were a round cylindrical body like a flat tub, floating on its bottom, and fitted with a mast compared fail in the centre, she would always fail in a direction perpendicular to the yard. This is evident. But she is an oblong body, and may be compared to a chaff, whose length greatly exceeds its breadth. She is so shaped, that a moderate force will push her through the water with the head or stern foremost; but it requires a very great force to push her sidewise with the same velocity. A fine sailing ship of war will require about 12 times as much force to push her sidewise as to push her head foremost. In this respect therefore she will very much resemble a chaff whose length is 12 times its breadth; and whatever be the proportion of these resistances in different ships, we may always substitute a box which shall have the same resistances headwise and sidewise.\n\nLet $EFGH$ (fig. 1.) be the horizontal section of such\nsuch a box, and AB its middle line, and C its centre. In whatever direction this box may chance to move, the direction of the whole resistance on its two sides will pass through C. For as the whole stream has one inclination to the side EF, the equivalent of the equal impulses on every part will be in a line perpendicular to the middle of EF. For the same reason, it will be in a line perpendicular to the middle of FG. These perpendiculars must cross in C. Suppose a mast erected at C, and YC y to be a yard hoisted on it carrying a sail. Let the yard be first conceived as braced right athwart at right angles to the keel, as represented by Y' y'. Then, whatever be the direction of the wind abaft this sail, it will impel the vessel in the direction CB. But if the sail has the oblique position Y y', the impulse will be in the direction CD perpendicular to CY, and will both push the vessel ahead and sidewise: For the impulse CD is equivalent to the two impulses CK and CI (the sides of a rectangle of which CD is the diagonal). The force CI pushes the vessel ahead, and CK pushes her sidewise. She must therefore take some intermediate direction a b, such that the resistance of the water to the plane FG is to its resistance to the plane EF as CI to CK.\n\nThe angle b CB between the real course and the direction of the head is called the Leeway; and in the course of this dissertation we shall express it by the symbol x. It evidently depends on the shape of the vessel and on the position of the yard. An accurate knowledge of the quantity of leeway, corresponding to different circumstances of obliquity of impulse, extent of surface, &c., is of the utmost importance in the practice of navigation; and even an approximation is valuable. The subject is so very difficult that this must content us for the present.\n\nLet V be the velocity of the ship in the direction C b, and let the surfaces FG and F'E be called A' and B'. Then the resistance to the lateral motion is $mV^2 \\times B' \\times \\text{fine}^2 bCB$, and that to the direct motion is $mV^2 \\times A' \\times \\text{fine}^2 bCK$, or $mV^2 \\times A' \\times \\text{col}^2 bCB$. Therefore these resistances are in the proportion of $B' \\times \\text{fine}^2 x$ to $A' \\times \\text{col}^2 x$ (representing the angle of leeway b CB by the symbol x).\n\nTherefore we have CI : CK, or CI : ID = A': col. $x$: B': fine $x$, = A': B': tan. $x$ = A : B : tan. $x$.\n\nLet the angle YCB, to which the yard is braced up, be called the Trim of the sails, and expressed by the symbol b. This is the complement of the angle DCI. Now CI : ID = rad. : tan. DCI, = 1 : tan. DCI, = 1 : cotan. b. Therefore we have finally 1 : cotan. b = A': B': tan. $x$, and A': cotan. b = B': tan. $x$, and tan. $x$ = $\\frac{A}{B}$ cot. b. This equation evidently affords the mutual relation between the trim of the sails and the leeway in every case where we can tell the proportion between the resistances to the direct and broadside motions of the ship, and where this proportion does not change by the obliquity of the course. Thus, suppose the yard braced up at an angle of 35° with the keel. Then cotan. 35° = 1.732 very nearly. Suppose also that the resistance sidewise is 12 times greater than the resistance headwise. This gives\n\n\\[ A' = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B' = 12. \\]\n\nTherefore $1.732 = 12 \\times \\text{tangent}^2 x$, and $\\text{tangent}^2 x = \\frac{1.732}{12} = 0.14434$, and tan. $x = 0.3799$, and $x = 20^\\circ 48'$, very nearly two points of leeway.\n\nThis computation, or rather the equation which gives room for it, supposes the resistances proportional to the squares of the fines of incidence. The experiments of the Academy of Paris, of which an abstract is given in the article Resistance of Fluids, show that this supposition is not far from the truth when the angle of incidence is great. In the present case the angle of incidence on the front FG is about 70°, and the experiments just now mentioned show that the real resistances exceed the theoretical ones only $\\frac{1}{5}$. But the angle of incidence on EF is only 25° 48'. Experiment shows that in this inclination the resistance is almost quadruple of the theoretical resistances. Therefore the lateral resistance is assumed much too small in the present instance. Therefore a much smaller leeway will suffice for producing a lateral resistance which will balance the lateral impulse CK, arising from the obliquity of the sail, viz. 30°. The matter of fact is, that a pretty good sailing ship, with her sails braced to this angle at a medium, will not make above five or six degrees leeway in smooth water and easy weather; and yet in this situation the hull and rigging present a very great surface to the wind, in the most improper positions, so as to have a very great effect in increasing her leeway. And if we compute the resistances for this leeway of five degrees by the actual experiments of the French Academy on the angle, we shall find the result not far from the truth; that is, the direct and lateral resistances will be nearly in the proportion of CI to ID.\n\nIt results from this view of the matter, that the leeway is in general much smaller than what the usual theory affirms.\n\nWe also see, that according to whatever law the resistances change by a change of inclination, the leeway depends on the direction of the impulse of the wind; and this depends solely on the position of the sails with respect to the keel, whatever may be the direction of the wind. This is a very important observation, and will be frequently referred to in the progress of the present investigation. Note, however, that we are here considering only the action on the sails, and on the same sails. We are not considering the action of the wind on the hull and rigging. This may be very considerable; and it is always in a lee direction, and augments the leeway; and its influence must be to much the more sensible as it bears a greater proportion to the impulse on the sails. A ship under courses, or close-reefed topsails and courses, must make more leeway than when under all her canvas trimmed, to the same angle. But to introduce this additional cause of deviation here would render the investigation too complicated to be of any use.\n\nThis doctrine will be considerably illustrated by attending to the manner in which a lighter is tracked along a canal, or swung to its anchor in a stream. The time by track rope is made fast to some staple or bolt E on the deck (fig. 2.), and is passed between two of the timberheads of the bow D, and laid hold of at F on shore. The men or cattle walk along the path FG, the rope keeps...\nkeeps extended in the directions DF, and the lighter arranges itself in an oblique position AB, and is thus dragged along in the direction ab, parallel to the side of the canal. Or, if the canal has a current in the opposite direction ba, the lighter may be kept steady in its place by the rope DF made fast to a post at F. In this case, it is always observed, that the lighter swings in a position AB, which is oblique to the stream ab. Now the force which retains it in this position, and which precisely balances the action of the stream, is certainly exerted in the direction DF; and the lighter would be held in the same manner if the rope were made fast at C amidship, without any dependence on the timberheads at D; and it would be held in the same position, if instead of the single rope CF, it were riding by two ropes CG and CH, of which CH is in a direction right ahead, but oblique to the stream, and the other CG is perpendicular to CH or AB. And, drawing DI and DK perpendicular to AB and CG, the strain on the rope CII is to that on the rope CG as CI to CK. The action of the rope in these cases is precisely analogous to that of the sail y Y; and the obliquity of the keel to the direction of the motion, or to the direction of the stream, is analogous to the leeway. All this must be evident to anyone accustomed to mechanical dispositions.\n\nA most important use may be made of this illustration. If an accurate model be made of a ship, and if it be placed in a stream of water, and ridden in this manner by a rope made fast at any point D of the bow, it will arrange itself in some determined position AB. There will be a certain obliquity to the stream, measured by the angle Bo b; and there will be a corresponding obliquity of the rope, measured by the angle FCB. Let y CY be perpendicular to CF. Then CY will be the position of the yard, or trim of the sails corresponding to the leeway b CB. Then, if we shift the rope to a point of the bow distant from D by a small quantity, we shall obtain a new position of the ship, both with respect to the stream and rope; and in this way may be obtained the relation between the position of the sails and the leeway, independent of all theory, and susceptible of great accuracy; and this may be done with a variety of models suited to the most usual forms of ships.\n\nIn farther thinking on this subject, we are persuaded that these experiments, instead of being made on models, may with equal ease be made on a ship of any size. Let the ship ride in a stream at a mooring D (fig. 3.) by means of a float hawser BCD from her bow, having a spring AC on it carried out from her quarter. She will swing to her moorings, till she ranges herself in a certain position AB with respect to the direction ab of the stream; and the direction of the hawser DC will point to some point E of the line of the keel. Now, it is plain to anyone acquainted with mechanical dispositions, that the deviation BE b is precisely the leeway that the ship will make when the average position of the sails is that of the line GEH perpendicular to ED; at least this will give the leeway which is produced by the sails alone. By heaving on the spring, the knot C may be brought into any other position we please; and for every new position of the knot the ship will take a new position with respect to the stream and to the hawser. And we persist in saying, that more information will be got by this train of experiments than from any mathematical theory: for all the theories of the impulses of fluids must proceed on physical postulates with respect to the motions of the filaments, which are exceedingly conjectural.\n\nAnd it must now be farther observed, that the subdivision which we have made of an oblong parallelopiped for a ship, although well fitted to give us clear notions of the subject, is of small use in practice: for it is body next to impossible (even granting the theory of oblique only useful) to make this subdivision. A ship is of a form which is not reducible to equations; and therefore on the action of the water on her bow or broadside can only be had by a most laborious and intricate calculation for almost every square foot of its surface. (See Beszout's Cours de Mathemat. vol. v. p. 72, &c.) And this must be different for every ship. But, which is more unlucky, when we have got a parallelopiped which will have the same proportion of direct and lateral resistance for a particular angle of leeway, it will not answer for another leeway of the same ship; for when the leeway changes, the figure actually exposed to the action of the water changes also. When the leeway is increased, more of the lee-quarter is acted on by the water, and a part of the weather-bow is now removed from its action. Another parallelopiped must therefore be discovered, whose resistances shall suit this new position of the keel with respect to the real course of the ship.\n\nWe therefore beg leave to recommend this train of experiments to the notice of the Association for the Improvement of Naval Architecture as a very promising method for ascertaining this important point. And we proceed, in the next place, to ascertain the relation between the velocity of the ship and that of the wind, modified as they may be by the trim of the sails and the obliquity of the impulse.\n\nLet AB (figs. 4, 5, and 6.) represent the horizontal position of a ship. In place of all the drawing falls, that is, the falls which are really filled, we can always substitute one fall of equal extent, trimmed to the same angle the ship with the keel. This being supposed attached to the wind yard DCD, let this yard be first of all at right angles astern to the keel, as represented in fig. 4. Let the wind blow in the direction WC, and let CE (in the direction WC continued) represent the velocity V of the wind. Let CF be the velocity v of the ship. It must also be in the direction of the ship's motion, because when the sail is at right angles to the keel, the absolute impulse on the sail is in the direction of the keel, and there is no lateral impulse, and consequently no leeway. Draw EF, and complete the parallelogram CFEe, producing eC through the centre of the yard to w. Then w C will be the relative or apparent direction of the wind, and Ce or FE will be its apparent or relative velocity: For if the line Ce be carried along CF, keeping always parallel to its first position, and if a particle of air move uniformly along CE (a fixed line in absolute space) in the same time, this particle will always be found in that point of CE where is is intersected at that instant by the moving line C; so that if Ce were a tube, the particle of air, which really moves in the line CE, would always be found in the tube Ce. While Ce is the real direction of the wind, Ce will be the position of the\nvane at the mast head, which will therefore mark the apparent direction of the wind, or its motion relative to the moving ship.\n\nWe may conceive this in another way. Suppose a cannon-shot fired in the direction CE at the passing ship, and that it passes through the mast at C with the velocity of the wind. It will not pass through the off-side of the ship at P, in the line CE; for while the shot moves from C to P, the point P has gone forward, and the point P is now in the place where P was when the shot passed through the mast. The shot will therefore pass through the ship's side in the point P, and a person on board seeing it pass through C and P will say that its motion was in the line CP.\n\nThus it happens, that when a ship is in motion the apparent direction of the wind is always ahead of its real direction. The line WC is always found within the angle WCB. It is easy to see from the construction, that the difference between the real and apparent directions of the wind is much the more remarkable as the velocity of the ship is greater: For the angle WCE depends on the magnitude of E or CF, in proportion to CE. Persons not much accustomed to attend to these matters are apt to think all attention to this difference to be nothing but affectation of nicety. They have no notion that the velocity of a ship can have any sensible proportion to that of the wind. \"Swift as the wind\" is a proverbial expression; yet the velocity of a ship always bears a very sensible proportion to that of the wind, and even very frequently exceeds it. We may form a pretty exact notion of the velocity of the wind by observing the shadows of the summer clouds flying along the face of a country, and it may be very well measured by this method. The motion of such clouds cannot be very different from that of the air below; and when the pressure of the wind on a flat surface, while blowing with a velocity measured in this way, is compared with its pressure when its velocity is measured by more unexceptionable methods, they are found to agree with all desirable accuracy. Now observations of this kind frequently repeated, show that what we call a pleasant brisk gale blows at the rate of about 10 miles an hour, or about 15 feet in a second, and exerts a pressure of half a pound on a square foot. Mr Smeaton has frequently observed the sails of a windmill, driven by such a wind, moving faster, nay much faster, towards their extremities, so that the sail, instead of being pressed to the frames on the arms, was taken aback, and fluttering on them. Nay, we know that a good ship, with all her sails set and the wind on the beam, will in such a situation sail above ten knots an hour in smooth water. There is an observation made by every experienced seaman, which shows this difference between the real and apparent directions of the wind very distinctly. When a ship that is sailing briskly with the wind on the beam tacks about, and then sails equally well on the other tack, the wind always appears to have shifted and come more ahead. This is familiar to all seamen. The seaman judges of the direction of the wind by the position of the ship's vanes. Suppose the ship sailing due west on the starboard tack, with the wind apparently N. N. W., the vane pointing S. S. E. If the ship put about, and stands the reef on the larboard tack, the vane will be found no longer to point S. S. E. but perhaps S. S. W., the wind appearing N. N. E., and the ship must be nearly close-hauled in order to make an easterly course. The wind appears to have shifted four points. If the ship tacks again, the wind returns to its old quarter. We have often observed a greater difference than this. The celebrated astronomer Dr Bradley, taking the amusement of sailing in a pinnace on the river Thames, observed Bradley on this, and was surprised at it, imagining that the change this subject of wind was owing to the approaching to or retiring from the shore. The boatmen told him that it always happened at sea, and explained it to him in the best manner they were able. The explanation struck him, and set him a musing on an astronomical phenomenon which he had been puzzled by for some years, and which he called the aberration of the fixed stars. Every star changes its place a small matter for half a year, and returns to it at the completion of the year. He compared the streams of light from the star to the wind, and the telescope of the astronomer to the ship's vane, while the earth was like the ship, moving in opposite directions when in the opposite points of its orbit. The telescope must always be pointed ahead of the real direction of the star, in the same manner as the vane is always in a direction ahead of the wind; and thus he ascertained the progressive motion of light, and discovered the proportion of its velocity to the velocity of the earth in its orbit, by observing the deviation which was necessarily given to the telescope. Observing that the light shifted its direction about 40\", he concluded its velocity to be about 11,000 times greater than that of the earth; just as the intelligent seaman would conclude from this apparent shifting of the wind, that the velocity of the wind is about triple that of the ship. This is indeed the best method for discovering the velocity of the wind. Let the direction of the vane at the mast-head be very accurately noticed on both tacks, and let the velocity of the ship be also accurately measured. The angle between the directions of the ship's head on these different tacks being halved, will give the real direction of the wind, which must be compared with the position of the vane in order to determine the angle contained between the real and apparent directions of the wind or the angle ECE; or half of the observed shifting of the wind will show the inclination of its true and apparent directions. This being found, the proportion of EC to FC (fig. 6.) is easily measured.\n\nWe have been very particular on this point, because since the mutual actions of bodies depend on their relative motions only, we should make prodigious mistakes if we estimated the action of the wind by its real direction and velocity, when they differ so much from the relative or apparent.\n\nWe now resume the investigation of the velocity of the ship (fig. 4.), having its sails at right angles to the keel, and the wind blowing in the direction and with the velocity CE, while the ship proceeds in the direction of the keel with the velocity CF. Produce EE, angle to which is parallel to BC, till it meet the yard in g, and draw FG perpendicular to EG. Let a represent the angle WCD, contained between the sail and the real direction of the wind, and let b be the angle of trim DCB. CE the velocity of the wind was expressed by V, and CF the velocity of the ship by v.\n\nThe absolute impulse on the sail is (by the usual theory\ntheory) proportional to the square of the relative velocity, and to the square of the fine of the angle of incidence; that is, to $FE^2 \\times \\text{fin.}^2$ w CD. Now the angle GFE = w CD, and EG is equal to FE $\\times$ fin. GFE; and EG is equal to $EG - gG$. But $EG = EC \\times \\text{fin.}$. ECg, $= V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a; and $gG = CF$, $= v$. Therefore $EG = V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v$, and the impulse is proportional to $V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v^2$. If S represent the surface of the sail, the impulse, in pounds, will be $nS(V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v^2)$.\n\nLet A be the surface which, when it meets the water perpendicularly with the velocity $v$, will sustain the same pressure or resistance which the bows of the ship actually meets with. This impulse, in pounds, will be $mAv^2$. Therefore, because we are considering the ship's motion as in a state of uniformity, the two pressures balance each other; and therefore $mAv^2 = nS(V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v^2)$, and $\\frac{m}{n}A = S(V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v^2)$;\n\ntherefore $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A \\times v = \\sqrt{S} \\times V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v\\sqrt{S}$, and\n\n$v = \\frac{\\sqrt{S} \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + \\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + \\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + \\sqrt{S}} + 1.$\n\nWe see, in the first place, that the velocity of the ship is (ceteris paribus) proportional to the velocity of the wind, and to the fine of its incidence on the sail jointly; for while the surface of the sail S and the equivalent surface for the bow remains the same, $v$ increases or diminishes at the rate same with $V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v$. When the wind is right aft, the fine of $a$ is unity,\n\nand then the ship's velocity is $\\frac{V}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + \\sqrt{S}} + 1.$\n\nNote, that the denominator of this fraction is a common number; for $m$ and $n$ are numbers, and $A$ and $S$ being quantities of one kind, $\\frac{A}{S}$ is also a number.\n\nIt must also be carefully attended to, that $S$ expresses a quantity of sail actually receiving wind with the inclination $a$. It will not always be true, therefore, that the velocity will increase as the wind is more abaft, because some sails will then be less effective. This observation is not, however, of great importance; for it is very unusual to put a ship in the situation considered hitherto; that is, with the yards square, unless she be right before the wind.\n\nIf we would discover the relation between the velocity and the quantity of sail in this simple case of the wind right aft, observe that the equation $v = \\frac{V}{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + \\sqrt{S}} + 1.$ gives us $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A + v = V$, and $\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{n}}A = V - v$, and $\\frac{m}{n}A = V - v^2$, and $\\frac{n}{m}A = \\frac{v^2}{(V-v)^2}$; and because $n$ and $m$ and $A$ are constant quantities, $S$ is proportional to $\\frac{v^2}{(V-v)^2}$, or the surface of sail is proportional to the square of the ship's velocity directly, and to the square of the relative velocity inversely. Thus, if a ship be sailing with one-eighth of the velocity of the wind, and we would have her sail with one-fourth of it, we must quadruple the sail. This is more easily seen in another way. The velocity of the ship is proportional to the velocity of the wind; and therefore the relative velocity is also proportional to that of the wind, and the impulse of the wind is as the square of the relative velocity. Therefore, in order to increase the relative velocity by an increase of sail only, we must make this increase of sail in the duplicate proportion of the increase of velocity.\n\nLet us, in the next place, consider the motion of a ship whose sails stand oblique to the keel.\n\nThe construction for this purpose differs a little from the former, because, when the sails are trimmed to any other position DCB (fig. 5, and 6.), there must be a deviation from the direction of the keel, or a leeway to the keel BC b. Call this $x$. Let CF be the velocity of the ship, fig. 5, and FG perpendicular to EG; also draw FH perpendicular to the yard; then, as before, EG, which is in the subductive ratio of the impulse on the sail, is equal to $EG - GG$. Now $EG$ is, as before, $= V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a, and $GG$ is equal to FH, which is $= CF \\times \\text{fin.}$. FCH, or $= v \\times \\text{fin.}$. ($b+x$). Therefore we have the impulse $= nS(V \\times \\text{fin.}$. a$-v \\times \\text{fin.}$. ($b+x$)$^2$.\n\nThis expression of the impulse is perfectly similar to that in the former case, its only difference consisting in the subductive part, which is here $v \\times \\text{fin.}$. ($b+x$) instead of $v$. But it expresses the same thing as before, viz. the diminution of the impulse. The impulse being reckoned solely in the direction perpendicular to the sail, it is diminished solely by the sail withdrawing itself in that direction from the wind; and as $GE$ may be considered as the real impulsive motion of the wind, $GE$ must be considered as the relative and effective impulsive motion. The impulse would have been the same had the ship been at rest, and had the wind met it perpendicularly with the velocity $GE$.\n\nWe must now show the connection between this impulse and the motion of the ship. The sail, and consequently the ship, is pressed by the wind in the direction CI perpendicular to the sail or yard with the force impulse which we have just now determined. This (in the state of the ship of uniform motion) must be equal and opposite to the action of the water. Draw IL at right angles to the keel. The impulse in the direction CI (which we may measure by CI) is equivalent to the impulses CL and LI. By the first the ship is impelled forward, and by the second she is driven sidewise. Therefore we must have a leeway, and a lateral as well as a direct resistance. We suppose the form of the ship to be known, and therefore the proportion is known, or discoverable, between the direct and lateral resistances corresponding to every angle $x$ of leeway. Let A be the surface whose perpendicular resistance is equal to the direct resistance of the ship corresponding to the leeway $x$, that is, whose resistance is equal to the resistance really felt by the ship's bows in the direction of the keel when she is sailing with this leeway; and let B in like manner be the surface whose perpendicular resistance is equal to the actual resistance to the ship's motion in the direction LI, perpendicular to the keel. (N.B. This is not equivalent to A and B' adapted to the rectangular box, but to A' col. $x$ and B' fin. $x$.) We have therefore\ntherefore \\( A : B = CL : LI \\), and \\( LI = \\frac{CL \\cdot B}{A} \\). Also, because \\( CI = \\sqrt{CL^2 + IP^2} \\), we have \\( A : \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = CL : CI \\), and \\( CI = \\frac{CL \\cdot \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}{A} \\). The resistance in the direction LC is properly measured by \\( m \\cdot A \\cdot v^2 \\), as has been already observed. Therefore the resistance in the direction IC must be expressed by \\( m \\cdot \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\cdot v^2 \\); or (making C the surface which is equal to \\( \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\)), and which will therefore have the same perpendicular resistance to the water having the velocity \\( v \\) it may be expressed by \\( m \\cdot C \\cdot v^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, because there is an equilibrium between the impulse and resistance, we have \\( m \\cdot A \\cdot v^2 = n \\cdot S \\cdot (\\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a - v \\cdot \\sin b + x)^2 \\) and \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\cdot C \\cdot v^2 = q \\cdot C \\cdot v^2 = S \\cdot (\\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a - v \\cdot \\sin b + x)^2 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} \\cdot v = \\sqrt{S} \\cdot (\\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a - v \\cdot \\sin b + x) \\).\n\nTherefore \\( v = \\frac{\\sqrt{S} \\cdot \\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a}{\\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} + \\sqrt{S} \\cdot \\sin b + x} = \\frac{\\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a}{\\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} + \\sin b + x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{S} \\cdot \\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a}{\\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} + \\sin b + x} \\).\n\nObserve that the quantity which is the coefficient of V in this equation is a common number; for \\( \\sin a \\) is a number, being a decimal fraction of the radius 1, \\( \\sin b + x \\) is also a number, for the same reason. And since \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) were numbers of pounds, \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\) or \\( q \\) is a common number. And because C and S are surfaces, or quantities of one kind, \\( \\frac{C}{S} \\) is also a common number.\n\nThis is the simplest expression that we can think of for the velocity acquired by the ship, though it must be acknowledged to be too complex to be of very prompt use. Its complication arises from the necessity of introducing the leeway \\( x \\). This affects the whole of the denominator; for the surface C depends on it, because \\( C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\), and A and B are analogous to \\( A' \\cdot \\cotan b \\cdot x \\) and \\( B' \\cdot \\sin b \\cdot x \\).\n\nBut we can deduce some important consequences from this theorem.\n\nWhile the surface S of the sail actually filled by the wind remains the same, and the angle DCB, which in future we shall call the trim of the sails, also remains the same, both the leeway \\( x \\) and the substituted surface C remains the same. The denominator is therefore constant; and the velocity of the ship is proportional to \\( \\sqrt{S} \\cdot \\text{V} \\cdot \\sin a \\); that is, directly as the velocity of the wind, directly as the absolute inclination of the wind to the yard, and directly as the square root of the surface of the sails.\n\nWe also learn from the construction of the figure that FG parallel to the yard cuts CE in a given ratio. For CF is in a constant ratio to EG, as has been just now demonstrated. And the angle DCF is constant. Therefore \\( CF \\cdot \\sin b \\), or FH or \\( G \\cdot \\sin b \\), is proportional to EG, and OC to EC, or EC is cut in one proportion, whatever may be the angle ECD, so long as the angle DCF is constant.\n\nWe also see that it is very possible for the velocity of the ship on an oblique course to exceed that of the wind. This will be the case when the number\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin a}{\\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} + \\sin b + x}\n\\]\n\nexceeds unity, or when \\( \\sin a \\) is greater than \\( \\sqrt{q} \\cdot \\sqrt{C} + \\sin b + x \\). Now this may easily be by sufficiently enlarging \\( S \\) and diminishing \\( b + x \\). It is indeed frequently seen in fine sailors with all their sails set and not hauled too near the wind.\n\nWe remarked above that the angle of leeway \\( x \\) affects the whole denominator of the fraction which expresses the velocity. Let it be observed that the angle JCL is the complement of LCD, or of \\( b \\). Therefore, \\( CL : LI \\), or \\( A : B = 1 : \\tan ICL \\), \\( ICL = 1 : \\cotan b \\), \\( B = A' \\cdot \\cotan b \\). Now A is equivalent to \\( A' \\cdot \\cotan b \\cdot x \\), and thus \\( b \\) becomes a function of \\( x \\). C is evidently fo, being \\( \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \\). Therefore before the value of this fraction can be obtained, we must be able to compute, by our knowledge of the form of the ship, the value of A for every angle \\( x \\) of leeway. This can be done only by resolving her bows into a great number of elementary planes, and computing the impulses on each and adding them into one sum. The computation is of immense labour, as may be seen by one example given by Bouguer. When the leeway is but small, not exceeding ten degrees, the substitution of the rectangular prism of one determined form is abundantly exact for all leeways contained within this limit; and we shall soon feel reason for being contented with this approximation. We may now make use of the formula expressing the velocity for solving the chief problems in this part of the seaman's task.\n\nAnd first let it be required to determine the best position of the sail for standing on a given course \\( ab \\), when to determine the direction and velocity of the wind, and its angle with the course WCF, are given. This problem has been often exercised the talents of the mathematicians ever since the days of Newton. In the article Pneumatics we found the solution of one very nearly related to it, namely, on a given course, to determine the position of the sail which would produce the greatest impulse in the direction of the course. The solution was to place the yard CD in such a position that the tangent of the angle FCD may be half of the one half of the tangent of the angle DCW. This will indeed be the best position of the sail for beginning the motion; but as soon as the ship begins to move in the course are direction CF, the effective impulse of the wind is diminished, and also its inclination to the sail. The angle DCW diminishes continually as the ship accelerates; for CF is now accompanied by its equal \\( E \\), and by an angle EC \\( e \\) or WC \\( w \\). CF increases, and the impulse on the sail diminishes, till an equilibrium obtains between the resistance of the water and the impulse of the wind. The impulse is now measured by \\( CE \\times \\sin a \\cdot e \\cdot CD \\) instead of \\( CE \\times \\sin a \\cdot ECD \\), that is, by \\( EG \\times \\sin a \\cdot E \\).\n\nThis introduction of the relative motion of the wind renders the actual solution of the problem extremely difficult.\ndifficult. It is very easily expressed geometrically: Divide the angle \\( \\omega CF \\) in such a manner that the tangent of DCF may be half of the tangent of DC \\( \\omega \\), and the problem may be constructed geometrically as follows.\n\nLet WCF (fig. 7.) be the angle between the sail and course. Round the centre C describe the circle WDFY; produce WC to Q, so that CO = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) WC, and draw QY parallel to CF cutting the circle in Y; bisect the arch WY in D, and draw DC. DC is the proper position of the yard.\n\nDraw the chord WY, cutting CD in V and CF in T; draw the tangent PD cutting CF in S and CY in R.\n\nIt is evident that WY, PR, are both perpendicular to CD, and are bisected in V and D; therefore (by reason of the parallels QY, CF) \\( 4 : 3 = QW : CW \\), \\( = YW : TW, = RP : SP \\). Therefore PD : PS = 2 : 3, and PD : DS = 2 : 1. Q.E.D.\n\nBut this division cannot be made to the best advantage till the ship has attained its greatest velocity, and the angle \\( \\omega CF \\) has been produced.\n\nWe must consider all the three angles, \\( a, b, \\) and \\( x \\), as variable in the equation which expresses the value of \\( v \\), and we must make the fluxion of this equation \\( = 0 \\); then, by means of the equation \\( B = A \\cdot \\cotan b \\), we must obtain the value of \\( b \\) and of \\( \\dot{b} \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( \\dot{x} \\).\n\nWith respect to \\( a \\), observe, that if we make the angle WCF = \\( \\rho \\), we have \\( \\rho = a + b + x \\); and \\( \\rho \\) being a constant quantity, we have \\( a + b + x = 0 \\). Substituting for \\( a, b, \\dot{a}, \\dot{b} \\), their values in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( \\dot{x} \\), in the trigonometrical equation \\( = 0 \\), we readily obtain \\( x \\), and then \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), which solves the problem.\n\nLet it be required, in the next place, to determine the course and trim of the sails most proper for plying to windward.\n\nIn fig. 6. draw FP perpendicular to WC. CF is the motion of the ship; but it is only by the motion PC that she gains to windward. Now CP is \\( = CF \\times \\text{cofin}.(a + b + x) \\). This must be rendered a maximum, as follows.\n\nBy means of the equation which expresses the value of \\( v \\) and the equation \\( B = A \\cdot \\cotan b \\), we exterminate the quantities \\( v \\) and \\( b \\); we then take the fluxion of the quantity into which the expression \\( v \\cdot \\text{cofin}.(a + b + x) \\) is changed by this operation. Making this fluxion \\( = 0 \\), we get the equation which must solve the problem. This equation will contain the two variable quantities \\( a \\) and \\( x \\) with their fluxions; then make the coefficient of \\( \\dot{x} \\) equal to \\( v \\), also the coefficient of \\( \\dot{a} \\) equal to \\( v \\). This will give two equations which will determine \\( a \\) and \\( x \\), and from this we get \\( b = \\rho - a - x \\).\n\nShould it be required, in the third place, to find the best course and trim of the sails for getting away from a given line of coast CM (fig. 6.), the process perfectly resembles this last, which is in fact getting away from the sails for a line of coast which makes a right angle with the wind. Therefore, in place of the angle WCF, we must substitute the angle WCM \\( = \\pm WCF \\). Call this angle \\( e \\). We must make \\( v \\cdot \\text{cofin}.(e - a - b - x) \\) a maximum. The analytical process is the same as the former, only \\( e \\) is here a constant quantity.\n\nThese are the three principal problems which can be solved by means of the knowledge that we have obtained of the motion of the ship when impelled by an oblique sail, and therefore making leeway; and they may be considered as an abstract of this part of M. Bouguer's work. We have only pointed out the process for this solution, and have even omitted some things taken notice of by M. Bezout in his very elegant compendium. Our reasons will appear as we go on. The learned reader will readily see the extreme difficulty of the subject, and the immense calculations which are necessary even in the simplest cases, and will grant that it is out of the power of any but an expert analyst to derive any use from them; but the mathematician can calculate tables for the use of the practical seaman. Thus he can calculate the best position of the sails for advancing in a course \\( 90^\\circ \\) from the wind, and the velocity in that course; then for \\( 85^\\circ, 80^\\circ, 75^\\circ \\), &c. M. Bouguer has given a table of this kind; but to avoid the immense difficulty of the process, he has adapted it to the apparent direction of the wind. We have inferred a few of his numbers, suited to such cases as can be of service, namely, the sails for when all the sails draw, or none stand in the way of advancing others. Column 1st is the apparent angle of the wind in any course; column 2nd is the corresponding angle of the sails and keel; and column 3rd is the apparent angle of the sails and wind.\n\n| \\( \\omega CF \\) | DCB | \\( \\omega CD \\) |\n|-------------|-----|-------------|\n| 103° 53'    | 42° 30' | 61° 23' |\n| 99° 13'     | 40°   | 59° 13'    |\n| 94° 25'     | 37° 30' | 56° 55'    |\n| 89° 28'     | 35°   | 54° 28'    |\n| 84° 23'     | 32° 30' | 51° 53'    |\n| 79° 66'     | 30°   | 49° 06'    |\n| 73° 39'     | 27° 30' | 46° 09'    |\n| 68°         | 25°   | 43°        |\n\nIn all these numbers we have the tangent of \\( \\omega CD \\) double of the tangent of DCF.\n\nBut this is really doing but little for the seaman. Intuitively the apparent direction of the wind is unknown to him till the ship is sailing with uniform velocity; and he is still uninformed as to the leeway. It is, however, of service to him to know, for instance, that when the angle of the vanes and yards is 56 degrees, the yard should be braced up to 37° 30', &c.\n\nBut here occurs a new difficulty. By the construction of a square-rigged ship it is impossible to give the yards that inclination to the keel which the calculation requires. Few ships can have their yards braced up to 37° 30'; and yet this is required in order to have an incidence of 56°, and to hold a course 94° 25' from the apparent direction of the wind, that is, with the wind apparently 4° 25' abaft the beam. A good sailing ship in this position may acquire a velocity even exceeding that of the wind. Let us suppose it only one half of this velocity. We shall find that the angle WC \\( \\omega \\) is in this case about 29°, and the ship is nearly going 123° from the wind, with the wind almost perpendicular to the sail; therefore this utmost bracing up of the sails is only giving them the position suited to a wind broad on the quarter. It is impossible therefore to comply with the demand of the mathematician, and the seaman must be contented to employ a less favourable disposition of his sails in all cases where his course does not lie at least eleven points from the wind.\nLet us see whether this restriction, arising from necessity, leaves anything in our choice, and makes one course preferable to another. We see that there are a prodigious number of courses, and these the most usual and the most important, which we must hold with one trim of the sails; in particular, failing with the wind on the beam, and all cases of plying to windward, must be performed with this unfavourable trim of the sails. We are certain that the smaller we make the angle of incidence, real or apparent, the smaller will be the velocity of the ship; but it may happen that we shall gain more to windward, or get sooner away from a lee-coast, or any object of danger, by failing slowly on one course than by failing quickly on another.\n\nWe have seen that while the trim of the sails remains the same, the leeway and the angle of the yard and course remains the same, and that the velocity of the ship is as the sine of the angle of real incidence, that is, as the sine of the angle of the sail and the real direction of the wind.\n\nLet the ship AB (fig. 8.) hold the course CF, with the wind blowing in the direction WC, and having her yards DCD braced up to the smallest angle BCD which the rigging can admit. Let CF be to CE as the velocity of the ship to the velocity of the wind; join FE and draw Cw parallel to EF; it is evident that FE is the relative motion of the wind, and w CD is the relative incidence on the sail. Draw FO parallel to the yard DC, and describe a circle through the points COF; then we say that if the ship, with the same wind and the same trim of the same drawing sails, be made to fail on any other course Cf, her velocity along CF is to the velocity along Cf as CF is to Cf; or, in other words, the ship will employ the same time in going from C to any point of the circumference CFO.\n\nJoin fO. Then, because the angles CFO, cFO are on the same chord CO, they are equal, and fO is parallel to dC, the new position of the yard corresponding to the new position of the keel ab, making the angle dCB=DCB. Also, by the nature of the circle, the line CF is to Cf as the sine of the angle CFO to the sine of the angle COf, that is (on account of the parallels CD, OF and Cd, Of), as the sine of WCD to the sine of WCD. But when the trim of the sails remains the same, the velocity of the ship is as the sine of the angle of the sail with the direction of the wind; therefore CF is to Cf as the velocity on CF to that on Cf, and the proposition is demonstrated.\n\nLet it now be required to determine the best course for avoiding a rock R lying in the direction CR, or for withdrawing as fast as possible from a line of coast PQ. Draw CM through R, or parallel to PQ, and let m be the middle of the arch CmM. It is plain that m is the most remote from CM of any point of the arch CmM, and therefore the ship will recede farther from the coast PQ in any given time by holding the course Cm than by any other course.\n\nThis course is easily determined; for the arch CmM =360° - (arch CO + arch OM), and the arch CO is the measure of twice the angle CFO, or twice the angle DCB, or twice b+x, and the arch OM measures twice the angle ECM.\n\nThus suppose the sharpest possible trim of the sails to be 35°, and the observed angle ECM to be 70°; then CO+OM is 70°+140° or 210°. This being taken from 360°, leaves 150°, of which the half Mm is 75°, and the angle MCm is 37° 30'. This added to ECM makes ECM 107° 30', leaving WCm=72° 30', and the ship must hold a course making an angle of 72° 30' with the real direction of the wind, and WCD will be 37° 30'.\n\nThis supposes no leeway. But if we know that under all the fail which the ship can carry with safety and advantage she makes 5 degrees of leeway, the angle DCm of the fail and course, or b+x, is 40°. Then CO+OM=220°, which being taken from 360° leaves 140°, of which the half is 70°, =Mm, and the angle MCm =35°, and ECM=105°, and WCm=75°, and the ship must lie with her head 70° from the wind, making 5 degrees of leeway, and the angle WCD is 35°.\n\nThe general rule for the position of the ship is, that the line on shipboard which bisects the angle b+x may also bisect the angle WCM, or make the angle between the course and the line from which we wish to withdraw equal to the angle between the fail and the real direction of the wind.\n\nIt is plain that this problem includes that of plying to windward. We have only to suppose ECM to be 90°; then, taking our example in the same ship, with the same trim and the same leeway, we have b+x=40°. This taken from 90° leaves 50° and WCm=90°-25=65°, and the ship's head must lie 65° from the wind, and the yard must be 25° from it.\n\nIt must be observed here, that it is not always eligible to select the course which will remove the ship fastest from the given line CM; it may be more prudent to remove from it more securely though more slowly. In such cases the procedure is very simple, viz. to shape the course as near the wind as is possible.\n\nThe reader will also easily see that the propriety of these practices is confined to those courses only where the practicable trim of the sails is not sufficiently sharp. Whenever the course lies so far from the wind that it is impossible to make the tangent of the apparent angle of the wind and fail double the tangent of the fail and course, it should be done.\n\nThese are the chief practical consequences which can be deduced from the theory. But we should consider how far this adjustment of the sails and course can be performed. And here occur difficulties so great as to make it almost impracticable. We have always supposed the position of the surface of the fail to be distinctly observable and measurable; but this can hardly be affirmed even with respect to a fail stretched on a yard. Here we supposed the surface of the fail to have the same inclination to the keel that the yard has. This is by no means the case; the fail assumes a concave form, of which it is almost impossible to affirm the direction of the mean impulse. We believe that this is always considerably to leeward of a perpendicular to the yard, lying between CI and CE (fig. 6.). This is of some advantage, being equivalent to a sharper trim. We cannot affirm this, however, with any confidence, because it renders the impulse on the weather-leech of the fail so exceedingly feeble as hardly to have any effect. In failing close to the wind the ship is kept to near that the weather-leech of the fail is almost ready to receive the wind edgewife, and to flutter or shiver. The most effective or drawing fails with a side-wind, especially when\nwhen plying to windward, are the stayfails. We believe that it is impossible to say, with any thing approaching to precision, what is the position of the general surface of a stayfail, or to calculate the intensity and direction of the general impulse; and we affirm with confidence that no man can pronounce on these points with any exactness. If we can guess within a third or a fourth part of the truth, it is all we can pretend to; and after all, it is but a guess. Add to this, the fails coming in the way of each other, and either becalming them or sending the wind upon them in a direction widely different from that of its free motion. All these points we think beyond our power of calculation, and therefore that it is in vain to give the seaman mathematical rules, or even tables of adjustment ready calculated; since he can neither produce that medium position of his fails that is required, nor tell what is the position which he employs.\n\nThis is one of the principal reasons why so little advantage has been derived from the very ingenious and promising disquisitions of Bouguer and other mathematicians, and has made us omit the actual solution of the chief problems, contenting ourselves with pointing out the process to such readers as have a relish for these analytical operations.\n\nBut there is another principal reason for the small progress which has been made in the theory of seamanship: This is the error of the theory itself, which supposes the impulsions of a fluid to be in the duplicate ratio of the sine of incidence. The most careful comparison which has been made between the results of this theory and matter of fact is to be seen in the experiments made by the members of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, mentioned in the article RESISTANCE OF FLUIDS. We subjoin another abstract of them in the following table; where col. 1st gives the angle of incidence; col. 2nd gives the impulsions really observed; col. 3rd the impulsions had they followed the duplicate ratio of the sines; and col. 4th the impulsions, if they were in the simple ratio of the sines.\n\n| Angle | Impulsion Observed | Impulsion as Sine² | Impulsion as Sine |\n|-------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| 90    | 1000              | 1000               | 1000             |\n| 84    | 980               | 980                | 995              |\n| 78    | 958               | 957                | 978              |\n| 72    | 928               | 925                | 951              |\n| 66    | 845               | 835                | 914              |\n| 60    | 771               | 750                | 866              |\n| 54    | 693               | 655                | 809              |\n| 48    | 615               | 552                | 743              |\n| 42    | 543               | 448                | 660              |\n| 36    | 480               | 346                | 587              |\n| 30    | 440               | 250                | 500              |\n| 24    | 424               | 165                | 407              |\n| 18    | 414               | 96                 | 309              |\n| 12    | 406               | 43                 | 208              |\n| 6     | 400               | 11                 | 105              |\n\nHere we see an enormous difference in the great obliquities. When the angle of incidence is only six degrees, the observed impulse is forty times greater than the theoretical impulse; at 12° it is ten times greater; at 18° it is more than four times greater; and at 24° it is almost three times greater.\n\nNo wonder then that the deductions from this theory and the deductions from it are so unlike what we familiarly observe. We took notice of this when we were considering the leeway of a rectangular box, and thus saw a reason for admitting an incomparably smaller leeway than what would result from the laborious computations necessary by the theory. This error in theory has as great an influence on the impulsions of air when acting obliquely on a sail; and the experiments of Mr Robins and of the Chevalier Borda on the oblique impulsions of air are perfectly conformable (as far as they go) to those of the academicians on water. The oblique impulsions of the wind are therefore much more efficacious for preluding the ship in the direction of her course than the theory allows us to suppose; and the progress of a ship plying to windward is much greater, both because the oblique impulsions of the wind are more effective, and because the leeway is much smaller, than we suppose. Were not this the case, it would be impossible for a square-rigged ship to get to windward. The impulse on her sails when close hauled would be so trifling that she would not have a third part of the velocity which we see her acquire; and this trifling velocity would be wasted in leeway; for we have seen that the diminution of the oblique impulsions of the water is accompanied by an increase of leeway. But we see that in the great obliquities the impulsions continue to be very considerable, and that even an incidence of six degrees gives an impulse as great as the theory allows to an incidence of 40°. We may therefore, on all occasions, keep the yards more square; and the loss which we sustain by the diminution of the very oblique impulse will be more than compensated by its more favourable direction with respect to the ship's keel. Let us take an example of this. Suppose the wind about two points before the beam, making an angle of 68° with the keel. The theory affirms 43° for the inclination of the wind to the sail, and 15° for the trim of the sail. The perpendicular impulse being supposed 1000, the theoretical impulse for 45° is 465. This reduced in the proportion of radius to the fine of 25°, gives the impulse in the direction of the course only 197.\n\nBut if we ease off the lee-braces till the yard makes an angle of 50° with the keel, and allows the wind an incidence of no more than 18°, we have the experimented impulse 414, which, when reduced in the proportion of radius to the fine of 50°, gives an effective impulse 317°. In like manner, the trim 56°, with the incidence 12°, gives an effective impulse 337°; and the trim 62°, with the incidence only 6°, gives 353°.\n\nHence it would at first sight appear that the angle DCB of 62° and WCD of 6° would be better for holding a course within five points of the wind than any more oblique position of the sails; but it will only give a greater initial impulse. As the ship accelerates, the wind apparently comes ahead, and we must continue to brace up as the ship freethens her way. It is not unusual for her to acquire half or two thirds of the velocity of the wind; in which case the wind comes apparently ahead more than two points, when the yards must be braced up to 35°, and this allows an impulse no greater than about 7°. Now this is very frequently observed.\nobserved in good ships, which in a brisk gale and smooth water will go five or six knots close hauled, the ship's head six points from the wind, and the sails no more than just full, but ready to shiver by the smallest luff. All this would be impossible by the usual theory; and in this respect these experiments of the French academy gave a fine illustration of the seaman's practice. They account for what we should otherwise be much puzzled to explain; and the great progress which is made by a ship close hauled being perfectly agreeable to what we should expect from the law of oblique impulsion deducible from these so often mentioned experiments, while it is totally incompatible with the common theory, should make us abandon the theory without hesitation, and strenuously set about the establishment of another, founded entirely on experiments. For this purpose the experiments should be made on the oblique impulsions of air on as great a scale as possible, and in as great a variety of circumstances, so as to furnish a series of impulsions for all angles of obliquity. We have had four or five experiments on this subject, viz. two by Mr Robins and two or three by the Chevalier Borda. Having thus got a series of impulsions, it is very practicable to raise on this foundation a practical institute, and to give a table of the velocities of a ship suited to every angle of inclination and trim; for nothing is more certain than the resolution of the impulse perpendicular to the sail into a force in the direction of the keel, and a lateral force.\n\nWe are also disposed to think that experiments might be made on a model very nicely rigged with sails, and trimmed in every different degree, which would point out the mean direction of the impulse on the sails, and the comparative force of these impulses in different directions of the wind. The method would be very similar to that for examining the impulse of the water on the hull. If this can also be ascertained experimentally, the intelligent reader will easily see that the whole motion of a ship under sail may be determined for every case. Tables may then be constructed by calculation, or by graphical operations, which will give the velocities of a ship in every different course, and corresponding to every trim of sail. And let it be here observed, that the trim of the sail is not to be estimated in degrees of inclination of the yards; because, as we have already remarked, we cannot observe nor adjust the latter sails in this way. But, in making the experiments for ascertaining the impulse, the exact position of the tacks and sheets of the sails are to be noted; and this combination of adjustments is to pass by the name of a certain trim. Thus that trim of all the sails may be called 45°, whose direction is experimentally found equivalent to a flat surface trimmed to the obliquity 45°.\n\nHaving done this, we may construct a figure for each trim similar to fig. 8, where, instead of a circle, we shall have a curve COM'F', whose chords CF', CF', &c. are proportional to the velocities in these courses; and by means of this curve we can find the point m', which is most remote from any line CM from which we wish to withdraw; and thus we may solve all the principal problems of the art.\n\nWe hope that it will not be accounted presumption in us to expect more improvement from a theory founded on judicious experiments only, than from a theory of the impulse of fluids, which is found to incongruous with observation, and of whose fallacy all its authors, from Newton to D'Alembert, entertained strong suspicions. Again, we beg leave to recommend this view of the subject to the attention of the Society recommended for the Improvement of Naval Architecture, and to the Society Should these patriotic gentlemen entertain a favourable opinion of the plan, and honour us with their correspondence, we will cheerfully impart to them our naval notions of the way in which both these trains of experiments may be prosecuted with success, and results obtained in which we may confide; and we content ourselves at present with offering to the public these hints, which are not the speculations of a man of more science, but of one who, with a competent knowledge of the laws of mechanical nature, has the experience of several years service in the royal navy, where the art of working of ships was a favourite object of his scientific attention.\n\nWith these observations we conclude our discussion of Means employed to consider the means that are employed to prevent or produce any deviations from the uniform rectilinear course, which has been selected.\n\nHere the ship is to be considered as a body in free course, convertible round her centre of inertia. For whatever may be the point round which she turns, this motion may always be considered as compounded of a rotation round an axis passing through her centre of gravity or inertia. She is impelled by the wind and by the water acting on many surfaces differently inclined to each other, and the impulse on each is perpendicular to the surface. In order therefore that she may continue steadily in one course, it is not only necessary that the impelling forces, estimated in their mean direction, be equal and opposite to the resisting forces estimated in their mean direction; but also that these two directions may pass through one point, otherwise she will be affected as a log of wood is when pushed in opposite directions by two forces, which are equal indeed, but are applied to different parts of the log. A ship must be considered as a lever, acted on in different parts by forces in different directions, and the whole balancing each other round that point or axis where the equivalent of all the resisting forces passes. This may be considered as a point supported by this resisting force and as a sort of fulcrum; therefore, in order that the ship may maintain her position, the energies or momenta of all the impelling forces round this point must balance each other.\n\nWhen a ship sails right abreast the wind, with her yards square, it is evident that the impulses on each side of the ship's keel are equal, as also their mechanical momenta round sailing right any axis passing perpendicularly through the keel. So before the actions of the water on her bows. But when she enters from sails on an oblique course, with her yards braced up on those on either side, she sustains a prelude in the direction CM' when (fig. 5.) perpendicular to the sail. This, by giving her a lateral prelude LI, as well as a prelude CL ahead, causes her to make leeway, and to move in a line CB inclined to CB. By this means the balance of action on the two bows is destroyed; the general impulse on the lee-bow is increased; and that on the weather-bow is diminished.\nminished. The combined impulse is therefore no longer in the direction BC, but (in the state of uniform motion) in the direction IC.\n\nSuppose that in an instant the whole sails are annihilated and the impelling pressure CI, which precisely balanced the resisting pressure on the bows, removed. The ship tends, by her inertia, to proceed in the direction Cb. This tendency produces a continuation of the resistance in the opposite direction IC, which is not directly opposed to the tendency of the ship in the direction Cb; therefore the ship's head would immediately come up to the wind. The experienced seamen will recollect something like this when the sails are suddenly lowered when coming to anchor. It does not happen solely from the obliquity of the action on the bows; it would happen to the parallelepiped of fig. 2, which was sustaining a lateral impulse B·fin. x, and a direct impulse A·col. x. These are continued for a moment after the annihilation of the tail: but being no longer opposed by a force in the direction CD, but by a force in the direction Cb, the force B·fin. x must prevail, and the body is not only retarded in its motion, but its head turns towards the wind. But this effect of the leeway is greatly increased by the curved form of the ship's bows. This occasions the centre of effort of all the impulsions of the water on the lee side of the ship to be very far forward, and this so much the more remarkably as she is sharper afore. It is in general not much abaft the foremast. Now the centre of the ship's tendency to continue her motion is the same with her centre of gravity, and this is generally but a little before the mainmast. She is therefore in the same condition nearly as if she were pushed at the mainmast in a direction parallel to Cb, and at the foremast by a force parallel to IC. The evident consequence of this is a tendency to come up to the wind. This is independent of all situation of the sails, provided only that they have been trimmed obliquely.\n\nThis tendency of the ship's head to windward is called gripping in the seaman's language, and is greatest in ships which are sharp forward, as we have said already. This circumstance is easily understood. Whatever is the direction of the ship's motion, the absolute impulse on that part of the bow immediately contiguous to B is perpendicular to that very part of the surface. The more acute, therefore, that the angle of the bow is, the more will the impulse on that part be perpendicular to the keel, and the greater will be its energy to turn the head to windward.\n\nThus we are enabled to understand or to see the propriety of the disposition of the sails of a ship. We see her crowded with sails forward, and even many sails extended far before her bow, such as the spritail, the bowsprit-topmast, the fore-topmast stay-sail, the jib, and flying jib. The sails abaft are comparatively smaller. The sails on the mizzenmast are much smaller than those on the foremast. All the staysails hoisted on the mainmast may be considered as head sails, because their centres of effort are considerably before the centre of gravity of the ship; and notwithstanding this disposition, it generally requires a small action of the rudder to counteract the windward tendency of the lee-bow. This is considered as a good quality when moderate; because it enables the seaman to throw the sails aback, and stop the ship's way in a moment, if she be in danger from any thing ahead; and the ship which does not carry a little of a weather helm, is always a dull sailer.\n\nIn order to judge somewhat more accurately of the action of the water and sails, suppose the ship A.B the water (fig. 9.) to have its sails on the mizzenmast D, the mainmast E, and foremast F, braced up or trimmed alike, and that the three lines Di, Ee, Ff, perpendicular to the sails, are in the proportion of the impulses on the sails. The ship is driven ahead and to leeward, and moves in the path a.Cb. This path is so inclined to the line of the keel that the medium direction of the resistance of the water is parallel to the direction of the impulse. A line CI may be drawn parallel to the lines Di, Ee, Ff, and equal to their sum; and it may be drawn from such a point C, that the actions on all the parts of the hull between C and B may balance the momenta of all the actions on the hull between C and A. This point may justly be called the centre of effort, or centre of resistance. We cannot determine this point effort for want of a proper theory of the resistance of fluids. Nay, although experiments like those of the Parisian academy should give us the most perfect knowledge of the intensity of the oblique impulsions on a square foot, we should hardly be benefited by them: for the action of the water on a square foot of the hull at p, for instance, is so modified by the intervention of the stream of water which has struck the hull about B, and glided along the bow Bo p, that the prelure on p is totally different from what it would have been were it a square foot or surface detached from the rest, and presented in the same position to the water moving in the direction bC. For it is found, that the resistances given to planes joined so as to form a wedge, or to curved surfaces, are widely different from the accumulated resistances, calculated for their separate parts, agreeably to the experiments of the academy on single surfaces. We therefore do not attempt to ascertain the point C by theory; but it may be accurately determined by the experiments which we have so strongly recommended; and we offer this as an additional inducement for prosecuting them.\n\nDraw through C a line perpendicular to CI, that is, to be parallel to the sails; and let the lines of impulse of the trimmed three sails cut it in the points i, k, and m. This line by experiments im may be considered as a lever, moveable round C, and acted on at the points i, k, and m, by three forces. The rotary momentum of the sails on the mizzenmast is Di × iC; that of the sails on the mainmast is Ee × kC; and the momentum of the sails on the foremast is Ff × mC. The two first tend to press forward the arm Ci, and then to turn the ship's head towards the wind. The action of the sails on the foremast tends to pull the arm Cm forward, and produce a contrary pre-rotation. If the ship under these three sails keeps steadily in her course, without the aid of the rudder, we of the sails must have Di × iC + Ee × kC = Ff × mC. This is very possible, and is often seen in a ship under her mizen-topmast, main-topmast, and fore-topmast, all parallel to one another, and their surfaces duly proportioned by reefing. If more sails are set, we must always have a similar equilibrium. A certain number of them will have their efforts directed from the larboard arm of the lever im lying to leeward of CI, and a certain number will have their efforts directed from the starboard arm lying to windward of CI. The sum of the products of each of the first set, by their distances from C, must be equal.\nequal to the sum of the similar products of the other feet. As this equilibrium is all that is necessary for preserving the ship's position, and the cessation of it is immediately followed by a conversion; and as these states of the ship may be had by means of the three square sails only, when their surfaces are properly proportioned—it is plain that every movement may be executed and explained by their means. This will greatly simplify our future discussions. We shall therefore suppose in future that there are only the three topsails set, and that their surfaces are so adjusted by reefing, that their actions exactly balance each other round that point C of the middle line AB, where the actions of the water on the different parts of her bottom in like manner balance each other. This point C may be differently situated in the ship according to the leeway she makes, depending on the trim of the sails; and therefore although a certain proportion of the three surfaces may balance each other in one state of leeway, they may happen not to do so in another state. But the equilibrium is evidently attainable in every case, and we therefore shall always suppose it.\n\nIt must now be observed, that when this equilibrium is destroyed, as, for example, by turning the edge of the mizen-topmast to the wind, which the seamen call \"diverting the mizen-topmast,\" and which may be considered as equivalent to the removing the mizen-topmast entirely, it does not follow that the ship will round the point C, this point remaining fixed. The ship must be considered as a free body, still acted on by a number of forces, which no longer balance each other; and she must therefore begin to turn round a spontaneous axis of conversion, which must be determined in the way set forth in the article ROTATION. It is of importance to point out in general where this axis is situated. Therefore let G (fig. 10.) be the centre of gravity of the ship. Draw the line qGv parallel to the yards, cutting Dd in q, Ee in r, CI in t, and Ff in v. While the three sails are set, the line qv may be considered as a lever acted on by four forces, viz. Dd, impelling the lever forward perpendicularly in the point q; Ee, impelling it forward in the point r; Ff, impelling it forward in the point t; and CI, impelling it backward in the point u. These forces balance each other both in respect of progressive motion and of rotatory energy: for CI was taken equal to the sum of Dd, Ee, and Ff; so that no acceleration or retardation of the ship's progress in her course is supposed.\n\nBut by taking away the mizen-topmast, both the equilibriums are destroyed. A part Dd of the accelerating force is taken away; and yet the ship, by her inertia or inherent force, tends, for a moment, to proceed in the direction Cp with her former velocity; and by this tendency exerts for a moment the same pressure CI on the water, and sustains the same resistance IC. She must therefore be retarded in her motion by the excess of the resistance IC over the remaining impelling forces Ee and Ff, that is, by a force equal and opposite to Dd. She will therefore be retarded in the same manner as if the mizen-topmast were still set, and a force equal and opposite to its action were applied to G the centre of gravity, and she would soon acquire a smaller velocity, which would again bring all things into equilibrium; and she would stand on in the same course, without changing either her leeway or the position of her head.\n\nBut the equilibrium of the lever is also destroyed. It is now acted on by three forces only, viz. Ee and Ff, impelling it forward in the points r and v, and IC impelling it backward in the point t. Make rv : rv = Ee + Ff : Ff, and make op parallel to CI and equal to Ee - Ff. Then we know, from the common principles of mechanics, that the force op acting at o will have the same momentum or energy to turn the lever round any point whatever as the two forces Ee and Ff applied at r and v; and now the lever is acted on by two forces, viz. IC, urging it backwards in the point t, and op urging it forwards in the point o. It must therefore turn round like a floating log, which gets two blows in opposite directions. If we now make IC - op : op = t : x, or IC - op : IC = t : op, and apply to the point x a force equal to IC - op in the direction IC; we know by the common principles of mechanics, that this force IC - op will produce the same rotation round any point as the two forces IC and op applied in their proper directions at t and o. Let us examine the situation of the point x.\n\nThe force IC - op is evidently = Dd, and op = Ee + Ff. Therefore ot : tx = Dd : op. But because, when all the sails were filled, there was an equilibrium round C, and therefore round t, and because the force op acting at o is equivalent to Ee and Ff acting at r and v, we must still have the equilibrium; and therefore we have the momentum Dd × qt = op × ot. Therefore ot : tx = Dd : op, and tx = ot. Therefore the point x is the same with the point q.\n\nTherefore, when we shiver the mizen-topmast, the rotation of the ship is the same as if the ship were at rest, and a force equal and opposite to the action of the mizen-topmast were applied at q or at D, or at any point in the line Dq.\n\nThis might have been shown in another and shorter way. Suppose all sails filled, the ship is in equilibrium. This will be disturbed by applying to D a force opposite to Dd; and if the force be also equal to Dd, it is evident that these two forces destroy each other, and that this application of the force dD is equivalent to the taking away of the mizen-topmast. But we choose to give the whole mechanical investigation; because it gave us an opportunity of pointing out to the reader, in a case of very easy comprehension, the precise manner in which the ship is acted on by the different sails and by the water, and what share each of them has in the motion ultimately produced. We shall not repeat this manner of procedure in other cases, because a little reflection on the part of the reader will now enable him to trace the modus operandi through all its steps.\n\nWe now see that, in respect both of progressive motion and of conversion, the ship is affected by shivering the sail D, in the same manner as if a force equal and opposite to Dd were applied at D, or at any point in the line Dd. We must now have recourse to the principles established under the article ROTATION.\n\nLet p represent a particle of matter, r its radius vector, or its distance pG from an axis passing through the centre of gravity G, and let M represent the whole quantity of matter of the ship. Then its momentum of inertia is \\( \\int p \\cdot r \\) (see ROTATION, No. 18.) The ship, impelled in the point D by a force in the direction Dd, will begin to turn round a spontaneous vertical axis, passing through a point S of the line qG, which\nwhich is drawn through the centre of gravity G, perpendicular to the direction dD of the external force, and the distance GS of this axis from the centre of gravity is\n\n\\[ \\frac{p}{M \\cdot G} q^2 \\] (see Rotation, No 96.), and it is taken on the opposite side of G from q, that is, S and q are on opposite sides of G.\n\nLet us express the external force by the symbol F. It is equivalent to a certain number of pounds, being the pressure of the wind moving with the velocity V and inclination a on the surface of the sail; and may therefore be computed either by the theoretical or experimental law of oblique impulses. Having obtained this, we can ascertain the angular velocity of the rotation and the absolute velocity of any given point of the ship by means of the theorems established in the article Rotation.\n\nBut before we proceed to this investigation, we shall consider the action of the rudder, which operates precisely in the same manner. Let the ship AB (fig. 11.) have her rudder in the position AD, the helm being hard a-starboard, while the ship falling on the starboard tack, and making leeway, keeps on the course ab. The lee surface of the rudder meets the water obliquely. The very foot of the rudder meets it in the direction DE parallel to ab. The parts farther up meet it with various obliquities, and with various velocities, as it glides round the bottom of the ship and falls into the wake. It is absolutely impossible to calculate the accumulated impulse. We shall not be far mistaken in the deflection of each contiguous filament, as it quits the bottom and glides along the rudder; but we neither know the velocity of these filaments, nor the deflection and velocity of the filaments gliding without them. We therefore imagine that all computations on this subject are in vain. But it is enough for our purpose that we know the direction of the absolute pressure which they exert on its surface. It is in the direction Dd, perpendicular to that surface. We also may be confident that this pressure is very considerable, in proportion to the action of the water on the ship's bows, or of the wind on the sails; and we may suppose it to be nearly in the proportion of the square of the velocity of the ship in its course; but we cannot affirm it to be accurately in that proportion, for reasons that will readily occur to one who considers the way in which the water falls in behind the ship.\n\nIt is observed, however, that a fine faller always flows well, and that all movements by means of the rudder are performed with great rapidity when the velocity of the ship is great. We shall see by and by, that the speed with which the ship performs the angular movements is in the proportion of her progressive velocity: For we shall see that the squares of the times of performing the evolution are as the impulses inversely, which are as the squares of the velocities. There is perhaps no force which acts on a ship that can be more accurately determined by experiment than this. Let the ship ride in a stream or tide-way whose velocity is accurately measured; and let her ride from two moorings, so that her bow may be a fixed point. Let a small tow-line be laid out from her stern or quarter at right angles to the keel, and connected with some apparatus fitted up on shore or on board another ship, by which the strain on it may be accurately measured; a person conversant with mechanics will see many ways in which this can be done. Perhaps the following may be as good as any: Let the end of the tow-line be fixed to some point as high out of the water as the point of the ship from which it is given out, and let this be very high. Let a block with a hook be on the rope, and a considerable weight hung on this hook. Things being thus prepared, put down the helm to a certain angle, so as to cause the ship to sheer off from the point to which the far end of the tow-line is attached. This will stretch the rope, and raise the weight out of the water. Now heave upon the rope, to bring the ship back again to her former position, with her keel in the direction of the stream. When this position is attained, note carefully the form of the rope, that is, the angle which its two parts make with the horizon. Call this angle a. Every person acquainted with these subjects knows that the horizontal strain is equal to half the weight multiplied by the cotangent of a, or that 2 is to the cotangent of a as the weight to the horizontal strain. Now it is this strain which balances and therefore measures the action of the rudder, or De in fig. 11. Therefore, to have the absolute impulse Dd, we must increase De in the proportion of radius to the secant of the angle b which the rudder makes with the keel. In a great ship falling six miles in an hour, the impulse on the rudder inclined 35° to the keel is not less than 3000 pounds. The surface of the rudder of such a ship contains near 80 square feet. It is not, however, very necessary to know this absolute impulse Dd, because it is its part De alone which measures the energy of the rudder in producing a conversion. Such experiments, made with various positions of the rudder, will give its energies corresponding to these positions, and will settle that long disputed point, which is the best position for turning a ship. On the hypothesis that the impulsions of fluids are in the duplicate ratio of the fines of incidence, there can be no doubt that it should make an angle of 54° 44' with the keel. But the form of a large ship will not admit of this, because a tiller of a length sufficient for managing the rudder in falling with great velocity has not room to deviate above 35° from the direction of the keel; and in this position of the rudder the mean obliquity of the filaments of water to its surface cannot exceed 40° or 45°. A greater angle would not be of much service, for it is never for want of a proper obliquity that the rudder fails of producing a conversion.\n\nA ship will stay in rough weather for want of a sufficient progressive velocity, and because her bows are miffes stays, beat off by the waves: and there is seldom any difficulty in wearing the ship, if she has any progressive motion. It is, however, always desirable to give the rudder as much influence as possible. Its surface should be enlarged (especially below) as much as can be done confidently with its strength and with the power of the steermen to manage it; and it should be put in the most favourable situation for the water to get at it with great velocity; and it should be placed as far from the axis of the ship's motion as possible. These points are obtained by making the stern-post very upright, as has always been done in the French dockyards. The British ships have a much greater rake; but our builders are gradually adopting the French forms, experience having\nSEAMANSHIP.\n\nThe action of the rudder similar to that of the sails, and very great.\n\nThus the action and effects of the sails and of the rudder are perfectly similar, and are to be considered in the same manner. We see that the action of the rudder, though of a small surface in comparison of the sails, must be very great: For the impulse of water is many hundred times greater than that of the wind; and the arm \\( qG \\) of the lever, by which it acts, is incomparably greater than that by which any of the impulsions on the sails produces its effect; accordingly the ship yields much more rapidly to its action than she does to the lateral impulse of a sail.\n\nObserve here, that if \\( G \\) were a fixed or supported axis, it would be the same thing whether the absolute force \\( Dd \\) of the rudder acts in the direction \\( De \\), or its transverse part \\( De \\) acts in the direction \\( De \\), both would produce the same rotation; but it is not so in a free body. The force \\( Dd \\) both tends to retard the ship's motion and to produce a rotation: It retards it as much as if the same force \\( Dd \\) had been immediately applied to the centre. And thus the real motion of the ship is compounded of a motion of the centre in a direction parallel to \\( Dd \\), and of a motion round the centre. These two constitute the motion round \\( S \\).\n\nAs the effects of the action of the rudder are both more remarkable and somewhat more simple than those of the sails, we shall employ them as an example of the mechanism of the motions of conversion in general; and as we must content ourselves in a work like this with what is very general, we shall simplify the investigation by attending only to the motion of conversion. We can get an accurate notion of the whole motion, if wanted for any purpose, by combining the progressive or retrograde motion parallel to \\( Dd \\) with the motion of rotation which we are about to determine.\n\nIn this case, then, we observe, in the first place, that the angular velocity (see Rotation, No. 22.) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{Dh \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2}\n\\]\n\nand, as was shown in that article, this velocity of rotation increases in the proportion of the time of the forces uniform action, and the rotation would be uniformly accelerated if the forces did really act uniformly. This, however, cannot be the case, because, by the ship's change of position and change of progressive velocity, the direction and intensity of the impelling force is continually changing. But if two ships are performing similar evolutions, it is obvious that the changes of force are similar in similar parts of the evolution. Therefore the consideration of the momentary evolution is sufficient for enabling us to compare the motions of ships actuated by similar forces, which is all we have in view at present.\n\nThe velocity \\( v \\), generated in any time \\( t \\) by the continuance of an invariable momentary acceleration (which is all that we mean by saying that it is produced by the action of a constant accelerating force), is as the acceleration and the time jointly. Now what we call the angular velocity is nothing but this momentary acceleration. Therefore the velocity \\( v \\) generated in the time \\( t \\) is\n\n\\[\nv = \\frac{F \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2} \\cdot t\n\\]\n\nThe expression of the angular velocity is also the expression of the velocity \\( v \\) of a point situated at the distance \\( r \\) from the axis \\( G \\).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the space or arch of revolution described in the time \\( t \\) by this point, whose distance from \\( G \\) is \\( r \\). Then \\( x = v \\cdot t = \\frac{F \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2} \\cdot t^2 \\), and taking the fluent \\( x = \\frac{F \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2} \\cdot t^3 \\). This arch measures the whole angle of rotation accomplished in the time \\( t \\). These are therefore as the squares of the times from the beginning of the rotation.\n\nThose evolutions are equal which are measured by equal arches. Thus two motions of 45 degrees each are equal. Therefore because \\( x \\) is the same in both, the quantity \\( \\frac{F \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2} \\cdot t^2 \\) is a constant quantity, and \\( t^2 \\) is reciprocally proportional to \\( \\frac{F \\cdot qG}{\\int \\rho r^2} \\), or is proportional to \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\int \\rho r^2}}{\\sqrt{F \\cdot qG}} \\). That is to say, the times of the similar evolutions of two ships are as the square root of the momentum of inertia directly, and as the square root of the momentum of the rudder or sail inversely. This will enable us to make the comparison easily. Let us suppose the ships perfectly similar in form and rigging, and to differ only in length \\( L \\) and \\( l \\); \\( P \\cdot R^2 \\) is to \\( \\int \\rho r^2 \\) as \\( L^3 \\) to \\( l^3 \\).\n\nFor the similar particles \\( P \\) and \\( p \\) contain quantities of matter which are as the cubes of their linear dimensions, that is, as \\( L^3 \\) to \\( l^3 \\). And because the particles are similarly situated, \\( R^2 \\) is to \\( r^2 \\) as \\( L^2 \\) to \\( l^2 \\). Therefore \\( P \\cdot R^2 : p \\cdot r^2 = L^5 : l^5 \\). Now \\( F \\) is to \\( f \\) as \\( L^2 \\) to \\( l^2 \\).\n\nFor the surfaces of the similar rudders or sails are as the squares of their linear dimensions, that is, as \\( L^2 \\) to \\( l^2 \\). And, lastly, \\( G \\cdot q \\) is to \\( g \\cdot q \\) as \\( L \\) to \\( l \\), and therefore \\( F \\cdot G \\cdot q : f \\cdot g \\cdot q = L^3 : l^3 \\). Therefore we have \\( T^2 : \\)\n\n\\[\nT^2 = \\frac{\\int P \\cdot R^2}{F \\cdot G \\cdot q} : \\frac{\\int p \\cdot r^2}{f \\cdot g \\cdot q} = \\frac{L^5}{l^5} : \\frac{L^3}{l^3} = L^2 : l^2, \\quad \\text{and } T : t = L : l.\n\\]\n\nTherefore the times of performing similar evolutions with similar ships are proportional to the lengths of the similar ships when both are falling equally fast; and since the similar evolutions are similar, and the forces vary similarly in their\ntheir different parts, what is here demonstrated of the smallest incipient evolutions is true of the whole. They therefore not only describe equal angles of revolution, but also similar curves.\n\nA small ship, therefore, works in less time and in less room than a great ship, and this in the proportion of its length. This is a great advantage in all cases, particularly in wearing, in order to fall on the other tack close-hauled. In this case she will always be to windward and ahead of the large ship, when both are got on the other tack. It would appear at first sight that the large ship will have the advantage in tacking. Indeed the large ship is farther to windward when again trimmed on the other tack than the small ship when she is just trimmed on the other tack. But this happened before the large ship had completed her evolution, and the small ship, in the mean time, has been going forward on the other tack, and going to windward. She will therefore be before the large ship's beam, and perhaps as far to windward.\n\nWe have seen that the velocity of rotation is proportional, ceteris paribus, to $F \\times G q$. F means the absolute impulse on the rudder or sail, and is always perpendicular to its surface. This absolute impulse on a sail depends on the obliquity of the wind to its surface. The usual theory says, that it is as the square of the sine of incidence; but we find this not true. We must content ourselves with expressing it by some yet unknown function $\\phi$ of the angle of incidence $\\alpha$, and call it $\\phi \\alpha$; and if $S$ be the surface of the sail, and $V$ the velocity of the wind, the absolute impulse is $n V^2 S \\times \\phi \\alpha$. This acts (in the case of the mizen-topmast, fig. 10.) by the lever $q G$, which is equal to $DG \\times \\text{cof.} DG q$, and $DG q$ is equal to the angle of the yard and keel; which angle we formerly called $b$. Therefore its energy in producing a rotation is $n V^2 S \\times \\phi \\alpha \\times DG \\times \\text{cof.} b$. Leaving out the constant quantities $n$, $V^2$, $S$, and $DG$, its energy is proportional to $\\phi \\alpha \\times \\text{cof.} b$. In order, therefore, that any sail may have the greatest power to produce a rotation round $G$, it must be so trimmed that $\\phi \\alpha \\times \\text{cof.} b$ may be a maximum. Thus, if we would trim the sails on the foremast, so as to pay the ship off from the wind right ahead with the greatest effect, and if we take the experiments of the French academicians as proper measures of the oblique impulses of the wind on the sail, we will brace up the yard to an angle of 48 degrees with the keel. The impulse corresponding to 48° is 615, and the cosine of 48° is 669. These give a product of 411435. If we brace the sail to 54.44°, the angle assigned by the theory, the effective impulse is 403274. If we make the angle 45°, the impulse is 408774. It appears then that 48° is preferable to either of the others. But the difference is inconsiderable, as in all cases of maximum a small deviation from the best position is not very detrimental. But the difference between the theory and this experimental measure will be very great when the impulses of the wind are of necessity very oblique. Thus, in tacking ship, as soon as the headails are taken aback, they serve to aid the evolution, as is evident: But if we were now to adopt the maxims inculcated by the theory, we should immediately round in the weather-braces, so as to increase the impulse on the sail, because it is then very small; and although we by this means make yard more square, and therefore diminish the rotatory momentum of this impulse, yet the impulse is more increased (by the theory) than its vertical lever is diminished.\n\nLet us examine this a little more particularly, because it is reckoned one of the nicest points of seamanship to aid the ship's coming round by means of the headails; and experienced seamen differ in their practice in this manoeuvre. Suppose the yard braced up to 48°, which is as much as can be usually done, and that the sail flutters (the bowlines are usually let go when the helm is put down), the sail immediately takes aback, and in a moment we may suppose an incidence of 6 degrees. The impulse corresponding to this is 400, (by experiment), and the cosine of 48° is 766. This gives 306400 for the effective impulse. To proceed according to the theory, we should brace the yard to 70°, which would give the wind (now 34° on the weather-bow) an incidence of nearly 36°; and the sail an inclination of 26° to the intended motion, which is perpendicular to the keel. For the tangent of 26° is about $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the tangent of 36°. Let us now see what effective impulse the experimental law of oblique impulsions will give for this adjustment of the sails. The experimental impulse for 36° is 480; the cosine of 70° is 342; the product is 164160, not much exceeding the half of the former. Nay, the impulse for 36°, calculated by the theory, would have been only 346, and the effective impulse only 118332. And it must be further observed, that this theoretical adjustment would tend greatly to check the evolution, and in most cases would entirely mar it, by checking the ship's motion ahead, and consequently the action of the rudder, which is the most powerful agent in the evolution; for here would be a great impulse directed almost aft.\n\nWe were justified, therefore, in saying, in the beginning of this article, that a seaman would frequently find himself baffled if he were to work a ship according to the rules deduced from M. Bouguer's work; and we see by this instance of what importance it is to have the oblique impulsions of fluids ascertained experimentally. The practice of the most experienced seaman is directly the opposite to this theoretical maxim, and its success greatly confirms the usefulness of these experiments of the academicians so often praised by us.\n\nWe return again to the general consideration of the rotatory motion. We found the velocity $v = \\frac{F \\cdot q \\cdot G}{\\int p \\cdot r^2}$. It is therefore proportional, ceteris paribus, to $q \\cdot G$. We have seen in what manner $q \\cdot G$ depends on the position and situation of the sail or rudder when the point $G$ is fixed. But it also depends on the position of $G$. With respect to the action of the rudder, it is evident that it is so much the more powerful as it is more remote from $G$. The distance from $G$ may be increased either by moving the rudder farther aft or farther forward. And as it is of the utmost importance that a ship answer her helm with the greatest promptitude, those circumstances have been attended to which distinguished fine steering ships from such as had not this quality; and it is in a great measure to be ascribed to this, that, in the gradual improvement of naval architecture, the centre of gravity has been placed far forward. Perhaps the notion of a centre of gravity did not come into the thoughts of the rude builders in early times; but they observed that those boats and ships steered best which had...\nhad their extreme breadth before the middle point, and consequently the bows not so acute as the stern. This is so contrary to what one would expect, that it attracted attention more forcibly; and, being somewhat mysterious, it might prompt to attempts of improvement, by exceeding in this singular maxim. We believe that it has been carried as far as is compatible with other essential requisites in a ship.\n\nWe believe that this is the chief circumstance in what is called the trim of a ship; and it were greatly to be wished that the best place for the centre of gravity could be accurately ascertained. A practice prevails, which is the opposite of what we are now advancing. It is usual to load a ship so that her keel is not horizontal, but lower abaft. This is found to improve her steerage. The reason of this is obvious. It increases the acting surface of the rudder, and allows the water to come at it with much greater freedom and regularity; and it generally diminishes the gripping of the ship forward, by removing a part of the bows out of the water. It has not always this effect; for the form of the harping aloft is frequently such, that the tendency to grip is diminished by immersing more of the bow in the water.\n\nBut waving these circumstances, and attending only to the rotatory energy of the rudder, we see that it is of advantage to carry the centre of gravity forward. The same advantage is gained to the action of the after sails. But, on the other hand, the action of the head sails is diminished by it; and we may call every sail a headail whose centre of gravity is before the centre of gravity of the ship; that is, all the sails hoisted on the bowsprit and foremast, and the staysails hoisted on the mainmast; for the centre of gravity is seldom far before the mainmast.\n\nSuppose that when the rudder is put into the position AD (fig. 11.), the centre of gravity could be shifted to g, so as to increase qG, and that this is done without increasing the sum of the products pr². It is obvious that the velocity of conversion will be increased in the proportion of qG to gg. This is very possible, by bringing to that side of the ship parts of her loading which were situated at a distance from G on the other side. Nay, we can make this change in such a manner that ∫pr² shall even be less than it was before, by taking care that everything which we shift shall be nearer to g than it was formerly to G. Suppose it all placed in one spot m, and that m is the quantity of matter to shifted, while M is the quantity of matter in the whole ship. It is only necessary that m · G² shall be less than the sum of the products pr² corresponding to the matter which has been shifted. Now, although the matter which is easily moveable is generally very small in comparison to the whole matter of the ship, and therefore can make but a small change in the place of the centre of gravity, it may frequently be brought from places so remote that it may occasion a very sensible diminution of the quantity ∫pr², which expresses the whole momentum of inertia.\n\nThis explains a practice of the seamen in small wherries or skiffs, who in putting about are accustomed to place themselves to leeward of the mast. They even find that they can aid the quick motions of these light boats by the way in which they rest on their two feet, sometimes leaning all on one foot, and sometimes on the other. And we have often seen this evolution very sensibly accelerated in a ship of war, by the crew running suddenly, as the helm is put down, to the lee-bow. And we have heard it asserted by very expert seamen, that after all attempts to wear ship (after lying-to in a storm) have failed, they have succeeded by the crew collecting themselves near the weather fore-throats the moment the helm was put down. It must be agreeable to the reflecting seaman to see this practice supported by undoubted mechanical principles.\n\nIt will appear paradoxical to say that the evolution may be accelerated even by an addition of matter to the ship; and though it is only a piece of curiosity, our readers may wish to be made sensible of it. Let m be the additional matter, placed in some point m lying beyond G from g. Let S be the spontaneous centre of conversion before the addition. Let v be the velocity of rotation round g, that is, the velocity of a point whose distance from g is r, and let ρ be the radius vector, or distance of a particle from g. We have (Rotation, No. 22.) \\( v = \\frac{F \\cdot qg}{\\int p \\cdot r^2 + m \\cdot mg} \\). But we know (Rotation, No. 23.) that \\( \\int p \\cdot r^2 = \\int p \\cdot r^2 + M \\cdot G \\cdot s^2 \\). Therefore \\( v = \\frac{F \\cdot qg}{\\int p \\cdot r^2 + M \\cdot G \\cdot s^2 + m \\cdot mg} \\). Let us determine G, g and mg and qg.\n\nLet mG be called z. Then, by the nature of the centre of gravity, \\( M + m : M = G : g \\), \\( m = \\frac{M}{M + m} \\), and \\( g = \\frac{m}{M + m} \\). In like manner, \\( M \\cdot G \\cdot s^2 = \\frac{M \\cdot m}{M + m} \\cdot s^2 \\). Now \\( M \\cdot m + M \\cdot m = \\frac{M \\cdot m}{M + m} \\cdot s^2 \\). Therefore \\( M \\cdot G \\cdot s^2 + m \\cdot g \\cdot s^2 = \\frac{M \\cdot m}{M + m} \\cdot s^2 \\). Let n be \\( \\frac{m}{M + m} \\), then \\( M \\cdot G \\cdot s^2 + m \\cdot g \\cdot s^2 = M \\cdot n \\cdot s^2 \\). Also \\( G \\cdot g = n \\cdot s^2 \\), being \\( \\frac{m}{M + m} \\cdot s^2 \\). Let qG be called c: then \\( q \\cdot g = c + n \\cdot s^2 \\). Also let Sg be called e.\n\nWe have now for the expression of the velocity \\( v = \\frac{F \\cdot (c + n \\cdot s^2)}{\\int p \\cdot r^2 + M \\cdot n \\cdot s^2} \\), or \\( v = \\frac{F}{M} \\times \\frac{c + n \\cdot s^2}{\\int p \\cdot r^2 + M \\cdot n \\cdot s^2} \\). But \\( \\frac{\\int p \\cdot r^2}{M} = c \\cdot e \\). Therefore, finally, \\( v = \\frac{F}{M} \\times \\frac{c + n \\cdot s^2}{c \\cdot e + n \\cdot s^2} \\). Had there been no addition of matter made, we should have had \\( v = \\frac{F}{M} \\times \\frac{c}{c \\cdot e} \\). It remains to show, that \\( s^2 \\) may be so taken that \\( \\frac{c}{c \\cdot e} \\) may be less than \\( \\frac{c + n \\cdot s^2}{c \\cdot e + n \\cdot s^2} \\). New, if c be to s as c to s², that is, if \\( s^2 \\) be...\nbe taken equal to \\( e \\), the two fractions will be equal. But if \\( x \\) be less than \\( e \\), that is, if the additional matter is placed anywhere between \\( S \\) and \\( G \\), the complex fraction will be greater than the fraction \\( \\frac{c}{e} \\), and the velocity of rotation will be increased. There is a particular distance which will make it the greatest possible, namely, when \\( x \\) is made \\( = \\frac{1}{n} (\\sqrt{c^2 + nc} - c) \\), as will easily be found by treating the fraction \\( \\frac{c + n}{c + n x} \\), with \\( x \\), considered as the variable quantity, for a maximum.\n\nIn what we have been saying on this subject, we have considered the rotation only in as much as it is performed round the centre of gravity, although in every moment it is really performed round a spontaneous axis lying beyond that centre. This was done because it afforded an easy investigation, and any angular motion round the centre of gravity is equal to the angular motion round any other point. Therefore the extent and the time of the evolution are accurately defined.\n\nFrom observing that the energy of the force \\( F \\) is proportional to \\( qG \\), an inattentive reader will be apt to conceive the centre of gravity as the centre of motion, and the rotation as taking place, because the momenta of the sails and rudder, on the opposite sides of the centre of gravity, do not balance each other. But we must always keep in mind that this is not the cause of the rotation. The cause is the want of equilibrium round the point \\( C \\) (fig. 10.), where the actions of the water balance each other. During the evolution, which consists of a rotation combined with a progressive motion, this point \\( C \\) is continually shifting, and the unbalanced momenta which continue the rotation always respect the momentary situation of the point \\( C \\). It is nevertheless always true that the energy of a force \\( F \\) is proportional (ceteris paribus) to \\( qG \\), and the rotation is always made in the same direction as if the point \\( G \\) were really the centre of conversion. Therefore the mainail acts always (when oblique) by pushing the stern away from the wind, although it should sometimes act on a point of the vertical lever through \\( C \\), which is ahead of \\( C \\).\n\nThese observations on the effects of the sails and rudder in producing a conversion, are sufficient for enabling us to explain any case of their action which may occur. We have not considered the effects which they tend to produce by inclining the ship round a horizontal axis, viz., the motions of rolling and pitching. See Rolling and Pitching. To treat this subject properly would lead us into the whole doctrine of the equilibrium of floating bodies, and it would rather lead to maxims of construction than to maxims of manoeuvre.\n\nM. Bouguer's Traité du Navire and Euler's Scientia Nautica are excellent performances on this subject, and we are not here obliged to have recourse to any erroneous theory.\n\nIt is easy to see that the lateral pressure both of the wind on the sails and of the water on the rudder tends to incline the ship to one side. The sails also tend to press the ship's bows into the water, and, if they were kept from advancing, would press them down considerably. But by the ship's motion, and the prominent form of her bows, the resistance of the water to the fore part of the ship produces a force which is directed upwards. The sails also have a small tendency to raise the ship, for they constitute a surface which in general separates from the plumb-line below. This is remarkably the case in the staysails, particularly the jib and fore-topmast staysail. And this helps greatly to soften the plunges of the ship's bows into the head seas. The upward pressure also of the water on her bows, which we just now mentioned, has a great effect in opposing the immersion of the bows which the sails produce by acting on the long levers furnished by the masts.\n\nM. Bouguer gives the name of point velique to the point \\( V \\) (fig. 12.) of the mast, where it is cut by the line \\( CV \\), which marks the mean place and direction of the whole impulse of the water on the bows. And he observes, that if the mean direction of all the actions of the wind on the sails be made to pass also through this point, there will be a perfect equilibrium, and the ship will have no tendency to plunge into the water or to rise out of it; for the whole action of the water on the bows, in the direction \\( CV \\), is equivalent to, and may be resolved into the action \\( CE \\), by which the progressive motion is resisted, and the vertical action \\( CD \\), by which the ship is raised above the water. The force \\( CE \\) must be opposed by an equal force \\( VD \\), exerted by the wind on the sails, and the force \\( CD \\) is opposed by the weight of the ship. If the mean effort of the sails presses above the point \\( V \\), the ship's bow will be pressed into the water; and if it passes below \\( V \\), her stern will be pressed down. But, by the union of these forces, the will rise and fall with the sea, keeping always in a parallel position. We apprehend that it is of very little moment to attend to the situation of this point. Except when the ship is right abreast the wind, it is a thousand chances to one that the line \\( CV \\) of mean resistance does not pass through any mast; and the fact is, that the ship cannot be in a state of uniform motion on any other condition but the perfect union of the line of mean action of the sails, and the line of mean action of the resistance. But its place shifts by every change of leeway or trim; and it is impossible to keep these lines in one constant point of intersection for a moment, on account of the incessant changes of the surface of the water on which the floats. M. Bouguer's observations on this point are, however, very ingenious and original.\n\nWe conclude this dissertation, by describing some of Chief evolutions described hitherto is intended for the instruction of the artificer, by making him sensible of the mechanical procedure. The description is rather meant for the amusement of the landsman, enabling him to understand operations that are familiar to the seaman. The latter will perhaps smile at the awkward account given of his business by one who cannot hand, reef, or steer.\n\nTo tack Ship.\n\nThe ship must first be kept full, that is, with a very sensible angle of incidence on the sails, and by no means hugging the wind. For as this evolution is chiefly performed by the rudder, it is necessary to give the ship a good velocity. When the ship is observed to luff up of herself, that moment is to be watched for beginning the evolution, because she will by her inherent force continue this motion. The helm is then put down. When the officer calls out Helm's alee, the fore-sheet, fore-top bowline, jib, and flag sail sheets forward.\nward are let go. The jib is frequently hauled down. Thus the obstacles to the ship's head coming up to the wind by the action of the rudder are removed. If the mainsail is set, it is not unusual to clue up the weather side, which may be considered as a headail, because it is before the centre of gravity. The mizen must be hauled out, and even the sail braced to windward. Its power in paying off the stern from the wind confines with the action of the rudder. It is really an aerial rudder. The sails are immediately taken aback. In this state the effect of the mizen-topail would be to obstruct the movement, by prelling the stern contrary way to what it did before. It is therefore either immediately braced about sharp on the other tack, or lowered. Bracing it about evidently tends to pay round the stern from the wind, and thus afflit in bringing the head up to the wind. But in this position it checks the progressive motion of the ship, on which the evolution chiefly depends. For a rapid evolution, therefore, it is as well to lower the mizen-topail. Meantime, the headails are all aback, and the action of the wind on them tends greatly to pay the ship round. To increase this effect, it is not unusual to haul the fore-top bowline again. The sails on the mainmast are now almost becalmed; and therefore when the wind is right ahead, or a little before, the mainail is hauled round and braced up sharp on the other tack with all expedition. The stayail sheets are now shifted over to their places for the other tack. The ship is now entirely under the power of the headails and of the rudder, and their actions confine to promote the conversion. The ship has acquired an angular motion, and will preserve it, so that now the evolution is secured, and the sails off space from the wind on the other tack. The farther action of the rudder is therefore unnecessary, and would even be prejudicial, by causing the ship to fall off too much from the wind before the sails can be shifted and trimmed for falling on the other tack. It is therefore proper to right the helm when the wind is right ahead, that is, to bring the rudder into the direction of the keel. The ship continues her conversion by her inherent force and the action of the headails.\n\nWhen the ship has fallen off about four points from the wind, the headails are hauled round, and trimmed sharp on the other tack with all expedition; and although this operation was begun with the wind four points on the bow, it will be fix before the sails are braced up, and therefore the headails will immediately fill. The after-sails have filled already, while the headails were inactive, and therefore immediately check the farther falling off from the wind. All sails now draw, for the stayail sheets have been shifted over while they were becalmed or shaking in the wind. The ship now gathers way, and will obey the smallest motion of the helm to bring her close to the wind.\n\nWe have here supposed, that during all this operation the ship preserves her progressive motion. She must therefore have described a curve line, advancing all the while to windward. Fig. 13. is a representation of this evolution when it is performed in the complete manner. The ship standing on the course E, with the wind blowing in the direction WF, has her helm put hard alee when she is in the position A. She immediately deviates from her course, and describing a curve, comes to the position B, with the wind blowing in the direction WF of the yards, and the square-sails now shiver. The mizen topsail is here represented braced sharp on the other tack, by which its tendency to aid the angular motion (while it checks the progressive motion) is distinctly seen. The main and foresails are now shivering, and immediately after are taken aback. The effect of this on the headails is distinctly seen to be favourable to the conversion, by pushing the point F in the direction Fi; but for the same reason it continues to retard the progressive motion. When the ship has attained to the position C, the mainail is hauled round and trimmed for the other tack. The impulse in the direction Fi still aids the conversion and retards the progressive motion. When the ship has attained a position between C and D, such that the main and mizen topsail yards are in the direction of the wind, there is nothing to counteract the force of the headails to pay the ship's head off from the wind. Nay, during the progress of the ship to this intermediate position, if any wind gets at the main or mizen topsails, it acts on their anterior surfaces, and impels the after parts of the ship away from the curve a b c d, and thus aids the revolution. We have therefore said, that when once the sails are taken fully aback, and particularly when the wind is brought right ahead, it is scarce possible for the evolution to fail; as soon therefore as the main topsail (trimmed for the other tack) shivers, we are certain that the headails will be filled by the time they are hauled round and trimmed. The stayails are filled before this, because their sheets have been shifted, and they stand much sharper than the square-sails; and thus everything tends to check the falling off from the wind on the other tack, and this no sooner than it should be done. The ship immediately gathers way, and holds on in her new course d G.\n\nBut it frequently happens, that in this conversion the ship loses her whole progressive motion. This sometimes happens while the sails are shivering before they are taken fully aback. It is evident, that in this case there is little hopes of success, for the ship now lies like a log, and neither sails nor rudder have any action. The ship drives to leeward like a log, and the water acting on the lee side of the rudder checks a little the driving of the stern. The head therefore falls off again, and by and by the sails fill, and the ship continues on her former tack. This is called missing stays, and it is generally owing to the ship's having too little velocity at the beginning of the evolution. Hence the propriety of keeping the sails well filled for some little time before. Rough weather, too, by raising a wave which beats violently on the weather-bow, frequently checks the first luffing of the ship, and beats her off again.\n\nIf the ship lose all her motion after the headails have been fully taken aback, and before we have brought the wind right ahead, the evolution becomes uncertain, but by no means desperate; for the action of the wind on the headails will presently give her sternway. Suppose this to happen when the ship is in the position C. Bring the helm over hard to windward, so that the rudder shall have the position represented by the small dotted line ef. It is evident, that the resistance of the water to the stern-way of the rudder acts in a favourable direction, pushing the stern outwards. In the mean time, the action of the wind on the headails pushes the head in the opposite direction. These actions\nTo wear Ship.\n\nWhen the seaman feels that his ship will not go about head to wind, but will miss stays, he must change his tack the other way; that is, by turning her head away from the wind, going a little way before the wind, and then hauling the wind on the other tack. This is called wearing or veering ship. It is most necessary in stormy weather with little sail, or in very faint breezes, or in a disabled ship.\n\nThe process is exceedingly simple; and the mere narration of the procedure is sufficient for showing the propriety of every part of it.\n\nWatch for the moment of the ship's falling off, and then haul up the mainail and mizen, and shiver the mizen topail, and put the helm a-weather. When the ship falls off sensibly (and not before), let go the bowlines. Ease away the fore-sheet, raise the fore-tack, and gather aft the weather fore-sheet, as the lee-sheet is eased away. Round in the weather-braces of the fore and main-masts, and keep the yards nearly bisecting the angle of the wind and keel, so that when the ship is before the wind the yards may be square. It may even be of advantage to round in the weather-braces of the main-topail more than those of the head-falls; for the mainail is abaft the centre of gravity. All this while the mizen-topail must be kept shivering, by rounding in the weather-braces as the ship pays off from the wind. Then the main topail will be braced up for the other tack by the time that we have brought the wind on the weather-quarter. After this it will be full, and will aid the evolution. When the wind is right aft, shift the jib and stay-fall sheets. The evolution now goes on with great rapidity; therefore briskly haul on board the fore and main tacks, and haul out the mizen, and let the mizen-stayfall as soon as they will take the wind the right way. We must now check the great rapidity with which the ship comes to the wind on the other tack, by righting the helm before we bring the wind on the beam; and all must be trimmed sharp fore and aft by this time, that the headfalls may take and check the coming-to. All being trimmed, stand on close by the wind.\n\nWe cannot help losing much ground in this movement. Therefore, though it be very simple, it requires much attention and rapid execution to do it with as little loss of ground as possible. One is apt to imagine at first that it would be better to keep the headfalls braced up on the former tack, or at least not to round in the weather-braces so much as is here directed. When the ship is right afore the wind, we should expect assistance from the obliquity of the head-falls; but the rudder being the principal agent in the evolution, it is found that more is gained by increasing the ship's velocity, than by a smaller impulse in the headfalls more favourably directed. Experienced seamen differ, however, in their practice in respect of this particular.\n\nTo box-haul a Ship.\n\nThis is a process performed only in critical situations, as when a rock, a cliff, or some danger, is suddenly seen right ahead, or when a ship misses stays. It requires the most rapid execution.\n\nThe ship being close-hauled on a wind, haul up the mainail\nmainail and mizen, and shiver the top-fails, and put the helm hard a-lee altogether. Raise the fore-tack, let go the head bowlines, and brace about the headails sharp on the other tack. The ship will quickly lose her way, get stern-way, and then fall off, by the joint action of the headails and of the inverted rudder. When she has fallen off eight points, brace the after-fails square, which have hitherto been kept shivering. This will at first increase the power of the rudder, by increasing the stern-way, and at the same time it makes no opposition to the conversion which is going on. The continuation of her circular motion will presently cause them to take the wind on their after surfaces. This will check the stern-way, stop it, and give the ship a little head-way. Now shift the helm, so that the rudder may again act in conjunction with the headails in paying her off from the wind. This is the critical part of the evolution, because the ship has little or no way through the water, and will frequently remain long in this position. But as there are no counteracting forces, the ship continues to fall off. Then the weather-braces of the after-fails may be gently rounded in, so that the wind acting on their hinder surfaces may both push the ship a little ahead and her stern laterally in conjunction with the rudder. Thus the wind is brought upon the quarter, and the headails shiver. By this time the ship has acquired some headway. A continuation of the rotation would now fill the headails, and their action would be contrary to the intended evolution. They are therefore immediately braced the other way, nearly square, and the evolution is now completed in the same manner with wearing ship.\n\nSome seamen brace all the sails aback the moment that the helm is put hard a-lee, but the after-fails no more aback than just to square the yards. This quickly gives the ship stern-way, and brings the rudder into action in its inverted direction; and they think that the evolution is accelerated by this method.\n\nThere is another problem of seamanship deserving of our attention, which cannot properly be called an evolution. This is lying-to. This is done in general by laying some sails aback, so as to stop the head-way produced by others. But there is a considerable address necessary for doing this in such a way that the ship shall lie easily, and under command, ready to proceed in her course, and easily brought under weigh.\n\nTo bring-to with the fore or main topsail to the mast, brace that fail sharp aback, haul out the mizen, and clap the helm hard a-lee.\n\nSuppose the fore topsail to be aback; the other sails shoot the ship ahead, and the lee-helm makes the ship come up to the wind, which makes it come more perpendicularly on the sail which is aback. Then its impulse soon exceeds those on the other sails, which are now shivering, or almost shivering. The ship stands still awhile, and then falls off, so as to fill the after-fails, which again shoot her ahead, and the process is thus repeated. A ship lying-to in this way goes a good deal ahead and also to leeward. If the main topsail be aback, the ship shoots ahead, and comes up till the diminished impulse of the drawing sails in the direction of the keel is balanced by the increased impulse on the main-topsail. She lies a long while in this position, driving slowly to leeward; and she at last falls off by the beating of the water on her weather-bow. She falls off but little, and soon comes up again.\n\nThus a ship lying-to is not like a mere log, but has a certain motion which keeps her under command. To get under weigh again, we must watch the time of falling off; and when this is just about to finish, brace about briskly, and fill the sail which was aback. To aid this operation, the jib and fore-topmast stay-sail may be hoisted, and the mizen brailed up: or, when the intended course is before the wind or large, back the foretopsail sharp, shiver the main and mizen topsail, brail up the mizen, and hoist the jib and fore-topmast stay-sails altogether.\n\nIn a storm with a contrary wind, or on a lee shore, a ship is obliged to lie-to under a very low sail. Some sail is absolutely necessary, in order to keep the ship steadily down, otherwise she would kick about like a cork, and roll too deep as to strain and work herself to pieces. Different ships behave best under different sails. In a very violent gale, the three lower stay-sails are in general well adapted for keeping her steady, and distributing the strain. This mode seems also well adapted for wearing, which may be done by hauling down the mizen-stay-sail. Under whatever sail the ship is brought to in a storm, it is always with a fitted sail, and never with one laid aback. The helm is lashed down hard a-lee; therefore the ship shoots ahead, and comes up till the sea on her weather-bow beats her off again. Getting under weigh is generally difficult; because the ship and rigging are lofty abaft, and hinder her from falling off readily when the helm is put hard a-weather. We must watch the falling off, and assist the ship by some small headail. Sometimes the crew get up on the weather fore-throds in a crowd, and thus present a surface to the wind.\n\nThese examples of the three chief evolutions will enable those who are not seamen to understand the propriety of the different steps, and also to understand the other evolutions as they are described by practical authors. We are not acquainted with any performance in our language where the whole are considered in a connected and systematic manner. There is a book on this subject in French, called Le Manoeuvrier, by M. Burde de Ville-Huet, which is in great reputation in France. A translation into English was published some years ago, said to be the performance of the Chevalier de Saufeuil a French officer. But this appears to be a bookeller's puff; for it is undoubtedly the work of some person who did not understand either the French language, or the subject, or the mathematical principles which are employed in the scientific part. The blunders are not such as could possibly be made by a Frenchman not versant in the English language, but natural for an Englishman ignorant of French. No French gentleman or officer would have translated a work of this kind (which he professes to think so highly of) to serve the rivals and foes of his country. But indeed it can do no great harm in this way; for the scientific part of it is absolutely unintelligible for want of science in the translator; and the practical part is full of blunders for want of knowledge of the French language.\n\nWe offer this account of the subject with all proper respect and diffidence. We do not profess to teach;\nbut by pointing out the defects of the celebrated works of M. Bouguer, and the course which may be taken to remove them, while we prefer much valuable knowledge which they contain, we may perhaps excite some persons to apply to this subject, who, by a combination of what is just in M. Bouguer's theory, with an experimental doctrine of the impulses of fluids, may produce a treatise of seamanship which will not be confined to the libraries of mathematicians, but become a manual for seamen by profession.\n\nSEAMEN, such persons as serve the king or others at sea by navigation and fighting ships, &c. See MARITIME State.\n\nSeamen fighting, quarrelling, or making any disturbance, may be punished by the commissioners of the navy with fine and imprisonment. Registered seamen are exempted from serving in any parish office, &c., and are allowed bounty-money beside their pay. By the law of merchants, the seamen of a vessel are accountable to the master or commander, the master to the owners, and the owners to the merchants, for damage sustained either by negligence or otherwise. Where a seaman is hired for a voyage, and he deserts before it is ended, he shall lose his wages; and in case a ship be lost in a storm, the seamen lose their wages, as well as the owners their freight.\n\nMeans of Preserving the Health of SEAMEN. See MEDICINE, No. 351.\n\nIn addition to what has been said on this subject in the place referred to, we shall addjoin some valuable observations which we have met with in the fifth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Society of Medicine at Paris for the years 1784 and 1785.\n\nIn 1783, the maréchal de Caïries, intending to make some changes in the regulations of the navy, particularly with regard to diet, proposed to the society the two following questions: 1. \"What are the most wholesome aliments for seamen, considering the impossibility of procuring them fresh meat? And what kinds of salt meat or fish, of pulse, and of drink, are most proper for them, and in what quantity, not omitting to inquire into the regimens in use amongst other maritime nations for what may be adopted by us, and into what experience has evinced the utility of, from the accounts of the most celebrated navigators?\" 2. \"A number of patients labouring under different diseases being assembled in naval hospitals, and different constitutions affected by the same disease requiring difference of diet, what general dietary rules for an hospital would be best adapted to every exigence, dividing the patients into three classes; the first in which liquids alone are proper, the second in which we begin to give solids in small quantities, and the state of convalescence in which a fuller diet is necessary?\" A committee was appointed to draw up an answer to these, who investigated the subject very minutely. The result of their labours is there given at large. The observations most worthy of notice are, that the fever of the English seamen, who live chiefly on salt-meat, is a putrid disease; whilst that of the Dutch, who use farinaceous vegetables and dried pulse in large quantities, has more of an hydropical tendency. A mixture of both, even at the same meal, is recommended. This is supported by philosophical reasoning, and the example of Captain Cook, who was partly indebted to this mixed regimen for the preservation of his crew. Salt fish should never be used: salt beef grows hard, and after boiling its fibrous parts only remain, which are more calculated to load the stomach than recruit the strength. Salt bacon may be kept at sea 18 months; it does not lose its moist and nutritious parts, and unites better with pulse, but should not be used when rancid. Live animals kept on board ships tend to produce diseases amongst the crew. Rice should be used largely. Our puddings are bad food: the flour would be much better made into bread, which might be done at sea with no great trouble. Sour kraut should be used freely. Mustard, vinegar, sugar, melasses, and honey, are good antiscorbutics. Of drinks, wine is the best: wort, spruce-beer, or the Russian quart, are good substitutes. Spirits are only to be used in cold climates, and in small quantity. The greater part of the excellent memoir in answer to the second question, perfectly coincides with M. Duhamel du Monceaux's \"Means of Preserving the Health of Seamen,\" and M. Polissonnier des Perrieres's treatises \"On the Diseases of Seamen,\" and \"On the advantages of changing the Diet of Seamen,\" and his \"Examination of Pringle's Dissertation.\"\n\nSEAPOYS, or SFOYS, natives of Indostan serving in a military capacity under the European powers, and disciplined after the European manner.\n\nThe Seapoys of the English East India company compose perhaps the most numerous, regular, and best disciplined body of black troops in the world. They are raised from among the natives of the country, and consist of Moors or Mahometans, Raja-poots, Hindoos, Pariars, besides many intermediate casts peculiar to themselves; the whole modelled in all corresponding particulars, and disciplined in every respect as the army of Great Britain.\n\nThe military establishments of Bengal, Madras and Bombay, have each their respective numbers, that of Bengal exceeding the rest. The Seapoys are formed into complete, uniform, and regular battalions, as our marching regiments at home, being intended to represent and answer fully to every purpose in India to the like troops in Europe. A battalion consists of 700 men, of complete effective strength. In each there are eight companies, including two flank ones or grenadiers. They are respectively commanded by their own black and European officers; to each company there is attached a subaltern, who takes the command, under whom are two native commissioned officers, bearing the rank of subedar and jemadar; of eight subalterns, five are lieutenants, the other ensigns; exclusive is a staff, of adjutant and surgeon. The black non-commissioned officers answer to our sergeants and corporals, and are called havildars and naigars. There is also to each corps an English sergeant-major, drill and store sergeant; to each battalion is a band of drums and fifes, and to each\nSea\n\nScapoys each a pair of colours. A captain commands the whole.\n\nTheir jackets, which are made entirely after the European fashion, are of a red colour with yellow facings (as worn by all the infantry of the company on the Coromandel coast). The remaining part of their attire resembles more the country or Indian habit, and consists of a dark blue turban, broad and round at top, descending deep to the bottom, the sides of which, of a concave form, are crotched by a white band, running in front, fastened under a rope above. As an under garment, they have a jacket of linen. A dark blue sash girding, to answer the turban, goes round their middle. On the thighs they have short drawers, fastened by a scolloped band. Their legs are bare, which renders them more ready for action or service. Their arms are a firelock and bayonet; their accoutrements or cross belts black leather, with pouches the same.\n\nA battalion drawn out cannot but strike the spectators with a lively and fanciful military impression, as they unite in their exterior traits respectively Indian and European.\n\nThey are brought to the utmost exactness of discipline; go through their evolutions and manoeuvres with a regularity and precision equal to, and not surpassed by European troops. In action they are brave and steady, and have been known to stand where Europeans have given way.\n\nTheir discipline puts them on a footing with European troops, with whom they are always ready to act in concert.\n\nTheir utility and services are evident: they secure to the company the internal good order and preservation of their territorial districts, which, though possible to be enforced with a strong hand by Europeans, requires numbers, and can only be conducted with that ease and address peculiar to the native forces of the country.\n\nThey are considered with respect in the eyes of the other natives, though they sufficiently, and with a good grace, feel and assert their own consequence. In large garrisons, where the duty is great, as Madras, Pondicherry, Trichinopoly, Vellore, &c., two or three battalions might be present together, exclusive of Europeans. If sent singly up the country, they are liable to be detached, sometimes by one or more companies being sent to a station dependent on the chief garrison or headquarters, otherwise they are dispersed through the districts, four or five together, with a non-commissioned officer (this is a part of the service which is called going on command), on hills, or in villages, to preserve order, convey intelligence, and assist the tahsildar, renter, or cutwall of the place, in cases of emergency. They also enforce the police, and prevent in such cases the country from being infested with thieves, which otherwise have combined, forming a banditti, to rob passengers and plunder cattle, of which there are so many instances upon record. As for such British officers in the company's service as are attached to battalions, they are obliged to follow the fortunes and destinations of their men, with their respective corps, leading a life often replete with adventures of a peculiar nature. An individual in such cases is frequently secluded from those of his own colour when up the country, or detached upon command, where in a frontier garrison or hill fort in the interior parts of India, none but natives are to be found. Here he might live as he pleases, being perfectly absolute within his jurisdiction. Such stations being lucrative, with management may produce great fortunes. Neither is the condition hard to a person conversant in the language of the country, or that of the Scapoys called Moors (which most officers in the company's service acquire); otherwise the lots of society is not compensated by other advantages, as you forget your own language, grow melancholy, and pass your days without comfort.\n\nThe peace establishment at Madras consists of 30 Scapoy battalions, but in time of war is augmented as occasion requires; or frequently each corps is strengthened by the addition of two companies, which are reduced again in time of peace, the officers remaining supernumeraries in the service. In garrison they are quartered in barracks; they live agreeably to the usage of the country, sleep on the ground on a mat or thin carpet. In their persons they are cleanly, but appear to best advantage in their uniform. Off duty they go as the other natives in poor circumstances; and have only a cloth round their middle and over their shoulders. As to the different casts, the Moormen or Mulmulmen affect pre-eminence, as coming into the country by conquest. In their persons they are rather robust, and in their tempers vindictive. Their religion and dress is distinct from the Hindoos, who are mild and passive in their temper, faithful, steady, and good soldiers. The Pariahs are inferior to the others, live under different circumstances, dwell in huts, and associate not on equal terms with the rest; they do all menial offices, are servants to Europeans, and think themselves happy when by them employed, though they are equally good Scapoys.\n\nHaving thus treated of the company's Scapoys, we shall observe that they are kindly attentive to their officers when often in circumstances requiring their assistance; are guilty of few vices; and have a strong attachment for those who have commanded them. That acute historian Dr Robertson has remarked, as a proof that the ingenuity of man has recourse in similar situations to the same expedients that the European powers, have, in forming the establishment of these native troops, adopted the same maxims, and, probably without knowing it, have modelled their battalions of Scapoys upon the same principles as Alexander the Great did his phalanx of Persians.\n\nSEARCH-WARRANT, in Law, a kind of general warrant issued by justices of peace or magistrates of towns for searching all suspected places for stolen goods. In Scotland this was often done formerly; and in some English law-books there are precedents requiring the constable to search all such suspected places as he and the party complaining shall think convenient; but such practice is condemned by Lord Hale, Mr Hawkins, and the best authorities both among the English and Scotch lawyers. However, in case of a complaint, and oath made of goods stolen, and that the party suspects that those goods are in a particular house, and shows the cause of such suspicion, the justice may grant a warrant to search not only that house but other suspected places; and to attach the goods, and the party in whose custody they are found, and bring them before him or some other justice, to give an account how he came by them, and to abide such order as to law shall appertain; which\nSEARCHER, an officer in the customs, whose business it is to search and examine ships outwards bound, if they have any prohibited goods on board, &c. (12 Car. II.). There are also searchers of leather, &c. See AIMAGER.\n\nSEARCHER, in ordnance, is an iron socket with branches, from four to eight in number, a little bent outwards, with small points at their ends; to this socket is fixed a wooden handle, from eight to twelve feet long, of about an inch and a quarter diameter. After the gun has been fired, this searcher is introduced into it, and turned round, in order to discover the cavities within. The distances of these cavities, if any be found, are then marked on the outside with chalk, when another searcher that has only one point, about which a mixture of wax and tallow is put, is introduced to take the impression of the holes; and if there be any hole, a quarter of an inch deep, or of any considerable length, the gun is rejected as unserviceable.\n\nSEARCLOTH, or CERECLOTH, in Surgery, a form of external remedy somewhat harder than an unguent, yet softer than an emplaster, though it is frequently used both for the one and the other. The cerelcloth is always supposed to have wax in its composition, which distinguishes and even denominates it. In effect, when a liniment or unguent has wax enough in it, it does not differ from a cerelcloth.\n\nSEASIN, in a ship, the name of a rope by which the boat rides by the ship's side when in harbour, &c.\n\nSEASONING, the first illness to which persons habituated to colder climates are subject on their arrival in the West Indies. This seasoning, unless they live very temperately, or are in a proper habit of body (though some people are unelected for many months), seldom suffers them to remain long before it makes its appearance in some mode or other; particularly if at first they expose themselves in a shower of rain, or too long in the sun, or in the night-air; or when the body is much heated, if they drink large draughts of cold liquors, or bathe in cold water; or use much exercise; or commit excess in drinking wine or spirits; or by heating the body and inflaming the blood; or by subjecting themselves to any cause that may suddenly check perspiration, which at first is generally excessive.\n\nSome people, from a favourable state of body, have no seasoning. Thin people, and very young people, are most likely to escape it. Women generally do from their temperance, and perhaps their menstruation contributes to their security; indeed hot climates are favourable to the delicacy of their habits, and suitable to their modes of life. Some escape by great regularity of living; some, by the breaking out of the rash, called the prickly heat; some by a great degree of perspiration; and some by observing a cooling regimen. The disorders are various that constitute this seasoning of new-comers as they are called; depending on age, constitution, and habit of body. But all seasoning diseases are of the inflammatory kind; and yield to antiphlogistic treatment proportioned to their violence. When all precaution to guard against sickness has failed, and prudence proved abortive to new-comers, they will have this comfort at least for their pains, that their disorders will seldom be severe or expensive, and will generally have a speedy termination; and that their seasoning, as it is emphatically called, will be removed by bleeding, a dose of salts, rest, and a cooling regimen.\n\nSEASONING of Timber.

It is seated at the foot of a mountain; and the harbour secured by two moles, and a narrow entrance for the ships. The town is surrounded with a double wall, and to the sea-side is fortified with battions and half moons. The streets are long, broad, and straight, and paved with white flagstones. At the top of the mountain is a citadel, with a garrison well furnished with cannon. The town carries on a considerable trade, the greatest part of which consists of iron and steel, which some reckon to be the best in Europe. They also deal in wood, which comes from Old Castile. W. Long. 1. 59. N. Lat. 43. 23.—The capital of Brazil in South America is likewise called Sebastien.\n\nSEBASTIANO, called Del Piombo, from an office in the lead mines given him by Pope Clement VII., was an eminent Venetian painter, born in 1485. He was first a disciple of old Giovanni Bellino; continued his studies under Giorgione; and having attained an excellent manner of colouring, went to Rome, where he intimated himself into the favour of Michael Angelo. He has the name of being the first who invented the art of preparing platter-walls for oil-painting; but was so slow and lazy in his work, that other hands were often employed to finish what he began. He died in 1547.\n\nSEBESTEN. See Cordia, Botany Index.\n\nSEBUAI, a sect among the ancient Samaritans, whom St Epiphanius accuses of changing the time expressed in the law, for the celebration of the great annual feasts of the Jews.\nSEBURAI, SEBURAI, a name which the Jews give to such of their rabbins or doctors as lived and taught some time after the finishing of the Talmud.\n\nSECACUL, in the Materia Medica of the ancients, a name given by Avicenna, Serapion, and others, to a root which was like ginger, and was brought from the East Indies, and used as a provocative to venery. The interpreters of their works have rendered this word *iringo*; and hence some have supposed that our *eryngium* or *eryngo* was the root meant by it; but this does not appear to be the case on a strict inquiry, and there is some reason to believe that the famous root, at this time called *gingong*, was what they meant.\n\nSECALE, Rye, a genus of plants belonging to the triandria clasps; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Graminae. See BOTANY and AGRICULTURE Index.\n\nThe cereale, or common rye, has glumes with rough fringes. It is a native of the island of Candia, was introduced into England many ages ago, and is the only species of rye cultivated in this kingdom. There are, however, two varieties, the winter and spring rye.\n\nThe winter rye, which is larger in the grain than the spring rye, is sown in autumn at the same time with wheat, and sometimes mixed with it; but as the rye ripens sooner than the wheat, this method must be very exceptionable. The spring rye is sown along with the oats, and usually ripens as soon as the winter rye; but the grain produced is lighter, and it is therefore seldom sown except where the autumnal crop has failed.\n\nRye is commonly sown on poor, dry, limestone, or sandy soils, where wheat will not thrive. By continuing to sow it on such a soil for two or three years, it will at length ripen a month earlier than that which has been raised for years on strong cold ground.\n\nRye is commonly used for bread either alone or mixed with wheat. This mixture is called *melin*, and was formerly a very common crop in some parts of Britain. Mr Marshall tells us, that the farmers in Yorkshire believe that this mixed crop is never affected by mildew, and that a small quantity of rye sown among wheat will prevent this destructive disease. Rye is much used for bread in some parts of Sweden and Norway by the poor people. About a century ago rye-bread was also much used in England; but being made of a black kind of rye, it was of the same colour, clammy, very detergent, and consequently not so nourishing as wheat.\n\nRye is subject to a disease which the French call *ergot*, and the English *horned rye*; which sometimes happens when a very hot summer succeeds a rainy spring. According to Tiffot, horned rye is such as suffers an irregular vegetation in the middle substance between the grain and the leaf, producing an excrescence of a brownish colour, about an inch and a half long, and two-tenths of an inch broad. Bread made of this kind of rye has a nauseous acid taste, and produces spasmodic and gangrenous disorders. In 1596, an epidemic disease prevailed in Hesse, which the physicians ascribed to bread made of horned rye. Some, we are told, were seized with an epilepsy, and these seldom ever recovered; others became lunatic, and continued stupid the rest of their lives: those who apparently recovered had annual returns of their disorder in January and February; and the disease was said to be contagious at least in a certain degree. The facts which we have now mentioned are taken from a work of Tiffot, which was never printed. The same disease was occasioned by the use of this bread in several parts of the continent in the years 1648, 1675, 1702, 1716, 1722, and 1736; and has been very minutely described by Hoffman, A. O. Goedicke, Vater Burghart, and J. A. Sink.\n\nIn the year 1709, one fourth part of all the rye raised in the province of Salonia in France was horned, and the surgeon to the hospital of Orleans had no less than 500 patients under his care that were disordered by eating it: They were called *ergots*, from *ergot* (A), the French name for horned rye; they consisted chiefly of men and boys, the number of women and girls being very small. The first symptom was a kind of drunkenness, then the local disorder began in the toes, and thence extended sometimes to the thigh, and the trunk itself, even after amputation, which is a good argument against that operation before the gangrene is stopped.\n\nIn the year 1710, the celebrated Fontenelle describes a case in the History of the Academy of Sciences of France, which exactly resembles that of the poor family at Wattiflam. A peasant at Blois, who had eaten horned rye in bread, was seized with a mortification which first caused all the toes of one foot to fall off, then the toes of the other, afterwards the remainder of the feet, and, lastly, it ate off the flesh of both his legs and thighs, leaving the bones bare.\n\nHorned rye is not only hurtful to man, but to other animals; it has been known to destroy even the flies that settled upon it; sheep, dogs, deer, geese, ducks, swine, and poultry, that were fed with it for experiment, died miserably, some convulsed, others mortified and ulcerated.\n\nSECANT, in Geometry, a line that cuts another or divides it into parts. The secant of a circle is a line drawn from the circumference on one side to a point without the circumference on the other; and it is demonstrated by geometers, that that of several secants drawn to the same point, that is the longest which passes through the centre of the circle. The portions, however, of these several secants that are without the circle are so much the greater as they recede from the centre, and the least external portion is of that secant which passes through it.\n\nSECANT, in Trigonometry, denotes a right line drawn from the centre of a circle, which, cutting the circumference, proceeds till it meets with a tangent to the same circle. See GEOMETRY.\n\nLine of SECANTS, one of those lines or scales which are usually put upon sectors. See SECTOR, n° 12.\n\nSECEDERS, a numerous body of Presbyterians in Scotland, who have withdrawn from the communion of the established church. As they take up their ground\n\n(A) Ergot is French for a cock's spur, and horned rye was called ergot from the resemblance of its excrescence to that part.\nSeceders, ground upon the establishment of religion from 1638 to 1650, which they hold to be the purest period of the Scottish church, we shall introduce our account of them by a short view of ecclesiastical history from that period to the era of their secession. With our usual candour and impartiality we mean to give a fair statement of those events with which, as they lay, their secession is connected.\n\nJames I., having for some time previous to his death entertained a wish to form the church of Scotland as much as possible upon the model of that in England, his son Charles, with the assistance of Archbishop Laud, endeavoured to carry the design into execution, by establishing canons for ecclesiastical discipline, and introducing a liturgy into the public service of the church. Numbers of the clergy and laity of all ranks took the alarm at what they considered to be a bold and dangerous innovation; and after frequent applications to the throne, they at last obtained the royal proclamation for a free parliament and general assembly. The assembly met in 1638, and began their labours with a repeal of all the acts of the six preceding parliaments, which had favoured the designs of James. They condemned the liturgy, together with every branch of the hierarchy. They cited all the Scottish bishops to their bar; and after having excommunicated nine of them, and deposed five from their episcopal office, they restored kirk-lefsions, presbyteries, and synods provincial as well as national. See Presbyterians.\n\nThese proceedings were ratified by the parliament which met in 1640. The law of patronage was in full force for several years after this period; yet great care was taken that no minister should be obtruded on the Christian people contrary to their inclinations; and in 1649 it was abolished as an oppressive grievance.\n\nThe restoration of Charles II. in 1660 changed the face of affairs in the church of Scotland. All that the general assembly had done from 1638 to 1650 was rendered null and void, the covenants were pronounced to be unlawful, episcopacy was restored, and the king was declared to be the supreme head of the church in all causes civil and ecclesiastical. During this period the Presbyterians were subjected to fines and imprisonment, while numbers of them were publicly executed for their adherence to their political and religious tenets.\n\nThe Revolution in 1688 gave a different turn to the affairs of the church. The first parliament which met after that event, abolished prelacy and the king's supremacy in ecclesiastical affairs. They ratified the Westminster Confession of Faith, together with the Presbyterian form of church-government and discipline, \"as agreeable to the word of God, and most conducive to the advancement of true piety and godliness, and the establishment of peace and tranquillity within these realms.\" That same parliament abolished patronage, and lodged the election of ministers in the hands of heritors and elders, with the consent of the congregation.\n\nIn the reign of Queen Anne the true Protestant religion was ratified and established, together with the Presbyterian form of church-government and discipline; and the unalterable continuance of both was declared to be an essential condition of the union of the two kingdoms in all time coming. In 1712 the law respecting patronage was revived, in resentment, it has been said, of that warm attachment which the church of Scotland Seceders discovered to the family of Hanover; but the severity of that law was greatly mitigated by the first parliament of George I. (stat. 3), by which it is enacted, that, if the prelate do not signify his acceptance, the presentation shall become void and null in law. The church, however, did not avail herself of this statute; and an event which happened not many years afterwards gave rise to the secession.\n\nIn 1732 more than 40 ministers presented an address to the general assembly, specifying in a variety of instances what they considered to be great defections from the established constitution of the church, and craving a redress of these grievances. A petition to the same effect, subscribed by several hundreds of elders and private Christians, was offered at the same time; but the assembly refused a hearing to both, and enacted, that the election of ministers to vacant charges, where an accepted presentation did not take place, should be competent only to a conjunct meeting of elders and heritors, being Protestants. To this act many objections were made by numbers of ministers and private Christians. They asserted that more than 30 to one in every parish were not possessed of landed property, and were on that account deprived of what they deemed their natural right to choose their own pastors. It was also said, that this act was extremely prejudicial to the honour and interest of the church, as well as to the edification of the people; and in fine, that it was directly contrary to the appointment of Jesus Christ, and the practice of the apostles, when they filled up the first vacancy in the apostolic college, and appointed the election of deacons and elders in the primitive church. Many of those also who were thought to be the best friends of the church, expressed their fears that this act would have a tendency to overturn the ecclesiastical constitution which was established at the Revolution.\n\nMr Ebenezer Erskine, minister at Stirling, distinguished himself by a bold and determined opposition to pose the measures of the assembly in 1732. Being at that time moderator of the synod of Perth and Stirling, he opened the meeting at Perth with a sermon from Psalm cxviii. 22, \"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head stone of the corner.\" In the course of his sermon he remonstrated with no small degree of freedom against the act of the preceding assembly with regard to the settlement of ministers, and alleged that it was contrary to the word of God and the established constitution of the church. A formal complaint was lodged against him for uttering several offensive expressions in his sermon before the synod. Many of the members declared that they heard him utter nothing but found and seasonable doctrine; but his accusers insisting on their complaint, obtained an appointment of a committee of synod to collect what were called the offensive expressions, and to lay them before the next diet in writing. This was done accordingly; and Mr Erskine gave in his answers to every article of the complaint. After three days warm reasoning on this affair, the synod by a majority of six found him censurable; against which sentence he protested, and appealed to the next general assembly. When the assembly met in May 1733, it affirmed the sentence of others are the synod, and appointed Mr Erskine to be rebuked and censured,\nSeceders, and admonished from the chair. Upon which he protested, that, as the assembly had found him censurable, and had rebuked him for doing what he conceived to be agreeable to the word of God and the standards of the church, he should be at liberty to preach the same truths, and to testify against the same or similar evils, on every proper occasion. To this protest Messrs William Wilson minister at Perth, Alexander Moncrief minister at Abernethy, and James Fisher minister at Kinclaven, gave in a written adherence, under the form of instrument; and these four withdrew, intending to return to their respective charges, and act agreeably to their protest whenever they should have an opportunity. Had the affair relented here, there never would have been a secession; but the assembly resolving to carry on the process, cited them by their officer to appear next day. They obeyed the citation; and a committee was appointed to retire with them, in order to persuade them to withdraw their protest. The committee having reported that they still adhered to their protest, the assembly ordered them to appear before the commission in August following and retract their protest; and if they should not comply and testify their sorrow for their conduct, the commission was empowered to suspend them from the exercise of their ministry, with certification that if they should act contrary to said sentence, the commission should proceed to an higher censure.\n\nThe commission met in August accordingly; and the four ministers still adhering to their protest, were suspended from the exercise of their office, and cited to the next meeting of the commission in November following. From this sentence several ministers and elders, members of the commission, dissented. The commission met in November, and the suspended ministers appeared. Addresses, representations, and letters from several synods and presbyteries, relative to the business now before the commission, were received and read. The synods of Dumfries, Murray, Ross, Angus and Mearns, Perth and Stirling, craved that the commission would delay proceeding to a higher censure. The synods of Galloway and Fife, as also the presbytery of Dornoch, addressed the commission for lenity, tenderness, and forbearance, towards the suspended ministers; and the presbytery of Aberdeen represented, that in their judgement, the sentence of suspension inflicted on the foresaid ministers was too high, and that it was a stretch of ecclesiastical authority. Many members of the commission reasoned in the same manner, and alleged that the act and sentence of last assembly did not oblige them to proceed to an higher censure at this meeting of the commission. The question, however, was put, Proceed to an higher censure, or not? and the votes being numbered, were found equal on both sides: upon which Mr John Goldie the moderator gave his casting vote to proceed to a higher censure; which stands in their minutes in these words: \"The commission did and hereby do loose the relation of Mr Ebenezer Erskine minister at Stirling, Mr William Wilson minister at Perth, Mr Alexander Moncrief minister at Abernethy, and Mr James Fisher minister at Kinclaven, to their respective charges, and declare them no longer ministers of this church; and do hereby prohibit all ministers of this church to employ them, or any of them, in any ministerial function. And the commission do declare the churches of the said ministers vacant from and after the date of this sentence.\"\n\nThis sentence being intimated to them, they protested, that their ministerial office and relation to their respective charges should be held as valid as if no such sentence had passed; and that they were now obliged to make a secession from the prevailing party in the ecclesiastical courts; and that it shall be lawful and warrantable for them to preach the gospel, and discharge every branch of the pastoral office, according to the word of God and the established principles of the church of Scotland. Mr Ralph Erskine minister at Dunfermline, Mr Thomas Blair minister at Orkney, Mr John McLaren minister at Edinburgh, Mr John Currie minister at Kingliston, Mr James Wardlaw minister at Dunfermline, and Mr Thomas Nairn minister at Abbotshall, protested against the sentence of the commission, and that it should be lawful for them to complain of it to any subsequent general assembly of the church.\n\nThe secession properly commenced at this date. And accordingly the ejected ministers declared in their protest that they were laid under the disagreeable necessity of seceding, not from the principles and constitution of the church of Scotland, to which, they said, they faithfully adhered, but from the present church-courts, which had thrown them out from ministerial communion. The assembly, however, which met in May 1734 did so far modify the above sentence, that they empowered the synod of Perth and Stirling to receive the ejected ministers into the communion of the church, and restore them to their respective charges; but with this express direction, \"that the said synod should not take upon them to judge of the legality or formality of the former procedure of the church judicatories in relation to this affair, or either approve or censure the same.\" As this appointment neither condemned the act of the preceding assembly nor the conduct of the commission, the seceding ministers considered it to be rather an act of grace than of justice, and therefore they said they could not return to the church-courts upon this ground; and they published to the world the reasons of their refusal, and the terms upon which they were willing to return to the communion of the established church. They now erected themselves into an ecclesiastical court, which they called the Associated Presbytery, and preached occasionally to numbers of the people who joined them in different parts of the country. They also published what they called an Act, Declaration, and Testimony, to the doctrine, worship, government, and discipline of the church of Scotland, and against several infirmities, as they said, of defection from these, both in former and in the present times. Some time after this several ministers of the established church joined them, and the Associated Presbytery now consisted of eight ministers. But the general assembly which met in 1738 finding that the number of Seceders was much increased, ordered the eight ministers to be served with a libel, and to be cited to the next meeting of the assembly in 1739. They now appeared at the bar as a constituted presbytery, and having formally declined the assembly's authority, they immediately withdrew. The assembly then deposed them from the office of the ministry; which, however, they continued to exercise in their respective congregations, who still adhered to them, and erected meeting houses, where they preached till their livings;\nSeceders their death. Mr James Fisher, the last survivor of them, was, by an unanimous call in 1747, translated from Kinlochven to Glasgow, where he continued in the exercise of his ministry among a numerous congregation, respected by all ranks in that large city, and died in 1775 much regretted by his people and friends. In 1745 the seceding ministers were become so numerous, that they were erected into three different presbyteries, under one synod, when a very unprofitable dispute divided them into two parties.\n\nThe burgess oath in some of the royal boroughs of Scotland contains the following clause: \"I profess and allow with my heart the true religion professed within this realm, and authorized by the laws thereof. I will abide at and defend the same to my life's end, renouncing the Romish religion called Papistry.\" Messrs Ebenezer and Ralph Erskine, James Fisher, and others, affirmed that this clause was no way contrary to the principles on which the secession was formed, and that therefore every Seceder might lawfully swear it. Messrs Alexander Moncrief, Thomas Mair, Adam Gib, and others, contended on the other hand that the swearing of the above clause was a virtual renunciation of their testimony. And this controversy was so keenly agitated, that they split into two different parties, and now met in different synods. Those of them who assert the lawfulness of swearing the burgess oath are called Burghers, and the other party who condemn it are called Antiburgher Seceders. Each party claiming to itself the lawful constitution of the Associate Synod, the Antiburghers, after several previous steps, excommunicated the Burghers on the ground of their sin and of their contumacy in it. This rupture took place in 1747, since which period no attempts to effect a reunion have been successful. They remain under the jurisdiction of different synods, and hold separate communion, although much of their former hostility has been laid aside. The Antiburghers consider the Burghers as too lax and not sufficiently steadfast to their testimony. The Burghers on the other hand contend that the Antiburghers are too rigid, in that they have introduced new terms of communion into the society. The Antiburghers having adopted ideas with regard to what they call covenanting, which the Burghers never approved (A), have been in use of renewing in their several congregations the Scottish Covenant, by causing their people formally to swear to maintain it. In other respects the differences between the two parties are not material. The Antiburghers are most numerous on the north of the Tay, and the Burghers on the south.\n\nWhat follows in this article is a further account of those who are commonly called the Burgher Seceders, the Burghers have a greater number of people in their communion than the Antiburghers, and for some years past they have greatly increased in the southern and western districts of Scotland. As there were among them from the commencement of their secession several students who had been educated at one or other of the universities, they appointed one of their ministers to give lectures in theology, and an up candidates for the ministry. Messrs William Willson minister at Perth and Alexander Moncrief minister at Abernethy were their professors of theology before their separation from the Antiburghers.\n\nSince that period Mr Ebenezer Erskine minister at Stirling, Mr James Fisher minister at Glasgow, Mr John Swanston minister at Kinross, and Mr John Brown minister at Haddington, have succeeded each other in this office. At present Mr George Lawson minister at Selkirk is their professor of theology, and there are between thirty and forty students who attend his lectures annually. The number of their ministers is about an hundred, and each of their congregations contains from two hundred and fifty to three thousand persons; and there are among them at present more than twenty vacant charges. Where a congregation is very numerous, as in Stirling, Dunfermline, and Perth, it is formed into a collegiate charge, and provided with two ministers. They are erected into six different presbyteries, united in one general synod, which commonly meets at Edinburgh in May and September (B). They have also a synod in Ireland composed of three or four different presbyteries. They are legally tolerated in Ireland; and government some years ago granted 300l. per annum, and of late an additional 500l., which, when divided among them, affords to each minister about 20l. over and above the stipend which he receives from his hearers. There have besides a presbytery in Nova Scotia; and some years ago, it is said, that the Burgher and the Antiburgher ministers residing in the United States formed a coalition and joined in a general synod, which they call the Synod of New York and Pennsylvania. They all preach the doctrines contained in the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms, as they believe these to be founded on the sacred scriptures. They catechise their hearers publicly, and visit them from house to house once every year.\n\n(A) This is the account which the Burghers give of their own notions respecting the covenant. One of the most enlightened of their opponents, however, assures us that they acknowledge covenanting to be a moral duty, and that the solemn vows of our ancestors are obligatory. But since the breach in the synod they have never engaged in this work; giving, as their reason, that this is not the proper season.\n\n(B) The constitution of the Antiburgher church differs very little from that of the Burghers. The supreme court among them is denominated The General Associate Synod, having under its jurisdiction three provincial synods in Scotland and one in Ireland. In the former country there are eleven presbyteries; in the latter, four. They have a few congregations in England, and a presbytery in connection with them in North America. The number of ministers belonging to the general synod is a hundred and thirty-seven; and in Scotland there are nineteen vacancies. They, as well as the Burgher Seceders, have a professor of theology, whose lectures every candidate for the office of a preacher is obliged to attend, we have been told, for no less than five or six sessions! Surely the session must be of short duration.\nThey will not give the Lord's supper to those who are ignorant of the principles of the gospel, nor to such as are scandalous and immoral in their lives. They condemn private baptism, nor will they admit those who are grossly ignorant and profane to be sponsors for their children. Believing that the people have a natural right to choose their own pastors, the settlement of their ministers always proceeds upon a popular election; and the candidate who is elected by the majority is ordained among them. Convinced that the charge of souls is a trust of the greatest importance, they carefully watch over the morals of their students, and direct them to such a course of reading and study as they judge most proper to qualify them for the profitable discharge of the pastoral duties. At the ordination of their ministers they use a formula of the same kind with that of the established church, which their ministers are bound to subscribe when called to it; and if any of them teach doctrines contrary to the Scriptures or the Westminster Confession of Faith, they are sure of being thrown out of their communion. By this means uniformity of sentiment is preserved among them; nor has any of their ministers, excepting one, been prosecuted for error in doctrine since the commencement of their secession.\n\nThey believe that the holy scriptures are the sole criterion of truth, and the only rule to direct mankind to glorify and enjoy God, the chief and eternal good; and that \"the Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all the decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scriptures.\" They are fully persuaded, however, that the standards of public authority in the church of Scotland exhibit a just and consistent view of the meaning and design of the holy scriptures with regard to doctrine, worship, government, and discipline; and they in so far differ from the dissenters in England, in that they hold these standards to be not only articles of peace and a test of orthodoxy, but as a bond of union and fellowship. They consider a simple declaration of adherence to the scriptures as too equivocal a proof of unity in sentiment, because Arians, Socinians, and Arminians, make such a confession of their faith, while they retain sentiments which they (the Seceders) apprehend are subversive of the great doctrines of the gospel. They believe that Jesus Christ is the only King and Head of the Church, which is his body; that it is his sole prerogative to enact laws for the government of his kingdom, which is not of this world; and that the church is not possessed of a legislative, but only of an executive power, to be exercised in explaining and applying to their proper objects and ends those laws which Christ hath published in the scriptures. Those doctrines which they teach relative to faith and practice are exhibited at great length in an explanation of the Westminster Assembly's Shorter Catechism, by way of question and answer, in two volumes, composed chiefly by Mr James Fisher late of Glasgow, and published by desire of their synod.\n\nFor these 50 years past, the grounds of their secession, they allege, have been greatly enlarged by the public administrations of the established church, and particularly by the uniform execution of the law respecting patronage, which, they say, has obliged many thousands of private Christians to withdraw from the parish-churches and join their society.\n\nIt is certain, however, that their number has rapidly increased of late, especially in the large cities of the kingdom. They have three different congregations in Edinburgh, two in Glasgow, and two in London, besides several others in the north of England. In most of their congregations they celebrate the Lord's supper twice in the year, and they catechise their young people concerning their knowledge of the principles of religion previously to their admission to that sacrament. When any of them fall into the sin of fornication or adultery, the scandal is regularly purged according to the form of process in the established church; and those of the delinquents who do not submit to adequate censure are publicly declared to be fugitives from discipline, and are expelled the society. They never accept a sum of money as a commutation for the offence. They condemn all clandestine and irregular marriages, nor will they marry any persons unless they have been proclaimed in the parish-church on two different Lord's days at least.\n\nWhen they separated from the established church, and politically they remained firm in their attachment to the state; and they were not many years formed into a distinct society, when they expelled from their communion a Mr Thomas Nairn minister at Kirkcaldy, who had taught doctrines inimical to the civil government of the nation. In 1745 there was not one of their number who joined the pretender to the British crown. They are still of the same sentiments; and in their public assemblies they always pray for our sovereign King George, with the royal family, and for all who are in authority under them. They are so far from wishing the overthrow of the present civil government, that when the nation was lately in danger of being thrown into a fermentation by the circulation of inflammatory and seditious writings, they warmly recommended peace and order in society. The same remarks, we believe, are equally applicable to the Antiburgher seceders. No legal disqualifications, as in the case of the dissenters in England, exclude them from any place of public trust in the municipal government of the country; and some of them are frequently in the magistracy of the royal boroughs. They are not, however, legally tolerated, but are supported by the mildness of administration and the liberal spirit of the times. Avowing their adherence to the doctrines contained in the public standards of the church of Scotland, together with the presbyterian form of government, from which they never intended to secede, they deny that they are either schismatics or sectaries, as they have been frequently called; and when they withdrew from the ecclesiastical courts, they did not, they say, constitute a church of their own, different from the national church, but profess to be a part of that church, endeavouring to hold by her reformed principles, in opposition to those deviations from them which they have specified in their Act and Testimony. Most of them live in habits of friendship and intimacy with their brethren of the establishment, and they profess an affectionate regard for all those of every denomination who love Jesus Christ in sincerity and truth. In the late re-exhibition of their testimony, they have declared to the world, that, were the grounds of their secession happily removed, they would account it one of the most singular felicities of their moderation.\ntheir time to return with pleasure to the communion of the established church.\n\n**SECHIUM**, a genus of plants belonging to the monoeia class; and in the natural method ranking under the 34th order, *Cucurbitaceae*.

He was a good linguist, learned in law, history, and divinity; and is said to have been a tolerable painter and engraver. He was honourably employed by several of the German princes; and died counsellor of state to Frederic III., elector of Brandenburg, and chancellor of the university of Halle, in 1692.

His father was a Protestant dissenting, a pious, virtuous, and sensible man; who, having a small paternal fortune, followed no profession. His mother was the daughter of Mr Brough, a substantial gentleman farmer of Shelton in the same county. He received his education at several private schools and academies in the country, being obliged, by various accidents, frequently to change his masters.\n\nNotwithstanding this disadvantage, he had at the age of 19 not only made considerable progress in Greek and Latin, and read the best writers in both languages, but had acquired a knowledge of French, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac; had learned geography, logic, algebra, geometry, conic sections, and gone through a course of lectures on Jewish antiquities and other points, preparatory to the critical study of the Bible. He had been destined by his father for orders among the Dissenters. With this view, during the latter years of his education, his studies were chiefly turned towards divinity, in which he had made such quick advances, that by the time he was 23 he had carefully read over a great part of the Scriptures, particularly the New Testament, in the original, and the best comments upon it; Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History, The Apolitical Fathers, Whitton's Primitive Christianity, and the principal writers for and against Ministerial and Lay Conformity.—But though the result of these inquiries was a well-grounded belief of the Christian revelation, yet not being at that time able to decide on some arbitrary speculative doctrines, nor to determine absolutely what communion he should embrace; he resolved, like a wise and honest man, to pursue some profession, which should leave him at liberty to weigh those things more maturely in his thoughts, and not oblige him to declare or teach publicly opinions which were not yet thoroughly settled in his own mind.\n\nIn 1716, therefore, he applied himself to the study of physic, and after gaining all the medical knowledge he could, by reading the usual preparatory books, and attending the best lectures during that and the following winter in London, in order to improve himself farther, in January 1718-19 he went to Paris. There he lodged in the same house with the famous anatomist Mr Winslow, whose lectures he attended, as he did those of the materia medica, chemistry, and botany, at the king's gardens. He saw the operations of surgery at the Hôtel Dieu, and attended also for some time M. Grégoire, the accoucheur, but without any design of ever practising that or any other branch of surgery. Here he became acquainted with Mr Martin Benson, afterwards bishop of Gloucester, one of the most agreeable and virtuous men of his time; with whom he quickly became much connected, and not many years after was united to him by the strictest bonds of affinity as well as affection.\n\nDuring the whole of Mr Secker's continuance at Paris, he kept up a constant correspondence with Mr Joseph Butler, afterwards bishop of Durham, with whom he became acquainted at the academy of one Mr Jones, kept first at Gloucester, and afterward at Tewkesbury, Mr Butler having been appointed preacher at the Rolls on the recommendation of Dr Clarke and Mr Edward Talbot, son to Bishop Taibot, he now took occasion to mention his friend Mr Secker, without Secker's knowledge, to Mr Talbot, who promised, in case he chose to take orders in the church of England, to engage the bishop his father to provide for him. This was communicated to Mr Secker in a letter from Mr Butler about the beginning of May 1720. He had not at that time come to any resolution of quitting the study of physic; but he began to foresee many obstacles to his pursuing that profession; and having never discontinued his application to theology, his former difficulties both with regard to conformity and some other doubtful points had gradually lessened, as his judgement became stronger, and his reading and knowledge more extensive. It appears also from two of his letters still in being, written from Paris to a friend in England, (both of them prior to the date of Mr Butler's above mentioned), that he was greatly dissatisfied with the divisions and disturbances which at that particular period prevailed among the Dissenters.\n\nIn this state of mind Mr Butler's unexpected proposal found him; which he was therefore very well disposed to take into consideration; and after deliberating on the subject of such a change for upwards of two months, he resolved at length to embrace the offer, and for that purpose quitted France about the beginning of August 1720.\n\nOn his arrival in England, he was introduced to Mr Talbot, with whom he cultivated a close acquaintance; but it was unfortunately of very short duration; for in the month of December that gentleman died of the smallpox. This was a great shock to all his friends, who had justly conceived the highest expectations of him; but especially to an amiable lady whom he had lately married, and who was very near sinking under so sudden and grievous a stroke. Mr Secker, beside sharing largely in the common grief, had peculiar reason to lament an accident that seemed to put an end to all his hopes; but he had taken his resolution, and he determined to persevere. It was some encouragement to him to find that Mr Talbot had, on his deathbed, recommended him, together with Mr Benson and Mr Butler, to his father's notice. Thus did that excellent young man (for he was but 29 when he died), by his nice discernment of characters, and his considerate good nature, provide most effectually, in a few solemn moments, for the welfare of that church from which he himself was so prematurely snatched away; and at the fame...\nfame time raised up, when he least thought of it, the truest friend and protector to his wife and unborn daughter; who afterwards found in Mr Secker all that tender care and affluence which they could have hoped for from the nearest relation.\n\nIt being judged necessary by Mr Secker's friends that he should have a degree at Oxford; and having been informed, that if he should previously take the degree of Doctor in Physic at Leyden, it would probably help him in obtaining the other, he went over and took his degree there in March 1721: and, as part of his exercise for it, he composed and printed a dissertation de Medicina Statica, which is still extant, and is thought by the gentlemen of that profession to be a sensible and learned performance.\n\nIn April of the same year, he entered himself a gentleman commoner of Exeter college, Oxford; after which he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts, in consequence of the chancellor's recommendatory letter to the convocation.\n\nHe now spent a considerable part of his time in London, where he quickly gained the esteem of some of the most learned and ingenious men of those days, particularly of Dr Clarke, rector of St James's, and the celebrated Dean Berkeley, afterwards bishop of Cloyne, with whom he every day became more delighted, and more closely connected. He paid frequent visits of gratitude and friendship to Mrs Talbot, widow of Mr Edward Talbot, by whom she had a daughter five months after his decease. With her lived Mrs Catherine Benson, sister to Bishop Benson, whom in many respects she greatly resembled. She had been for several years Mrs Talbot's inseparable companion, and was of unspeakable service to her at the time of her husband's death, by exerting all her courage, activity, and good sense (of which she possessed a large share), to support her friend under so great an affliction, and by afterwards attending her sickly infant with the utmost care and tenderness, to which, under Providence, was owing the preservation of a very valuable life.\n\nBishop Talbot being in 1721 appointed to the see of Durham, Mr Secker was in 1722 ordained deacon by him in St James's church, and priest not long after in the same place, where he preached his first sermon March 28, 1723. The bishop's domestic chaplain at that time was Dr Rundle, a man of warm fancy and very brilliant conversation, but apt sometimes to be carried by the vivacity of his wit into indelicacy and ludicrous expressions, which created him enemies, and, on one occasion, produced disagreeable consequences.—With him Mr Secker was soon after affiliated in the bishop's family, and both taken down by his lordship to Durham in July 1723.\n\nIn the following year the bishop gave Mr Secker the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring. This preferment putting it in his power to fix himself in the world, in a manner agreeable to his inclinations, he soon after made a proposal of marriage to Mrs Benson; which being accepted, they were married by Bishop Talbot in 1725. At the earnest request of both, Mrs Talbot and her daughter consented to live with them, and the two families from that time became one.\n\nAbout this time Bishop Talbot also gave preferments to Mr Butler and Mr Benson, whose rise and progress in the church is here interwoven with the history of Mr Secker. In the winter of 1725-6, Mr Butler first published his incomparable sermons; on which, as Dr Beilby Porteous and Dr Stinton inform us, Mr Secker took pains to render the style more familiar, and the author's meaning more obvious: yet they were at last by many called obscure. Mr Secker gave his friend the same affluence in that noble work the Analogy of Religion, &c.\n\nHe now gave up all the time he possibly could to his residence at Houghton, applying himself with alacrity to all the duties of a country clergyman, and supporting that useful and respectable character throughout with the strictest propriety. He omitted nothing which he thought would be of use to the souls and bodies of the people entrusted to his care. He brought down his conversation and his sermons to the level of their understandings; he visited them in private, he catechised the young and ignorant, he received his country neighbours and tenants very kindly and hospitably, and was of great service to the poorer sort of them by his skill in physic, which was the only use he ever made of it. Though this place was in a very remote part of the world, yet the solitude of it perfectly suited his studious disposition, and the income arising from it bounded his ambition. Here he would have been content to live and die; here, as he has often been heard to declare, he spent some of the happiest hours of his life; and it was no thought or choice of his own that removed him to a higher and more conspicuous situation; but Mrs Secker's health, which now began to decline, and was thought to be injured by the dampness of the situation, obliged him to think of exchanging it for a more healthy one. Accordingly, an exchange was made through the friendly interposition of Mr Benson (who generously sacrificed his own interest on this occasion, by relinquishing a prebend of his own to serve his friend) with Dr Finney, prebendary of Durham, and rector of Ryton; and Mr Secker was instituted to Ryton and the prebend June 3, 1727. For the two following years he lived chiefly at Durham, going every week to officiate at Ryton, and spending there two or three months together in the summer.\n\nIn July 1732 he was appointed chaplain to the king; for which favour he was indebted to Dr Sherlock, who having heard him preach at Bath, had conceived the highest opinion of his abilities, and thought them well worthy of being brought forward into public notice. From that time an intimacy commenced between them, and he received from that great prelate many solid proofs of esteem and friendship.\n\nHis month of waiting at St James's happened to be August, and on Sunday the 27th of that month he preached before the queen, the king being then abroad. A few days after, her majesty sent for him into her closet, and held a long conversation with him; in the course of which he took an opportunity of mentioning to her his friend Mr Butler. He also, not long after this, on Mr Talbot's being made lord chancellor, found means to have Mr Butler effectually recommended to him for his chaplain. The queen also appointed him clerk of her closet; from whence he rose, as his talents became more known, to those high dignities which he afterwards attained.\n\nMr Secker now began to have a public character, and stood high in the estimation of those who were allowed\nlowed to be the best judges of merit; he had already given proofs of abilities that plainly indicated the eminence to which he must one day rise, as a preacher and a divine; and it was not long before an opportunity offered of placing him in an advantageous point of view. Dr Tyrwhitt, who succeeded Dr Clarke as rector of St James's in 1729, found that preaching in so large a church endangered his health. Bishop Gibbon, therefore, his father-in-law, proposed to the crown that he should be made relictary of St Paul's, and that Mr Secker should succeed him in the rectory. This arrangement was so acceptable to those in power, that it took place without any difficulty. Mr Secker was instituted rector the 18th of May 1733; and in the beginning of July went to Oxford to take his degree of Doctor of Laws, not being of sufficient standing for that of divinity. On this occasion it was that he preached his celebrated Act Sermon, on the advantages and duties of academical education, which was universally allowed to be a masterpiece of sound reasoning and just composition: it was printed at the desire of the heads of houses, and quickly passed through several editions. It is now to be found in the second collection of Occasional Sermons, published by himself in 1766.\n\nIt was thought that the reputation he acquired by this sermon, contributed not a little toward that promotion which very soon followed its publication. For in December 1734, he received a very unexpected notice from Bishop Gibbon, that the king had fixed on him to be bishop of Bristol. Dr Benson was about the same time appointed to the see of Gloucester, as was Dr Fleming to that of Carlisle; and the three new bishops were all consecrated together in Lambeth Chapel, Jan. 1734-5, the consecration-sermon being preached by Dr Thomas, afterwards bishop of Winchester.\n\nThe honours to which Dr Secker was thus raised in the prime of life did not in the least abate his diligence and attention to business; for which, indeed, there was now more occasion than ever. His learned biographers, Messrs Porteous and Stinton, now relate the manner in which he set about the visitation of his diocese, and the ceremony of confirmation, which he performed in a great number of places; he also preached in several churches, sometimes twice a-day. The affairs of his parish of St James's being likewise in great disorder, he took extraordinary pains to regulate and adjust everything, particularly the management of the poor; and thus even in a temporal view became of signal service to his parishioners. But, say our authors, \"it was their spiritual welfare which engaged, as it ought to do, his chief attention. As far as the circumstances of the times, and the populousness of that part of the metropolis allowed, he omitted not even those private admonitions and personal applications which are often attended with the happiest effects. He allowed out of his own income a salary for reading early and late prayers, which had formerly been paid out of the offertory money. He held a confirmation once every year, examined the candidates several weeks before in the vestry, and gave them religious tracts, which he also distributed at other times very liberally to those that needed them. He drew up, for the use of his parishioners, that admirable course of Lectures on the Church Catechism which hath been lately published, and not only read them once every week on the usual days, but also every Sunday evening, either at the church or one of the chapels belonging to it.\"\n\nThe sermons which at the same time, we are told, he set himself to compose, \"were truly excellent and original. His faculties were now in their full vigour, and he had an audience to speak before that rendered the utmost exertion of them necessary. He did not, however, seek to gratify the higher part, by amusing them with refined speculations, or ingenious elays, unintelligible to the lower part, and unprofitable to both; but he laid before them all, with equal freedom and plainness, the great Christian duties belonging to their respective stations, and reproved the follies and vices of every rank among them, without distinction or palliation. He studied human nature thoroughly in all its various forms, and knew what sort of arguments would have most weight with each class of men. He brought the subject home to their bosoms, and did not seem to be merely saying useful things in their presence, but adressing himself personally to every one of them. Few ever possessed, in a higher degree, the rare talent of touching on the most delicate subjects with the nicest propriety and decorum, of saying the most familiar things without being low, the plainest without being feeble, the boldest without giving offence. He could defend with such singular ease and felicity into the minutest concerns of common life, lay open with so much address the various workings, artifices, and evasions of the human mind, that his audience often thought their own particular cases alluded to, and heard with surprize their private sentiments and feelings, their ways of reasoning and principles of acting, exactly stated and described. His preaching was, at the same time, highly rational, and truly evangelical. He explained with perspicuity, he affected with dignity, the peculiar characteristic doctrines of the gospel. He inculcated the utility, the necessity of them, not merely as speculative truths, but as actual instruments of moral goodnes, tending to purify the hearts and regulate the lives of men; and thus, by God's gracious appointment, as well as by the inseparable connection between true faith and right practice, leading them to salvation.\n\n\"These important truths he taught with the authority, the tenderness, the familiarity, of a parent instructing his children. Though he neither possessed nor affected the artificial eloquence of an orator who wants to amuse or to mislead, yet he had that of an honest man who wants to convince, of a Christian preacher who wants to reform and to save those that hear him. Solid argument, manly sense, useful directions, short, nervous, striking sentences, awakening questions, frequent and pertinent applications of scripture; all these following each other in quick succession, and coming evidently from the speaker's heart, enforced by his elocution, his figure, his action, and above all, by the corresponding sanctity of his example, stamped conviction on the minds of his hearers, and sent them home with impressions not easy to be effaced. It will readily be imagined that with these powers he quickly became one of the most admired and popular preachers of his time.\"\n\nIn 1737 he succeeded to the see of Oxford, on the promotion of Dr Potter to that of Canterbury, then vacant by the death of Archbishop Wake.\n\nIn the spring of 1748, Mrs Secker died of the gout in her stomach. She was a woman of great sense and merit,\nmerit, but of a weak and sickly constitution. The bishop's affection and tenderness for her was suited to his character. In 1750, he was installed dean of St Paul's, for which he gave in exchange the rectory of St James's and his prebend of Durham. \"It was no wonder (say our authors) that, after presiding over so extensive and populous a parish for upwards of 17 years, he should willingly consent to be released from a burden which began now to grow too great for his strength. When he preached his farewell sermon, the whole audience melted into tears: he was followed with the prayers and good wishes of those whom every honest man would be most anxious to please; and there are numbers still living who retain a strong and grateful remembrance of his excellent and tender solicitude for their welfare. Having now more leisure both to prosecute his own studies and to encourage those of others, he gave Dr Church considerable assistance in his First and Second Vindication of the Miraculous Powers, &c., against Dr Middleton, and he was of equal use to him in his Analysis of Lord Bolingbroke's Works. About the same time began the late Archdeacon Sharp's controversy with the followers of Mr Hutchinson, which was carried on to the end of the year 1755.\" Bishop Secker, we are told, read over all Dr Sharp's papers, amounting to three volumes 8vo, and corrected and improved them throughout. But the ease which this late change of situation gave him was soon disturbed by a heavy and unexpected stroke, the loss of his three friends, Bishops Butler, Benson, and Berkeley, who were all cut off within the space of one year.\n\nOur authors next give an account of the part which Dr Secker bore, in the house of lords, in respect to the famous repeal of the Jew bill; for which the duke of Newcastle moved, and was seconded by the Bishop, in a speech which, we are told, was remarkably well received. At length his distinguished merit prevailed over all the political obstacles to his advancement, and placed him, without any efforts or application of his own, in that important station which he had shown himself so well qualified to adorn. On the death of Archbishop Hutton, he was promoted to the see of Canterbury, and was confirmed at Bow-church, April 21, 1758; on which occasion our authors observe, that in accepting this high and burdensome station, Dr Secker acted on that principle which influenced him through life; that he sacrificed his own ease and comfort to considerations of public utility; that the mere secular advantages of grandeur were objects below his ambition; and were, as he knew and felt, but poor compensations for the anxiety and difficulties attending them. He had never once through his whole life asked preferment for himself, nor thrown any unbecoming eagerness for it; and the use he made of his newly acquired dignity very clearly showed, that rank, and wealth, and power, had in no other light any charms for him, than as they enlarged the sphere of his active and industrious benevolence.\n\nHe fought out and encouraged men of real genius or extensive knowledge; he expended 300l. in arranging and improving the manuscript library at Lambeth; and observing with concern, that the library of printed books in that palace had received no additions since the time of Archbishop Tenison, he made it his business to collect books in all languages from most parts of Europe at a very great expense, with a view of supplying that want; which he accordingly did, by leaving them to the library at his death, and thereby rendered that collection one of the noblest and most useful in the kingdom.\n\nAll designs and institutions which tended to advance good morals and true religion, he patronized with zeal and generosity; he contributed largely to the maintenance of schools for the poor; to rebuilding or repairing parsonage houses and places of worship; and gave no less than 600l. towards erecting a chapel in the parish of Lambeth. To the society for promoting Christian knowledge he was a liberal benefactor; and to that for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, of which he was the president, he paid much attention; was constant at all the meetings of its members, even sometimes when his health would but ill permit, and superintended their deliberations with consummate prudence and temper.\n\nWhenever any publications came to his knowledge that were manifestly calculated to corrupt good morals, or subvert the foundations of Christianity, he did his utmost to stop the circulation of them; yet the wretched authors themselves he was so far from wishing to treat with any undue rigour, that he has more than once extended his bounty to them in distresses. And when their writings could not properly be suppressed (as was too often the case) by lawful authority, he engaged men of abilities to answer them, and rewarded them for their trouble. His attention was everywhere. Even the falsehoods and misrepresentation of writers in the newspapers, on religious or ecclesiastical subjects, he generally took care to have contradicted; and when they seemed likely to injure, in any material degree, the cause of virtue and religion, or the reputation of eminent and worthy men, he would sometimes take the trouble of answering them himself. One instance of this kind, which does him honour, and deserves mention, was his defence of Bishop Butler, who, in a pamphlet published in 1767, was accused of having died a Papist. The conduct which he observed towards the several divisions and denominations of Christians in this kingdom was such as showed his way of thinking to be truly liberal and catholic. The dangerous spirit of popery, indeed, he thought should always be kept under proper legal restraints, on account of its natural opposition not only to the religious but the civil rights of mankind. He therefore observed its movements with care, and exhorted his clergy to do the same, especially those who were situated in the midst of Roman Catholic families; against whose influence they were charged to be upon their guard, and were furnished with proper books or instructions for that purpose. He took all fit opportunities of combating the errors of the church of Rome in his own writings (a); and the best answers that were published to some of the late bold apologies for popery were written at his instance, and under his direction.\n\nWith\n\n(A) See particularly his sermons on the rebellion in 1745; on the Protestant working schools in Ireland; on the\nWith the Dissenters his Grace was sincerely desirous of cultivating a good understanding. He considered them, in general, as conscientious and valuable classes of men. With some of the most eminent of them, Watts, Doddridge, Leland, Chandler, Lardner, he maintained an intercourse of friendship or civility. By the most candid and considerate part of them he was highly reverenced and esteemed; and to such among them as needed help he showed no less kindness and liberality than to those of his own communion.\n\nNor was his concern for the Protestant cause confined to his own country. He was well known as the great patron and protector of it in various parts of Europe; from whence he had frequent applications for assistance, which never failed of being favourably received. To several foreign Protestants he allowed pensions, to others he gave occasional relief, and to some of their universities was an annual benefactor.\n\nIn public affairs, his Grace acted the part of an honest citizen, and a worthy member of the British legislature. From his first entrance into the house of peers, his parliamentary conduct was uniformly upright and noble. He kept equally clear from the extremes of factious pertinacity and servile dependence; never wantonly thwarting administration from motives of party zeal or private pique, or personal attachment, or a passion for popularity; nor yet going every length with every minister from views of interest or ambition. He admired and loved the constitution of his country, and wished to preserve it unaltered and unimpaired. So long as a due regard to this was maintained, he thought it his duty to support the measures of government; but whenever they were evidently inconsistent with the public welfare, he opposed them with freedom and firmness. Yet his opposition was always tempered with the utmost fidelity, respect, and decency, to the excellent prince upon the throne; and the most candid allowances for the unavoidable errors and infirmities even of the very best ministers, and the peculiarly difficult situation of those who govern a free and high-spirited people. He seldom spoke in parliament, except where the interests of religion and virtue seemed to require it; but whenever he did, he spoke with propriety and strength, and was heard with attention and deference. Though he never attached himself blindly to any set of men, yet his chief political connections were with the late duke of Newcastle and Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. To these he principally owed his advancement; and he had the good fortune to live long enough to show his gratitude to them or their descendants.\n\nFor more than ten years, during which Dr Secker enjoyed the fee of Canterbury, he resided constantly at his archiepiscopal house at Lambeth. A few months before his death, the dreadful pains he felt had compelled him to think of trying the Bath waters; but that design was frustrated by the fatal accident which put an end to his life.\n\nHis Grace had been for many years subject to the gout, which, in the latter part of his life, returned with more frequency and violence, and did not go off in a regular manner, but left the parts affected for a long time very weak, and was succeeded by pains in different parts of the body. About a year and a half before he died, after a fit of the gout, he was attacked with a pain in the arm, near the shoulder, which having continued about 12 months, a similar pain seized the upper and outer part of the opposite thigh, and the arm soon became easier. This was much more grievous than the former, as it quickly disabled him from walking, and kept him in almost continual torment, except when he was in a reclining position. During this time he had two or three fits of the gout; but neither the gout nor the medicines alleviated these pains, which, with the want of exercise, brought him into a general bad habit of body.\n\nOn Saturday July 30, 1768, he was seized, as he sat at dinner, with a sickness at his stomach. He recovered before night; but the next evening, while his physicians were attending, and his servants raising him on his couch, he suddenly cried out that his thigh-bone was broken. The shock was so violent, that the servants perceived the couch to shake under him, and the pain so acute and unexpected, that it overcame the firmness he so remarkably possessed. He lay for some time in great agonies; but when the surgeons arrived, and discovered with certainty that the bone was broken, he was perfectly resigned, and never afterwards asked a question about the event. A fever soon ensued. On Tuesday he became lethargic, and continued to till about five o'clock on Wednesday afternoon, when he expired with great calmness, in the 75th year of his age.\n\nOn examination, the thigh-bone was found to be cavious about four inches in length, and at nearly the same distance from its head. The disease took its rise from the internal part of the bone, and had so entirely destroyed its substance, that nothing remained at the part where it was broken but a portion of its outward integument; and even this had many perforations, one of which was large enough to admit two fingers, and was filled with a fungous substance arising from within the bone. There was no appearance of matter about the caries, and the surrounding parts were in a sound state. It was apparent that the torture which he underwent during the gradual corrosion of this bone must have been inexplicably great. Out of tenderness to his family he seldom made any complaints to them, but to his physicians he frequently declared his pains were so excruciating, that unless some relief could be procured, he thought it would be impossible for human nature to support them long. Yet he bore them for upwards of six months with astonishing patience and fortitude; sat up generally the greater part of the day, admitted his particular friends to see him, mixed with his family at the usual hours, sometimes with his usual cheerfulness; and, except some very slight defects of memory, retained all his faculties and senses in their full vigour till within a few days of his death. He was buried, pursuant...\nfuant to his own directions, in a covered passage, leading from a private door of the palace to the north door of Lambeth church; and he forbade any monument or epitaph to be placed over him.\n\nBy his will he appointed the Rev. Dr Daniel Burton, canon of Christ-church, and Mrs Catherine Talbot, already mentioned in the course of these memoirs, his executors; and left £3,000. in trust to the Drs Porteous and Stinton, his chaplains; to pay the interest thereof to Mrs Talbot and her daughter during their joint lives, or the life of the survivor; and after the decease of both those ladies, £1,000. of the said £3,000. are to be transferred to charitable purposes; among which are £100. to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and £100. to the same society for a bishop or bishops in the king's dominions in America.\n\nThe following description is given of his person: He was tall and comely; in the early part of his life slender, and rather consumptive; but as he advanced in years his constitution gained strength, and his size increased, yet never to a degree of corpulency that was disproportionate or troublesome.\n\nThe dignity of his form corresponded with the greatness of his mind, and inspired at all times respect and awe; but peculiarly so when he was engaged in any of the more solemn functions of religion, into which he entered with such devout earnestness and warmth, with just a consciousness of the place he was in, and the business he was about, as seemed to raise him above himself, and added new life and spirit to the natural gracefulness of his appearance.\n\nHis countenance was open, ingenious, and expressive of every thing right. It varied easily with his spirits and his feelings, so as to be a faithful interpreter of his mind, which was incapable of the least disimulation. It could speak dejection, and, on occasion, anger, very strongly; but when it meant to show pleasure or approbation, it softened into a most gracious smile, and diffused over all his features the most benevolent and reviving complacency that can be imagined.\n\nSECOND, in Geometry, Chronology, &c. the 60th part of a prime or minute, whether of a degree or of an hour.\n\nSECOND, in Music, one of the musical intervals; being only the difference between any sound and the next nearest found, whether above or below it.\n\nSECOND Major, in Music.

This gift or faculty, which is neither voluntary nor constant, is in general rather troublesome than agreeable to the possessors of it, who are chiefly found among the inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland, those of the Western isles, of the Isle of Man, and of Ireland. It is an impression made either by the mind upon the eye, or by the eye upon the mind, by which things distant or future are perceived, and seen as if they were present. A man on a journey far from home falls from his horse; another, who is perhaps at work about the house, sees him bleeding on the ground; commonly with a landscape of the place where the accident befalls him. Another seer, driving home his cattle, or wandering in idleness, or amusing in the sunshine, is suddenly surprized by the appearance of a bridal ceremony, or funeral procession, and counts the mourners or attendants, of whom, if he knows them, he relates the names; if he knows them not, he can describe the dresses. Things distant are seen at the instant they happen.\n\nOf things future, Johnson says that he knows no rule pretended to for determining the time between the sight and the event; but we are informed by Mr Grose, that in general the time of accomplishment bears some relation to the time of the day in which the impressions are received. Thus visions seen early in the morning (which seldom happens) will be much sooner accomplished than those appearing at noon; and those seen at noon will take place in a much shorter time than those happening at night; sometimes the accomplishment of the last does not fall out within a year or more.\n\nThese visions are not confined to solemn or important events; nor is it true, as is commonly reported, that to the second sight nothing is presented but phantoms of evil. The future visit of a mountebank, or piper; a plentiful draught of fish; the arrival of common travellers; or, if possible, still more trifling matters than these,—are foreseen by the seers. A gentleman told Dr Johnson, that when he had once gone far from his own island, one of his labouring servants predicted his return, and described the livery of his attendant, which he had never worn at home; and which had been, without any previous design, occasionally given him.\n\nAs many men eminent for science and literature have admitted the reality of this apparently useless gift, we shall, without interposing our own opinion, give the reflections of two of the first characters of the age upon it, and leave our readers to form their own judgment. By Dr Beattie of Aberdeen it is thus accounted for.\n\nThe Highlands of Scotland are a picturesque but a melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous desert, covered with dark heath, and often obscured by misty weather; narrow valleys, thinly inhabited, and bounded by precipices resounding with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged, and a climate so dreary, as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the labours of agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes that intersect the country; the portentous noises which every change of the wind and every increased diminution of the waters is apt to raise in a lonely region full of echoes and rocks and caverns; the grotesque and ghastly appearance of such a landscape by the light of the moon: objects like these diffuse a gloom over the fancy, which may be compatible enough with occasional and social merriment, but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and solitude. If these people, notwithstanding their reformation in religion, and more frequent intercourse with strangers, do still retain many of their old superstitions, we need not doubt but in former times they must have been much more enslaved to the horrors of imagination, when belet with the bugbears of Popery and Paganism. Most of their superstitions are of a melancholy cast. That of second sight, by which some are still supposed to be haunted, is considered by themselves as a misfortune, on account of the many dreadful images it is said to obtrude upon the fancy. It is said that some of the Alpine regions do likewise lay claim to a sort of second sight.\nNor is it wonderful, that persons of a lively imagination, immersed in deep solitude, and surrounded with the stupendous scenery of clouds, precipices, and torrents, should dream (even when they think themselves awake) of those few striking ideas with which their lonely lives are diversified: of corpses, funeral processions, and other subjects of terror; or of marriages, and the arrival of strangers, and such like matters of more agreeable curiosity.\n\nLet it be observed also, that the ancient Highlanders of Scotland had hardly any other way of supporting themselves than by hunting, fishing, or war; professions that are continually exposed to fatal accidents. And hence, no doubt, additional horrors would often haunt their solitude, and a deeper gloom overshadow the imagination even of the hardiest native.\n\nA sufficient evidence can hardly be found for the reality of the second sight, or at least of what is commonly understood by that term. A treatise on the subject was published in the year 1762, in which many tales were told of persons whom the author believed to have been favoured, or haunted, with these illuminations; but most of the tales were trifling and ridiculous; and the whole work betrayed, on the part of the compiler, such extreme credulity, as could not fail to prejudice many readers against his system.\n\nThat any of these visionaries are apt to be swayed in their declarations by finiter views, we will not say; but this may be said with confidence, that none but ignorant people pretend to be gifted in this way. And in them it may be nothing more, perhaps, than short fits of sudden sleep or drowsiness, attended with lively dreams, and arising from some bodily disorder, the effect of idleness, low spirits, or a gloomy imagination. For it is admitted, even by the most credulous Highlanders, that as knowledge and industry are propagated in their country, the second sight disappears in proportion; and nobody ever laid claim to the faculty who was much employed in the intercourse of social life (a). Nor is it at all extraordinary, that one should have the appearance of being awake, and should even think oneself so, during those fits of dozing; that they should come on suddenly, and while one is engaged in some business. The same thing happens to persons much fatigued, or long kept awake, who frequently fall asleep for a moment, or for a long space, while they are standing, or walking, or riding on horseback. Add but a lively dream to this slumber, and (which is the frequent effect of disease) take away the consciousness of having been asleep, and a superstitious man may easily mistake his dream for a waking vision; which, however, is soon forgotten when no subsequent occurrence recalls it to his memory; but which, if it shall be thought to resemble any future event, exalts the poor dreamer into a Highland prophet. This conceit makes him more recluse and more melancholy than ever; and so feeds his disease, and multiplies his visions: which, if they are not dissipated by business or society, may continue to haunt him as long as he lives; and which, in their progress through the neighbourhood, receive some new tinctures of the marvellous from every mouth that promotes their circulation. As to the prophetic nature of this second sight, it cannot be admitted at all. That the Deity should work a miracle in order to give intimation of the frivolous things that these tales are made up of, the arrival of a stranger, the raising of a coffin, or the colour of a suit of clothes; and that these intimations should be given for no end, and to those persons only who are idle and solitary, who speak Gaelic, or who live among mountains and deserts—is like nothing in nature or providence that we are acquainted with; and must therefore, unless it were confirmed by satisfactory proof (which is not the case), be rejected as absurd and incredible.\n\nThese visions, such as they are, may reasonably enough be ascribed to a disordered fancy. And that in them, as well as in our ordinary dreams, certain appearances should, on some rare occasions, resemble certain events, is to be expected from the laws of chance; and seems to have in it nothing more marvellous or supernatural, than that the parrot, who deals out his familiarities at random, should sometimes happen to salute the passenger by his right appellation.\n\nTo the confidence of these objections Dr Johnson replies, that by presuming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they presuppose more knowledge of the universal system than man has attained; and therefore depend upon principles too complicated and extensive for our comprehension; and that there can be no security in the consequence when the premises are not understood; that the second sight is only wonderful because it is rare, for, considered in itself, it involves no more difficulty than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exercise of the cognitive faculty; that a general opinion of communicative impulses, or visionary representations, has prevailed in all ages and all nations; that particular instances have been given with such evidence, as neither Bacon nor Bayle has been able to refute; that sudden impressions, which the event has verified, have been felt by more than own or publish them; that the second sight of the Hebrides implies only the local frequency of a power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable to decide by antecedent reason, we must be content to yield to the force of testimony. By pretension to second sight, no profit was ever sought or gained. It is an involuntary affection, in which neither hope nor fear are known to have any part. Those who profess to feel it do not boast of it as a privilege, nor are considered by others as advantageously distinguished. They have no temptation to feign, and their hearers have no motive to encourage the imposture.\n\nSecond Terms, in Algebra, those where the unknown quantity has a degree of power less than it has in the term where it is raised to the highest. The art of throwing these second terms out of an equation, that is,\n\n(a) This, however, is denied by Johnson, who affirms that the Islanders of all degrees, whether of rank or understanding, universally admit it except the ministers, who, according to him, reject it, in consequence of a system, against conviction. He affirms, too, that in 1773, there was in the Hebrides a second-sighted gentleman, who complained of the terrors to which he was exposed.\nSecondary, of forming a new equation where they have no place, is one of the most ingenious and useful inventions in all algebra.\n\nSecondary, in general, something that acts as second or in subordination to another.\n\nSecondary or Secondary, an officer who acts as second or next to the chief officer. Such are the secondaries of the courts of king's bench and common pleas; the secondaries of the compters, who are next the the-riffs of London in each of the two compters; two secondaries of the pipe; secondaries to the remembrancers, &c.\n\nSecondary Circles of the Ecliptic are circles of longitude of the stars; or circles which, passing through the poles of the ecliptic, are at right angles to the ecliptic.

See ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nSecretary, an officer who, by his master's orders, writes letters, dispatches, and other instruments, which he renders authentic by his signet. Of these there are several kinds; as, 1. Secretaries of state, who are officers that have under their management and direction the most important affairs of the kingdom, and are obliged constantly to attend on the king; they receive and dispatch whatever comes to their hands, either from the crown, the church, the army, private grants, pardons, dispensations, &c. as likewise petitions to the sovereign, which, when read, are returned to them; all which they dispatch according to the king's direction. They have authority to commit persons for treason, and other offences against the state, as conservators of the peace at common law, or as justices of the peace throughout the kingdom. They are members of the privy-council, which is seldom or never held without one of them being present. As to the business and correspondence in all parts of this kingdom, it is managed by either of the secretaries without any distinction; but with respect to foreign affairs, the business is divided into two provinces or departments, the southern and the northern, comprehending all the kingdoms and states that have any intercourse with Great Britain; each secretary receiving all letters and addresses from, and making all dispatches to, the several princes and states comprehended in his province. Ireland and the Plantations are under the direction of the elder secretary, who has the southern province, which also comprehends, France, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey; the northern province includes the Low Countries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Muscovy. Each of the secretaries has an apartment in all the royal houses, both for their own accommodation and their officers; they have also a table at the king's charge, or else board-wages. The two secretaries for Britain have each two under secretaries, and one chief clerk; with an uncertain number of other clerks and translators, all wholly depending on them. To the secretaries of state belong the custody of that seal properly called the signet, and the direction of two other offices, one called the paper-office, and the other the signet-office. In addition to these, there is a secretary for the war department, whose office must be temporary. 2. Secretary of an embassy, a person attending an ambassador, for writing dispatches relating to the negociation. There is a great difference between the secretaries of an embassy and the ambassador's secretary; the last being a domestic or menial of the ambassador, and the first a servant or minister of the prince. 3. The secretary of war, an officer of the war-office, who has two chief clerks under him, the last of which is the secretary's messenger. There are also secretaries in most of the other offices.\n\nSecretion, in the animal economy. See PHYSIOLOGY Index.\n\nSect, a collective term, comprehending all such as follow the doctrines and opinions of some famous divine, philosopher, &c.\n\nSection, in general, denotes a part of a divided thing, or the division itself. Such, particularly, are the subdivisions of a chapter; called also paragraphs and articles: the mark of a section is §.\n\nSection, in Geometry, denotes a side or surface of a body or figure cut off by another; or the place where lines, planes, &c. cut each other.\n\nSector, in Geometry, is a part of a circle comprehended between two radii and the arch: or it is a mixed triangle, formed by two radii and the arch of a circle.\n\nSector, is also a mathematical instrument, of great use in finding the proportion between quantities of the same kind: as between lines and lines, surfaces and surfaces, &c. whence the French call it the compass of proportion. The great advantage of the sector above the common scales, &c., is, that it is made so as to fit all radii and all scales. By the lines of chords, fines, &c. on the sector, we have lines of chords, fines, &c. to any radius betwixt the length and breadth of the sector when open.\n\nThe real inventor of this valuable instrument is unknown; yet of so much merit has the invention appeared, that it was claimed by Galileo, and disputed by nations.\n\nThe sector is founded on the fourth proposition of the sixth book of Euclid; where it is demonstrated, that similar triangles have their homologous sides proportional. An idea of the theory of its construction may be conceived thus. Let the lines AB, AC (Plate CCCCLXXVIII. fig. 1.) represent the legs of the sector; and AD, AE, two equal sections from the centre: if, now the points CB and DE be connected, the lines CB and DE will be parallel; therefore the triangles ADE, ACB will be similar; and consequently the sides AD, DE, AB, and BC, proportional; that is, as AD : DE :: AB : BC: whence, if AD be the half, third, or fourth part of AB; DE will be a half, third, or fourth part of CB: and the same holds of all the rest. If, therefore, AD be the chord, fine, or tangent, of any number of degrees to the radius AB; DE will be the same to the radius BC.\n\nDescription of the Sector. The instrument consists of described, two rules or legs, of brass or ivory, or any other matter, representing the radii, moveable round an axis or joint, the middle of which expresses the centre; whence are drawn on the faces of the rulers several scales, which may be distinguished into single and double.\n\nThe double scales, or lines graduated upon the faces of fig. 3, &c.\nof the instrument, and which are to be used as sectorial lines, proceed from the centre; and are, 1. Two scales of equal parts, one on each leg, marked LIN. or L.; each of these scales, from the great extensiveness of its use, is called the line of lines. 2. Two lines of chords marked CHO. or C. 3. Two lines of secants marked SEC. or S. A line of polygons marked POL. Upon the other face the sectorial lines are, 1. Two lines of lines marked SIN. or S. 2. Two lines of tangents marked TAN. or T. 3. Between the line of tangents and lines there is another line of tangents to a lesser radius, to supply the defect of the former, and extending from 45° to 75°, marked t.\n\nEach pair of these lines (except the line of polygons) is so adjusted as to make equal angles at the centres; and consequently at whatever distance the sector be opened, the angles will always respectively equal. That is, the distance between 10 and 10 on the line of lines, will be equal to 60 and 60 on the line of chords, 90 and 90 on the line of lines, and 45 and 45 on the line of tangents.\n\nBesides the sectorial scales, there are others on each face, placed parallel to the outward edges, and used as those of the common plane scale. 1. There is a line of inches. 2. A line of latitudes. 3. A line of hours. 4. A line of inclination of meridians. 5. A line of chords. Three logarithmic scales, namely, one of numbers, one of lines, and one of tangents. These are used when the sector is fully opened, the legs forming one line (A).\n\nThe value of the divisions on most of the lines are determined by the figures adjacent to them; these proceed by tens, which constitute the divisions of the first order, and are numbered accordingly; but the value of the divisions on the line of lines, that are distinguished by figures, is entirely arbitrary, and may represent any value that is given to them; hence the figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. may denote either 10, 20, 30, 40, or 100, 200, 300, 400, and so on.\n\nThe line of lines is divided into ten equal parts, numbered 1, 2, 3, to 10; these may be called divisions of the first order; each of these is again subdivided into ten other equal parts, which may be called divisions of the second order; each of these is divided into two equal parts, forming divisions of the third order. The divisions on all the scales are contained between four parallel lines; those of the third order extend to the most distant; those of the third to the least; those of the second to the intermediate parallel.\n\nWhen the whole line of lines represents 100, the divisions of the first order, or those to which the figures are annexed, represent tens; those of the second order units; those of the third order the halves of these units. If the whole line represent ten, then the divisions of the first order are units; those of the second tenths; the thirds twentieths.\n\nIn the line of tangents, the divisions to which the numbers are affixed, are the degrees expressed by those numbers. Every fifth degree is denoted by a line somewhat longer than the rest; between every number and each fifth degree, there are four divisions longer than the intermediate adjacent ones, these are whole degrees; the shorter ones, or those of the third order, are 30 minutes.\n\nFrom the centre, to 60 degrees, the line of lines is divided like the line of tangents, from 60 to 70; it is divided only to every degree, from 70 to 80, to every two degrees, from 80 to 90; the division must be estimated by the eye.\n\nThe divisions on the line of chords are to be estimated in the same manner as the tangents.\n\nThe lesser line of tangents is graduated every two degrees, from 45 to 50; but from 50 to 60 to every degree; from 60 to the end, to half degrees.\n\nThe line of secants from 0 to 10 is to be estimated by the eye; from 20 to 50, it is divided to every two degrees; from 50 to 60, to every degree; from 60 to the end, to every half degree.\n\nUse of the Line of Equal Parts on the Sector. 1. To divide a given line into any number of equal parts, supposing the line to be seven. Take the given line in your compasses, and setting one foot in a division of equal parts, the parts may be divided by seven, for example 70, whose seventh part is 10; open the sector till the other point fall exactly on 70, in the same line on the other leg. In this disposition, applying one point of the compasses to 10 in the same line; shut them till the other fall in 10 in the same line on the other leg, and this opening will be the seventh part of the given line. Note, if the line to be divided be too long to be applied to the legs of the sector, divide only one half or one fourth by seven, and the double or quadruple thereof will be the seventh part of the whole.\n\n2. To measure the lines of the perimeter of a polygon, one of which contains a given number of equal parts. Take the given line in your compasses, and set it parallel, upon the line of equal parts, to the number a polygon, on each leg expressing its length. The sector remaining thus, set off the length of each of the other lines parallel to the former, and the number each of them falls on will express its length.\n\n3. A right line being given, and the number of subtractions it contains, suppose 120, to take from it a shorter line, containing any number of the same parts, suppose 25. Take the given line in your compasses, open the sector till the two feet fall on 120 on each leg; then will the distance between 25 on one leg, and the same number on the other, give the line required.\n\n4. To multiply by the line of equal parts on the Multiplicator. Take the lateral distance from the centre of the line to the given multiplicator; open the sector till you fit that lateral distance to the parallel of 1 and 1, or 10 and 10, and keep the sector in that disposition; then take in the compasses the parallel distance of the multiplicand, which distance, measured laterally on the same line, will give the product required. Thus, suppose it were required to find the product of 8 multiplied by 4: take the lateral distance from the centre of the line to 4 in your compasses, i.e., place one foot of the compasses in the beginning of the divisions, and extend the other along the line to 4. Open the sector till you fit this lateral distance to the parallel of 1 and\n\n(a) The lines are placed in different orders on different sectors, but they may easily be found by these general directions.\nThen take the parallel distance of 8, the multiplicand; i.e., extend the compasses from 8, in this line, on one leg, to 8 in the same line on the other; and that extent, measured laterally, will give the product required.\n\n5. To divide by the line of equal parts on the sector. Extend the compasses laterally from the beginning of the line to 1, and open the sector till you fit that extent to the parallel of the divisor; then take the parallel distance of the dividend, which extent, measured in a lateral direction, will give the quotient required. Thus, suppose it was required to divide 36 by 4: extend the compasses laterally, the beginning of the line to 1, and fit to that extent the parallel of 4, the divisor; then extend the compasses parallel, from 36 on one leg to 36 on the other, and that extent, measured laterally, will give 9, the quotient required.\n\n6. Proportion by the line of equal parts. Make the lateral distance of the second term the parallel distance of the first term, the parallel distance of the third term is the fourth proportional. Example. To find a fourth proportional to 8, 4, and 6, take the lateral distance of 4, and make it the parallel distance of 8; then the parallel distance of 6, extended from the centre, shall reach to the fourth proportional 3.\n\nIn the same manner, a third proportional is found to two numbers. Thus, to find a third proportional to 8 and 4, the sector remaining as in the former example, the parallel distance of 4, extended from the centre, shall reach to the third proportional 2. In all these cases, if the number to be made a parallel distance be too great for the sector, some aliquot part of it is to be taken, and the answer is to be multiplied by the number by which the first number was divided.\n\nUse of the Line of Chords on the Sector. 1. To open the sector so as the two lines of chords may make an angle or number of degrees, suppose 40. Take the distance from the joint to 40, the number of the degrees proposed, on the line of chords; open the sector till the distance from 60 to 60, on each leg, be equal to the given distance of 40; then will the two lines on the sector form an angle of 40 degrees, as was required.\n\n2. The sector being opened, to find the degrees of its aperture. Take the extent from 60 to 60, and lay it off on the line of chords from the centre; the number whereon it terminates will show the degrees, &c., required.\n\n3. To lay off any number of degrees upon the circumference of a circle. Open the sector till the distance between 60 and 60 be equal to the radius of the given circle; then take the parallel extent of the chord of the number of degrees on each leg of the sector, and lay it off on the circumference of the given circle.—Hence any regular polygon may be easily inscribed in a given circle.\n\nUse of the Line of Polygons on the Sector. 1. To inscribe a regular polygon in a given circle. Take the semidiameter of the given circle in the compasses, and adjust it to the number 6, on the line of polygons, on each leg of the sector; then, the sector remaining thus opened, take the distance of the two equal numbers, expressing the number of sides the polygon is to have; e.g., the distance from 5 to 5 for a pentagon, from 7 to 7 for a heptagon, &c. These distances carried about the circumference of the circle, will divide it into so many equal parts.\n\n2. To describe a regular polygon, e.g., a pentagon, on a given right line. Take the length of the line in the compasses, and apply it to the extent of the number 5, 5, on the lines of polygons. The sector thus opened, upon the same lines take the extent from 6 to 6; this will be the semidiameter of the circle the polygon is to be inscribed in. If then, with this distance, from the ends of the given line, you describe two arches of a circle, their intersection will be the centre of the circle.\n\n3. On a right line, to describe an isosceles triangle, having the angles at the base double that at the vertex. Open the sector, till the ends of the given line fall on 10 and 10 on each leg; then take the distance from 6 to 6. This will be the length of the two equal sides of the triangle.\n\nUse of the Lines of Sines, Tangents, and Secants, on Sines, tangent, and Secant. By the several lines disposed on the sector, we have scales to several radii; so that having a secant, length or radius given, not exceeding the length of the sector when opened, we find the chord, sine, &c., thereto: e.g., Suppose the chord, sine, or tangent of 10 degrees, to a radius of 3 inches required; make 3 inches the aperture between 60 and 60, on the lines of chords of the two legs; then will the same extent reach from 45 to 45 on the line of tangents, and from 90 to 90 on the line of the sines on the other side; so that whatever radius the line of chords is set, to the same are all the others set. In this disposition, therefore, if the aperture between 10 and 10, on the lines of chords, be taken with the compasses, it will give the chord of 10 degrees. If the aperture of 10 and 10 be in like manner taken on the lines of sines, it will be the sine of 10 degrees. Lastly, if the aperture of 10 and 10 be in like manner taken on the lines of tangents, it gives the tangent of 10 degrees.\n\nIf the chord, or tangent, of 70 degrees were required; for the chord, the aperture of half the arch, viz., 35, must be taken, as before; which distance, repeated twice, gives the chord of 70 degrees. To find the tangent of 70 degrees to the same radius, the small line of tangents must be used, the other only reaching to 45; making, therefore, 3 inches the aperture between 45 and 45 on the final line; the extent between 70 and 70 degrees on the same, will be the tangent of 70 degrees to 3 inches radius.\n\nTo find the secant of an arch, make the given radius the aperture between 0 and 0 on the lines of secants; then will the aperture of 10 and 10, or 70 and 70, on the said lines, give the tangent of 10° or 70°.\n\nIf the converse of any of these things were required, that is, if the radius be required, to which a given line is the sine, tangent, or secant, it is but making the given line, if a chord, the aperture on the line of chords between 10 and 10, and then the sector will stand at the radius required; that is, the aperture between 60 and 60 on the said line is the radius. If the given line were a sine, tangent, or secant, it is but making it the aperture of the given number of degrees; then will the distance of 90 and 90 on the sines, of 45 and 45 on the tangents, of 0 and 0 on the secants, be the radius.\n\nSector of an Ellipse, of an Hyperbola, &c., is a part resembling\nThe inimitable Carmen Seculare of Horace was composed for this last day, in the Secular Games, held by Augustus.\n\nIt has been much disputed whether these games were held every hundred, or every hundred and ten years. Valerius Antius, Varro, and Livy, are quoted in support of the former opinion: In favour of the latter may be produced the quindecimviral registers, the edicts of Augustus, and the words of Horace in the Secular poem,\n\nCatus undenos decies per annos.\n\nIt was a general belief, that the girls who bore a part in the song should be soonest married; and that the children who did not dance and sing at the coming of Apollo, should die unmarried, and at an early period of life.\n\nSecular Poem, a poem sung or rehearsed at the secular games; of which kind we have a very fine piece among the works of Horace, being a laudic ode at the end of his epodes.\n\nSecularization, the act of converting a regular person, place, or benefice, into a secular one. Almost all the cathedral churches were anciently regular, that is, the canons were to be religious; but they have been since secularized. For the secularization of a regular church, there is required the authority of the pope, that of the prince, the bishop of the place, the patron, and even the consent of the people. Religious that want to be released from their vow, obtain briefs of secularization from the pope.\n\nSecundines, in Anatomy, the several coats or membranes wherein the fetus is wrapped up in the mother's womb; as the chorion and amnios, with the placenta, &c.\n\nSecundus, Joannes Nicolaus, an elegant writer of Latin poetry, was born at the Hague in the year 1511. His descent was from an ancient and honourable family in the Netherlands; and his father Nicolaus Everardus, who was born in the neighbourhood of Middleburg, seems to have been high in the favour of the emperor Charles V., as he was employed by that monarch in several stations of considerable importance. We find him first a member of the grand parliament or council of Mechelen, afterwards president of the states of Holland and Zealand at the Hague, and lastly holding a similar office at Mechelen, where he died, August 5, 1532, aged 70.\n\nThese various employments did not occupy the whole of Everardus's time. Notwithstanding the multiplicity of his business, he found leisure to cultivate letters with great success, and even to act as preceptor to his own children, who were five sons and three daughters. They all took the name of Nicolaï from their father; but on what account our author was called Secundus is not known. It could not be from the order of his birth, for he was the youngest son. Perhaps the name was not given him till he became eminent; and then, according to the fashion of the age, it might have its rise from some pun, such as his being Poetarum nemini Secundus. Poetry, however, was by no means the profession which his father wished him to follow. He intended him for the law, and when he could no longer direct his studies himself, placed him under the care of\nSecundus. Jacobus Valeardus. This man is said to have been every way well qualified to discharge the important trust which was committed to him; and he certainly gained the affection of his pupil, who, in one of his poems, mentions the death of Valeardus with every appearance of unfeigned sorrow. Another tutor was soon provided; but it does not appear that Secundus devoted much of his time to legal pursuits. Poetry and the finer arts of painting and sculpture had engaged his mind at a very early period; and the imagination, on which these have laid hold, can with difficulty submit to the dry study of musty civilians. Secundus is said to have written verses when but ten years old; and from the vast quantity which he left behind him, we have reason to conclude that such writing was his principal employment. He found time, however, to carve figures of all his own family, of his mistresses, of the emperor Charles V. of several eminent personages of those times, and of many of his intimate friends; and in the last edition of his works published by Scriverius at Leyden, 1631, there is a print of one of his mistresses with this inscription round it; Vatis amatoris Julia sculpta manu.\n\nSecundus having nearly attained the age of twenty-one, and being determined, as it would seem, to comply as far as possible with the wishes of his father, quitted Mechelen, and went to France, where at Bourges, a city in the Orleanois, he studied the civil law under the celebrated Andreas Alciatus. Alciatus was one of the most learned civilians of that age; but what undoubtedly endeared him much more to our author was his general acquaintance with polite literature, and more particularly his taste in poetry. Having studied a year under this eminent professor, and taken his degrees, Secundus returned to Mechelen, where he remained only a very few months. In 1533 he went into Spain with warm recommendations to the count of Nassau and other persons of high rank; and soon afterwards became secretary to the cardinal archbishop of Toledo in a department of business which required no other qualifications than what he possessed in a very eminent degree, a facility in writing with elegance the Latin language. It was during his residence with this cardinal that he wrote his Balia, a series of wanton poems, of which the fifth, seventh, and ninth carmina of Catullus seem to have given the hint. Secundus was not, however, a servile imitator of Catullus. His expressions seem to be borrowed rather from Tibullus and Propertius; and in the warmth of his descriptions he surpasses every thing that has been written on similar subjects by Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, C. Gallus, Ovid, or Horace.\n\nIn 1535 he accompanied the emperor Charles V. to the siege of Tunis, but gained no laurels as a folder. The hardships which were endured at that memorable siege were but little suited to the soft disposition of a votary of Venus and the muses; and upon an enterprise which might have furnished ample matter for an epic poem, it is remarkable that Secundus wrote nothing which has been deemed worthy of preservation. Having returned from his martial expedition, he was sent by the cardinal to Rome to congratulate the pope upon the success of the emperor's arms; but was taken to ill on the road, that he was not able to complete his journey. He was advised to seek, without a moment's delay, the benefit of his native air; and that happily recovered him.\n\nHaving now quitted the service of the archbishop of Toledo, Secundus was employed in the same office of secretary by the bishop of Utrecht; and so much had he hitherto distinguished himself by the classical elegance of his compositions, that he was soon called upon to fill the important post of private Latin secretary to the emperor, who was then in Italy. This was the most honourable office to which our author was ever appointed; but before he could enter upon it death put a stop to his career of glory. Having arrived at Saint Amand in the district of Tournay, in order to meet, upon business, with the bishop of Utrecht, he was on the 8th of October 1536 cut off by a violent fever, in the very flower of his age, not having quite completed his twenty-fifth year. He was interred in the church of the Benedictines, of which his patron, the bishop, was abbot or præbendary; and his near relations erected to his memory a marble monument, with a plain Latin inscription.\n\nThe works of Secundus have gone through several editions, of which the best and most copious is that of Scriverius already mentioned. It consists of Julia, Elégies lib. i.; Amores, Elégies lib. ii.; Ad Diversos Elégies lib. iii.; Basia, styled by the editor incomparabilis et divinis proflus liber; Epigrammata; Odarum liber unus; Epistolae liber unus Elegiacae; Epistolae Rurorum liber alter, heroico carmine scriptus; Funerum liber unus; Sylvæ et Carminum fragmenta; Poemata nonnulla fratrum; Itineraria Secundi tria, &c.; Epistolæ totidem, foliata oratione. Of these works it would be superfluous in us to give any character after the ample testimonies prefixed to them of Lelius Greg, Gyraldus, the elder Scaliger, Theodore Beza, and others equally celebrated in the republic of letters, who all speak of them with rapture. A French critic, indeed, after having affirmed that the genius of Secundus never produced anything which was not excellent in its kind, adds, with too much truth, Mais fa muse est un peu trop lascive. For this fault our author makes the following apology in an epigram addressed to the grammarians;\n\nCarmina cur spargam cunctis lasciva libellis,\nQueritis? Infelicis arceo grammaticos.\nFortia magnanimi canere si Caesaris arma,\nFactae Divorum religiosa virum:\nQuot miser exciperemque notas, pateraque litarus?\nQuot fierem teneris supplicium pueris?\nAt nunc uda mihi dictant cum Basia carmen,\nPruriat et verfu mentula multa meo:\nMe leget inimpuce juvenis placituras amicae,\nEt placitura nova blanda puella viro:\nEt quemcumque juvat lepidorum de grege vatum\nOtia felitivis ludere deliciis.\nLufibus et lactis procui hinc abfuisse, sævi\nGrammatici, injutus et cohibite manus.\nNe puer, ab malleis caefus lacrymanique leporis;\nDuram forte meis ossibus optet humum.\n\nSECURIDACA, a genus of plants belonging to the clas diadelphia. See Botany Index.\n\nSECUTORES, a species of gladiators among the Romans, whose arms were a helmet, a shield, and a sword or a leaden bullet. They were armed in this manner, because they had to contend with the retiarii, who were\nSedition\n\nSecutores were dressed in a short tunic, bore a three-pointed lance in their left hand, and a net in their right. The retiarius attempted to cast his net over the head of the secutor; and if he succeeded, he drew it together and flew him with his trident: but if he missed his aim, he immediately betook himself to flight till he could find a second opportunity of entangling his adversary with his net. He was pursued by the secutor, who endeavoured to dispatch him in his flight.\n\nSecutores was also a name given to such gladiators as took the place of those killed in the combat, or who engaged the conqueror. This post was usually taken by lot.\n\nSEDAN is a town in France, in the department of the Ardennes, in E. Long. 4°. 45'. N. Lat. 49°. 46'. This is the capital of a principality of the same name, situated on the Maas, six miles from Bouillon, and fifteen from Charleville. Its situation on the frontiers of the territory of Liege, Namur, and Limburg, formerly rendered it one of the keys of the kingdom. It is extremely well fortified, and defended by a strong citadel. The castle is situated on a rock, surrounded with large towers and strong walls; here you see a most beautiful magazine of ancient arms. The governor's palace is opposite the castle. From the ramparts you have a most agreeable prospect of the Maas and the neighbouring country. Though the town is but small, yet it is full of tradesmen, as tanners, weavers, dyers, &c., the manufacture of fine cloth in this city employing a great number of hands. The principality of Sedan formerly belonged to the duke of Bouillon, who was obliged in the beginning of the last century to resign it to the crown.\n\nSEDAN-CHAIR is a covered vehicle for carrying a single person, supported by two poles, and borne by two men, hence denominated chairmen. They were first introduced in London in 1634, when Sir Sanders Duncomb obtained the sole privilege to use, let, and hire a number of the said covered chairs for fourteen years.\n\nSEDGMOOR, a large and rich tract of land in Somersetshire, memorable for the defeat of the duke of Monmouth, in 1685. It lies between Somerton and Bridgewater.\n\nSEDITION, among civilians, is used for a factious commotion of the people, or an assembly of a number of citizens without lawful authority, tending to disturb the peace and order of the society. This offence is of different kinds: some seditions more immediately threatening the supreme power, and the subversion of the present constitution of the state; others tending only towards the redress of private grievances. Among the Romans, therefore, it was variously punished, according as its end and tendency threatened greater mischief. See lib. i. Cod. de Seditione, and Mat. de Crimin. lib. ii. n. 5. de Lexa Majestate. In the punishment, the authors and ringleaders were justly distinguished from those who, with less wicked intention, joined and made part of the multitude.\n\nThe same distinction holds in the law of England and in that of Scotland. Some kinds of sedition in England amount to high treason, and come within the stat. 25 Edw. III. as levying war against the king. And several seditions are mentioned in the Scotch acts of parliament as treasonable. Bayne's Crim. Law of Scotland, p. 33, 34. The law of Scotland makes riotous and tumultuous assemblies a species of sedition. But the law there, as well as in England, is now chiefly regulated by the riot act, made 1 Geo. I. only it is to be observed, that the proper officers in Scotland, to make the proclamation thereby enacted, are sheriffs, lieutenants, and bailies of regalities, or their deputies; magistrates of royal boroughs, and all other inferior judges and magistrates; high and petty constables, or other officers of the peace, in any county, shire, city, or town. And in that part of the island, the punishment of the offence is anything short of death which the judges, in their discretion, may appoint.\n\nSEDATIVES, in Medicine, a general name for such medicines as weaken the powers of nature, such as blood-letting, cooling salts, purgatives, &c.\n\nSE-DEFENDENDO, in Law, a plea used for him that is charged with the death of another, by alleging that he was under a necessity of doing what he did in his own defence: so that the other assaulted him in such a manner, that if he had not done what he did, he must have been in hazard of his own life. See HOMICIDE and MURDER.\n\nSEDIMENT, the settlement or dregs of any thing, or that gross heavy part of a fluid body which sinks to the bottom of the vessel when at rest.\n\nSEDLEY, SIR CHARLES, an English poet and wit, the son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford in Kent, was born about the year 1639. At the restoration he came to London to join the general jubilee; and commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant. He was so much admired, that he became a kind of oracle among the poets; which made King Charles tell him, that Nature had given him a patent to be Apollo's viceroy. The productions of his pen were some plays, and several delicately tender amorous poems, in which the sweetness of the verses was so exquisite, as to be called by the duke of Buckingham Sedley's witchcraft. \"There were no marks of genius or true poetry to be defrauded, (say the authors of the Biographia Britannica); the art wholly consisted in raising loose thoughts and lewd desires, without giving any alarm; and so the poison worked gently and irresistibly.\" Our author, we may be sure, did not escape the infection of his own art, or rather was first tainted himself before he spread the infection to others.—A very ingenious writer of the present day, however, speaks much more favourably of Sir Charles Sedley's writings. \"He studied human nature; and was distinguished for the art of making himself agreeable, particularly to the ladies; for the verses of Lord Rochester, beginning with, Sedley has that prevailing gentle art, &c. so often quoted, allude not to his writings, but to his personal address.\" [Langhorn's Effusions, &c.]—But while he thus grew in reputation for wit and in favour with the king, he grew poor and debauched: his estate was impaired, and his morals were corrupted. One of his frolics, however, being followed by an indictment and a heavy fine, Sir Charles took a more serious turn, applied himself to business, and became a member of parliament, in which he was a frequent speaker. We find him in the house of commons in the reign of James II. whose attempts upon the constitution he vigorously withstood; and he was very active in bringing on the revolution. This was thought more extraordinary, as he had received favours from James. But that prince had taken a fancy to Sir Charles's\nCharles's daughter (though it seems she was not very handsome), and, in consequence of his intrigues with her, he created Miss Sedley countess of Dorchester. This honour, so far from pleasing, greatly shocked Sir Charles. However libertine he himself had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter's dishonour; and with regard to her exaltation, he only considered it as rendering her more conspicuously infamous. He therefore conceived a hatred for the king and from this, as well as other motives, readily joined to dispossess him of the throne. A witty saying of Sedley's, on this occasion, is recorded. \"I hate ingratitude,\" (said Sir Charles); and therefore, as the king has made my daughter a countess, I will endeavour to make his daughter a queen;\" meaning the princess Mary, married to the prince of Orange, who dispossessed James of the throne at the revolution. He lived to the beginning of Queen Anne's reign; and his works were printed in two vols. 8vo. 1719.\n\nSEDRE, or SEDRE, the high-priest of the sect of Ali among the Persians. The fedre is appointed by the emperor of Persia, who usually confers the dignity on his nearest relation. The jurisdiction of the fedre extends over all effects destined for pious purposes, over all mosques, hospitals, colleges, sepulchres, and monasteries. He disposes of all ecclesiastical employments, and nominates all the superiors of religious houses. His decisions in matters of religion are received as so many infallible oracles: he judges of all criminal matters in his own house without appeal. His authority is balanced by that of the mudschidh, or first theologian of the empire.\n\nSEDUCTION, is the act of tempting and drawing aside from the right path, and comprehends every endeavour to corrupt any individual of the human race. This is the import of the word in its largest and most general sense; but it is commonly employed to express the act of tempting a virtuous woman to part with her chastity.\n\nThe seducer of female innocence practises the same stratagems of fraud to get possession of a woman's person, that the swindler employs to get possession of his neighbour's goods or money; yet the law of honour, which pretends to abhor deceit, and which impels its votaries to murder every man who pretends, however justly, to suspect them of fraud, or to question their veracity, applauds the address of a successful intrigue, though it be well known that the seducer could not have obtained his end without swearing to the truth of a thousand falsehoods, and calling upon God to witness promises which he never meant to fulfil.\n\nThe law of honour is indeed a very capricious rule, which accommodates itself to the pleasures and conveniences of higher life; but the law of the land, which is enacted for the equal protection of high and low, may be supposed to view the guilt of seduction with a more impartial eye. Yet for this offence, even the laws of this kingdom have provided no other punishment than a pecuniary satisfaction to the injured family; which, in England, can be obtained only by one of the quaintest fictions in the world, by the father's bringing his action against the seducer for the loss of his daughter's service during her pregnancy and nurturing. See Paley's Moral Philosophy, Book III. Part iii. Chap. 3.\n\nThe moralist, however, who eliminates the merit or demerit of actions, not by laws of human appointment, seduction, but by their general consequences as established by the laws of nature, must consider the seducer as a criminal of the deepest guilt. In every civilized country, and in many countries where civilization has made but small progress, the virtue of women is collected as it were into a single point, which they are to guard above all things, as that on which their happiness and reputation wholly depend. At first sight this may appear a capricious regulation; but a moment's reflection will convince us of the contrary. In the married state so much confidence is necessarily reposed in the fidelity of women to the beds of their husbands, and evils so great result from the violation of that fidelity, that whatever contributes in any degree to its preservation, must be agreeable to him who, in establishing the laws of nature, intended them to be subservient to the real happiness of all his creatures. But nothing contributes so much to preserve the fidelity of wives to their husbands, as the impressing upon the minds of women the highest veneration for the virtue of chastity. She who, when unmarried, has been accustomed to grant favours to different men, will not find it easy, if indeed possible, to resist afterwards the allurements of variety. It is therefore a wise institution, and agreeable to the will of Him who made us, to train up women so as that they may look upon the loss of their chastity as the most disgraceful of all crimes; as that which sinks them in the order of society, and robs them of all their value. In this light virtuous women actually look upon the loss of chastity. The importance of that virtue has been so deeply impressed upon their minds, and is so closely associated with the principle of honour, that they cannot think but with abhorrence upon the very deed by which it is lost. He therefore who by fraud and falsehood persuades the unsuspecting girl to deviate in one instance from the honour of the sex, weakens in a great degree her moral principle; and if he reconcile her to a repetition of her crime, he destroys that principle entirely, as she has been taught to consider all other virtues as inferior to that of chastity. Hence it is that the hearts of prostitutes are generally fleeced against the miseries of their fellow-creatures; that they lend their aid to the seducer in his practices upon other girls; that they lie and swear and steal without compunction; and that too many of them hesitate not to commit murder if it can serve any selfish purpose of their own.\n\nThe loss of virtue, though the greatest that man or woman can sustain, is not the only injury which the seducer brings on the girl whom he deceives. She cannot at once reconcile herself to prostitution, or even to the loss of character; and while a sense of shame remains in her mind, the misery which she suffers must be exquisite. She knows that she has forfeited what in the female character is most valued by both sexes; and she must be under the perpetual dread of a discovery. She cannot even confide in the honour of her seducer, who may reveal her secret in a fit of drunkenness, and thus rob her of her fame as well as of her virtue; and while she is in this state of anxious uncertainty, the agony of her mind must be inapparable. That it is so in fact, the many instances of child murder by unmarried women of every rank leave us no room to doubt. The affection of a mother to her new-born child is one of the most unequivocal and strongest instincts in human nature.\nSeduction, nature (see Instinct); and nothing short of the extremity of distress could prompt any one so far to oppose her nature as to embrace her hands in the blood of her imploring infant.\n\nEven this deed of horror seldom prevents a detection of the mother's frailty, which is indeed commonly discovered, though no child has been the consequence of her intrigue. He who can seduce is safe enough to betray; and no woman can part with her honour, and retain any well-grounded hope that her amours shall be kept secret. The villain to whom she surrendered will glory in his victory, if it was with difficulty obtained; and if she surrendered at discretion, her own behaviour will reveal her secret. Her reputation is then irretrievably lost, and no future circumvention will be of the smallest avail to recover it. She will be shunned by the virtuous part of her own sex, and treated as a mere instrument of pleasure by the other. In such circumstances she cannot expect to be married with advantage. She may perhaps be able to captivate the heart of a heedless youth, and prevail upon him to unite his fate to her's before the delirium of his passion shall give him time for reflection; she may be addressed by a man who is a stranger to her story, and married while he has no suspicion of her secret; or she may be solicited by one of a station inferior to her own, who, though acquainted with every thing that has befell her, can barter the delicacy of wedded love for some pecuniary advantage; but from none of these marriages can the look for happiness. The delirium which prompted the first will soon vanish, and leave the husband to the bitterness of his own reflections, which can hardly fail to produce cruelty to the wife. Of the secret, to which, in the second case, the lover was a stranger, the husband will soon make a discovery, or at least find room for harbouring strong suspicions; and suspicions of having been deceived in a point so delicate have hitherto been uniformly the parents of misery. In the third case, the man married her merely for money, of which having got the possession, he has no farther inducement to treat her with respect. Such are some of the consequences of seduction, even when the person seduced has the good fortune to get afterwards a husband; but this is a fortune which few in her circumstances can reasonably expect. By far the greater part of those who have been defrauded of their virtue by the arts of the seducer sink deeper and deeper into guilt, till they become at last common prostitutes. The public is then deprived of their service as wives and parents; and instead of contributing to the population of the state, and to the sum of domestic felicity, these outcasts of society become seducers in their turn, corrupting the morals of every young man whose appetites they can inflame, and of every young woman whom they can entice to their own practices.\n\nAll this complication of evil is produced at first by arts, which, if employed to deprive a man of his property, would subject the offender to the execution of his fellow-subjects, and to an ignominious death; but while the forger of a bill is pursued with relentless rigour by the ministers of justice, and the swindler loaded with universal reproach, the man who by fraud and forgery has enticed an innocent girl to gratify his desires at the expense of her virtue and thus introduced her into a path which must infallibly lead to her own ruin, as well as to repeated injuries to the public at large, is not despised by his own sex, and is too often carelessly even by the virtuous part of the other. Yet the loss of property may be easily repaired; the loss of honour is irreparable! It is vain to plead in alleviation of this guilt, that women should be on their guard against the arts of the seducer. Most unquestionably they should; but arts have been used which hardly any degree of caution would have been sufficient to counteract. It may as well be said that the trader should be on his guard against the arts of the forger, and accept of no bill without previously consulting him in whose name it is written. Cases, indeed, occur in trade, in which this caution would be impossible; but she must be little acquainted with the workings of the human heart, who does not know that situations like-wise occur in life, in which it is equally impossible for a girl of virtue and tenderness to resist the arts of the man who has completely gained her affections.\n\nThe mentioning of this circumstance leads us to consider another species of seduction, which, though not so highly criminal as the former, is yet far removed from innocence; we mean the practice which is too prevalent among young men of fortune of employing every art in their power to gain the hearts of heedless girls whom they resolve neither to marry nor to rob of their honour. Should a man adhere to the latter part of this resolution, which is more than common fortitude can always promise for itself, the injury which he does to the object of his amusement is yet very great, as he raises hopes of the most sanguine kind merely to disappoint them, and diverts her affections perhaps for ever from such men as, had they been fixed on one of them, might have rendered her completely happy. Disappointments of this kind have sometimes been fatal to the unhappy girl; and even when they have neither deprived her of life, nor disordered her reason, they have often kept her wholly from marriage, which, whatever it be to a man, is that from which every woman expects her chief happiness. We cannot therefore conclude this article more properly than with warning our female readers not to give up their hearts hastily to men whose station in life is much higher than their own; and we beg leave to allure every one of them, that the man who solicits the last favour under the most solemn promise of a subsequent marriage, is a base seducer, who prefers a momentary gratification of his own to her honour and happiness through life, and has no intention to fulfil his promise. Or, if he should by any means be compelled to fulfil it, the may depend upon much ill treatment in return for her premature compliance with his base desires.\n\nSEDUM, orpine, a genus of plants belonging to the decandria clasps, and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, Succulentae.

He sowed them in pots within a framing; and as every one of them grew, he sent orders to his sons, who were at that time abroad, to pack up all kinds of seeds they could procure, in absorbent paper, and send some of them surrounded by raisins, and others by brown molasses sugar; concluding, that the preservation of the former seeds had been owing to a peculiarly favourable state of the moisture thus afforded them. He likewise concluded that, as many of our common seeds, such as clover, charlock, &c. would lie dormant for ages within the earth, well preserved for vegetation whenever they were thrown into its surface, and exposed to the influence of the atmosphere, so likewise might these foreign seeds be equally preserved, at least for many months, by the kindly covering and genial moisture afforded them by sugar or raisins. This opinion was fully verified, as not one in twenty of them failed to vegetate, while the same species of seeds sent home in common parcels along with them, did not vegetate at all. Having examined them prior to their being committed to the earth, he observed that there was a prevailing dryness in the latter, while the former looked healthy and fresh, not being in the smallest degree infested by insects, as was the case with the others. It has been repeatedly tried to convey seeds closed up in bottles, but this method has failed of success, a larger proportion of air, as well as a proper state of moisture, perhaps being necessary. It may be requisite to observe, that no difference was made in the package of the seeds, respecting their being kept in hucks, pods, &c. so as to give those preserved in raisins or sugar any advantage over the others, the whole being sent equally guarded by their natural teguments.\n\nSEEDY, in the brandy trade, a term used by the dealers to denote a fault that is found in several parcels of French brandy, which renders them unpalatable. The French suppose that these brandies obtain the flavour which they express by this name, from seeds that grow among the vines from whence the wine of which this brandy is pressed was made.\n\nSEEING, the perceiving of external objects by means of the eye. For an account of the organs of sight, and the nature of vision, see ANATOMY and OPTICS Index.\n\nSEEKS, a religious sect settled at Patna, and so called from a word contained in one of the commandments of their founder, which signifies learn thou. In books giving an account of oriental sects and oriental customs, we find mention made both of Seeks and Seiks; and we are strongly inclined to think that the same tribe is meant to be denominated by both words. If so, different authors write very differently of their principles and manners. We have already related something of the character of the Seiks under the article HINDOS; but in the Asiatic Researches, Mr Wilkins gives a much more amiable account of the Seeks, which we lay before our readers with pleasure.\n\nThe Seeks are a sect distinguished both from the Muslims and the worshippers of Brahma; and, from our author's account of them, must be an amiable people. He asked leave to enter into their chapel: They said it was a place of worship, open to all men, but intimated that he must take off his shoes. On complying with this ceremony, he was politely conducted into the hall, and seated upon a carpet in the midst of the assembly. The whole building forms a square of about 40 feet. The hall is in the centre, divided from four other apartments by wooden arches, upon pillars of the same materials. The walls above the arches were hung with European looking-glasses in gilt frames, and with pictures. On the left hand, as one enters, is the chancel, which is furnished with an altar covered with cloth of gold, raised a little above the ground in a declining position. About it were several flower-pots and rose-water bottles, and three urns to receive the donations of the charitable. On a low desk, near the altar, stood a great book, of folio size, from which some portions are daily read in the divine service. When notice was given that it was noon, the congregation arranged themselves upon the carpet on each side of the hall. The great book and desk were brought from the altar, and placed at the opposite extremity. An old silver-haired man kneeled down before the desk, with his face towards the altar, and by him sat a man with a drum, and two or three with cymbals. The book was now opened, and the old man began to chant to the time of the instruments, and at the conclusion of every verse most of the congregation joined chorus in a response, with countenances exhibiting great marks of joy. Their tones were not harsh; the time was quick; and Mr Wilkins learned that the subject was a hymn in praise of the unity, omnipresence, and omnipotence of the Deity. The hymn concluded, the whole company got up and presented their faces, with joined hands, towards the altar in the attitude of prayer. The prayer was a sort of litany pronounced by a young man in a loud and distinct voice; the people joining, at certain periods, in a general response. This prayer was followed by a short blessing from the old man, and an invitation to the assembly to partake of a friendly feast. A share was offered to Mr Wilkins, who was too polite to refuse it. It was a kind of sweetmeat composed of sugar and flour mixed up with clarified butter. They were next served with a few sugar plums; and thus ended the feast and ceremony.\n\nIn the course of conversation Mr Wilkins learned that the founder of this sect was Nanek Sah, who lived about 400 years ago; who left behind him a book, composed by himself in verse, containing the doctrines he had established; that this book teaches, that there is but one God, filling all space, and pervading all matter; and that there will be a day of retribution, when virtue will be rewarded, and vice punished. (Our author forgot to ask in what manner). It forbids murder, theft, and such other deeds as are by the majority of mankind esteemed crimes, and inculcates the practice of all the virtues; but, particularly, a universal philanthropy and hospitality to strangers and travellers. It not only commands universal toleration, but forbids disputes with those of another persuasion. If any show a sincere inclination to be admitted among them, any five or more Seeks being assembled in any place, even on the highway, they tend to the first shop where sweetmeats\nmeats are sold, and procure a very small quantity of a particular kind called *beul* (Mr Wilkins does not tell us of what it is composed), which having diluted in pure water, they sprinkle some of it on the body and eyes of the proselyte, whilst one of the beul instructed repeats to him the chief canons of their faith, and exacts from him a solemn promise to abide by them the rest of his life. They offered to admit Mr Wilkins into their society; but he declined the honour, contenting himself with their alphabet, which they told him to guard as the apple of his eye, as it was a sacred character. Mr Wilkins finds it but little different from the Dianagarai. The language itself is a mixture of Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit, grafted upon the provincial dialect of Punjab, which is a kind of Hindustani, or, as we commonly call it, Moors.\n\n**SEGALIEN**, a large island separated from the coast of Chinese Tartary by a narrow channel. It is called Tchoka by the natives, and Oku-Jefu by the Chinese. It is situated between 46° and 54° N. Lat.; but its breadth from east to west is unknown. The frigates under the command of Peroufe came to anchor in different bays, to the finest of which, in 48° 59' N. Lat. and 140° 32' E. Long., from Paris, the French commodore gave the name of Baie d'Estaing.\n\nSegalien is well wooded, and mountainous towards the centre, but flat and level along the coast, the soil of which is peculiarly favourable to agriculture; and vegetation is extremely vigorous. The whole surface is almost covered with forests of pine, birch, oak, and willow trees; and the seas, rivers, and brooks, abound with excellent salmon and trout. In general, the weather is mild and foggy; and the inhabitants are healthy and strong, and many of them live to an extreme old age. The presents received by the natives from the French, were only valued in proportion to their utility. They make use of looms, which are complete instruments, though small. The inhabitants in general do not exceed five feet in height, although some of the tallest measure about five feet four inches. Their countenances are animated and agreeable; their cheeks are large, their nose rounded at the extremity; they have strong voices, and rather thick lips, which are of a dull red.\n\nThe women are not so tall as the men, but of a more rounded and delicate form, with dresses nearly similar; their upper lip is tattooed all over of a blue colour; the hair of their head is black, smooth, and of a moderate strength, worn about six inches long behind, and they cut it into a brush on the top of their head and over the temples. They wear turbans of skin or quilted nankeen, which reaches to the calf of the leg, and sometimes lower, by which the use of drawers is in a great measure rendered unnecessary. They all wear girdles, like the lower orders among the Chinese, from which a knife is suspended as a defence against the bears, and a number of small pockets for holding their flint and steel, pipe and box of tobacco, for they are very great smokers. Their huts are small in proportion to the number of inhabitants they contain, but sufficient to defend them against the rain and other inclemencies of the atmosphere. The roofs consist of two inclined planes, from 10 to 12 feet high at their union, and three or four on the sides; the breadth of the roof is 15, and its length 18 feet. They use iron pots in cooking, also shells, vessels made of wood and birch bark, of different forms and workmanship. They have two meals a-day, the one at noon, and the other in the evening. Each family has its own hunting and fishing implements, and their arms are bows, javelins, and a kind of spontoon, which last is employed in hunting the bear.\n\nThe only domestic animals are dogs, of a middling size, with shaggy hair, pricked ears, and a long sharp muzzle, with a loud but not savage cry.\n\nThe people of Segalien are of a mild and unsuspicious disposition, and appear to hold a commercial intercourse with the Chinese through the medium of the Manchu Tartars, with the Ruffians to the north of their island, and the Japanese to the south; but the articles of trade consist only of a few furs and whale oil.\n\n**SEGERBERG**, a town of Germany, in the duchy of Holstein, and in Wagria; with a castle standing on a high mountain, consisting of limestone, large quantities of which are carried to Hamburg and Lubeck. It belongs to Denmark, and is seated on the river Treve, in E. Long. 10° 9'. N. Lat. 54° 0'.\n\n**SEGEDIN**, a strong town of Lower Hungary, in the county of Csongrad, with a castle. The Imperialists took it from the Turks in 1686. It is seated at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros, in E. Long. 20° 35'. N. Lat. 46° 28'.\n\n**SEGMENT of a Circle**, in Geometry, is that part of the circle contained between a chord and an arch of the same circle.\n\n**SEGMENTS, Line of**, two particular lines on Gunter's sector. They lie between the lines of fines and superficies, and are numbered, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. They represent the diameter of a circle, so divided into 100 parts, that a right line drawn through these parts, and perpendicular to the diameter, shall cut the circle into two segments, the greater of which shall have the same proportion to the whole circle, as the parts cut off have to 100.\n\n**SEGNA**, a city of Croatia, belonging to the house of Austria, and seated on the coast of the gulf of Venice. It was formerly a place of strength and great importance; but it has suffered many calamities, and its inhabitants at present do not amount to 7000. In the beginning of this century it sent 50 merchant ships to sea; but the inconvenience of its situation and badness of its harbour, in which the sea is never calm, discouraged navigation, and Segna has now very few ships belonging to it. Among the customs of the Segnans, Mr Fortis mentions one relative to the dead, which for its singularity may be worthy of notice.\n\n\"All the relations and friends of the family go to Fortis' kis the corpse, by way of taking leave, before burial. Each of them uncovers the face, over which a handkerchief is spread, more or less rich according to the family; having kissed the dead person, every one throws another handkerchief over the face; all which remain to the heirs, and sometimes there are 20, 30, and more at this ceremony. Some throw all these handkerchiefs into the grave with the corpse; and this, in former times, was the general custom; but then they were rich. This seems to have been brought into use as a substitute for the ancient *wasi lacrymatorii*.\" E. Long. 15° 21'. N. Lat. 45° 22'.\n\n**SENI**, an ancient town of Italy, in the Campagna\nof Rome, with a bishop's see, and the title of duchy. It is said that organs were first invented here. It is seated on a mountain. E. Long. 13° 15'. N. Lat. 41° 50'.\n\nSEGO, the metropolis of the kingdom of Bambarra in Africa, on the banks of the Niger, in N. Lat. 14° 4' and W. Long. 2° 1'. It consists of four distinct towns, two on the northern bank of the river, called Sego Korro, and Sego Boo; and two on the southern bank, called Sego Soo Korro, and Sego See Korro, all surrounded by lofty mud walls, and the houses are constructed of clay, several of them two stories high, and even white-washed. Mosques are to be seen in every quarter, and the streets, though narrow, are sufficiently broad for every useful purpose, where wheel-carriages are wholly unknown. According to Mr Park, the inhabitants of Sego amount to 30,000; and it is the constant residence of the king of Bambarra, a considerable part of whose revenue arises from the fare given by passengers for crossing the river. The people, however, are not so hospitable as in many other African towns, as the Moors are here very numerous, whose bigotry renders them the implacable enemies of every white man, if suspected of being a Christian.\n\nMr Park being therefore prohibited from living in Sego, resided for three days in an adjacent village, and was dismissed on the fourth, after receiving 5000 cowries from the king, to enable him to buy provisions in the course of his journey; and although it amounted only to 20s. sterling, so very cheap were the necessaries of life in Bambarra, that he found it sufficient to procure provisions for himself, and corn for his horse, for not fewer than 50 days.\n\nSEGORBE, a town of Spain, in the kingdom of Valencia, with the title of a duchy, and a bishop's see. It is seated on the side of a hill, between the mountains, in a soil very fertile in corn and wine, and where there are quarries of fine marble. It was taken from the Moors in 1245; and the Romans thought it worth their while to carry some of the marble to Rome. W. Long. 0° 3'. N. Lat. 39° 48'.\n\nSEGOVIA, an ancient city of Spain, of great power in the time of the Caesars, is built upon two hills near the banks of the Arayza in Old Castile. W. Long. 3° 48'. N. Lat. 41° 0'. It is still a bishop's see, and is distinguished for some venerable remains of antiquity. In the year 1525 the city contained 5000 families, but now they do not surpass 2000, a scanty population for 25 parishes; yet, beside 21 churches and a cathedral, there are 21 convents.\n\nThe first object in Segovia that attracts the eye is the aqueduct, which the singular situation of the city renders necessary. As it is built upon two hills, and the valley by which they are separated, and extends considerably in every direction, it was difficult for a part of the citizens to be supplied with water. The difficulty was removed, according to the opinion of the learned, in the reign of Trajan, by this aqueduct, which is one of the most astonishing and the best preserved of the Roman works. In the opinion of Mr Swinburne, who surveyed it in 1776, and who seems to have given a very accurate account of the curiosities of Segovia, it is superior in elegance of proportion to the Pont du Gard at Nîmes. It is so perfectly well preserved, that it does not seem leaky in any part. From the first low arches to the reservoir in the town, its length is 2400 Spanish feet; its greatest height (in the Plaza del Azoguejo at the foot of the walls) is 124; it is there composed of a double row of arches, built of large square stones without mortar, and over them a hollow wall of coarser materials for the channel of the water, covered with large oblong flags. Of the lower range of arcades, which are 15 feet wide by 65 high, there are 42. The upper arches are 119 in number, their height 27 Spanish feet, their breadth seventeen, the transversal thicknesses, or depth of the piers, eight feet.\n\nThe cathedral is a mixture of the Gothic and Moorish architecture. The inside is very spacious and of majestic simplicity. The windows are well disposed, and the great altar has been lately decorated with the finest Spanish Grenadan marble. But it is to be regretted, that in this cathedral, as well as in most others of Spain, the choir is placed in the middle of the nave. The church is nearly upon the model of the great church of Salamanca, but it is not so highly finished.\n\nThe alcazar, or ancient palace of the Moors, stands in one of the finest positions possible, on a rock rising above the open country. A fine river washes the foot of the precipice, and the city lies admirably well on each side on the brow of the hill; the declivity is woody, and the banks charmingly rural, the snowy mountains and dark forests of Saint Ildefonso compose an awful back-ground to the picture. Towards the town there is a large court before the great outward tower, which, as the prison of Gil Blas, is so well described by Le Sage, that the subject requires no farther explanation. The rest of the buildings form an antique palace, which has seldom been inhabited by any but prisoners since the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, who were much attached to this situation. There are some magnificent halls in it, with much gilding in the ceilings, in a barbarous taste. All the kings of Spain are seated in state along the cornice of the great falcon; but it is doubtful whether they are like the princes whose names they bear; if that resemblance, however, be wanting, they have no other merit to claim. The royal apartments are now occupied by a college of young gentlemen cadets, educated at the king's expense in all the sciences requisite for forming an engineer. The grandmaster of the ordnance resides at Segovia, which is the head establishment of the Spanish artillery.\n\nThe mint is below the alcazar, a large building, the most ancient place of coinage in the kingdom. The machines for melting, flanging, and milling the coin, are worked by water; but there is reason to believe that Seville has at present more business, as being nearer the source of riches, the port of Cadiz, where the ingots of America are landed.\n\nThe unevenness of the crown of the hill gives a wild look to this city. Most of the streets are crooked and dirty, the houses wooden and very wretched; nor do the inhabitants appear much the richer for their cloth manufacture. Indeed, it is not in a very flourishing condition, but what cloth they make is very fine.\n\nThe country about Segovia has the reputation of being the best for rearing the kind of sheep that produces the beautiful Spanish wool; but as those flocks wander over many other parts of the kingdom, Segovia seems to have no exclusive title to this reputation. Segovia (says Mr Townend, whose valuable travels will be read with much pleasure) was once famous for its cloth made on the\nSegovia, New, a town of North America, in New Spain, and in the audience of Guatimala; seated on the river Yare, on the confines of the province of Honduras.

See Botany Index.\n\nSejant, a term used in heraldry, when a lion, or other beast, is drawn in an escutcheon fitting like a cat with his fore-feet straight.\n\nSejanus, Aelius, a native of Vulcinum in Tuscany, who distinguished himself in the court of Tiberius. His father's name was Seius Strabo; a Roman knight, commander of the pretorian guards. His mother was descended from the Junian family. Sejanus first gained the favour of Caius Caesar, the grandson of Augustus, but afterwards he attached himself to the interest and the views of Tiberius, who then sat on the imperial throne. The emperor, who was naturally of a suspicious temper, was free and open with Sejanus, and while he distrusted others, he communicated his greatest secrets to this fawning favourite. Sejanus improved this confidence; and when he had found that he possessed the esteem of Tiberius, he next endeavoured to become the favourite of the soldiers, and the darling of the senate. As commander of the pretorian guards he was the second man in Rome, and in that important office he made use of insinuations and every mean artifice to make himself beloved and revered. His affability and condensation gained him the hearts of the common soldiers, and, by appointing his own favourites and adherents to places of trust and honour, all the officers and centurions of the army became devoted to his interest. The views of Sejanus in this were well known; yet, to advance with more success, he attempted to gain the affection of the senators. In this he met with no opposition. A man who has the disposal of places of honour and dignity, and who has the command of the public money, cannot but be the favourite of those who are in need of his affluence. It is even said, that Sejanus gained to his views all the wives of the senators, by a private and most sacred promise of marriage to each of them, whenever he had made himself independent and sovereign of Rome. Yet, however successful with the best and noblest families in the empire, Sejanus had to combat numbers in the house of the emperor; but these seeming obstructions were soon removed. All the children and grandchildren of Tiberius were sacrificed to the ambition of the favourite under various pretences; and Drusus the son of the emperor, by striking Sejanus, made his destruction sure and inevitable. Livia, the wife of Drusus, was gained by Sejanus; and, though the mother of many children, she was prevailed upon to assist her adulterer in the murder of her husband, and she consented to marry him when Drusus was dead. No sooner was Drusus poisoned, than Sejanus openly declared his wish to marry Livia. This was strongly opposed by Tiberius; and the emperor, by recommending Germanicus to the senators for his successor, rendered Sejanus bold and determined. He was more urgent in his demands; and, when he could not gain the consent of the emperor, he persuaded him to retire to solitude from the noise of Rome and the troubles of the government. Tiberius, naturally fond of ease and luxury, yielded to his representations, and retired to Campania, leaving Sejanus at the head of the empire. This was highly gratifying to the favourite, but he was not without a master. Prudence and moderation might have made him what he wished to be; but having offended the emperor beyond forgiveness, he resolved to retrieve his loss, and by one vigorous effort to decide the fate of the empire. He called together his friends and followers; he paid court to such as seemed disaffected; he held forth rewards and promises; and, having increased the number of his partisans, formed a bold conspiracy, resolved by any means to seize the sovereign power.\n\nA powerful league was formed with astonishing rapidity, and great numbers of all descriptions, senators as well as military men, entered into the plot. Among these, Satrius Secundus was the confidential friend and prime agent of the minister. Whatever was this man's motive, whether fear, or views of interest, or ingratitude (for no principle of honour can be imputed to him), he resolved to betray the secret to Tiberius. For this purpose he addressed himself to Antonia, the daughter of Anthony the triumvir, the widow of Drusus, and the mother of Germanicus. When this illustrious woman, who was honoured by the court and revered by the people, heard the particulars, she sent dispatches to the emperor by one of her slaves. Tiberius was astonished, but not dismayed. The danger pressed; his habitual slovenliness was out of fashion; the time called for vigour and decisive measures. He sent Macro to Rome, with a special commission to take upon him the command of the pretorian guards. He added full instructions for\nhis conduct in all emergencies. Early in the morning on the 15th, before the kalends of November, a report was spread, that letters had arrived at Rome, in which the emperor signified his intentions to associate Sejanus with himself in the tribunitian power. The senate was summoned to meet in the temple of Apollo, near the imperial palace. Sejanus attended without delay. A party of the praetorians followed him. Macro met him in the vestibule of the temple. He approached the minister with all demonstrations of profound respect, and taking him aside, \"Be not surprized (he said) that you have no letter from the prince; it is his pleasure to declare you his colleague in the tribunitian power; but he thinks that a matter of so much importance should be communicated to the fathers by the voice of the consuls. I am going to deliver the emperor's orders,\" Sejanus, elated with joy, and flushed with his new dignity, entered the senate-house; Macro followed him. As soon as the consuls arrived, he delivered the letter from Tiberius, and immediately went forth to the praetorian guards. He informed them, that by order of the prince, a large donative was to be distributed among the soldiers. He added, that, by a new commission, he himself was appointed their commanding officer; and, if they followed him to the camp, they would there receive the promised bounty. The lure was not thrown out in vain: the praetorian guards quitted their station. Laco, who stood near at hand, immediately surrounded the senate-house with a body of the city cohorts.\n\nThe letter to the consuls was confused, obscure, and tedious, only glancing at Sejanus, till at last the language of invective left no room for doubt. Sejanus kept his seat like a man benumbed, senseless and stupid with astonishment. His friends, who a little before congratulated him on his new dignity, deserted him on every side. He was commanded by the consul to rise and follow him, and being loaded with irons, was conducted to prison. His downfall filled the city with exultation. The populace, who worshipped him in the hour of prosperity, rejoiced to see the sad catastrophe to which he was now reduced. They followed in crowds, rending the air with shouts, and pouring forth a torrent of abuse and scurrilous language. The prisoner endeavoured to hide his face; but the mob delighted to see remorse and shame and guilt and horror in every feature of his distracted countenance. They reviled him for his acts of cruelty; they laughed at his wild ambition; they tore down his images, and dashed his statues to pieces. He was doomed by Tiberius to suffer death on that very day; but, as he had a powerful faction in the senate, it was not thought advisable, for the mere formality of a regular condemnation, to hazard a debate. Private orders were given to Macro to dispatch him without delay; but the consul, seeing the dispositions of the people, and the calm neutrality of the praetorian guards, judged it best to re-assemble the fathers. They met in the temple of Concord. With one voice Sejanus was condemned to die, and the sentence was executed without delay. He was strangled in the prison. His body was dragged to the Gemonice, and, after every species of insult from the populace, at the end of three days was thrown into the Tiber. Such was the tragic end of that ambitious favourite. He fell a terrible example to all, who, in any age or country, may hereafter endeavour by their vices to rise above their fellow-citizens.\n\nSEIGNIOR, is, in its general signification, the same with lord, but is particularly used for the lord of the fee as of a manor, as seigneur among the feudists; is he who grants a fee or benefit out of the land to another; and the reason is, because having granted away the use and profit of the land, the property or dominion he still retains in himself.\n\nSEIGNIORAGE, is a royalty or prerogative of the king, whereby he claims an allowance of gold and silver brought in the mals to be exchanged for coin. As feigniorage, put of every pound weight of gold, the king had for his coin, 3s. of which he paid to the master of the mint sometimes 1s. and sometimes 1s. 6d. Upon every pound weight of silver, the feigniorage answered to the king in the time of Edward III. was 18 pennyweights, which then amounted to about 1s. out of which he sometimes paid 8d. at others 9d. to the master. In the reign of King Henry V. the king's feigniorage of every pound of silver was 15d. &c.\n\nSEIGNIORY, is borrowed from the French seigneurie, i.e. dominatus, imperium, principatus; and signifies with us a manor or lordship, seigniory de fekemans. Seigniory in gros, seems to be the title of him who is not lord by means of any manor, but immediately in his own person; as tenure in capite, whereby one holds of the king, as of his crown, is seigniory in gros.\n\nSEIKS. See HINDOSTAN.\n\nSEISIN, in Law, signifies possession. In this sense we say, premier seisir, for the first possession, &c.\n\nSeisin is divided into that in deed or in fact, and that in law. A seisir in deed is where a possession is actually taken: but a seisir in law is, where lands descend, and the party has not entered thereon; or, in other words, it is where a person has a right to lands, &c., and is by wrong disfranchised of them. A seisir in law is held to be sufficient to avow on; though to the bringing of an affidavit, actual seisir is required; and where seisir is alleged, the person pleading it must show of what estate he is seised, &c.\n\nSeisin of a superior service is deemed to be a seisir of all superior and casual services that are incident thereto; and seisir of a lessor for years, is sufficient for him in reversion.\n\nLivery of SEISIN, in Law, an essential ceremony in the conveyance of landed property; being no other than the pure feudal investiture, or delivery of corporeal possession of the land or tenement. This was held absolutely necessary to complete the donation; Nam feudum sine investitura nullo modo confiri potuit: and an estate was then only perfect when, as Fleta expresses it in our law, fit juris et seisin conjunctio. See FLORMENT.\n\nInvestitures, in their original rite, were probably intended to demonstrate in conquered countries the actual possession of the lord; and that he did not grant a bare litigious right, which the fiddler was ill qualified to prosecute, but a peaceable and firm possession. And, at a time when writing was seldom practised, a mere oral gift, at a distance from the spot that was given, was not likely to be either long or accurately retained in the memory of bystanders, who were very little interested in the grant. Afterwards they were retained as a public and notorious act, that the country might take notice of and testify\ntestify the transfer of the estate; and that such as claimed title by other means might know against whom to bring their actions.\n\nIn all well governed nations, some notoriety of this kind has been ever held requisite, in order to acquire and ascertain the property of lands. In the Roman law, plenum dominium was not said to subsist unless where a man had both the right and the corporal possession; which possession could not be acquired without both an actual intention to possess, and an actual seizin or entry into the premises, or part of them in the name of the whole. And even in ecclesiastical promotions, where the freehold passes to the person promoted, corporal possession is required at this day to vest the property completely in the new proprietor; who, according to the distinction of the canonists, acquires the jus ad rem, or inchoate and imperfect right, by nomination and institution; but not the jus in re, or complete and full right, unless by corporal possession. Therefore in dignities possession is given by intimation; in rectories and vicarages by induction; without which no temporal rights accrue to the minister, though every ecclesiastical power is vested in him by institution. So also even in defeasants of lands, by our law, which are cast on the heir by act of the law itself, the heir has not plenum dominium, or full and complete ownership, till he has made an actual corporal entry into the lands: for if he dies before entry made, his heir shall not be entitled to take the possession, but the heir of the person who was last actually seised. It is not therefore only a mere right to enter, but the actual entry, that makes a man complete owner; so as to transmit the inheritance to his own heirs: non jus, sed feisina, facit stipitem.\n\nYet the corporal tradition of lands being sometimes inconvenient, a symbolical delivery of possession was in many cases anciently allowed; by transferring something near at hand, in the presence of credible witnesses, which by agreement should serve to represent the very thing designed to be conveyed; and an occupancy of this sign or symbol was permitted as equivalent to occupancy of the land itself. Among the Jews we find the evidence of a purchase thus defined in the book of Ruth: \"Now this was the manner in former time in Israel, concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things: a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was a testimony in Israel.\" Among the ancient Goths and Swedes, contracts for the sale of lands were made in the presence of witnesses, who extended the cloak of the buyer, while the seller cast a clod of the land into it, in order to give possession; and a staff or wand was also delivered from the vender to the vendee, which passed through the hands of the witnesses. With our Saxon ancestors the delivery of a turf was a necessary solemnity to establish the conveyance of lands. And, to this day, the conveyance of our copyhold estates is usually made from the seller to the lord or his steward by delivery of a rod or verge, and then from the lord to the purchaser by re-delivery of the same in the presence of a jury of tenants.\n\nConveyances in writing were the last and most refined improvement. The mere delivery of possession, either actual or symbolical, depending on the ocular testimony and remembrance of the witnesses, was liable to be forgotten or misrepresented, and became frequent-\nmust be as many trials as there are counties, and the jury of one county are no judges of the notoriety of a fact in another. Besides, anciently, this seisin was obliged to be delivered coram paribus de vicinco, before the peers or freeholders of the neighbourhood, who attested such delivery in the body or on the back of the deed; according to the rule of the feudal law, Pares debent inter se invictere feudi, et non ali: for which this reason is expressly given; because the peers or vassals of the lord, being bound by their oath of fealty, will take care that no fraud be committed to his prejudice, which strangers might be apt to connive at. And though afterwards the ocular attestation of the pares was held unnecessary, and livery might be made before any credible witnesses, yet the trial, in case it was disputed, (like that of all other attestations), was still referred to the pares or jury of the county. Also, if the lands be out on lease, though all lie in the same county, there must be as many liversies as there are tenants: because no livery can be made in this case, but by the consent of the particular tenant; and the consent of one will not bind the rest. And in all these cases it is prudent, and usual, to endorse the livery of seisin on the back of the deed, specifying the manner, place, and time of making it; together with the names of the witnesses. And thus much for livery in deed.\n\nLivery in law is where the same is not made on the land, but in sight of it only; the feoffor saying to the feoffee, \"I give you yonder land, enter and take possession.\" Here, if the feoffee enters during the life of the feoffor, it is a good livery, but not otherwise; unless he dares not enter through fear of his life or bodily harm; and then his continual claim, made yearly in due form of law, as near as possible to the lands, will suffice without an entry. This livery in law cannot, however, be given or received by attorney, but only by the parties themselves.\n\nSEIZE, in the sea-language, is to make fast or bind, particularly to fasten two ropes together with rope-yarn. The seizing of a boat is a rope tied to a ring or little chain in the fore-ship of the boat, by which means it is fastened to the side of the ship.\n\nSEIZURE, in commerce, an arrest of some merchandise, moveable, or other matter, either in consequence of some law or of some express order of the sovereign. Contraband goods, those fraudulently entered, or landed without entering at all, or at wrong places, are subject to seizure. In seizures among us, one half goes to the informer, and the other half to the king.\n\nSELAGO, a genus of plants belonging to the dilynamia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 48th order, Aggregatae. See Botany Index.\n\nSELDEN, JOHN, called by Grotius the glory of England, was born at Salvington in Sussex in 1584. He was educated at the free school at Chichester; whence he was sent to Hart Hall in the university of Oxford, where he staid four years. In 1612, he entered himself in Clifford's Inn, in order to study the law; and about two years after removed to the Inner Temple, where he soon acquired great reputation by his learning. He had already published several of his works; and this year wrote verses in Latin, Greek, and English, upon Mr William Browne's Britannia's Pastors.\n\nIn 1614, he published his Titles of Honour; and in Selden. 1616, his Notes on Sir John Fortescue's book De Legibus Legum Anglicae. In 1618, he published his History of Tythes; which gave great offence to the clergy, and was animadverted upon by several writers; and for that book he was called before the high commission court, and obliged to make a public acknowledgment of his sorrow for having published it. In 1621, being sent for by the parliament, though he was not then a member of that house, and giving his opinion very strongly in favour of their privileges in opposition to the court, he was committed to the custody of the sheriff of London, but was set at liberty after five weeks confinement. In 1623, he was chosen burgess for Lancaster; but, amidst all the divisions of the nation, kept himself neutral, prosecuting his studies with such application, that though he was the next year chosen reader of Lyon's Inn, he refused to perform that office. In 1625, he was chosen burgess for Great Bedwin in Wiltshire, to serve in the first parliament of King Charles I., in which he declared himself warmly against the duke of Buckingham; and on his Grace's being impeached by the House of Commons, was appointed one of the managers of the articles against him. In 1627 and 1628, he opposed the court party with great vigour. The parliament being prorogued to January 25, 1629, Mr Selden retired to the earl of Kent's house at Wrotham, Bedfordshire, where he finished his Marmora Arundeliana. The parliament being met, he, among others, again distinguished himself by his zeal against the court; when the king dissolving the parliament, ordered several of the members to be brought before the King's Bench bar, and committed to the Tower. Among these was Mr Selden, who insisting on the benefit of the laws, and refusing to make his submission, was removed to the King's Bench prison. Being here in danger of his life on account of the plague then raging in Southwark, he petitioned the lord high treasurer, at the end of Trinity term, to intercede with his Majesty that he might be removed to the Gate-house, Westminster, which was granted; but in Michaelmas term following, the judges objecting to the lord treasurer's warrant, by which he had been removed to the Gate-house, an order was made for conveying him back to the King's Bench, whence he was released in the latter end of the same year; but fifteen years after, the parliament ordered him to pay for the losses he had sustained on this occasion. He was afterwards committed with several other gentlemen, for dispersing a libel; but the author, who was abroad, being discovered, they were at length set at liberty. In 1634, a dispute arising between the English and Dutch concerning the herring fishery on the British coast, he was prevailed upon by Archbishop Laud to draw up his More Claustrum, in answer to Grotius's Mare Liberum: which greatly recommended him to the favour of the court. In 1640, he was chosen member for the university of Oxford; when he again opposed the court, though he might, by complying, have raised himself to very considerable posts. In 1643, he was appointed one of the lay-members to sit in the assembly of divines at Westminster, and was the same year appointed keeper of the records in the Tower. Whilst he attended his duty in the assembly, a warm debate arose reflecting the distance of Jericho from Jerusalem. The party which contended for the shortest distance, urged, as a proof\nproof of their opinion being well founded, that fishes were carried from the one city to the other, and sold in the market. Their adversaries were ready to yield to the force of this conclusive argument, when Selden, who despised both parties, as well as the frivolousness of their dispute, exclaimed, \"Perhaps the fishes were fished!\" This unexpected remark left the victory doubtful, and renewed the debate; and our author, who was sick of such trifling, soon found employment more suited to his genius; for, in 1645, he was made one of the commissioners of the admiralty. The same year he was unanimously elected master of Trinity college, Cambridge; but declined accepting. He died in 1654; and was interred in the Temple-church, where a monument is erected to his memory. Dr Wilkes observes, that he was a man of uncommon gravity and greatness of soul, averse to flattery, liberal to scholars, charitable to the poor; and though he had great latitude in his principles with regard to ecclesiastical power, yet he had a sincere regard for the church of England.

It is called also Seleucia ad Tigriem, (Polybius, Strabo, Isidorus Characenus); washed on the south by the Euphrates, on the east by the Tigris, (Theophylactus); generally agreed to have been built or enlarged by Seleucus Nicanor, master of the east after Alexander; by means of which Babylon came to be deserted. It is said to have been originally called Cochea (Amian, Eutropius); though others, as Arrian, differing with it, as a village, from Seleucia; and, according to Zosimus, the ancient name of Seleucia was Zochea. Now called Bagdad. E. Long. 44. 21. N. Lat. 33. 10. There were many other cities of the same name, all built by Seleucus Nicanor.\n\nSELEUCIDÆ, in Chronology. Era of the Seleucidæ, or the Syro-Macedonian era, is a computation of time, commencing from the establishment of the Seleucidæ, a race of Greek kings, who reigned as successors of Alexander the Great in Syria, as the Ptolemies did in Egypt. This era we find expressed in the books of the Maccabees, and on a great number of Greek medals struck by the cities of Syria, &c. The Rabbins call it the era of contracts, and the Arabs therib dikornain, that is, the \"era of the two horns.\" According to the best accounts, the first year of this era falls in the year 311 B.C. being 12 years after Alexander's death.\n\nSELEUCUS, NICANOR, one of the chief generals under Alexander the Great, and, after his death, founder of the race of princes called Seleucidæ. He is equally celebrated as a renowned warrior, and as the father of his people; yet his virtues could not protect him from the fatal ambition of Ceraunus, one of his courtiers, by whom he was assassinated 280 B.C.\n\nSELF-HEAL, the PRUNELLA VULGARIS, Lin. This herb was recommended by the older physicians as a mild refrigerant and vulnerary; but its virtues appear to be very feeble, and therefore it is now rarely used.\n\nSELF-Command, is that steady equanimity which enables a man in every situation to exert his reasoning faculty with coolness, and to do what the present circumstances require. It depends much upon the natural temperament of the body, and much upon the moral cultivation of the mind. He who enjoys good health, and has braced his frame by exercise, has always a greater command of himself than a man of equal mental powers, who has suffered his constitution to become relaxed by indolence; and he who has from his early youth been accustomed to make his passions submit to his reason, must, in any sudden emergency, be more capable of acting properly than he who has tamely yielded to his passion. Hence it is that recluse and literary men, when forced into the battle of public life, are incapable of acting where promptness is requisite; and that men who have once or twice yielded to a sense of impending danger seldom acquire afterwards that command of themselves which may be necessary to extricate them from subsequent dangers. In one of the earliest battles fought by the late king of Prussia, the sovereign was among the first men who quitted the field; had he behaved in the same manner a second and a third time, he would never have become that hero whose actions astonished Europe. A celebrated engineer among ourselves, who was well known to the writer of this short article, had little science, and was a stranger to the principles of his own art; but being possessed of a firm and vigorous frame, and having been accustomed to struggle with dangers and difficulties, he had such a constant command of himself, as enabled him to employ with great coolness every necessary resource in the day of battle.\n\nBut it is not only in battle, and in the face of immediate danger, that self-command is necessary to enable a man to act with propriety. There is no situation in life where difficulties, greater or less, are not to be encountered; and he who would pass through life with comfort to himself, and with utility to the public, must endeavour to keep his passions in constant subjection to his reason. No man can enjoy without uneasiness what he cannot lose without pain; and no man who is overwhelmed with despondency under any sudden misfortune can exert the talents necessary to retrieve his circumstances. We ought, therefore, by every means to endeavour to obtain a constant command of ourselves; and nowhere shall we find better lessons for this purpose than in ancient Lacedemon. There certain occupations were appointed for each sex, for every hour, and for every season of life. In a life always active, the passions have no opportunity to deceive, seduce, or corrupt; and the nervous system acquires a firmness which makes it a fit instrument to a vigorous mind.\n\nSELF-Defence implies not only the preservation of one's life, but also the protection of his property, because\ncaus without property life cannot be preserved in a civilized nation. The extent of property essential to life is indeed small, and this consideration may enable us to decide a question which some moralists have made intricate. By what means, has been asked, may a man protect his property? May he kill the person who attacks it, if he cannot otherwise repel the attack?\n\nThat a man, in the state of nature, may kill the person who makes an attack on his life, if he cannot otherwise repel the attack, is a truth which has never been controverted; and he may do the same in civil society, if his danger be so imminent that it cannot be averted by the interposition of the protection provided for individuals by the state. In all possible situations, except the three following, whatever is absolutely necessary to the preservation of life may be lawfully performed, for the law of self-preservation is the first and most sacred of those laws which are impressed on every mind by the author of nature.\n\nThe three excepted situations are those of a soldier in the day of battle, of a criminal about to suffer by the laws of his country, and of a man called upon to renounce his religion. The soldier hazards his life in the most honourable of all causes, and cannot betray his trust, or play the coward, without incurring a high degree of moral turpitude. He knows that the very profession in which he is engaged necessarily subjects him to danger; and he voluntarily incurred that danger for the good of his country, which, with great propriety, annexes to his profession peculiar privileges and much glory. The criminal under sentence of death cannot, without adding to his guilt, refuse the execution of that sentence; for the power of inflicting punishment is essential to society, and society is the ordinance of God (see Society). The man who is called upon to renounce his religion ought to submit to the cruellest death rather than comply with that request, since religion is his only security for future and permanent happiness. But in every other situation, that which is absolutely necessary to the preservation of life is undoubtedly lawful. Hence it is, that a person sinking in water is never thought to be guilty of any crime, though he drag his neighbour after him by his endeavours to save himself; and hence, too, a man in danger of perishing by shipwreck may drive another from a plank which cannot carry them both, for since one of two lives must be lost, no law, human or divine, calls upon either of them to prefer his neighbour's life to his own.\n\nBut though the rights of self-defence authorize us to repel every attack made upon our life, and in cases of extremity to save ourselves at the expense of the life of our innocent neighbour, it is not so evident that, rather than give to an unjust demand a few shillings or pounds, we may lawfully deprive a fellow creature of life, and the public of a citizen. A few pounds lost may be easily regained; but life when lost can never be recovered. If these pounds, indeed, be the whole of a man's property; if they include his clothes, his food, and the house where he shelters his head—there cannot be a doubt but that, rather than part with them, he may lawfully kill the aggressor, for no man can exist without shelter, food, and raiment. But it is seldom that an attempt is made, or is indeed practicable, to rob a man at once of all that he possesses. The question then of any importance is, May a man put a robber to death rather than part with a small part of his property? Mr Paley doubts whether he could innocently do so in a state of nature, \"because it cannot be contended to be for the augmentation of human happiness, that one man should lose his life or limb, rather than another a pennyworth of his property.\" He allows, that in civil society the life of the aggressor may be always taken away by the person aggrieved, or meant to be aggrieved, when the crime attempted is such as would subject its perpetrator to death by the laws of his country.\n\nIt is not often that we feel ourselves disposed to differ in opinion from this most valuable and intelligent writer; but on the present occasion we cannot help thinking that he does not reason with his usual precision. To us he even seems to lose sight of his own principles. No legislature can have a right to take away life in civil society, but in such cases as individuals have the same right in a state of nature. If therefore a man in the state of nature, have not a right to protect his property by killing the aggressor, when it cannot be otherwise protected, it appears to us self-evident that no legislature can have a right to inflict the punishment of death upon such offences; but if the laws inflicting death upon the crime of robbery be morally evil, it is certain that an individual cannot be innocent when he prevents robbery by the death of the robber, merely because he knows that the laws of his country have decreed that punishment against those convicted of that crime. But we think that the protection of property by the death of the aggressor may be completely vindicated upon more general principles. It is necessary, in every state, that property be protected, or mankind could not subsist; but in a state of nature every man must be the defender of his own property, which in that state must necessarily be small: and if he be not allowed to defend it by every mean in his power, he will not long be able to protect it at all. By giving him such liberty, a few individuals may, indeed, occasionally lose their lives and limbs for the preservation of a very small portion of private property; but we believe that the sum of human happiness will be more augmented by cutting off such worthless wretches than by exposing property to perpetual depredation; and therefore, if general utility be the criterion of moral good, we must be of opinion that a man may in every case lawfully kill a robber rather than comply with his unjust demand.\n\nBut if a man may without guilt preserve his property by the death of the aggressor, when it cannot be preserved by any other means, much more may a woman have recourse to the last extremity to protect her chastity from forcible violation. This, indeed, is admitted by Mr Paley himself, and will be controverted by no man who reflects on the importance of the female character, and the probable consequences of the smallest deviation from the established laws of female honour. See Seduction.\n\nSelf-Knowledge, the knowledge of one's own character, abilities, opinions, virtues, and vices. This has always been considered as a difficult though important acquisition. It is difficult, because it is disagreeable to investigate our errors, our faults, and vices; because we are apt to be partial to ourselves, even when we have done wrong; and because time and habitual attention are\nBut these difficulties are more than counterbalanced by the advantages of self-knowledge.\n\nBy knowing the extent of our abilities, we shall never rashly engage in enterprises where our ineffectual exertions may be productive of harm; by investigating our opinions, we may discover those which have no foundation, and those also which lead us insensibly into vice. By examining our virtues and vices, we shall learn what principles ought to be strengthened, and what habits ought to be removed.\n\nMan is a rational and intelligent being, capable of great improvement, and liable to great vices. If he act without examining his principles, he may be hurried by blind passion into crimes. If he aspire at noble and valuable acquisitions, he must act upon a plan, with deliberation and forethought; for he is not like a vegetable, which attains perfection by the influence of external causes: he has powers within himself which must be exerted, and exerted with judgement, in order to attain the perfection of his nature. To enable him to employ these powers aright, he must know, first, what is his duty; and, secondly, he must often review his principles and conduct, that he may discover whether he is performing his duty, or in what circumstances he has failed. When he finds that he has fallen into error and vice, he will naturally inquire what causes have produced this effect, that he may avoid the same for the time to come. This is the method by which every reformation in religion and science has been produced, and the method by which the arts have been improved. Before Lord Bacon introduced the new way of philosophizing, he must first have considered wherein true philosophy consisted; secondly, he must have inquired in what respects the ancient method of philosophizing was false or useless: and after determining these two points, he was qualified to describe the way by which the study of philosophy could be successfully pursued without deviating into hypotheses and error. Luther found out the errors of the church of Rome by comparing their doctrines with the Scriptures. But had this comparison never been made, the reformation could never have taken place. Without self-knowledge, or without that knowledge of our character which is derived from a comparison of our principles and conduct with a perfect standard of morality, we can never form plans and resolutions, or make any exertion to abandon the vicious habits which we have contracted, and strengthen those virtuous principles in which we are deficient.\n\nAs much may be learned from the errors of those who have been in similar situations with ourselves; so many useful cautions may be obtained from our own errors; and he that will remember these, will seldom be twice guilty of the same vice.\n\nIt was evidently the intention of Providence that man should be guided chiefly by experience. It is by the observations which we make on what we see passing around us, or from what we suffer in our own person, that we form maxims for the conduct of life. The more minutely therefore we attend to our principles, and the more maxims we form, we shall be the better fitted to attain moral perfection.\n\nWith respect to our understanding, to mark the errors which we have fallen into, either by its natural defects or by negligence, is also of great importance; for the greatest genius and most profound scholar are liable to these errors, and often commit them as well as the weak and illiterate. But by observing them, and tracing them to their causes, they at length acquire an habitual accuracy. It is true, that men of feeble minds can never by knowing their own defects exalt themselves to the rank of genius; but such knowledge will enable them to improve their understandings, and so to appreciate their own powers, as seldom to attempt what is beyond their strength. They may thus become useful members of society; and though they will not probably be admired for their abilities, they will yet escape the ridicule which is poured upon vanity.\n\nIt is difficult to lay down precise rules for the acquisition of this self-knowledge, because almost every man is blinded by a fallacy peculiar to himself. But when one has got rid of that partiality which arises from self-love, he may easily form a just estimate of his moral improvements, by comparing the general course of his conduct with the standard of his duty; and if he has any doubt of the extent of his intellectual attainments, he will most readily discover the truth by comparing them with the attainments of others who have been most successful in the same pursuits. Should vanity arise in his mind from such a comparison, let him then compare the extent of his knowledge with what is yet to be known, and he will then be in little danger of thinking of himself more highly than he ought to think. See Prejudice and Self-Partiality.\n\nSelf-Love, is that instinctive principle which impels every animal, rational and irrational, to preserve its life and promote its own happiness. It is very generally confounded with selfishness; but we think that the one propensity is distinct from the other. Every man loves himself; but every man is not selfish. The selfish man grasps at all immediate advantages, regardless of the consequences which his conduct may have upon his neighbour. Self-love only prompts him who is actuated by it to procure to himself the greatest possible sum of happiness during the whole of his existence. In this pursuit the rational self-lover will often forego a present enjoyment to obtain a greater and more permanent one in reverberation; and he will as often submit to a present pain to avoid a greater hereafter. Self-love, as distinguished from selfishness, always comprehends the whole of a man's existence, and in that extended sense of the phrase, we hesitate not to say that every man is a self-lover; for, with eternity in his view, it is surely not possible for the most disinterested of the human race not to prefer himself to all other men, if their future and everlasting interests could come into competition. This indeed they never can do; for though the introduction of evil into the world, and the different ranks which it makes necessary in society, put it in the power of a man to raise himself, in the present state, by the depression of his neighbour, or by the practice of injustice, yet in the pursuit of a prize which is to be gained only by benevolence, righteousness, and piety, there can be no rivalry among the different competitors. The success of one is no injury to another; and therefore, in this sense of the phrase, self-love is not only lawful, but absolutely unavoidable. It has been a question in morals, whether it be not likewise the incentive to every action, however virtuous or apparently disinterested?\nThose who maintain the affirmative side of this question say, that the prospect of immediate pleasure, or the dread of immediate pain, is the only apparent motive to action in the minds of infants, and indeed of all who look not before them, and infer the future from the past. They own, that when a boy has had some experience, and is capable of making comparisons, he will often decline an immediate enjoyment which he has formerly found productive of future evil more than equivalent to all its good; but in doing so they think, and they think justly, that he is still situated by the principle of self-love, pursuing the greatest good of which he knows himself to be capable. After experiencing that truth, equity, and benevolence in all his dealings is the readiest, and indeed the only certain method of securing to himself the kindness and good offices of his fellow creatures, and much more when he has learned that they will recommend him to the Supreme Being, upon whom depends his existence and all his enjoyments, they admit that he will practice truth, equity, and benevolence; but still, from the same principle, pursuing his own ultimate happiness as the object which he has always in view. The prospect of this great object will make him feel an exquisite pleasure in the performance of the actions which he conceives as necessary to its attainment, till at last, without attending in each instance to their consequences, he will, by the great associating principle which has been explained elsewhere (see Metaphysics, Part I. chap. i.) feel a refined enjoyment in the actions themselves, and perform them, as occasions offer, without deliberation or reflection. Such, they think, is the origin of benevolence itself, and indeed of every virtue.\n\nThose who take the other side of the question, can hardly deny that self-love thus modified may prompt to virtuous and apparently disinterested conduct; but they think it degrading the dignity of a man to suppose him actuated solely by motives which can be traced back to a desire of his own happiness. They observe, that the Author of our nature has not left the preservation of the individual, or the continuance of the species, to the deductions of our reason, computing the sum of happiness which the actions necessary to these ends produce to ourselves; on the contrary, He has taken care of both, by the sure impulse of instinct planted in us for these very purposes. And is it conceivable, say they, that He would leave the care of our fellow-creatures a matter of indifference, till each man should be able to discover or be taught that by loving his neighbour, and doing him all the good in his power, he would be most effectually promoting his own happiness? Is it dishonouring virtue, they continue, to make it proceed in any instance from a prospect of happiness, or a dread of misery; and they appeal from theory to fact, as exhibited in the conduct of savage tribes, who deliberate little on the consequences of their actions.\n\nTheir antagonists reply, that the conduct of savage tribes is to be considered as that of children in civilized nations, regulated entirely by the examples which they have before them; that their actions cannot be the offspring of innate instincts, otherwise savage virtues would, under similar circumstances, everywhere be the same, which is contrary to fact; that virtue proceeds from an interested motive on either supposition; and that the motive which the instinctive scheme holds up is the most selfish of the two. The other theory supposes, that the governing motive is the hope of future happiness and the dread of future misery; the instinctive scheme supplies a present motive in the self-complacency arising in the heart from consciousness of right conduct. The former is a rational motive, the latter has nothing more to do with reason than the enjoyment arising from eating or drinking, or from the intercourse between the sexes. But we mean not to pursue the subject farther, as we have said enough on it in the articles Benevolence, Instinct, Passion, and Philanthropy. We shall therefore conclude with observing, that there is certainly a virtuous as well as a vicious self-love, and that \"true self-love and social are the same.\"\n\nSELF-Murder. See Suicide.\n\nSELF-Partiality, is a phrase employed by some philosophers to express that weakness of human nature through which men overvalue themselves when compared with others. It is distinguished from general partiality, by those who make use of the expression, because it is thought that a man is led to overrate his own accomplishments, either by a particular instinct, or by a process of intellect different from that by which he overrates the accomplishments of his friends or children. The former kind of partiality is wholly selfish; the latter partakes much of benevolence.\n\nThis distinction may perhaps be deemed plausible by those who consider the human mind as little more than a bundle of instincts; but it must appear perfectly ridiculous to such as resolve the greater part of apparent instincts into early and deep-rooted associations of ideas. If the partialities which most men have to their friends, their families, and themselves, be instinctive, they are certainly instincts of different kinds; but an instinctive partiality is a contradiction in terms. Partiality is founded on a comparison between two or more objects; but genuine instincts form no comparisons. See Instinct.\n\nNo man can be said to be partial to the late Dr Johnson, merely for thinking highly of his intellectual powers; nor was the doctor partial to himself, though he thought in this respect with the generality of his countrymen; but if, upon a comparison with Milton, he was deemed the greater poet of the two, such a judgment will be allowed to be partial, whether formed by himself or by any of his admirers. We apprehend, however, that the process of its formation was the same in every mind by which it was held.\n\nThe origin of self-partiality is not difficult to be found; and our partialities to our friends may be traced to a similar source. By the constitution of our nature we are impelled to shun pain and to pursue pleasure; but remorse, the severest of all pains, is the never-failing consequence of vicious conduct. Remorse arises from the dread of that punishment which we believe will in a future state be inflicted on vice unrepened of in this; and therefore every vicious person endeavors by all possible means to banish that dread from his own mind. One way of effecting this is to compare his own life with the lives of others; for he fancies that if numbers be as wicked as himself, the benevolent Lord of all things will not involve them in one common ruin. Hence, by magnifying to himself the temptations which led him astray, and diminishing the injuries which his conduct has done in the world, and by adopting a course diametrically the reverse, when estimating\nthe morality or immorality of the conduct of his neighbours, he soon comes to believe that he is at least not more wicked than they. Thus is self-partiality formed in the mind, and quickly blinds him who is under its influence so completely, as to hide from him the very faults which he sees and blames in others. Hence the coward thinks himself only cautious, the miser frugal. Partiality is formed in the very same manner to natural or acquired accomplishments, whether mental or corporeal. These always procure respect to him who is possessed of them; and as respect is accompanied with many advantages, every man wishes to obtain it for himself. If he fail in his attempt, he consoles himself with the persuasion that it is at least due to his merits, and that it is only withheld by the envy of the public. He compares the particular branch of science or bodily accomplishment in which he himself most excels, with those which have conferred splendor on his rival; and easily finds that his own excellencies are of the highest order, and entitled to the greatest share of public esteem. Hence the polite scholar deifies the mathematician; the reader of Aristotle and Plato all the modern discoveries in physical and moral science; and the mere experimentalist holds in the most sovereign contempt a critical knowledge of the ancient languages. The pupil of the ancients denies the merits of the moderns, whilst the mere modern allows nothing to the ancients; and thus each becomes partial to his own acquisitions, and of course to himself, for having been at the trouble to make them.\n\nPartiality to our friends and families is generated in the very same way. Whenever we acquire such an affection for them as to consider their happiness as adding to our own (see PASSION), we magnify their excellencies, and diminish their defects, for the same reason, and by the same process, that we magnify and diminish our own. All partialities, however, are prejudices, and prejudices of the worst kind. They ought therefore to be guarded against with the utmost care, by the same means which we have elsewhere recommended (see PREJUDICE and METAPHYSICS, No. 98); and he who is partial to his own virtue or his own knowledge, will do well to compare the former, not with the conduct of his neighbour, but with the express rule of his duty; and to consider the latter as no farther valuable than it contributes to the sum of human happiness.\n\nSELIM I. emperor of the Turks, was the second son of Bajazet II. He made war upon his father, and though defeated in 1511, he at last dethroned him and took him prisoner, and immediately dispatched him by poison, together with his elder brother Achmet, and his younger Korkud, an amiable and enlightened prince. Having established his throne by these crimes, he marched against Campion-Guney sovereign of Egypt, gained a great victory at Aleppo, and slew their general. But though the sultan perished in that battle, the Mameluks determined to oppose the emperor. Selim entering their country at the head of his army, defeated the Egyptians in two battles, and ordered Toumombai, the new elected sultan, who had fallen into his hands, to be hung on a gibbet. He then took Cairo and Alexandria, and in a short time reduced all Egypt to subjection. Thus ended the dominion of the Mameluks in Egypt, which had continued for more than 260 years. He confirmed the ancient privileges of the Venetians in Egypt and Syria, by which they carried on their commerce with India, and formed a league with them to destroy the power of the Portuguese in that country. (See INDIA, No. 37.) Selim had before this gained a great victory over the Persians, and stripped them of Tauris and Keman. He was preparing to attack Christendom when he was seized with an ulcerous sore in the back. Thinking that the air of Adrianople would restore his health, he ordered himself to be conducted thither; but he died at Clari in Thrace on his road to that city, in the year 1520, in the very spot where he had poisoned his father. He reigned eight years, and lived 54. He was a prince of great courage, sobriety, and liberality; he was fond of history, and wrote some verses. But these good qualities were obscured by the most abominable crimes that ever disgraced human nature; he made his way to the throne by shedding the blood of his father, and secured it by murdering his brothers and eight nephews, and every bashaw who had been faithful to his duty.\n\nSELINUM, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, Umbellatae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nSELKIRK, ALEXANDER, whose adventures gave rise to a well-known historical romance, was born at Largo, in Fife-shire in Scotland, about the year 1676, and was bred a seaman. He went from England, in 1703, in the capacity of sailing-master of a small vessel called the Cinque-Ports Galley, Charles Pickering captain, burthen about 90 tons, with 16 guns and 63 men; and in September the same year sailed from Cork, in company with another ship of 26 guns and 120 men, called the St George, commanded by that famous navigator William Dampier, intended to cruise against the Spaniards in the South sea. On the coast of Brazil, Pickering died, and was succeeded in his command by his lieutenant Thomas Stradling. They proceeded on their voyage round Cape Horn to the island of Juan Fernandez, whence they were driven by the appearance of two French ships of 36 guns each, and left five of Stradling's men there on shore, who were taken off by the French. Hence they sailed to the coast of America, where Dampier and Stradling quarrelled, and separated by agreement, on the 19th of May 1704. In September following, Stradling came again to the island of Juan Fernandez, where Selkirk and his captain had a difference, which, with the circumstance of the ship's being very leaky, and in bad condition, induced him to determine on staying there alone; but when his companions were about to depart, his resolution was shaken, and he desired to be taken on board again. The captain, however, refused to admit him, and he was obliged to remain, having nothing but his clothes, bedding, a gun, and a small quantity of powder and ball; a hatchet, knife, and kettle; his books, and mathematical and nautical instruments. He kept up his spirits tolerably till he saw the vessel put off, when (as he afterwards related) his heart yearned within him, and melted at parting with his comrades and all human society at once.\n\n\"Yet believe me, Arcas,\nSuch is the rooted love we bear mankind,\"\nAll ruffians as they were, I never heard\nA sound so dismal as their parting oars.\"\n\nThus left sole monarch of the island, with plenty of\nthe necessaries of life, he found himself in a situation\nhardly supportable. He had fish, goat's flesh, turnips\nand other vegetables; yet he grew dejected, languid,\nand melancholy, to such a degree, as to be scarce able\nto refrain from doing violence to himself. Eighteen\nmonths passed before he could, by reasoning, reading\nhis bible, and study, he thoroughly reconciled to his\ncondition. At length he grew happy, employing him-\nself in decorating his huts, chafing the goats, whom he\nequalled in speed, and scarcely ever failed of catching.\nHe also tamed young kids, lambs them to prevent\ntheir becoming wild; and he kept a guard of tame cats\nabout him, to defend him when asleep from the rats,\nwho were very troublesome. When his clothes were\nworn out, he made others of goats skins, but could not\nsucceed in making shoes, with the use of which, how-\never, habit, in time, enabled him to dispense. His on-\nly liquor was water. He computed that he had caught\n1000 goats during his abode in the island; of which\nhe had let go 500, after marking them by clipping their\nears. Commodore Anon's people, who were there\nabout 30 years after, found the first goat which they\nshot upon landing, was thus marked, and as it appeared\nto be very old, concluded that it had been under the\npower of Selkirk. But it appears by Captain Carteret's\naccount of his voyage in the Swallow floop, that other\npersons practised this mode of marking, as he found a\ngoat with his ears thus slit on the neighbouring island\nof Mas-a-fuera, where Selkirk never was. He made\ncompanions of his tame goats and cats, often dancing\nand fingering with them. Though he constantly per-\nformed his devotions at stated hours, and read aloud;\nyet, when he was taken off the island, his language,\nfrom disuse of conversation, had become scarcely intelligible.\nIn this solitude he continued four years and\nfour months; during which time only two incidents\nhappened which he thought worth relating, the occurrences of every day being in his circumstances nearly similar.\nThe one was, that, pursuing a goat eagerly,\nhe caught it just on the edge of a precipice, which was\ncovered with bushes, so that he did not perceive it, and\nhe fell over to the bottom, where he lay (according to\nCaptain Roger's account) 24 hours senseless; but, as he\nrelated to Sir R. Steele, he computed, by the alteration\nof the moon, that he had lain three days. When he\ncame to himself, he found the goat lying under him dead.\nIt was with great difficulty that he could crawl to his\nhabitation, whence he was unable to stir for ten days,\nand did not recover of his bruises for a long time. The\nother event was the arrival of a ship, which he at first\nsupposed to be French: and such is the natural love of\nsociety in the human mind, that he was eager to aban-\ndon his solitary felicity, and surrender himself to them,\nalthough enemies; but upon their landing, approach-\ning them, he found them to be Spaniards, of whom he\nhad too great a dread to trust himself in their hands.\nThey were by this time so near that it required all his\nagility to escape, which he effected by climbing into a\nthick tree, being slain at several times as he ran off.\nFortunately the Spaniards did not discover him, though\nthey stayed some time under the tree where he was hid,\nand killed some goats just by. In this solitude Selkirk\nremained until the 2d of February 1709, when he saw\ntwo ships come into the bay, and knew them to be\nEnglish. He immediately lighted a fire as a signal;\nand on their coming on shore, found they were the Duke\nCaptain Rogers, and the Duke's Captain Cour-\nteney, two privateers from Bristol. He gave them the\nbest entertainment he could afford; and, as they had\nbeen a long time at sea without fresh provisions, the\ngoats which he caught were highly acceptable. His\nhabitation consisting of two huts, one to sleep in, the\nother to dress his food in, was so obscurely situated, and\nso difficult of access, that only one of the ship's officers\nwould accompany him to it. Dampier, who was pilot\non board the Duke, and knew Selkirk very well,\ntold Captain Rogers, that, when on board the Cinque-\nPorts, he was the best seaman in the vessel; upon\nwhich Captains Rogers appointed him master's mate\nof the Duke. After a fortnight's stay at Juan Fernandez,\nthe ships proceeded on their cruise against the Spa-\nniards; plundered a town on the coast of Peru; took a\nManilla ship off California; and returned by way of\nthe East Indies to England, where they arrived the 11th\nof October 1711; Selkirk having been absent eight\nyears, more than half of which time he had spent alone\nin the island. The public curiosity being excited respecting him, he was induced to put his papers into the\nhands of Defoe, to arrange and form them into a reg-\nular narrative. These papers must have been drawn\nup after he left Juan Fernandez, as he had no means of\nrecording his transactions there. Captain Cooke re-\nmarks, as an extraordinary circumstance, that he had\ncontrived to keep an account of the days of the week\nand month; but this might be done, as Defoe makes\nRobinson Crusoe do, by cutting notches in a pof, or\nmany other methods. From this account of Selkirk,\nDefoe took the idea of writing a more extensive work,\nthe romance of Robinson Crusoe, and very dishonestly\ndefrauded the original proprietor of his share of the\nprofits. Of the time or place or manner of this extra-\nordinary man's death we have received no account; but\nin 1798 the chief and musket which Selkirk had with\nhim on the island were in the possession of his grand-\nnephew, John Selkirk weaver in Largo.\n\nThe circumstances of Selkirk's seclusion from human\nsociety during his stay on Juan Fernandez, and the sen-\ntiments which that situation naturally inspired, have\nbeen so finely and characteristically depicted by Mr\nCowper, that many of our readers, we doubt not,\nwill be gratified if we give the verses alluded to a\nplace here.\n\nI am monarch of all I survey,\nMy right there is none to dispute;\nFrom the centre all round to the sea,\nI am lord of the fowl and the brute.\nOh, solitude! where are the charms\nThat fages have seen in thy face?\nBetter dwell in the midst of alarms,\nThan reign in this horrible place.\nI am out of humanity's reach,\nI must finish my journey alone,\nNever hear the sweet music of speech;\nI start at the sound of my own.\nThe beasts that roam over the plain,\nMy form with indifference see;\nThey are so unacquainted with man,\nTheir tameless is shocking to me.\nSociety, friendship, and love,\nDivinely beftow'd upon man,\nOh, had I the wings of a dove,\nHow soon would I taft you again!\nMy sorrows I then might affluage\nIn the ways of religion and truth,\nMight learn from the wisdom of age,\nAnd be cheer'd by the fallies of youth.\nReligion! what treasure untold!\nResides in that heavenly word!\nMore precious than silver and gold,\nOr all that this earth can afford.\nBut the found of the church-going bell\nThese valleys and rocks never heard,\nNor ever figh't at the found of a knell,\nOr smil'd when a Sabbath appear'd.\nYe winds that have made me your sport,\nConvey to this defolate thore\nSome cordial endearing report\nOf a land I shall visit no more.\nMy friends, do they now and then send\nA wish or a thought after me?\nO tell me I yet have a friend,\nThough a friend I am never to see.\nHow fleet is a glance of the mind!\nCompard with the speed of its flight,\nThe tempest itself lags behind,\nAnd the swift-winged arrows of light.\nWhen I think of my own native land,\nIn a moment I seem to be there;\nBut alas! recollection at hand\nSoon hurries me back to despair.\nBut the sea-fowl is gone to her nest,\nThe beast is laid down in his lair,\nEven here is a falcon of rest,\nAnd I to my cabin repair.\nThere's mercy in every place;\nAnd mercy, encouraging thought!\nGives even affliction a grace,\nAnd reconciles man to his lot.\n\nSelkirk, the capital of the county of the same name, is a small town pleasantly situated on a rising ground, and enjoys an extensive prospect in all directions, especially in the course of the river Ettrick. It is remarkable for those plaintive airs produced in its neighbourhood, the natural simplicity of which are the pride of Scotland and the admiration of strangers.\n\nThe citizens of this burgh, like the other inhabitants of the Sheriffdom of Ettrick Forest, rendered themselves famous by adhering to the fortune of their sovereign James IV. Of 100 citizens who followed that monarch to the plains of Flodden, a few returned loaded with spoils taken from the English. Of the trophies of that day, there yet remains in the possession of the corporation of weavers, a standard taken by a member of that body. It may also be mentioned, that the sword of William Boyd, the town-clerk, who led the citizens to the battle, and was knighted for his valour, still remains, it is said, in the possession of a citizen of Selkirk, his legal descendent. The desperate valour of the citizens, however, so exasperated the English, that they reduced their defences to ashes; but their grateful sovereign, James V., showed his sense of their services by a grant of an extensive track of Ettrick forest, the trees for building their houses, and the property as a reward for their heroism. Selkirk is a royal burgh, uniting with Lanark, Linlithgow and Peebles, in sending a member to parliament. W. Long, 2. 46. N. Lat. 55. 26.\n\nSELKIRK-SHIRE, called also the Sheriffdom of Ettrick Forest, a county of Scotland, extending about 20 miles in length from east to west, and about 12 in breadth from south to north. It borders on the north with part of Tweeddale and Mid-Lothian; on the south and east with Teviotdale; and on the west with Annandale. This county was formerly revered by the Scottish princes for the pleasure of the chase, and where they had houses for the reception of their train. At that time the face of the country was covered with woods, in which there were great numbers of red and fallow deer, whence it had the name of Ettrick Forest. The woods, however, are now almost entirely cut down, and the county is chiefly supported by the breed of sheep. They are generally fold into the south, but sometimes into the Highlands, about the month of March, where they are kept during summer; and after being improved by the mountain-grass, are returned into the Lowlands in the beginning of winter.\n\nThis county, though not very populous at present, was once the nurse of heroes, who were justly accounted the bulwark of their native soil, being ever ready to brave danger and death in its defence. Of this we have a memorable proof in the pathetic lamentations of their wives and daughters for the disaster of the field of Flodden, \"where their brave forefathers were a' wed away.\" The rivers Ettrick and Yarrow unite a little above the town of Selkirk, and terminate in the Tweed. For five miles above its junction with the Etterick, the Tweed is still adorned with woods, and leads the plesant imagination to contemplate what this country must have been in former times. The Yarrow, for about five miles above its junction with Ettrick, exhibits nature in a bold and striking aspect. Its native woods still remain, through which the stream has cut its turbid course, deeply engulfed amidst rugged rocks. Here, certainly in a flood, stood the descriptive Thomson when he saw it\n\n\"Work and boil, and foam and thunder through.\"\n\nOn a peninsula, cut out by the surrounding stream, in the middle of this fantastically wild scene of grandeur and beauty, stands the castle of Newark, which has been supposed by many to be the birthplace of Mary Scot the flower of Yarrow.\n\nThe population of this county in 1801 amounted to 5079, but the following is the population of the different parishes at two different periods, according to the Statistical History.\n\n| Parish | Population in 1755 | Population in 1790—1798 |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| Ettrick | 397               | 470                    |\n| Galaifiels | 998             | 914                    |\n| Carry forward | 1395            | 1384                   |\n\nSelkirk\nSELL, or SILL, in building, is of two kinds, viz.

The usual dose of this water is from half a pint to a pint; but in most cases it may be drunk freely. From its agreeable taste, and its exhilarating effects on the spirits, it is extensively employed at table as a common drink in Germany and Holland. In this country also, both the real and artificial Seltzer water is largely used for the same purpose. Seltzer water may be artificially imitated, by adding the ingredients diluted by analysis, and in the same proportion.\n\nSEM, or SHEM, the son of Noah, memorable for his filial piety in concealing the folly and disgrace of his father, for which he received a remarkable benediction, about 2476 B.C.

See Botany Index.\n\nWith respect to number, plants are either furnished with one seed, as sea-pink and bifton; two, as wood-roof and the umbelliferous plants; three, as spurge; four, as the lip-flowers of Tournefort and rough-leaved plants of Ray; or many, as ranunculus, anemone, and poppy.\n\nThe form of seeds is likewise extremely various, being either large or small, round, oval, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, angular, prickly, rough, hairy, wrinkled, sleek or shining, black, white, or brown. Most seeds have only one cell or internal cavity; those of lesser burdock, valerian, lamb's lettuce, cornelian, cherry, and sebette, have two.\n\nWith respect to sublimate, seeds are either soft, membranaceous, or of a hard bony sublimate; as in gromwell, tamarind, and all the nuciferous plants.\n\nIn point of magnitude, seeds are either very large, as in the cocoa-nut; or very small, as in campanula, ammanna, rampions, and throat-wort.\n\nWith respect to situation, they are either dispersed promiscuously through the pulp (femina nidulante), as in water-lily; affixed to a future or joining of the valves of the seed-vessel, as in the cross-shaped and pen-bloom flowers; or placed upon a placenta or receptacle within the seed vessel, as in tobacco and thorn-apple.\n\nSeeds are said to be naked (femina nuda) which are not contained in a cover or vellet; such as those of the lip and compound flowers, the umbelliferous and rough-leaved plants. Covered seeds (femina tecla) are contained in some vessel, whether of the capsule, pod, berry, apple, or cherry kind.\n\nA simple seed is such as bears neither crown, wing, nor downy pappus; the varieties in seeds, arising from these circumstances, are particularly enumerated under their respective heads.\n\nIn assimilating the animal and vegetable kingdoms, Linnaeus denominates seeds the eggs of plants. The fecundity of plants is frequently marvellous; from a single plant or stalk of Indian Turkey wheat, are produced, in one summer, 2000 seeds; of eleocharis, 3000; of sunflower, 4000; of poppy, 32,000; of a spike of cat's tail, 10,000 and upwards; a single fruit, or seed-vessel, of tobacco, contains 1000 seeds; that of white poppy, 8000. Mr Ray relates, from experiments made by himself, that 1012 tobacco seeds are equal in weight to one grain; and that the weight of the whole quantum of seeds in a single tobacco plant, is such as must, according to the above proportion, determine their number to be 360,000. The same author estimates the annual produce of a single stalk of spleenwort to be upwards of one million of seeds.\n\nThe dissemination of plants respects the different methods or vehicles by which nature has contrived to diffuse their seeds for the purpose of increase. These by naturalists are generally reckoned four.\n\n1. Rivers and running waters. 2. The wind. 3. Animals. 4. An elastic spring, peculiar to the seeds themselves.\n\n1. The seeds which are carried along by rivers and torrents are frequently conveyed many hundreds of leagues from their native soil, and cast upon a very different climate, to which, however, by degrees they render themselves familiar.\n\n2. Those which are carried by the wind, are either winged, as in fir-tree, trumpet-flower, tulip-tree, birch, arbor-vitae, meadow rue, and jessamine, and some umbelliferous plants; furnished with a pappus, or downy crown, as in valerian, poplar, reed, succulent-sallow-wort, cotton tree, and many of the compound flowers; placed\nplaced within a winged calyx or seed-vessel, as in sycamore, sea-pink, dock, dioscorea, ash, maple, and elm-trees, logwood and woad; or lastly, contained within a swelled calyx or seed vessel, as in winter cherry, cucumbers, melilot, bladder-nut, fumitory, bladder-fennel, heart-seed, and chick-pea.\n\n3. Many birds swallow the seeds of vanelloe, juniper, milletoe, oats, millet, and other grasses, and void them entire. Squirrels, rats, parrots, and other animals, suffer many of the seeds which they devour to escape, and thus in effect disseminate them. Moles, ants, earthworms, and other insects, by ploughing up the earth, admit a free passage to those seeds which have been scattered upon its surface. Again, some seeds attach themselves to animals, by means of crotchetts, hooks, or hairs, which are either affixed to the seeds themselves, as in hound's tongue, mouse-ear, vervain, carrot, bastard-parley, fanicle, water hemp-agrimony, arctopus and verbena; to their calyx, as in burdock, agrimony, rhoxia, small wild bugloss, dock, nettle, pellitory, and feed-wort; or to their fruit or seed-vessel, as in liquorice, enchanted's nightshade, crocus-wort, cleavers, French honey-fuckle, and arrow-headed grass.\n\n4. The seeds which disperse themselves by an elastic force, have that force resident either in their calyx, as in oats, and the greater number of ferns; in their poppy, as in centaurea erupina; or in their capsule, as in geranium, herb-bennet, African spirea, fraxinella, horsetail, balsam, Malabar nut, cucumber, elaterium, and male balsam apple.\n\nSEmen, in the animal economy.

They were celebrated in the temple of Tellus, where solemn sacrifices were offered to Tellus and Ceres. These feasts were held about seed-time, usually in the month of January; for, as Macrobius observes, they were moveable feasts.\n\nSEMI, a word borrowed from the Latin, signifying half; but only used in composition with other words, as in the following articles.\n\nSEMI-Arians, in ecclesiastical history, a branch of the ancient Arians, constituting, according to Epiphanius, of such as, in appearance, condemned the errors of that heresiarch, but yet acquiesced in some of the principles thereof, only palliating and hiding them under softer and more moderate terms. Though they separated from the Arian faction (see Arians), they could never be brought to acknowledge that the Son was homoousios, that is, consubstantial, or of the same substance with the Father; they would only allow him to be homousious, that is, of a like substance with the Father, or similar to the Father in his essence, not by nature, but by a peculiar privilege.\n\nThe semiarianism of the moderns consists in their maintaining that the Son was from all eternity begotten by the will of the Father, contrary to the doctrine of the orthodox, who seem to teach that the eternal generation is necessary. Such at least are the respective opinions of Dr Clarke and Bishop Bull. See Theology.\n\nSEMICIRCLE, in Geometry, half a circle, or that figure comprehended between the diameter of the circle and half its circumference.\n\nSEMICOLON, in Grammar, one of the points or stops used to distinguish the several members of a sentence from each other.\n\nThe mark or character of the semicolon is (;), and has its name as being of somewhat less effect than a colon; or as demanding a shorter pause.\n\nThe proper use of the semicolon is to distinguish the conjunct members of a sentence. Now, by a conjunct member of a sentence is meant such a one as contains at least two simple members.—Whenever, then, a sentence can be divided into several members of the same degree, which are again divisible into other simple members, the former are to be separated by a semicolon.\n\nFor instance: \"If fortune bear a great way over him, who has nicely stated and concerted every circumstance of an affair; we must not commit everything without reserve, to fortune, lest she have too great a hold of us.\"\n\nAgain: Si quantum in agro locisque defertis audacia potest, tantum in foro atque judicis impudentia valeret; non minus in causa cederet Aulus Caccinna Sexta Æbutil impudentiae, quam tam in vi facienda celsit audacia. An instance in a more complex sentence we have in Cicero: Res familiaris primum bene parte fit, nulloque turpi quaestu: tum quam plurimis, modo dignis, se utilem praebat; deinde augentur ratione, diligentia, parsimonia; nec libidoi potius luxuriaque, quam liberalitati et beneficentiae pareat.\n\nBut though the proper use of the semicolon be to distinguish conjunct members, it is not necessary that all the members thus divided be conjunct. For upon dividing a sentence into great and equal parts, if one of them be conjunct, all those other parts of the same degree are to be distinguished by a semicolon.—Sometimes also it happens, that members that are opposite to each other, but relate to the same verb, are separated by a semicolon. Thus Cicero: Ex hac parte pudor, illinc petulantia; hinc fides, illinc fraudatio; hinc pietas, illinc jejunia, &c. To this likewise may be referred such sentences, where the whole going before, the parts follow: as \"The parts of oratory are four; invention, disposition, elocution, and pronunciation.\"\n\nSEMICUBITUM, in Medicine, an half-bath, wherein the patient is only placed up to the navel.\n\nSEMI-DIAMETER, half the diameter, or a right line drawn from the centre of a circle or sphere to its circumference: being the same with what is otherwise called the radius.\n\nSEMI-FLOSCULUS, in Botany, a term used to express the flowers of the syngenesia clasps.

Of these there are great numbers; it being ordained by the council of Trent, that there be a seminary belonging to each cathedral, under the direction of the bishop.\n\nSEMINATION denotes the manner or act of shedding and dispersing the seeds of plants. See SEMEN.\n\nSEMIPELAGIANS, in Ecclesiastical History, a name given to such as retain some tincture of Pelagianism. See PELAGIANS.\n\nThe doctrines of this sect, as well as those of their predecessors the Pelagians, have their common source in Pelagius, a native of Britain, of whom we have already taken notice. He is said to have been but a simple monk, and not in orders. Having gone to Rome about the end of the fourth century, he lived there for some years with reputation, and was considered both pious and virtuous. Rufinus a priest of Aquileia, having come to Rome in the year 397, is affirmed by some to have been the person who suggested to Pelagius his peculiar doctrines.\n\nIn the year 400 Pelagius began to teach his opinions at Rome, both by speech and writing. He was not the only person who taught these doctrines, of which we have elsewhere enumerated the heads. His friend and companion Celestius, an able man than himself, maintained them likewise, and with much more address and subtlety. After having promulgated them in Rome, they went into Sicily, where they lived for some time. Thence, in the year 411, they passed over into Africa. Pelagius soon after went into Palestine, whilst Celestius remained at Carthage, and was preparing himself to take the order of priesthood; but it being soon discovered that he taught a new doctrine*, he was accused by the deacon Paulinus in a synod held at Carthage in 412, at which Aurelius the bishop presided. Celestius, on being charged by Paulinus with denying original sin, made answer, \"That in truth he doubted whether the sin of Adam was transmitted to his posterity.\" He did not however own that children had no need of baptism, although this was one of the Pelagian tenets; on the contrary, he wrote a little discourse, in which he acknowledged, that children had need of redemption, and that they could not obtain it without baptism. The bishops at the council of Carthage condemned the doctrines of Celestius, and excommunicated him. From this sentence he appealed to the bishop of Rome; but he neglected to pursue his appeal, and went to Ephesus, where he endeavoured to get himself ordained priest. In the mean time, Pelagius having retired into Palestine, was kindly received by St Jerome's enemy, John of Jerusalem. With him he entered into an engagement to attack the reputation of that author. St Jerome defended himself from their assault, and attacked the doctrines of Pelagius†, and in this undertaking he was soon assisted by St Augustine. About this time, Orosius having gone from Spain into Africa and thence into Palestine, published there the proceedings against Celestius at Carthage, and was prevailed upon by the bishop of Jerusalem to enter into a conference with Pelagius in his presence; but the bishop having shown too much partiality for Pelagius, Orosius would not acknowledge him for judge, but demanded that the decision of that affair, Semipelagians, which was among the Latins, might be referred to judges who understood the language. This happened in the year 415, at which time there were in Palestine two French prelates, who, being driven from their dioceses, fled into that country, and having been apprized of the opinions of Pelagius and Celestius, drew up an abridgement from their own books of the errors imputed to them‡. To this they joined the articles condemned at St Augustine's synod of Carthage, and some others, which were sent from Sicily by Hilarius to St Augustine, and then presented the abridgement to the bishop of Caesarea, against the Pelagians. The matter was referred to a council of 14 bishops, at Pelagius, which, when the memoir was read, Pelagius explained himself upon some articles, and denied that he was the author of others. He also disowned the propositions condemned at Carthage, and some others ascribed to Celestius. He did not even hesitate to condemn them; upon which the bishops decided, that, since Pelagius approved the doctrine of the church, and rejected and condemned what was contrary to its belief, they acknowledged him to be of the ecclesiastical and catholic communion.\n\nOrosius returning to Africa, took with him the memoir against Pelagius, and presented it to a meeting of bishops* held at Carthage in 416. Having read over what had been done at a former meeting against Celestius of St Augustine, they declared, that both he and Pelagius ought to be anathematized if they did not publicly renounce and condemn the errors imputed to them. The bishops of this meeting, and those of Numidia assembled the same year at Milvium, wrote upon the subject to Pope Innocent, who approved of the judgement of the African prelates, and declared Pelagius, Celestius, and their followers excommunicated†. Innocent gave an account of this judgement to the bishops of the East, and the matter seemed altogether at an end, when he died; but Celestius having been made priest at Ephesus, and having gone to Constantinople, whence he was driven by Atticus bishop of that city, who also wrote against him to Asia and to Africa, he came to Rome in the beginning of the pontificate of Zozimus, and undertook to pursue the appeal, which he had formerly made from the judgement of the synod of Carthage. Having cited his accuser Paulinus, and offered to justify himself, he presented a Confession of Faith, in which he acknowledged that children ought to be baptized, in order to inherit the kingdom of heaven; but he denied that the sin of Adam was transmitted to his children. He appeared before the bishops and clergymen assembled by the pope, and declared, that he condemned all the errors with which he had been charged. The pope delayed his judgement for two months, and in the mean time received a letter and a confession of faith from Pelagius, very artfully drawn up. When the time for judgement arrived, Zozimus held a synod, and said, that he thought the declarations of Pelagius and Celestius sufficient for their justification. He was displeased at the two French bishops for not appearing against them, and wrote two letters on that head, one to the bishops of Africa, and another in particular to Aurelius, bishop of Carthage. The African bishops, to the number of 214, without regarding the judgement passed at Rome, assembled at Carthage, and, having confirmed their former decisions, condemned the doctrines of the Pelagians. They wrote\nto the bishop of Rome to acquaint him, that he had been deceived by Celestius, and discovered to him the equivocations of his letter and of the Confession of Faith of Pelagius, sending him a memoir of the errors of which he should require a distinct and precise revocation from the two heretics. The pope made answer, that, although his authority was so great, that none durst differ from his judgement, still that he was willing to communicate the matter to them, and would let it remain in the same state, until a new deliberation could take place. This letter was presented to a council held at Carthage in 418, at which eight canons were drawn up against the Pelagian heresy. The bishop of Rome, in the mean time, was inclined to examine again the affair of Celestius, and to endeavour to draw from him distinct and precise answers according to the plan suggested by the African bishops in their memoir; but Celestius would not come forward, and accordingly withdrew from Rome. From his flight the pope concluded, that he imposed upon him formerly, and that he held the new doctrines; and, accordingly, changing his opinion with respect to him, he approved of the decrees of the African prelates, and renewed the condemnations of his predecessor, Pope Innocent, against him and Pelagius. This judgement he published in a letter which was sent to all the bishops. About the same time an edict was published by the emperor Honorius against Pelagius and Celestius, ordering, that they should be banished from Rome, and that all their followers should be sent into exile.\n\nIn the following year Honorius published another edict, by which it was ordered, that the bishops who would not sign the pope's letter, should be deprived of their churches. Accordingly, Julian the bishop of Eclanum, who was afterwards head of the party, and seventeen other bishops, were cashiered; upon which they wrote a letter to Rufus, bishop of Thessalonica, and demanded a universal council from the emperor, which he refused. Celestius returned again to Rome, but was again expelled the city; whilst his followers, being expelled from Italy, retired to different countries. Some of them came over into Britain, and others went into the East. Attilius banished them from Constantinople, and they were also banished from Ephesus. Theodotus, bishop of Antioch, condemned them in a synod held at Dioctolis, and banished Pelagius and his followers out of Palestine, whither they had returned. Julian the bishop was condemned in a provincial synod of Cilicia, whither he had retired to Theodorus bishop of Mopfuetta, who was obliged to anathematize him. What became of Pelagius is unknown, as history gives no farther account of him; but Celestius having returned to Rome, and being driven thence by Pope Celestin, went with Julian and some other bishops of their party to Constantinople, where they endeavoured to prevail upon the emperor Theodosius to assemble a council, instead of which he ordered them to leave the city. After this they joined with the Nestorians, and were condemned together with them in a general council held at Ephesus in 431; and there now remained but a small number of Pelagians dispersed in the West. Julian after having endeavoured several times to get himself reinstated in his bishopric, was at last obliged to retire into Sicily, where he died.\n\nTo the Pelagians succeeded the Semipelagians, who rejected the doctrines of the former with respect to original sin and the power of free will to do good. They owned, that man had need of the grace of God to persevere in well-doing; but they believed, that the beginning of good will and faith did not necessarily depend upon grace; for that man, by the mere force of nature, might desire to do good, and that God seconded that good will by his affluence, which depended upon liberty, and was given to all men. Besides these, they maintained some other peculiar tenets. The origin of some of their opinions is founded in this, that some of the books which were written by St Augustine in his last years, with respect to the controversies which arose in the monastery of Adrumetum, relative to correction, grace, and predestination, having been carried into Gaul, happened to give offence to several persons, and particularly to the monks of Lerins, who considered his doctrines hostile to that of free will. This led them to think and maintain, that, in order to be saved, it was necessary to leave to man the power of knowing and desiring good by the force of nature, so that the beginning might come from man. Several considerable persons in Gaul, and even some bishops, but particularly the priests, were of this opinion. Cassian, deacon of Constantinople, and afterwards priest at Marseille, authorized it in his conferences, and Faustus, bishop of Riez, supported it very strenuously. St Augustine stood up to oppose this doctrine from its very first appearance, and was supported by Prosper and Hilarius. Pope Celestin complained to the bishops of Gaul, that they suffered their priests to speak ill of the doctrines of St Augustine; and Popes Gelasius and Hormisdas condemned the books of Faustus; and last of all, the council of Orange, held in 529, condemned particularly the principal tenets of the Semipelagians, and put an end at that time to the controversy, about 100 years after the death of St Augustine.—See the histories of Mosheim, Dupin and Fleury, &c. &c.\n\nThe Semipelagians were very numerous; and their doctrines, though variously explained, were received in many of the monastic schools in Gaul, whence they spread themselves far and wide through Europe. With respect to the Greeks and other Christians of the East, we may remark, that they had adopted the Semipelagian tenets, even before they were promulgated in Gaul by Cassian and Faustus.\n\nAfter the period, however, at which the Semipelagian doctrines were condemned in the council of Orange, we find but little notice taken of this sect by historians. Although its tenets were maintained by a few in the succeeding centuries, the sect could boast of no eminent leaders, and sunk into obscurity. In the beginning, indeed, of the reformation, some of the Pelagian tenets were again brought into circulation. Every one is acquainted with the hostility of Luther to the doctrine of free will, who went so far into the opposite extreme as to entitle one of his works against the celebrated Erasmus on this subject, \"De Servo Arbitrio.\" But notwithstanding that Luther was their leader, this doctrine of his was not adopted by some of the most eminent of the reformers. His learned friend, the mild and worthy Melanchthon, although he at first (either from not having sufficiently considered the subject, or because this doctrine was so unpalatable to the great body of the reformers on account of the authority of Luther), joined\nwith Luther in his hostility to the doctrine of free will, so far as to say, that free will could have no effect, under the influence of grace, shortly after changed his opinion so as to run into the opposite extreme. For although Luther at his outset had affirmed, that the pre-eminence of God annihilated free will in all his creatures, he was softened down into moderation at the time of the drawing up of the famous Confession of Augsburg, as to allow Melanchthon, who composed it, to insert these words, \"that it was necessary to allow free-will to all who possessed the use of reason, not however in such things as regarded God, which they could not commence, or at least which they could not complete, without his assistance and grace, but in the affairs, or works, of the present life solely, and in order to perform their duty towards society.\" In this passage two truths are clearly admitted: 1. That there is free-will in man; and 2. That of itself it has no efficacy in such works as are purely Christian or religious. But although this be evident, and although it would seem as if he attributed the efficacy of religious works solely to the grace of God, yet the restricting words \"at least,\" show, that he was of opinion, that free-will, by its own natural force and efficacy, though it could not complete, could at least commence, Christian or religious works, without the assistance of grace. To such of our readers as are acquainted with ecclesiastical history, it is unnecessary to remark, that this was one of the leading tenets of the Semipelagians. But Melanchthon did not stop here. It is true, that, in order to keep well with the reformers, he was obliged, in those public instruments which he drew up, to infirm rather than avow his partiality for the doctrine of free-will, the exercise of which, we see, he confined in the Confession of Augsburg, to such actions merely as regarded civil life and our duties to society. In the Saxon Confession of Faith, however, he proceeds a step farther, and says \"that the will is free; that God neither wishes for, nor approves, nor co-operates in the production of sin; but that the free-will of man and of the devils is the true cause of their sin and of their fall.\" Many no doubt will be of opinion, that Melanchthon merits praise for having thus corrected Luther, and for having more clearly expressed his own opinion, than he had done in the Confession of Augsburg. He even proceeds farther, and extends the exercise of free-will to religious or Christian works. For after having explained in the Saxon Confession of Faith the nature of free-will, and the manner in which it makes a choice, and having also shown, that it is not of itself sufficient in those works, or actions, which regard a future life, he affirms twice \"that the will, even after having received the influence of the Holy Spirit, does not remain idle,\" that is to say, it is not merely passive under the influence of grace, but can reject it, or co-operate with it, at pleasure. Necessity, it is true, obliged him to express his opinion rather obscurely. But what he intimates only in these last quoted words, is clearly and fully expressed in one of his letters to Calvin. \"I had, says he, a friend who, in reasoning upon predestination, believed equally the two following things; namely, that every thing happens amongst men as it is ordained by Providence, but that there is, nevertheless, a contingency in actions or in events. He confessed, however, that he was unable to reconcile these two things. For my part, (continues Melanchthon), who am of opinion, that God neither wishes for, nor is the cause of sin, I acknowledge this contingency in the feebleness of our judgement, in order that the ignorant may confess, that David fell of himself, and voluntarily, into sin; that he had it in his power to preserve the grace of the Holy Spirit which he had within him, and that in this combat, or trial, it is necessary to acknowledge some exercise or action of the will.\"\n\nThis opinion he confirms and illustrates by a passage from St Basil, where he says, \"Have but the will, or the inclination, and God is with you.\" By which words Melanchthon seems to intimate, that the will is not only active in the works of religion, but even begins them without grace. This, however, was not the meaning of St Basil, as is evident from several other parts of his writings; but that it was the opinion of Melanchthon appears fully from this passage, as well as from that which we have cited from the Confession of Augsburg, in which he intimates, that the error is not in saying, that the will can of itself commence, but in thinking, that it can without grace finish or complete, religious or Christian works. Thus it appears, that he considered the will capable of rejecting the influence of grace, since he declares, that David could preserve the Holy Spirit when he lost it, as well as he could lose it when he kept it within him. But although this was his decided opinion, he durst not avow it fully in the Saxon Confession of Faith, but was obliged to content himself with intimating it gently in these words, \"The will, even after receiving the grace of the Holy Spirit, is not idle or without action.\" All this precaution, however, was insufficient to save Melanchthon from censure. Francowitz, better known by the name of Illyricus, being jealous of him and his enemy, by his influence with his party procured the condemnation of these words of the Saxon Confession, and of the passage from St Basil, at two synods held by the Reformers; at the same time, that one party of the Lutherans were unwilling to adopt Melanchthon's opinion, \"that the will is not passive, when under the influence of grace,\" we are at a loss to think how they could deny it, since they almost unanimously confess, that a person under the influence of grace may reject and lose it. This opinion is avowed in the Confession of Augsburg, and in Melanchthon's Apology. It was even, long after that, decided upon anew, inculcated strongly in their book of Concord, and was brought frequently against them by their opponents as a proof of inconsistency and contradiction.\n\nThese are not the only instances in which the Lutherans were charged with Semipelagian principles. One of the ablest and the most learned of their opponents, we cannot help thinking, had in more than one instance made good the charge against them. To prove this we need only refer to the remarks that have been made on the eight celebrated propositions in the third book of Concord, relative to the cooperation of the will with grace. According to the first seven of these propositions, an attentive listening to the preaching of the word of God produceth grace; and according to the fifth, any man, even a libertine or an infidel, is free, or has it in his power to listen attentively to the preaching of the word of God. He has it then in his power to give to himself that which to him is productive of grace, and may thus be the sole author of his own conversion.\nSemipelagians or regeneration. In the eighth proposition it is affirmed, that we are not permitted to doubt, but that the grace of the Holy Spirit, even though it may not be felt, does accompany an attentive hearing of the word of God; and to do away every doubt about the species of attention which they mean, we must observe, that they speak of attention in as much as it precedes the grace of the Holy Spirit, and of that attention which, in consequence of its dependence on free-will, we have it in our power to bestow upon the word or not, just as we please. It is the exercise of this free attention which they say operates grace. But here it would seem, that they were in extremes; for, as they said upon one hand, that, when the Holy Spirit begins to move us, we act not at all; so they maintained on the other, that this operation of the Holy Spirit, which converts us without any co-operation on our part, is necessarily attendant upon an act of our wills, in which the Holy Spirit has no share, and in which our liberty acts purely by its natural force or power. Such of our readers as are anxious to examine the progress of the Pelagian and Semipelagian principles after the dawn of the Reformation, we must refer to the works of the principal reformers and to those of their adversaries, as well as to the different writers upon ecclesiastical history.\n\nSEMIRAMIS, in fabulous history, a celebrated queen of Assyria, daughter of the goddess Derceto, by a young Assyrian. She was exposed in a desert; but her life was preserved by doves for one whole year, till Simmas, one of the shepherds of Ninus, found her and brought her up as his own child. Semiramis, when grown up, married Menones, the governor of Nineveh, and accompanied him to the siege of Bactria; where, by her advice and prudent directions, she hastened the king's operations, and took the city. These eminent services, together with her uncommon beauty, endeared her to Ninus. The monarch asked her of her husband, and offered him his daughter Sofana in her stead; but Menones, who tenderly loved Semiramis, refused; and when Ninus had added threats to entreaties, he hanged himself. No sooner was Menones dead, than Semiramis, who was of an aspiring soul, married Ninus, by whom she had a son called Ninosar. Ninus was so fond of Semiramis, that at her request he resigned the crown, and commanded her to be proclaimed queen and sole empress of Assyria. Of this, however, he had cause to repent: Semiramis put him to death, the better to establish herself on the throne; and when she had no enemies to fear at home, she began to repair the capital of her empire, and by her means Babylon became the most superb and magnificent city in the world. She visited every part of her dominions, and left everywhere immortal monuments of her greatness and benevolence. To render the roads passable and communication easy, she hollowed mountains and filled up valleys, and water was conveyed at a great expense by large and convenient aqueducts to barren deserts and unfruitful plains. She was not less distinguished as a warrior: Many of the neighbouring nations were conquered; and when Semiramis was once told as she was dressing her hair, that Babylon had revolted, she left her toilette with precipitation, and though only half dressed, she refused to have the rest of her head adorned before the sedition was quelled and tranquillity re-established. Semiramis has been accused of licentiousness; and some authors have observed that she regularly called the strongest and stoutest men in her army to her arms, and afterwards put them to death, that they might not be living witnesses of her incontinence. Her passion for her son was also unnatural; and it was this criminal propensity which induced Ninyas to destroy his mother with his own hands. Some say that Semiramis was changed into a dove after death, and received immortal honours in Assyria. It is supposed that she lived about 11 centuries before the Christian era, and that she died in the 62nd year of her age and the 25th of her reign. Many fabulous reports have been propagated about Semiramis, and some have declared that for some time she disguised herself and passed for her son Ninyas.

See Botany Index.\n\nSENNAAR, or SENNAAR. See SENNAAR.\n\nSENATE, in general, is an assembly or council of senators; that is, of the principal inhabitants of a state, who have a share in the government.\n\nThe senate of ancient Rome is of all others the most celebrated. It exercised no contentious jurisdiction; but appointed judges, either from among the senators or knights, to determine causes; it also appointed governors of provinces, and disposed of the revenues of the commonwealth, &c. Yet did not the whole sovereign power reside in the senate, since it could not elect magistrates, make laws, or decide of war and peace; in all which cases the senate was obliged to consult the people.\n\nThe senate, when first instituted by Romulus, consisted of 100 members; to whom he afterwards added the same number when the Sabines had migrated to Rome. Tarquin the ancient made the senate consist of 300, and this number remained fixed for a long time; but afterwards it fluctuated greatly, and was increased first to 700, and afterwards to 900 by Julius Caesar, who filled the senate with men of every rank and order. Under Augustus the senators amounted to 1000, but this number was reduced, and fixed to 600. The place of a senator was always bestowed upon merit: the monarchs had the privilege of choosing the members; and after the expulsion of the Tarquins, it was one of the rights of the consuls, till the election of the censors, who from their office seemed most capable of making choice of men whose character was irreproachable, whose morals were pure, and relations honourable. Only particular families were admitted into the senate; and when the plebeians were permitted to share the honours of the state, it was then required that they should be born of free citizens. It was also required that the candidates should be knights before their admission into the senate. They were to be above the age of 25, and to have previously passed through the inferior offices of quaestor, tribune of the people, edile, pretor, and consul.\n\nThe senate always met of course on the 1st of January, for the inauguration of the new consuls; and in all months, universally, there were three days, viz. the kalends, nones, and ides, on which it regularly met: but it always met on extraordinary occasions, when called together by consul, tribune, or dictator.\n\nTo render their decrees valid and authentic, a certain number of members was requisite, and such as\nwere absent without some proper cause were always fined. In the reign of Augustus, 400 senators were requisite to make a senate. Nothing was transacted before sunrise or after sunset. In their office the senators were the guardians of religion, they disposed of the provinces as they pleased, they prorogued the assemblies of the people; they appointed thanksgivings, nominated their ambassadors, distributed the public money, and in short had the management of every thing political or civil in the republic, except the creating of magistrates, the enacting of laws, and the declaration of war or peace, which were confined to the assemblies of the people.\n\nSENATOR, in general, denotes a member of some senate.\n\nThe dignity of a Roman senator could not be supported without the possession of 80,000 sesterces, or about 7000l. English money; and therefore such as squandered away their money, and whose fortune was reduced below this sum, were generally struck out of the list of senators. This regulation was not made in the first ages of the republic, when the Romans boasted of their poverty. The senators were not permitted to be of any trade or profession. They were distinguished from the rest of the people by their dress; they wore the tunic, half-boots of a black colour, with a crescent or silver buckle in the form of a C; but this last honour was confined only to the descendants of those hundred senators who had been elected by Romulus, as the letter C seems to imply. See the preceding article.\n\nAmong us, senator is a member of parliament. In the laws of King Edward the Confessor, we are told that the Britons called those senators whom the Saxons called afterwards aldermen and borough-masters; though not for their age, but their wisdom; for some of them were young men, but very well skilled in the laws. Kenilworth king of the Mercians granted a charter, which ran thus, viz. Confilio et confensi episcoporum et senato rum gentis juxta largitum fuit disto monasterio, &c.\n\nIn Scotland, the lords of session are called senators of the college of justice.\n\nSENATUS AUCTORITAS. See the next article.\n\nSENATUS CONSULTUM, which made part of the Roman law. When any public matter was introduced into the senate, which was always called referre ad senatum, any senator whose opinion was asked, was permitted to speak upon it as long as he pleased, and on that account it was often usual for the senators to protract their speeches till it was too late to determine. When the question was put, they passed to the side of that speaker whose opinion they approved, and a majority of votes was easily collected, without the trouble of counting the numbers. When the majority was known, the matter was determined, and a senatus consultum was immediately written by the clerks of the house, at the feet of the chief magistrates, and it was signed by all the principal members of the house. When there was not a sufficient number of members to make a senate, the decision was called senatus auctoritas, but it was of no force if it did not afterwards pass into a senatus consultum.\n\nThe senatus consultum were at first left in the custody of the kings, and afterward of the consuls, who could apprize or preserve them; but about the year of Rome 304, they were always deposited in the temple of Ceres, and afterwards in the treasury, by the ediles of the people.\n\nSENECA, Lucius Annaeus, a Stoic philosopher, was born at Corduba in Spain, about the beginning of the Christian era, of an equestrian family, which had probably been transplanted thither in a colony from Rome. He was the second son of Marcus Annaeus Seneca, commonly called the rhetorician, whose remains are printed under the title of Sagittariae et Controversiae, cum Declamationum Excerptis; and his youngest brother Annæus Mela (for there were three of them) had the honour of being father to the poet Lucan. He was removed to Rome, together with his father and the rest of his family, while he was yet in his infancy. There he was educated in the most liberal manner, and under the best masters. He learned eloquence from his father; but his genius rather leading him to philosophy, he put himself under the floes Attalus, Sotion, and Papirius Fabianus; men famous in their way, and of whom he has made honourable mention in his writings. It is probable, too, that he travelled when he was young, since we find him, in several parts of his works, particularly in his Questiones Naturales, making very exact and curious observations upon Egypt and the Nile.—But this, though entirely agreeable to his own humour, did not at all correspond with that scheme or plan of life which his father had drawn out for him; who, therefore, forced him to the bar, and put him upon soliciting for public employments; so that he afterwards became quaestor, praetor, and, as Livy says will have it, even consul.\n\nIn the first year of the reign of Claudius, when Julia the daughter of Germanicus was accused of adultery by Messalina, and banished, Seneca was banished too, being charged as one of the adulterers. Corsica was the seat of his exile, where he lived eight years; \"happy in the midst of those things which usually make other people miserable;\" inter eas res beatas, quae solent miseros facere: and here he wrote his books of consolation, addressed to his mother Helvia, and to his friend Polybius, and perhaps some of those tragedies which go under his name; for he says, modo se levioribus studiis ibi obletatur. Agrippina being married to Claudius, upon the death of Messalina, she prevailed with the emperor to recall Seneca from banishment; and afterwards procured him to be tutor to her son Nero, whom she designed for the empire. Afranius Burrhus, a praetorian prefect, was joined with him in this important charge: and these two preceptors, who were entrusted with equal authority, had each his respective department. By the bounty and generosity of his royal pupil, Seneca acquired that prodigious wealth which rendered him in a manner equal to kings. His houses and walks were the most magnificent in Rome. His villas were innumerable: and he had immense sums of money placed out at interest in almost every part of the world. The historian Dio reports him to have had 250,000l. sterling at interest in Britain alone; and reckons his calling it in all at a sum, as one of the causes of a war with that nation.\n\nAll this wealth, however, together with the luxury and effeminacy of a court, does not appear to have had any ill effect upon the temper and disposition of Seneca. He continued abstemious, exact in his manners, and\nSeneca, and, above all, free from the vices so commonly prevalent in such places, flattery and ambition. \"I had rather (said he to Nero) offend you by speaking the truth, than please you by lying and flattery: maluerim verum effendi, quam placere adulando.\" How well he acquitted himself in quality of preceptor to his prince, may be known from the five first years of Nero's reign, which have always been considered as a perfect pattern of good government; and if that emperor had but been observant of his master through the whole course of it, as he was at the beginning, he would have been the delight, and not, as he afterwards proved, the curse and detestation of mankind. But when Poppaea and Tigellinus had got the command of his humour, and hurried him into the most extravagant and abominable vices, he soon grew weary of his master, whose life must indeed have been a constant rebuke to him. Seneca, perceiving that his favour declined at court, and that he had many accusers about the prince, who were perpetually whispering in his ear the great riches of Seneca, his magnificent houses and fine gardens, and what a favourite through means of these he was grown with the people, made an offer of them all to Nero. Nero refused to accept them: which, however, did not hinder Seneca from changing his way of life; for, as Tacitus relates, he \"kept no more levees, declined the usual civilities which had been paid to him, and, under a pretence of indisposition, or some engagement or other, avoided as much as possible appearing in public.\"\n\nNero, in the meantime, who, as it is supposed, had dispatched Burrhus by poison, could not be easy till he had rid himself of Seneca also: For Burrhus was the manager of his military concerns, and Seneca conducted his civil affairs. Accordingly, he attempted, by means of Cleonius, a freedman of Seneca, to take him off by poison; but this not succeeding, he ordered him to be put to death, upon an information that he was privy to Piso's conspiracy against his person. Not that he had any real proof of Seneca's being concerned in this plot, but only that he was glad to lay hold of any pretence for destroying him.—He left Seneca, however, at liberty to choose his manner of dying; who caused his veins to be opened immediately. His wife Paulina, who was very young in comparison of himself, had yet the resolution and affection to bear him company, and thereupon ordered her veins to be opened at the same time; but as Nero was not willing to make his cruelty more odious and insupportable than there seemed occasion for, he gave orders to have her death prevented: upon which her wounds were bound up, and the blood stopped, in just time enough to save her; though, as Tacitus says, she looked so miserably pale and wan all her life after, that it was easy to read the loss of her blood and spirits in her countenance. In the meantime, Seneca, finding his death slow and lingering, desired Statius Annius his physician to give him a dose of poison, which had been prepared some time before in case it should be wanted; but this not having its usual effect, he was carried to a hot bath, where he was at length stifled with the fumes. He died, as Lipsius conjectures, in the 63rd or 64th year of his age, and in about the 10th or 11th of Nero's reign. Tacitus, on mentioning his death, observes, that, as he entered the bath, he took of the water, and with it sprinkled some of his nearest domestics, saying, \"That he offered those libations to Jupiter the Deliverer.\" These words are an evident proof that Seneca was not a Christian, as some have imagined him to have been; and that the 13 epistles from Seneca to St Paul, and from St Paul to Seneca, are spurious pieces.\n\nHis philosophical works are well known.—They consist of 124 epistles and distinct treatises; and, except his books of physical questions, are chiefly of the moral kind, treating of anger, consolation, providence, tranquillity of mind, confidence, clemency, the shortness of life, a happy life, retirement, benefits. He has been justly censured by Quintilian and other critics, as one of the first corruptors of the Roman style; but his works are highly valuable, on account of the vast erudition which they discover, and the beautiful moral sentiments which they contain.\n\n**SENECIO, Groundsel**, a genus of plants belonging to the clas syngenesia, and to the order of polygama superflua; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae. See Botany Index.\n\n**SENEGAL**, a part of Negroland in Africa, the boundaries of which are not known. See Guinea.\n\n*Isle of SENEGAL*, sometimes called Saint Louis, is a small island in the mouth of the river Senegal, and according to Malkeleyne's tables is situated in N. Lat. 15° 53'. W. Long. 16° 31'. The Dutch were the first Europeans who settled at Senegal; but their colony was expelled by the French in 1687. It was taken by the English in 1692; and retaken by the French the year following. It was a second time taken possession of by the English in 1758; but in 1779 the French recovered it, and it was ceded by the British crown by the treaty of 1783.\n\nThe best account of this island which we have seen, is given in the interesting voyage of M. Sagnier to the coast of Africa. This adventurer visited Senegal in June 1785.\n\n\"The island (says he), properly speaking, is only a bank of sand in the middle of the river. It is 1000 geometrical paces long, and about 60 in its greatest width; is almost on a level with the river and with the sea, being defended from the latter by Barbary point, which is of greater elevation than the colony. The eastern branch of the river is the more considerable of the two, being about 400 toises across; the western-branch is only from 50 to 200 toises wide. The island consists entirely of burning sands, on the barren surface of which you sometimes meet with scattered flints, thrown out among their ballast by vessels coming from Goree, or with the ruins of buildings formerly erected by Europeans. There is scarcely such a thing as a garden upon the island; European seeds in general not thriving here. It is not surprising that the soil is unproductive; for the air is strongly impregnated with fæces, which pervades every thing, and confines even iron in a very short space of time. The heats are excessive, and rendered still more insupportable by the reflection of the sand; so that from ten in the morning until four in the afternoon it is almost impossible to do any work. During the months of January, February, March, and April, the heats are moderated; but in August and the following months they become so oppressive as even to affect the natives themselves. What effect then must they have upon the Europeans, suddenly transported into this burning climate? The nights are a little less fultry; not always, however, but only when the sea-breeze sets in. It is then that the inhabitants of the colony breathe a fresher air, for which they have been\nbeen longing the whole of the day; but this air in our climate would seem a burning vapour. The nights are nevertheless troublesome, notwithstanding the comforts of the sea-breeze. The instant the sun is set, we are assailed by an infinity of gnats, which are called myquitoes; their wings are very painful, and their multitudes incredible. The inhabitants find but a poor defence in their gauze-curtains. For my own part, accustomed as I had been to live among the Moors, I was but little annoyed by these insects. Being half a savage, I felt no desire to recommend myself to the favourable regard of the fair sex, and I was therefore under no necessity of taking care of my person. In imitation of my former masters, I smeared myself with butter, and this expedient prevented me at all times from these impertinent flingers, these spiteful enemies to the repose of the human kind.\n\n\"If the prospect of Senegal is not agreeable to the eye, much less are its environs, which are covered over only with sand, and overrun with mangos. It may be said, without exaggeration, that there is not a more forlorn situation to be found on the face of the inhabited globe, or a place in which the common necessaries of life are procured with greater difficulties. Water, that indispensable aliment of man, is here not potable. Wells are dug in the sand to the depth of five or six feet, and water is obtained by these means; but whatever pains are taken to freshen it, it ever retains a brackish taste. I have distilled this water myself, and observed that it always had a disagreeable flavour, which cannot fail to be hurtful to the health: it is true, that when the river is high, its streams are fresh, but the water is only the more dangerous. It proves the cause of most of those maladies which carry off the Europeans so rapidly, that at the end of every three years the colony has a fresh set of inhabitants. The blacks themselves, although accustomed to the climate, are not in this season free from disease.\"\n\nThe fort of St Louis is a quadrangle, and has two battalions of considerable strength; but the greatest security of the fort is its natural situation. The cannon of the fort are numerous, and the arsenal well supplied with small arms and stores. Besides this fort the French had no other upon the river, except Fort St Joseph, which stands about four leagues below the cataract at Govina, though they had a few factories in different parts.\n\nThe principal commodity of this country is that of gum Senegal (see Gum-Senegal), which is a valuable branch of commerce, as it is used in many arts and manufactures, particularly by the painters in water-colours, the silk weavers, and dyers.\n\nThe French import from the river Senegal not only gum-arabic, but elephants teeth, hides, bees-wax, gold-leaf, cotton, ostrich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.\n\nNotwithstanding the barrenness of the spot, Senegal contains more than 6000 negroes, including the captives of the Tapades, or negroes born of the black inhabitants of the country. They are never put up to sale, unless convicted of some crime. Their huts, constructed in the form of bee-hives, and supported upon four stakes, surround the habitations of the negro inhabitants. The entire height of these huts may rise to about 12 feet, the width in every direction is commonly from 10 to 12. The beds are composed of hurdles laid upon cross-bars, supported by forked stakes at the height of about a foot from the ground. Here the slaves sleep promiscuously, men, women, girls, and boys. A fire is made in the middle of the hut, which is filled with smoke, sufficient to stifle any man but a negro. The men are tall, and the women are accounted the handsomest negresses of all Africa. The Senegalese may be considered as the most courageous people of that part of the world, without even excepting the Moors. Their courage, however, is more nearly allied to temerity than to bravery. In the course of the voyage to Galam, they meet the greatest dangers with gaiety and song; they dread neither musket nor cannon, and are equally fearless of the cayman or crocodile. Should one of their companions be killed, and devoured by these animals before their face, they are not deterred from plunging into the water, if the working of the ship require it. These excellent qualifications which distinguish them, and on which they value themselves so much, do not, however, preserve them from the common contagion of the country, which inclines them all to rapine. They are emulous to surpass one another in all the arts of over-reaching and fraud. The conduct of the Europeans has, no doubt, encouraged these vices as much as the lemons of the marabouts, who inculcate the duty of plundering the Christians to the utmost of their power.\n\nThe Yolof negroes of Senegal are either Christians or Mahometans, or rather one and the other, or with more truth neither; religion being a matter of indifference to them. Those on the continent are of the same way of thinking, and their religious practices are kept up only for the sake of form. A bar of iron, a few beads, will make them change their opinion at will. By such means are they acted upon; a sufficient proof of their want of all religious principle. The marabouts, or priests, and the men of their law, are no better than the rest. \"I have examined the character of several of this order of men (says M. Saugnier), and even among the nation of the Poules, who are considered as great fanatics, I discovered that they were only publicly attached to their opinions. 'This white man (say they) does so; he is better informed than I, and why should not I imitate his example?' This way of reasoning is common to all that tract of country.\n\nThe colony of Senegal is surrounded with islands, which, on account of the proximity of the sea, are all more unhealthy than that on which the town is built. They are full of standing pools, that, when dried up by the sun, exhale a putrid vapour that carries mortality with it, and defoliates these islands. It is doubtless the same cause that takes off so many of the French at Senegal during the dangerous season of the year. This also may be in part occasioned by the bad quality of the water, which flows from the ponds in the neighbourhood of the colony, and though incorporated with that of the river, comes down little agitated by the current, and is easily distinguished by a vapidity of taste. This particular is, in my opinion, essentially worthy of notice, and if properly attended to by our medical men, might become the means of preserving many lives.\n\nSENEGAL-River, see NIGER. As so little is known respecting this river, which is one of the greatest in Africa, any additional information must be interesting. We\nWe shall therefore present our readers with the account contained in the communications presented to the Association for promoting the discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, which, as far as we know, is the latest and most authentic.\n\nThe river known to Europeans by the name of Niger or Senegal runs on the south of the kingdom of Caffina, in its course towards Tombuctou; and if the report which Ben Alli heard in that town may be credited, it is afterwards lost in the sands on the south of the country of Tombuctou. In the map (a), only the known part of its course is marked by a line; and the supposititious part by dots. It may be proper to observe, that the Africans have two names for this river; that is, Neel il Abee, or river of the Negroes; and Neel il Kheer, or the great river. They also term the Nile (that is the Egyptian river) Neel Shem; so that the term Neel, from whence our Nile, is nothing more than the appellative of river; like Ganges, or Sinde.\n\nOf this river the rise and termination are unknown, but the course is from east to west. So great is its rapidity, that no vessel can ascend its stream; and such is the want of skill, or such the absence of commercial inducements among the nations who inhabit its borders, that even with the current, neither vessels nor boats are seen to navigate. In one place, indeed, the traveller finds accommodations for the passage of himself and of his goods; but even there, though the ferrymen, by the indulgence of the sultan of Caffina, are exempted from all taxes, the boat which conveys the merchandise is nothing more than an ill-constructed raft; for the planks are fastened to the timbers with ropes, and the seams are closed both within and without by a plaster of tough clay, of which a large provision is always carried on the raft, for the purpose of excluding the stream wherever its entrance is observed.\n\nThe depth of the river at the place of passage, which is more than a hundred miles to the south of the city of Caffina, the capital of the empire of that name, is estimated at 23 or 24 feet English. Its depth is from 10 to 12 pecks, each of which is 27 inches.\n\nIts width is such, that even at the island of Gongoo, where the ferrymen reside, the sound of the loudest voice from the northern shore is scarcely heard; and at Tom- buctou, where the name of Gneuwa, or black, is given to the stream, the width is described as being that of the Thames at Westminster. In the rainy season it swells above its banks, and not only floods the adjacent lands, but often sweeps before it the cattle and cottages of the short-sighted or too confident inhabitants.\n\nThat the people who live in the neighbourhood of the Niger should refuse to profit by its navigation, may justly surprise the traveller: but much greater is his astonishment, when he finds that even the food which the bounty of the stream would give, is uselessly offered to their acceptance; for such is the want of skill, or such the settled dislike of the people to this sort of provision, that the fish with which the river abounds are left in undisturbed possession of its waters.\n\n(a) The map alluded to is that which accompanies the volume which contains the proceedings of the Association. This work was printed in 1791.\nkeeper, appears from their halting to him, though at a great distance. He furnishes that cow which is in the habit of straying farthest with a small bell, and by her arrival he knows that all the rest are assembled.\n\n**SENNA**, the leaf of the *caffia senna* of Linnæus. See *Cassia*, *Botany* and *Materia Medica Index*.\n\nSenna appears to have been cultivated in England in the time of Parkinson (1629); and Miller tells us, that by keeping these plants in a hotbed all the summer, he frequently had them in flower; but adds, it is very rarely that they perfect their seeds in England. There can be little doubt, however, but that some of the British possessions may be found well enough adapted to the growth of this vegetable, and that the patriotic views of the Society for encouraging Arts, &c., which has offered a reward to those who succeed in the attempt, will be ultimately accomplished.\n\nSenna, which is in common use as a purgative, was first known to the Arabian physicians Serapion and Melius: the first among the Greeks who takes any notice of it is Aetius, but he only speaks of the fruit, and not of the leaves. To remove the disagreeable taste of this medicine, Dr Cullen recommends coriander seeds; and, for preventing the gripes with which it is sometimes attended, he thinks the warmer aromatics, as cardamoms or ginger, would be more effectual.\n\nThe *Senna Italica*, or blunt-leaved senna, is a variety of the Alexandrian species; which, by its cultivation in the south of France (Provence), has been found to assume this change. It is less purgative than the pointed-leaved senna, and is therefore to be given in larger doses. It was employed as a cathartic by Dr Wright at Jamaica, where it grows on the land banks near the sea.\n\n**SENNAAR**, a country of Africa, bordering upon Abyssinia, with the title of a kingdom; the present government of which was established in the 16th century by a race of negroes named, in their own language, *Shillook*. This country, together with all the northern parts of Africa, had been overrun by the Saracens during the rapid conquests of the caliphs; but instead of erecting any distinct principalities here, as in other parts, they had incorporated themselves with the old inhabitants called *Shepherds*, whom they found at their arrival; had converted them to their religion, and become one people with them. In 1504 the Shillook, a people before unknown, came from the western banks of the river Bahiar el Abiad, which empties itself into the Nile, and conquered the country; allowing the Arabs, however, to retain their possessions on condition of paying them a certain tribute. These founded the city of Sennaar, and have ever since continued to carry on an intercourse with Egypt in the way of merchandise. At the establishment of their monarchy the whole nation were Pagans, but soon after became converts to Mohammedanism, and took the name of *Funges*, an appellation signifying \"lords or conquerors,\" and likewise free citizens. Mr Bruce, who passed through this country in his return from Abyssinia, gives a list of 20 kings who have reigned in it since the conquest of the Shillook.\n\nThis country is inhabited by a people so barbarous and brutish, that no history of them can be expected. One of the most remarkable of their customs is, that the king ascends the throne with the expectation of being murdered whenever the general council of the nation thinks proper. The dreadful office of executioner belongs to one single officer, styled, in the language of the country, *Sid el Coom*; and who is always a relation of the monarch himself. It was from his registers that Mr Bruce took the list of the kings already mentioned, with the number of years they reigned, and which may therefore be received as authentic. The *Sid el Coom* in office at the time that Mr Bruce visited this country was named Achmet, and was one of his best friends. He had murdered the late king, with three of his sons, one of whom was an infant at its mother's breast; he was also in daily expectation of performing the same office to the reigning sovereign. He was by no means reserved concerning the nature of his office, but answered freely every question that was put to him. When asked by Mr Bruce why he murdered the king's young son in his father's presence? he answered, that he did it from a principle of duty to the king himself, who had a right to see his son killed in a lawful and regular manner, which was by cutting his throat with a sword, and not in a more painful or ignominious way, which the malice of his enemies might possibly have inflicted.\n\nThe king, he said, was very little concerned at the sight of his son's death, but he was so very unwilling to die himself, that he often prefled the executioner to let him escape; but finding his intretries ineffectual, he submitted at last without resistance. On being asked whether he was not afraid of coming into the presence of the king, considering the office he might possibly have to perform? he replied, that he was not in the least afraid on this account; that it was his duty to be with the king every morning, and very late in the evening; that the king knew he would have no hand in promoting his death; but that, when the matter was absolutely determined, the rest was only an affair of decency; and it would undoubtedly be his own choice, rather to fall by the hand of his own relation in private than by a hired assassin, an Arab, or a Christian slave, in the fight of the populace. Baady the king's father, having the misfortune to be taken prisoner, was sent to Atbara to Welled Haflan the governor of that province to be put to death there. But the king, who was a strong man, and always armed, kept so much upon his guard, that Welled could find no opportunity of killing him but by running him through the back with a lance as he was washing his hands. For this Welled himself was afterwards put to death; not on account of the murder itself, but because, in the first place, he, who was not the proper executioner, had presumed to put the king to death; and, in the next, because he had done it with a lance, whereas the only lawful instrument was a sword.\n\nOn the death of any of the sovereigns of this country, his eldest son succeeds to the throne of course; on which as many of his brothers as can be found are apprehended, and put to death by the *Sid el Coom* in the manner already related. Women are excluded from the sovereignty here as well as in Abyssinia. The princesses of Sennaar, however, are worse off than those of Abyssinia, having no settled income, nor being treated in any degree better than the daughters of private persons. The king is obliged, once in his lifetime, to plough and sow a piece of ground; whence he is named *Baady*, the \"countryman or peasant;\" a title\ntitle as common among the monarchs of Sennaar as Caesar was among the Romans. The royal family were originally negroes; but as the kings frequently marry Arab women, the white colour of the mother is communicated to the child. This, we are told by Mr Bruce, is invariably the case, when a negroman of Sennaar marries an Arab woman; and it holds equally good, when an Arab man marries a negro woman; and he likewise informs us, that he never saw one black Arab all the time he was at Sennaar.\n\nThe soil and climate of this country is extremely unfavourable both to man and beast. The men are strong and remarkable for their size, but short lived; and there is such a mortality among the children, that were it not for a constant importation of slaves, the metropolis would be depopulated. The shortness of their lives, however, may perhaps be accounted for, from their indulging themselves from their infancy in every kind of excess. No horse, mule, or ass, will live at Sennaar or for many miles round it. The calf is the same with bullocks, sheep, dogs, cats, and poultry; all of them must go to the sands every half-year. It is difficult to account for this mortality; though Mr Bruce affirms it is the case everywhere about the metropolis of this country, where the soil is a fat earth, during the first season of the rains. Two greyhounds which he brought along with him from Atbara, and the mules he brought from Abyssinia, lived only a few weeks after their arrival at Sennaar. Several of the kings of Sennaar have tried to keep lions, but it was always found impossible to preserve them alive after the rains. They will live, however, as well as other quadrupeds, in the sands, at no great distance from the capital. No species of tree except the lemon flowers near this city; the cultivation of the rose has often been attempted, but always without success. In other respects, however, the soil of Sennaar is exceedingly fertile, being said to yield 300 fold; but this is thought by Mr Bruce to be a great exaggeration. It is all sown with dora or millet, which is the principal food of the people; wheat and rice are also produced here, which are sold by the pound, even in years of plenty. The soil all round is strongly impregnated with salt, so that a sufficient quantity to serve the inhabitants is extracted from it.\n\nSennaar, a city of Africa, the capital of the kingdom of that name. It stands according to Mr Bruce's observations, in N. Lat. 13° 34' 36\", E. Long. 35° 30' 36\"; on the west side of the Nile, and close upon the banks of it; the ground on which it stands being just high enough to prevent the inundation. The town is very populous, and contains a great many houses. In Poncet's time they were all of one story; but now most of the houses have houses of two stories high. They are built of clay mixed with a very little straw, and have all flat roofs; which shows that the rains here must be much less in quantity than to the southward. During the time of Mr Bruce's residence here, however, there was one week of continual rain, and the Nile, after loud thunder and great darkness to the south, increased violently; the whole stream being covered with the wrecks of houses and their furniture; so that he supposed it had destroyed many villages to the southward. About 12 miles to the north-west of Sennaar is a collection of villages named Shaddly, from a great saint of that name, who constructed several granaries here.\n\nThere are no other than large pits dug in the ground, Sennaar, and well plastered in the inside with clay, then filled with grain when it is at its lowest price, and afterwards covered up and plastered again at top; these pits they call matamores. On any prospect of dearth they are opened, and the corn sold to the people. About 24 miles north of Shaddly there is another set of granaries name Wed-cloud, still greater than Shaddly; and upon these two the subsistence of the Arabs principally depends; for as these people are at continual war with each other, and direct their fury rather against the crops than the persons of their enemies, the whole of them would be unavoidably starved, were it not for this extraordinary resource. Small villages of soldiers are scattered up and down this country to guard the grain after it is sown, which is only that species of millet named dora; the soil, it is said, being incapable of producing any other. There are great hollows made in the earth at proper distances throughout the country, which fill with water in the rainy season, and are afterwards of great use to the Arabs as they pass from the cultivated parts to the sands. The fly, which is such a dreadful enemy to the cattle, is never seen to the northward of Shaddly.\n\nTo the westward of these granaries the country is quite full of trees as far as the river Abiad, or El-ace. In this extensive plain there arise two ridges of mountains, one called Jebel Moira, or the Mountain of water; the other Jebel Segud, or the Cold Mountain. Both of them enjoy a fine climate, and serve for a protection to the farms about Shaddly and Aboud already mentioned. Here also are fortresses placed in the way of the Arabs, which serve to oblige them to pay tribute in their flight from the cultivated country, during the rains, to the dry lands of Atbara. Each of these districts is governed by a descendant of their ancient and native princes, who long reigned all the power of the Arabs. Sacrifices of a horrid nature are said to have been offered up on these mountains till about the year 1554, when one of the kings of Sennaar besieged first one and then the other of the princes in their mountains; and having forced them to surrender, he fastened a chain of gold to each of their ears, exposed them in the market-place at Sennaar, and sold them for slaves at less than a farthing each. Soon after this they were circumcised, converted to the Mahometan religion, and restored to their kingdoms.\n\n\"Nothing (says Mr Bruce) is more pleasant than Vol. iv. the country around Sennaar in the end of August and beginning of September. The grain, being now sprung up, makes the whole of this immense plain appear a level green land, interspersed with great lakes of water, and ornamented at certain intervals with groups of villages; the conical tops of the houses presenting at a distance the appearance of small encampments. Through this very extensive plain winds the Nile, a delightful river there, above a mile broad, full to the very brim, but never overflowing. Everywhere on these banks are seen herds of the most beautiful cattle of various kinds. The banks of the Nile about Sennaar resemble the pleasant part of Holland in the summer season; but soon after, when the rains cease, and the sun exerts its utmost influence, the dora begins to ripen, the leaves to turn yellow and to rot, the lakes to putrefy, smell, become full of vermin, and all its beauty suddenly disappears; bare scorched Nubia returns, and all its terrors of poisonous...\"\nSennaar, famous winds and moving sands, glowing and ventilated with sultry blasts, which are followed by a troop of terrible attendants; epilepsies, apoplexies, violent fevers, oblitinate agues, and lingering painful dyfenteries, still more oblitinate and mortal.\n\n\"War and treason seem to be the only employment of this horrid people, whom Heaven has separated by almost impalpable defects from the rest of mankind; confining them to an accursed spot, seemingly to give them an earnest in time of the only other curse which He has reserved to them for an eternal hereafter.\"\n\nWith regard to the climate of the country round Sennaar, Mr Bruce has several very curious observations. The thermometer rises in the shade to 119 degrees; but the degree indicated by this instrument does not at all correspond with the sensations occasioned by it; nor with the colour of the people who live under it.\n\n\"Nations of blacks (as he) live within latitude 13 and 14 degrees; about 10 degrees south of them, nearly under the line, all the people are white, as we had an opportunity of observing daily in the Galla. Sennaar, which is in latitude 13 degrees, is hotter by the thermometer 50 degrees, when the sun is most distant from it, than Gondar, which is a degree farther south, when the sun is vertical.—Cold and hot (says our author) are terms merely relative, not determined by the latitude, but elevation of the place. When, therefore, we say hot, some other explanation is necessary concerning the place where we are, in order to give an adequate idea of the sensations of that heat upon the body, and the effects of it upon the lungs. The degree of the thermometer conveys this but very imperfectly; 90 degrees is excessively hot at Loheia in Arabia Felix; and yet the latitude of Loheia is but 15 degrees; whereas 90 degrees at Sennaar is only warm as to fence; though Sennaar, as we have already said, is in latitude 13 degrees.\n\n\"At Sennaar, then, I call it cold, when one fully clothed and at rest feels himself in want of fire. I call it cool, when one fully clothed and at rest feels he could bear more covering all over, or in part, than he has at that time. I call it temperate, when a man so clothed, and at rest, feels no such want, and can take moderate exercise, such as walking about a room without sweating. I call it warm, when a man, so clothed, does not sweat when at rest; but, on taking moderate exercise, sweats, and again cools. I call it hot, when a man at rest, or with moderate exercise, sweats excessively. I call it very hot, when a man with thin, or little clothing, sweats much, though at rest. I call it excessive hot, when a man, in his shirt and at rest, sweats excessively, when all motion is painful, and the knees feel feeble, as if after a fever. I call it extreme hot, when the strength fails, a disposition to faint comes on, a strangeness is found in the tempies, as if a small cord was drawn tight about the head, the voice impaired, the skin dry, and the head seems more than ordinarily large and light. This, I apprehend, denotes death at hand; but this is rarely if ever effected by the sun alone, without the addition of that poisonous wind which pursued us through Athara, where it has, no doubt, contributed to the total extinction of every thing that hath the breath of life. A thermometer, graduated upon this scale, would exhibit a figure very different from the common one; for I am convinced by experiment, that a web of the finest muslin, wrapt round the body at Sennaar, will occasion at mid-day a greater sensation of heat in the body, than a rise of 5 degrees in the thermometer of Fahrenheit.\n\n\"At Sennaar, from 70 to 78 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer is cool; from 79 to 92 temperate; at 92 degrees begins warmth. Although the degree of the thermometer marks a greater heat than is felt by the body of us strangers, it seems to me that the sensations of the natives bear still a less proportion to that degree than ours. On the 2d of August, while I was lying perfectly enervated on a carpet in a room deluged with water at 12 o'clock, the thermometer at 116, I saw several black labourers pulling down a house, working with great vigour, without any symptoms of being incommodeed.\"\n\nThe dress of the people of Sennaar consists only of a long shirt of blue cloth, which wraps them up from the under part of the neck to the feet. It does not, however, conceal the neck in the men, though it does in the women. The men sometimes have a fah tied about their middle; and both men and women go barefooted in the houses, whatever their rank may be. The floors of their apartments, especially those of the women, are covered with Persian carpets. Both men and women anoint themselves, at least once a day, with camel's grease mixed with civet, which, they imagine, softens their skins, and preserves them from cutaneous eruptions; of which they are so fearful, that they confine themselves to the house if they observe the smallest pimple on their skins. With the same view of preserving their skins, though they have a clean shirt every day, they sleep with a greased one at night, having no other covering but this. Their bed is a tanned bull's hide, which this constant greasing softens very much; it is also very cool, though it gives a smell to their bodies from which they cannot be freed by any washing.\n\nOur author gives a very curious description of the queens and ladies of the court at Sennaar. He had access to them as a physician, and was permitted to pay his visit alone. He was first thrown into a large square apartment, where there were about 50 black women, all quite naked excepting a very narrow piece of cotton rag about their waists. As he was musing whether these were all queens, one of them took him by the hand, and led him into another apartment much better lighted than the former. Here he saw three women sitting upon a bench or sofa covered with blue Surat cloth; they themselves being clothed from the neck to the feet with cotton shirts of the same colour. These were three of the king's wives; his favourite, who was one of the number, appeared to be about six feet high, and so corpulent that our traveller imagined her to be the largest creature he had seen next to the elephant and rhinoceros. Her features perfectly resembled those of a negro: a ring of gold passed through her under lip, and weighed it down, till, like a flap, it covered her chin, leaving her teeth bare, which were small and very fine. The inside of her lip was made black with antimony. Her ears reached down to her shoulders, and had the appearance of wings: there was a gold ring in each of them about five inches in diameter, and somewhat smaller than a man's little finger; the weight of which had drawn down the hole where her ear was pierced.\npierced so much that three fingers might easily pass above the ring. She had a gold necklace like that called Eclavange, of several rows, one below another; to which were hung rows of sequins pierced. She had two manacles of gold upon her ankles larger than those used for chaining felons. Our author could not imagine how it was possible for her to walk with them, till he was informed that they were hollow. The others were dressed much in the same manner; only there was one who had chains coming from her ears to the outside of each nostril, where they were fastened. A ring was also put through the gristle of her nose, and which hung down to the opening of her mouth; having all together something of the appearance of a horse's bridle; and Mr. Bruce thinks that she must have breathed with difficulty.\n\nThe poorer sort of the people of Sennaar live on the flour or bread of millet; the rich make puddings of this, toasting the flour before the fire, and putting milk and butter into it; besides which they use beef partly roasted and partly raw. They have very fine and fat horned cattle, but the meat commonly sold in the market is camel's flesh. The liver and spare rib of this animal are always eaten raw; nor did our author see one instance to the contrary all the time he was in the country. Hog's flesh is not sold in the market; but all the common people of Sennaar eat it openly; those in office, who pretend to be Mahometans, doing the same in secret.\n\nThere are no manufactures in this country, and the principal article of trade is blue Surat cloth. In former times, when caravans could pass with safety, Indian goods were brought in quantities from Jidda to Sennaar, and then dispersed over the country of the blacks. The returns were made in gold, a powder called tibbar, civet, rhinoceroses horns, ivory, ostrich feathers, and above all slaves or glafs, more of these being exported from Sennaar than from all the east of Africa. This trade, however, as well as that of the gold and ivory, is almost destroyed; though the gold is still reputed to be the best and purest in Africa, and is therefore bought at Mocha to be carried to India, where it all centres at last.\n\nSennertus, Daniel, an eminent physician, was born in 1572 at Brellaw; and in 1593 he was sent to Wittemberg, where he made great progress in philosophy and physic. He visited the universities of Leipzig, Jena, Francfort on the Oder, and Berlin; but soon returned to Wittemberg, where he was promoted to the degree of doctor of physic, and soon after to a professorship in the same faculty. He was the first who introduced the study of chemistry into that university; he gained a great reputation by his works and practice, and was very generous to the poor. He died of the plague at Wittemberg, in 1637. He raised himself enemies by contradicting the ancients. He thought the seed of all living creatures animated, and that the soul of this seed produces organization. He was accused of impiety for asserting that the souls of beasts are not material; for this was affirmed to be the same thing with asserting that they are immortal; but he rejected this consequence, as he well might do. See Metaphysics, Part III. chap. vi.\n\nSenones, in Ancient Geography, a people of Gallia Celtica, situated on the Sequana to the south of the Parili, near the confluence of the Jeauna or Yonne with the above mentioned river. Their most considerable exploit was their invasion of Italy, and taking and burning Rome, as related under that article. This was done by a colony of them long before transported into Italy, and settled on the Adriatic. Their capital, Agendicum in Gaul, was in the lower age called Senones, now Sens. In Italy the Senones extended themselves as far as the river Adis; but were afterwards driven beyond the Rubicon, which became the boundary of Gallia Cisalpina, (Polybius, Strabo.)\n\nSensation, in Philosophy, the perception of external objects by means of the senses. See Metaphysics, Part I. chap. i.\n\nSense, a faculty of the soul whereby it perceives external objects by means of the impressions they make on certain organs of the body. See Metaphysics, Part I. and Anatomy, No 137, &c.\n\nCommon Sense, is a term that has been variously used by both ancient and modern writers. With some it has been synonymous with public sense; with others it has denoted prudence; in certain instances, it has been confounded with some of the powers of taste; and, accordingly, those who commit egregious blunders with regard to decorum, saying and doing what is offensive to their company, and inconsistent with their own character, have been charged with a defect in common sense. Some men are distinguished by an uncommon acuteness in discovering the characters of others; and this talent has been sometimes called common sense; similar to which is that use of the term, which makes it to signify that experience and knowledge of life which is acquired by living in society. To this meaning Quintilian refers, speaking of the advantages of a public education: \"Senium ipsum qui communis dictatur, ubi defici, cum se a congruia, qui non hominibus solum, sed multis quoque animalibus naturalis est, segregari.\" Lib. i. cap. 2.\n\nBut the term common sense hath in modern times been used to signify that power of the mind which perceives truth, or commands belief, not by progressive argumentation, but by an instantaneous, instinctive, and irresistible impulse; derived neither from education nor from habit, but from nature; acting independently of our will, whenever its object is presented, according to an established law, and therefore called sense; and acting in a similar manner upon all, or at least upon a great majority of mankind, and therefore called common sense. See Metaphysics, No 127.\n\nMoral Sense, is a determination of the mind to be pleased with the contemplation of those affections, actions, or characters, of rational agents, which we call good or virtuous.\n\nThis moral sense of beauty in actions and affections may appear strange at first view; some of our moralists themselves are offended at it in Lord Shaftesbury, as being accustomed to deduce every approbation or aversion from rational views of interest. It is certain that his Lordship has carried the influence of the moral sense very far, and some of his followers have carried it farther. The advocates for the selfish system seem to drive their opinions to the opposite extreme, and we have elsewhere endeavoured to show that the truth lies between the contending parties. See Moral Philosophy, No 27—32.\nPublic SENSE is defined by the noble author of the Characteristics to be an innate propensity to be pleased with the happiness of others, and to be uneasy at their misery. It is found, he says, in a greater or less degree in all men, and was sometimes called κοινωνία, or senus communis, by ancient writers.\n\nOf the reality of this public sense we have great doubts. The conduct of savages, who are more under the influence of original instinct than civilized men, gives no countenance to it. Their affections seem all to be selfish, or at least to spring from self-love variously modified. For the happiness of their wives they have very little regard, considering them merely as instruments of their own pleasure, and valuing them for nothing else. Hence they make them toil, while they themselves indulge in little idleness. To their children we believe they exhibit strong symptoms of attachment, as soon as they derive affluence from them in war, or in the benefits of the chase; but during the helpless years of infancy, the child is left by the selfish father wholly to the care and protection of its wretched mother; who, impelled by the flattery of all females to their young, cherishes her offspring with great fondness.\n\nThe savage is, indeed, susceptible of strong attachments, similar to that which we call friendship; but such attachments are no proofs of disinterested benevolence, or what his Lordship calls the public sense. Two barbarous heroes are probably first linked together by the observation of each other's prowess in war, or their skill in pursuing their game; for such observation cannot fail to show them that they may be useful to one another; and we have elsewhere shown how real friendship may spring from sentiments originally selfish. The savage is very much attached to his horde or tribe, and this attachment resembles patriotism; but patriotism itself is not a sentiment of pure benevolence delighting in the happiness of others, and grieving at their misery; for the patriot prefers his own country to all others, and is not very scrupulous with respect to the rectitude of the means by which he promotes its interest, or depresses its rivals. The savage pursues with relentless rigour the enemies of himself or of the tribe to which he belongs; shows no mercy to them when in his power, but puts them to the cruellest death, and carries their scalps to the leader of his party. These facts, which cannot be controverted, are perfectly irreconcilable with innate benevolence, or a public sense comprehending the whole race of men; and shew the truth of that theory by which we have in another place endeavoured to account for all the passions, social as well as selfish. See PASSION.\n\nSENSES, Pleasures and Pains of. The natural agreeableness, disagreeableness and indifference of our sensations and perceptions, present to the mind an important and extensive field of inquiry; and on this subject we shall here make a few observations. All our senses have been certainly bestowed upon us for wise and beneficent purposes; and, accordingly, we find, that all of them, when properly cultivated, or exercised and improved, are capable of affording us much pleasure. The senses of smell and of taste seem rather intended for the preservation of our animal existence, and in this point of view are properly an object of the natural history of man; whilst the other three seem to be more peculiarly intended for our mental improvement, and accordingly form an object of intellectual and of moral philosophy.\n\nAnd agreeably to this we know that we derive a great deal of very useful knowledge, in an easy and simple manner, concerning the objects that surround us, in the early part of life, from all the senses, particularly from sight and touch, and this too without labour or study. But this is not the only purpose for which the senses were designed.\n\nIt being thus certain, that the senses were bestowed upon us partly to preserve our animal existence, and partly for our mental improvement, it seems reasonable, even a priori, to expect that nature would attach some pleasure to such use and exercise of them, as are calculated to promote these ends, and pain to the contrary; particularly in those instances in which she has left the management of them subject to our own control. And accordingly we cannot but observe what delight we derive from our senses, especially in the morning of life, by which it would seem, that nature intended thus willingly to invite us to the proper exercise and improvement of them; and as it were unconsciously, acquire much useful knowledge. It is this species of pleasure that supports and excites boys in the constant and often immoderate exercise of their organs of voluntary motion; the powers of which are thus increased and invigorated.\n\nThe exercise and improvement of the senses being subservient to our intellectual improvement, nature has also kindly attached much refined and rational pleasure to the mental exertions; so that we are thus seduced, as it were, to the cultivation of the various extraordinary powers and faculties of the mind.\n\nIt is evident that nature has given such organs and faculties to man, as are calculated not only to make him live, but also to render life agreeable. Here too we obtain a slight glimpse at least of some of the final causes of the pleasures of sense. But if it be asked how it happens, that there are such wide diversities between our sensations, some being by nature very agreeable to all men, and some as disagreeable, whilst there are others so indifferent, as to give neither pleasure nor pain, we must confess, that we can give no satisfactory answer, to show how so many very different sensations are produced by various kinds of impressions made on certain organs of the body, and how all these different impressions excite such sensations as suggest not only corresponding perceptions and external qualities, but at the same time affect the mind with pleasure, pain, trouble, anxiety, or difficulty. To be successful in these inquiries, we must presuppose some knowledge of the nature of the connection subsisting between the mind and body, which there is reason to think is placed beyond the limits prescribed by nature to human research.\n\nThe pleasure or pain which constantly attends certain sensations is not uniform in degree, but varies considerably, not only in different individuals, but even in the same person at different times. It is not thus with the sensations themselves. These are always constant and uniform. The same kind of impression, when the organs &c. are found, uniformly and invariably produce similar sensations; and these are invariably followed by the perception of their own peculiar exciting cause. For any particular impression is never known to excite in the same person a new sensation, or the perception of an external object different from that which it previously suggested.\nSensations, suggested, excepting in cases of disease. And when it does rarely occur, as in those who cannot distinguish a particular colour, smell or taste, from certain others, we uniformly attribute it to disease or malformation.\n\nWere not thus to have uniformly similar sensations and perceptions of external objects from similar impressions, the senses would not be at all subservient to our intellectual improvement; hence, by giving different sensations concerning the same or similar objects at different times, they would render it impossible for us to be certain of anything, or to benefit by experience.\n\nThe effects of custom, which are at all times so considerable and evident with respect both to the mind and body, (as in the case of particular organs or faculties much improved by attention and exercise,) have little or no influence at all in interrupting or modifying this uniformity in our sensations and perceptions. For no sound, or properly organized person will, either naturally or by custom, ever mistake hardness for softness, red for green, or sweet for bitter. But the influence of custom in modifying the pains and pleasures of sense is well known and considerable. For a person, who can most accurately distinguish sweetness from sourness, will at the same time, either by particular conformation, or more frequently in consequence of use and habit, prefer wormwood to tobacco to honey.\n\nBut although we may despair of being ever able to discover the physical cause of the pleasures and pains of the senses, we may, however, advance a little by observing and registering particular facts. It is, accordingly, of use to remark, that every species of sensation, if its nature be otherwise unchanged, is agreeable or disagreeable in proportion to its strength or intensity. For there is no sensation, however agreeable, that will not become disagreeable, and even intolerable, if it be immoderately intense. Whilst on the contrary, those which by their strength and nature are very troublesome, if rendered more mild and moderate become not only tolerable, but agreeable. Thus, with respect to the senses it would seem, that pain and pleasure are only different degrees of the same feeling, and when we consider the great varieties of which the sensation, not only of different organs, but even of any one of them, is susceptible, and that each degree of these may be accompanied with pleasure or pain, more or less, we must conclude that the pains and pleasures of sense are capable of numberless modifications both in degree and in kind.\n\nWe frequently observe, that sensations which were at first agreeable, if often repeated, lose their relish, though the nature and strength of the impressions be the same; whilst others from being at first very disagreeable, as the taste of tobacco and opium, become very pleasing, though the nature and strength of the impressions have suffered no change. For the explanation of such facts as these we must have recourse to the effects of custom. Thus, in both these opposite cases, the sensations from being often repeated, lose part of their strength, and of the novelty, of course, of their first impressions; and, with respect to the former instance, being unable to command the attention, become in the course of time almost wholly, or altogether neglected, whilst in the latter case, from being very offensive, they become highly agreeable. But if it be asked why habit and custom produce these effects, and in what manner, we are unable to explain it farther, than by saying, since the fact is unquestionable, that such is the nature of the human constitution. Of the effects themselves, no man can entertain a doubt; and their causes, though at present unknown, may by time and inquiry be further developed and simplified. \"The labyrinth,\" says Dr. Reid, \"may be too intricate, and the thread too fine, to be traced through all its windings; but if we stop where we can trace it no farther, and secure the ground we have gained, there is no harm done; a quicker eye may in time trace it farther.\"\n\nThese principles are capable of affording us still farther explanations. Why are new sensations always more agreeable and variety so pleasing? Because they fix the attention more, and are not as yet blunted by frequent repetition or by habit. It is because some sensations lose their wonted effects by custom and by repetition, that we require stronger ones, or at least stronger impressions on the organs and nerves, to increase or continue our pleasures. It is also in consequence of their becoming less poignant through habit that we neglect so many pleasures, which we hardly know to be such, till they have flown for ever; and it is because in the morning of life everything has more novelty, and because habit has not destroyed their relish, that the pleasures of youth are much more intense than those of age. The degree of pleasure is similar to that which a blind man would feel on being made to see, or to that which a man would enjoy on suddenly acquiring a new sensitive faculty, although by long use and habit these pleasures are at present for the most part or wholly blotted away.\n\nAlthough most sensations, when strong and lively enough to make themselves accurately and easily distinguished, generally please most, each in its own kind and manner; still, as there are different kinds of pleasure, different sensations may please the mind in various ways; and accordingly, it is not from the lustre of the midday sun, nor from the beautiful and lively appearance of all nature at noon, solely that the eyes derive pleasure, any more than grand musical sounds are the only things that please the ear. For we often contemplate with a very different and a very considerable degree of pleasure the sublime and awful scenes of nature, the twilight darkness of the shady grove, and even the gloomy horror of night itself. We listen with delight to the tempest shaking the forest, as well as to the gentle murmurs of the palling stream. There is even a time when nothing gives so much pleasure as darkness, silence, and the absence of all sensation.\n\nAmidst the great variety of good and evil with which we are everywhere surrounded, it is a matter of the highest importance to be able to discern aright. This we should be incapable of doing were we not endowed with agreeable as well as painful sensations. These serve to direct our choice. Whatever contributes in any degree to our preservation and to the improvement of our organs and faculties, is accompanied with pleasure; and on the contrary, when we are threatened with danger a painful sensation gives us the alarm. It is to the establishment of this law that we are indebted for the duration of our lives, the improved and vigorous state of our faculties, and the enjoyment of that small portion of happiness allotted to us by nature. \"God,\" (says a French writer) having endowed man with various faculties, bodily as well as intellectual, in order to promote his hap-\npinses, also vouchsafes to conduct him to this noble end, not only by the deductions of reason, but also by the force of instinct and sensation, which are more powerful and efficacious principles. Thus nature, by a sensation of pain, instantaneously apprises us of what might prove hurtful to us; and, on the contrary, by an agreeable sensation, gently leads us to whatever may tend to the preservation of our existence, and to the perfect state of our faculties, these being the two points on which our happiness depends. Our faculties can neither be of use, nor display themselves farther than as we exercise them; motion or action is therefore so necessary to us, that without it we must inevitably sink into a deplorable state of insensibility and languor. On the other hand, as we are weak and limited creatures, all excessive and violent action would impair and destroy our organs; we must therefore use only moderate motion or exercise, since by these means the use or perfection of our faculties is reconciled with our chief interest, which is self-preservation. Now it is to this happy medium, I mean a moderate exercise of our faculties that the author of our nature has so wisely annexed pleasure.\n\nThe pleasures of sense are thus confined within narrow limits; for they cannot be much increased without pain, or often repeated without losing their relish, at least in a great measure; nor can they be long continued, partly for the same reason, and because they exhaust the mind, or rather the nervous system. Hence we see that our animal appetites are confined within a narrow range, as is evident from the effects of excess in eating and drinking. All our sensitive powers are impaired; whilst, on the contrary, our intellectual powers are strengthened and improved by use and exercise. And in proportion as we indulge our sensitive powers, our desires of indulgence increase, whilst the pleasures, which are the objects of these desires, become regularly less poignant. These, indeed, are wise regulations of nature; for it would seem as if she intended to whisper gently to us in this way, by means of practical experience, that we are not born solely for the enjoyment of pleasure, at least not for that of the pleasures of the senses; for all of them, as we have already remarked, if much indulged, lead to little pains and disgust, and sometimes to considerable pain. And indeed, just as pleasure passes thus readily into trouble and pain, so does the sudden cessation of pain, at last when this has been considerable, produce often extraordinary pleasure. So that we may here apply the beautiful allegory of the divine Socrates, \"that although pleasure and pain are contrary in their nature, and have their faces turned different ways, yet that Jupiter hath tied them to together, that he who lays hold of the one draws the other along with it.\"\n\nWe have just said, that the sudden cessation of pain, at least when this has been considerable, produces often extraordinary pleasure. But this opinion seems to be denied in a late inquiry concerning taste. \"Among the pleasures of sense,\" says Mr Knight, \"more particularly among those belonging to touch, there is a certain class, which, though arising from negative causes, are nevertheless real and positive pleasures: as when we gradually sink from any violent or excessive degree of action or irritation into a state of tranquillity and repose. I say gradually; for if the transition be sudden and abrupt, it will not be pleasant; the pleasure arising from the inverted action of the nerves, and not from the utter cessation of action. From this inverted action arises the gratification which we receive from a cool breeze, when the body has been excessively heated; or from the rocking of a cradle, or the gentle motion of a boat, or easy carriage, after having been fatigued with violent exercise. Such, too, is that which twilight, or the gloomy shade of a thicket, affords to the eye after it has been dazzled by the blaze of the midday sun; and such, likewise, is that which the ear receives from the gradual diminution of loudness of tone in music.\" That pleasure follows a gradual cessation of any violent action or irritation, we mean not to deny; but we are at a loss to comprehend how it follows, that the transition from strong pain, if it be sudden and abrupt, will not be pleasant.\n\nBut although the pleasures of sense be thus limited, these limits are very different with respect to the different senses. Some of them are soon exhausted, and do not any longer distinguish well the objects that correspond to them; nor are they pleased with those objects which were at first very agreeable, and which they distinguish with sufficient accuracy; whilst others continue to perform their functions longer, and enjoy a more continued pleasure. Thus the senses of smell and of taste are almost immediately satiated; the sense of hearing more slowly; but the sight is in this respect the last of all to be fatigued or satiated: whilst the pleasures that arise from the exercise of our mental faculties are by far the most durable of all. \"Exercise of the mind is as necessary as that of the body to preserve our existence. The senses of other animals, being more quick than ours, are sufficient to direct them to follow what is agreeable to their nature, or to shun whatever is contrary thereto. But we are endowed with reason in order to supply the deficiency of our senses; and pleasure presents herself as an incitement to exercise, in order to keep the mind from a state of hurtful inactivity. Pleasure is not only the parent of sports and amusements, but also of arts and sciences; and as the whole universe is, as it were, forced by our industry to pay tribute to our wants and desires, we cannot but acknowledge our obligation to that law of nature, which has annexed a degree of pleasure to whatever exercises without fatiguing the mind. The pleasure accompanying it is sometimes so great that it transports the very soul, so that she seems as it were disengaged from the body. We know what is recorded in history concerning Archimedes (A), and several other geometricians both ancient and modern. If\n\n(A) When Syracuse was taken by the Romans under Marcellus, Archimedes was in his study, so intent upon some geometrical problems, that he neither heard the clamour of the Romans, nor perceived that the city was taken. In this transport of study and contemplation a soldier came on him with his drawn sword; Archimedes, on seeing him, besought him to hold his hand till he had finished the problem he was about. But the soldier, deaf to his intreaty, ran him through the body, although Marcellus, upon entering the city, had given orders that Archimedes should be spared.\nwe doubt the truths of such facts, we must at least acknowledge their probability, since we meet every day with a number of similar examples. When we see a chess-player so deeply immersed in thought as to be in a manner lost to his outward senses, should we not imagine him to be wholly engrossed with the care of his own private affairs, or of the public weal? but the object of all this profound meditation is the pleasure of exercising the mind by the movement of a piece of ivory. From this exercise of the mind also arises the pleasure we sometimes take in refined and delicate sentiments, which, after the manner of Virgil's shepherdess, (Elysia ad salices, sed se cupit ante videre), are sometimes artfully concealed, but so as to afford us the pleasure of discovering them.\n\nFrom some of the foregoing remarks we also see that nature points out to us the superiority and excellence of our mental faculties, thus suggesting to us that we ought to cultivate them most, as being our better and our nobler part, to the cultivation of which that of our sensitive faculties should be merely subservient. But, although our pleasures are thus by nature rendered in a great degree independent of ourselves, still we have it in our power to make them all more durable, by varying and mixing them with one another, or by interposing between those that are very agreeable others that are less pleasing, so as that no individual pleasure shall be in excess.\n\nBesides the circumstances already noticed, there are others of a very different kind, which have also considerable influence on the pleasures of the senses; such as different conditions of the whole body, particularly of the nerves, or of certain organs or functions, to which functions some organs of sense, and perhaps even the sensation of these, are in a great measure subservient. This is one of the causes why many pleasures, which we cultivate with all our might, cannot be immortal. If a person be thirsty, spring water is nectar to him; if hungry, any kind of food is agreeable, even the smell of food is grateful. To a man in a heat, or in a fever, cold is pleasing; and to one in a cold fit nothing is so agreeable as heat. To these same persons, at other times, so far are these things from being agreeable, that they are often disgusting. The most decided glutton cannot always relish a sumptuous feast.\n\nBesides the sensations excited by external objects, there are others also which cause pain and pleasure. If the action of the muscles be strong, easy, and cheerful, and not continued so as to fatigue us, it causes pleasure. On the contrary, when this action is attended with a sense of little lucubration, difficulty, and debility, it causes pain more or less. In fine, various states and affections of the mind, such as the exercise of memory, imagination, and judgement, nearly for similar reasons, are sometimes painful, at other times agreeable. \"Animi affectus, qui modici graté excitant, vehementes, aut graves et diuturni, hujus pariter ac corporis vires frangunt; hominem interdum statim extinguunt, siem longa valetudine macerant. Somni etiam, quo ad exhaustas vires reficiendas egemus, exceditis, vel defectis, et animo et corpore nocet.\"—Defidia, five animi five corporis, utriique vires languentur: niemia exercitatioe haud minus laeduntur. Statuit enim provida rerum parens, ut fingularum partium, et universi corporis animique vires usu roborentur et acucentur; et huic iterum certos fines posuit: ita ut neque quem voluit natura ulius impune omitteretur, neque ultra modum intendantur.\"\n\nOf such sensations and feelings as are agreeable or disagreeable, we may remark,\" says Dr. Reid, \"that they differ much, not only in degree, but in kind and dignity. Some belong to the animal part of our nature, and are common to us with the brutes; others belong to the rational and moral part. The first are more properly called sensations, the last feelings. The French word sentiment is common to both.\"\n\n\"The Author of nature, in the distribution of agreeable and painful feelings, hath wisely and benevolently consulted the good of the human species; and hath even shewn us, by the same means, what tenor of conduct we ought to hold. For, firstly, The painful sensations of the animal kind are admonitions to avoid what would hurt us; and the agreeable sensations of this kind invite us to those actions that are necessary to the preservation of the individual, or of the kind. Secondly, By the same means nature invites us to moderate bodily exercise, and admonishes us to avoid idleness and inactivity on the one hand, and excessive labour and fatigue upon the other. Thirdly, The moderate exercise of all our rational powers gives pleasure. Fourthly, Every species of beauty is beheld with pleasure, and every species of deformity with disgust; and we shall find all that we call beautiful, to be something estimable, or useful in itself, or a sign of something that is estimable or useful. Fifthly, The benevolent affections are all accompanied with an agreeable feeling, the malevolent with the contrary. And, Sixthly, The highest, the noblest and most durable pleasure is that of doing well and acting the part that becomes us; and the most bitter and painful sentiment is the anguish and remorse of a guilty conscience.\" These observations with regard to the economy of nature in the distribution of our painful and agreeable sensations and feelings are so well illustrated by the elegant and judicious author of Theorie des Sentiments agreeables, that we deem it unnecessary to make any further remarks on this subject. (See Happiness and Pleasure.) A little reflection may satisfy us, that the number and variety of our sensations and feelings are prodigious. For, to omit all those which accompany our appetites, passions, and affections, our moral sentiments and sentiments of taste, even our external senses, furnish a great variety of sensations differing in kind, and almost in every kind an endless variety of degrees. Every variety we discern, with regard to taste, smell, sound, colour, heat, and cold, and in the tangible qualities of bodies, is indicated by a sensation corresponding to it.\n\nThe most general and the most important division of our sensations and feelings is into the agreeable, the disagreeable, and the indifferent. Every thing we call pleasure, happiness, or enjoyment, on the one hand; and, on the other, every thing we call misery, pain, or uneasiness, is sensation or feeling: For no man can for the present be more happy, or more miserable, than he feels himself to be. He cannot be deceived with regard to the enjoyment or suffering of the present moment.\n\nBut, besides the sensations that are agreeable or disagreeable, there is still a greater number that are indifferent. To these we give so little attention, that they have no name, and are immediately forgotten as if they had\nhad never been; it even requires attention to the operations of our minds to be convinced of their existence.\n\nFor this end we may observe, that to a good ear every human voice is distinguishable from all others. Some voices are pleasant, some disagreeable; but the far greater part cannot be said to be one or the other. The same thing may be said of other sounds, and no less of tastes, smells, and colours; and if we consider, that our senses are in continual exercise while we are awake, that some sensation attends every object they present to us, and that familiar objects seldom raise any emotion pleasant or painful; we shall see reason, besides the agreeable and disagreeable, to admit a third class of sensations, that may be called indifferent. But these sensations that are indifferent are far from being useless. They serve as signs to distinguish things that differ; and the information we have concerning things external comes by these means. Thus, if a man had not a musical ear so as to receive pleasure from the harmony or melody of sounds, he would still find the sense of hearing of great utility. Though sounds gave him neither pleasure nor pain, of themselves, they would give him much useful information; and the same may be said of the sensations we have by all the other senses.\n\nSENSIBLE NOTE, in Music, is that which constitutes a third major above the dominant, and a semitone beneath the tonic. Si, or B, is the sensible note in the tone of ut or C sol; or G sharp, in the tone of la or A.\n\nThey call it the sensible note on this account, that it causes to be perceived the tone or natural series of the key and the tonic itself; upon which, after the chord of the dominant, the sensible note taking the shortest road, is under a necessity of rising; which has made some authors treat this sensible note as a major dissonance, for want of observing, that dissonance, being a relation, cannot be constituted unless by two notes between which it subsists.\n\nIt is not meant that the sensible note is the seventh of the tone, because, in the minor mode, this seventh cannot be a sensible note but in ascending; for, in descending, it is at the distance of a full note from the tonic, and of a third minor from the dominant.\n\nSENSIBILITY, is a nice and delicate perception of pleasure or pain, beauty or deformity. It is very nearly allied to taste; and, as far as it is natural, seems to depend upon the organization of the nervous system. It is capable, however, of cultivation, and is experienced in a much higher degree in civilized than in savage nations, and among persons liberally educated than among boors and illiterate mechanics. The man who has cultivated any of the fine arts has a much quicker and more exquisite perception of beauty and deformity in the execution of that art, than another of equal or even greater natural powers, who has but casually inspected its productions. He who has been long accustomed to that decorum of manners which characterizes the polite part of the world, perceives almost instantaneously the smallest deviation from it, and feels himself almost as much hurt by behaviour harmful in itself as by the greatest rudeness; and the man who has long proceeded steadily in the paths of virtue, and often painted to himself the deformity of vice, and the miseries of which it is productive, is more quickly alarmed at any deviation from rectitude, than another who, though his life has been stained by no crime, has yet thought less sensibility upon the principles of virtue and consequences of vice.\n\nEvery thing which can be called sensibility, and is not born with man, may be resolved into affections, and is to be regulated accordingly; for sensibilities may be acquired which are inimical to happiness and to the practice of virtue. The man is not to be envied who has so accustomed himself to the forms of polite address as to be hurt by the unaffected language and manners of the honest peasant, with whom he may have occasion to transact business; nor is he likely to acquire much useful knowledge who has so sedulously studied the beauties of composition as to be unable to read without disgust a book of science or of history, of which the style comes not up to his standard of perfection. That sensibility which we either have from nature, or necessarily acquire, of the miseries of others, is of the greatest use when properly regulated, as it powerfully impels us to relieve their distresses; but if it by any means become so exquisite as to make us shun the sight of misery, it counteracts the end for which it was implanted in our nature, and only deprives us of happiness, while it contributes nothing to the good of others. Indeed there is reason to believe that all such extreme sensibilities are selfish affectations, employed as apologies for withholding from the miserable that relief which it is in our power to give; for there is not a fact better established in the science of human nature, than that passive perceptions grow gradually weaker by repetition, while active habits daily acquire strength.\n\nIt is of great importance to a literary man to cultivate his taste, because, it is the source of much elegant and refined pleasure, (see TASTE); but there is a degree of fatiguingness which renders that pleasure impossible to be obtained, and is the certain indication of expiring letters. It is necessary to submit to the artificial rules of politeness, for they tend to promote the peace and harmony of society, and are sometimes a useful substitute for moral virtue; but he who with respect to them has so much sensibility as to be disgusted with all whose manners are not equally polished with his own, is a very troublesome member of society. It is every man's duty to cultivate his moral sensibilities, so as to make them subservient to the purposes for which they were given to him; but if he either feel, or pretend to feel, the miseries of others to an exquisite degree as to be unable to afford them the relief which they have a right to expect, his sensibilities are of no good tendency.\n\nThat the man of true sensibility has more pains and more pleasures than the callous wretch, is universally admitted, as well as that his enjoyments and sufferings are more exquisite in their kinds; and as no man lives for himself alone, no man will acknowledge his want of sensibility, or express a wish that his heart were callous. It is, however, a matter of some moment to distinguish real sensibilities from ridiculous affectations; those which tend to increase the sum of human happiness from such as have a contrary tendency; and to cultivate them all in such a manner as to make them answer the ends for which they were implanted in us by the benevolent Author of nature. This can be done only by watching over them as over other affections, (see METAPHYSICS, No. 98.) for excessive sensibility, as it is not the gift of nature, is the bane of human happiness. \"Too much tenderness (as Rousseau well observes) proves the bitterest...\"\nSensitive. est curse instead of the most fruitful blessing; vexation and disappointment are its certain consequences. The temperature of the air, the change of the seasons, the brilliancy of the sun, or thickness of the fog, are so many moving springs to the unhappy possessor, and he becomes the wanton sport of their arbitration.\"\n\nSENSITIVE-PLANT. See MIMOSA, DIONÆA, and HEYSARUM, Botany Index\n\nThe sensitive plants are well known to possess a kind of motion, by which the leaves and stalks are contracted and fall down on being slightly touched, or shaken with some degree of violence.\n\nThe contraction of the leaves and branches of the sensitive plant when touched, is a very singular phenomenon. Different hypotheses have been formed by botanists in order to explain it; but we are disposed to believe that these have generally been deduced rather from analogical reasoning than from a collection of facts and observations. We shall therefore give an account of all the important facts which we have been able to collect upon this curious subject; and then draw such conclusions as obviously result from them, without, however, attempting to support any old, or to establish a new, hypothesis.\n\n1. It is difficult to touch the leaf of a healthy sensitive plant so delicately that it will not immediately collapse, the foliola or little leaves moving at their base till they come into contact, and then applying themselves close together. If the leaf be touched with a little more force, the opposite leaf will exhibit the same appearance. If a little more force be applied, the partial footstalks bend down towards the common footstalk from which they issue, making with it a more acute angle than before. If the touch be more violent still, all the leaves situated on the same side with the one that has been touched will instantly collapse, and the partial footstalks will approach the common footstalk to which it is attached, in the same manner as the partial footstalk of the leaf approaches the stem or branch from which it issues; so that the whole plant, from having its branches extended, will immediately appear like a weeping birch.\n\n2. These motions of the plant are performed by means of three distinct and sensible articulations. The first, that of the foliola or lobes to the partial footstalk; the second, that of the partial footstalk to the common one; the third, that of the common footstalk to the trunk. The primary motion of all which is the closing of the leaf upon the partial footstalk, which is performed in a similar manner, and by a similar articulation. This, however, is much less visible than the others. These motions are wholly independent on one another, as may be proved by experiment. It appears that if the partial footstalks are moved, and collapse toward the petiole, or these toward the trunk, the little leaves, whose motion is usually primary to these, should be affected also; yet experiment proves that it is possible to touch the footstalks in such a manner as to affect them only, and make them apply themselves to the trunk, while the leaves feel nothing of the touch; but this cannot be, unless the footstalks are so disposed as that they can fall to the trunk, without suffering their leaves to touch any part of the plant in their passage, because, if they do, they are immediately affected.\n\n3. Winds and heavy rains make the leaves of the sen-\n\nVol. XIX. Part I.\nSensitive touched a third time, descended to 135; and remained in that position till five o'clock in the afternoon, when being touched a fourth time it fell to 110.\n\n9. The parts of the plants which have collapsed afterwards unfold themselves, and return to their former expanded state. The time required for that purpose varies, according to the vigour of the plant, the season of the year, the hour of the day, the state of the atmosphere. Sometimes half an hour is requisite, sometimes only ten minutes. The order in which the parts recover themselves varies in like manner: sometimes it is the common footstalk; sometimes the rib to which the leaves are attached; and sometimes the leaves themselves are expanded, before the other parts have made any attempt to be reinfated in their former position.\n\n10. If, without shaking the other smaller leaves, we cut off the half of a leaf or lob belonging to the last pair, at the extremity or summit of a wing, the leaf cut, and its antagonist, that is to say, the first pair, begin to approach each other; then the second, and so on successively, till all the lesser leaves, or lobes of that wing, have collapsed in like manner. Frequently, after 12 or 15 seconds, the lobes of the other wings, which were not immediately affected by the stroke, flint; whilst the stalk and its wing, beginning at the bottom, and proceeding in order to the top, gradually recover themselves. If, instead of one of the lesser extreme leaves, we cut off one belonging to the pair that is next the footstalk, its antagonist thus, as do the other pairs successively, from the bottom to the top. If all the leaves of one side of a wing be cut off, the opposite leaves are not affected, but remain expanded. With some address, it is possible even to cut off a branch without hurting the leaves, or making them fall. The common footstalk of the winged leaves being cut as far as three-fourths of its diameter, all the parts which hang down collapse, but quickly recover without appearing to have suffered any considerable violence by the shock. An incision being made into one of the principal branches to the depth of one half the diameter, the branches situated betwixt the section and the root will fall down; those above the incision remain as before, and the lesser leaves continue open; but this direction is soon destroyed, by cutting off one of the lobes at the extremity, as was observed above. Lastly, a whole wing being cut off with precaution near its insertion into the common footstalk, the other wings are not affected by it, and its own lobes do not shut. No motion ensues from piercing the branch with a needle or other sharp instrument.\n\n11. If the end of one of the leaves be burned with the flame of a candle, or by a burning glass, or by touching it with hot iron, it closes up in a moment, and the opposite leaf does the same, and after that the whole series of leaves on each side of the partial or little footstalk; then the footstalk itself; then the branch or common footstalk; all do the same, if the burning has been in a sufficient degree. This proves that there is a very nice communication between all the parts of the plant, by means of which the burning, which only is applied to the extremity of one leaf, diffuses its influence through every part of the shrub. If a drop of aquafortis be carefully laid upon a leaf of the sensitive plant, so as not to shake it in the least, the leaf does not begin to move till the acid liquor corrodes the substance of it; but at that time, not only that particular sensitive leaf, but all the leaves placed on the same footstalk, close themselves up. The vapour of burning sulphur has also this effect on many leaves at once, according as they are more or less exposed to it; but a bottle of very acid and sulphurous spirit of vitriol, placed under the branches unlopped, produces no such effect. Wetting the leaves with spirit of wine has been observed also to have no effect, nor the rubbing oil of almonds over them; though this last application destroys many plants.\n\nFrom the preceding experiments the following conclusions may be fairly drawn: 1. The contraction of the parts of the sensitive plant is occasioned by an external force, and the contraction is in proportion to the force. 2. All bodies which can exert any force affect the sensitive plant; some by the touch or by agitation, as the wind, rain, &c.; some by chemical influence, as heat and cold. 3. Touching or agitating the plant produces a greater effect than an incision or cutting off a part, or by applying heat or cold.\n\nAttempts have been made to explain these curious phenomena. Dr Darwin, in the notes to his admired poem, entitled, *The Botanic Garden*, lays it down as a principle, that \"the sleep of animals consists in a suspension of voluntary motion; and as vegetables are subject to sleep as well as animals, there is reason to conclude (says he) that the various action of closing their petals and foliage may be justly ascribed to a voluntary power; for without the faculty of volition sleep would not have been necessary to them.\" Whether this definition of sleep when applied to animals be just, we shall not inquire; but it is evident the supposed analogy between the sleep of animals and the sleep of plants has led Dr Darwin to admit this astonishing conclusion, that plants have volition. As volition presupposes a mind or soul, it were to be wished that he had given us some information concerning the nature of a vegetable soul, which can think and will. We suspect, however, that this vegetable soul will turn out to be a mere mechanical or chemical one; for it is affected by external forces uniformly in the same way, its volition is merely passive, and never makes any successful resistance against those causes by which it is influenced. All this is a mere abuse of words. The sleep of plants is a metaphorical expression, and has not the least resemblance to the sleep of animals. Plants are said to sleep when the flowers or leaves are contracted or folded together; but we never heard that there is any similar contraction in the body of an animal during sleep.\n\nThe fibres of vegetables have been compared with the muscles of animals, and the motions of the sensitive plant have been supposed the same with muscular motion. Between the fibres of vegetables and the muscles of animals, however, there is not the least similarity. If muscles be cut through, so as to be separated from the joints to which they are attached, their powers are completely destroyed; but this is not the case with vegetable fibres. The following very ingenious experiment, which was communicated to us by a respectable member of the University of Edinburgh, is decisive on this subject. He selected a growing poppy at that period of its growth, before unfolding, when the head and neck are bent down almost double. He cut the stalk where it was curved half through on the under side, and half through\nSentence, through at a small distance on the upper side, and half through in the middle point between the two sections, so that the ends of the fibres were separated from the stalks. Notwithstanding these several cuttings on the neck, the poppy raised its head, and assumed a more erect position. There is, therefore, a complete distinction between muscular motion and the motions of a plant, for no motion can take place in the limb of an animal when the muscles of that limb are cut.\n\nIn fine, we look upon all attempts to explain the motions of plants as absurd, and all reasoning from supposed analogy between animals and vegetables as the source of wild conjecture, and not of sound philosophy. We view the contraction and expansion of the sensitive plant in the same light as we do gravitation, chemical attraction, electricity, and magnetism, as a singular fact, the circumstances of which we may be fully acquainted with, but must despair of understanding its cause.\n\nWhat has been said under this article chiefly refers to the mimica fonsitioa and pudica. For a full account of the motions of vegetables in general, see Vegetable Motion, under the article MOTION.\n\nSENTENCE, in Law, a judgement passed in court by the judge in some process, either civil or criminal. See JUDGEMENT.\n\nSENTENCE, in Grammar, denotes a period, or a set of words comprehending some perfect sense or sentiment of the mind. The business of pointing is to distinguish the several parts and members of sentences, so as to render the sense thereof as clear, distinct, and full as possible. See PUNCTUATION.\n\nIn every sentence there are two parts necessarily required; a noun for the subject, and a definite verb: whatever is found more than these two, affects one of them, either immediately, or by the intervention of some other, whereby the first is affected.\n\nAgain, every sentence is either simple or compound: a simple sentence is that consisting of one single subject, and one finite verb.—A compound sentence contains several subjects and finite verbs, either expressly or implicitly.\n\nA simple sentence needs no point or distinction; only a period to close it: as, \"A good man loves virtue for itself.\"—In such a sentence, the several adjuncts affect either the subject or the verb in a different manner. Thus the word good expresses the quality of the subject, virtue the object of the action, and for itself the end thereof.—Now none of these adjuncts can be separated from the rest of the sentence: for if one be, why should not all the rest? and if all be, the sentence will be minced into almost as many parts as there are words.\n\nBut if several adjuncts be attributed in the same manner either to the subject or the verb, the sentence becomes compound, and is to be divided into parts.\n\nIn every compound sentence, as many subjects, or as many finite verbs as there are, either expressly or implied, so many distinctions may there be. Thus, \"My hopes, fears, joys, pains, all centre in you.\" And thus Catilina abit, excelfit, exafit, eruptit.—The reason of which pointing is obvious; for as many subjects or finite verbs as there are in a sentence, so many members does it really contain. Whenever, therefore, there occur more nouns than verbs, or contrariwise, they are to be conceived as equal. Since, as every subject requires its verb, so every verb requires its subject, where with it may agree: excepting, perhaps, in some figurative expressions.\n\nSENTICOSÆ (from sentis, a \"brier or bramble\"); the name of the 35th order in Linnæus's fragments of a natural method, consisting of rose, bramble, and other plants, which resemble them in part and external structure. See BOTANY, Natural Method.\n\nSENTIMENT, according to Lord Kames, is a term appropriated to such thoughts as are prompted by passion. It differs from a perception; for a perception signifies the act by which we become conscious of external objects. It differs from consciousness of an internal action, such as thinking, suspending thought, inclining, revolving, willing, &c. And it differs from the conception of a relation among objects; a conception of that kind being termed opinion.\n\nSENTIMENTS, in Poetry. To talk in the language of music, each passion has a certain tone, to which every sentiment proceeding from it ought to be tuned with the greatest accuracy: which is no easy work, especially where such harmony ought to be supported during the course of a long theatrical representation. In order to reach such delicacy of execution, it is necessary that a writer affix the precise character and passion of the personage represented; which requires an uncommon genius. But it is the only difficulty; for the writer, who annihilating himself, can thus become another person, need be in no pain about the sentiments that belong to the assumed character: these will flow without the least study, or even preconception; and will frequently be as delightfully new to himself as to his reader. But if a lively picture even of a single emotion require an effort of genius, how much greater the effort to compose a passionate dialogue with as many different tones of passion as there are speakers? With what ductility of feeling must that writer be endowed, who approaches perfection in such a work; when it is necessary to affix different and even opposite characters and passions in the quickest succession? Yet this work, difficult as it is, yields to that of composing a dialogue in genteel comedy, exhibiting characters without passion. The reason is, that the different tones of character are more delicate, and less in sight, than those of passion; and, accordingly, many writers, who have no genius for drawing characters, make a shift to represent, tolerably well, an ordinary passion in its simple movements. But of all works of this kind, what is truly the most difficult, is a characteristic dialogue upon any philosophical subject; to interweave characters with reasoning, by suiting to the character of each speaker a peculiarity not only of thought but of expression, requires the perfection of genius, taste, and judgment.\n\nHow difficult dialogue-writing is, will be evident, even without reasoning, from the miserable compositions of that kind found without number in all languages. The art of mimicking any singularity in gesture or in voice, is a rare talent, though directed by sight and hearing; the acutest and most lively of our external senses: how much more rare must that talent, of imitating characters and internal emotions, tracing all their different tints, and representing them in a lively manner by natural sentiments properly expressed? The truth is, such execution is too delicate for an ordinary genius;\nsentiments; and for that reason the bulk of writers, instead of expressing a passion as one does who feels it, content themselves with describing it in the language of a spectator. To awake passion by an internal effort merely, without any external cause, requires great flexibility; and yet that operation is necessary, not less to the writer than to the actor; because none but those who actually feel a passion can represent it to the life. The writer's part is the more complicated: he must add composition to passion; and must, in the quickest succession, adopt every different character. But a very humble flight of imagination may serve to convert a writer into a spectator, so as to figure, in some obscure manner, an action as passing in his sight and hearing. In that figured situation, being led naturally to write like a spectator, he entertains his readers with his own reflections, with cool description, and florid declamation; instead of making them eye-witnesses, as it were, to a real event, and to every movement of genuine passion. Thus most of our plays appear to be cast in the same mould; personages without character, the mere outlines of passion, a tiresome monotony, and a pompous declamatory style.\n\nThis descriptive manner of representing passion is a very cold entertainment; our sympathy is not raised by description; we must first be lulled into a dream of reality, and every thing must appear as passing in our sight. Unhappy is the player of genius who acts a part in what may be termed a descriptive tragedy; after assuming the very passion that is to be represented, how is he cramped in action, when he must utter, not the sentiments of the passion he feels, but a cold description in the language of a bystander? It is that imperfection, undoubtedly, in the bulk of our plays, which confines our stage almost entirely to Shakespeare, notwithstanding his many irregularities. In our late English tragedies, we sometimes find sentiments tolerably well adapted to a plain passion; but we must not in any of them expect a sentiment expressive of character: and, upon that very account, our late performances of the dramatic kind are for the most part intolerably insipid.\n\nBut it may be proper to illustrate this subject by examples. The first examples shall be of sentiments that appear the legitimate offspring of passion; to which shall be opposed what are descriptive only, and illegitimate; and in making this comparison, the instances shall be borrowed from Shakespeare and Corneille, who for genius in dramatic composition stand uppermost in the rolls of fame.\n\nI. Shakespeare shall furnish the first example, being of sentiments dictated by a violent and perturbed passion:\n\nLear. Filial ingratitude!\nIs it not as if this mouth should tear this hand\nFor lifting food to't?—But I'll perish home;\nNo, I will weep no more.—In such a night,\nTo flout me out!—Pour on, I will endure.\nIn such a night as this! O Regan, Gonerill,\nYour old kind father, whose frank heart gave all—\nO! that way madness lies; let me flurn that;\nNo more of that.\n\nKent. Good, my lord, enter here.\nLear. Prithee, go in thyself; seek thine own ease,\n\nThis tempest will not give me leave to ponder\nOn things would hurt me more:—but I'll go in;\nIn, boy, go first. You houseless poverty—\nNay, get thee in; I'll pray, and then I'll sleep—\nPoor naked wretches, where'ere you are,\nThat bide the pelting of this pitiless storm!\nHow shall your houseless heads, and unfed sides,\nYour loopt and window'd raggedness, defend you\nFrom feasons such as these!—O I have ta'en\nToo little care of this! take physic, Pomp;\nExpoze thyself to feel what wretches feel,\nThat thou mayst shake the superflux to them,\nAnd show the heav'ns more just.\n\nKing Lear, act iii. sc. 5.\n\nWith regard to the French author, truth obliges us to acknowledge, that he describes in the style of a spectator, instead of expressing passion like one who feels it; which naturally betrays him into a tiresome monotony, and a pompous declamatory style. It is scarcely necessary to give examples, for he never varies from that tone. We shall, however, take two passages at a venture, in order to be confronted with those transcribed above. In the tragedy of Cinna, after the conspiracy was discovered, Aemilia, having nothing in view but racks and death to herself and her lover, receives a pardon from Augustus, attended with the brightest circumstances of magnanimity and tenderness. This is a lucky situation for representing the passions of surprife and gratitude in their different stages, which seem naturally to be what follow. These passions, raised at once to the utmost pitch, and being at first too big for utterance, must, for some moments, be expressed by violent gestures only: so soon as there is vent for words, the first expressions are broken and interrupted: at last, we ought to expect a tide of intermingled sentiments, occasioned by the fluctuation of the mind between the two passions. Aemilia is made to behave in a very different manner: with extreme coolness she describes her own situation, as if she were merely a spectator; or rather the poet takes the talk off her hands:\n\nEt je me rends, Seigneur, à ces hautes bontés;\nJe recouvre la vue auprès de leurs clartés.\nJe connais mon forfait qui me semblait justice;\nEt ce que n'avoir plus la terreur du supplice,\nJe sens naître en mon ame un repentir puissant,\nEt mon cœur en secret me dit, qu'il y consent.\nLe ciel a réfléti votre grandeur suprême;\nEt pour preuve, Seigneur, je n'en veux que moi-même.\nJ'ose avec vanité me donner cet éclat,\nPuifqu'il change mon cœur, qu'il veut changer l'état.\nMa haine va mourir, que j'ai cru immortelle;\nElle eft morte, et ce cœur devient fujet fidèle;\nEt prenant déformais cette haine en horreur,\nL'ardeur de vous servir succède à la fureur.\n\nAct v. sc. 3.\n\nSo much in general on the genuine sentiments of passion. We proceed to particular observations. And, first, passions seldom continue uniform any considerable time: they generally fluctuate, swelling and subsiding by turns, often in a quick succession; and the sentiments cannot be just unless they correspond to such fluctuation. Accordingly, a climax never shows better than in expressing a dwelling passion: the following passages may suffice for an illustration.\n\nAlmeria.\nAlmeria. — How hast thou charm'd\nThe wildness of the waves and rocks to this;\nThat thus relenting they have given thee back\nTo earth, to light and life, to love and me?\nMourning Bride, act i. sc. 7.\n\nI would not be the villain that thou think'st\nFor the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,\nAnd the rich earth to boot.\nMacbeth, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe following passage expresses finely the progress of conviction.\n\nLet me not stir, nor breathe, lest I dissolve\nThat tender, lovely form, of painted air,\nSo like Almeria. Ha! it sinks, it falls;\nI'll catch it e'er it goes, and grasp her shade.\n'Tis life! 'tis warm! 'tis she! 'tis she herself!\nIt is Almeria! 'tis, it is my wife!\nMourning Bride, act ii. sc. 6.\n\nIn the progress of thought our resolutions become more vigorous as well as our passions.\n\nIf ever I do yield or give consent,\nBy any action, word, or thought, to wed\nAnother lord; may then just heav'n throw't down, &c.\nMourning Bride, act i. sc. 1.\n\nAnd this leads to a second observation, That the different stages of a passion, and its different directions, from birth to extinction, must be carefully represented in their order; because otherwise the sentiments, by being misplaced, will appear forced and unnatural.— Refinement, for example, when provoked by an atrocious injury, discharges itself first upon the author; sentiments therefore of revenge come always first, and must in some measure be exhausted before the person injured think of grieving for himself. In the Cid of Corneille, Don Diego having been affronted in a cruel manner, expresses scarcely any sentiment of revenge, but is totally occupied in contemplating the low situation to which he is reduced by the affront:\n\nO rage! ô déféspoir! ô vieilleffe ennemie!\nN'ai-je donc tant vecu que pour cette infamie?\nEt ne fuis-je blanchi dans les travaux guerriers,\nQue pour voir en un jour fletrir tant de lauriers?\nMon bras, qu'avec respect tout l'Espagne admire,\nMon bras qui tant de fois a sauve cet empire,\nTant de fois affirmé le trône de son roi,\nTrahit donc ma querelle, et ne fait rien pour moi!\nO cruel souvenir de ma gloire passée!\nŒuvre de tant de jours en un jour effacée!\nNouvelle dignité fatale à mon bonheur!\nPrecipice élevé d'où tombe mon honneur!\nFaut-il de votre éclat voir triompher le comte,\nEt mourir sans vengeance, ou vivre dans la honte?\nComte, fois de mon prince à présent gouverneur,\nCe haut rang n'admet point un homme sans honneur;\nEt ton jaloux orgueil par cet affront indigné,\nMalgré le choix du roi, m'en a fait rendre indigne.\nEt toi, de mes exploits glorieux instrument,\nMais d'un corps tout de glace inutile ornement,\nFer jadis tant à enduire, et qui dans cette offense,\nM'as servi de parade, et non pas de défense,\n\nVa, quitte désormais le dernier des humains,\nPasse pour me venger en de meilleures mains.\nLe Cid, act i. sc. 7.\n\nThese sentiments are certainly not the first that are suggested by the passion of resentment. As the first movements of resentment are always directed to its object, the very same is the case of grief. Yet with relation to the sudden and severe distemper that seized Alexander bathing in the river Cydnus, Quintus Curtius describes the first emotions of the army as directed to themselves, lamenting that they were left without a leader, far from home, and had scarce any hopes of returning in safety: their king's distress, which must naturally have been their first concern, occupies them but in the second place according to that author. In the Aminta of Tasso, Sylvia, upon a report of her lover's death, which she believed certain, instead of bemoaning the loss of her beloved, turns her thoughts upon herself, and wonders her heart does not break:\n\nOhime, ben son di fallo,\nPoi che quella novella non m'uccide.\nAct iv. sc. 2.\n\nIn the tragedy of Jane Shore, Alicia, in the full purpose of destroying her rival, has the following reflection:\n\nOh Jealousy! thou bane of pleasing friendship,\nThou worst invader of our tender bosoms;\nHow does thy rancour poison all our loyalties,\nAnd turn our gentle nature into bitterness!\nSee where she comes! Once my heart's dearest blessing,\nNow my chang'd eyes are blasted with her beauty,\nLoathe that known face, and ficken to behold her.\nAct iii. sc. 1.\n\nThese are the reflections of a cool spectator. A passion, while it has the ascendant, and is freely indulged, figments not to the person who feels it any sentiment to its own prejudice: reflections like the foregoing occur not readily till the passion has spent its vigour.\n\nA person sometimes is agitated at once by different passions; and the mind in that case, vibrating like a pendulum, vents itself in sentiments that partake of the same vibration. This we give as a third observation:\n\nQueen. Would I had never trod this English earth,\nOr felt the flatteries that grow upon it!\nYe've angels faces, but heav'n knows your hearts.\nWhat shall become of me now? wretched lady!\nI am the most unhappy woman living.\nAlas! poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?\n[To her women,\nShipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,\nNo friends, no hope, no kindred, weep for me:\nAlmost no grave allow'd me.\nHenry VIII. act iii. sc. 1.\n\nOthello. Oh devil, devil!\nIf that the earth could teem with woman's tears,\nEach drop the falls would prove a crocodile.\nOut of my sight!\nDesdemona. I will not stay t'offend you.\n[Going.\nLodovico. Truly, an obedient lady:\nI do befeech your lordship, call her back.\nOth. Mistres—\nSEN\n\nDef. My lord.\n\nOth. What would you with her, Sir?\n\nLad. Who, I, my lord?\n\nOth. Ay; you did with that I would make her turn,\nSir, she can turn and turn, and yet go on;\nAnd turn again. And she can weep, Sir, weep;\nAnd she's obedient: as you say, obedient:\nVery obedient—proceed you in your tears—\nConcerning this, Sir,—oh well painted passion!—\nI am commanded home—get you away,\nI'll send for you anon—Sir, I obey the mandate,\nAnd will return to Venice.—Hence, avant!\n\n[Exit Desdemona.]\n\nOthello, act iv. sc. 6.\n\nEmilia. Oh! my good lord, I would speak a word\nwith you.\n\nOthello. Yes, 'tis Emilia.—By and by.—She's dead.\n'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death;\nThe noise was high.—Ha! no more moving?\nStill as the grave. Shall the come in? 'wer't good?\nI think she flirs again—No—what's the beft?\nIf she come in, she'll fare, speak to my wife:\nMy wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife;\nOh insupportable! oh heavy hour!\n\nOthello, act v. sc. 7.\n\nA fourth observation is, That nature, which gave us\npassions, and made them extremely beneficial when\nmoderate, intended undoubtedly that they should be sub-\njected to the government of reason and conscience. It\nis therefore against the order of nature, that passion in\nany case should take the lead in contradiction to reason\nand conscience: such a state of mind is a sort of anarchy\nwhich every one is ashamed of and endeavours to hide\nor dissemble. Even love, however laudable, is attended\nwith a conscious shame when it becomes immoderate:\nit is covered from the world, and disclosed only to the\nbeloved object:\n\nEt que l'amour souvent de remors combattu\nParoiffe une foibleffe, et non une vertu.\n\nBoileau, l'Art Poet. chant. iii. l. 101.\n\nO, they love least that let men know they love.\n\nTwo Gentlemen of Verona, act i. sc. 3.\n\nHence a capital rule in the representation of immoderate\npassions, that they ought to be hid or disguised as much\nas possible. And this holds in an especial manner with\nrespect to criminal passions: one never counsels the com-\nmission of a crime in plain terms; guilt must not appear\nin its native colours, even in thought; the proposal must\nbe made by hints, and by representing the action in some\nfavourable light. Of the propriety of sentiment upon\nsuch an occasion, Shakespeare, in the Tempest, has given\nus a beautiful example, in a speech by the usurping duke\nof Milan, advising Sebastian to murder his brother the\nking of Naples:\n\nAntonia. What might,\nWorthy Sebastian.—O, what might—no more.\nAnd yet, methinks, I see it in thy face\nWhat thou shouldest be: the occasion speaks thee, and\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\nDropping upon thy head.\n\nAct ii. sc. 2.\n\nA picture of this kind, perhaps still finer, is exhibited\nin King John, where that tyrant solicits (act iii. sc. 5.) sentiments.\nHubert to murder the young prince Arthur; but it is\ntoo long to be inserted here.\n\nII. As things are best illustrated by their contraries,\nwe proceed to faulty sentiments, disliking to be in-\ndebted for examples to any but the most approved au-\nthors. The first class shall consist of sentiments that ac-\ncord not with the passion; or, in other words, sen-\ntiments that the passion does not naturally suggest. In\nthe second class shall be ranged sentiments that may be-\nlong to an ordinary passion, but unsuitable to it as tac-\ntured by a singular character. Thoughts that properly\nare not sentiments, but rather descriptions, make a third.\nSentiments that belong to the passion repre-\nsented, but are faulty as being introduced too early or\ntoo late, make a fourth. Vicious sentiments exposed\nin their native dress, instead of being concealed or dis-\nguised, make a fifth. And in the last class shall be col-\nlected sentiments suited to no character nor passion, and\ntherefore unnatural.\n\nThe first class contains faulty sentiments of various\nkinds, which we shall endeavour to distinguish from each\nother.\n\n1. Of sentiments that are faulty by being above the\ntone of the passion, the following may serve as an ex-\nample:\n\nOthello. O my soul's joy!\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\nMay the winds blow till they have waken'd death:\nAnd let the labouring bark climb hills of seas\nOlympus high, and duck again as low\nAs hell's from heaven?\n\nOthello, act ii. sc. 6.\n\nThis sentiment may be suggested by violent and in-\nflamed passion; but is not suited to the satisfaction, how-\never great, that one feels upon escaping danger.\n\n2. Influence of sentiments below the tone of the pas-\nsion. Ptolemy, by putting Pompey to death, having\nincurred the displeasure of Caesar, was in the utmost\ndanger of being dethroned: in that agitating situation,\nCorneille makes him utter a speech full of cool reflexion,\nthat is in no degree expressive of the passion.\n\nAh! si je t'avais cru, je n'aurais pas de maître,\nJe serais dans le trône où le ciel m'a fait naître;\nMais c'est une imprudence assez commune aux rois,\nD'écouter trop d'avis, et se tromper au choix.\nLe Délit les aveugle au bord du précipice,\nOu si quelque lumière en leur âme se glisse,\nCette fausse clarté dont il les éblouit,\nLe plonge dans une gouffre, et puis s'évanouit.\n\nLa Mort de Pompée, act iv. sc. 1.\n\n3. Sentiments that agree not with the tone of the\npassion; as where a pleasant sentiment is grafted upon\na painful passion, or the contrary. In the following\ninstances, the sentiments are too gay for a serious pas-\nsion:\n\nNo happier task these faded eyes pursue;\nTo read and weep is all they now can do.\n\nEloïsa to Abelard, l. 47.\n\nAgain;\n\nHeav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,\nSome banish'd lover, or some captive maid:\n\nThey\nThey live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,\nWarm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;\nThe virgin's wish without her fears impart,\nExcuse the blush, and pour out all the heart;\nSpeed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,\nAnd waft a sigh from Indus to the pole.\n\nEloifa to Abelard, l. 51.\n\nThese thoughts are pretty; they suit Pope, but not Eloifa.\n\nSatan, enraged by a threatening of the angel Gabriel, answers thus:\n\nThen when I am thy captive, talk of chains,\nProud militant cherub; but ere then\nFar heavier load thy self expect to feel\nFrom my prevailing arm, though heaven's King\nRide on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,\nUs'd to the yoke, draw'lt his triumphant wheels\nIn progress thro' the road of heav'n far past'd.\n\nParadise Lost, book iv.\n\nThe concluding epithet forms a grand and delightful image, which cannot be the genuine offspring of rage.\n\n4. Sentiments too artificial for a serious passion. The first example is a speech of Percy expiring.\n\nO, Harry, thou hast rob'd me of my growth:\nI better brook the loss of brittle life,\nThan those proud titles thou hast won of me:\nThey wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh.\nBut thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;\nAnd time, that takes survey of all the world,\nMust have a stop.\n\nFirst Part, Henry IV, act v, sc. 9.\n\nThe sentiments of the Mourning Bride are for the most part no less delicate than just copies of nature: in the following exception the picture is beautiful, but too artful to be fuggled by severe grief.\n\nAlmeria. O no! Time gives increase to my afflictions.\n\nThe circling hours, that gather all the woes\nWhich are diffus'd through the revolving year,\nCome heavy laden with th' oppressing weight\nTo me; with me, successively, they leave\nThe sighs, the tears, the groans, the restless cares,\nAnd all the damps of grief, that did retard their flight;\nThey shake their downy wings, and scatter all\nThe dire collected dews on my poor head;\nThen fly with joy and swiftness from me. Act i, sc. 1.\n\nIn the same play, Almeria seeing a dead body, which she took to be Alphonso's, expresses sentiments strained and artificial, which nature fuggles not to any person upon such an occasion:\n\nHad they or hearts or eyes, that did this deed?\nCould eyes endure to guide such cruel hands?\nAre not my eyes guilty alike with theirs,\nThat thus can gaze, and yet not turn to stone?\n—I do not weep! The springs of tears are dry'd,\nAnd of a sudden I am calm, as if\nAll things were well; and yet my husband's murder'd!\n\nYes, yes, I know to mourn: I'll sluice this heart,\nThe source of wo, and let the torrent in.\n\nAct v, sc. ii.\n\nPope's elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady, expresses delicately the most tender concern and sorrow that one can feel for the deplorable fate of a person of worth. Such a poem, deeply serious and pathetic, rejects with disdain all fiction. Upon that account, the following passage deserves no quarter; for it is not the language of the heart, but of the imagination indulging its flights at ease, and by that means is eminently discordant with the subject. It would be a still more severe censure, if it should be ascribed to imitation, copying indifferently what has been said by others:\n\nWhat though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,\nNor polish'd marble emulate thy face?\nWhat though no sacred earth allow thee room,\nNor hallow'd dirge be muttered o'er thy tomb?\nYet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest,\nAnd the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:\nThere shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,\nThere the first roses of the year shall blow;\nWhile angels with their silver wings o'ershade\nThe ground, now sacred by thy relics made.\n\n5. Fanciful or finical sentiments. Sentiments that degenerate into point or conceit, however they may amuse in an idle hour, can never be the offspring of any serious or important passion. In the Jerusalem of Tasso, Tancredi, after a single combat, spent with fatigue and loss of blood, falls into a swoon; in which situation, undisturbed to be dead, he is discovered by Erminia, who was in love with him to distraction. A more happy situation cannot be imagined, to raise grief in an instant to its highest pitch; and yet, in venting her sorrow, she descends most abominably into antithesis and conceit; even of the lowest kind:\n\nE in lui versò d'inefficabil vena\nLacrime, e voce di sospiri mista.\nIn che milero punto hor qui me mena\nFortuna? a che veduta amara e trista?\nDopo gran tempo i' ti ritrovo a pena\nTancredi, e ti riveggio, e non son vilta\nVifta non son da te, benché presente\nI' trovando ti perdo eternamente.\n\nCanto xix, st. 105.\n\nArmida's lamentation respecting her lover Rinaldo is in the same vicious taste. Vid. canto xx, stan. 124, 125, 126.\n\nQueen. Give me no help in lamentation,\nI am not barren to bring forth complaints:\nAll springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,\nThat I, being govern'd by the wat'ry moon,\nMay fend forth plenteous tears to drown the world,\nAh, for my husband, for my dear lord Edward.\n\nKing Richard III, act ii, sc. 2.\n\nJane Shore utters her last breath in a witty conceit:\n\nThen all is well, and I shall sleep in peace—\n'Tis very dark, and I have lost you now—\nWas there not something I would have bequeathed you?\n\nBut\nGuilford to Lady Jane Gray, when both were condemn'd to die:\n\nThou stand'st unmov'd;\nCalm temper fits upon thy beauteous brow;\nThy eyes that flow'd so fast for Edward's loss,\nGaze unconcern'd upon the ruin round thee,\nAs if thou hadst resolve'd to brave thy fate,\nAnd triumph in the midst of defolation.\nHa! see, it swells, the liquid crystal rises,\nIt flarts in spite of thee—but I will catch it,\nNor let the earth be wet with dew so rich.\n\nLady Jane Gray, act iv. near the end.\n\nThe concluding sentiment is altogether finical, unsuitable to the importance of the occasion, and even to the dignity of the passion of love.\n\nCorneille, in his *Examen of the Cid*, answering an objection, That his sentiments are sometimes too much refined for persons in deep distresses, observes, that if poets did not indulge sentiments more ingenious or refined than are prompted by passion, their performances would often be low, and extreme grief would never suggest but exclamations merely. This is in plain language to assert, that forced thoughts are more agreeable than those that are natural, and ought to be preferred.\n\nThe second class is of sentiments that may belong to an ordinary passion, but are not perfectly concordant with it, as tinctured by a singular character.\n\nIn the last act of that excellent comedy *The Careless Husband*, Lady Easy, upon Sir Charles's reformation, is made to express more violent and turbulent sentiments of joy than are consistent with the mildness of her character.\n\nLady Easy. O the soft treasure! O the dear reward of long-deferring love.—Thus! thus to have you mine, is something more than happiness; 'tis double life, and madness of abounding joy.\n\nThe following instances are descriptions rather than sentiments, which compose a third class.\n\nOf this descriptive manner of painting the passions, there is in the *Hippolytus* of Euripides, act v. an illustrious instance, viz. the speech of Theseus, upon hearing of his son's dismal exit. In Racine's tragedy of *Ephèbe*, the queen hearing of the decree issued against her people, instead of expressing sentiments suitable to the occasion, turns her attention upon herself, and describes with accuracy her own situation.\n\nJusse ciel! tout mon sang dans mes veines se glace.\n\nAct i. sc. 3.\n\nAgain,\n\nAman. C'en est fait. Mon orgueil est forcé de plier.\nL'inexorable Amen est réduit à prier.\n\nEphèbe, act iii. sc. 5.\n\nAthalie. Quel prodige nouveau me trouble et m'embarasse?\nLa douceur de sa voix, son enfance, sa grace,\n\nFont insensiblement à mon inimitié\nSuccéder—Je serais sensible à la pitié?\n\nAthalie, act ii. sc. 7.\n\nTitus. O de ma passion fureur désemparée!\nBrutus of Voltaire, act iii. sc. 6.\n\nWhat other are the foregoing instances but describing the passion another feels?\n\nThe fourth class is of sentiments expressed too early or too late.\n\nSome examples mentioned above belong to this class.\n\nAdd the following from *Venice Preserv'd*, act v. at the close of the scene between Belvidera and her father Priuli. The account given by Belvidera of the danger she was in, and of her husband's threatening to murder her, ought naturally to have alarmed her relenting father, and to have made him express the most perturbed sentiments. Instead of which, he dissolves into tenderness and love for his daughter, as if he had already delivered her from danger, and as if there were a perfect tranquillity:\n\nCanst thou forgive me all my follies past!\nI'll henceforth be indeed a father; never,\nNever more thus expose, but cherish thee,\nDear as the vital warmth that feeds my life,\nDear as those eyes that weep in fondness o'er thee:\nPeace to thy heart.\n\nImmoral sentiments exposed in their native colours, instead of being concealed or disguised, compose the fifth class.\n\nThe Lady Macbeth, projecting the death of the king, has the following soliloquy:\n\nThe raven himself's not hoarse\nThat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\nUnder my battlements. Come, all you spirits\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\nAnd fill me from the crown to the toe, top full\nOf direst cruelty; make thick my blood,\nStop up th' access and passage to remorse,\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature\nShake my fell purpose.\n\nMacbeth, act i. sc. 7.\n\nThis speech is not natural. A treacherous murder was never perpetrated even by the most hardened miscreant without compunction; and that the lady here must have been in horrible agitation, appears from her invoking the infernal spirits to fill her with cruelty, and to stop up all avenues to remorse. But in that state of mind it is a never-failing artifice of self-deceit to draw the thickest veil over the wicked action, and to extenuate it by all the circumstances that imagination can suggest: and if the crime cannot bear disguise, the next attempt is to thrust it out of mind altogether, and to rush on to action without thought. This last was the husband's method.\n\nStrange things I have in head, that will to hand;\nWhich must be acted ere they must be feam'd.\n\nAct iii. sc. 5.\n\nThe lady follows neither of these courses, but in a deliberate manner endeavours to fortify her heart in the commission of an execrable crime, without even attempting to colour it. This, we think, is not natural; we hope\nThe first class comprehends sentiments that are unnatural, as being fitted to no character nor passion. These may be subdivided into three branches: first, sentiments unfitting to the constitution of man, and to the laws of his nature; second, inconsistent sentiments; third, sentiments that are pure rant and extravagance.\n\nWhen the fable is of human affairs, every event, every incident, and every circumstance, ought to be natural, otherwise the imitation is imperfect. But an imperfect imitation is a venial fault, compared with that of running cross to nature. In the Hippolytus of Euripides (act iv. sc. 5.), Hippolytus, wishing for another self in his own situation, \"How much (says he) should I be touched with his misfortune?\" as if it were natural to grieve more for the misfortune of another than for one's own.\n\nOsmyn. Yet I behold her—yet—and now no more. Turn your lights inward, eyes, and view my thoughts; So shall you still behold her—'twill not be. O impotence of sight! mechanic sense Which to exterior objects ow'lt thy faculty, Not feeling of election, but necessity. Thus do our eyes, as do all common mirrors, Successively reflect succeeding images. Nor what they would, but must; a star or toad; Just as the hand of chance administers!\n\nMourning Bride, act ii. sc. 8.\n\nNo man in his senses, ever thought of applying his eyes to discover what passes in his mind; far less of blaming his eyes for not seeing a thought or idea. In Molière's Pèruche (act iv. sc. 7.) Harpagon, being robbed of his money, seizes himself by the arm, mistaking it for that of the robber. And again he expresses himself as follow:\n\nJe veux aller querir la justice, et faire donner la question à toute ma maison; à servantes, à valets, à fils, à fille, et à moi aussi.\n\nThis is so absurd as scarcely to provoke a smile, if it be not at the author.\n\nOf the second branch the following example may suffice:\n\nNow bid me run,\nAnd I will strive with things impossible,\nYea, get the better of them.\n\nJulius Cæsar, act ii. sc. 3.\n\nOf the third branch, take the following samples. Lucan, talking of Pompey's sepulchre,\n\nRomanum nomen, et omne\nImperium magno est tumuli modus. Obreue faxa\nCrinimine plena deûm. Si tota est Herculis Oete,\nEt juga tota vacant Bromio Nyfela; quare\nUnus in Egypto Magno lapis? Omnia Lagi\nRura tenere potest, si nullo cefpite nomen\nHæcerit. Erremus populi, cinerumque tuorum,\nMagne, metu nullas Nili calcemus arenas.\n\nLib. viii. l. 798.\n\nThus, in Rowe's translation:\n\nWhere there are seas, or air, or earth, or skies,\nWhere'er Rome's empire stretches, Pompey lies.\n\nVol. XIX. Part I.\n\nFar be the vile memorial then convey'd!\nNor let this flown the partial gods upbraid.\nShall Hercules all Oeta's heights demand,\nAnd Nyfa's hill for Bacchus only stand;\nWhile one poor pebble is the warrior's doom\nThat fought the cause of liberty and Rome?\nIf Fate decrees he must in Egypt lie,\nLet the whole fertile realm his grave supply,\nYield the wide country to his awful shade,\nNor let us dare on any part to tread,\nFearful we violate the mighty dead.\n\nThe following passages are pure rant. Coriolanus, speaking to his mother,\n\nWhat is this?\nYour knees to me? to your corrected son?\nThen let the pebbles on the hungry beach\nFillop the flars: then let the mutinous winds\nStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun:\nMurd'ring impossibility, to make\nWhat cannot be, flight work.\n\nCoriolanus, act i. sc. 3.\n\nCæsar. Danger knows full well,\nThat Cæsar is more dangerous than he.\nWe were two lions litter'd in one day,\nAnd I the elder and more terrible.\n\nJulius Cæsar, act ii. sc. 4.\n\nVentidius. But you, ere love misled your wand'ring eyes,\nWere sure the chief and best of human race,\nFram'd in the very pride and boast of nature,\nSo perfect, that the gods who form'd you wonder'd\nAt their own skill, and cry'd, A lucky hit\nHas mended our design. Dryden, All for Love, act i.\n\nNot to talk of the impiety of this sentiment, it is ludicrous instead of being lofty.\n\nThe famous epitaph on Raphael is not less absurd than any of the foregoing passages:\n\nRaphael, timuit, quo sospite, vinci,\nRerum magna parens, et moriente mori.\n\nImitated by Pope, in his epitaph on Sir Godfrey Kneller:\n\nLiving, great Nature fear'd he might outvie\nHer works; and dying, fears herself may die.\n\nSuch is the force of imitation; for Pope of himself would never have been guilty of a thought so extravagant.\n\nSENTINEL, or Sentry, in military affairs, a private soldier placed in some post to watch the approach of the enemy, to prevent surprizes, to stop such as would pass without orders or discovering who they are. They are placed before the arms of all guards, at the tents and doors of general officers, colonels of regiments, &c.\n\nSENTINEL Perdu, a soldier posted near an enemy, or in some very dangerous post where he is in hazard of being lost.\n\nAll sentinels are to be vigilant on their posts; neither are they to sing, smoke tobacco, nor suffer any noise to be made near them. They are to have a watchful eye over the things committed to their charge. They are not to suffer any light to remain, or any fire to be made,\nmade, near their posts in the night-time; neither is any fentry to be relieved or removed from his post but by the corporal of the guard. They are not to suffer any one to touch or handle their arms, or in the night-time to come within ten yards of their post.\n\nNo person is to strike or abuse a sentry on his post; but when he has committed a crime, he is to be relieved, and then punished according to the rules and articles of war.\n\nA sentinel, on his post in the night, is to know nobody but by the counter-sign: when he challenges, and is answered, Relief, he calls out, Stand, relief! advance, corporal! upon which the corporal halts his men, and advances alone within a yard of the sentry's firelock (first ordering his party to rett, on which the sentry does the same), and gives him the counter-sign, taking care that no one hear it.\n\nSEPIA, the Cuttle-fish, a genus of animals belonging to the class of vermes. See Helminthology Index.\n\nThe officinal cuttle affords the cuttle-bone of the flops, which was formerly used as an absorbent. The bones are frequently flung on all our shores; the animal very rarely. The conger eels, it is said, bite off their arms, or feet; but it is added they grow again, as does the lizard's tail (Plin. ix. 29.). They are preyed upon by the plaffe. This fish emits (in common with the other species), when alarmed or pursued, the black liquor which the ancients supposed darkened the circumambient wave, and concealed it from the enemy.\n\nThe endanger'd cuttle thus evades his fears,\nAnd native hoards of fluid safety bears.\nA pitchy ink peculiar glands supply,\nWhole shades the sharpest beam of light defy.\nPursued, he bids the sable fountains flow,\nAnd, wrapt in clouds, eludes th' impending foe.\nThe fish retreats unseen, while self-born night,\nWith pious shade befriends her parent's flight.\n\nThe ancients sometimes made use of it instead of ink. Persius mentions the species in his description of the noble student.\n\nJam liber, et bicolore positis membranae capillis,\nInque manus chartae, nodisque veient arundo.\nTum querimur, crassius calamo quod pendet humor;\nNigra quod infusa veneat sepia lympha.\n\nAt length, his book he spreads, his pen he takes;\nHis papers here in learned order lays,\nAnd there his parchment's smoother side displays.\nBut oh! what croffes wait on studious men!\nThe cuttle's juice hangs clotted at our pen.\nIn all my life such fluff I never knew,\nSo gummy thick.—D late it, it will do.\nNay, now 'tis water! DRYDEN.\n\nThis animal was esteemed a delicacy by the ancients, and is eaten even at present by the Italians. Rondeletius gives us two receipts for the dressing, which may be continued to this day. Athenaeus also leaves us the method of making an antique cuttle-fish sausage; and we learn from Aristotle, that those animals are in highest esteem when pregnant.\n\nSEPIARIAE, (from seper, \"a hedge\"), the name of the 44th order of Linnaeus's Fragments of a Natural Method, consisting of a beautiful collection of woody plants, some of which, from their size and elegance, are very proper furniture for hedges. See Botany Index.\n\nSEPS, a species of Lacerta. See Herpetology Index.\n\nSEPTARLE, in Natural History, an old term for a variety of ironstone, called also lucas Helmottii. This mineral is of a round compressed form, and is internally divided by septa or thin partitions of lime spar or pyrites; hence the name.\n\nSEPTAS, a genus of plants belonging to the class of Hephaestia; and in the natural system ranged under the 13th order, Succulentae. See Botany Index.\n\nSEPTEMBER, the ninth month of the year, consisting of thirty days; it took its name as being the seventh month, reckoning from March, with which the Romans began their year.\n\nSEPTENNIAL, anything lasting seven years.\n\nSEPTENNIAL Elections. Blackstone, in his Commentaries, vol. i. p. 189, says, (after observing that the utmost extent of time allowed the same parliament to sit by the stat. 6 W. and M. c. 2. was three years), \"But, by the statute 1 Geo. I. st. 2. c. 58. (in order professedly to prevent the great and continued expenses of frequent elections, and the violent heats and animosities consequent thereupon, and for the peace and security of the government, just then recovering from the late rebellion), this term was prolonged to seven years; and what alone is an instance of the vast authority of parliament, the very same house that was chosen for three years enacted its own continuance for seven.\"\n\nSEPTENTRIO, in Astronomy, a constellation, more usually called ura minor.\n\nIn colmography, the term septentrion denotes the same with north; and hence septentrional is applied to anything belonging to the north; as septentrional signs, parallels, &c.\n\nSEPTICS, are those substances which promote putrefaction, chiefly the calcareous earths, magnesia, and teflaceous powders. From the many curious experiments made by Sir John Pringle to ascertain the septic and antiseptic virtues of natural bodies, it appears that there are very few substances of a truly septic nature. Those commonly reputed such by authors, as the alkaline and volatile salts, he found to be no wise septic. However, he discovered some, where it seemed least likely to find any such quality; these were chalk, common salt, and teflaceous powders. He mixed twenty grains of crabs eyes, prepared with six drams of ox's gall, and an equal quantity of water. Into another phial he put an equal quantity of gall and water, but no crabs-eyes. Both these mixtures being placed in the furnace, the putrefaction began much sooner, where the powder was, than in the other phial. On making a like experiment with chalk, its septic virtue was found to be much greater than that of the crabs-eyes: nay, what the doctor never met with before, in a mixture of two drams of flesh, with two ounces of water and thirty grains of prepared chalk, the flesh was resolved into a perfect mucus in a few days.\n\nTo try whether the teflaceous powders would also dissolve vegetable substances, the doctor mixed them with barley and water, and compared this mixture with another of barley and water alone. After a long maceration\nceration by a fire, the plain water was found to swell the barley, and turn mucilaginous and sour; but that with the powder kept the grain to its natural size, and though it softened it, yet made no mucilage, and remained sweet.\n\nNothing could be more unexpected, than to find sea salt a halterer of putrefaction; but the fact is thus; one dram of salt preserves two drams of fresh beef in two ounces of water, above thirty hours, uncorrupted, in a heat equal to that of the human body; or, which is the same thing, this quantity of salt keeps flesh sweet twenty hours longer than pure water; but then half a dram of salt does not preserve it above two hours longer. Twenty-five grains have little or no antiseptic virtue, and ten, fifteen, or even twenty grains, manifestly both hasten and heighten the corruption. The quantity which had the most putrefying quality, was found to be about ten grains to the above proportion of flesh and water.\n\nMany inferences might be drawn from this experiment: one is, that since salt is never taken in aliment beyond the proportion of the corrupting quantities, it would appear that it is subservient to digestion chiefly by its septic virtue, that is, by softening and resolving meats; an action very different from what is commonly believed.\n\nIt is to be observed, that the above experiments were made with the salt kept for domestic uses. See Pringle's Observ, on the Diseases of the army, p. 348, et seq.\n\nSEPTIZON, or SEPTIZONIUM, in Roman antiquity, a celebrated mausoleum, built by Septimius Severus, in the tenth region of the city of Rome: it was so called from septem and zona, by reason it consisted of seven stories, each of which was surrounded by a row of columns.\n\nSEPTUAGESIMA, in the calendar, denotes the third Sunday before Lent, or before Quadragesima Sunday: supposed by some to take its name from its being about seventy days before Easter.\n\nSEPTUAGINT, the name given to a Greek version of the books of the Old Testament, from its being supposed to be the work of seventy Jews, who are usually called the seventy interpreters, because seventy is a round number.\n\nThe history of this version is expressly written by Ariasias, an officer of the guards to Ptolemy Philadelphus, the substance of whose account is as follows:—Ptolemy having erected a fine library at Alexandria, which he took care to fill with the most curious and valuable books from all parts of the world, was informed that the Jews had one containing the laws of Moses, and the history of that people; and being desirous of enriching his library with a Greek translation of it, applied to the high-priest of the Jews; and to engage him to comply with his request, set at liberty all the Jews whom his father Ptolemy Soter had reduced to slavery. After such a step, he easily obtained what he desired; Eleazar the Jewish high-priest sent back his ambassadors with an exact copy of the Mosaic law, written in letters of gold, and five elders of each tribe, in all seventy-two; who were received with marks of respect by the king, and then conducted into the isle of Pharos, where they were lodged in a house prepared for their reception, and supplied with every thing necessary. They set about the translation without loss of time, and finished it in seventy-two days; and the whole being read in the presence of the king, he admired the profound wisdom of the laws of Moses: and sent back the deputies laden with presents, for themselves, the high-priest, and the temple.\n\nAristobulus, who was tutor to Ptolemy Physicon, Philo who lived in our Saviour's time, and was contemporary with the apostles, and Josephus, speak of this translation as made by seventy-two interpreters, by the care of Demetrius Phalereus in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus. All the Christian writers, during the first centuries of the Christian era, have admitted this account of the Septuagint as an undoubted fact. But since the reformation, critics have boldly called it in question, because it was attended with circumstances which they think inconsistent, or, at least, improbable. Du Pin has asked, why were seventy-two interpreters employed, since twelve would have been sufficient? Such an objection is trifling. We may as well ask, why did King James I employ fifty-four translators in rendering the Bible into English, since Du Pin thinks twelve would have been sufficient?\n\n1. Prideaux objects, that the Septuagint is not written in the Jewish, but in the Alexandrian dialect; and could not therefore be the work of natives of Palestine. But these dialects were probably at that time the same, for both Jews and Alexandrians had received the Greek language from the Macedonians about 50 years before.\n\n2. Prideaux farther contends, that all the books of the Old Testament could not be translated at the same time; for they exhibit great difference of style. To this it is sufficient to reply, that they were the work of seventy-two men, each of whom had separate portions assigned them.\n\n3. The Dean also urges, that Ariasias, Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus, all distinctly tell us, that the law was translated without mentioning any of the other sacred books. But nothing was more common among writers of the Jewish nation than to give this name to the Scriptures as a whole. In the New Testament, law is used as synonymous with what we call the Old Testament. Besides, it is expressly said by Aristobulus, in a fragment quoted by Eusebius (Prep. Evian. l. i.), that the whole Sacred Scripture was rightly translated through the means of Demetrius Phalereus, and by the command of Philadelphus. Josephus indeed, says the learned Dean, asserts, in the preface to his Antiquities, that the Jewish interpreters did not translate for Ptolemy the whole Scriptures, but the law only. Here the evidence is contradictory, and we have to determine, whether Aristobulus or Josephus be most worthy of credit. We do not mean, however, to accuse either of forgery, but only to inquire which had the best opportunities of knowing the truth. Aristobulus was an Alexandrian Jew, tutor to an Egyptian king, and lived within 100 years after the translation was made, and certainly had access to see it in the royal library. Josephus was a native of Palestine, and lived not until 300 years or more after the translation was made, and many years after it was burnt along with the whole library of Alexandria in the wars of Julius Caesar. Supposing the veracity of these two writers equal, as we have no proof of the contrary, which of them ought we to consider as the best evidence? Aris-\nSeptuagint. Aristeus surely. Prideaux, indeed, seems doubtful whether there was ever such a man; and Dr Hody supposes that the Commentaries on the five books of Moses, which bear the name of Aristobulus, were a forgery of the second century. To prove the existence of any human being, who lived 2000 years before us, and did not perform such works as no mere man ever performed, is a task which we are not disposed to undertake; and we believe it would not be less difficult to prove that Philo and Josephus existed, than that such a person as Aristobulus did not exist. If the writings which have passed under his name were a forgery of the second century, it is surprising that they should have imposed upon Clemens Alexandrinus, who lived in the same century, and was a man of abilities, learning, and well acquainted with the writings of the ancients. Eusebius, too, in his Prep. Evan., quotes the Commentaries of Aristobulus. But, continues the learned Dean, \"Clemens Alexandrinus is the first author that mentions them. Now, had any such commentaries existed in the time of Philo and Josephus, they would surely have mentioned them. But is the circumstance of its not being quoted by every succeeding author a sufficient reason to disprove the authenticity of any book? Neither Philo nor Josephus undertook to give a list of preceding authors, and it was by no means the uniform practice of these times always to name the authors from whom they derived their information.\"\n\n4. Prideaux farther contends, that the sum which Ptolemy is said to have given to the interpreters is too great to be credible. If his computation were just, it certainly would be so. He makes it 2,000,000 sterling, but other writers reduce it to 85,421l. and some to 56,947l.; neither of which is a sum to very extraordinary in so great and magnificent a prince as Philadelphia, who spent, according to a paflage in Athenaeus (lib. v.), not less than 10,000 talents on the furniture of one tent; which is five times more than what was spent in the whole of the embassy and translation, which amounted only to 1,552 talents.\n\n5. Prideaux says, \"that what convicts the whole story of Aristeas of falsity is, that he makes Demetrius Phalereus to be the chief actor in it, and a great favourite of the king; whereas Philadelphia, as soon as his father was dead, cast him into prison, where he soon after died.\" But it may be replied, that Philadelphia reigned two years jointly with his father Lagus, and it is not said by Hermippus that Demetrius was out of favour with Philadelphia during his father's life. Now, if the Septuagint was translated in the beginning of the reign of Philadelphia, as Eusebius and Jerome think, the difficulty will be removed. Demetrius might have been librarian during the reign of Philadelphia, and yet imprisoned on the death of Lagus. Indeed, as the cause of Philadelphia's displeasure was the advice which Demetrius gave to his father, to prefer the sons of Arsinoë before the son of Bernice, he could scarcely show it till his father's death. The Septuagint translation might therefore be begun while Philadelphia reigned jointly with his father, but not be finished till after his father's death.\n\n6. Besides the objections which have been considered, there is only one that deserves notice. The ancient Christians not only differ from one another concerning the time in which Aristobulus lived, but even contradict themselves in different parts of their work. Sometimes they tell us, he dedicated his book to Ptolemy Philometer, at other times they say, it was addressed to Philadelphia and his father. Sometimes they make him the same person who is mentioned in 2 Maccabees, chap. i. and sometimes one of the 72 interpreters 152 years before. It is difficult to explain how authors fall into such inconsistencies, but it is probably occasioned by their quoting from memory. This was certainly the practice of almost all the early Christian writers, and sometimes of the apostles themselves. Mistakes were therefore inevitable. Josephus has varied in the circumstances of the same event, in his antiquities and wars of the Jews, probably from the same cause; but we do not hence conclude, that every circumstance of such a relation is entirely false. In the account of the Marquis of Argyle's death in the reign of Charles II, we have a very remarkable contradiction, Lord Clarendon relates, that he was condemned to be hanged, which was performed the same day: on the contrary, Burnet, Woodrow, Heath, Echard, concur in stating, that he was beheaded; and that he was condemned upon the Saturday and executed upon the Monday†. Was any reader of English history ever sceptic enough to raise Britain from hence a question, whether the Marquis of Argyle was executed or not? Yet this ought to be left in uncertainty according to the way of reasoning in which the facts reflecting the translation of the Septuagint is attempted to be disproved.\n\nSuch are the objections which the learned and ingenious Prideaux has raised against the common account of the Septuagint translation, and such are the answers which may be given to them. We have chosen to support that opinion which is sanctioned by historical evidence, in preference to the conjectures of modern critics however ingenious; being persuaded, that there are many things recorded in history, which, though perfectly true, yet, from our imperfect knowledge of the concomitant circumstances, may, at a distant period, seem liable to objections. To those who require positive evidence, it may be stated thus. Aristeas, Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus, assure us, that the law was translated. Taking the law in the most restricted sense, we have at least sufficient authority to assert, that the Pentateuch was rendered into Greek under Ptolemy Philadelphia. Aristobulus affirms, that the whole Scriptures were translated by the seventy-two. Josephus confines their labours to the books of Moses. He therefore who cannot determine to which of the two the greatest respect is due, may suspend his opinion. It is certain, however, that many of the other books were translated before the age of our Saviour; for they are quoted both by him and his apostles: and, perhaps, by a minute examination of ancient authors, in the same way that Dr Lardner has examined the Christian fathers to prove the antiquity of the New Testament, the precise period in which the whole books of the Septuagint were composed might, with considerable accuracy, be ascertained.\n\nFor 400 years this translation was in high estimation with the Jews. It was read in their synagogues in preference to the Hebrew; not only in those places where Greek was the common language, but in many synagogues of Jerusalem and Judea. But when they saw that it was equally valued by the Christians, they became...\nSeptuagint came jealous of it; and at length, in the second century, Aquila, an apostle Christian, attempted to substitute another Greek translation in its place. In this work he was careful to give the ancient prophecies concerning the Messiah a different turn from the Septuagint, that they might not be applicable to Christ. In the same design he was followed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who also, as St Jerome informs us, wrote out of hatred to Christianity.\n\nIn the mean time, the Septuagint, from the ignorance, boldness, and carelessness of transcribers, became full of errors. To correct these, Origen published a new edition in the beginning of the third century, in which he placed the translations of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. This edition was called Tetrapla, the translations being arranged opposite to one another in four columns. He also added one column, containing the Hebrew text in Hebrew letters; and another exhibiting it in Greek. In a second edition he published two additional Greek versions; one of which was found at Nicopolis, and the other at Jericho; this was called the Hexapla. By comparing so many translations, Origen endeavoured to form a correct copy of the Scriptures. Where they all agreed, he considered them right. The passages which he found in the LXX, but not in the Hebrew text, he marked with an obelisk; what he found in the Hebrew, but not in the LXX, he marked with an asterisk. St Jerome says, that the additions which Origen made to the LXX, and marked with an asterisk, were taken from Theodotion. From this valuable work of Origen the version of the LXX was transcribed in a separate volume, with the asterisks and obelisks for the use of the churches; and from this circumstance the great work itself was neglected and lost.\n\nAbout the year 300 two new editions of the LXX were published; the one by Hesychius an Egyptian bishop, and the other by Lucian a prebyter of Antioch. But as these authors did not mark with any note of distinction the alterations which they had made, their edition does not possess the advantages of Origen's.\n\nThe best edition of the LXX is that of Dr Grabe, which was published in the beginning of the present century. He had access to two MSS, nearly of equal antiquity, the one found in the Vatican library at Rome, the other in the royal library at St James's, which was presented to Charles I. by Cyril, patriarch of Alexandria, and hence is commonly called the Alexandrian MS. Anxious to discover which of these was according to the edition of Origen, Dr Grabe collected the fragments of the Hexapla, and found they agreed with the Alexandrian MS. but not with the Vatican where it differed with the other. Hence he concluded that the Alexandrian MS. was taken from the edition of Origen. By comparing the quotations from scripture in the works of Athanasius and St Cyril (who were patriarchs of Alexandria at the time St Jerome says Hesychius's edition of the LXX was translated) with the Vatican MS. he found they agreed to well that he justly inferred that that MS. was taken from the edition of Hesychius.\n\nThis version was in use to the time of our blest Saviour, and is that out of which most of the citations in the New Testament, from the Old, are taken. It was also the ordinary and canonical translation made use of by the Christian church in the earliest ages; and it still subsists in the churches both of the east and west.\n\nThose who desire a more particular account of the Septuagint translations may consult Hody de Bibliorum Textibus, Prideaux's Connections, Owen's Inquiry into the Septuagint Version, Blair's Lectures on the Canon, and Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament, last edition.\n\nSEPTUAGINT Chronology, the chronology which is formed from the dates and periods of time mentioned in the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament. It reckons 1500 years more from the creation to Abraham than the Hebrew bible. Dr Kennicott, in the dissertation prefixed to his Hebrew bible, has shown it to be very probable that the chronology of the Hebrew scriptures, since the period just mentioned, was corrupted by the Jews, between the years 175 and 200, and that the chronology of the Septuagint is more agreeable to truth. It is a fact, that during the second and third centuries the Hebrew scriptures were almost entirely in the hands of the Jews, while the Septuagint was confined to the Christians. The Jews had therefore a very favourable opportunity for this corruption. The following is the reason which is given by oriental writers: It being a very ancient tradition, that the Messiah was to come in the sixth chiliad, because he was to come in the last days (founded on a mythical application of the six days creation), the contrivance was to shorten the age of the world from about 5500 to 3760; and thence to prove that Jesus could not be the Messiah. Dr Kennicott adds, that some Hebrew copies having the larger chronology were extant till the time of Eusebius, and some till the year 700.\n\nSEPTUM, in Anatomy, an inclosure or partition; a term applied to several parts of the body, which serve to separate one part from another; as, septum narium, or partition between the nostrils, &c.\n\nSEPULCHRAL, something belonging to sepulchres or tombs: thus a sepulchral column is a column erected over a tomb, with an inscription on its shaft; and sepulchral lamps, those said to have been found burning in the tombs of several martyrs and others. See Lamp.\n\nSEPULCHRE, a tomb or place destined for the interment of the dead. This term is chiefly used in speaking of the burying-places of the ancients, those of the moderns being usually called tombs.\n\nSepulchres were held sacred and inviolable; and the care taken of them has always been held a religious duty, grounded on the fear of God, and the belief of the soul's immortality. Those who have searched or violated them have been thought odious by all nations, and were always severely punished.\n\nThe Egyptians called sepulchres eternal houses, in contradiction to their ordinary houses or palaces, which they called mans, on account of their short stay in the one in comparison of their long abode in the other. See Tomb.\n\nRegular Canons of St SEPULCHRE, a religious order, formerly instituted at Jerusalem, in honour of the holy sepulchre, or the tomb of Jesus Christ.\n\nMany of these canons were brought from the Holy Land into Europe, particularly into France, by Louis the Younger; into Poland, by Jaxa, a Polish gentleman; and into Flanders, by the counts thereof; many\nSepulchre also came into England. This order was, however, sup-\nprest by Pope Innocent VIII. who gave its revenues\nand effects to that of our Lady of Bethlehem: which\nalso becoming extinct, they were bestowed on the knights\nof St John of Jerusalem. But the suppression did not\ntake effect in Poland, where they still subsist, as also in\nseveral provinces of Germany. These canons follow the\nrule of St Augustine.\n\nKnights of the Holy Sepulchre, a military order,\nestablished in Palestine about the year 1114.\n\nThe knights of this order in Flanders chose Phi-\nlip II. king of Spain, for their master, in 1558, and\nafterwards his son; but the grand master of the order\nof Malta prevailed on the last to resign; and, when\nafterwards the duke of Nevers assumed the same qua-\nlity in France, the same grand-master, by his interest\nand credit, procured a like renunciation of him, and\na confirmation of the union of this order to that of\nMalta.\n\nSEQUANI, a people anciently forming a part of\nGallia Celtica, but annexed to Belgica by Augustus,\nseparated from the Helvetii by Mount Jura, with the\nRhine on the east (Strabo), bordering on the Aedui\nand Segugianos to the south, and Lingones to the west\n(Tacitus). Now Franche Comte.\n\nSEQUESTRATION, in Common Law, is setting\naside the thing in controversy from the possession of\nboth the parties that contend for it. In which sense\nit is either voluntary, as when done by the consent of\nthe parties; or necessary, as where it is done by the\njudge, of his own authority, whether the parties will or\nnot.\n\nSEQUESTRATION, in the Civil Law, is the act of\nthe ordinary, disposing of the goods and chattels of one de-\nceased, whose estate no man will meddle with.\n\nA widow is also said to sequester, when she disclaims\nhaving any thing to do with the estate of her deceased\nhusband.\n\nAmong the Romanists, in questions of marriage, where\nthe wife complains of impotency in the husband, she is to\nbe sequestrated into a convent, or into the hands of ma-\ntrons, till the process be determined.\n\nSEQUESTRATION is also used for the act of gathering\nthe fruits of a benefice void, to the use of the next incum-\nbent.\n\nSometimes a benefice is kept under sequestration for\nmany years, when it is of so small value, that no clerg-\nyman fit to serve the cure will be at the charge of ta-\nking it by institution; in which case the sequestration is\ncommitted either to the curate alone, or to the curate and\nchurch-wardens jointly. Sometimes the profits of a liv-\ning in controversy, either by the consent of the parties,\nor the judge's authority, are sequestrated and placed for\nsafety in a third hand, till the suit is determined, a mi-\nnister being appointed by the judge to serve the cure,\nand allowed a certain salary out of the profits. Some-\ntimes the profits of a living are sequestrated for neglect of\nduty, for dilapidations, or for satisfying the debts of the\nincumbent.\n\nSEQUESTRATION, in chancery, is a commission usually\ndirected to seven persons therein named, empowering\nthem to seize the defendant's personal estate, and the pro-\nfits of his real, and to detain them, subject to the order\nof the court. It issues on the return of the sergeant at\narms, wherein it is certified, that the defendant had se-\nquestered himself.\n\nSequestrations were first introduced by Sir Nicholas\nBacon, lord keeper in the reign of Queen Elizabeth;\nbefore which the court found some difficulty in enfor-\ncing its process and decrees; and they do not seem to be\nin the nature of process to bring in the defendant, but\nonly intended to enforce the performance of the court's\ndecree.\n\nA sequestration is also made, in London, upon an\naction of debt; the course of proceeding in which case\nis this: The action being entered, the officer goes to\nthe defendant's shop or warehouse, when no person is\nthere, and takes a padlock, and hangs it on the door,\nuttering these words: \"I do sequester this warehouse,\nand the goods and merchandise therein, of the defend-\nant in this action, to the use of the plaintiff,\" &c., after\nwhich he sets on his seal, and makes a return of the se-\nquestration in the compter; and four days being passed\nafter the return made, the plaintiff may, at the next\ncourt, have judgment to open the shop or warehouse,\nand to have the goods appraised by two freemen, who\nare to be sworn at the next court held for that com-\nputer; and then the sergeant puts his hand to the bill of\nappraisement, and the court grants judgment thereon;\nbut yet the defendant may put in bail before satisfac-\ntion, and by that means dissolve the sequestration; and\nafter satisfaction, may put in bail to disprove the debt,\n&c.\n\nIn the time of the civil wars, sequestration was used\nfor a seizing of the estates of delinquents for the use of\nthe commonwealth.\n\nSEQUESTRATION, in Scots Law. See LAW Index.\n\nSEQUIN, a gold coin, struck at Venice, and in\nseveral parts of the Grand Signior's dominions. In\nTurkey, it is called dallob, or piece of gold, and ac-\ncording to Volney is in value about 6s. 3d. sterling.\nIt varies, however, considerably in its value in different\ncountries. At Venice it is equal to about 9s. 2d. ster-\nling.\n\nThe Venetian sequins are in great request in Syria,\nfrom the fineness of their standard, and the practice\nthey have of employing them for women's trinkets.\nThe fashion of these trinkets does not require much art;\nthe piece of gold is simply pierced, in order to suspend\nit by a chain, likewise of gold, which flows upon the\nbreast. The more sequins that are attached to this\nchain, and the greater the number of these chains, the\nmore is a woman thought to be ornamented. This is\nthe favourite luxury, and the emulation of all ranks.\nEven the female peasants, for want of gold, wear\npiastres or smaller pieces; but the women of a certain\nrank disdain these; they will accept of nothing but se-\nquins of Venice, or large Spanish pieces, and cruzados.\nSome of them wear 260 or 300, as well lying flat, as\nhanging one on another, and hang near the forehead, at\nthe edge of the head dress. It is a real load; but they\ndo not think they can pay too dearly for the satis-\nfaction of exhibiting this treasure at the public bath, be-\nfore a crowd of rivals, to awaken whose jealousy consti-\ntutes their chief pleasure. The effect of this luxury on\ncommerce, is the withdrawing considerable sums from\ncirculation, which remain dead; besides, that when any\nof these pieces return into common use, having lost\ntheir weight by being pierced, it becomes necessary to weigh them. The practice of weighing money is general in Syria, Egypt, and all Turkey. No piece, however effaced, is refused there; the merchant draws out his scales and weighs it, as in the days of Abraham, when he purchased his sepulchre. In considerable payments, an agent of exchange is sent for, who counts paras by thousands, rejects a great many pieces of false money, and weighs all the lemons, either separately or together.\n\nSERAGLIO, formed from the Persian word seraw, or Turkish word sarai, which signifies a house, and is commonly used to express the house or palace of a prince. In this sense it is frequently used at Constantinople; the houses of foreign ambassadors are called seraglions. But it is commonly used by way of eminence for the palace of the grand signior at Constantinople, where he keeps his court, and where his concubines are lodged, and where the youth are trained up for the chief posts of the empire.\n\nIt is a triangle about three Italian miles round, wholly within the city, at the end of the promontory Chryseae, now called the Seraglio Point. The buildings run back to the top of the hill, and from thence are gardens that reach to the edge of the sea. It is inclosed with a very high and strong wall, upon which there are several watch-towers; and it has many gates, some of which open towards the sea-side, and the rest into the city; but the chief gate is one of the latter, which is constantly guarded by a company of capochees, or porters; and in the night it is well guarded towards the sea. The outward appearance is not very beautiful, the architecture being irregular, consisting of separate edifices in the form of pavilions and domes.\n\nThe ladies of the seraglio are a collection of beautiful young women, chiefly sent as presents from the provinces and the Greek islands, most of them the children of Christian parents. The brave prince Heraclius hath for some years past abolished the infamous tribute of children of both sexes, which Georgia formerly paid every year to the Porte. The number of women in the harem depends on the taste of the reigning monarch or sultan. Selim had 2000, Achmet had but 300, and his successor had nearly 1600. On their admission they are committed to the care of old ladies, taught sewing and embroidery, music, dancing, and other accomplishments, and furnished with the richest clothes and ornaments. They all sleep in separate beds, and between every fifth there is a preceptress. Their chief governess is called Kato Kinga, or governess of the noble young ladies. There is not one servant among them, for they are obliged to wait on one another by rotation; the last that is entered serves her who preceded her and herself. These ladies are scarcely ever suffered to go abroad, except when the grand signior removes from one place to another, when a troop of black eunuchs convey them to the boats, which are inclosed with lattices and linen curtains; and when they go by land they are put into close chariots, and signals are made at certain distances, to give notice that none approach the roads through which they march. The boats of the harem, which carry the grand signior's wives, are manned with 24 rowers, and have white covered tilts, shut alternately by Venetian blinds. Among the emperor's attendants are a number of mates, who act and converse by signs with great quickness, and some dwarfs, who are exhibited for the diversion of his Majesty.\n\nWhen he permits the women to walk in the gardens of the seraglio, all people are ordered to retire, and on every side there is a guard of black eunuchs, with fables in their hands, while others go their rounds in order to hinder any person from seeing them. If, unfortunately, any one is found in the garden, even through ignorance or inadvertence, he is undoubtedly killed, and his head brought to the feet of the grand signior, who gives a great reward to the guard for their vigilance. Sometimes the grand signior passes into the gardens to amuse himself when the women are there; and it is then that they make use of their utmost efforts, by dancing, singing, seducing gestures, and amorous blandishments, to inflame the affections of the monarch. It is not permitted that the monarch should take a virgin to his bed, except during the solemn festivals, and on occasion of some extraordinary rejoicings, or the arrival of some good news. Upon such occasions, if the sultan choose a new companion to his bed, he enters into the apartment of the women, who are ranged in files by the governesses, to whom he speaks, and intimates the person he likes best: the ceremony of the handkerchief, which the grand signior is said to throw to the girl that he elects, is an idle tale, without any foundation. As soon as the grand signior has chosen the girl that he has destined to be the partner of his bed, all the others follow her to the bath, washing and perfuming her, and dressing her superbly, conducting her singing, dancing, and rejoicing, to the bed-chamber of the grand signior, who is generally, on such an occasion, already in bed. Scarcely has the new-elected favourite entered the chamber, introduced by the grand eunuch who is upon guard, than she kneels down, and when the sultan calls her, she creeps into bed to him by the foot of the bed, if the sultan does not order her, by special grace, to approach by the side: after a certain time, upon a signal given by the sultan, the governess of the girls, with all her suite, enters the apartment, and takes her back again, conducting her with the same ceremony to the women's apartments; and if by good fortune she becomes pregnant, and is delivered of a boy, she is called ajabi fulanef, that is to say, sultan's mother; for the first son she has the honour to be crowned, and she has the liberty of forming her court. Eunuchs are also assigned for her guard, and for her particular service. No other ladies, though delivered of boys, are either crowned or maintained with such costly distinction as the first; however, they have their service apart, and handsome appointments. After the death of the sultan, the mothers of the male children are shut up in the old seraglio, from whence they can never come out any more, unless any of their sons ascend the throne. Baron de Tott informs us, that the female slave who becomes the mother of a sultan, and lives long enough to see her son mount the throne, is the only woman who at that period alone acquires the distinction of sultan's mother; she is still then in the interior of her prison with her son. The title of bache kadim, principal woman, is the first dignity of the grand signior's harem; and she has a larger allowance.\nallowance than those who have the title of second, third, and fourth woman, which are the four free women the Koran allows.\n\nThis is a description of the grand signior's seraglio; we shall now add an account of the seraglio or harem, as it is often called, of the emperor of Morocco, from the very interesting tour of Mr Lempriere. This gentleman being a surgeon by profession, was admitted into the harem to prescribe for some of the ladies who were indisposed, and was therefore enabled to give a particular account of this female prison, and what is still more curious, of the manners and behaviour of its inhabitants.\n\nThe harem forms a part of the palace. The apartments, which are all on the ground floor, are square, very lofty, and four of them inclose a spacious square court, into which they open by means of large folding doors. In the centre of these courts, which are floored with blue and white chequered tiling, is a fountain, supplied by pipes from a large reservoir on the outside of the palace, which serves for the frequent ablutions recommended by the Mahometan religion, as well as for other purposes. The whole of the harem consists of about twelve of these square courts, communicating with each other by narrow passages, which afford a free access from one part of it to another, and of which all the women are allowed to avail themselves.\n\nThe apartments are ornamented on the outside with beautiful carved wood. In the inside most of the rooms are hung with rich damask of various colours; the floors are covered with beautiful carpets, and there are matresses disposed at different distances, for the purposes of fitting and sleeping.\n\nBesides these, the apartments are furnished at each extremity with an elegant European mahogany bedstead, hung with damask, having on it several matresses placed one over the other, which are covered with various coloured silks; but these beds are merely placed there to ornament the room. In all the apartments, without exception, the ceiling is wood, carved and painted. The principal ornaments in some were large and valuable looking-glasses, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different sizes, in glass cases, were disposed in the same manner.\n\nThe sultana Lalla Batoom and another favourite were indulged with a whole square to themselves; but the concubines were only each allowed a single room.\n\nEach female had a separate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the estimation in which they were held by him. The late emperor's allowance was very trifling: Lalla Douyauw, the favourite sultana, had very little more than half-a-crown English a-day, and the others less in proportion. It must be allowed, that the emperor made them occasional presents of money, drefs, and trinkets; but this could never be sufficient to support the number of domestics and other expenses they must incur. Their greatest dependence therefore was on the presents they received from those Europeans and Moors who visited the court, and who employed their influence in obtaining some particular favour from the emperor. This was the most successful mode that could be adopted. When Mr Lempriere was at Morocco, a Jew, desirous of obtaining a very advantageous favour from the emperor, for which he had been a long time unsuccessfully soliciting, sent to all the principal ladies of the harem presents of pearls to a very large amount; the consequence was, that they all went in a body to the emperor, and immediately obtained the wished-for concession.\n\nThe ladies separately furnish their own rooms, hire their own domestics, and, in fact, do what they please in the harem, but are not permitted to go out without an express order from the emperor, who very seldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one palace to another. In that case, a party of soldiers is dispatched a little distance before them, to disperse the male passengers in particular, and to prevent the possibility of their being seen. This previous step being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and afterwards these miserable females cover themselves entirely with their headscarves, and either mount mules, which they ride like men, or, what is more usual, are put into a square carriage or litter, constructed for this purpose, which by its lattice-work allows them to see without being seen. In this manner they set off, under the charge of a guard of black eunuchs. This journey, and sometimes a walk within the bounds of the palace, with which they are, however, seldom indulged, is the only exercise they are permitted to take.\n\nThe late emperor's harem consisted of between 60 and 100 females, besides their domestics and slaves, which were very numerous. Many of the concubines were Moorish women, who had been presented to the emperor, as the Moors consider it an honour to have their daughters in the harem; several were European slaves, who had either been made captives, or purchased by the emperor; and some were Negroes.\n\nIn this group the Europeans, or their descendants, had by far the greatest claim to the character of handsome. There was one in particular, who was a native of Spain, and taken into the harem at about the same age as Lalla Douyauw, who was indeed a perfect beauty. Nor was this lady quite singular in that respect, for many others were almost equally handsome.\n\nThe eunuchs, who have the entire charge of the women, and who in fact live always among them, are the children of Negro slaves. They are generally either very short and fat, or else tall, deformed, and lame. Their voices have that particular tone which is observable in youths who are just arriving at manhood; and their persons altogether afford a disgusting image of weakness and effeminacy.\n\nThe same gentleman gives us a very curious account of the manners and ignorance of these immured females, from his own observation, when visiting the prince's harem. \"Attended by an eunuch (says he), after passing the gate of the harem, which is always locked, and under the care of a guard of eunuchs, we entered a narrow and dark passage, which soon brought us to the court, into which the women's chambers open. We here saw numbers of both black and white women and children; some concubines, some slaves, and others hired domestics.\n\n\"Upon their observing the unusual figure of an European, the whole multitude in a body surrounded me, and expressed the utmost astonishment at my dress and appearance. Some stood motionless, with their hands lifted up, their eyes fixed, and their mouths open, in\nthe usual attitude of wonder and surprize. Some burst into immoderate fits of laughter; while others again came up, and with uncommon attention eyed me from head to foot. The parts of my dress which seemed most to attract their notice were my buckles, buttons, and stockings; for neither men nor women in this country wear any thing of the kind. With respect to the club of my hair, they seemed utterly at a loss in what view to consider it; but the powder which I wore they conceived to be employed for the purpose of destroying vermin. Most of the children, when they saw me, ran away in the most perfect consternation; and on the whole, I appeared as singular an animal, and I dare say had the honour of exciting as much curiosity and attention, as a lion or man-tiger just imported from abroad, and introduced into a country town in England on a market-day. Every time I visited the harem, I was surrounded and laughed at by this curious mob, who, on my entering the gate, followed me close to the very chamber to which I was proceeding, and on my return universally escorted me out.\n\n\"The greatest part of the women were uncommonly fat and unwieldy; had black and full eyes, round faces, with small noses. They were of different complexions; some very fair, some sallow, and others again perfect Negroes.\n\n\"One of my new patients being ready to receive me, I was desired to walk into her room; where, to my great surprize, I saw nothing but a curtain drawn quite across the apartment, similar to that of a theatre which separates the stage from the audience. A female domestick brought a very low stool, placed it near the curtain, and told me I was to sit down there, and feel her mistress's pulse.\n\n\"The lady, who had by this time summoned up courage to speak, introduced her hand from the bottom of the curtain, and desired me to inform her of all her complaints, which she conceived I might perfectly do by merely feeling the pulse. It was in vain to ask her where her pain was seated, whether in her stomach, head, or back; the only answer I could procure was a request to feel the pulse of the other hand, and then point out the seat of the disease, and the nature of the pain.\n\n\"Having neither satisfied my curiosity by exhibiting her face, nor made me acquainted with the nature of her complaint, I was under the necessity of informing her in positive terms, that to understand the disease it was absolutely necessary to see the tongue as well as to feel the pulse; and that without it I could do nothing for her. My eloquence, or rather that of my Jewish interpreter, was, however, for a long time exerted in vain; and I am persuaded she would have dismissed me without any further inquiry, had not her invention supplied her with a happy expedient to remove her embarrassment. She contrived at last to cut a hole through the curtain, through which she extruded her tongue, and thus complied with my injunction as far as it was necessary in a medical view, but most effectually disappointed my curiosity.\n\n\"I was afterwards ordered to look at another of the prince's wives, who was affected with a ferulous swelling in her neck. This lady was, in the same manner as the other, at first excluded from my sight; but as she was obliged to show me her complaint, I had an opportunity of seeing her face, and observed it to be very homely.\"\n\nIt is curious to observe the strange and childish notions of persons who have been wholly secluded from the world. All the ladies of the harem expected that our author should have instantly discovered their complaints upon feeling the pulse, and that he could cure every disease instantaneously. He found them proud and vain of their persons, and extremely ignorant. \"Among many ridiculous questions, they asked my interpreter (says Mr Lempriere) if I could read and write; upon being answered in the affirmative, they expressed the utmost surprize and admiration at the abilities of the Christians. There was not one among them who could do either; these rudiments of learning are indeed only the lot of a few of their men, who on that account are named Talbs, or explainers of the Mahometan law.\"\n\nIt is melancholy to reflect on the situation of these unfortunate women. Being considered as the mere instruments of pleasure, no attention is paid to the improvement of their minds. They have no employment to occupy their time. Their needle-work is performed by Jewesses; their food is drugged, and their chambers taken care of, by slaves and domestics. They have no amusement but a rude and barbarous kind of melancholy music, without melody, variety, or taste; and conversation with one another, which must indeed be very confined, uniform, and inanimate, as they never see a new object. Excluded from the enjoyment of fresh air and exercise, so necessary for the support of health and life; deprived of all society but that of their fellow sufferers, a society to which most of them would prefer solitude itself; they are only to be considered as the most abject of slaves—slaves to the vices and caprice of a licentious tyrant, who exacts even from his wives themselves a degree of submission and respect which borders upon idolatry, and which God and nature never meant should be paid to a mortal.\n\nSERAI, a building on the high-road, or in large cities in India, erected for the accommodation of travelers.\n\nSERAPH, or SERAPHIM, spirits of the highest rank in the hierarchy of angels; who are thus called from their being supposed to be most inflamed with divine love, by their nearer and more immediate attendance at the throne of God, and to communicate their fervour to the remoter and inferior orders. Seraphim is the Hebrew plural of seraph. See ANGEL.\n\nSERAPHIC, burning or inflamed with love or zeal, like a seraphim: thus St Bonaventure is called the seraphic doctor, from his abundant zeal and fervour.\n\nSERAPIAS, a genus of plants belonging to the class of gynandria; and in the natural system arranged under the seventh order Orchidaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nSERAPION, a physician of Alexandria. He and Philinus of the isle of Cos were both scholars of Herophilus, and were founders of the empiric sect; which happened about 287 B.C.\n\nSERAPIS, in Mythology, an Egyptian deity, who was worshipped under various names and attributes, as the tutelary god of Egypt in general, and as the patron of several of their principal cities. Tacitus informs us, that he was worshipped as a kind of universal deity that represented Esculapius, Osiris, Jupiter, and Pluto; and\nhe was sometimes taken for Jupiter Ammon, the Sun, and Neptune: and the honours that were rendered to him at Alexandria were more solemn and extraordinary than those of any other place.\n\nPlutarch and Clemens of Alexandria, as well as Tae. Hift. citus *, inform us, that while the first Ptolemy was employed in fortifying Alexandria with walls, adorning it with temples and stately buildings, there appeared to him in his sleep a young man of extraordinary beauty, of a stature more than human, admonishing him to dispatch into Pontus some of his most trusty friends to bring from thence his statue: he assured him, that the city and kingdom which possessed it should prove happy, glorious, and powerful. The young man having thus spoken, disappeared, mounting up into heaven in a blaze of fire.\n\nPtolemy discovered his vision to the priests; but finding them ignorant of Pontus, he had recourse to an Athenian, who informed him that near Sinope, a city of Pontus, there was a temple much revered by the natives, which was consecrated to Pluto, where he had a statue, near which stood that of a woman. Ptolemy, neglecting the injunctions of the apparition, it again appeared to him in a menacing attitude; and the king immediately dispatched ambassadors to the Serapian monarch, loaded with presents. The king of Sinope consented; but his subjects opposed the removal of the statue. The god, however, of his own accord, as we are informed, conveyed himself to the ambassador's ship; and in three days landed in Alexandria. The statue of Serapis was erected in one of the suburbs of the city, where a magnificent temple was afterwards reared.\n\nThe statue of Serapis, according to Macrobius, was of a human form, with a basket or bushel on his head, signifying plenty; his right hand leaned on the head of a serpent, whose body was wound round a figure with three heads, of a dog, a lion, and a wolf; in his left hand he held a measure of a cubit length, as it were to take the height of the waters of the Nile. The figure of Serapis is found on many ancient medals.\n\nThe famous temple of Serapis at Alexandria was destroyed by order of Theodosius; and the celebrated statue of this deity was broken in pieces, and its limbs carried first in triumph by the Christians through the city, and then thrown into a fierce fire, kindled for that purpose in the amphitheatre. As the Egyptians ascribed the overflowing of the Nile, to which was owing the fertility of their country, to the benign influence of their god Serapis, they concluded, that now he was destroyed, the river would no longer overflow, and that a general famine would ensue; but when they observed, on the contrary, that the Nile swelled to a greater height than had been known in the memory of man, and thereby produced an immense plenty of all kinds of provisions, many of the pagans renouncing the worship of idols, adored the God of the Christians.\n\nSERENA GUTTA, the same as amaryllis. See MEDICINE, No. 365.\n\nSERENADE, a kind of concert given in the night by a lover to his mistress, under her window. These sometimes only consist of instrumental music, but at other times voices are added: the music and songs composed for these occasions are also called serenades.\n\nSERENE, a title of honour given to several princes and to the principal magistrates of republics. The king of Britain, the republic and doge of Venice, and the children of the king of Spain, are called most serene; and when the pope or the sacred college write to the emperor, to kings, or to the doge, they give them no other title. In like manner, the emperor gives no other title to any king, except to the king of France.\n\nSERENUS, SAMMONICUS, a celebrated physician in the reigns of the emperors Severus and Caracalla, in and about the year 200. He wrote several treatises on history and the works of nature; but there is only one of them extant, which is a very indifferent poem on the Remedies of Diseases. He was murdered at a festival by the order of Caracalla. He had a library that contained 62,000 volumes, which Quintus Serenus Sammonicus his son gave to Gordian the Younger, to whom he was preceptor.\n\nSERES (Ptolemy); a people of the Farther Asia; bounded on the west by Scythia extra Imaum; on the north and east, by Terra Incognita; and on the south, by India extra Gangem. According to these limits, their country answers nearly to Cathay or North China. Other authors vary greatly in placing them, though the generality agree in placing them far to the east. Mela places them between the Indi and Scythæ; and perhaps beyond the Indi, if we distinguish the Sinæ from them. The ancients commend them for their cotton manufactures, different from the produce of the bombyces or silk-worms, called feres by the Greeks; whence ferica, \"silk.\"\n\nSERGE, a woollen quilted stuff, manufactured on a loom with four treadles, after the manner of ratenes, and other stuffs that have the whale. The goodness of ferges is known by the quilting, as that of cloths by the spinning. Of ferges there are various kinds, denominated either from the different qualities thereof, or from the places where they are wrought. The most considerable is the London ferge, now highly valued abroad, particularly in France, where a manufacture is carried on with considerable success, under the title of ferge façon de Londres.\n\nThe method of making the London ferge we shall now describe: For wool, the longest is chosen for the warp, and the shortest for the woof. Before either kind is used, it is first scoured, by putting it in a copper of liquor, somewhat more than lukewarm, composed of three parts of fair water and one of urine. After having stayed long enough therein for the liquor to dissolve, and take off the greaie, &c., it is stirred briskly about with a wooden peel; taken out of the liquor, drained, and washed in a running water, dried in the shade, beaten with sticks on a wooden rack to drive out the coarser dust and filth, and then picked clean with the hands. Thus far prepared, it is greased with oil of olives, and the longest part, destined for the warp, is combed with large combs, heated in a little furnace for the purpose. To clear off the oil again, the wool is put in a liquor composed of hot water, with soap melted therein: whence being taken out, wrung, and dried, it is spun on the wheel.\n\nAs to the shorter wool, intended for the woof, it is only carded on the knee with small cards, and then spun on the wheel, without being scoured of its oil. It must be remarked, that the thread for the warp is always to be spun much finer, and better twisted than that of the woof. The wool both for the warp and the\nthe woof being spun, and the thread divided into skeins, that of the woof is put on spools (unless it have been spun upon them) fit for the cavity or eye of the shuttle; and that for the warp is wound on a kind of wooden bobbins to fit it for warping. When warped, it is stiffened with a kind of size, wherof that made of the shreds of parchment is held the best; and when dry is put on the loom.\n\nWhen mounted on the loom, the workman raising and lowering the threads (which are passed through a reed), by means of four tredles placed underneath the loom, which he makes to act transversely, equally, and alternately, one after another, with his feet, in proportion as the threads are raised and lowered, throws the shuttle across from one side to the other; and each time that the shuttle is thrown, and the thread of the woof is crossed between those of the warp, strikes it with the frame to which the reed is fastened, through those teeth the threads of the warp pass; and this stroke he repeats twice or thrice, or even more, till he judges the crossing of the serge sufficiently close: thus he proceeds till the warp is all filled with woof.\n\nThe serge now taken off the loom is carried to the fuller, who scour it in the trough of his mill with a kind of fat earth, called fuller's earth, first purged of all stones and filth. After three or four hours scouring, the fuller's earth is washed out in fair water, brought by little and little into the trough, out of which it is taken when all the earth is cleared; then, with a kind of iron pincers or pliers, they pull off all the knots, ends, straws, &c. sticking out on the surface on either side; and then returning it into the fulling trough, where it is worked with water somewhat more than lukewarm, with soap dissolved therein for near two hours: it is then washed out till such time as the water becomes quite clear, and there be no signs of soap left; then it is taken out of the trough, the knots, &c. again pulled off, and then put on the tenter to dry, taking care as fast as it dries to stretch it out both in length and breadth till it be brought to its just dimensions. When well dried, it is taken off the tenter, and dyed, thorn, and preffed.\n\n**SERGEANT**, or **SERJEANT at Law**, or of the **Coif**, is the highest degree taken at the common law, as that of Doctor is of the civil law; and as these are supposed to be the most learned and experienced in the practice of the courts, there is one court appointed for them to plead in by themselves, which is the common pleas, where the common law of England is most strictly observed: but they are not restricted from pleading in any other court, where the judges, who cannot have that honour till they have taken the degree of sergeant at law, call them brothers.\n\n**SERGEANT at Arms**, or **Mace**, an officer appointed to attend the person of the king; to arrest traitors, and such persons of quality as offend; and to attend the lord high steward, when sitting in judgement on a traitor.\n\nOf these, by statute 13 Richard II. cap. 6, there are not to be above 30 in the realm. There are now nine at court at 100l. per annum salary each; they are called the king's sergeants at arms, to distinguish them from others: they are created with great ceremony, the person kneeling before the king, his majesty lays the mace on his right shoulder, and says, *Rise up, sergeants at arms*, and *squire for ever*. They have, besides, a patent for the office, which they hold for life.\n\nThey have their attendance in the presence-chamber, where the band of gentlemen-pensioners wait; and, receiving the king at the door, they carry the maces before him to the chapel door, whilst the band of pensioners stand foremost, and make a lane for the king, as they also do when the king goes to the house of lords.\n\nThere are four other sergeants at arms, created in the same manner; one, who attends the lord chancellor; a second, the lord treasurer; a third, the speaker of the house of commons; and a fourth, the lord mayor of London on solemn occasions.\n\nThey have a considerable share of the fees of honour, and travelling charges allowed them when in waiting, viz. five shillings per day when the court is within ten miles of London, and ten shillings when twenty miles from London. The places are in the lord chamberlain's gift.\n\nThere are also sergeants of the mace of an inferior kind, who attend the mayor or other head officer of a corporation.\n\n**Common Sergeant**, an officer in the city of London, who attends the lord mayor and court of aldermen on court days, and is in council with them on all occasions, within and without the precincts or liberties of the city. He is to take care of orphan estates, either by taking account of them, or to sign their indentures, before their passing the lord mayor and court of aldermen: and he was likewise to let and manage the orphan estates, according to his judgement to their best advantage. See Recorder.\n\n**Sergeant**, in **War**, is an uncommissioned officer in a company of foot or troop of dragoons, armed with an halbert, and appointed to see discipline observed, to teach the soldiers the exercise of their arms, to order, straiten, and form their ranks, files, &c. He receives the orders from the adjutant, which he communicates to his officers. Each company generally has two sergeants.\n\n**Sergeantry** (**Serjeantia**), signifies, in law, a service that cannot be due by a tenant to any lord but the king; and this is either **grand sergeantry**, or **petit**. The first is a tenure by which the one holds his lands of the king by such services as he ought to do in person to the king at his coronation; and may also concern matters military, or services of honour in peace; as to be the king's butler, carver, &c. **Petit sergeantry** is where a man holds lands of the king to furnish him yearly with some small thing towards his wars; and in effect payable as rent. Though all tenures are turned into socage by the 12 Car. II. cap. 24, yet the honorary services of grand sergeantry still remain, being therein excepted. See Knight-Service.\n\n**Series**, in general, denotes a continual succession of things in the same order, and having the same relation or connection with each other: in this sense we say, a series of emperors, kings, bishops, &c.\n\nIn natural history, a series is used for an order or subdivision of some classes of natural bodies; comprehending all such as are distinguished from the other bodies of that class, by certain characters which they possess in common, and which the rest of the bodies of that class have not.\nSeries\n\n(1.) Series, in Arithmetic or Algebra, a rank or progression of quantities which succeed one another according to some determinate law. For example, the numbers\n\n\\[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, \\ldots\\]\n\nconstitute a series, the law of which is that each term exceeds that before it by a given number, viz. 2. Again, the numbers\n\n\\[3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, \\ldots\\]\n\nconstitute a series of a different kind, each term being the product of the term before it, and the given number 2.\n\n(2.) As the law according to which the terms of a series are formed may be infinitely varied, there may be innumerable kinds of series; we shall enumerate a few of the most common.\n\n1. Arithmetical Series. The general form of a series of this kind is\n\n\\[a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, \\ldots\\]\n\nand its law is that the difference between any two adjacent terms is the same quantity, viz. \\(d\\). The first of the two preceding examples is a series of this nature.\n\n2. Geometrical Series. Its general form is\n\n\\[a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4, \\ldots\\]\n\nIn this kind of series each term is the product of that which precedes it and a constant number \\(r\\), which is called the common ratio of the terms. The second of the above examples is a particular case of a geometrical series.\n\n3. Harmonic Series is that in which the first of any three of its consecutive terms is to the third, as the difference between the first and second to the difference between the second and third; hence we readily find that putting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) for its two first terms, its general form will be\n\n\\[\\frac{ab}{2a-b}, \\frac{ab}{3a-2b}, \\frac{ab}{4a-3b}, \\ldots\\]\n\nIf we suppose \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we get\n\n\\[1, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\ldots\\]\n\nas a particular example of a harmonic series.\n\n4. Recurring Series. Let its terms be denoted by\n\n\\[A, B, C, D, E, F, \\ldots\\]\n\nThen, we shall form a recurring series, if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) being put for given quantities, we take\n\n\\[C = mA + nB, \\quad E = mC + nD,\\]\n\\[D = mB + nC, \\quad F = mD + nE.\\]\n\nFor example, let us suppose \\(A = 1, B = 2x, C = 4x^2, n = 3x\\); then \\(C = 10x^3, D = 38x^4, E = 154x^5, F = 614x^6\\), so that the first six terms of the series are\n\n\\[1, 2x, 10x^3, 38x^4, 154x^5, 614x^6.\\]\n\nWe have here supposed each term to be formed from the two which come immediately before it; but the name recurring series is given to every one in which the terms are formed in like manner from some assigned number of the terms which precede that sought. Thus, putting as before \\(A, B, C, D, \\ldots\\) for the terms of the series, and \\(m, n, p, q\\) for given quantities, we shall have another recurring series, if we suppose them so related that\n\n\\[mA + nB + pC + qD = 0,\\]\n\\[mB + nC + pD + qE = 0,\\]\n\\[mC + nD + pE + qF = 0.\\]\n\nThe two series of quantities fin. \\(a, fin. 2a, fin. 3a, \\ldots\\) and cof. \\(a, cof. 2a, cof. 3a, \\ldots\\) are both recurring, as is manifest from the law which connects the quantities one with another. (See Algebra, § 358.)\n\n(3.) As in general it is the sum of the terms of a series which is the object of investigation, it is usual to connect them by the sign \\(+\\) or \\(-\\), and to apply the name series to the expression thus formed. Accordingly\n\n\\[1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + \\cdots + \\left\\{1 + 2(n-1)\\right\\}\\]\n\n(where \\(n\\) denotes the number of terms) is called an arithmetical series; and in like manner\n\n\\[1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\\]\n\nis a geometrical series.\n\n(4.) A series may either consist of a definite number of terms, or their number may be supposed greater than any that can be assigned, and in this case the series is said to be infinite. The number of terms of a series may be infinite, and yet their sum finite. This is true: for example, of the series\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\ldots\\]\n\nwhich is equivalent to unity, or 1.\n\n(5.) We have already treated of several branches of the doctrine of series in the articles Algebra, Fluxions and Logarithms; and in particular we have given four different methods for expanding a quantity into a series, viz:\n\n1. By Division or Evolution. (See Algebra, § 78, and § 260.)\n2. By the Method of Indeterminate Coefficients. (Algebra, § 261.)\n3. By the Binomial Theorem. (Algebra, § 263—§ 269.)\n4. By Taylor's Theorem. (Fluxions, § 66—§ 72.)\n\nWe shall here treat briefly of another branch of the theory, namely, how to find the sum of any proposed number of terms of certain series, or the sum of their terms continued ad infinitum, when that sum is finite.\n\n(6.) There is a great analogy between the terms of a series and the ordinates of a curve which are supposed to stand upon the axis at equal distances from one another, the first ordinate reckoned from the extremity of the axes being analogous to the first term of the series, the second ordinate to the second term, and so on. From this analogy it follows immediately, that like as the nature of a curve is indicated by an equation expressing the value of an indefinite ordinate in terms of its corresponding abscissa, so also the nature of a series may be shown by an equation which shall express the relation between any term; and the number that denotes the place or order of that term in the series. In conformity\nSeries. conformity to this method, putting the symbols $T^{(1)}$, $T^{(2)}$, $T^{(3)}$, &c., to denote the terms of any series whatever, we may express it generally thus.\n\n$$T^{(1)} + T^{(2)} + T^{(3)} + \\cdots + T^{(n)}$$\n\nwhere the characters (1), (2), are meant to denote the place or order of the terms to which they are joined, (the first term being supposed to have the place 1, the second term the place 2, and so on) and (n) is put for any indefinite number.\n\nThe nature of the arithmetical series\n\n$$a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + \\cdots$$\n\nwill be defined by the equation\n\n$$T^{(n)} = a + (v-1)d,$$\n\nand, in like manner, the nature of the geometrical series\n\n$$a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\cdots$$\n\nwill be expressed by the equation\n\n$$T^{(n)} = ar^n.$$\n\n(7.) As the expression for the value of the indefinite term $T^{(n)}$ becomes identical with all the terms of the series in succession, by substituting the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c., one after another for v, that expression is called the general term of the series. In the series\n\n$$a + b + \\frac{ab}{2} - \\frac{ab}{3} + \\frac{ab}{4} - \\frac{ab}{5} + \\cdots$$\n\nthe general term is evidently $\\frac{ab}{(v-1)a-(v-2)b}$.\n\n(8.) We shall now investigate the sum of any number of terms of such series as have their general terms expressed by any one of the following algebraic functions\n\n$$v, \\frac{v(v+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}, \\frac{v(v+1)(v+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}, \\frac{v(v+1)(v+2)(v+3)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}, \\ldots$$\n\nProblem I. It is proposed to find the sum of n terms of the series of which the general term is the first function.\n\nBy putting 1, 2, 3, &c., to n successively for v, it appears that the series to be summed is\n\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\cdots + n.$$ \n\nNow, as $v = \\frac{v(v+1)}{2} - \\frac{(v-1)v}{2}$, we have, by putting in this formula 1, 2, 3, \\ldots to n successively for v,\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n1 &= \\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{2} - 0, \\\\\n2 &= \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{2} - \\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{2}, \\\\\n3 &= \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2} - \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{2}, \\\\\n4 &= \\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{2} - \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nLet the sum of the quantities on each side of the sign = be now taken; then, observing that each of the fractions on the right hand side, with the exception of $\\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}$, occurs twice, once with the sign +, and again with the sign -, by which it happens that their aggregate is = 0, it is evident that we have\n\n$$1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}.$$ \n\nProb. II. It is proposed to sum n terms of the series having for its general term the second function\n\n$$\\frac{v(v+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}.$$ \n\nThis series, by substituting 1, 2, 3, &c., successively for v, is found to be\n\n$$\\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\cdots + \\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}.$$ \n\nWe now, following the mode of proceeding employed in last problem, put the expression $\\frac{v(v+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}$ under this form,\n\n$$\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{(v-1)v(v+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3},$$\n\nto which it is evidently equivalent, and, substituting 1, 2, 3, &c., successively for v, find\n\n$$\\begin{align*}\n1 \\cdot 2 &= \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - 0, \\\\\n2 \\cdot 3 &= \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}, \\\\\n3 \\cdot 4 &= \\frac{3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}, \\\\\n4 \\cdot 5 &= \\frac{4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}, \\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}$$\n\n$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} - \\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}.$$ \n\nIn this problem, as in the former, it appears that each quantity on the right side of the equations, except $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}$, occurs twice, and with contrary signs; therefore, taking the aggregate of the terms on each side, we have\n\n$$\\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\cdots + \\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3}.$$ \n\n(9.) It will be obvious, by a little attention to the solutions of these two problems, that in each the terms of the series to be summed are the differences between the adjacent\nSeries adjacent terms of another series, namely, that which has for its general term the function next in order to the general term of the series under consideration; that is, the terms of the series whose general term is \\( v \\), are the differences betwixt those of the series having \\( \\frac{v(v+1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\) for its general terms; and, again, the terms of this last are the differences of the terms of the series having \\( \\frac{v(v+1)(v+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\) for its general term. Now as the sum of the differences of any series of quantities whatever which begins with \\( o \\) must necessarily be the last term of that series*, it follows, that the sum of all the terms of each of the series we have considered must be equal to the last term of the next following series; and this term is necessarily the expression formed by substituting \\( n \\) for \\( v \\) in its general term, that is, the sum of the series \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + n \\), which has \\( v \\) for its general term, is \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\); and the sum of the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 \\cdot 2}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\cdots + \\frac{n(n+1)}{1 \\cdot 2}\n\\]\n\nis \\( \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\).\n\nThe next series which has \\( \\frac{v(v+1)(v+2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} \\) for its general term, as well as all that succeed, will be found to have the very same property, as may be proved as follows. Let \\( p \\) denote any term of the series of natural numbers \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\). Then, because\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v+p}{p+1} = \\frac{v-1}{p+1},\n\\]\n\nif we multiply these equals by the product of all the factors \\( v, v+1, v+2, \\ldots \\), we get\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p-1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots p} = \\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (p+1)}.\n\\]\n\nNow, if in this identical equation we substitute the numbers \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) to \\( n \\) successively for \\( v \\), the results obtained from its first member\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p-1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots p}\n\\]\n\nwill be a series having this function for its general term, and the terms of which will evidently be the difference between the terms of another series having the first part of the second member of the equation, viz.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (p+1)}.\n\\]\n\nfor its general term: Hence it will happen, as in the two foregoing problems, that the sum of all the terms of the former series will be equal to the last term of the latter; which conclusion may be expressed in the form of a theorem, as follows:\n\n**Theorem.** The sum of \\( n \\) terms of a series having for its general term the function,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p-1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots p}\n\\]\n\nis equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2) \\cdots (n+p)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots (p+1)}.\n\\]\n\nOr, setting aside the denominators of the terms, we may express the theorem thus: The sum of \\( n \\) terms of a series, having for its general term the expression\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v(v+1)(v+2) \\cdots (v+p-1)}{p+1}\n\\]\n\nis equal to\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2) \\cdots (n+p)}{p+1}.\n\\]\n\nWe shall here give a few particular cases of this last general formula.\n\nI. \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n\nII. \\( 1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot 5 + \\cdots + n(n+1) = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3} \\).\n\nIII. \\( 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 + \\cdots + n(n+1)(n+2) = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{4} \\).\n\n(10.) By means of the above general theorem we may find the sum of any number of terms of a series composed of the powers of the terms of an arithmetical progression, the general term of which will, in the simplest case, be \\( v^p \\), \\( p \\) being a given number. The manner of doing this will appear from the following problems.\n\n**Prob. III.** It is proposed to find the sum of \\( n \\) terms of the series of squares \\( 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + \\ldots \\) or \\( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + \\ldots \\).\n\nThe general term of this series being \\( v^2 \\), we put it under this form, \\( v(v+1)-v \\); hence we get by substituting \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\) for \\( v \\),\n\n\\[\n1^2 = 1 \\cdot 2 - 1,\n\\]\n\\[\n2^2 = 2 \\cdot 3 - 2,\n\\]\n\\[\n3^2 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 3,\n\\]\n\\[\n4^2 = 4 \\cdot 5 - 4,\n\\]\n\\[\n\\vdots\n\\]\n\\[\nn^2 = n(n+1) - n.\n\\]\n\nTherefore adding, we find\n\n\\[\n1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + \\cdots + n^2 = \\frac{1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + \\cdots + n(n+1)}{(1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + n)}.\n\\]\n\nBut\n\n* For example, let the quantities be \\( o, a, b, c, d \\); then it is manifest that \\( (a-o) + (b-a) + (c-b) + (d-c) = d \\).\nBut by the general theorem (9.)\n\n\\[1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3 + 3 \\cdot 4 + \\cdots + n(n+1) = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{3},\\]\n\nand,\n\n\\[1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \\cdots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2};\\]\n\ntherefore\n\n\\[\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} = \\frac{n(n+1)^2}{2}.\\]\n\nWe might have arrived at the same conclusion by considering that since \\(v^3\\), the general term of the series, is equivalent to \\(v(v+1)-v\\), the series must be the difference between two others, one having \\(v(v+1)\\) and the other \\(v\\) for its general term; for the sake of perspicuity, however, we have put down the terms of all the three series.\n\n**Prob.

Required the sum of the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 7} + \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 10} + \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 13} + \\frac{1}{10 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 16} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\ncontinued ad infinitum.\n\nBy a little attention it will appear that its terms are produced by the substitution of the numbers \\( \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{7}, \\frac{1}{10}, \\ldots \\) successively for \\( v \\) in the function\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3v(3v+3)(3v+6)} = \\frac{1}{27v(v+1)(v+2)}\n\\]\n\nIn this case then \\( a = \\frac{1}{3}, p = 2 \\), therefore the sum is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{27} \\times \\frac{1}{1} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n\n(15.) When the function from which the series is derived has not the very form required in the theorem, it may be brought to that form by employing suitable transformations, as in the two following examples.\n\nEx. 3. It is proposed to find the sum of the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 5} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 6} + \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\ncontinued ad infinitum.\n\nThis series is evidently formed by the substitution of the numbers 1, 2, 3, &c., successively for \\( v \\) in the function \\( \\frac{1}{v(v+3)} \\). This expression, however, does not in its present form agree with the general formula, because the factors \\( v+1, v+2 \\) are wanting; therefore to transform it, we multiply its numerator and denominator by \\( (v+1)(v+2) \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[\n\\frac{(v+1)(v+2)}{v(v+1)(v+2)(v+3)}\n\\]\n\nwe next assume its numerator\n\n\\[\n(v+1)(v+2) = A(v+2)(v+3) + B(v+3) + C,\n\\]\n\nand by multiplying get\n\n\\[\nv^3 + 3v^2 + 2 = Av^3 + (5A + B)v + (6A + 3B + C);\n\\]\n\ntherefore, that \\( v \\) may be indeterminate, we must make\n\n\\[\nA = 1, 5A + B = 3, 6A + 3B + C = 2,\n\\]\n\nfrom which equations we get \\( A = 1, B = 3 - 5A = -2, C = 2 - 6A - 3B = 2 \\), so that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{v(v+3)} = \\frac{(v+2)(v+3) - 2(v+3) + 2}{v(v+1)(v+2)(v+3)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{v(v+1)} - \\frac{2}{v(v+1)(v+2)}\n\\]\n\nThus it appears that the proposed series is resolvable into three others, the general terms of which all agree with the theorem. Now the sum of the infinite series whose general term is \\( \\frac{1}{v(v+1)} \\) appears by the theorem to be \\( \\frac{1}{a} \\), or 1, because \\( a = 1 \\), and the sum of the infinite series whose general term is \\( \\frac{-2}{v(v+1)(v+2)} \\) is in like manner found to be \\( \\frac{-2}{2} + \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{-1}{2} \\); and lastly, the infinite series whose general term is \\( \\frac{2}{v(v+1)(v+2)(v+3)} \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{1}{9} \\); therefore, collecting these into one, the sum of the proposed series is \\( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{11}{18} \\), the answer.\n\nEx. 4. Required the sum of the infinite series.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{2}{3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} + \\frac{3}{4 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 6} + \\frac{4}{5 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 7} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nThe terms of this series are evidently formed by the substitution of the numbers 2, 3, 4, successively in the function\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v-1}{v(v+1)(v+2)}\n\\]\n\nNow \\( v-1 = v+2-3 \\); therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{v-1}{v(v+1)(v+2)} = \\frac{1}{v(v+1)} - \\frac{3}{v(v+1)(v+2)};\n\\]\n\nthus it appears that the proposed series is reducible to two others, one having its terms produced by the substitution of 2, 3, &c., for \\( v \\) in the function \\( \\frac{1}{v(v+1)} \\), and the other by a like substitution in the function \\( \\frac{-3}{v(v+1)(v+2)} \\). Now, by our theorem, the sum of the first of these is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), and that of the second is \\( \\frac{-3}{2} \\).\nSeries.\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\ntherefore the sum of the proposed series is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nFrom these examples it is sufficiently evident how the theorem is to be applied in other cases; and it appears also that by means of it we can sum any series whatever whose general term is of the form\n\n\\[\n\\frac{A}{v(v+1)} + \\frac{B}{v(v+1)(v+2)} + \\frac{C}{v(v+1)(v+2)(v+3)} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nor admits of being reduced to that form.\n\n(16.) It deserves to be remarked that the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\ldots\n\\]\n\nwhich is of a very simple form, and in appearance of the same nature as those we have summed, does not however admit of being treated in the same manner; and indeed, if it be continued ad infinitum, its sum is infinite, that is, it exceeds any number which can be assigned. The truth of this assertion will be evident if we can shew that a certain definite number of its terms, beginning with any proposed term, can always be found, the sum of which shall exceed an unit or 1; for this being the case, as we can go on continually in assigning such sets of terms, we can conceive as many to be taken as there are units in any proposed number however great; and therefore their sum, and much more the sum of all the terms of the series from its beginning to the end of the last set of terms will exceed that number. Now that this can always be done may be proved as follows:\n\nLet the term of the series from which we are to reckon be \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\); then, if the thing be possible, and if \\(n\\) be the requisite number of terms, we must have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} + \\frac{1}{a+2} + \\frac{1}{a+3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a+n-1} > 1.\n\\]\n\nNow because\n\n\\[\na \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^2 = a + 2 + \\frac{1}{a};\n\\]\n\n\\[\na \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^3 = a + 3 + \\frac{3}{a} + \\frac{1}{a^2};\n\\]\n\nand in general,\n\n\\[\na \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^p = a + p + \\frac{p(p-1)}{1 \\cdot 2} \\frac{1}{a} + \\cdots,\n\\]\n\ntherefore, \\(p\\) being any whole number,\n\n\\[\na \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^p = a + p, \\text{ and consequently}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a+p} > \\frac{1}{a \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^p};\n\\]\n\nhence it follows that the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} + \\frac{1}{a+2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a+n-1}\n\\]\n\nwill be greater than the other series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)} + \\frac{1}{a \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{n-1}};\n\\]\n\nNow this last being evidently a geometrical series, of which the common ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{a}}\\), its sum is\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{1}{a} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-n};\n\\]\n\ntherefore, the sum of the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} + \\frac{1}{a+2} + \\frac{1}{a+3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a+n-1}\n\\]\n\nwill always be greater than this expression; but if we suppose \\(n\\) so great that the quantity \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-n}\\) is equal to, or exceeds \\(a\\), which is evidently always possible, then the above expression for the sum of the geometrical series will be equal to 1, or will exceed 1; therefore, the same number of terms of the series \\(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} + \\frac{1}{a+2} + \\frac{1}{a+3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a+n-1}\\), &c., will always exceed 1; now this is the property of the series we proposed to demonstrate.\n\nWhen \\(a = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-n}\\), then \\(a^n = a \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{a}\\right)^{-n}\\), but this quantity is greater than \\(a + n - 1\\) the denominator of the last term of the series\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{a+1} + \\frac{1}{a+2} + \\frac{1}{a+3} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a+n-1},\n\\]\n\nthe sum of which, we have proved, will upon that hypothesis exceed unity; much more then will the sum exceed unity if we suppose the series continued until the denominator of its last term be equal to, or greater than \\(a^n\\).\n\nHence, beginning with the term \\(\\frac{1}{a}\\), it appears that\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2} > 1,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{1}{5^2} > 1,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{67} = \\frac{1}{67^2} > 1,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{87} + \\frac{1}{89} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{458329} = \\frac{1}{677^2} > 1,\n\\]\n\n&c.\n\nAlthough the sum of the series we have been considering is infinite, yet it evidently increases very slowly; indeed it is a limit to all such as have a finite sum; for every\nSeries. every infinite series, the terms of which decrease faster than the reciprocals of an arithmetical progression, is always finite.\n\n(17.) We have already explained what is meant by a recurring series, (2.) we shall now treat briefly, first, of their origin, next of the way in which they may be summed, and lastly, of the manner of determining the general term of any particular series.\n\nThe series which is produced by the development of a rational algebraic fraction has always the property which constitutes the characteristic of the class called Recurring, (2.) and on the other hand, any series having that property being proposed, an algebraic fraction may be found by the expansion of which the series shall be produced.\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{1 + 2x}{1 - x - x^2}\\), for example, by dividing the numerator by the denominator is converted into the infinite series\n\n\\[1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 7x^3 + 11x^4 + 18x^5 + \\ldots\\]\n\nwhich is of such a nature that if \\(T, T', T''\\) denote any three of its succeeding terms, their relation to one another is expressed by the equation\n\n\\[T'' = T \\cdot x + T' \\cdot x^2.\\]\n\nIf we employ algebraic division to convert the fraction into a series, the law of its terms will not appear so readily as if we use the method of indeterminate coefficients. By this method we assume the fraction\n\n\\[A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots\\]\n\nand hence, multiplying by the denominator, and bringing all the terms to one side, as explained in Algebra, § 267, we have\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nA + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + Ex^4 + \\ldots & = 0, \\\\\n-1 - A - Bx - Cx^2 - Dx^3 - Ex^4 + \\ldots & = 0,\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nand hence,\n\n\\[A = 1 = 0, \\quad C - B - A = 0, \\quad D - C - B = 0, \\quad \\ldots\\]\n\nFrom these equations it appears that the law of the series is such as we have assigned.\n\nThe equation expressing the relation which subsists among a certain number of succeeding terms of a recurring series, is called its scale of Relation. The same name is also sometimes given to the equation expressing the connection of the coefficients of the terms. Thus the scale of relation of the foregoing series is either\n\n\\[T'' = T \\cdot x + T' \\cdot x^2,\\]\n\nwhere \\(T, T', T''\\) denote any three succeeding terms of the series, or it is\n\n\\[R = P + Q,\\]\n\nwhere \\(P, Q\\) and \\(R\\) denote their numeral coefficients.\n\n(18.) We come next to show how the sum of any proposed number of terms of a recurring series may be found. Let the series continued to \\(n\\) terms be\n\n\\[T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots + T(n-1) + T(n),\\]\n\nwhere the characters \\(T(1), T(2), \\ldots\\) denote the successive terms, and the numbers \\((1), (2), \\ldots\\) their order or place; and as whatever number of terms is contained in the scale, the manner of summing the series is the same, we shall in what follows, for the sake of brevity, suppose that it consists of three, in which case it may be expressed thus,\n\n\\[p \\cdot T(n-2) + q \\cdot T(n-1) + r \\cdot T(n) = 0,\\]\n\nwhere \\(p, q, r\\) denote certain given quantities.\n\nThe scale of relation affords the following series of equations,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np \\cdot T(1) + q \\cdot T(2) + r \\cdot T(3) & = 0, \\\\\np \\cdot T(2) + q \\cdot T(3) + r \\cdot T(4) & = 0, \\\\\np \\cdot T(3) + q \\cdot T(4) + r \\cdot T(5) & = 0, \\\\\n& \\vdots \\\\\np \\cdot T(n-2) + q \\cdot T(n-1) + r \\cdot T(n) & = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nTaking now the sum of these equations, we get\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np \\cdot (T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots + T(n-1)) + \\\\\nq \\cdot (T(2) + T(3) + T(4) + \\ldots + T(n)) + \\\\\nr \\cdot (T(3) + T(4) + T(5) + \\ldots + T(n)) & = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nBut, putting \\(s\\) for the sum of \\(n\\) terms of the series, this equation may manifestly be expressed thus,\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np \\cdot (T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots + T(n-1)) + \\\\\nq \\cdot (T(2) + T(3) + T(4) + \\ldots + T(n)) + \\\\\nr \\cdot (T(3) + T(4) + T(5) + \\ldots + T(n)) & = 0.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nHence, after reduction, we find \\(s =\\)\n\n\\[\\frac{p \\cdot (T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots + T(n-1)) + q \\cdot (T(2) + T(3) + T(4) + \\ldots + T(n)) + r \\cdot (T(3) + T(4) + T(5) + \\ldots + T(n))}{p + q + r}.\\]\n\nFrom which it appears that in this case the sum depends only on the two first and the two last terms of the series.\n\nExample. It is proposed to find from this formula the sum of \\(n\\) terms of the series\n\n\\[1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + \\ldots\\]\n\nits scale of relation being\n\n\\[x^2 \\cdot T(n-2) - 2x \\cdot T(n-1) + T(n) = 0.\\]\n\nHere \\(p = x^2, q = -2x, r = 1\\); therefore, observing that the last two terms of the series must be \\((n-1)x^{n-2}\\) and \\(nx^{n-1}\\), we have, after substituting and reducing,\n\n\\[s = \\frac{(n+1)x^n + nx^{n+1}}{1 - 2x + x^2}.\\]\n\nThis formula will not apply in the case of \\(x = 1\\), because then the numerator and denominator are each \\(= 0\\); but in such cases as this we may find the value of the function which expresses the sum by what is delivered at § 93, Fluxions.\n\n(19.) The process by which we have determined the value of \\(n\\) terms of the series \\(T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots\\) will also apply to the finding the rational fraction from which the series may be deduced, which is also the form of the series continued ad infinitum. For in this case the equation from which we have deduced the sum being\n\n\\[\\begin{align*}\np \\cdot (T(1) + T(2) + T(3) + \\ldots + T(n-1)) + \\\\\nq \\cdot (T(2) + T(3) + T(4) + \\ldots + T(n)) + \\\\\nr \\cdot (T(3) + T(4) + T(5) + \\ldots + T(n)) & = 0,\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nthat\nthat is,\n\n\\[ p + q (s - T(1)) + r (s - T(1) - T(2)) = 0, \\]\n\nwe have\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{(q + r) T(1) + r T(2)}{p + q + r}. \\]\n\nFor example, let it be required to find the fraction, which being developed produces the series\n\n\\[ 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nthe scale of relation of which is\n\n\\[ x^3 T(n-2) - 2x T(n-1) + T(n) + 0. \\]\n\nHere \\( p = 2, q = -2x, r = 1, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 2x; \\) therefore, substituting in the formula, we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1 - 2x + x^3} = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \\]\n\nfor the fraction required, or for the sum of the series continued ad infinitum.\n\n(20.) We come now to the last branch of the theory of recurring series which we proposed to consider, namely, how to find in any case the general term.\n\nWe shall begin with the most simple, and suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{a}{1 - px} \\), which being expanded into a series by division, is\n\n\\[ a + apx + ap^2x^2 + ap^3x^3 + \\ldots \\]\n\nhere it is immediately manifest that the general term is \\( ap^{n-1}x^n \\).\n\nNext let us suppose the fraction to be \\( \\frac{a + bx}{1 - ax - bx^2} \\).\n\nLet the two roots of the quadratic equation \\( 1 - ax - bx^2 = 0 \\) be \\( x = \\frac{1}{p}, x = \\frac{1}{q} \\), so that \\( 1 - px = 0 \\), and \\( 1 - qx = 0 \\); therefore, \\( 1 - ax - bx^2 = (1 - px)(1 - qx) \\), thus, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{a + bx}{1 - ax - bx^2} = \\frac{a + bx}{(1 - px)(1 - qx)}. \\]\n\nLet us assume this expression equal to\n\n\\[ \\frac{P}{1 - px} + \\frac{Q}{1 - qx}, \\]\n\nwhere \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) denote quantities which are to be independent of \\( x \\), then, reducing to a common denominator, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{a + bx}{(1 - px)(1 - qx)} = \\frac{P + Q - (qP + pQ)x}{(1 - px)(1 - qx)}. \\]\n\nHence, that \\( x \\) may remain indeterminate, we must make\n\n\\[ P + Q = a, qP + pQ = -b, \\]\n\nand from these equations we get\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{ap + b}{p - q}, Q = \\frac{-aq + b}{p - q}. \\]\n\nNow, by the operation of division, we find\n\n\\[ \\frac{P}{1 - px} = P + Ppx + Pp^2x^2 + \\ldots, \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{Q}{1 - qx} = Q + Qqx + Qq^2x^2 + \\ldots, \\]\n\ntherefore, since \\( \\frac{a + bx}{1 - ax - bx^2} = \\frac{P}{1 - px} + \\frac{Q}{1 - qx} \\), it follows that the development of the fraction \\( \\frac{a + bx}{1 - ax - bx^2} \\), which proceeds according to the powers of \\( x \\), is\n\n\\[ (P + Q)P + Q^2) + (P^2 + Q^2)x + \\ldots, \\]\n\nAnd here it is evident that the general term is \\( (Pp^{n-1} + Qq^{n-1})x^{n-1} \\).\n\nLet us take as a particular example the fraction\n\n\\[ \\frac{1 - x}{1 - x - 2x^2}, \\]\n\nwhich, when expanded into a series, becomes\n\n\\[ 1 + 0x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 6x^4 + 10x^5 + 22x^6 + 42x^7 + 86x^8 + \\ldots \\]\n\nHere, from the equation \\( 1 - x - 2x^2 = 0 \\), we get \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\) and \\( x = -1 \\), so that \\( 1 - 2x \\) and \\( 1 + x \\) are divisors of the function \\( 1 - x - 2x^2 \\), that is, \\( 1 - x - 2x^2 = (1 + x)(1 - 2x) \\); hence \\( p = -1, q = 2 \\), and since \\( a = 1, b = -1 \\); therefore \\( P = \\frac{1}{2}, Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\), and the general term \\( (Pp^{n-1} + Qq^{n-1})x^{n-1} \\) becomes by substituting\n\n\\[ \\left\\{ \\frac{2}{3}(-1)^{n-1} + \\frac{1}{3}2^{n-1} \\right\\} x^{n-1} = \\frac{2^{n-1} - 2}{3}x^{n-1}, \\]\n\nwhere the sign \\( + \\) is to be taken when \\( n \\) is an odd number; but the sign \\( - \\) when \\( n \\) is even.\n\nSometimes the values of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) will come out imaginary quantities; these, however, will be found always to destroy one another when substituted in the general term.\n\nLet us next suppose the fraction which produces a recurring series to be\n\n\\[ \\frac{a + bx + cx^2}{1 - ax - bx^2 - yx^3}. \\]\n\nLet \\( x = \\frac{1}{p}, x = \\frac{1}{q}, x = \\frac{1}{r} \\) be the three roots of the cubic equation \\( 1 - ax - bx^2 - yx^3 = 0 \\), then the denominator of the fraction will be the product of the three factors\n\n\\[ 1 - px, 1 - qx, 1 - rx. \\]\n\nWe must now assume the fraction equal to the expression\n\n\\[ \\frac{P}{1 - px} + \\frac{Q}{1 - qx} + \\frac{R}{1 - rx}, \\]\n\nin which \\( P, Q, R \\) denote quantities which are independent of \\( x \\).\n\nThe three terms of this expression are next to be reduced to a common denominator and collected into one, and the coefficients of the powers of \\( x \\) in the numerator of the result are to be put equal to the like powers of \\( x \\) in the proposed fraction, we shall then have\nand by these equations the values of \\( P, Q, R \\) may be found.\n\nLet \\( \\frac{P}{1-px}, \\frac{Q}{1-qx}, \\frac{R}{1-rx} \\) be now resolved into series by division; then, adding the like powers of \\( x \\) in each we have\n\n\\[\n(P+Q+R)+\\left(\\frac{PP+QQ+RR}{1-p^2x^2}\\right)x+\\left(\\frac{PP^2+QQ^2+RR^2}{1-p^3x^3}\\right)x^2+\\ldots\n\\]\n\nfor the series which is the development of the fraction\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a+bx+cx^2}{1-ax-bx^2-cx^3}\n\\]\n\nand here the general term is evidently\n\n\\[\n(Pp^{n-1}+Qq^{n-1}+Rr^{n-1})x^{n-1};\n\\]\n\nand in the very same manner may the general term be found in every case in which the denominator of the fraction admits of being resolved into unequal factors.\n\n(21.) Let us now suppose the fraction to have the form \\( \\frac{a+bx}{(1-\\rho x)^2} \\), the denominator being the product of two equal factors; this fraction cannot be decomposed into other fractions, the denominators of which are the simple factors of its denominator. We may, however, transform it into two, which shall have their numerators constant quantities by proceeding as follows: Assume the numerator \\( a+bx = P+Q(1-\\rho x) \\), then, that \\( x \\) may remain indeterminate, we must have \\( P+Q=a,-\\rho Q=b \\); therefore\n\n\\[\nQ=-\\frac{b}{\\rho}, P=a+\\frac{b}{\\rho}.\n\\]\n\nThe assumption of \\( a+bx=P+Q(1-\\rho x) \\) gives us therefore\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a+bx}{(1-\\rho x)^2} = \\frac{P}{(1-\\rho x)^2} + \\frac{Q}{1-\\rho x}.\n\\]\n\nNow, putting the first term of the latter side of this equation under the form \\( P(1-\\rho x)^{-2} \\), it is resolved by the binomial theorem into the series\n\n\\[\nP(1+2\\rho x+3\\rho^2x^2+4\\rho^3x^3+\\ldots);\n\\]\n\nthe other fraction \\( \\frac{Q}{1-\\rho x} \\) being expanded into a series is\n\n\\[\nQ+Q\\rho x+Q\\rho^2x^2+\\ldots,\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the complete development of \\( \\frac{a+bx}{(1-\\rho x)^2} \\) is\n\n\\[\nP+Q+(2P+Q)\\rho x+(3P+Q)\\rho^2x^2+\\ldots,\n\\]\n\nand here the general term is manifestly\n\n\\[\n(nP+Q)\\rho^{n-1}x^{n-1},\n\\]\n\nor, substituting for \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) their values,\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{ n\\rho a+(n-1)b \\right\\}\\rho^{n-1}x^{n-1}.\n\\]\n\n(22.) In general, whatever be the form of the fraction from which a recurring series is derived, to determine the general term we must decompose the fraction into others which may be as simple as possible; and provided it be rational, and the highest power of \\( x \\) in the numerator at least one degree less than the highest power in the denominator, it may be always decomposed into others having one or other of these two forms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P}{1-px}, \\frac{Q}{(1-qx)^2},\n\\]\n\nin which expressions \\( P, Q, p, \\) and \\( q \\), denote quantities independent of \\( x \\). Each partial fraction gives a recurring series, the general term of which will be sufficiently obvious; and as the series belonging to the original fraction, is the sum of these series, so also its general term will be the sum of all their general terms.\n\nWe have now treated of some of the more general methods of summing series which admit of being explained by the common principles of algebra; but the subject is of great extent, and to treat it to as to give a tolerable notion of its various branches, would require more room than could with propriety be spared on such a work as ours.\n\n(23.) The fluxionary calculus affords a method, almost the only general one we possess, of summing series. The general principles upon which it is applied, may be stated briefly as follows. Since the fluent of any fluxion containing one variable quantity may always be expressed by a series, on the contrary every series may be regarded as the expression of a fluent; when any series then is proposed, we must endeavour to find the fluxional expression of which that series is the fluent; and as we can always find the fluent of a fluxion, at least by approximation, within given limits; we may thence determine, if not the exact, at least the approximate value of any infinite series. We shall now show how this principle may be applied in some particular cases.\n\n**Problem I.** It is proposed to find the sum of \\( n \\) terms of the series\n\n\\[\nx+2x^2+3x^3+4x^4+\\ldots+nx^n.\n\\]\n\nLet the sum be denoted by \\( s \\). Then, multiplying all the terms by \\( \\frac{x}{x} \\) we have\n\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{x} = x+2x^2+3x^3+4x^4+\\ldots+nx^n.\n\\]\n\nLet the fluent of both sides be now taken, and the result is\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{s}{x} dx = x+x^2+x^3+x^4+\\ldots+x^n.\n\\]\n\nNow the series on the right-hand side of this equation is a geometrical progression, the sum of which is known to be \\( \\frac{x-x^{n+1}}{1-x} \\) (Algebra, § 106). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{s}{x} dx = \\frac{x-x^{n+1}}{1-x},\n\\]\nSER\n\nSeries, and, taking the fluxions,\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{(n+1)x^n + nx^{n+1}}{(1-x)^2}. \\]\n\nHence we find\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{x - (n+1)x^n + nx^{n+1}}{(1-x)^2}. \\]\n\nThis result agrees with that formerly found (17.) of this article.\n\n**Problem II.** It is proposed to sum the infinite series\n\n\\[ 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{1}{11} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nWe may consider this series as a particular case of the more general series,\n\n\\[ x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^5}{5} - \\frac{x^7}{7} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nnamely, that in which \\( x = 1 \\). Putting therefore the sum \\( s = r \\), and taking the fluxions, we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = x(1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \\ldots \\text{etc.}). \\]\n\nNow the series in the parenthesis is obviously the development of the rational fraction \\( \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\) therefore,\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{x}{1+x^2}, \\text{and taking the fluent } s = \\text{arc (tan. } x\\text{)} + c, \\text{ radius being unity. (Fluxions § 60.) Now when } x = 0, \\text{ all the terms of the series vanish, so that in this case } s = 0; \\text{ and as when } x = 0, \\text{ arc (tan. } x\\text{)} = 0; \\text{ therefore } c, \\text{ the constant quantity added to complete the fluent is } 0, \\text{ and we have simply } s = \\text{arc (tan. } x\\text{)}, \\text{ and when } x = 1, \\text{ then } s = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ a quadrant } = .7853982.\n\n**Problem III.** Required the sum of the infinite series\n\n\\[ \\frac{x}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{x^2}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{x^3}{3 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{x^4}{4 \\cdot 5} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nPutting \\( s \\) for the sum, and taking the fluxions, we get\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\frac{x^5}{5} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nNow the series in the parenthesis is evidently equal to \\( -x \\cdot \\text{Nap. log. } (1-x) \\). (see Logarithms, page 76, column 1.) Therefore\n\n\\[ s = -\\frac{x}{x} - \\frac{x^2}{x^2} \\times \\text{Nap. log. } (1-x). \\]\n\nTo find the fluent, let us put \\( v \\) for the function \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\log. (1-x) \\), then, taking its fluxion we have\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = -\\frac{x}{x^2} \\times \\log. (1-x) - \\frac{x}{x(1-x)}, \\]\n\nand\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\times \\log. (1-x) = \\frac{v}{x} + \\frac{x}{x(1-x)}, \\]\n\ntherefore, substituting, we get\n\n\\[ s = v + \\frac{x}{x(1-x)} - \\frac{x}{x}. \\]\n\nSER\n\n\\[ s = v + \\frac{x}{x(1-x)}; \\]\n\nand taking the fluents,\n\n\\[ s = v - \\log. (1-x) + c \\]\n\n\\[ = \\log. \\frac{1-x}{x} - \\log. (1-x) + c. \\]\n\nTo determine the constant quantity \\( c \\), let us take \\( x = 0 \\), then, in this case all the terms of the series vanish so that \\( s = 0 \\), also \\( \\log. (1-x) = \\log. 1 = 0 \\); and since in general \\( \\log. \\frac{1-x}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}(-x^2 - \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\ldots \\text{etc.}) \\), when \\( x = 0 \\), then \\( \\log. \\frac{1-x}{x} = -1 \\); therefore \\( 0 = -1 + c \\), and \\( c = 1 \\);\n\nhence it appears that\n\n\\[ s = \\log. \\frac{1-x}{x} - \\log. (1-x) + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{(1-x) \\log. (1-x)}{x} + 1. \\]\n\n**Example.** Let \\( x = \\frac{1}{2} \\), then our formula gives\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{1 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} + \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 4} + \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 5} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\n\\[ = 1 - \\text{Nap. log. } 2 = .3068528. \\]\n\n**Problem IV.** Let the series to be summed be\n\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{m}{n} x + \\frac{m+1}{n+1} x^2 + \\frac{m+2}{n+2} x^3 + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nPutting \\( s \\) for this series let all its terms be multiplied by \\( x^{n-1} \\) so that the exponent of \\( x \\) in each may be identical with its denominator, the result is\n\n\\[ s x^{n-1} = x^{n-1} + \\frac{m}{n} x^n + \\frac{m+1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + \\frac{m+2}{n+2} x^{n+2} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nand hence taking the fluxions\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{(n-1)x^{n-2} + (n-1)x^{n-2} + mx^{n-1}}{x^{n-1}} + \\frac{(m+1)x^n + (m+2)x^{n+1}}{x^{n-1}} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nLet both sides of this equation be now multiplied by \\( x^{n-m} \\), and it becomes\n\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{(n-1)x^{n-2} + (n-1)x^{n-2} + mx^{n-1}}{x^{n-1}} + \\frac{(m+1)x^n + (m+2)x^{n+1}}{x^{n-1}} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\nPutting now the single character \\( p \\) for the fluxional expression which forms the first member of this equation, we get by taking the fluents of both sides,\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{n-1}{m-1} x^{n-1} + \\frac{m}{n} x^n + \\frac{m+1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + \\ldots \\text{etc.} \\]\n\n\\[ = \\frac{n-1}{m-1} x^{n-1} + \\frac{m}{n} (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \\ldots \\text{etc.}), \\]\n\nbut the series in the parenthesis is the development of \\( \\frac{1}{1-x} \\), therefore\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{n-1}{m-1} x^{n-1} + \\frac{m}{n} \\frac{x}{1-x}; \\]\ntaking now the fluxions, and substituting instead of \\( p \\) the expression it was put to represent, we get\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&x^{m-1} + (n-1)x^{m-2} + \\frac{mx^{m-1}}{1-x} + \\frac{x^m}{(1-x)^2}, \\\\\n&= (n-1)x^{m-2} + \\frac{mx^{m-1}}{1-x} + \\frac{x^m}{(1-x)^2},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand this, after reduction, becomes\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\frac{n-1}{x} + \\frac{(n-1)x}{x} = \\frac{(n-1)x}{x} + \\frac{mx}{1-x} + \\frac{x^m}{(1-x)^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis fluxional equation being of the first degree, and first order, its primitive equation may be found (from the general formula given in Fluxions, § 182.) to be\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{1}{x^{n-1}} \\times \\int \\left\\{ (n-1)x^{n-2} + \\frac{mx^{n-1}}{1-x} + \\frac{x^n}{(1-x)^2} \\right\\};\n\\]\n\nand this again, by remarking that \\( \\int (n-1)x^{n-2} = x^{n-1} \\),\n\nand that\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{mx^{n-1}}{1-x} = \\frac{mx^n}{n(1-x)} - \\int \\frac{mx^n}{(1-x)^2},\n\\]\n\nmay be reduced to\n\n\\[\ns = 1 + \\frac{mx}{n(1-x)} + \\frac{n-m}{nx^{n-1}} \\int \\frac{mx^n}{(1-x)^2}.\n\\]\n\nThe remaining fluent \\( \\int \\frac{mx^n}{(1-x)^2} \\) may be found by § 109.\n\nFluxions, and it must be taken, that after being multiplied by \\( \\frac{n-m}{nx^{n-1}} \\), it shall vanish when \\( x = 0 \\); for then this hypothesis will make the whole function which expresses the value of \\( s \\) vanish, except its first term \\( t \\), as it ought to do.\n\nExample. Let us suppose \\( n = 2 \\), then,\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{x^2}{(1-x)^2} = x + \\frac{x}{1-x} + 2 \\log (1-x),\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2-m}{2x} \\int \\frac{x^3}{(1-x)^2} = \\frac{(2-m)x}{2(1-x)} + \\frac{2-m}{x} \\log (1-x),\n\\]\n\nthe fluent being here taken as directed. In this case then, after collecting the terms, we get \\( s \\), or\n\n\\[\n1 + \\frac{m}{2}x + \\frac{m+1}{3}x^2 + \\frac{m+2}{4}x^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{1}{1-x} + \\frac{(2-m)}{x} \\log (1-x).\n\\]\n\n(24.) There is a branch of the doctrine of series which is of considerable importance in pure mathematics as well as in many physical inquiries, and in the science of astronomy; it is called the Interpolation of series.\n\nTo interpolate a series is to interpose among its terms others which shall be subject to the same law, or which shall be formed in the same manner as the original terms of the series; or in other words, it is to find the value of one or more terms by means of others which are given, and which may be either at equal or unequal intervals from one another; the places of the given terms as well as of those sought being supposed known.\n\nIt is easy to see that this problem may be applied to the construction of logarithmic tables; for we may regard the logarithms of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., ad infinitum as the terms of a particular series of which the numbers themselves are then the indices. Having given the logarithms of some numbers we may by interpolating deduce from them the logarithms of others.\n\nAgain, in astronomy we may consider the numbers which express the successive observed positions of a celestial body as the terms of a series, their indices being the intervals of time between the observations, and some assumed epoch, and the problem we are considering will enable us to determine the position at any instant different from the times of actual observation, provided the intervals between the observations be small, and the instant for which the position is sought not very remote from those at which the observations were made.\n\n(25.) With a view to illustrate the nature of the problem to be resolved, let us consider some particular case, as for example the arithmetical series\n\n\\[\na, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d, \\ldots\n\\]\n\nLet \\( t \\) and \\( t' \\) be two given terms of the series, which are at any distance from one another, and let \\( n \\) and \\( n' \\) be their indices, or numbers which denote their places in the series. Also let \\( y \\) be any term whatever and \\( x \\) its index. Then by the nature of an arithmetical series,\n\n\\[\nt = a + (n-1)d, \\quad t' = a + (n'-1)d,\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny = a + (x-1)d,\n\\]\n\nNow, as there are here three equations, each involving the quantities \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), we may eliminate both these quantities by the common rules, (Algebra, Sect. VII.) and this being done, we get\n\n\\[\n(n-n')(t-t') = (n-n)(y-y'),\n\\]\n\nand hence we find this expression,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{n-n'}{n-n'}t + \\frac{n-n'}{n-n'}t',\n\\]\n\nwhich is a general formula for interpolating any arithmetical series, and it is observable, that it is entirely independent both of the first term and common difference.\n\nExample. The 7th term of an arithmetical series is 15, and the 12th term is 25: It is required to find the 10th term.\n\nHere \\( n = 7, n' = 12, x = 10 \\);\n\n\\( t = 15, t' = 25; \\) \\( y \\) is sought.\n\nTherefore by the formula,\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 15 + \\frac{3}{5} \\times 25 = 21, \\text{ the answer.}\n\\]\n\n(26.) The mode of investigation by which we have found a formula for the interpolation of an arithmetical series will apply also to others, if the law according to which the terms are formed be known; in general, however, the law of a series to be interpolated is either not\nnot known, or it is not taken into account, and we only consider the absolute magnitudes of certain terms, and the numbers expressing their places in the series.\n\nTo resolve the problem generally with these data, it is usual to proceed as follows: Let a straight line, AB, and a point A in it, be assumed as given in position, and let there be taken the segments AD, AD', AD'', AD''', &c. proportional to the numbers denoting the places of the terms of a series reckoned from any term assumed as a fixed origin, and at the points D, D', D'', let there be erected perpendiculars proportional to the terms themselves. Let us now suppose a curve to pass through C, C', C'', C''', &c., then, if it be so chosen that its curvature may vary gradually in its progress from point to point, without any very abrupt changes of inflection, and moreover, if the terms (which we may suppose to be either equal or unequal distances) are pretty near to one another, it is easy to conceive, that if AP be taken equal to the number expressing the place of a term between C'D', C''D'', any two others, the term itself will, if not exactly, at least be nearly expressed by PQ, the ordinate to the curve.\n\nAs an infinite variety of curves may be found that shall pass through the same given points; in this respect the problem is unlimited; it is, however, convenient to assume such as are simple and tractable. The parabolic class possess these properties, and accordingly they are commonly employed.\n\nLet us then express the ordinates CD, C'D', C''D'', C'''D''', &c., which are the given terms of the series by \\( t, t', t'', t''', \\ldots \\), &c.\n\nand the abscissae AD, AD', AD'', AD''', or the numbers denoting the order of the terms by \\( n, n', n'', n''', \\ldots \\).\n\nPut \\( y \\) for PQ, a term to be interpolated, and \\( x \\) for AP its place. Then, considering \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) as indefinite co-ordinates, a parabolic curve that shall pass through the points C, C', C'', C''', &c. will have for its equation\n\n\\[\ny = A + Bx + Cx^2 + Dx^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n\nthe number of terms on the right-hand side being supposed equal to that of the given points, and A, B, C, &c. being put to denote constant quantities. To determine these we must consider that when \\( x = n \\), then \\( y = t \\), and that when \\( x = n' \\), then \\( y = t' \\) and so on, therefore, substituting the successive corresponding values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) we get\n\n\\[\nt = A + Bn + Cn^2 + Dn^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n\\[\nt' = A + Bn' + Cn'^2 + Dn'^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n\\[\nt'' = A + Bn'' + Cn''^2 + Dn''^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n\\[\nt''' = A + Bn''' + Cn'''^2 + Dn'''^3 + \\ldots,\n\\]\n&c.\n\nThis series of equations must be continued until their number be the same as that of the coefficient, A, B, C, D, &c. If we now consider \\( t, t', t'', \\ldots \\) and \\( n, n', n'', \\ldots \\) as known, and A, B, C, &c. as unknown quantities, we may determine these last by eliminating them one after another from the above equations, as is taught in Algebra, Sect. XVII. And the values of A, B, C, &c. being thus determined and substituted in the general equation, we shall have a general expression for \\( y \\) in terms of \\( x \\) the number denoting its place and known quantities; and this is in substance the solution originally given of the problem by Sir Isaac Newton, who proposed it in the third book of his Principia with a view to its application in astronomy.\n\nA celebrated foreign mathematician (Lagrange) has, in the Cahiers de l'Ecole Normale, given a different form to the expression for \\( y \\). He has observed that since, when \\( x \\) becomes \\( n, n', n'', n''', \\ldots \\), successively, then \\( y \\) becomes \\( t, t', t'', t''', \\ldots \\). It follows that the expression for \\( y \\) must have this form:\n\n\\[\ny = a + b't + c't'' + d't''',\n\\]\n\nwhere the quantities \\( a, b, c, d, \\ldots \\) must be such functions of \\( x \\), that if we put \\( x = n \\), then \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), &c. and if we put \\( x = n' \\), then \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), &c. and again, if we make \\( x = n'' \\), then \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 1 \\), &c. and so on. Hence it is easy to conclude that the values of \\( a, b, c, d, \\ldots \\) must have the form\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{(x-n)(x-n')(x-n'')}{(n-n')(n-n'')(n-n'')},\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\frac{(x-n)(x-n')(x-n'')}{(n-n')(n-n'')(n-n'')},\n\\]\n\\[\nc = \\frac{(x-n)(x-n')(x-n'')}{(n-n')(n-n'')(n-n'')},\n\\]\n\\[\nd = \\frac{(x-n)(x-n')(x-n'')}{(n-n')(n-n'')(n-n'')},\n\\]\n&c.\n\nand here the number of factors in the numerator and denominator must be each equal to the number of given points in the curve. This formula would be found to be identical with that which may be obtained by the method indicated in last article, if we were to take the actual product of the factors and arrange the whole expression according to powers of \\( x \\). It possesses however one advantage over the other, viz. that of admitting of the application of logarithms.\n\nWe shall now show the application of this formula.\n\nEx. 1 Having given the logarithms of 101, 102, 104, and 105, it is required to find the logarithm of 103.\n\nIn this case we may reckon the terms of the series forward from the first given term, viz. log. 101, so that we have\n\n\\[\nt = \\log. 101 = 2.0043214,\n\\]\n\\[\nt' = \\log. 102 = 2.0086002,\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\log. 103 = \\text{term sought},\n\\]\n\\[\nt'' = \\log. 104 = 2.0170333,\n\\]\n\\[\nt''' = \\log. 105 = 2.0211893,\n\\]\n\nSubstituting now in the general formula we get\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{1 \\times 1 \\times -3}{-1 \\times -3 \\times -4} = \\frac{1}{6},\n\\]\n\\[\nb = \\frac{2 \\times 1 \\times -2}{1 \\times -2 \\times -3} = \\frac{2}{3},\n\\]\n\\[\nc = \\frac{2 \\times 1 \\times -1}{4 \\times 3 \\times 1} = \\frac{1}{6},\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\( y = \\frac{t}{6} + \\frac{2t'}{3} + \\frac{2t''}{3} - \\frac{t'''}{6} \\)\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{3(t + t'')}{6} - \\frac{t'}{6} + \\frac{t'''}{6}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= 2.0128372 \\text{ the answer}.\n\\]\nEx. 2. Given a comet's distance from the sun on the following days at 12 at night, to find its distance December 20th.\n\nDecember 12. distance 301, Dec. 24. distance 715,\n21. 620, 26. 772.\n\nHere we shall estimate the places of the terms from the time of the first position, viz. December 12. Therefore\n\n\\[ t = 301, \\quad n = 0, \\]\n\\[ y \\text{ is sought}, \\quad x = 8, \\]\n\\[ t' = 620, \\quad n' = 9, \\]\n\\[ t'' = 715, \\quad n'' = 12, \\]\n\\[ t''' = 772, \\quad n''' = 14. \\]\n\nIn this case the general formula gives us\n\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{63}, \\beta = \\frac{6}{45}, \\gamma = -\\frac{2}{3}, \\delta = \\frac{8}{33}. \\]\n\nTherefore\n\n\\[ y = \\frac{t}{63} + \\frac{6t'}{45} - \\frac{2t''}{3} + \\frac{8t'''}{33}. \\]\n\n= 586.3 the answer.\n\nWe shall conclude this article with a brief enumeration of the best works on the subject which we have been treating of.\n\nArs Conjectandi, (Jac.

Lat. 12° 32' and E. Long. 96° 47', about four miles in length, by one and a half in breadth, across the middle, where it is likewise highest, whence it gradually falls and narrows towards the extremities. The west end of the island, on which there is a fort of considerable strength, slopes more, especially towards the north; and the ground rising on the opposite side of the river commands a distinct view of every part of the fort. The fort and outworks occupy about a mile of the west end of the island, and are distinguished by magnificent buildings, and ancient Hindoo pagodas, contrasted with the more lofty and splendid monuments lately raised in honour of the Mahometan faith. The great garden, called the Laul Baug, covers about as much of the east end of the island as the fort and outworks do of the west; and the whole intermediate space, except a small inclosure on the north bank near the fort, was, before the last war, filled with houses, and formed Seringapatam, an extensive suburb, of which the greatest part was destroyed by Tippoo to make room for batteries to defend the island when attacked by the combined forces of Earl Cornwallis and the Mahratta chiefs in February 1792. This suburb, or town of modern structure, is about half a mile square, divided into regular crofs streets, all wide, and shaded on each side by trees. It is surrounded by a strong mud wall, contains many good houses, and seems to have been preserved by the Sultan for the accommodation of merchants, and for the convenience of troops stationed on that part of the island for its defence. A little to the eastward of the town is the entrance to the great garden, which was laid out in regular shady walks of large cypresses trees, and abounding with fruit-trees, flowers, and vegetables of every description. It possessed all the beauty and elegance of a country retirement, and was dignified by the mausoleum of Hyder, and a superb new palace built by his son. This noble garden was devoted to destruction; and the trees which had shaded their proud master, and contributed to his pleasures, were formed into the means of protecting his enemies in subverting his empire. \"Before that event, so glorious to the arms of England, this insulated metropolis (says Major Dirom) must have been the richest, most convenient, and beautiful spot possessed in the present age by any native prince in India; but when the allies left it, the Sultan's fort and city only remained in repair amidst all the wrecks of his former grandeur, the island presenting nothing but the appearance of wretched baronets. Tippoo is a man of talents, enterprise, and great wealth; but, in the opinion of our author, the remaining years of his ill-fated life will be unequal to renew the beauties of his terrestrial paradise.\" This prediction was more than verified in the fate of Tippoo; for he lost his life in bravely defending his capital, which was taken by assault in 1799 by the British troops under General Baird. See INDIA, No. 183.\n\nSERINGHAM, an island of Indoian, formed about six miles north-west of Trichinopoly by the river Cavery, which divides itself into two branches: that to the northward takes the name of Coleroon, but the southern branch preserves its old name the Cavery. Each of these rivers, after a course of about 90 miles, empty themselves into the sea; the Coleroon at Devicottah, and the Cavery near Tranquebar, at about 20 miles distance from one another. In this island, facing Trichinopoly, stood a famous pagoda surrounded by seven square walls of stone, 25 feet high and four feet thick. The space between the outward and second walls measured 310 feet, and so proportionably of the rest. Each inclosure had four large gates, with a high tower; which were placed, one in the middle of each side of the inclosure, and opposite to the four cardinal points. The outward wall was about four miles in circumference, and its gateway to the south was ornamented with pillars, some of which were single stones 33 feet in length and five in diameter; while those that formed the roof were still larger; and in the inmost inclosure were the chapels.—About half a mile to the east was another large pagoda called Jambiliyana, which had but one inclosure.\n\nThe pagoda of Seringham was held in great veneration, from a belief that it contained the identical image\nSERINGHAM of the god Wisnou worshipped by Brama; and pilgrims came here from all parts of India with offerings of money to procure absolution. A large part of the revenue of the island was allotted for the maintenance of the Bramins who inhabited the pagoda; and these, with their families, formerly amounted to no fewer than 40,000 persons, all maintained by the superstitious liberality of the adjacent country.\n\nSERIOLA, a genus of plants belonging to the class Syngenesia, and in the natural system ranged under the 49th order, Compositae.

See OPHIOLOGY.\n\nThe serpent has been always considered the enemy of man; and it has hitherto continued to terrify and annoy him, notwithstanding all the arts which have been practised to destroy it. Formidable in itself, it deters the invader from the pursuit; and from its figure, capable of finding shelter in a little space, it is not easily discovered by those who would venture to encounter it. Thus protected at once of potent arms, and inaccessible or secure retreats, it baffles all the arts of man, though ever so carefully bent upon its destruction. For this reason, there is scarcely a country in the world that does not still give birth to this poisonous brood, that seems formed to quell human pride, and repel the boasts of security. Mankind have driven the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, from their vicinity; but the snake and the viper still defy their power.\n\nTheir numbers, however, are thinned by human fidelity; and it is possible some of the kinds are wholly destroyed. In none of the countries of Europe are they sufficiently numerous to be truly terrible. The various malignity that has been ascribed to European serpents of old is now utterly unknown; there are not above three or four kinds that are dangerous, and their poison operates in all in the same manner. The drowsy death, the starting of the blood from every pore, the inflamable and burning thirst, the melting down the solid mass of the whole form into one heap of putrefaction, said to be occasioned by the bites of African serpents, are horrors with which we are entirely unacquainted, and are perhaps only the creatures of fancy.\n\nBut though we have thus reduced these dangers, having been incapable of wholly removing them, in other parts of the world they still rage with all their ancient malignity. In the warm countries that lie within the tropics, as well as in the cold regions of the north, where the inhabitants are few, the serpents propagate in equal proportion. But of all countries those regions have them in the greatest abundance where the fields are uncropped and fertile, and where the climate supplies warmth and humidity. All along the swampy banks of the river Niger or Orinoco, where the sun is hot, the forests thick, and the men but few, the serpents cling among the branches of the trees in infinite numbers, and carry on an unceasing war against all other animals in their vicinity. Travellers have assured us, that they have often seen large snakes twining round the trunk of a tall tree, encompassing it like a wreath, and thus rising and descending at pleasure.—We are not, therefore, to reject as wholly fabulous the accounts left us by the ancients of the terrible devastations committed by a single serpent. It is probable, in early times, when the arts were little known, and mankind were but thinly scattered over the earth, that serpents, continuing undisturbed possessors of the forest, grew to an amazing magnitude; and every other tribe of animals fell before them. It then might have happened, that serpents reigned the tyrants of a district for centuries together. To animals of this kind, grown by time and capacity to 100 or 150 feet in length, the lion, the tiger, and even the elephant itself, were but feeble opponents. That horrible factor, which even the commonest and the most harmless snakes are still found to diffuse, might, in these larger ones, become too powerful for any living being to withstand; and while they preyed without distinction, they might thus also have poisoned the atmosphere around them. In this manner, having for ages lived in the hidden and unpeopled forest, and finding, as their appetites were more powerful, the quantity of their prey decreasing, it is possible they might venture boldly from their retreats into the more cultivated parts of the country, and carry conflagration among mankind, as they had before defoliation among the lower ranks of nature. We have many histories of antiquity, presenting us such a picture, and exhibiting a whole nation sinking under the ravages of a single serpent. At that time man had not learned the art of uniting the efforts of many to effect one great purpose. Opposing multitudes only added new victims to the general calamity, and increased mutual embarrassment and terror. The animal was therefore to be singly opposed by him who had the greatest strength, the best armour, and the most undaunted courage. In such an encounter, hundreds must have fallen; till one, more lucky than the rest, by a fortunate blow, or by taking the monster in its torpid interval, and furnished with spoil, might kill, and thus rid his country...\nSerpent, country of the destroyer. Such was the original occupation of heroes; and those who first obtained that name, from their destroying the ravagers of the earth, gained it much more deservedly than their successors, who acquired their reputation only for their skill in destroying each other. But as we descend into more enlightened antiquity, we find these animals less formidable, as being attacked in a more successful manner.\n\nWe are told, that while Regulus led his army along the banks of the river Bagrada in Africa, an enormous serpent disputed his passage over. We are assured by Pliny, that it was 120 feet long, and that it had destroyed many of the army. At last, however, the battering engines were brought out against it; and these afflicting it at a distance, it was soon destroyed. Its spoils were carried to Rome, and the general was decreed an ovation for his success. There are, perhaps, few facts better ascertained in history than this: an ovation was a remarkable honour; and was given only for some signal exploit that did not deserve a triumph: no historian would offer to invent that part of the story at least, without being subject to the most shameful detection.\n\nThe skin was kept for several years after in the Capitol; and Pliny says he saw it there. At present, indeed, such ravages from serpents are scarcely seen in any part of the world; but not that, in Africa and America, some of them are powerful enough to brave the assaults of men to this day.\n\n—Nequeunt expleri corda tuendo\nTerritibus oculos, vulturn villofaque fetis\nPectora.—Virgil.\n\nWe have given a place to the preceding remarks, not so much for their accuracy as to show what were formerly the sentiments of mankind concerning this tribe of animals.\n\n**SERPENT**, a musical instrument, serving as a bass to the cornet, or **small fiorum**, to sustain a chorus of fingers in a large edifice. It has its name **serpent** from its figure, as consisting of several folds or wreaths, which serve to reduce its length, which would otherwise be six or seven feet.\n\nIt is usually covered with leather, and consists of three parts, a mouth-piece, a neck, and a tail. It has six holes, by means whereof it takes in the compass of two octaves.\n\nMerennus, who has particularly described this instrument, mentions some peculiar properties of it, e.g., that the sound of it is strong enough to drown 20 robust voices, being animated merely by the breath of a boy, and yet the sound of it may be attuned to the softness of the sweetest voice. Another peculiarity of this instrument is, that great as the distance between the third and fourth hole appears, yet whether the third hole be open or shut, the difference is but a tone.\n\n**SERPENT**, in Mythology, was a very common symbol of the sun, and he is represented biting his tail, and with his body formed into a circle, in order to indicate the ordinary course of this luminary, and under this form it was an emblem of time and eternity. The serpent was also the symbol of medicine, and of the gods which presided over it, as of Apollo and Æsculapius; and this animal was the object of very ancient and general worship, under various appellations and characters.\n\nIn most of the ancient rites we find some allusion to the serpent, under the several titles of Ob, Opes, Python, &c. This idolatry is alluded to by Moses (Lev. xx. 27). The woman at Endor who had a familiar spirit is called Oub, or Ob, and it is interpreted Pythonia. The place where she resided, says the learned Mr Bryant, seems to have been named from the worship then instituted; for Endor is compounded of En-ador, and signifies fons Pythonis, \"the fountain of light,\" the oracle of the god Ador, which oracle was probably founded by the Canaanites, and had never been totally suppressed. His pillar was also called Abhadir, or Abadir, compounded of ab and adir, and meaning the serpent deity Addir, the same as Adorus.\n\nIn the orgies of Bacchus, the persons who partook of the ceremony used to carry serpents in their hands, and with horrid screams call upon Eva! Eva! Eva!, being, according to the writer just mentioned, the same as epha, or opha, which the Greeks rendered ophis, and by it denoted a serpent. These ceremonies and this symbolic worship began among the Magi, who were the sons of Chus; and by them they were propagated in various parts. Wherever the Ammonians founded any places of worship, and introduced their rites, there was generally some story of a serpent. There was a legend about a serpent at Colchis, at Thebes, and at Delphi; and likewise in other places. The Greeks called Apollo himself Python, which is the same as Opis, Oupis, and Oub.\n\nIn Egypt there was a serpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as very sacred; and the natives are said to have made use of it as a royal tiara, with which they ornamented the statues of Isis. The kings of Egypt wore high bonnets, terminating in a round ball, and surrounded with figures of apes; and the priests likewise had the representation of serpents upon their bonnets.\n\nAbaddon, or Abaddon, mentioned in the Revelations xx. 2, is supposed by Mr Bryant to have been the name of the Ophite god, with whose worship the world had been so long infected. This worship began among the people of Chaldea, who built the city of Ophis upon the Tigris, and were greatly addicted to divination, and to the worship of the serpent. From Chaldea the worship passed into Egypt, where the serpent deity was called Canoph, Cain-eph, and Cneph. It had also the name of Ob or Oub, and was the same as the Basiliscus or royal serpent, the same as the Thermuthis, and made use of by way of ornament to the statues of their gods. The chief deity of Egypt is said to have been Vulcan, who was styled Opas. He was the same as Osiris, the Sun, and hence was often called Ob-el, or Pytho-fol, and there were pillars sacred to him, with curious hieroglyphical inscriptions bearing the same name; whence among the Greeks, who copied from the Egyptians, every thing gradually tapering to a point was styled obelos, or obeliscus.\n\nAs the worship of the serpent began among the sons of Chus, Mr Bryant conjectures, that from thence they were denominated Ethiopians and Aithiopians, from Ath-ope or Ath-opes, the god whom they worshipped, and not from their complexion: the Ethiopes brought these rites into Greece, and called the island where they first established them, Elopia, Solis Serpentis insula, the same with Eubea, or Oubaia, i.e., \"the serpent island.\"\nThe same learned writer discovers traces of the serpent worship among the Hyperboreans, at Rhodes, named Ophiuia, in Phrygia, and upon the Hellepont, in the island Cyprus, in Crete, among the Athenians, in the name of Cerops, among the natives of Thebes in Boeotia, among the Lacedemonians, in Italy, in Syria, &c., and in the names of many places, as well as of the people where the Ophites settled. One of the most early heresies introduced into the Christian church was that of the Ophite. Bryant's Analysis of Ancient Mythology, vol. i. p. 43, &c. p. 473, &c.\n\nSERPENT Stones.

He acquired the Greek and Latin languages at Lausanne, and devoted himself to the study of the philosophy of Aristotle and Plato. On his return to France he studied divinity. He began to dithyramb himself in 1572 by his writings, but was obliged to forsake his country after the dreadful massacre of St Bartholomew. He became minister of Nîmes in 1582, but was never regarded as a very zealous Calvinist; he has even been suspected, though without reason, of having actually abjured the Protestant religion. He was one of the four clergymen whom Henry IV. consulted about the Roman religion, and who returned for answer, that Catholics might be saved. He wrote afterwards a treatise in order to reconcile the two communions, entitled De fide Catholica, jure de principiis religiosis Christianae, communi omnium Christianorum consensu, semper et ubique ratis. This work was disliked by the Catholics, and received with such indignation by the Calvinists of Geneva, that many writers have affirmed that they poisoned the author. It is certain at least that he died at Geneva in 1598, at the age of 50. His principal works are, 1. A Latin translation of Plato, published by Henry Stephens, which owes much of its reputation to the elegance of the Greek copy which accompanies it. 2. A Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul. 3. De statu religionis et republicae in Francia. 4. Memoire de la 3me guerre civile et derniers troubles de France sous Charles IX. &c. 5. Inventaire général de l'Histoire de France, illustré par la conférence de l'Eglise et de l'Empire, &c. 6. Recueil de chosé memorable avénue en France sous Henri II. François II. Charles IX. Henri III. These three historical treatises have been justly accused of partiality and passion; faults which it is next to impossible for a contemporary writer to avoid, especially if he bore any part in the transactions which he describes. His style is exceedingly incorrect and inelegant; his mistakes too and misstatements of facts are very numerous.\n\nSERRATED, in general, something indented or notched in the manner of a saw; a term much used in the description of the leaves of plants.

He rendered himself famous by his exquisite taste in architecture, and by his genius for decorations, fetes, and building. He was employed and rewarded by most of the princes in Europe. He was honoured in Portugal with the order of Christ: In France he was architect and painter to the king, and member of the different academies established for the advancement of these arts. He received the same titles from the kings of Britain, Spain, Poland, and from the duke of Württemberg. Notwithstanding these advantages, his want of economy was so great, that he left nothing behind him. He died at Paris in 1766. Paris is indebted to him for many of its ornaments. He made decorations for the theatres of London and Dresden. The French king's theatre, called la salle des Machines, was under his management for some time. He was permitted to exhibit some shows consisting of simple decorations: Some of these were astonishingly sublime; his \"Defeat of Æneas into Hell\" in particular, and his \"Enchanted Forest,\" are well known. He built and embellished a theatre at Chambor for Marechal Saxe; and furnished the plan and the model of the theatre royal at Dresden. His genius for fetes was remarkable; he had the management of a great number in Paris, and even in London. He conducted one\nServandoni, one at Lisbon given an account of a victory gained by the duke of Cumberland. He was employed frequently by the king of Portugal, to whom he presented several elegant plans and models. The prince of Wales, too, father to the present king, engaged him in his service; but the death of that prince prevented the execution of the designs which had been projected. He presided at the magnificent fête given at Vienna on account of the marriage of the archduke Joseph and the Infanta of Parma. But it would be endless to attempt an enumeration of all his performances and exhibitions.\n\nSERVANT, a term of relation, signifying a person who owes and pays obedience for a certain time to another in quality of a master.\n\nAs to the several sorts of servants: It was observed, under the article LIBERTY, that pure and proper slavery does not, nay cannot, subsist in Britain: such we mean whereby an absolute and unlimited power is given to the master over the life and fortune of the slave. And indeed it is repugnant to reason, and the principles of natural law, that such a state should subsist anywhere. See SLAVERY.\n\nThe law of England therefore abhors, and will not endure, the existence of slavery within this nation: so that when an attempt was made to introduce it, by statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 3. which ordained, that all idle vagabonds should be made slaves, and fed upon bread, water, or small drink, and refuse-meat; should wear a ring of iron round their necks, arms, or legs; and should be compelled, by beating, chaining, or otherwise, to perform the work assigned them, were it ever so vile; the spirit of the nation could not brook this condition, even in the most abandoned rogues; and therefore this statute was repealed in two years afterwards. And now it is laid down, that a slave or negro, the instant he lands in Britain, becomes a freeman; that is, the law will protect him in the enjoyment of his person and his property. Yet, with regard to any right which the master may have lawfully acquired to the perpetual service of John or Thomas, this will remain exactly in the same state as before: for this is no more than the same state of subjection for life which every apprentice submits to for the space of seven years, or sometimes for a longer term. Hence, too, it follows, that the infamous and unchristian practice of withholding baptism from negro-servants, lest they should thereby gain their liberty, is totally without foundation, as well as without excuse. The law of England acts upon general and extensive principles: it gives liberty, rightly understood, that is, protection, to a Jew, a Turk, or a Heathen, as well as to those who profess the true religion of Christ; and it will not dissolve a civil obligation between master and servant, on account of the alteration of faith in either of the parties; but the slave is entitled to the same protection in England before as after baptism; and, whatever service the Heathen negro owed of right to his American master, by general, not by local law, the same (whatever it be) is he bound to render when brought to England and made a Christian.\n\n1. The first sort of servants, therefore, acknowledged by the laws of England, are menial servants; so called from being intra mania, or domestics. The contract between them and their masters arises upon the hiring. If the hiring be general, without any particular time limited, the law construes it to be a hiring for a year; Servant: upon a principle of natural equity, that the servant shall serve and the master maintain him, throughout all the revolutions of the respective seasons; as well when there is work to be done, as when there is not: but the contract may be made for any larger or smaller term. All single men between 12 years old and 60, and married ones under 30 years of age, and all single women between 12 and 40, not having any visible livelihood, are compellable by two justices to go out to service in husbandry or certain specific trades, for the promotion of honest industry; and no master can put away his servant, or servant leave his master, after being so retained, either before or at the end of his term, without a quarter's warning; unless upon reasonable cause, to be allowed by a justice of the peace: but they may part by consent, or make a special bargain.\n\n2. Another species of servants are called apprentices, (from apprendre, to learn); and are usually bound for a term of years, by deed indented or indentures, to serve their masters, and be maintained and instructed by them. This is usually done to persons of trade, in order to learn their art and mystery; and sometimes very large sums are given with them as a premium for such their instruction: but it may be done to husbandmen, nay, to gentlemen and others. And children of poor persons may be apprenticed out by the overseers, with consent of two justices, till 24 years of age, to such persons as are thought fitting; who are also compellable to take them: and it is held, that gentlemen of fortune, and clergymen, are equally liable with others to such compulsion: for which purposes our statutes have made the indentures obligatory, even though such parish-apprentice be a minor. Apprentices to trades may be discharged on reasonable cause, either at the request of themselves or masters, at the quarter-feastings, or by one justice, with appeal to the sessions; who may, by the equity of the statute, if they think it reasonable, direct restitution of a rateable share of the money given with the apprentice: and parish-apprentices may be discharged in the same manner by two justices. But if an apprentice, with whom less than 10-pounds hath been given, runs away from his master, he is compellable to serve out his time of absence, or make satisfaction for the same, at any time within seven years after the expiration of his original contract. See APPRENTICE and APPRENTICESHIP.\n\n3. A third species of servants are labourers, who are only hired by the day or the week, and do not live intra mania, as part of the family; concerning whom the statutes before cited have made many very good regulations; 1. Directing that all persons who have no visible effects may be compelled to work; 2. Defining how long they must continue at work in summer and in winter; 3. Punishing such as leave or desert their work; 4. Empowering the justices at sessions, or the sheriff of the county, to settle their wages; and, 5. Inflicting penalties on such as either give or exact more wages than are so settled.\n\n4. There is yet a fourth species of servants, if they may be so called, being rather in a superior, a ministerial, capacity; such as stewards, factors, and bailiffs; whom, however, the law considers as servants pro tempore, with regard to such of their acts as affect their master's or employer's property.\nAs to the manner in which this relation affects the matter, the servant himself, or third parties, see the article MASTER and Servant.\n\nFor the condition of servants by the law of Scotland, see LAW.\n\nSERVETISTS, a name given to the modern Antitrinitarians, from their being supposed to be the followers of Michael Servetus; who, in the year 1553, was burnt at Geneva, together with his books.\n\nSERVETUS, MICHAEL, a learned Spanish physician, was born at Villanueva, in Arragon, in 1529. He was sent to the university of Toulouse to study the civil law. The Reformation, which had awakened the most polished nations of Europe, directed the attention of thinking men to the errors of the Roman church and to the study of the Scriptures. Among the rest Servetus applied to this study. From the love of novelty, or the love of truth, he carried his inquiries far beyond the other reformers, and not only renounced the false opinions of the Roman Catholics, but went so far as to question the doctrine of the Trinity. Accordingly, after spending two or three years at Toulouse, he determined to go into Germany to propagate his new opinions, where he could do it with most safety. At Basil he had some conferences with Oecolampadius. He went next to Strasbourg to visit Bucer and Capito, two eminent reformers of that town. From Strasbourg he went to Huguenau, where he printed a book, entitled De Trinitatis Erroribus, in 1531. The ensuing year he published two other treatises on the same subject: in an advertisement to which, he informs the reader that it was not his intention to retract any of his former sentiments, but only to state them in a more distinct and accurate manner. To these two publications he had the courage to put his name, not suspecting that in age when liberty of opinion was granted, the exercise of that liberty would be attended with danger. After publishing these books, he left Germany, probably finding his doctrines not so cordially received as he expected. He went first to Basil, and thence to Lyons, where he lived two or three years. He then removed to Paris, where he studied medicine under Sylvius, Fernelius, and other professors, and obtained the degree of master of arts and doctor of medicine. His love of controversy involved him in a serious dispute with the physicians of Paris; and he wrote an Apology, which was suppressed by an edict of the Parliament. The misunderstanding which this dispute produced with his colleagues, and the chagrin which so unfavourable a termination occasioned, made him leave Paris in disgust. He settled two or three years in Lyons, and engaged with the Frellons, eminent printers of that age, as a corrector to their press. At Lyons he met with Pierre Palmier, the archbishop of Vienne, with whom he had been acquainted at Paris. That prelate, who was a great encourager of learned men, pressed him to accompany him to Vienne, offering him at the same time an apartment in his palace. Servetus accepted the offer, and might have lived a tranquil and happy life at Vienne, if he could have confined his attention to medicine and literature. But the love of controversy, and an eagerness to establish his opinions, always possessed him. At this time Calvin was at the head of the reformed church at Geneva. With Servetus he had been acquainted at Paris, and had there opposed his opinions. For 16 years Calvin kept up a correspondence with him, endeavouring to reclaim him from his errors. Servetus had read the works of Calvin, but did not think they merited the high eulogies of the reformers, nor were they sufficient to convince him of his errors. He continued, however, to consult him; and for this purpose sent from Lyons to Geneva three questions, which respected the divinity of Jesus Christ, regeneration, and the necessity of baptism. To these Calvin returned a civil answer. Servetus treated the answer with contempt, and Calvin replied with warmth. From reasoning he had recourse to abusive language; and this produced a polemical hatred, the most implacable disposition in the world. Calvin having obtained some of Servetus's papers, by means, it is said, not very honourable, sent them to Vienne along with the private letters which he had received in the course of their correspondence. The consequence was, that Servetus was arrested; but having escaped from prison, he resolved to retire to Naples, where he hoped to practice medicine with the same reputation which he had so long enjoyed at Vienne. He imprudently took his route through Geneva, though he could not but know that Calvin was his mortal enemy. Calvin informed the magistrates of his arrival; Servetus was apprehended, and appointed to stand trial for heresy and blasphemy. It was a law at Geneva, that every accuser should surrender himself a prisoner, that if the charge should be found false, the accuser should suffer the punishment in which he meant to involve the accused. Calvin not choosing to go to prison himself, sent one of his domestics to present the impeachment against Servetus. The articles brought against him were collected from his writings with great care; an employment which took up three days. One of these articles was, \"that Servetus had denied that Judaea was a beautiful, rich, and fertile country; and affirmed, on the authority of travellers, that it was poor, barren, and disagreeable.\" He was also charged with \"corrupting the Latin Bible, which he was employed to correct at Lyons, by introducing impertinent, trifling, whimsical, and impious notes of his own throughout every page.\" But the main article, which was certainly fatal to him, was, \"that in the person of Mr Calvin, minister of the word of God in the church of Geneva, he had defamed the doctrine that is preached, uttering all imaginable injurious, blasphemous words against it.\"\n\nCalvin visited Servetus in prison, and had frequent conferences with him: but finding that, in opposition to all the arguments he could employ, the prisoner remained inflexible in his opinions, he left him to his fate. Before sentence was passed, the magistrates of Geneva consulted the ministers of Bale, of Bern, and Zurich; and, as another account informs us, the magistrates of the Protestant Cantons of Switzerland. And to enable them to form a judgment of the criminality of Servetus, they transmitted the writings of Calvin, with his answers. The general opinion was, that Servetus ought to be condemned to death for blasphemy. He was accordingly sentenced to be burnt alive on the 27th of October 1553. As he continued alive in the midst of the flames more than two hours, it is said, finding his torment thus prolonged, he exclaimed, \"Unhappy wretch that I am! Will the flames be insufficient to terminate my misery! What then? Will the hundred pieces of gold, and the rich collar which they took from me,\"\nme, not purchase wood enough to consume me more quickly! \" Though the sentence of death was passed against Servetus by the magistrates of Geneva, with the approbation of a great number of the magistrates and ministers of Switzerland, yet it is the opinion of most historians that this dreadful sentence was imposed at the instigation of Calvin. This act of severity for holding a speculative opinion, however erroneous and absurd, has left a stain on the character of this illustrious reformer, which will attend the name of Calvin as long as history shall preserve it from oblivion. The address and art which he used in apprehending Servetus, his inhumanity to him during his trial, his disimulation and malice after his condemnation, prove that he was as much influenced by personal hatred as by a desire to support the interest of religion, though probably, during the trial, Calvin believed he was performing a very pious action. This intolerant spirit of Calvin and the magistrates of Geneva gave the Roman Catholics a favourable opportunity to accuse the Protestants of insufficiency in their principles, which they did not fail to embrace. \"How could the magistrates (says the author of the Dictionnaire des Hérétiques), who acknowledged no infallible interpretation of the Scriptures, condemn Servetus to death because he explained them differently from Calvin; since every man has the privilege to expound the Scripture, according to his own judgment, without having recourse to the church? It is a great injustice to condemn a man because he will not submit to the judgment of an enthusiast, who may be wrong as well as himself.\"\n\nServetus was a man of great acuteness and learning, and well versed in the arts and sciences. In his own profession his genius exerted itself with success. In his tract entitled Christianisme Refutatione, published in 1553, he remarks, that the whole mass of blood passes through the lungs by the pulmonary artery and vein, in opposition to the opinion which was then universally entertained, that the blood passes through the partition which divides the two ventricles. This was an important step towards the discovery of the circulation of the blood.\n\nHis works consist of Controversial Writings concerning the Trinity; an edition of Pagninus's Version of the Bible, with a preface and notes, published under the name of Michael Villanovanus; an Apology to the Physicians of Paris; and a book entitled Ratio Syruporum. Moheim has written in Latin a History of the Heresy and Misfortunes of Servetus, which was published at Helmstadt, in 4to, in 1728. From the curious details which it gives it is extremely interesting.\n\nSERVIA, a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by the rivers Danube and Save, which separate it from Hungary; on the east, by Bulgaria; on the west, by Bosnia; and on the south, by Albania and Macedonia. It is about 190 miles in length from east to west; 95 in breadth from north to south; and is divided into four pachalicates. Two of these were ceded to the Christians in 1718, who united them into one. This continued till 1739, when the Turks were victorious; and then they were abandoned to the Turks by the treaty of Belgrade. Belgrade is the capital town.\n\nSERVICE, in Law, is a duty which a tenant, on account of his fee, owes to his lord.\n\nThere are many divisions of services; as, 1. Into personal, where something is to be done by the tenant in person, as homage and fealty. 2. Real, such as wards, marriages, &c. 3. Accidental, including riots, reliefs, and the like. 4. Entire, where, on the alienation of any part of the lands by a tenant, the services become multiplied. 5. Frank-service, which was performed by freemen, who were not obliged to perform any bale service, but only to find a man and horse to attend the lord into the army or to court. 6. Knight's service, by which lands were anciently held of the king, on paying homage, service in war, &c.\n\nAs in every free and well regulated society there must be a diversity of ranks, there must be a great number of persons employed in service, both in agriculture and domestic affairs. In this country, service is a contract into which the servant voluntarily enters; and the master's authority extends no farther than to the performance of that species of labour for which the agreement was made.\n\n\"The treatment of servants (says that respectable moralist Mr Paley), as to diet, discipline, and accommodation, the kind and quantity of work to be required of them, the intermission, liberty, and indulgence to be allowed them, must be determined in a great measure by custom; for where the contract involves so many particulars, the contracting parties express a few perhaps of the principal, and by mutual understanding refer the rest to the known custom of the country in like cases.\n\n\"A servant is not bound to obey the unlawful commands of his master; to minister, for instance, to his unlawful pleasures; or to assist him in unlawful practices in his profession; as in smuggling or adulterating the articles which he deals in. For the servant is bound by nothing but his own promise; and the obligation of a promise extends not to things unlawful.\n\n\"For the same reason, the master's authority does not justify the servant in doing wrong; for the servant's own promise, upon which that authority is founded, would be none.\n\n\"Clerks and apprentices ought to be employed entirely in the profession or trade which they are intended to learn. Instruction is their wages; and to deprive them of the opportunities of instruction, by taking up their time with occupations foreign to their business, is to defraud them of their wages.\n\n\"The master is responsible for what a servant does in the ordinary course of his employment; for it is done under a general authority committed to him, which is in justice equivalent to a specific direction. Thus, if I pay money to a banker's clerk, the banker is accountable; but not if I had paid it to his butler or his footman, whose business it is not to receive money. Upon the same principle, if I once send a servant to take up goods upon credit, whatever goods he afterwards takes up at the same shop, so long as he continues in my service, are justly chargeable to my account.\n\n\"The law of this country goes great lengths in intending a kind of concurrence in the matter, so as to charge him with the consequences of his servants' conduct. If an innkeeper's servant rob his guests, the innkeeper must make restitution; if a farrier's servant lame your horse, the farrier must answer for the damage;\nService. mage; and still farther, if your coachman or carter drive over a passenger in the road, the passenger may recover from you a satisfaction for the hurt he suffers. But these determinations stand, I think, rather upon the authority of the law, than any principle of natural justice.\"\n\nThere is a grievance which has long and justly been complained of, the giving of good characters to bad servants. This is perhaps owing to carelessness, to a desire of getting rid of a bad servant, or to mistaken compassion. But such carelessness is inexcusable. When a man gives his sanction to the character of a bad servant, he ought to reflect on the nature and consequences of what he is doing. He is giving his name to a falsehood; he is deceiving the honest man who confides in his veracity; and he is deliberately giving a knave an opportunity of cheating an honest man. To endeavour to get quit of a bad servant in this way, is surely not less criminal than concealing the faults and disadvantages of an estate which is advertised for sale, and ascribing to it advantages which it does not possess. In this case, we know the sale would be reduced, and the advertiser disgraced. Many masters give characters to servants out of compassion; but it is to this mistaken compassion that the disorderly behaviour of servants is perhaps principally owing: for if the punishment of dishonesty be only a change of place (which may be, a reward instead of a punishment), it ceases to be a servant's interest to be true to his trust.\n\nWe have said above that a master's authority over his servant extends no farther than the terms of contract; by which we meant, that a master could give no unreasonable orders to his servant, or such as was inconsistent with the terms of contract. But the relation between a master and servant is certainly closer than the mere terms of a contract: it is a moral as well as a legal relation. A master of a family ought to superintend the morals of his servants, and to restrain them from vices. This he may do by his example, by his influence, and authority. Indeed every man possessed of authority is guilty of criminal negligence if he does not exert his authority for promoting virtue in his inferiors; and no authority is so well adapted for this purpose as that of masters of families, because none operates with an influence so immediate and constant. It is wonderful how much good a nobleman or gentleman of fortune can do to his domestics by attending to their morals; and every master may be a blessing to individuals and to society, by exerting prudently that influence which his situation gives him over the conduct of his servant.\n\nChoral SERVICE, in church-history, denotes that part of religious worship which consists in chanting and singing. The advocates for the high antiquity of singing, as a part of church-music, urge the authority of St Paul in its favour (Ephes. chap. v. ver. 19. and Col. chap. iii. ver. 16.). On the authority of which passages it is asserted, that songs and hymns were, from the establishment of the church, sung in the assemblies of the faithful; and it appears from undoubted testimony, that singing, which was practised as a sacred rite among the Egyptians and Hebrews, at a very early period, and which likewise constituted a considerable part of the religious ceremonies of the Greeks and Romans, made a part of the religious worship of Christians, not only before churches were built, and their religion established by law, but from the first profession of Christianity. However, the era from whence others have dated the introduction of music into the service of the church, is that period during which Leontius governed the church of Antioch, i.e., between the year of Christ 347 and 356. See ANTIPHONY.\n\nFrom Antioch the practice soon spread through the other churches of the East; and in a few ages after its first introduction into divine service, it not only received the sanction of public authority, but those were forbidden to join in it who were ignorant of music. A canon to this purpose was made by the council of Laodicea, which was held about the year 372; and Zonaras informs us, that these canonical fingers were reckoned a part of the clergy. Singing was introduced into the western churches by St Ambrose about the year 374, who was the instigator of the Ambrosian chant established at Milan about the year 386; and Eusebius (lib. ii. cap. 17.) tells us, that a regular choir, and method of singing the service, were first established, and hymns used, in the church at Antioch, during the reign of Constantine, and that St Ambrose, who had long resided there, had his melodies thence. This was about 230 years afterwards amended by Pope Gregory the Great, who established the Gregorian chant; a plain, unisonous kind of melody, which he thought consistent with the gravity and dignity of the service to which it was to be applied. This prevails in the Roman church even at this day: it is known in Italy by the name of canto fermo; in France by that of plain chant; and in Germany and most other countries by that of the cantus Gregorianus. Although no satisfactory account has been given of the specific difference between the Ambrosian and Gregorian chants, yet all writers on this subject agree in saying, that St Ambrose only used the four authentic modes, and that the four plagal were afterwards added by St Gregory. Each of these had the same final, or key-note, as its relative authentic; from which there is no other difference, than that the melodies in the four authentic or principal modes are generally confined within the compass of the eight notes above the key-note, and those in the four plagal or relative modes, within the compass of eight notes below the fifth of the key. See MODE.\n\nEcclesiastical writers seem unanimous in allowing that Pope Gregory, who began his pontificate in 590, collected the musical fragments of such ancient psalms and hymns as the first fathers of the church had approved and recommended to the first Christians; and that he selected, methodized, and arranged them in the order which was long continued at Rome, and soon adopted by the chief part of the western church. Gregory is also said to have banished from the church the cancio figurato, as too light and dissolute; and it is added, that his own chant was called canto jere me, from its gravity and simplicity.\n\nIt has been long a received opinion, that the ecclesiastical tones were taken from the reformed modes of Ptolemy; but Dr Burney observes, that it is difficult to discover any connection between them, except in their names; for their number, upon examination, is not the same: those of Ptolemy being seven, the ecclesiastical eight; and indeed the Greek names given to\nthe ecclesiastical modes do not agree with those of Ptolemy in the single instance of key, but with those of higher antiquity. From the time of Gregory to that of Guido, there was no other distinction of keys than that of authentic and plagal; nor were any semitones used but those from E to F, B to C, and occasionally A to B.\n\nWith respect to the music of the primitive church, it may be observed, that though it consisted in the singing of psalms and hymns, yet it was performed in many different ways; sometimes the psalms were sung by one person alone, whilst the rest attended in silence; sometimes they were sung by the whole assembly; sometimes alternately, the congregation being divided into separate choirs; and sometimes by one person, who repeated the first part of the verse, the rest joining in the close of it. Of the four different methods of singing now recited, the second and third were properly distinguished by the names of symphony and antiphony; and the latter was sometimes called responsaria, in which women were allowed to join. St Ignatius, who, according to Socrates (lib. vi. cap. 8.), conversed with the apostles, is generally supposed to have been the first who suggested to the primitive Christians in the East the method of singing hymns and psalms alternately, or in dialogues; and the custom soon prevailed in every place where Christianity was established; though Theodoret in his history (lib. ii. cap. 24.) tells us, that this manner of singing was first practised at Antioch. It likewise appears, that almost from the time when music was first introduced into the service of the church, it was of two kinds, and consisted in a gentle inflection of the voice, which they termed plain song, and a more elaborate and artificial kind of music, adapted to the hymns and solemn offices contained in its ritual; and this distinction has been maintained even to the present day.\n\nAlthough we find a very early distinction made between the manner of singing the hymns and chanting the psalms, it is, however, the opinion of the learned Martini, that the music of the first five or six ages of the church consisted chiefly in a plain and simple chant of unisons and octaves, of which many fragments are still remaining in the canto fermo of the Roman missals. For with respect to music in parts, as it does not appear, in these early ages, that either the Greeks or Romans were in possession of harmony or counterpoint, which has been generally ascribed to Guido, a monk of Arezzo in Tuscany, about the year 1022, though others have traced the origin of it to the eighth century, it is in vain to seek it in the church. The choral music, which had its rise in the church of Antioch, and from thence spread through Greece, Italy, France, Spain, and Germany, was brought into Britain by the fingers who accompanied Austin the monk, when he came over, in the year 596, charged with a commission to convert the inhabitants of this country to Christianity. Bede tells us, that when Austin and the companions of his mission had their first audience of King Ethelbert, in the Isle of Thanet, they approached him in procession, singing litanies; and that afterwards, when they entered the city of Canterbury, they sang a litany, and at the end of it Alleluia. But though this was the first time the Anglo-Saxons had heard the Gregorian chant, yet Bede likewise tells us, that our British ancestors had been instructed in the rites and ceremonies of the Gallican church by St Germanus, and heard him sing Alleluia many years before the arrival of St Austin. In 685, John, praepositor of St Peter's in Rome, was sent over by Pope Agatho to instruct the monks of Weremouth in the art of singing; and he was prevailed upon to open schools for teaching music in other places in Northumberland. Benedict Bishop, the preceptor of Bede, Adrian the monk, and many others, contributed to disseminate the knowledge of the Roman chant. At length the successors of St Gregory, and of Austin his missionary, having established a school for ecclesiastical music at Canterbury, the rest of the island was furnished with masters from that seminary. The choral service was first introduced in the cathedral church of Canterbury; and till the arrival of Theodore, and his settlement in that see, the practice of it seems to have been confined to the churches of Kent; but after that, it spread over the whole kingdom; and we meet with records of very ample endowments for the support of this part of public worship. This mode of religious worship prevailed in all the European churches till the time of the Reformation: the first deviation from it is that which followed the Reformation by Luther, who, being himself a lover of music, formed a liturgy, which was a musical service, contained in a work entitled Psalmodia, h. e. Cantica sacra Veteris Ecclesiae selecta, printed at Nuremberg in 1553, and at Wittenberg in 1561. But Calvin, in his establishment of a church at Geneva, reduced the whole of divine service to prayer, preaching, and singing; the latter of which he restrained. He excluded the offices of the antiphon, hymn, and motet, of the Roman service, with that artificial and elaborate music to which they were sung; and adopted only that plain metrical psalmody, which is now in general use among the reformed churches, and in the parochial churches of our own country. For this purpose he made use of Marot's version of the Psalms, and employed a musician to set them to easy tunes only of one part. In 1553, he divided the Psalms into pauses or small portions, and appointed them to be sung in churches. Soon after they were bound up with the Geneva catechism; from which time the Catholics, who had been accustomed to sing them, were forbidden the use of them, under a severe penalty. Soon after the Reformation commenced in England, complaints were made by many of the dignified clergy and others of the intricacy and difficulty of the church-music of those times: in consequence of which it was once proposed, that organs and curious singing should be removed from our churches. Latimer, in his diocese of Worcester, went still farther, and issued injunctions to the prior and convent of St Mary, forbidding in their service all manner of singing. In the reign of Edward VI, a commission was granted to eight bishops, eight divines, eight civilians, and eight common lawyers, to compile a body of such ecclesiastical laws as should in future be observed throughout the realm. The result of this compilation was a work first published in 1571 by Fox the martyrologist, and afterwards in 1640, under the title of Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum. These 32 commissioners, instead of reproving church-music, merely condemned figurative and operose music, or that kind of singing which abounded with fugues, responsive passages, and a commixture of various and intricate proportions; which, whether contemporary or written, is by musicians termed descant. However,\never, notwithstanding the objections against choral music, and the practice of some of the reformed churches, the compilers of the English liturgy in 1548, and the king himself, determined to retain musical service. Accordingly the statute 2 & 3 Edw. VI. cap. 1, though it contains no formal obligation on the clergy, or others, to use or join in either vocal or instrumental music in the common prayer, does clearly recognize the practice of singing; and in less than two years after the compiling of King Edward's liturgy, a formula was composed, which continues, with scarce any variation, to be the rule for choral service even at this day. The author of this work was John Marbecke, or Marbecke; and it was printed by Richard Grafton, in 1550 under the title of the Book of Common Prayer, noted. Queen Mary laboured to re-establish the Homili choral service; but the accession of Elizabeth was followed by the act of uniformity; in consequence of which, and of the queen's injunctions, the Book of Common Prayer, noted by Marbecke, was considered as the general formula of choral service. In 1562, another musical service, with some additions and improvements, was printed by John Day; and in 1565, another collection of offices, with musical notes. Many objections were urged by Cartwright and other Puritans against the form and manner of cathedral service, to which Hooker replied in his Ecclesiastical Polity. In 1664, the statutes of Edward VI. and Elizabeth, for uniformity in the Common Prayer, were repealed; and the Directory for Public Worship, which allows only of the singing of psalms, established. But upon the restoration of Charles II. choral service was again revived, and has since uniformly continued. See on this subject Hawkins's History of Music, vol. i. p. 424; vol. ii. p. 264; vol. iii. p. 38—468, &c.; vol. iv. p. 44—347.\n\n**SERVICE-Tree.** See SORBUS, Botany Index.\n\n**SERVITES,** a religious order in the church of Rome, founded about the year 1233, by seven Florentine merchants, who, with the approbation of the bishop of Florence, renounced the world, and lived together in a religious community on Mount Senar, two leagues from that city.\n\n**SERVITOR,** in the university of Oxford, a student who attends on another for his maintenance and learning.

Hence the names of *servi centii*, *a-friptitii*, and *addicti glebae*; some whereof were taxable at the reasonable discretion of the lord; others at a certain rate agreed on; and others were inamortable, who, having no legitimate children, could not make a will to above the value of five pence, the lord being heir of all the rest; and others were prohibited marrying, or going to live out of the lordship.

King Charles I.\n\n**Court of SESSION.** See LAW, Part III., Sect. ii.\n\n**Court of Quarter-Sessions,** an English court that must be held in every county once in every quarter of a year; which, by statute 2 Henry V. c. 4, is appointed to be in the first week after Michaelmas-day, the first week after the epiphany, the first week after the close of Easter, and in the week after the translation of St Thomas the martyr, or the 7th of July. It is held before two or more justices of the peace, one of which must be of the quorum. The jurisdiction of this court, by 34 Edward III. c. 1, extends to the trying and determining all felonies and trespasses whatsoever: though they fail,\ndom, if ever, try any greater offence than small felonies within the benefit of clergy; their commission providing, that if any case of difficulty arises, they shall not proceed to judgement, but in the presence of one of the justices of the courts of king's bench or common-pleas, or one of the judges of assizes; and therefore murders, and other capital felonies, are usually remitted for a more solemn trial to the assizes. They cannot also try any new-created offence, without express power given them by the statute which creates it. But there are many offences and particular matters which, by particular statutes, belong properly to this jurisdiction, and ought to be prosecuted in this court; as, the smaller misdemeanors against the public or commonwealth, not amounting to felony; and especially offences relating to the game, highways, alehouses, bastard children, the settlement and provision for the poor, vagrants, servants wages, and Popish recusants. Some of these are proceeded upon by indictment; others in a summary way, by motion, and order thereupon; which order may for the most part, unless guarded against by particular statutes, be removed into the court of king's bench by writ of certiorari facias, and be there either quashed or confirmed. The records or rolls of the sessions are committed to the custody of a special officer, denominated cyflos rotulorum, who is always a justice of the quorum; and among them of the quorum (faith Lambard) a man for the most part especially picked out, either for wisdom, countenance, or credit. The nomination of the cyflos rotulorum (who is the principal officer in the county, as the lord-lieutenant is chief in military command) is by the king's sign manual: and to him the nomination of the clerk of the peace belongs; which office he is expressly forbidden to sell for money.\n\nIn most corporation-towns there are quarter-sessions kept before justices of their own, within their respective limits; which have exactly the same authority as the general quarter-sessions of the county, except in a very few instances; one of the most considerable of which is the matter of appeals from orders of removal of the poor, which, though they be from the orders of corporation-judges, must be to the sessions of the county, by statute 8 and 9 William III. c. 30. In both corporations and counties at large, there is sometimes kept a special or petty session, by a few justices, for dispatching smaller business in the neighbourhood between the times of the general sessions; as for licensing alehouses, paying the account of parish officers, and the like.\n\nSESTERCE, Sesterius, a silver coin, in use among the ancient Romans, called also simply nummus, and sometimes nummus sesterius. The sesterius was the fourth part of the denarius, and originally contained two asces and a half. It was at first denoted by LLS; the two L's signifying two librae, and the S half. But the librarii, afterwards converting the two L's into an H, expressed the sesterius by HS. The word sesterius was first introduced by way of abbreviation for semiliberius, which signifies two, and a half of a third, or literally, only half a third; for in expressing half a third, it was understood that there were two before.\n\nSome authors make two kinds of sesterces; the less called sesterce, in the masculine gender; and the great one, called sesterium, in the neuter: the first, that we have already described; the latter containing a thousand of the other. Others will have any such distinction of great and little sesterces unknown to the Romans: sesterius, say they, was an adjective, and signified as sesterce, or two asces and a half; and when used in the plural, as in quinquaginta sesterceum, or sestercia, it was only by way of abbreviation, and there was always understood centena, millia, &c.\n\nThis matter has been accurately stated by Mr Raper, in the following manner. The substantive to which sesterius referred is either as, or pondus; and sesterius as is two asces and a half; sesterium pondus, two pondus and a half, or two hundred and fifty denarii. When the denarius passed for ten asces, the sesterius of two asces and a half was a quarter of it; and the Romans continued to keep their accounts in these sesterces long after the denarius passed for fifteen asces; till, growing rich, they found it more convenient to reckon by quarters of the denarius, which they called nummi, and used the words nummus and sesterius indifferently, as synonymous terms, and sometimes both together, as sesterius nummus; in which case the word sesterius, having lost its original signification, was used as a substantive; for sesterius nummus was not two nummi and a half, but a single nummus of four asces. They called any sum under two thousand sesterces so many sesterii in the masculine gender; two thousand sesterces they called dua or bina sesteria, in the neuter; so many quarters making five hundred denarii, which was twice the sesterium; and they said dina, vicena, &c. sesteria, till the sum amounted to a thousand sesterces, which was a million of sesterces. But, to avoid ambiguity, they did not use the neuter sesterrium in the singular number, when the whole sum amounted to no more than a thousand sesterces, or one sesterium. They called a million of sesterces decies nummum, or decies sesterium, for decies centena millia nummorum, or sesteriarum (in the masculine gender), omitting centena millia for the sake of brevity. They likewise called the same sum decies sesterium (in the neuter gender) for decies centes sesterium, omitting centes for the same reason; or simply decies, omitting centena millia sesterium, or centes sesterium; and with the numeral adverbs deces, vicie, centier, millier, and the like, either centena millia or centes was always understood. There were their most usual forms of expression; though for bina, dina, vicena sesteria, they frequently laid bina, dina, vicena millia nummum. If the conular denarius contained 60 troy grains of fine silver, it was worth somewhat more than eight-pence farthing and a half sterling; and the as, of 16 to the denarius, a little more than a half-penny. To reduce the ancient sesterces of two asces and a half, when the denarius passed for 16, to pounds sterling, multiply the given number by 5454, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals. To reduce nummi sesterii, or quarters of the denarius, to pounds sterling; if the given sum be conular money, multiply it by 8727, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals; but for imperial money diminish the said product by one-eighth of itself.

See Botany Index.\n\n**SET**, or **SETS**, a term used by the farmers and gardeners to express the young plants of the white thorn and other shrubs, with which they use to raise their quick or quick-set hedges. The white thorn is the best of all trees for this purpose; and, under proper regulations, its sets seldom fail of answering the farmer's utmost expectations.\n\n**Set-off**, in Law, is an act whereby the defendant acknowledges the justice of the plaintiff's demand on the one hand; but, on the other, sets up a demand of his own, to counterbalance that of the plaintiff, either in the whole, or in part; as, if the plaintiff sues for \\( gl \\), due on a note of hand, the defendant may set off \\( gl \\), due to himself for merchandise sold to the plaintiff; and, in case he pleads such set-off, must pay the remaining balance into court. This answers very nearly to the compensation or stoppage of the civil law, and depends upon the statutes 2 Geo. II. cap. 22, and 8 Geo. II. cap. 24.\n\n**SETACEOUS WORM**, in Natural History, a name given by Dr Lister to that long and slender water-worm, which so much resembles a horse-hair, that it has been supposed by the vulgar to be an animated hair of that creature. These creatures, supposed to be living hairs, are a peculiar sort of insects, which are bred and nourished within the bodies of other insects, as the worms of the ichneumon flies are in the bodies of the caterpillars.\n\nAldrovand describes the creature, and tells us it was unknown to the ancients; but called *seta aquatica*, and *vermis setarius*, by the moderns, either from its figure resembling that of a hair, or from the supposition of its once having been the hair of some animal. We generally suppose it, in the imaginary state of the hair, to have belonged to a horse; but the Germans say it was once the hair of a calf, and call it by a name signifying *vitalis aquaticus*, or the \"water calf.\"\n\nAlbertus, an author much reverenced by the common people, has declared that this animal is generated of a hair; and adds, that any hair thrown into standing water, will, in a very little time, obtain life and motion. Other authors have differed from this opinion, and supposed them generated of the fibrous roots of water-plants; and others, of the parts of grasshoppers fallen into the water. This last opinion is rejected by Aldrovand as the most improbable of all. Standing and foul waters are most plentifully flooded with them; but they are sometimes found in the clearest and purest springs, and sometimes out of the water, on the leaves of trees and plants, as on the fruit-trees in our gardens, and the elms in hedges. They are from three to five inches long, of the thickness of a large hair; and are brown upon the back, and white under the belly, and the tail is white on every part.\n\n**SETH**, the third son of Adam, the father of Enos, was born 3874 B.C. and lived 912 years.\n\n**SETHIANS**, in church-history, Christian heretics; so called because they paid divine worship to Seth, whom they looked upon to be Jesus Christ the son of God, but who was made by a third divinity, and substituted in the room of the two families of Abel and Cain, which had been destroyed by the deluge. These heretics appeared in Egypt in the second century; and as they were addicted to all sorts of debauchery, they did not want followers; and continued in Egypt above 200 years.\n\n**SETIMO**, a town of Italy, in the province of Piedmont, situated on the river Po, eight miles north of Turin.\n\n**SETON**, in Surgery, a few horse hairs, small threads, or large packthread, drawn through the skin, chiefly the neck, by means of a large needle or probe, with a view to restore or preserve health.\n\nExperience shews that setons are useful in catarrhs, inflammations, and other disorders, and particularly those of the eyes; to these may be added feverish headaches, with stupor, drownings, epilepsies, and even apoplexy itself. See Surgery.\n\n**SETTEE**, in sea-language, a vessel very common in the Mediterranean with one deck and a very long and sharp prow. They carry some two masts, some three, without top-masts. They have generally two masts, equipped with triangular sails, commonly called *lateen sails*. The least of them are of 60 tons burden. They serve to transport cannon and provisions for ships of war and the like. These vessels are peculiar to the Mediterranean sea, and are usually navigated by Italians, Greeks, or Mahometans.\n\n**SETTING**, in Astronomy, the withdrawing of a star or planet, or its sinking below the horizon. Astronomers and poets make three different kinds of setting of the stars, viz. the Cosmical, Acronyical, and Heliacal. See these articles.\n\n**Setting**, in the sea language. To set the land or the sun by the compass, is to observe how the land bears on any point of the compass, or on what point of the compass the sun is. Also when two ships sail in sight of one another, to mark on what point the chafed bears, is termed setting the chase by the compass.\n\n**Setting**, among sportsmen, a term used to express the manner of taking partridges by means of a dog peculiarly trained to that purpose. See Shooting.\n\n**Act of Settlement**, in British history, a name given to the statute 12 and 13 Will. III. cap. 2, whereby the crown was limited to his present majesty's illustrious house; and some new provisions were added, at the same fortunate era, for better securing our religion, laws, and liberties; which the statute declares to be the birthright of the people of England, according to the ancient doctrine of the common law.\n\n**Seven Stars**, a common denomination given to the cluster of stars in the neck of the sign Taurus, the bull; properly called the Pleiades. They are so called from their number seven, which appear to the naked eye, though some eyes can discover only six of them; but by the aid of telescopes there appears to be a great multitude of them.\n\n**Seventh**, in Music, an interval called by the Greeks heptachordon. See Interval.\n\n**Severance**, in Law, the flinging or severing two or more that join or are joined in the same writ or action.\nSeverance tion. As if two join in a writ, de libertate probanda, and the one be afterwards nonfitted; here severance is permitted, so as notwithstanding the nonfuit of the one, the other may severally proceed.\n\nThere is also severance of the tenants in assise; when one, two, or more diffees appear upon the writ, and not the other. And severance in debt, where two executors are named plaintiffs, and the one refuses to prosecute. We also meet with severance of fummons, severance in attaints, &c.

It is a country overrun with woods, and on the south part is a forest of great length. Novogrode, or Novgorod, is the capital town.\n\nSEVERINA, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in Lower Calabria, with an archbishop's see.

Lat. 43. 16.\n\nSEVERN, a river of England which rises near Plimlimon Hill in Montgomeryshire, and before it enters Shropshire receives about 30 streams, and passes down to Ludlow, where it receives the Morda, that flows from Offerton. When it arrives at Monford, it receives the river Mon, passing on to Shrewsbury, which it almost surrounds, then to Bridgnorth; afterwards it runs through the skirts of Staffordshire, enters Worcestershire, and passes by Worcester; then it runs to Tewkesbury, where it joins the Avon, and from thence to Gloucester, keeping a north-westerly course, till it falls into the Bristol Channel. It begins to be navigable for boats at Welshpool, in Montgomeryshire, and takes in several other rivers in its course, besides those already mentioned, and is the second in England. By the late inland navigation, it has communication with the rivers Mersey, Dee, Ribble, Ouse, Trent, Derwent, Humber, Thames, Avon, &c. which navigation, including its windings, extends above 500 miles in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, York, Lancaster, Westmoreland, Chester, Stafford, Warwick, Leicester, Oxford, Worcester, &c. A canal from Stroud-Water, a branch of the Severn, to join the Thames, was projected and executed for the purpose of conveying a tunnel 16 feet high and 16 feet wide, under Sapperton Hill and Hayley-Wood (very high ground), for two miles and a quarter in length, through a very hard rock, which was lined and arched with brick. This stupendous undertaking was completed, and boats passed through it the 21st of May 1789. By this opening, a communication is made between the river Severn at Framilode and the Thames near Lechlade, and will be continued over the Thames below St John-Bridge, and so to Oxford, &c. and London, for conveyance of coals, goods, &c. It is now navigable from the Severn to Themsford, by way of Stroud, Cirencester, Cricklade, &c. being filled with water for that purpose near 40 miles.\n\nSEVERUS, Cornelius, an ancient Latin poet of the Augustan age; whose Æneid, together with a fragment De morte Ciceronis, were published, with notes and a prose interpretation, by Le Clerc, 12mo, Amsterdam, 1723. They were before inserted among the Cataleptæ Virgiliæ published by Scaliger; whole notes, with others, Le Clerc has received among his own.\n\nSEVERUS, Septimus, a Roman emperor, who has been so much admired for his military talents, that some have called him the most warlike of the Roman emperors. As a monarch he was cruel, and it has been observed, that he never did an act of humanity or forgave a fault. In his diet he was temperate, and he always showed himself an open enemy to pomp and splendor. He loved the appellation of a man of letters, and he even composed an history of his own reign, which some have praised for its correctness and veracity. However cruel Severus may appear in his punishments and in his revenge, many have endeavoured to exculpate him, and observed that there was need of severity in an empire where the morals were so corrupted, and where no less than 3000 persons were accused of adultery during the space of 17 years. Of him, as of Augustus, some were disposed to say, that it would have been better for the world if he had never been born, or had never died. See Rome, No. 372.\n\nSEVERUS'S Wall, in British topography, the fourth and last barrier erected by the Romans against the incursions of the North Britons. See the articles ADRIAN, and ANTONINUS'S WALL.\n\nWe learn from several hints in the Roman historians, that the country between the walls of Hadrian and Antoninus continued to be a scene of perpetual war and subject of contention between the Romans and Britons, from the beginning of the reign of Commodus to the arrival of the emperor Septimius Severus in Britain, A.D. 206. This last emperor having subjugated the Maeatae, and repulsed the Caledonians, determined to erect a stronger and more impenetrable barrier than any of the former, against their future incursions.\n\nThough neither Dio nor Herodian make any mention of a wall built by Severus in Britain for the protection of the Roman province, yet we have abundant evidence from other writers of equal authority, that he really built such a wall. \"He fortified Britain (says Spartan) with a wall drawn across the island from sea to sea; which is the greatest glory of his reign. After the wall was finished, he retired to the next station (York), not only a conqueror, but the founder of an eternal peace.\" To the same purpose, Aurelius Victor and Orofius, to say nothing of Eutropius and Cassiodorus: \"Having repelled the enemy in Britain, he fortified the country, which was suited to that purpose, with a wall drawn across the island from sea to sea.\"\n\n\"Severus drew a great ditch, and built a strong wall, fortified...\"\nfortified with several turrets, from sea to sea, to protect that part of the island which he had recovered from the yet unconquered nations.\" As the residence of the emperor Severus in Britain was not quite four years, it is probable that the two last of them were employed in building this wall; according to which account, it was begun A.D. 209, and finished A.D. 211.\n\nThis wall of Severus was built nearly on the same tract with Hadrian's rampart, at the distance only of a few paces north. The length of this wall, from Cousin's house near the mouth of the river Tyne on the east, to Boulness on the Solway frith on the west, hath been found, from two actual measurements, to be a little more than 68 English miles, and a little less than 74 Roman miles. To the north of the wall was a broad and deep ditch, the original dimensions of which cannot now be ascertained, only it seems to have been larger than that of Hadrian. The wall itself, which stood on the south brink of the ditch, was built of freestone, and where the foundation was not good, it is built on piles of oak; the interferences between the two faces of this wall is filled with broad thin stones, placed not perpendicularly, but obliquely on their edges; the running mortar or cement was then poured upon them, which, by its great strength and tenacity, bound the whole together, and made it firm as a rock. But though these materials are sufficiently known, it is not easy to guess where they were procured, for many parts of the wall are at a great distance from any quarry of freestone; and, though stone of another kind was within reach, yet it does not appear to have been anywhere used. The height of this wall was 12 feet besides the parapet, and its breadth 8 feet, according to Bede, who lived only at a small distance from the east end of it, and in whose time it was in many places almost quite entire. Such was the wall erected by the command and under the direction of the emperor Severus in the north of England; and, considering the length, breadth, height, and solidity, it was certainly a work of great magnificence and prodigious labour. But the wall itself was but a part, and not the most extraordinary part, of this work. The great number and different kinds of fortresses which were built along the line of it for its defence, and the military ways with which it was attended, are still more worthy of our admiration, and come now to be described.\n\nThe fortresses which were erected along the line of Severus's wall for its defence, were of three different kinds, and three different degrees of strength; and were called by three different Latin words, which may be translated stations, castles, and turrets. Of each of these in their order.\n\nThe stations, stations, were so called from their flatness and the flatted residence of garrisons. They were also called castra, which hath been converted into castres, a name which many of them still bear. These were by far the largest, strongest, and most magnificent of the fortresses which were built upon the wall, and were designed for the head-quarters of the cohorts of troops which were placed there in garrison, and from whence detachments were sent into the adjoining castles and turrets. These stations, as appears from the edifices of them which are still visible, were not all exactly of the same figure nor of the same dimensions; some of them being exactly squares, and others oblong, and some of them a little larger than others. These variations were no doubt occasioned by the difference of situation and other circumstances. The stations were fortified with deep ditches and strong walls, the wall itself coinciding with and forming the north wall of each station. Within the stations were lodgings for the officers and soldiers in garrison; the smallest of them being sufficient to contain a cohort, or 650 men. Without the walls of each station was a town, inhabited by labourers, artificers, and others, both Romans and Britons, who chose to dwell under the protection of these fortresses. The number of the stations upon the wall was exactly 18; and if they had been placed at equal distances, the interval between every two of them would have been four miles and a few paces; but the intervention of rivers, marshes, and mountains; the conveniency of situations for strength, prospect, and water; and many other circumstances to us unknown, determined them to place these stations at unequal distances. The situation which was always chosen by the Romans, both here and everywhere else in Britain where they could obtain it, was the gentle declivity of a hill, near a river, and facing the meridian sun. Such was the situation of the far greatest part of the stations on this wall. In general, we may observe, that the stations stood thickest near the two ends and in the middle, probably because the danger of invasion was greatest in these places. But the reader will form a clearer idea of the number of these stations, their Latin and English names, their situation and distance from one another, by inspecting the following table, than we can give him with equal brevity in any other way. The first column contains the number of the station, reckoning from east to west; the second contains its Latin, and the third its English name; and the three last its distance from the next station to the west of it, in miles, furlongs, and chains.\n\n| No | Latin Name     | English Name    | M. | F. | C. |\n|----|----------------|-----------------|----|----|----|\n| 1  | Segedunum      | Cousin's-house  | 3  | 5  | 1½|\n| 2  | Pons Aelii     | Newcastle       | 2  | 0  | 9 |\n| 3  | Condercum     | Benwell hill    | 6  | 6  | 3 |\n| 4  | Vindobala     | Rutchester      | 7  | 0  | 3½|\n| 5  | Hunnum        | Halton-chefters | 5  | 1  | 7 |\n| 6  | Cilurnum      | Walwick-chefters| 3  | 1  | 8 |\n| 7  | Procolitia    | Carrawbrugh     | 4  | 5  | 3½|\n| 8  | Borovicus     | Houfefeeds      | 1  | 3  | 8 |\n| 9  | Vindolana     | Little-chefters | 3  | 6  | 4 |\n| 10 | Aesica        | Great-chefters  | 2  | 1  | 6½|\n| 11 | Magna         | Carrvoran       | 2  | 6  | 0 |\n| 12 | Amboglana     | Burdofwald      | 6  | 2  | 8 |\n| 13 | Petriana      | Cambeck         | 2  | 6  | 6 |\n| 14 | Aballaba      | Watchcrofs      | 5  | 1  | 9 |\n| 15 | Congavata     | Stanwix         | 3  | 3  | 4 |\n| 16 | Axedonum      | Brigh           | 4  | 0  | 9 |\n| 17 | Gabrofentum   | Brunbrugh       | 3  | 4  | 1 |\n| 18 | Tunnoculum    | Boulness        | 0  | 0  | 0 |\n\nLength of the wall 68\n\nThe castella, or castles, were the second kind of fortifications which were built along the line of this wall for its defence. These castles were neither so large nor\nStrong as the stations, but much more numerous, being no fewer than 81. The shape and dimensions of the castles, as appears from the foundations of many of them which are still visible, were exact squares of 66 feet every way. They were fortified on every side with thick and lofty walls, but without any ditch, except on the north side; on which the wall itself, raised much above its usual height, with the ditch attending it, formed the fortification. The castles were situated in the intervals between the stations, at the distance of about seven furlongs from each other; though particular circumstances sometimes occasioned a little variation. In these castles, guards were constantly kept by a competent number of men detached from the nearest stations.\n\nThe turrets, or turrets, were the third and last kind of fortifications on the wall. These were still much smaller than the castles, and formed only a figure of about 12 feet, standing out of the wall on its south side. Being so small, they are more entirely ruined than the stations and castles, which makes it difficult to discover their exact number. They stood in the intervals between the castles; and from the faint vestiges of a few of them, it is conjectured that there were four of them between every two castles, at the distance of about 300 yards from one another. According to this conjecture, the number of the turrets amounted to 324. They were designed for watch-towers and places for sentinels, who, being within hearing of one another, could convey an alarm or piece of intelligence to all parts of the wall in a very little time.\n\nSuch were the stations, castles, and turrets, on the wall of Severus; and a very considerable body of troops was constantly quartered in them for its defence. The usual complement allowed for this service was as follows:\n\n1. Twelve cohorts of foot, consisting of 600 men each, 7200\n2. One cohort of mariners in the station at Boulnes, 600\n3. One detachment of Moors, probably equal to a cohort, 600\n4. Four alae or wings of horse, consisting, at the lowest computation, of 400 each, 1600\n\nFor the convenience of marching these troops from one part of the wall to another, with the greater ease and expedition, on any service, it was attended with two military ways, paved with square stones, in the most solid and beautiful manner. One of these ways was smaller, and the other larger. The smaller military way ran close along the south side of the wall, from turret to turret, and castle to castle, for the use of the soldiers in relieving their guards and sentinels, and such services. The larger way did not keep so near the wall, nor touch at the turrets or castles, but pursued the most direct course from one station to another, and was designed for the convenience of marching larger bodies of troops.\n\nIt is to be regretted, that we cannot gratify the reader's curiosity, by informing him by what particular bodies of Roman troops the several parts of this great work were executed; as we were enabled to do with regard to the wall of Antoninus Pius from inscriptions. For Severus, though it is probable that there were stones with inscriptions of the same kind, mentioning the several bodies of troops, and the quantity of work performed by each of them, originally inserted in the face of this wall, yet none of them are now to be found. There have indeed been discovered, in or near the ruins of this wall, a great number of small square stones, with very short, and generally imperfect, inscriptions upon them; mentioning particular legions, cohorts, and centuries; but without directly asserting that they had built any part of the wall, or naming any number of paces. Of these inscriptions, the reader may see no fewer than twenty-nine among the Northumberland and Cumberland inscriptions in Mr. Horsley's Britannia Romana. As the stones on which these inscriptions are cut are of the same shape and size with the other facing-stones of this wall, it is almost certain that they have been originally placed in the face of it. It is equally certain, from the uniformity of these inscriptions, that they were all intended to intimate some one thing, and nothing so probable as that the adjacent wall was built by the troops mentioned in them. This was, perhaps, too well understood, that it was not thought necessary to be expressed; and the distance of these inscriptions from one another showed the quantity of work performed. If this was really the case, we know in general, that this great work was executed by the second and fifth legions, these being the only legions mentioned in these inscriptions. Now, if this prodigious wall, with all its appendages of ditches, stations, castles, turrets, and military ways, was executed in the space of two years by two legions only, which, when most complete, made no more than 12,000 men, how greatly must we admire the skill, the industry, and excellent discipline of the Roman soldiers, who were not only the valiant guardians of the empire in times of war, but its most active and useful members in times of peace?\n\nThis wall of Severus, and its fortresses, proved an imperceptible barrier to the Roman territories for near 200 years. But about the beginning of the 5th century, the Roman empire being assaulted on all sides, and the bulk of their forces withdrawn from Britain, the Maeatae and Caledonians, now called Scots and Picts, became more daring; and some of them breaking through the wall, and others failing round the ends of it, they carried their ravages into the very heart of Provincial Britain. These invaders were indeed several times repulsed after this by the Roman legions sent to the relief of the Britons. The last of these legions, under the command of Gallo of Ravenna, having, with the assistance of the Britons, thoroughly repaired the breaches of Severus's wall and its fortresses, and exhorted the Britons to make a brave defence, took their final farewell of Britain. It soon appeared, that the strongest walls and ramparts are no security to an undisciplined and dastardly rabble, as the unhappy Britons then were. The Scots and Picts met with little resistance in breaking through the wall, while the towns and castles were tamely abandoned to their destructive rage. In many places they levelled it with the ground, that it might prove no obstruction to their future inroads.—From this time no attempts were ever made to repair this noble work. Its beauty and grandeur procured it no respect in the dark and tasteless ages which succeeded. It became...\ncame the common quarry for more than a thousand years, out of which all the towns and villages around were built; and is now so entirely ruined, that the penetrating eyes of the most poring and patient antiquarian can hardly trace its vanishing foundations.\n\nSEVIGNE', MARIE DE RABUTIN, MARQUISE DE, a French lady, was born in 1626. When only a year old she lost her father, who was killed in the defense of the English on the isle of Rhé, where he commanded a company of volunteers. In 1644 she married the marquis of Sevigné, who was slain in a duel by the chevalier d'Albret, in 1651. She had by him a son and a daughter, to the education of whom she afterwards religiously devoted herself. Her daughter was married in 1669 to the count of Grignan, who conducted her to Provence. Madame de Sevigné consoled herself by writing frequent letters to her daughter. She fell at last the victim to her maternal tenderness. In one of her visits to Grignan, the fatigued herself so much during the sickness of her daughter, that she was seized with a fever, which carried her off on the 14th of January 1669. We have two portraits of Madame de Sevigné; the one by the comte de Buffi, the other by Madame de la Fayette. The first exhibits her defects; the second her excellencies. Buffi describes her as a lively gay coquette, a lover of flattery, fond of titles, honour, and distinction: M. de la Fayette as a woman of wit and good sense, as possessed of a noble soul, formed for dispensing benefits, incapable of debasing herself by avarice, and blest with a generous, obliging, and faithful heart. Both these portraits are in some measure just. That she was vain-glorying, appears evident from her own letters, which, on the other hand, exhibit undoubted proofs of her virtue and goodness of heart.\n\nThis illustrious lady was acquainted with all the wits of her age. It is said that she decided the famous dispute between Perrault and Boileau concerning the preference of the ancients to the moderns, thus, \"The ancients are the finest, and we are the prettiest.\" She left behind her a most valuable collection of letters, the best edition of which is that of 1775, in 8 vols 12mo.\n\n\"The letters (says Voltaire) are filled with anecdotes, written with freedom, and in a natural and animated style; are an excellent criticism on studied letters of wit, and still more on those fictitious letters which aim at the epistolary style, by a recital of false sentiments and feigned adventures to an imaginary correspondent.\"\n\nIt were to be wished that a proper selection had been made of these letters. It is difficult to read eight volumes of letters, which, though infinitely written, present frequent repetitions, and are often filled with trifles. What makes them in general perhaps so interesting is, that they are in part historical. They may be looked on as a relation of the manners, the ton, the genius, the fashions, the etiquette, which reigned in the court of Louis XIV. They contain many curious anecdotes nowhere else to be found: But these excellencies would be still more striking, were they sometimes stripped of that multitude of domestic affairs and minute incidents which ought naturally to have died with the mother and the daughter. A volume entitled Sevigniana was published at Paris in 1756, which is nothing more than a collection of the fine sentiments, literary and historical anecdotes, and moral apophthegms, scattered throughout these letters.\n\nSEVILLE, a large and populous city of Spain, stands on the banks of the Guadalquivir, in the midst of a rich, and to the eye a boundless, plain; in W. Long. 5° 5', N. Lat. 37° 20'. This city is supposed to have been founded by the Phoenicians, who gave it the name of Hippalis. When it fell under the power of the Romans, it was called Julia; and at last, after a variety of corruptions, was called Sebilla or Sevilla; both of which names are retained by the Spaniards. The Romans embellished it with many magnificent edifices; of which scarce any vestige now remains. The Gothic kings for some time made it their residence: but in process of time they removed their court to Toledo; and Seville was taken by storm soon after the victory obtained at Xeres over the Gothic king Rodrigo.—In 1027, Seville became an independent monarchy; but was conquered 70 years afterwards by Yusuf Almoravides, an African prince. At last it was taken by Ferdinand III. after a year's siege; and 300,000 Moors were then obliged to leave the place. Notwithstanding this prodigious emigration, Seville continued to be a great and populous city, and soon after it was enlarged and adorned with many magnificent buildings, the chief of which is the cathedral. Seville arrived at its utmost pitch of grandeur a little after the discovery of America, the reason of which was, that all the valuable productions of the West Indies were carried thither. Its court was then the most splendid in Europe; but in the course of a few years all this grandeur disappeared, owing to the impediments in navigating the Guadalquivir. The superior excellence of the port of Cadiz induced government to order the galleons to be stationed there in time to come.\n\nSeville is of a circular form, and is surrounded by a wall about five miles and a half in circumference, containing 176 towers. The ditch in many places is filled up. The streets of Seville are crooked and dirty, and most of them so narrow that two carriages can scarcely pass one another abreast.\n\nSeville is said to contain 80,268 souls, and is divided into 30 parishes. It has 84 convents, with 24 hospitals.\n\nOf the public edifices of this city the cathedral is the Townsend's most magnificent. Its dimensions are 420 feet in length, Travels, 263 in breadth within the walls, and 126 feet in height. vol. ii. It has nine doors, 80 altars, at which 500 masses are daily celebrated, and 80 windows of painted glass, each of which cost 1000 ducats. At one angle stands a tower of Moorish workmanship 350 feet high. On the top of it is the giralda, or large brazen image, which, with its palm branch, weighs near one ton and a half, yet turns as a weather-cock with the slightest variation of the wind. The whole work is brick and mortar. The passage to the top is an inclined plane, which winds about in the inside in the manner of a spiral staircase, so easy of ascent that a horse might trot from the bottom to the top; at the same time it is so wide that two horsemen may ride abreast. What appears very unaccountable, the solid masonry in the upper half is just as thick again as that in the lower, though on the outside the tower is all the way of the same dimensions. In the opinion of Mr Swinburne, this cathedral is inferior to York.\nSeville. York minster. Its treasures are inestimable; one altar with all its ornaments is solid silver; of the same metal are the images of St Isidore and St Leander, which are as large as the life; and a tabernacle for the host more than four yards high, adorned with 48 columns. Before the choir of the cathedral is the tomb of the celebrated Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America. His monument consists of one stone only, on which these words are inscribed, *A Cofella y Arragon otro mundo dio Colon*; that is, \"To Cattle and Arragon Columbus gave another world:\" an inscription simple and expressive, the justness of which will be acknowledged by those who have read the adventures of this illustrious but unfortunate man. The cathedral was begun by Don Sancho the Brave, about the close of the 13th century, and finished by John II. about a hundred years after. To the cathedral belongs a library of 20,000 volumes, collected by Hernando the son of Columbus; but, to the disgrace of the Spaniards, it has scarcely received any addition since the death of the founder. The organ in this cathedral is a very ingenious piece of mechanism. \"I was much pleased (says Mr Townfend in his interesting travels) with the construction of a new organ, containing 5300 pipes, with 110 stops, which latter, as the builder told me, is so more than are in the famous one of Haarlem; yet, for example are the bellows, that when stretched they supply the full organ in 5 minutes. The mode of filling them with air is singular; for, instead of working with his hands, a man walks backwards and forwards along an inclined plane of about 15 feet in length, which is balanced in the middle on its axis; under each end is a pair of bellows, of about six feet by three and a half. These communicate with five other pairs united by a bar; and the latter are so contrived, that when they are in danger of being overtrained, a valve is lifted up, and gives them relief. Puffing 10 times along the inclined plane fills all the vessels.\"\n\nThe Canos de Carmone, or great aqueduct of Seville, is reckoned by the historians of this city one of the most wonderful works of antiquity. Mr Swinburne, however, remarks, that it is ugly, crooked, the arches unequal, and the architecture neglected. The conduit is so leaky, that a rivulet is formed by the waste water. Nevertheless, it still conveys to the city an ample supply of water sufficient to turn several mills, and to give almost every house in town the benefit of it.\n\nMany of the convents are remarkable for the beauty of their architecture; but in Seville the eye covets only pictures, of which there is a wonderful profusion. Among these are the works of the famous painter Murillo, with many others universally admired.\n\nThe convent of the Franciscans contains 15 cloisters, with apartments for 200 monks, though, when Mr Townfend visited them, they amounted only to 140. The annual expenditure of these, who are all fed on charity, is about 4000l. sterling. \"In the principal cloister (says the same intelligent traveller), which is entirely inclosed by a multitude of little chapels, are represented, in 14 pictures, each called a station, all the sufferings of the Redeemer. They are so arranged as to mark given distances by walking round the cloister from the first to the second, and so in order to the rest. Over them is mentioned the number of steps taken by our Lord between the several incidents of his passion in his way to Calvary; and these precisely are the paces measured for the pilgrims in their progress from one station to another. Over one is the following inscription: 'This station consists of 1087 steps. Here the blest Redeemer fell a second time under the weight of his cross, and here is to be gained the indulgence of seven years and forty quarantines. Mental prayer, the Paternoster, and the Ave Maria.' This may serve as an example for the rest.\"\n\nThe principal manufacture of Seville is snuff. Mr Townfend, who paid particular attention to it, informs us, that the building in which it is carried on is elegant and simple in its form, and is about 600 feet by 480, and not less than 60 feet in height, with four regular fronts, including 28 quadrangles. It cost 37,600,000 of reals, or about 370,000l. At present (1787), no more than 1700 workmen are employed, and 100 horses or mules; but formerly 3000 men were engaged, and near 400 horses. This falling off is attributed by Mr Swinburne to a practice which the directors followed, of adulterating the tobacco with the red earth of Almazarra. When Mr Townfend visited this manufacture, they had changed their system. From the year 1780, he informs us, the annual sale of tobacco from Brazil has been 1,500,000 pounds, purchased from the Portuguese at three reals a pound; and of snuff from the produce of their own colonies 1,600,000 pounds, beside cigars (A) to a very considerable amount. They have lying by them more than 5,000,000 pounds of snuff un-folded; but as it will not suffer by age, they are not uneasy at this accumulation. Besides the peculiar kind of snuff with which Spain was accustomed to supply the market, they have lately introduced the manufacture of rappee. In this branch alone are employed 220 persons, old and young, with 16 mules.\n\n\"All the workmen (continues Mr Townfend) deposit their cloaks at the door; and when they go out are so strictly examined, that they have little chance of being able to conceal tobacco; yet they sometimes venture to hide it about their persons. An officer and a guard is always attending to take delinquents into custody; and that they may prevent resistance, no workman is permitted to enter with a knife. Were it not for this precaution, the consequence of a detection might be fatal. The whole business is conducted by a director, with a salary of 40,000 reals a-year, and 54 superior officers, assisted by as many subordinate to them. For grinding their snuff, they have 40 mills, each consisting of a stone roller, moved by a large horse or mule, with the traces fastened to a beam of eight feet in length, in the angle of 45 degrees, consequently losing precisely half his force.\"\n\nBefore Mr Townfend left Seville, according to his usual practice, which was truly laudable, he enquired into the prices of labour and provisions. As a piece of curious\n\n(A) These are little rolls of tobacco which the Spaniards smoke without a pipe.\ncurious and useful information, and as an example to other travellers, we present them to our readers. They are as follows:\n\nDay-labourers 4½ reals, about L. o c 104\nCarpenters from 7 to 11 —\nJoiners, if good workmen, 24 — or 0 4 9\nWeavers, if good workmen, 15 reals, about — 0 3 0\nBread, for 3 lb. of 16 oz. 16 quartos, or — 0 0 4½\n— sometimes 28 quartos, or — 0 0 7½\nBeef, 30 quartos for 32 oz. per lb. about — 0 4½\nMutton, 38 do. do. — 0 5½\nKid, 24 do. — 0 3½\nPork from 36 to 42 quartos, do. { or 0 5½\nto 0 5½\n\nThe price of wheat has at different periods been very remarkable. In 1652, it sold at the rate of 15s. 3½d. the bushel; and in 1657, it fell so low as 15s. 4½d. per bushel, reckoning the fanega at 109½ lb. and the bushel at 70.\n\nSEVUM MINERALE, mineral tallow; a substance somewhat resembling tallow, found on the sea-coasts of Finland in the year 1736. It burns with a blue flame, and smell of grease, leaving a black viscid matter which cannot easily be consumed. It is extremely light; being only of the specific gravity of 0.777; whereas tallow is not less than 0.969. It is partly soluble in highly rectified spirit of wine; but entirely so in expressed oils when boiling. It is met with in some of the rocky parts of Peria, but there it appears to be mixed with petroleum. Dr Herman of Strasbourg mentions a spring in the neighbourhood of that city which contains a substance of this sort diffused through it, separating, and capable of being collected on ebullition.—A fat mineral matter resembling butter or tallow has lately been extracted from peat in Lancashire. See PEAT.\n\nSEWAURY, a Hindoo word used in Bengal, and signifying the train of attendants that accompany a nabob or great man.\n\nSEWER, in the Household, an officer who arranged on the table the dishes of a king or nobleman.\n\nSEWER is also a passage or gutter made to carry water into the sea or a river, whereby to preserve the land, &c., from inundations and other annoyances.\n\nCourt of Commissioners of SEWERS in England, a temporary tribunal, erected by virtue of a commission under the great seal; which formerly used to be granted pro rata at the pleasure of the crown, but now at the discretion and nomination of the lord chancellor, lord treasurer, and chief justices, pursuant to the statute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 5. Their jurisdiction is to overlook the repairs of sea-banks and sea-walls, and the cleansing of rivers, public streams, ditches, and other conduits, whereby any waters are carried off; and is confined to such county or particular district as the commission shall expressly name. The commissioners are a court of record, and may fine and imprison for contempts; and in the execution of their duty may proceed by jury, or upon their own view, and may take order for the removal of any annoyances, or the safeguard and conservation of the sewers within their commission, either according to the laws and customs of Romney-marsh, or otherwise at their own discretion. They may also assess such rates or costs upon the owners of lands within their district as they shall judge necessary; and if any person refuses to pay them, the commissioners may levy the same by distress of his goods and chattels; or they may, by statute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 5, sell his freehold lands (and by the 7 Ann. c. 15. his copyhold also), in order to pay such costs or assessments. But their conduct is under the control of the court of King's-bench, which will prevent or punish any illegal or tyrannical proceedings.\n\nAnd yet in the reign of King James I. (8th Nov. 1616.), the privy-council took upon them to order, that no action or complaint should be prosecuted against the commissioners unless before that board; and committed several to prison who had brought such actions at common law, till they should release the same: and one of the reasons for discharging Sir Edward Coke from his office of lord chief-justice, was for countenancing those legal proceedings. The pretence for these arbitrary measures was no other than the tyrant's plea of the necessity of unlimited powers in works of evident utility to the public, \"the supreme reason above all reasons, which is the salvation of the king's lands and people.\" But now it is clearly held, that this (as well as all other inferior jurisdiction) is subject to the discretionary coercion of his majesty's court of King's-bench.\n\nCommon SEWERS, in Rome, were executed at a great expense. It was proposed that they should be of sufficient dimensions to admit a waggon loaded with hay. When these common sewers came to be obstructed, or out of repair, under the republic, the censors contracted to pay a thousand talents, or about 193,000l. for clearing and repairing them. They were again in repair, at the accession of Augustus Caesar, and the repairing them is mentioned among the great works of Agrippa. He is said to have turned the course of seven rivers into these subterraneous passages, to have made them navigable, and to have actually passed in barges under the streets and buildings of Rome. These works are still supposed to remain; but as they exceed the power and resources of the present city to keep them in repair, they are quite concealed, except at one or two places. They were in the midst of the Roman greatness, and still are, reckoned among the wonders of the world; and yet they are said to have been works of the elder Tarquin, a prince whose territory did not extend, in any direction, above 16 miles; and, on this supposition, they must have been made to accommodate a city that was calculated chiefly for the reception of cattle, herdsmen, and banditti. Rude nations sometimes execute works of great magnificence, as fortresses and temples, for the purposes of war and superstition; but seldom palaces, and still more seldom works of mere convenience and cleanliness, in which for the most part they are long defective. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to question the authority of tradition in respect to this singular monument of antiquity, which so greatly exceeds what the best accommodated city of modern Europe could undertake for its own convenience. And if those works are still entire, and may continue to for thousands of years, it may be suspected that they were even prior to the settlement of Romulus, and may have been the remains of a more ancient city, on the ruins of which the followers of Romulus settled, as the Arabs now but or encamp\nSex encamp on the ruins of Palmyra and Balbec. Livy owns, that the common sewers were not accommodated to the plan of Rome, as it was laid out in his time; they were carried in directions across the streets, and passed under buildings of the greatest antiquity. This arrangement indeed he imputes to the hasty rebuilding of the city after its destruction by the Gauls; but haste, it is probable, would have determined the people to build on their old foundations, or at least not to change them so much as to cross the direction of former streets.\n\nSEX, the property by which any animal is male or female.\n\nLavater has drawn the following characteristic distinctions between the male and female of the human species.\n\n\"The primary matter of which women are constituted appears to be more flexible, irritable, and elastic, than that of man. They are formed to maternal mildness and affection; all their organs are tender, yielding, easily wounded, sensible, and receptive. Among a thousand females there is scarcely one without the generic feminine signs; the flexible, the circular, and the irritable.\n\n\"They are the counterpart of man, taken out of man, to be subject to man; to comfort him like angels, and to lighten his cares. 'She shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holiness, with sobriety' (1 Tim. ii. 15). This tenderness, this sensibility, this light texture of their fibres and organs, this volatility of feeling, render them so easy to conduct and to tempt; so ready of submission to the enterprise and power of the man; but more powerful through the aid of their charms than man with all his strength. The man was not first tempted, but the woman, afterward the man by the woman. And, not only easy to be tempted, she is capable of being formed to the purest, noblest, most ethereal virtue; to everything which can deserve praise or affection. Highly sensible of purity, beauty, and symmetry, she does not always take time to reflect on internal life, internal death, internal corruption. 'The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, and she took of the fruit thereof.' (Gen. iii. 6.)\n\n\"The female thinks not profoundly; profound thought is the power of the man. Women feel more. Sensibility is the power of woman. They often rule more effectually, more sovereignly, than man. They rule with tender looks, tears, and sighs; but not with passion and threats; for if, or when, they do rule, they are no longer women, but abortions. They are capable of the sweetest sensibility, the most profound emotion, the utmost humility, and the excess of enthusiasm. In their countenance are the signs of sanctity and inviolability, which every feeling man honours, and the effects of which are often miraculous. Therefore, by the irritability of their nerves, their incapacity for deep inquiry and firm decision, they may easily from their extreme sensibility become the most irreclaimable, the most rapturous enthusiasts. Their love, strong and rooted as it is, is very changeable; their hatred almost incurable, and only to be effaced by continued and artful flattery. Men are most profound; women are more sublime.\n\n\"Men most embrace the whole; women remark individually, and take more delight in selecting the minute which form the whole. Man hears the bursting thunder, views the destructive bolt with serene aspect, and stands erect amidst the fearful majesty of the streaming clouds. Woman trembles at the lightning, and the voice of distant thunder; and shrinks into herself or sinks into the arms of man. Man receives a ray of light, single, woman delights to view it through a prism in all its dazzling colours. She contemplates the rainbow as the promise of peace; he extends his inquiring eye over the whole horizon. Woman laughs, man smiles; woman weeps, man remains silent. Woman is in anguish when man weeps, and in despair when man is in anguish; yet has she often more faith than man. Man without religion, is a diseased creature, who would persuade himself he is well, and needs not a physician; but woman without religion, is raging and monstrous. A woman with a beard is not so diluting as a woman who acts the freethinker; her sex is formed to piety and religion; to them Christ first appeared; but he was obliged to prevent them from too ardently, and too hastily, embracing him: 'Touch me not.' They are prompt to receive and seize novelty, and become its enthusiastic. The whole world is forgotten in the emotion caused by the presence and proximity of him they love. They sink into the most incurable melancholy, as they also rise to the most enraptured heights.\n\n\"Male sensation is more imagination, female more heart. Whea communicative, they are more communicative than man; when secret, more secret. In general they are more patient, long-suffering, credulous, benevolent, and modest. Woman is not a foundation on which to build. She is the gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble (1 Cor. iii. 12); the materials for building on the male foundation. She is the leaven, or more expressively the oil to the vinegar of man: the second part of the book of man.\n\n\"Man singly is but half man; at least but half human; a king without a kingdom. Woman, who feels properly what she is, whether still or in motion, rests upon the man; nor is man what he may and ought to be, but in conjunction with woman; therefore, 'it is not good that man should be alone, but that he should leave father and mother, and cleave to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.'\n\nThey differ also in their exterior form and appearance.\n\n\"Man is the most firm; woman the most flexible. Man is the straightest; woman the most bending. Man stands steadfast; woman gently retreats. Man surveys and observes; woman glances and feels. Man is ferocious; woman is gay. Man is the tallest and broadest; woman the smallest and weakest. Man is rough and hard; woman smooth and soft. Man is brown; woman is fair. Man is wrinkled; woman is not. The hair of man is more strong and short; of woman more long and plaintive. The eyebrows of man are compressed; of woman less frowning. Man has most convex lines; woman most concave. Man has most straight lines; woman most curved. The countenance of man taken in profile is more seldom perpendicular than that of the woman. Man is most angular; woman most round.\"\n\nIn determining the comparative merit of the two sexes, it is no derogation from female excellency that it differs in kind from that which distinguishes the male part of our species; and if, in general, it should be found\nfound (what upon an impartial inquiry will most certainly be found) that women fill up their appointed circle of action with greater regularity than men, the claim of preference cannot justly be decided in our favour. In the prudential and economical parts of life, it is undeniable that they rise far above us; and if true fortitude of mind is best discovered by a cheerful resignation to the measures of Providence, we shall not find reason, perhaps, to claim that most singular of the human virtues as our peculiar privilege. There are numbers of the other sex who, from the natural delicacy of their constitution, pass through one continued scene of suffering from their cradles to their graves, with a firmness of resolution that would deserve so many statues to be erected to their memories, if heroism were not esteemed more by the splendor than the merit of actions.\n\nBut whatever real difference there may be between the moral or intellectual powers of the male and female mind, Nature does not seem to have marked the distinction so strongly as our vanity is willing to imagine; and after all, perhaps, education will be found to constitute the principal superiority. It must be acknowledged, at least, that in this article we have every advantage over the softer sex that art and industry can possibly secure to us. The most animating examples of Greece and Rome are set before us, as early as we are capable of any observation; and the noblest compositions of the ancients are given into our hands almost as soon as we have strength to hold them; while the employments of the other sex, at the same period of life, are generally the reverse of everything that can open and enlarge their minds, or fill them with just and rational notions. The truth of it is, female education is so much worse than none, as it is better to leave the mind to its natural and uninstructed suggestions, than to lead it into false pursuits, and contract its views, by turning them upon the lowest and most trifling objects. We seem, indeed, by the manner in which we suffer the youth of that sex to be trained, to consider women agreeably to the opinion of certain Mahometan doctors, and treat them as if we believed they had no souls: why else are they\n\nBred only, and completed to the taste\nOf lustful appetite, to sing, to dance,\nTo dress, and troul the tongue, and roll the eye.\n\nMilton.\n\nThis strange neglect of cultivating the female mind can hardly be allowed as good policy, when it is considered how much the interest of society is concerned in the rectitude of their understandings. That season of every man's life which is most susceptible of the strongest impressions, is necessarily under female direction; as there are few instances, perhaps, in which that sex is not one of the secret springs which regulates the most important movements of private or public transactions. What Cato observes of his countrymen is in one respect true of every nation under the sun: \"The Romans (said he) govern the world, but it is the women that govern the Romans.\"\n\nIf it be true then (as true beyond all peradventure it is) that female influence is thus extensive, nothing certainly can be of more importance than to give it a proper tendency, by the assistance of a well-directed education. Far are we from recommending any attempts to render women learned; yet surely it is necessary they should be raised above ignorance. Such a general tincture of the most useful sciences as may serve to free the mind from vulgar prejudices, and give it a relish for the rational exercise of its powers, might very justly enter into a plan of female education. That sex might be taught to turn the course of their reflections into a proper and advantageous channel, without any danger of rendering them too elevated for the feminine duties of life. In a word, they ought to be considered as designed by Providence for use as well as show, and trained up, not only as women, but as rational creatures.\n\nSEX of Bees. See Bee.\n\nSEX of Plants.

Also sexagenary tables are tables of proportional parts, showing the product of two sexagenaries that are to be multiplied, or the quotient of the two that are to be divided.\n\nSEXAGESIMA, the second Sunday before Lent, or the next to Shrove-Sunday; so called as being about the 6th day before Easter.\n\nSEXAGESIMALS, or SEXAGESIMAL Fractions, fractions whose denominators proceed in a sexaguple ratio; that is, a prime, or the first minute = \\(\\frac{1}{60}\\); a second = \\(\\frac{1}{3600}\\); a third = \\(\\frac{1}{216000}\\). Anciently, there were no other sexagesimals used in astronomy; and they are still retained in many cases, though decimal arithmetic begins to grow in the now in astronomical calculations. In these fractions, which some call astronomical fractions, the denominator being always 60, or a multiple thereof, is usually omitted, and the numerator only written down: thus \\(4^o\\), \\(59'\\), \\(32''\\), \\(50'''\\), \\(16''''\\) is to be read, 4 degrees, 59 minutes, 32 seconds, 50 thirds, 16 fourths, &c.\n\nSEXTANS, Sextant, a sixth part of certain things. The Romans having divided their as into 12 ounces or uncia, the sixth part of that, or two ounces, was the sextans—Sextans was also a measure which contained two ounces of liquor, or two cyathei.\n\nSEXTANS, in Astronomy, a constellation of the southern hemisphere, made by Helvelius out of unformed stars. In Helvelius's catalogue it contains 11, but in the Britannic catalogue 41 stars.\n\nSEXTANT, in Mathematics, denotes the sixth part of a circle, or an arch comprehending 60 degrees.\n\nThe word Sextant is more particularly used for an astronomical instrument made like a quadrant, excepting that its limb only comprehends 60 degrees. The use and application of the Sextant is the same with that of the Quadrant.

He seemed formed to rise in the republic; but he shrank from civil honours, and declined accepting the rank of senator when it was offered him by Julius Caesar, that he might have\nSEX\n\ntime to apply to philosophy. It appears that he wished to establish a school at Rome, and that his tenets, though chiefly drawn from the doctrines of Pythagoras, in some particulars resembled those of the Stoics.\n\nHe soon found himself involved in many difficulties. His laws were tinged with great severity; and in an early period of this establishment, he found his mind so harried, and the harshness of the doctrines which he wished to establish so repulsive to his feelings, that he had nearly worked himself up to such an height of desperation as to resolve on putting a period to his existence.\n\nOf the school of Sextius were Fabianus, Sotion, Flavianus, Crassius, and Celsius. Of his works only a few fragments remain; and whether any of them formed a part of the work which Senea admired so much, cannot now be determined. Some of his maxims are valuable. He recommended an examination of the actions of the day to his scholars when they retired to rest; he taught, that the road to heaven (ad astra) was by frugality, temperance, and fortitude. He used to recommend holding a looking glass before persons disordered with passion. He enjoined his scholars to abstain from animal food.\n\nSEXTON, a church-officer, thus called by corruption of the Latin sacrificio, or Sixon figerione, which denotes the same. His office is to take care of the vessels, vestments, &c. belonging to the church; and to attend the minister, church-warden, &c. at church. He is usually chosen by the parishioners only. Sextons, as well as parish clerks, are regarded by the common law as persons who have freehold in their offices; and, therefore, though they may be punished, yet they cannot be deprived, by ecclesiastical censures.\n\nThe office of sexton in the pope's chapel is appropriated to the order of the hermits of St. Augustine. He is generally a bishop, though sometimes the pope only gives a bishopric, in partibus, to him on whom he confers the mitre. He takes the title of Prefect of the Pope's Sacrifice, and has the keeping of the vessels of gold and silver, the relics, &c. When the pope says mass, the sexton always takes the bread and wine first. If it be in private he says mass, his holiness, of two wafers, gives him one to eat; and, if in public, the cardinal, who assists the pope in quality of deacon, of three wafers, gives him one to eat. When the pope is desperately sick, he administers to him the sacrament of extreme unction, &c. and enters the conclave in quality of first conclavist.\n\nThe office of a sexton in Sweden is sometimesingular. During M. Oathier's stay at Stockholm in 1736 he visited the church of St. Clara, and during divine service he observed a sexton going about with a long rod, waking those persons who had fallen asleep.\n\nSEXTUPLE, in Music, denotes a mixed sort of triple, which is beaten in double time.\n\nSEXTUS EMPIRICUS, a famous Pyrrhonian philosopher, lived in the second century, under the reign of Antoninus the Debonair. He was a physician of the sect of the Empirics, and is said to have been one of the preceptors of Antoninus the philosopher. There are still extant his Peripatian Institutions, and a large work against the mathematicians, &c. The best edition of Sextus Empiricus is that of Fabricius in Greek and Latin, printed at Leipzig in 1718, folio.\n\nSEXUALISTE, among botanical writers, those Sexualists who have established the classes of plants upon the differences of the sexes and parts of fructification in plants, according to the modern method; as Linnaeus, &c.\n\nSEZAWULI, a Hindoo word, used in Bengal to express an officer employed at a monthly salary to collect the revenues.\n\nSFORZA, JAMES, was the founder of the illustrious house of Sforza, which acted to conspicuous a part in Italy during the 15th and 16th centuries, which gave six dukes to Milan, and contracted alliances with almost every sovereign in Europe. James Sforza was born on the 28th of May 1369, at Catignola, a small town in Italy, lying between Imola and Faenza. His father was a day labourer, or, according to Comines, a shoemaker. A company of soldiers happening one day to pass through Catignola, he was seized with the desire of accompanying them to the wars. \"I will go (said he to himself), and dart my hatchet against that tree, and if it stick fast in the wood, I will immediately become a soldier.\" The hatchet accordingly stuck fast, and our adventurer enlisted; and because, says the Abbé de Choisy, he had thrown the axe with all his force, he assumed the name of Sforza; for his true name was Giacomuzzo, or James Attendulo. He rose rapidly in the army, and soon became commander of 7000 men. He defended the castle of Jane II. queen of Naples for many years, and was made countable of her kingdom. He was created Count of Catignola by Pope John XXII., by way of paying a debt of 14000 ducats which the church of Rome owed him. His exploits became every day more illustrious: He obliged Alphonso king of Arragon to raise the siege of Naples; and reduced several places that had revolted in Abruzzo and Le Labour; but while in pursuit of his enemies he was unfortunately drowned in the river Aterno on the 3rd January 1424, at the age of 54 years. His heroic qualities, and the continual wars in which he was engaged, did not prevent him from forming an attachment to the fair sex. In his youth he fell in love with a woman called Lucia Trezana, whom he married after she had borne him several children. He married afterwards Antoinette Salembini, who brought him several excellent estates; she bore him Bojio Sforza, comte of Santa-Maria, a warrior and governor of Orvietta for Pope Martin V. His third wife was Catherine Alopo, sister of Rodolpho, grand chamberlain to the sovereign of Naples. His last wife, for he was four times married, was Mary Marzana, daughter to the duke of Sella. She bore him Charles Sforza, who was general of the order of Augustines, and archbishop of Milan.\n\nSforza, Francis, the son of James Sforza by Lucia Trezana, was born in 1401, and trained up by his father to the profession of arms. At the age of 23 he defeated the troops of Braccio, who disputed with him the passage of the Aterno. In this action his father was drowned, and Francis, though illegitimate, succeeded him. He fought successfully against the Spaniards, and contributed a great deal both towards raising the siege of Naples, and to the victory which was gained over the troops of Braccio near Aquila in 1425, where that general was killed. After the death of Queen Jane, in 1435, he espoused the interests of the duke of Anjou, to whom she had left her crown, and by his courage and abilities ably supported that unfortunate\nfortunate prince. He made himself master of several places in Ancona, from which he was driven by Pope Eugenius IV. who defeated and excommunicated him; but he soon re-established his affairs by a victory. His reputation was now so great, that the pope, the Venetians, and the Florentines, chose him for their general against the duke of Milan. Sforza had already conducted Venetian armies against that prince, though he had eloped with his daughter. The duke dying in 1447, the inhabitants of Milan invited Sforza, his son-in-law, to lead them against that duke. But, after some exertions in their favour, he turned his arms against themselves, laid siege to Milan, and obliged them to receive him as duke, notwithstanding the rights of Charles duke of Orleans, the son of Valentine of Milan. In 1464, Louis XI., who hated Orleans, gave up to Sforza the rights which the crown of France had over Genoa, and even put into his hands Savona, a town belonging to that republic. The duke of Milan soon after made himself master of Genoa. He died in 1466, with the reputation of a man who was willing to sell his blood to the best purchaser, and who was not too scrupulous an observer of his word. His second wife was Blanche Marie, natural daughter of Philip Marie duke of Milan. She bore him Galeas Marie, and Ludovic Marie, dukes of Milan, Philip Marie count of Pavia, Sforza Marie duke of Bari, Acaque Marie bishop of Pavia and Cremona, and a cardinal. He was taken prisoner by the troops of Louis XII., and confined for some time in the tower of Bourges. He was a cunning man, and deceived Cardinal d'Amboise when that prelate aspired at the papacy. His daughters were Hypolita, married to Alphonso of Arragon, afterwards king of Naples; and Elizabeth, married to William marquis of Montferrat. He had besides several natural children.\n\nSHACK, in ancient customs, a liberty of winter-pasturage. In the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, the lord of the manor has shack, i.e. a liberty of feeding his sheep at pleasure in his tenants lands during the six winter months. In Norfolk, shack also extends to the common for hogs, in all men's grounds, from the end of harvest till feed-time. Whence to go a-shack, is to feed at large.\n\nSHACKLES, aboard a ship, are those oblong iron rings, bigger at one end than at the other, with which the ports are shut fast, by thrusting the wooden bar of the port through them.

The method is this: From the luminous body, which is here considered as a point, let fall a perpendicular to the perspective plane or table; i.e. find the appearance of a point upon which a perpendicular, drawn from the middle of the luminary, falls on the perspective plane; and from the several angles, or raised points of the body, let fall perpendiculars to the plane. These points, wherein the perpendiculars fall, connect by right lines, with the point upon which the perpendicular let fall from the luminary falls; and continue the lines to the side opposite to the luminary. Lastly, through the raised points draw lines through the centre of the luminary, intersecting the former; the points of intersection are the terms or bounds of the shadow.\n\nSHADOWS, Coloured, a curious phenomenon in optics, which was observed by Professor Scheffer of Vienna, and afterwards by Count Rumford, who made the discovery while prosecuting his experiments on light.\n\n\"Deformes,\" says the count, \"of comparing the intensity of the light of a clear blue sky by day with that of a common wax candle, I darkened my room, and letting the day-light from the north, coming through a hole near the top of the window-shutter, fall at an angle of about 75° upon a sheet of very fine white paper, I placed a burning wax candle in such a position that its rays fell upon the same paper, and, as near as I could guess, in the line of reflection of the rays of day-light from without; when, interposing a cylinder of wood, about half an inch in diameter, before the centre of the paper, and at the distance of about 2 inches from its surface, I was much surprised to find that the two shadows projected by the cylinder upon the paper, instead of being merely shades without colour, as I expected; the one of them, that which, corresponding with the beam of day-light, was illuminated by the candle, was yellow; while the other, corresponding to the light of the candle, and consequently illuminated by the light of the heavens, was of the most beautiful blue that it is possible to imagine. This appearance, which was not only unexpected, but was really in itself in the highest degree striking and beautiful, I found upon repeated trials, and after varying the experiment in every way I could think of, to be so perfectly permanent, that it is absolutely impossible to produce two shadows at the same time, from the same body, the one answering to a beam of day-light, and the other to the light of a candle or lamp, without those shadows being coloured, the one yellow, and the other blue.\n\n\"If the candle be brought nearer to the paper, the blue shadow will become of a deeper hue, and the yellow shadow will gradually grow fainter; but if it be removed farther off, the yellow shade will become of a deeper colour, and the blue shade will become fainter; and the candle remaining stationary in the same place, the same varieties in the strength of the tints of the coloured shadows may be produced merely by opening the window shutter a little more or less, and rendering the illumination of the paper, by the light from without, stronger or weaker. By either of these means, the coloured shadows may be made to pass through all the gradations of shade, from the deepest to the lightest, and\nSHAFTESBURY, a town of Dorsetshire in England, in W. Long. 2. 20. N. Lat. 51. 0. It stands on a high hill, and is built in the form of a bow. It enjoys a serene wholesome air, and has a fine prospect. It is a good thoroughfare, governed by a mayor, and sends two members to parliament. This town is supposed to have been built in the 8th century, and to have been enlarged by King Alfred; and had 12 churches, besides a Benedictine monastery, in the time of the Saxons, but has now only three. St Edward the martyr was buried here. It had three mints before the conquest, and, in the reign of Henry VIII, was the see of a suffragan bishop.\n\nSHAFTS, or Suffras, Gregory Savarof, an Armenian merchant, remarkable only as the person who sold the large and celebrated diamond which is now set in the imperial sceptre of Russia. Shah Nadir, an Indian prince, had two principal diamonds in his throne, one of them denominated the Sun of the Sea, and the other the Moon of the Mountain. When that prince was assassinated, many precious ornaments belonging to the crown were pillaged, and privately disposed of by the soldiers who shared the plunder. See DIAMOND, under MINERALOGY, where the account given of this diamond is somewhat different.\n\nShafras, who was called Millionik at Altracan, then had his residence at Baffora, with two of his brothers. A chief of the Armenians one day applied to him, and proposed to sell the diamond already mentioned for a very moderate sum (probably the Moon of the Mountain), together with a very large emerald, a ruby of considerable size, and other precious stones of less value. Shafras was astonished at the offer; and giving out that he had not a sufficient sum to purchase them, he requested time to consult with his brothers on the subject. The vender did not again make his appearance, probably from suspicious motives. Shafras, with the approbation of his brothers, went directly in search of the stranger with the jewels, but by that time he had left Baffora. Shafras, however, accidentally met him at Bagdad, and paid him 50,000 piastres (£933l. 6s. 8d.) for all his jewels. Shafras and his brothers being well aware that the most profound secrecy was absolutely necessary, resolved to remain at Baffora.\n\nAt the expiration of 12 years, Shafras set off with the largest of the jewels, directing his route through Sham and Constantinople, and afterwards through Hungary and Silegia to the city of Amsterdam by land, where he publicly offered them for sale.\n\nIt is reported that the British government was among the bidders. The Russian court sent for the large diamond, with an offer to reimburse all reasonable expenses, if the price could not be agreed on. When the diamond arrived, Count Patin, the Russian minister, made the following offer to Shafras. Besides the patent of hereditary nobility, which the vender demanded, he was to receive an annual pension of 6,000 rubles during life, 500,000 rubles in cash (112,500l. Sterling), one-fifth of which was to be payable on demand, and the remainder by instalments in the course of ten years. He also claimed the order of nobility for his brothers, persisting so obstinately in his demands, that the diamond was returned.\n\nShafras was now very much perplexed. He had involved himself in expenses, was forced to pay interest for considerable sums of borrowed money, and he saw no prospect of selling the jewel to advantage. The negotiation was recommenced with Russia by Count Gregory Grigorievitch Orloff, afterwards created a prince of the empire; and the diamond was purchased for 450,000 rubles (103,250l.) ready money, together with a grant of Russian nobility. We are informed that 120,000 rubles (27,000l.), fell to the share of the negociators, for commission, interest, and similar expenses. Shafras settled at Altracan; and his riches, which by inheritance devolved to his daughters, have been in a great measure dissipated by the extravagance of his sons-in-law.\n\nSHAFT of a Column, in Building, is the body thereof between the base and capital; so called from its straightness.

In the tin mines, after this is sunk about a fathom, they leave a little, long, square place, which is called a flambie.\n\nShafts are sunk some ten, some twenty fathoms deep into the earth, more or less. Of these shafts, there is the landing or working shaft, where they bring up the work or ore to the surface; but if it be worked by a horse engine or whim, it is called a whim-shaft; and where the water is drawn out of the mine, it is indifferently named an engine-shaft, or the rod-shaft.

Water is scarce, that it used to be supplied from Motcomb; but it was obtained more commodiously in 1718, by means of engines, which raised the water above 300 feet perpendicular, and conveyed it to a large cistern in the middle of the town, from the distance of two miles. Yet even this is laid aside, and they have dug several pits, in which they preserve the rain-water; and the poor get their living to this day by fetching it in pails or on horses.

See PELICANUS, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nSHAGREEN, or CHAGREEN, in Commerce, a kind of grained leather prepared of the skin of a species of Squalus, and much used in covering cases, books, &c.\n\nThe best is that brought from Constantinople, of a brownish colour; the white is the worst. It is extremely hard; yet, when steeped in water, it becomes very soft and pliable; whence it is of great use among case makers. It takes any colour that is given it, red, green, yellow, or black. It is frequently counterfeited by morocco, formed like shagreen; but this last is distinguished by its peeling off, which the first does not.\n\nThe following is the method of preparing shagreen, as it is described by Professor Pallas.\n\n\"All kinds of horses or asses' skins, which have been dressed in such a manner as to appear grained, are, by the Tartars, called sagrari, by the Persians sagri, and by the Turks sagri, from which the Europeans have made shagreen or chagrin. The Tartars who reside at Afrasiac, with a few of the Armenians of that city, are the only people in the Russian empire acquainted with the art of making shagreen. Those who follow this occupation not only gain considerable profit by the sale of their production to the Tartars of Cuban, African, and Casan, who ornament with it their Turkish leather boots, slippers, and other articles made of leather, but they derive considerable advantage from the great sale of horses' hides, which have undergone no other process than that of being scraped clean, and of which several thousands are annually exported, at the rate of from 75 to 85 roubles per hundred, to Persia, where there is a scarcity of such hides, and from which the greater part of the shagreen manufactured in that country is prepared. The hind part only of the hide; however, which is cut out in the form of a crescent about a Russian ell and a half in length across the loins, and a short ell in breadth along the back, can properly be employed for shagreen. The remaining part, as is proved by experience, is improper for that purpose, and is therefore rejected.\n\n\"The preparation of the skins, after being cut into the above form, is as follows.—They are deposited in a tub filled with pure water, and suffered to remain there for several days, till they are thoroughly soaked, and the hair has dropped off. They are then taken from the tub, one by one, extended on boards placed in an oblique direction against a wall, the corners of them, which reach beyond the edges of the board, being made fast, and the hair with the epidermis is then scraped off with a blunt iron scraper called urak. The skins thus cleaned are again put in pure water to soak. When all the skins have undergone this part of the process, they are taken from the water a second time, spread out one after the other as before, and the flesh side is scraped with the same kind of instrument. They are carefully cleaned also on the hair side, so that nothing remains but the pure fibrous tissue, which serves for making parchment, consisting of coats of white medullary fibres, and which has a resemblance to a swine's bladder softened in water.\n\n\"After this preparation, the workmen take a certain kind of frames called palici, made of a straight and a semicircular piece of wood, having nearly the same form as the skins. On these the skins are extended in as smooth and even a manner as possible by means of cords; and during the operation of extending them, they are several times sprinkled with water, that no part of them may be dry, and occasion an unequal tension. After they have been all extended on the frames, they are again moistened, and carried into the house, where the frames are deposited close to each other on the floor with the flesh side of the skin next the ground. The upper side is then thickly besprewed with the black exceedingly smooth and hard seeds of a kind of goose foot (Chenopodium album), which the Tartars call alabuta, and which grows in abundance, to about the height of a man, near the gardens and farms on the south side of the Volga; and that they may make a strong impression on the skins, a piece of felt is spread over them, and the seeds are trod down with the feet, by which means they are deeply imprinted into the soft skins. The frames, without shaking the seeds, are then carried out into the open air, and placed in a reclining position against a wall to dry, the side covered with the seeds being next the wall, in order that it may be sheltered from the sun. In this state the skins must be left several days to dry in the sun, until no appearance of moisture is observed in them, when they are fit to be taken from the frames. When the impressed seeds are beat off from the hair side, it appears full of indentations or inequalities, and has acquired that impression which is to produce the grain of the shagreen, after the skins have been subjected to the last smoothing or scraping, and have been dipped in a ley, which will be mentioned hereafter, before they receive the dye.\n\n\"The operation of smoothing is performed on an inclined bench or board, which is furnished with an iron hook, and is covered with thick felt of sheep's wool, on which the dry skin may gently rest. The skin is suspended in the middle of the bench or board to its iron hook, by means of one of the holes made in the edge of the skin for extending it in its frame as before mentioned; and a cord, having at its extremity a stone or a weight, is attached to each end of the skin, to keep it in its position while under the hands of the workman. It is then subjected to the operation of smoothing and scraping by means of two different instruments. The first used for this purpose, called by the Tartars tobar, is a piece of sharp iron bent like a hook, with which the surface of the shagreen is pretty closely scraped to remove all the projecting inequalities. This...\"\nThis operation, on account of the cornous hardness of the dry skin, is attended with some difficulty; and great caution is at the same time required that too much of the impression of the alabuta seed be not destroyed, which might be the case if the iron were kept too sharp. As the iron, however, is pretty blunt, which occasions inequalities on the shagreen, this inconvenience must afterwards be remedied by means of a sharp scraping iron or urak, by which the surface acquires a perfect uniformity, and only faint impressions of the alabuta seed then remain, and such as the workman wishes. After all these operations, the shagreen is again put into water, partly to make it pliable, and partly to raise the grain. As the seeds occasion indentations on the surface of the skin, the intermediate spaces, by the operations of smoothing and scraping, lose some part of their projecting substance; but the points which have been depressed, and which have lost none of their substance, now swell up above the scraped parts, and thus form the grain of the shagreen. To produce this effect, the skins are left to soak in water for 24 hours; after which they are immersed several times in a strong warm ley, obtained by boiling, from a strong alkaline earth named fehora, which is found in great abundance in the neighbourhood of Afracan. When the skins have been taken from this ley, they are piled up, while warm, on each other, and suffered to remain in that state several hours; by which means they swell, and become soft. They are then left 24 hours in a moderately strong pickle of common salt, which renders them exceedingly white and beautiful, and fit for receiving any colour. The colour most usual for these skins is a sea-green; but old experienced workmen can dye them blue, red, or black, and even make white shagreen.\n\nFor the green colour nothing is necessary but filings of copper and sal ammoniac. Sal ammoniac is dissolved in water till the water is completely saturated; and the shagreen skins, still moist, after being taken from the pickle, are washed over with the solution on the ungrained flesh side, and when well moistened a thick layer of copper filings is strewed over them: the skins are then folded double, so that the side covered with the filings is innermost. Each skin is then rolled up in a piece of felt; the rolls are all ranged together in proper order, and they are pressed down in an uniform manner by some heavy bodies placed over them, under which they remain 24 hours. During that period, the solution of sal ammoniac dissolves a quantity of the cuprous particles sufficient to penetrate the skin, and to give it a sea-green colour. If the first application be not sufficient, the process is repeated in the same manner; after which the skins are spread out and dried.\n\nFor the blue dye, indigo is used. About two pounds of it, reduced to a fine powder, are put into a kettle; cold water is poured over it, and the mixture is stirred round till the colour begins to be dissolved. Five pounds of pounded alakar, which is a kind of barilla or crude soda, prepared by the Armenians and Calmues, is then dissolved in it, with two pounds of lime and a pound of pure honey, and the whole is kept several days in the sun, and during that time frequently stirred round. The skins intended to be dyed blue must be moistened only in the natrous ley fehora, but not in the salt brine. When still moist, they are folded up and sewed together at the edge, the flesh side being innermost, and the shagreened hair side outwards; after which they are dipped three times in the remains of an exhausted kettle of the same dye, the superfluous dye being each time expressed; and after this process they are dipped in the fresh dye prepared as above, which must not be expressed. The skins are then hung up in the shade to dry; after which they are cleaned and paired at the edges.\n\nFor black shagreen, gall nuts and vitriol are employed in the following manner:—The skins, moist from the pickle, are thickly befriended with finely pulverized gall nuts. They are then folded together, and laid over each other for 24 hours. A new ley, of bitter saline earth or fehora, is in the mean time prepared, and poured hot into small troughs. In this ley each skin is several times dipped; after which they are again befriended with pounded gall nuts, and placed in heaps for a certain period, that the galls may thoroughly penetrate them, and they are dried and beat, to free them from the dust of the galls. When this is done, they are rubbed over, on the shagreen side, with melted sheep's tallow, and exposed a little in the sun, that they may imbibe the grease. The shagreen makers are accustomed also to roll up each skin separately, and to press or squeeze it with their hands against some hard substance, in order to promote the absorption of the tallow. The superfluous particles are removed by means of a blunt wooden scraper (urce); and when this process is finished, and the skins have lain some time, a sufficient quantity of vitriol of iron is dissolved in water, with which the shagreen is moistened on both sides, and by this operation it acquires a beautiful black dye. It is then dressed at the edges, and in other places where there are any blemishes.\n\nTo obtain white shagreen, the skins must first be moistened on the shagreen side with a strong solution of alum. When the skin has imbibed this liquor, it is daubed over on both sides with a paste made of flour, which is suffered to dry. The paste is then washed off with alum water, and the skin is placed in the sun till it is completely dry. As soon as it is dry, it is gently befriended with pure melted sheep's tallow, which it is suffered to imbibe in the sun; and to promote the effect, it is pressed and worked with the hands. The skins are then fastened in succession to the before-mentioned bench, where warm water is poured over them, and the superfluous fat is scraped off with a blunt wooden instrument. In the last operation the warm water is of great service. In this manner shagreen perfectly white is obtained, and nothing remains but to pare the edges and dress it.\n\nBut this white shagreen is not intended so much for remaining in that state, as for receiving a dark red dye; because, by the above previous process, the colour becomes much more perfect. The skins destined for a red colour must not be immersed first in ley of bitter salt earth (fehora), and then in pickle, but after they have been whitened, must be left to soak in the pickle for 24 hours. The dye is prepared from cochineal, which the Tartars call kirmiz. About a pound of the dried herb tchagann, which grows in great abundance in the neighbourhood of Afracan, and is a kind\nShagreen of soda plant or kali (Jalapa ericoides) (A), is boiled a full hour in a kettle containing about four common pailfuls of water; by which means the water acquires a greenish colour. The herb is then taken out, and about half a pound of pounded cochineal is put into the kettle, and the liquor is left to boil a full hour, care being taken to stir it that it may not run over. About 15 or 20 drams of a substance which the dyers call luter (or chilla) is added, and when the liquor has been boiled for some time longer, the kettle is removed from the fire. The skins taken from the pickle are then placed over each other in troughs, and the dye-liquor is poured over them four different times, and rubbed into them with the hands, that the colour may be equally imbibed and diffused. The liquor each time is exprested; after which they are fit for being dried. Skins prepared in this manner are sold at a much dearer rate than any of the other kinds.\n\nSHAIF properly signifies an old man. In the east it is used to denote a lord or chief, a man of eminence and property. See SCHICHS.\n\nSHAKE, in fingering. See TRILL.\n\nSHAKESPEARE, or SHAKESPEARE, William, the prince of dramatic writers, was born at Stratford upon Avon in Warwickshire, on the 23rd of April 1564. From the register of that town, it appears that a plague broke out there on the 30th of June following, which raged with great violence; but fortunately it did not reach the house in which this infant prodigy lay. His father, John Shakespear, enjoyed a small patrimonial estate, and was a considerable dealer in wool; his mother was the daughter and heir of Robert Arden of Wellingcote. Our illustrious poet being designed for the business of his father, received no better education than the instructions which the free-school of Stratford could afford. After applying some time to the study of Latin, he was called home to assist his father, who seems by some accident to have been reduced in his circumstances. Before arriving at the age of 19, he married the daughter of Mr Hathaway, a substantial yeoman in the neighbourhood of Stratford. This lady was eight years older than her husband. Having the misfortune to fall into bad company, he was seduced into some profligate actions, which drew on him a criminal prosecution, and at length forced him to take refuge in the capital. In concert with his associates, he broke into a park belonging to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, and carried off some of his deer. Every admirer of Shakespeare will regret that such a blemish should have stained his character; but, perhaps, if anything can extenuate his guilt, we might ascribe it to the opinions of the age, which, perhaps, as was formerly the case in Scotland, might not distinguish the killing of deer by any mark of disgrace, or any charge of criminality. One thing at least is certain, that Shakespeare himself thought that the prosecution which Sir Thomas raised against him was carried on with too great severity; an opinion which he could not have entertained had this action been at that time viewed in the same criminal light as it is at present. Shakespeare testified his resentment against Sir Thomas, by writing a satirical ballad, which exaggerated him so much, that the process was carried on with redoubled violence; and the young poet, in order to avoid the punishment of the law, was obliged to make his escape. This ballad would be considered as a curious relic, on account of its being the first production of Shakespeare; it would also be interesting to peruse a poem which could irritate the baronet to so high a degree. Tradition has preserved the first stanza:\n\nA parlament member, a justice of peace,\nAt home a poor scarecrow, at London an ass.\nIf lowly is Lucy, as some volke nifcalle it,\nThen Lucy is lowly whatever befell it:\nHe thinks himselfe greate,\nYet an ass in his state,\nWe allowe by his ears, but with asses to mate.\nIf Lucy is lowly, as some volke nifcalle it,\nSing lowly Lucy whatever befell it.\n\nIf the rest of the ballad was of a piece with this stanza, it might assist us to form some opinion of the irritability of the baronet, but will enable us to form no idea of the opening genius of Shakespeare.\n\nThus expelled from his native village, he repaired to London, where he was glad to accept a subordinate office in the theatre. It has been said that he was first engaged, while the play was acting, in holding the horses of those who rode to the theatre; but this story rests on a slender foundation. As his name is found printed among those of the other players before some old plays, it is probable that he was some time employed as an actor; but we are not informed what characters he played; we are only told, that the part which he acted best was that of the Ghost in Hamlet; and that he appeared in the character of Adam in As you like it. If the names of the actors prefixed to Ben Jonson's play of Every Man in his Humour were arranged in the same order as the persons represented, which is very probable, Shakespeare played the part of Old Knowell. We have reason therefore to suppose, as far as we can argue from these few facts, that he generally represented old men. See Malone's Chronology, in his edition of Shakespeare.\n\nBut though he was not qualified to shine as an actor, he was now in the situation which could most effectually rouse those latent sparks of genius which afterwards burst forth with so resplendent a flame. Being well acquainted with the mechanical business of the theatre and the taste of the times; possessed of a knowledge of the characters of men resembling intuition, an imagination that ranged at large through nature, selecting the grand, the sublime, and the beautiful; a judicious caution, that disposed him to prefer those plots which had already been found to please; an uncommon fluency\n\n(A) The beautiful red Turkey leather is dyed with cochineal prepared in the same manner. Professor Gmelin junior, in the second part of his Travels through Russia, explains the herb schogann by artemisia annua, having doubts been deceived by the appearance the plant acquires after it has been dried. Besides, this artemisia is found only in the middle of Siberia, and never on the west side of the Irtitch.\nfluency and force of expression; he was qualified at once to eclipse all who had gone before him.\n\nNotwithstanding the unrivalled genius of Shakespeare, most of his plots were the invention of others; which, however, he certainly much improved, if he did not entirely new-model. We are assured, that prior to the theatrical compositions of Shakespeare, dramatic pieces were written on the following subjects, viz. King John, King Richard II. and III., King Henry IV. and V., King Henry VIII., King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, Measure for Measure, the Merchant of Venice, the Taming of a Shrew, and the Comedy of Errors.\n\nAmong his patrons, the earl of Southampton is particularly honoured by him, in the dedication of two poems, Venus and Adonis, and Lucrece; in the latter especially, he expressed himself in such terms as gives countenance to what is related of that patron's distinguished generosity to him. In the beginning of King James I.'s reign (if not sooner) he was one of the principal managers of the playhouse, and continued in it several years afterwards; till, having acquired such a fortune as satisfied his moderate wishes and views in life, he quitted the stage, and all other bufettes, and passed the remainder of his time in an honourable estate, at his native town of Stratford, where he lived in a handsome house of his own purchasing, to which he gave the name of New Place; and he had the good fortune to save it from the flames in the dreadful fire that consumed the greatest part of the town in 1614.\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1616, he made his will, wherein he testified his respect to his quondam partners in the theatre: he appointed his youngest daughter, jointly with her husband, his executors, and bequeathed to them the best part of his estate, which they came into the possession of not long after. He died on the 23rd of April following, being the 53rd year of his age; and was interred among his ancestors on the north side of the chancel, in the great church of Stratford, where there is a handsome monument erected for him, inscribed with the following elegiac distich in Latin:\n\nJudicio Pylium, genio Socratem, arte Maronem,\nTerra tegit, Populus moret, Olympus habet.\n\nIn the year 1749, another very noble one was raised to his memory, at the public expense, in Westminster abbey; an ample contribution for this purpose being made upon exhibiting his tragedy of Julius Caesar, at the theatre-royal in Drury-Lane, April 28th 1738.\n\nNor must we omit mentioning another testimony of the veneration paid to his names by the public in general, which is, that a mulberry-tree planted upon his estate by the hands of this revered bard, was cut down not many years ago; and the wood being converted to several domestic uses, was all eagerly bought at a high price, and each single piece treasured up by its purchaser as a precious memorial of the planter.\n\nThe character of Shakespeare as a dramatic writer has been often drawn, but perhaps never with more accuracy than by the pen of Dr Johnson: \"Shakespeare (says he) is above all writers, at least above all modern writers, the poet of nature; the poet that holds up to his readers a faithful mirror of manners and of life. His characters are not modified by the customs of particular places, unpractised by the rest of the world; by the peculiarities of studies or professions, which can operate but upon small numbers; or by the accidents of transient fashions or temporary opinions: they are the genuine progeny of common humanity, such as the world will always supply, and observation will always find. His persons act and speak by the influence of those general passions and principles by which all minds are agitated, and the whole system of life is continued in motion. In the writings of other poets, a character is too often an individual; in those of Shakespeare, it is commonly a species.\n\n\"It is from this wide extension of design that so much instruction is derived. It is this which fills the plays of Shakespeare with practical axioms and domestic wisdom. It was said of Euripides, that every verse was a precept; and it may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be collected a system of civil and economical prudence. Yet his real power is not shown in the splendor of particular passages, but by the progress of his fable, and the tenor of his dialogue; and he that tries to recommend him by select quotations, will succeed like the pedant in Hierocles, who, when he offered his house to sale, carried a brick in his pocket as a specimen.\n\n\"Upon every other stage the universal agent is love, by whose power all good and evil is distributed, and every action quickened or retarded. But love is only one of many passions; and as it has no great influence upon the sum of life, it has little operation in the dramas of a poet who caught his ideas from the living world, and exhibited only what he saw before him. He knew that any other passion, as it was regular or exorbitant, was a cause of happiness or calamity.\n\n\"Characters thus ample and general were not easily discriminated and preserved; yet perhaps no poet ever kept his personages more distinct from each other.\n\n\"Other dramatists can only gain attention by hyperbolical or aggravated characters, by fabulous and unexampled excellence or depravity, as the writers of barbarous romances invigorated the reader by a giant and a dwarf; and he that should form his expectations of human affairs from the play, or from the tale, would be equally deceived. Shakespeare has no heroes, his scenes are occupied only by men, who act and speak as the reader thinks that he should himself have spoken or acted on the same occasion: Even where the agency is supernatural, the dialogue is level with life. Other writers disguise the most natural passions and most frequent incidents; so that he who contemplates them in the book will not know them in the world: Shakespeare approximates the remote, and familiarizes the wonderful; the event which he represents will not happen, but if it were possible, its effects would probably be such as he has assigned; and it may be said, that he has not only shown human nature as it acts in real exigencies, but as it would be found in trials to which it cannot be exposed.\n\n\"This therefore is the praise of Shakespeare, that his drama is the mirror of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in following the phantoms which other writers raise up before him, may here be cured of his delirious ecstasies, by reading human sentiments in human language: by scenes from which a hermit may effi...\nmate the transfigurations of the world, and a confessor predict the progress of the passions.\"\n\nThe learning of Shakespeare has frequently been a subject of inquiry. That he possessed much classical knowledge does not appear, yet he was certainly acquainted with the Latin poets, particularly with Terence, as Colman has justly remarked, which appears from his using the word thrafonical. Nor was he unacquainted with French and Italian. We are indeed told, that the pallages in which these languages occur might be imperious additions of the players; but is it probable, that any of the players so far surpassed Shakespeare?\n\nThat much knowledge is scattered over his works is very justly observed by Pope; but it is often such knowledge as books did not supply. \"There is, however, proof enough (says Dr Johnson) that he was a very diligent reader; nor was our language then so indigent of books, but that he might very liberally indulge his curiosity without excursion into foreign literature. Many of the Roman authors were translated, and some of the Greek; the Reformation had filled the kingdom with theological learning; most of the topics of human disquisition had found English writers; and poetry had been cultivated, not only with diligence, but success. This was a flock of knowledge sufficient for a mind so capable of appropriating and improving it.\"\n\nThe works of Shakespeare consist of 35 dramatic pieces. The following is the chronological order which Mr Malone has endeavoured to establish, after a minute investigation, in which he has in general been successful:\n\n1. First Part of King Henry VI. - 1589\n2. Second Part of King Henry VI. - 1591\n3. Third Part of King Henry VI. - 1591\n4. A Midsummer Night's Dream - 1592\n5. Comedy of Errors - 1593\n6. Taming of the Shrew - 1594\n7. Love's Labour Lost - 1594\n8. Two Gentlemen of Verona - 1595\n9. Romeo and Juliet - 1595\n10. Hamlet - 1596\n11. King John - 1596\n12. King Richard II. - 1597\n13.

Timon of Athens - 1609\n32. Coriolanus - 1610\n33. Othello - 1611\n34. The Tempest - 1612\n35. Twelfth Night - 1614\n\nThe first three of these, Mr Malone thinks, there is very strong reason to believe are not the original productions of Shakespeare; but that he probably altered them, and added some new scenes.\n\nIn the first folio edition in 1623, these plays were entitled \"Mr William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies.\" They have been published by various editors. The first folio edition by Isaac Jaggard and Edward Blount; the second, folio, 1632, by Thomas Cotes for Robert Allot; the third, 1664, for P.C.; the fourth, 1685, for H. Herringman, E. Brewster, and R. Bentley. Rowe published an 8vo edition in 1709, in 7 vols, and a 12mo edition in 1714, in 9 vols, for which he received 36l. 10s. Pope published a 4to edition in 1725, in 6 vols, and a 12mo in 1728, in 10 vols; for which he was paid 217l. 12s. Theobald gave a new edition in 8vo in 1733, in 7 vols, another in 12mo in 1740, in 8 vols; and received for his labour 652l. 10s. Sir Thomas Hanmer published an edition in 1744, in 6 vols 4to. Dr Warburton's 8vo edition came out in 1747, in 8 vols; for which he was paid 560l. The editions published since that time, are Dr Johnson's in 1765, in 8 vols 8vo. Stevens's in 1766, in 4 vols 8vo. Capell's in 1768, in 10 vols, crown 8vo; for this the author was paid 300l. A second edition of Hanmer's in 1771, 6 vols. Johnson's and Stevens's in 1773, in 10 vols 8vo; a second edition in 1778; a third by Reed in 1785; and Malone's crown 8vo edition in 1789, in 10 vols.\n\nThe most authentic of the old editions is that of 1623. \"At last (says Dr Johnson) an edition was undertaken by Rowe; not because a poet was to be published by a poet, for Rowe seems to have thought very little on correction or explanation, but that our author's works might appear like those of his fraternity, with the appendages of a life and recommendatory preface. Rowe has been clamorously blamed for not performing what he did not undertake; and it is time that justice be done him, by confessing, that though he seems to have had no thought of corruption beyond the printer's errors, yet he has made many emendations, if they were not made before, which his successors have received without acknowledgment, and which, if they had produced them, would have filled pages with censures of the stupidity by which the faults were committed, with displays of the absurdities which they involved, with ostentatious expositions of the new reading, and self-congratulations on the happiness of discovering it.\"\n\nThe nation had been for many years content enough with Mr Rowe's performance, when Mr Pope made them acquainted with the true state of Shakespeare's text, showed that it was extremely corrupt, and gave reason to hope that there were means of reforming it. Mr Pope's edition, however, he observes, fell below his own expectations; and he was so much offended, when he was found to have left anything for others to do, that he passed the latter part of his life in a state of hostility with verbal criticism.\n\nThe only task, in the opinion of Mr Malone, for which Pope was eminently and indisputably qualified,\nwas to mark the faults and beauties of his author. When he undertook the office of a commentator, every anomaly of language, and every expression that was currently in use, were considered as errors or corruptions, and the text was altered or amended, as it was called, at pleasure. Pope is openly charged with being one of the great corruptors of Shakespeare's text.\n\nPope was succeeded by Theobald, who collated the ancient copies, and rectified many errors. He was, however, a man of narrow comprehension and of little learning, and what is worse, in his reports of copies and editions, he is not to be trusted without examination. From the liberties taken by Pope, the edition of Theobald was justly preferred, because he professed to adhere to the ancient copies more strictly, and illustrated a few passages by extracts from the writers of our poet's age. Still, however, he was a considerable innovator; and while a few arbitrary changes made by Pope were detected, innumerable sophifications were silently adopted.\n\nSir Thomas Hanmer, who comes next, was a man of critical abilities, and of extensive learning. His corrections are commonly just, but sometimes capricious. He is censurable, too, for receiving without examination almost all the innovations of Pope.\n\nThe original and predominant error of Warburton's commentary, is acquiescence in his first thoughts; that precipitation which is produced by confusion of quick discernment; and that confidence which presumes to do, by surveying the surface, what labour only can perform, by penetrating to the bottom. His notes exhibit sometimes perverse interpretations, and sometimes improbable conjectures; he at one time gives the author more profundity of meaning than the sentence admits, and at another discovers absurdities where the sense is plain to every other reader. But his emendations are likewise often happy and just; and his interpretation of obscure passages learned and sagacious.\n\nIt has indeed been said by his defenders, that his great object was to display his own learning; and certainly, in spite of the clamour raised against him for substituting his own chimerical conceits instead of the genuine text of Shakespeare, his work increased his reputation. But as it is of little value as a commentary on Shakespeare, since Warburton is now gone, his work will probably soon sink into oblivion.\n\nIn 1765 Dr Johnson's edition, which had long been impatiently expected, was given to the public. His vigorous and comprehensive understanding threw more light on his author than all his predecessors had done. The character which he gave of each play is generally just. His refutation of the false glosses of Theobald and Warburton, and his numerous explications of involved and difficult passages, entitle him to the gratitude of every admirer of Shakespeare.\n\nThe last editor is Mr Malone, who was eight years employed in preparing his edition. By collating the most authentic copies, he has been careful to purify the text. He has been so industrious, in order to discover the meaning of the author, that he has ransacked many volumes, and truths that, besides his additional illustrations, not a single valuable explication of any obscure passage in these plays has ever appeared, which he has not inserted in his edition. He rejects Titus Andronicus, as well as the three plays formerly mentioned, as not being the authentic productions of Shakespeare. To the whole he has added an appendix, and a copious glossary.—Of this work a less expensive edition has been published in 7 vols 12mo, in which the general introductory observations prefixed to the different plays are preserved, and the numerous notes abridged.\n\nThis judicious commentator has certainly done more for the elucidation and correction of Shakespeare than all who came before him, and has followed with indefatigable patience the only road which a commentator of Shakespeare ought to observe.\n\nWithin 30 years after our poet's death, Dryden says that he became \"a little obsolete;\" and in the beginning of the 18th century Lord Shaftesbury complains of his rude unpolished style, and his antiquated phrase and wit. These complaints were owing to the great revolution which the English language has undergone, and to the want of an enlightened commentator. These complaints are now removed, for an enlightened commentator has been found in Mr Malone.\n\nWe have only farther to add, that in the year 1790 a copious index to the remarkable passages and words in the plays of Shakespeare was published by the Reverend Mr Aykough; a gentleman to whom the literary world is much indebted for several very valuable keys of knowledge. In fine, the admirers of Shakespeare are now, by the labours of several eminent men, furnished with every help that can enable them to understand the sense and to taste the beauties of this illustrious poet.\n\nSHAKLES. See SHACKLES.\n\nSHALE, in Mineralogy, a kind of Schistus, of a black colour and flaky structure, or a clay hardened into a stony concretion, and so much impregnated with bitumen that it becomes somewhat like a coal. The acid emitted from shale, during its calcination, uniting itself to the argillaceous earth of the shale, forms alum. About 120 tons of calcined shale will make one ton of alum. The shale, after being calcined, is steeped in water, by which means the alum, which is formed during the calcination of the shale, is dissolved; this dissolved alum undergoes various operations before it is formed into the alum of the shops.

They pretend likewise to chiromancy, and to foretel a man's good or ill success by the lines of his\nShambles, his hand.

It is prepared from the skin of the chamois, or thamois, a kind of rupicapra, or wild goat, called also ifard, inhabiting the mountains of Dauphiny, Savoy, Piedmont, and the Pyrenees. Besides the softness and warmth of the leather, it has the faculty of bearing soap without damage; which renders it very useful in many accounts.\n\nIn France, &c. some wear the skin raw, without any preparation. Shammy leather is used for the purifying of mercury, which is done by passing it through the pores of this skin, which are very close. The true chamois leather is counterfeited with common goat, kid, and even with sheep skins, the practice of which makes a particular profession, called by the French chamoisure. The last, though the least esteemed, is yet so popular, and such vast quantities of it are prepared, especially about Orleans, Mareilles, and Thoulouse, that it may be proper to give the method of preparation.\n\nManner of flamoising, or of preparing sheep, goat, or kid skins in oil, in imitation of shammy.—The skins, being washed, drained, and smeared over with quicklime on the fleecy side, are folded in two lengthwise, the wool outwards, and laid in heaps, and so left to ferment eight days, or, if they had been left to dry after flaying, then fifteen days.\n\nThen they are washed out, drained, and half dried; laid on a wooden leg, or horse, the wool stripped off with a round fluff for that purpose, and laid in a weak pit, the lime whereof had been used before, and has lost the greatest part of its force.\n\nAfter 24 hours they are taken out, and left to drain 24 more; they are then put in another stronger pit. This done, they are taken out, drained, and put in again, by turns; which begins to dispense them to take oil; and this practice they continue for six weeks in summer, or three months in winter: at the end whereof they are washed out, laid on the wooden leg, and the surface of the skin on the wool side peeled off, to render them the softer; then made into parcels, steeped a night in the river, in winter more, stretched five or seven over one another on the wooden leg, and the knife passed strongly on the flesh side, to take off any thing superfluous, and render the skin smooth. Then they are steeped, as before, in the river, and the same operation is repeated on the wool side; they are then thrown into a tub of water, with bran in it, which is brewed among the skins till the greatest part sticks to them, and then separated into distinct tubs, till they fowell, and rise of themselves above the water. By this means the remains of the lime are cleared out; they are then wrung out, hung up to dry on ropes, and sent to the mill, with the quantity of oil necessary to scour them: the best oil is that of stock-fish. Here they are first thrown in bundles into the river for 12 hours, then laid in the mill-trough, and fulled without oil till they be well softened; then oiled with the hand, one by one, and thus Shamois formed into parcels of four skins each; which are milked and dried on cords a second time; then a third; and then oiled again, and dried. This process is repeated as often as necessity requires; when done, if there be any moisture remaining, they are dried in a flove, and made up into parcels wrapped up in wool; after some time they are opened to the air, but wrapped up again as before, till such time as the oil seems to have lost all its force, which it ordinarily does in 24 hours. The skins are then returned from the mill to the chamoiser to be scoured; which is done by putting them in a lixivium of wood-ashes, working and beating them in it with poles, and leaving them to steep till the ley bath had its effect; then they are wrung out, steeped in another lixivium, wrung again; and this is repeated till all the grease and oil be purged out. When this is done, they are half dried, and pulled over a sharp-edged iron instrument, placed perpendicular in a block, which opens, softens, and makes them gentle. Lastly, they are thoroughly dried, and passed over the same instrument again; which finishes the preparation, and leaves them in form of shammy.\n\nKid and goat skins are chamoised in the same manner as those of sheep, excepting that the hair is taken off without the use of any lime; and that when brought from the mill they undergo a particular preparation called ramalling, the most delicate and difficult of all the others. It consists in this, that, as soon as brought from the mill, they are steeped in a fit lixivium, taken out, stretched on a round wooden leg, and the hair is scraped off with the knife; this makes them smooth, and in working to cast a kind of fine knap. The difficulty is in scraping them evenly.\n\nSHANK, or SHANK-Painter, in a ship, is a short chain fastened under the foremast threads, by a bolt, to the ship's sides, having at the other end a rope fastened to it. On this shank-painter the whole weight of the aft part of the anchor rests, when it lies by the ship's side. The rope, by which it is hauled up, is made fast about a timber-head.\n\nSHANK, in the manege, that part of a horse's fore leg which lies between the knee and the fetlock.\n\nSHANKER, or CHANCER, in Medicine, a malignant ulcer, usually occasioned by some venereal disorder. See MEDICINE, No. 350.\n\nSHANNON, the largest river in Ireland, and one of the finest in the British dominions, not only on account of its rolling 200 miles, but also of its great depth in most places, and the gentleness of its current, by which it might be made exceedingly serviceable to the improvement of the country, the communication of its inhabitants, and consequently the promoting of inland trade, through the greatest part of its long course. But the peculiar prerogative of the Shannon is its situation, running from north to south, and separating the province of Connaught from Leinster and Munster, and of consequence dividing the greatest part of Ireland into what lies on the east and that on the west of the river; watering in its passage the valuable county of Leitrim, the plentiful shire of Roscommon, the fruitful county of Galway, and the pleasant county of Clare; the small but fine shire of Longford, the King's county, and fertile county of Meath in Leinster, the populous county of Tipperary, the spacious shire of Limerick,\nSharp sent over to the king at Breda to procure from him, if possible, the establishment of presbyterianism. On his return, he affirmed his friends that \"he had found the king very affectionate to Scotland, and resolved not to wrong the settled government of the church: but he apprehended they were mistaken who went about to establish the presbyterian government.\"\n\nCharles was soon after restored without any terms. All the laws passed in Scotland since the year 1633 were repealed; the king and his ministers resolved at all hazards to restore prelacy. Mr Sharp, who had been commissioned by the Scotch presbyterians to manage their interests with the king, was prevailed upon to abandon the party; and, as a reward for his compliance, he was made archbishop of St Andrew's. This conduct rendered him very odious in Scotland; he was accused of treachery and perfidy, and reproached by his old friends as a traitor and renegade. The absurd and wanton cruelties which were afterwards committed, and which were imputed in a great measure to the archbishop, rendered him still more detested. Nor is it probable that these accusations were without foundation: the very circumstance of his having been formerly of the presbyterian party would induce him, after forsaking them, to treat them with severity. Besides, it is certain, that when after the rout at Pentland-hills he received an order from the king to stop the executions, he kept it for some time before he produced it to council.\n\nThere was one Mitchell a preacher, and a desperate fanatic, who had formed the design of taking vengeance for these cruelties by assassinating the archbishop. He fired a pistol at him as he was sitting in his coach; but the bishop of Orkney, lifting up his hand at the moment, intercepted the ball. Though this happened in the midst of Edinburgh, the primate was so much detested, that nobody stopped the assassin; who, having walked leisurely home, and thrown off his disguise, returned, and mixed unsuspiciously with the crowd. Some years after, the archbishop observing a man eyeing him with keenness, suspected that he was the assassin, and ordered him to be brought before him. It was Mitchell. Two loaded pistols were found in his pocket. The primate offered him a pardon if he would confess the crime; the man complied; but Sharp, regardless of his promise, conducted him to the council. The council also gave him a solemn promise of pardon if he would confess his guilt, and discover his accomplices. They were much disappointed to hear that only one man was privy to his purpose, who was since dead. Mitchell was then brought before a court of justice, and ordered to make a third confession, which he refused. He was imprisoned for several years, and then tried. His own confession was urged against him. It was in vain for him to plead the illegality of that evidence, and to appeal to the promise of pardon previously given. The council took an oath that they had given no such promise; and Mitchell was condemned. Lauderdale, who at that time governed Scotland, would have pardoned him, but the primate insisted on his execution; observing, that if assassins were permitted to go unpunished, his life must be continually in danger. Mitchell was accordingly executed.\n\nSharp had a servant, one Carmichael, who by his cruelty had rendered himself particularly odious to the zealots. Nine men formed the resolution of waylaying him in Magus-moor, about three miles from St Andrew's.\nWhile they were waiting for this man, the primate himself appeared with very few attendants. This they looked upon as a declaration of heaven in their favour; and calling out, \"The Lord has delivered him into our hands,\" they ran up to the carriage. They fired at him without effect; a circumstance which was afterwards imputed to magic. They then dispatched him with their swords, regardless of the tears and intreates of his daughter, who accompanied him (A).\n\nThus fell Archbishop Sharp, whose memory is even at present detested by the common people of Scotland. His abilities were certainly good, and in the early part of his life he appears with honour and dignity. But his conduct afterwards was too cruel and inflexible to merit approbation. His treatment of Mitchell was mean and vindictive. How far he contributed to the measures adopted against the presbyterians is not certain. They were equally cruel and impolitic; nor did their effects cease with the measures themselves. The unheard-of cruelties exercised by the ministers of Cha. II. against the adherents of the covenant, raised such a flame of enthusiasm and bigotry as is not yet entirely extinguished.\n\nSharp, Dr John, archbishop of York, was descended from the Sharps of Little Norton, a family of Bradford Dale in Yorkshire; and was son of an eminent tradesman of Bradford, where he was born in 1644. He was educated at Cambridge, and in 1667 entered into orders. That same year he became domestic chaplain to Sir Heneage Finch, then attorney-general. In 1672 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Berkshire. In 1675 he was installed a prebendary in the cathedral church of Norwich; and the year following was instituted into the rectory of St Bartholomew near the Royal Exchange, London. In 1681 he was, by the interest of his patron Sir Heneage Finch, then lord high chancellor of England, made dean of Norwich; but in 1686 was suspended for taking occasion, in some of his sermons, to vindicate the doctrine of the church of England in opposition to Popery. In 1688 he was sworn chaplain to King James II., being then probably restored after his suspension for it is certain that he was chaplain to King Charles II., and attended as a court chaplain at the coronation of King James II. In 1689 he was declared dean of Canterbury; but never could be persuaded to fill up any of the vacancies made by the deprived bishops. Upon the death of Dr Lamplugh, he was promoted to the see of York. In 1702 he preached the sermon at the coronation of Queen Anne; and the same year was sworn of the privy-council, and made lord almoner to her majesty. He died at Bath in 1713; and was interred in the cathedral of York, where a monument is erected to his memory.—His sermons, which were collected after his death and published in 7 vols. 8vo, are justly admired.\n\nSharp, Abraham, an eminent English mathematician, and astronomer, was born at Little Horton, near Bradford, in the year 1651. He was put apprentice to a merchant at Manchester; but so strongly was he inclined to the study of mathematics, that he soon found his situation both irksome and disagreeable. By the mutual consent, therefore, of his master and himself, he quitted the business of a merchant. He then removed to Liverpool, where he wholly devoted himself to mathematical studies, and where, for a subsistence, he taught writing and accounts.\n\nSoon after this a merchant from London, in whose house the celebrated Mr Flamsteed then lodged, engaged Mr Sharp to be his book-keeper. With this eminent astronomer he soon contracted an intimate friendship, and by his recommendation he obtained a more profitable employment in the dock-yard of Chatham, where he continued till his friend and patron called him to his assistance. Mr Sharp was chiefly employed in the construction of the mural arch, which he finished in the course of 14 months so entirely to the satisfaction of Mr Flamsteed, that he spoke of him in terms of the highest praise. In the opinion of Mr Smeaton, this was the first good instrument of the kind, and Mr Sharp the first artist who cut delicate divisions on astronomical instruments. When this instrument was constructed, Mr Sharp was but 25, and Mr Flamsteed 30 years of age. Mr Sharp assisted his friend in making a catalogue of nearly 3000 fixed stars, with their longitudes and magnitudes, their right ascensions and polar distances, with the variations of the same while they change their longitude by one degree.\n\nBut from the fatigue of constantly observing the stars by night, in a cold thin air, added to a weakly constitution, his health was much impaired; for the recovery of which he requested leave to retire to his house at Horton, where, as soon as he felt himself recovering, he began to fit up an observatory of his own, and the telescopes he made use of were all of his own construction, and the lenses ground and adjusted with his own hands.\n\nIt was about this time that he assisted Mr Flamsteed in calculating most of the tables in the second volume of his Historia Coelestis, as appears by their letters, to be seen in the hands of Mr Sharp's friends at Horton. The mathematician, says Dr Hutton, meets with something extraordinary in Sharp's elaborate treatise of Geometry Improved; by a large and accurate table of segments of circles, its construction and various uses in the solution of several difficult problems, with compendious tables for finding a true proportional part; and their use in these or any other tables exemplified in making logarithms.\n\n(A) Such is the account given by all our historians of the murder of Archbishop Sharp; and that he fell by the hands of fanatics, whom he persecuted, is certain. A tradition, however, has been preferred in different families descended from him, which may be mentioned, and is in itself certainly not incredible. The primate, it seems, who, when minister of Crail, was peculiarly severe in punishing the sin of fornication, had, in the plenitude of his archiepiscopal authority, taken notice of a criminal amour carried on between a nobleman high in office and a lady of some fashion who lived within his diocese. This interference was in that licentious age deemed very impertinent; and the archbishop's descendants believe that the proud peer infligated the deluded rabble to murder their ancestor.\nlogarithms, or their natural numbers, to 60 places of figures; there being a table of them for all primes to 1100, true to 6x figures. His concise treatise of Polydra, or solid bodies of many bases, both of the regular ones and others; to which are added, 12 new ones, with various methods of forming them, and their exact dimensions in furls or species, and in numbers; illustrated with a variety of copper-plates, neatly engraved by his own hands. Indeed, few of the mathematical instrument makers could exceed him in exactly graduating or neatly engraving mathematical or astronomical instruments. He possessed a remarkably clear head for contriving, and an extraordinary hand for executing anything, not only in mechanics, but likewise in drawing, writing, and making the most beautiful figures in all his calculations and constructions.\n\nThe quadrature of the circle was undertaken by him for his own amusement, in the year 1699, deduced from two different series, by which the truth of it was proved to 72 places of figures, as may be seen in Sherwin's Tables of Logarithms. In the same book may likewise be seen his ingenious improvements on the making of logarithms, and the constructing of the natural sines, tangents, and secants.\n\nMr Sharp kept up a correspondence with most of the eminent mathematicians and astronomers of his time, as Flamsteed, Newton, Halley, Wallis, Hodgson, &c., the answers to whose letters are all written on the backs or empty spaces of the letters he received, in shorthand of his own invention. Being one of the most accurate and indefatigable computers whoever existed; he was many years the common resource for Flamsteed, Sir Jonas Moor, Halley, and others, in all sorts of troublesome and delicate calculations.\n\nMr Sharp was never married, and spent his time as a hermit. He was of a middle stature, very thin, of a weakly constitution; but remarkably feeble during the last 3 or 4 years before his death, which happened on the 18th of July 1742, in the 91st year of his age.\n\nHe was very irregular as to his meals, and uncommonly sparing in his diet, which he frequently took in the following manner. A little square hole, resembling a window, formed a communication between the room where he usually studied, and another where a servant could enter; and before this hole he had contrived a sliding board. It often happened, that the breakfast, dinner, and supper, have remained untouched, when the servant has gone to remove what was left,—so deeply was he engaged in calculations.\n\nSHARP, in Music. See INTERVAL.\n\nSHASTAH, the same as SHASTER.\n\nSHASTER, SHASTAH, or BEDANG, the name of a sacred book, in high estimation among the idolaters of Hindoostan, containing all the dogmas of the religion of the bramins, and all the ceremonies of their worship; and serving as a commentary on the VEDAM.\n\nThe term Shaster denotes \"science\" or \"system\"; and is applied to other works of astronomy and philosophy, which have no relation to the religion of the Indians. None but the bramins and rajahs of India are allowed to read the Vedam; the priests of the Banians, called Shudurers, may read the Shaster; and the people, in general, are allowed to read only the Paran or Pouran, which is a commentary on the Shaster.\n\nThe Shaster is divided into three parts: the first containing the moral law of the Indians; the second, the rites and ceremonies of their religion; and the third, the distribution of the people into tribes or classes, with the duties pertaining to each class.\n\nThe principal precepts of morality, contained in the first part of the Shaster, are the following: that no animal be killed, because the Indians attribute souls to brute animals as well as to mankind; that they neither hear nor speak evil, nor drink wine, nor eat flesh, nor touch any thing that is unclean; that they observe the feasts, prayers, and washings, which their law prescribes; that they tell no lies, nor be guilty of deceit in trade; that they neither oppress nor offer violence to one another; that they celebrate the solemn feasts and fasts, and appropriate certain hours of ordinary sleep to cultivate a disposition for prayer; and that they do not steal or defraud one another.\n\nThe ceremonies, contained in the second part of the Shaster, are such as these: that they wash often in the rivers, thereby obtaining the pardon of their sins; that they mark their forehead with red, in token of their relation to the Deity; that they present offerings and prayers under certain trees, set apart for this purpose; that they pray in the temples, make oblations to their pagodas or idols, sing hymns, and make processions, &c.; that they make pilgrimages to distant rivers, and especially to the Ganges, there to wash themselves and make offerings; that they make vows to particular saints, according to their respective departments; that they render homage to the Deity at the first sight of the sun; that they pay their respect to the sun and moon, which are the two eyes of the Deity; and that they treat with particular veneration those animals that are deemed more pure than others; as the cow, buffalo, &c.; because the souls of men have transmigrated into these animals.\n\nThe third part of the Shaster records the distribution of the people into four classes: the first being that of the bramins or priests, appointed to instruct the people; the second, that of the kuttiris or nobles, who are the magistrates; the third, that of the shudderis or merchants; and the fourth, that of the mechanics. Each person is required to remain in the class in which he was born, and to pursue the occupation assigned to him by the Shaster. According to the bramins, the Shaster was imparted by God himself to Brahma, and by him to the bramins; who communicated the contents of it to the people.\n\nModern writers have given us very different accounts of the antiquity and importance of the Shaster. Mr Holwell, who had made considerable progress in the translation of this book, apprehends, that the mythology as well as the cosmogony of the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, was borrowed from the doctrines of the bramins, contained in it, even to the copying of their exteriors of worship, and the distribution of their idols, though grossly mutilated and adulterated. With respect to the Vedam and Shaster, or scriptures of the Gentooos, this writer informs us, that Vedam, in the Mala bar language, signifies the same as Shaster in the Sanscrit; and that the first book is followed by the Gentooos of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and also of the island of Ceylon. The Shaster is followed by the Gentooos of the provinces of Bengal, and by all the Gentooos.\nGentoos of the rest of India, commonly called India Proper, along the course of the rivers Ganges and Jumna to the Indus. Both these books (he says) contain the institutes of their respective religion and worship, as well as the history of their ancient rajahs and princes, often couched under allegory and fable. Their antiquity is contended for by the partisans of each; but he thinks, that the similitude of their names, idols, and great part of their worship, leaves little room to doubt, nay plainly evinces, that both these scriptures were originally one. He adds, if we compare the great purity and chaste manners of the Shaster with the great absurdities and impurities of the Vedam, we need not hesitate to pronounce the latter a corruption of the former.\n\nWith regard to the high original of these scriptures, the account of the bramins is as follows. Brahma (that is, \"Mighty Spirit\"), about 4866 years ago, assumed the form of man and the government of Indo-stan. He translated the divine law (designed for the restoration of mankind, who had offended in a pre-existent state, and who are now in their last scene of probation, to the dignity from which they were degraded) out of the language of angels into the well known Sanscrit language, and called his translation the Chartah Bhade Shoglah of Birmah, or the Six Scriptures of Divine IVords of the Mighty Spirit. He appointed the bramins, deriving their name from him, to preach the word of God; and the doctrines of the Shaster were accordingly preached in their original purity 1000 years. About this time there was published a paraphrase on the Chartah Bhade; and about 5000 years afterwards, a second exposition, called the Aughtorrah Bhade Shogla, or Eighteen Books of Divine IVords, written in a character compounded of the common Indo-stan and the Sanscrit. This innovation produced a schism among the Gentoos; on which occasion, it is said, those of Coromandel and Malabar formed a scripture of their own, which they pretended to be founded on the Chartah Bhade of Brahmin, and called it the Vedam of Birmah, or Divine Words of the Mighty Spirit. The original Chartah Bhade was thrown aside, and at length wholly unknown, except to a few families; who can still read and expound it in the Sanscrit character.\n\nWith the establishment of the Aughtorrah Bhade, and Vedam, which, according to the Gentoo account, is 3366 years ago, their polytheism commenced; and the principles of religion became so obscure, and their ceremonies so numerous, that every head of a family was obliged to keep a bramin as a guide both in faith and practice. Mr Holwell is of opinion, that the Chartah Bhade, or Original Scriptures, are not copied from any other system of theology, promulgated to or obtruded upon mankind. The Gentoos do not attribute them to Zoroaster; and Mr Holwell supposes, that both Zoroaster and Pythagoras visited Indo-stan, not to instruct, but to be instructed.\n\nFrom the account of Mr Dow, we learn, that the books which contain the religion and philosophy of the Hindoos are distinguished by the name of Bedas; that they are four in number, and like the sacred writings of other nations, said to be penned by the Divinity. Beda, he says, in the Sanscrit language, literally signifies science; and these books treat not only of religion and moral duties, but of every branch of philosophic knowledge. The bramins maintain, that the Bedas are the divine laws, which Brimha, at the creation of the world, delivered for the instruction of mankind; but they affirm, that their meaning was perverted in the first age by the ignorance and wickedness of some princes, whom they represent as evil spirits, who then haunted the earth.\n\nThe first credible account we have of the Bedas is, that about the commencement of the Cal Jug, of which era the year 1768 was the 4886th year, they were written, or rather collected, by a great philosopher and reputed prophet, called Bealis Muni, or Bealis the Inspired.\n\nThe Hindoos (says Mr Dow) are divided into two great religious sects: the followers of the doctrine of Bedang, which is the original Shaster, or commentary upon the Bedas; and those who adhere to the principles of the Neadiren. The original Shaster is called Bedang, and is a commentary upon the Bedas. This book, he says, is erroneously called in Europe the Vedam. It is ascribed to Bealis Muni, and is said to have been revised some years after by one Serider Swami, since which it has been reckoned sacred, and not subject to any farther alterations.\n\nAlmost all the Hindoos of the Decan, and those of the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, are of this sect. The followers of the Bedang Shaster do not allow that any physical evil exists; they maintain that God created all things perfectly good; but that man, being a free agent, may be guilty of moral evil, which may be injurious to himself, but can be of no detriment to the general system of nature. God, they say, being perfectly benevolent, never punished the wicked otherwise than by the pain and affliction which are the natural consequences of evil actions; and hell, therefore, is no other than a consciousness of evil.\n\nThe Neadiren Shaster is said to have been written by a philosopher called Gouiam, near four thousand years ago. The bramins, from Mr Dow's account of their sacred books, appear to believe invariably in the unity, eternity, omnipotence, and omnipresence of God; and the polytheism of which they have been accused is no more than a symbolical worship of the divine attributes, which they divide into three classes. Under the name of Brimha, they worship the wisdom and creative power of God; under the appellation of Bishen, his providential and preserving quality; and under that of Shibah, that attribute which tends to destroy.\n\nAs few of our readers may have an opportunity of perusing the Shaster, we shall, by way of specimen, join a passage from it, which, though it contains some metaphysical mysteries concerning the creation, yet discovers views of God to enlightened that they would not disgrace more refined nations. The passage which we shall quote is the first chapter of the Shaster, which is a dialogue between Brimha the Wisdom of the Divinity, and Narud or Benben, who is represented as the son of Brimha. Narud desires to be instructed by his father; and for that purpose puts the following questions to him:\n\n\"Narud. O father! thou first of God, thou art said to have created the world, and thy son Narud, astonished at what he beholds, is desirous to be instructed how all these things were made.\n\n\"Brimha. Be not deceived, my son! do not imagine that\nthat I was the creator of the world, independent of the Divine Mover, who is the great original essence and creator of all things. Look, therefore, only upon me as the instrument of the great will, and a part of his being, whom he called forth to execute his eternal designs.\n\n\"Narud. What shall we think of God?\"\n\n\"Brimha. Being immaterial, he is above all conception; being invisible, he can have no form; but, from what we behold in his works, we may conclude that he is eternal, omnipotent, knowing all things, and present everywhere.\"\n\n\"Narud. How did God create the world?\"\n\n\"Brimha. Affection dwelt with God from all eternity. It was of three different kinds; the creative, the preserving, and the destructive. This first is represented by Brimha, the second by Biften, and the third by Shibah. You, O Narud! are taught to worship all the three in various shapes and likenesses, as the Creator, the Preserver, and the Destroyer. The affection of God then produced power, and power, at a proper conjunction of time and fate, embraced goodness, and produced matter. The three qualities then acting upon matter, produced the universe in the following manner: From the opposite actions of the creative and destructive quality in matter, self-motion first arose. Self-motion was of three kinds; the first inclining to pliability, the second to discord, and the third to rest. The discordant actions then produced the Akath (a kind of celestial element), which invisible element possessed the quality of conveying sound; it produced air, a palpable element; fire, a visible element; water, a fluid element; and earth, a solid element.\n\n\"The Akath dispersed itself abroad. Air formed the atmosphere; fire, collecting itself, blazed forth in the holst of heaven; water rose to the surface of the earth, being forced from beneath by the gravity of the latter element. Thus broke forth the world from the veil of darkness, in which it was formerly comprehended by God. Order rose over the universe. The seven heavens were formed, and the seven worlds were fixed in their places; there to remain till the great dissolution, when all things shall be absorbed into God.\n\n\"God seeing the earth in full bloom, and that vegetation was strong from its seeds, called forth for the first time intellect, which he endued with various organs and shapes, to form a diversity of animals upon the earth. He endued the animals with five senses; feeling, seeing, smelling, tasting, and hearing; but to man he gave reflection, to raise him above the beasts of the field.\n\n\"The creatures were created male and female, that they might propagate their species upon the earth. Every herb bore the seed of its kind, that the world might be clothed with verdure, and all animals provided with food.\n\n\"Narud. What dost thou mean, O father! by Intellect?\"\n\n\"Brimha. It is a portion of the great soul of the universe breathed into all creatures, to animate them for a certain time.\n\n\"Narud. What becomes of it after death?\"\n\n\"Brimha. It animates other bodies, or returns, like a drop, into that unbounded ocean from which it first arose.\n\n\"Narud. Shall not then the souls of good men receive rewards? nor the souls of the bad meet with punishment?\"\n\n\"Brimha. The souls of men are distinguished from those of other animals; for the first are endowed with reason, and with consciousness of right and wrong. If therefore man shall adhere to the first, as far as his powers shall extend, his soul, when disengaged from the body by death, shall be absorbed into the divine essence, and shall never more reanimate flesh: But the souls of those who do evil are not, at death, disengaged from all the elements. They are immediately clothed with a body of fire, air, and akath, in which they are for a time punished in hell. After the season of their grief is over, they reanimate other bodies; but till they shall arrive at a state of purity they can never be absorbed into God.\n\n\"Narud. What is the nature of that absorbed state which the souls of good men enjoy after death?\"\n\n\"Brimha. It is a participation of the divine nature, where all passions are utterly unknown, and where consciousness is lost in bliss.\n\n\"Narud. Thou sayest, O father, that unless the soul is perfectly pure it cannot be absorbed into God; now, as the actions of the generality of men are partly good and partly bad, whither are their spirits sent immediately after death?\"\n\n\"Brimha. They must atone for their crimes in hell, where they must remain for a space proportioned to the degree of their iniquities; then they rise to heaven to be rewarded for a time for their virtues; and from thence they will return to the world to reanimate other bodies.\n\n\"Narud. What is time?\"\n\n\"Brimha. Time existed from all eternity with God; but it can only be estimated since motion was produced, and only be conceived by the mind, from its own constant progress.\n\n\"Narud. How long shall this world remain?\"\n\n\"Brimha. Until the four jugs shall have revolved. Then Rudder (the same with Shibah, the destroying quality of God), with the ten spirits of dissolution, shall roll a comet under the moon, that shall involve all things in fire, and reduce the world into ashes. God shall then exist alone, for matter will be totally annihilated.\"\n\nThose who desire more information on this subject may consult Dow's History of India, and Holwell's Interesting Historical Events.\n\nSHAW, Dr Thomas, known to the learned world by his travels to Barbary and the Levant, was born at Kendal in Westmoreland about the year 1692. He was appointed chaplain to the English consul at Algiers, in which station he continued for several years; and from thence took proper opportunities of travelling into different parts. He returned in 1733; was elected fellow of the Royal Society; and published the account of his travels at Oxford, folio, 1738. In 1740 he was nominated principal of St Edmond-hall, which he raised from a ruinous state by his munificence; and was regius professor of Greek at Oxford until his death, which happened in 1751. Dr Clayton, bishop of Clogher, having attacked these Travels in his Description of the East, Dr Shaw published a supplement by way of vindication,\nSHEAWLS, are woollen handkerchiefs, an ell wide, and near two long.

It is the produce of a Tibet sheep; but some say that no wool is employed but that of lambs torn from the belly of their mother before the time of birth. The most beautiful shawls come from Cashmere; their price is from 150 livres (about six guineas) to 1200 livres (or 30l. sterling).\n\nIn the Transactions of the Society for Encouraging Arts, Manufactures, &c. for the year 1792, we are informed that a shawl counterpane, four yards square, manufactured by Mr. P. J. Knights of Norwich, was presented to the society; and that, upon examination, it appeared to be of greater breadth than any goods of equal fineness and texture that had ever before been presented to the society, or to their knowledge woven in this country. The shawls of Mr. Knight's manufacture, it is said, can scarcely be distinguished from Indian shawls, though they can be afforded at one-twentieth part of the price. When the shawl is 16 quarters square, Mr. Knights says it may be retailed at 20l.; if it consisted of 12 quarters, and embroidered as the former, it will cost 15l.; if plain, with a fringe only, a shawl of 16 quarters square may be sold at 8l. 8s.; if 12 quarters and fringed, at 6l. 6s.\n\nMr. Knights maintains, that his counterpane of four yards square is equal in beauty, and superior in strength, to the Indian counterpanes, which are sold at 200 guineas. The principal consumption of this cloth is in train-dresses for ladies; as likewise for long scarfs, in imitation of the real Indian scarfs, which are sold from 60l. to 80l.; whereas scarfs of this fabric are sold for as many shillings, and the ladies' square shawls in proportion.\n\nSHEADING, a riding, tything, or division, in the isle of Man; the whole island being divided into five sheadings; in every one of which is a coroner or chief constable, appointed by the delivery of a rod at the annual convention.\n\nSHEARBILL, the Rhynchos Nigra of Linnæus, the Black Skimmer of Pennant and Latham, and Cutwater of Catesby. See ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nSHEATHING, in the sea-language, is the cafting that part of a ship which is to be under water with fir-board of an inch thick; first laying hair and tar mixed together under the boards, and then nailing them on, in order to prevent worms from eating the ship's bottom.—Ships of war are now generally sheathed with copper: but copper sheathing is liable to be corroded by the action of salt water, and something is still wanting to effect this purpose. It is very probable that tar might answer very well.\n\nIn the Cornish mines, copper or brass pumps are often placed in the deepest parts, and are consequently exposed to the vitriolic or other mineral waters with which sheathing some of these mines abound, and which are known to have a much stronger effect on copper than sea water. These pumps are generally about six feet long, and are screwed together, and made tight by the interposition of a ring of lead, and the joints are afterwards tarred. One of these pumps was so much corroded as to render it unfit for use; but the spots of tar, which by accident had dropped on it, preserved the parts they covered from the action of the water. These projected in some places more than a quarter of an inch; and the joints were so far defended by the thin coat of tar, that it was as perfect as when it came from the hands of the manufacturer. If tar thus effectually defends copper from these acid waters, can there remain a doubt of its preserving it from the much milder waters of the sea?\n\nSHEATS, in a ship, are ropes bent to the clews of the sails, serving in the lower sails to haul aft the clews of the sail; but in topsails they serve to haul home the clew of the sail close to the yard-arm.\n\nSHEAVE, in Mechanics, a solid cylindrical wheel, fixed in a channel, and moveable about an axis, as being used to raise or increase the mechanical powers applied to remove any body.\n\nSHEBBEAR, JOHN, a political writer, was born at Bideford in Devonshire, in the year 1729. He received the rudiments of his education at the free grammar school of Exeter. It has been often observed, that the future life of a man may be gathered from his puerile character; and accordingly Shebbeare, while a boy at school, gave the strongest indications of his future eminence in philanthropy and learning, by the extraordinary tenaciousness of his memory and the readiness of his wit, as well as the malignity of his disposition; being universally regarded as a young man of surprising genius, while at the same time he was despised for his malicious temper.\n\nAbout the age of 16, Shebbeare was bound apprentice to an eminent surgeon in his native town, under whom he acquired a considerable share of medical knowledge. His talent for lampoon appeared at this early period, and he could not forbear from exercising it on his master; but the chief marks for the arrows of his wit were the gentlemen of the corporation, some of whom laughed at such trifles, while such as were irritable often commenced prosecutions against him, but without success. He was frequently summoned to appear at the sessions, for daring to speak and write disrespectfully of the magistrates; but the laugh was always on the side of Shebbeare.\n\nWhen his time was out, he set up for himself, then discovering a taste for chemistry; soon after which he married an amiable young woman with no fortune, but of respectable connections. Failing in business at Bideford, he went to Bristol in 1736, entering into partnership with a chemist, and never afterwards visited his native town.\n\nThe attention of the public was, in the year 1739, attracted by an epitaph to the memory of Thomas Foster, Esq. M. P. for Bristol, in which he contrived to raise emotions of pity, grief, and indignation. In the following year he published a pamphlet on the Bristol waters, after which we know little or nothing respecting him for a number of years. He was at Paris in 1752, where he obtained, it is said, the degree of doctor in medicine,\nShebbeare, a fact, however, which many are disposed to question.\n\nAbout this time he began to emerge from obscurity, and draw the attention of the public, by pamphlets written with such virulence and celerity as it would be difficult to equal in the most intemperate times. In 1754 he commenced his career with a work denominated the Marriage Act, a political novel, in which he treated the legislature with such freedom that he was apprehended, but soon after set at liberty.\n\nThe most celebrated performances, however, were a series of letters to the People of England, written in a vigorous and energetic style, well calculated to make an impression on common readers; and they were of course read with avidity, and diligently circulated. They galled the ministry, who at first were too eager to punish the author. When the third letter was published, warrants were issued by Lord Holdernesse in March 1756, to take up both the publisher and the author; a prosecution which appears to have been dropt. On the 12th of January 1758, the same nobleman signed a general warrant for apprehending the author, printer, and publishers of a wicked, audacious, and treasonable libel, entitled, \"A fifth letter to the people of England, on the progress of national ruin, in which is shewn that the present grandeur of France and calamities of this nation are owing to the influence of Hanover on the councils of England;\" and then having found, to seize and apprehend, together with their books and papers.\n\nGovernment having received information that a seventh letter was in the press, all the copies were seized and suppressed by virtue of another warrant, dated January 23. In Easter term an information was filed against him by the attorney-general, and on the 17th of June the information was tried, when Shebbeare was found guilty; and on the 28th of November he received sentence, by which he was fined £1, ordered to stand in the pillory December 5, at Charing Cross, to be confined three years, and to give security for his good behaviour for seven years, himself in £50l. and two others in £50l. each. During his confinement, he declared he never received as presents more than 20 guineas from all the world.\n\nHe was detained in prison during the whole time of the sentence, and with some degree of rigour; for when his life was in danger from a bad state of health, and he applied to the court of king's-bench for permission to be carried into the rules a few hours in a day; though Lord Mansfield acceded to the petition, the prayer of it was denied and defeated by Judge Foster. At the termination of the time of his sentence, a new reign commenced; and shortly afterwards, during Mr Grenville's administration, a pension of £50l. a-year was granted him by the crown, through the influence of Sir John Philips; and he ever after became devoted to the service of government. He was of course abused in almost every periodical work, which he seems in general to have had the good sense to neglect. Dr Smollet introduced him, in no very respectful light, under the name of Ferret, in Sir Launcelot Greaves; and Mr Hogarth made him one of the group in the third election print.\n\nDuring the latter part of his life he seems to have written but little. He strenuously supported the ministry during the American war, having published, in 1775, an answer to the printed speech of Edmund Burke, Esq. spoken in the house of commons, April 19, 1774, wherein he investigates his knowledge of policy, legislature, human kind, history, commerce, and finance; his arguments are examined; the conduct of administration is boldly defended, and his talents as an orator clearly exposed to view. An essay on the origin, progress, and establishment of National Society; in which the principles of government, the definition of physical, moral, civil, and religious liberty contained in Dr Price's observations, &c. are examined and controverted; together with a justification of the legislature in reducing America to obedience by force.\n\nHis publications of a satirical, political, and medical nature, amount to 34, besides a novel called Filial Piety, in which hypocrisy and blustering courage are very properly chastised. He died on the 1st of August 1788, leaving behind him the character of a benevolent man among those who were best acquainted with him; a character which, from the manner he speaks of his connections, he probably deserved.\n\nSHEEP, in Zoology. See Ovis and Wool.\n\nAmongst the various animals with which Divine Pro-Show evidence has flooded the world for the use of man, none is a wonder to be found more innocent, more useful, or more valuable, than the sheep. The sheep supplies us with food and clothing, and finds ample employment for our poor at all times and seasons of the year, whereby a variety of manufactures of woollen cloth is carried on without interruption to domestic comfort and loss to friendly society or injury to health, as is the case with many other occupations. Every lock of wool that grows on its back becomes the means of support to flappers, dyers, pickers, scourers, scrollers, carders, combers, spinners, spoolers, warpers, queueers, weavers, fullers, tuckers, burlers, shearers, prickers, clothers, and packers, who, one after another, tumble and toss, and twist, and bake, and boil, this raw material, till they have each extracted a livelihood out of it; and then comes the merchant, who, in his turn, ships it (in its highest state of improvement) to all quarters of the globe, from whence he brings back every kind of riches to his country, in return for this valuable commodity which the sheep affords.\n\nBesides this, the useful animal, after being deprived of his coat, produces another against the next year; and when we are hungry, and kill him for food, he gives us his skin to employ the fell-mongers and parchment-makers, who supply us with a durable material for securing our estates, rights, and possessions; and if our enemies take the field against us, supplies us with a powerful instrument for rousing our courage to repel their attacks. When the parchment-maker has taken as much of the skin as he can use, the glue-maker comes after and picks up every morsel that is left, and therewith supplies a material for the carpenter and cabinet-maker, which they cannot do without, and which is essentially necessary before we can have elegant furniture in our houses; tables, chairs, looking-glasses, and a hundred other articles of convenience; and when the winter nights come on, while we are deprived of the cheering light of the sun, the sheep supplies us with an artificial mode of light, whereby we preserve every pleasure of domestic society, and with whose assistance we can continue our work, or write or read, and improve our...\nSheep.\n\nour minds, or enjoy the social mirth of our tables. Another part of the slaughtered animal supplies us with an ingredient necessary for making good common soap, a useful store for producing cleanliness in every family, rich or poor. Neither need the horns be thrown away; for they are converted by the button-makers and turners into a cheap kind of buttons, tips for bows, and many useful ornaments. From the very trotters an oil is extracted useful for many purposes, and they afford good food when baked in an oven.\n\nEven the bones are useful also; for by a late invention of Dr Higgins, they are found, when reduced to ashes, to be an useful and essential ingredient in the composition of the finest artificial stone in ornamental work for chimney-pieces, cornices of rooms, houses, &c., which renders the composition more durable by effectually preventing its cracking (a).\n\nIf it is objected to the meek inoffensive creature, that he is expensive while living, in eating up our grass, &c., it may be answered that it is quite the contrary; for he can feed where every other animal has been before him and grazed all they could find; and that if he takes a little grass on our downs or in our fields, he amply repays us for every blade of grass in the richness of the manure which he leaves behind him. He protects the hands from the cold wintry blast, by providing them with the softest leather gloves. Every gentleman's library is also indebted to him for the neat binding of his books, for the sheath of his sword, and for cases for his instruments; in short, not to be tedious in mentioning the various uses of leather, there is hardly any furniture or utensil of life but the sheep contributes to render either more useful, convenient, or ornamental.\n\nAs the sheep is so valuable an animal, every piece of information concerning the proper method of managing it must be of importance. It will not therefore be useless or unentertaining to give some account of the manner of managing sheep in Spain, a country famous for producing the best wool in the world.\n\nIn Spain there are two kinds of sheep: the coarse-woollen sheep, which always remain in their native country, and are housed every night in winter; and the fine-woollen sheep, which are always in the open air, and travel every summer from the cool mountains of the northern parts of Spain, to feed in winter on the southern warm plains of Andalusia, Mancha, and Estremadura. Of these latter, it appears from accurate computations, that there are about five millions (b); and that the wool and flesh of a flock of 10,000 sheep produced yearly about 2,100 reals a-head, about the value of 12 English sixpences, one of which belongs to the owner, three to the king, and the other eight are allowed for the expenses of pasture, tythes, shepherds, dogs, salt, feeding, &c. Ten thousand sheep form a flock, which is divided into ten tribes, under the management of one person, who has absolute dominion over fifty shepherds and fifty dogs.\n\nM. Bourgoanne, a French gentleman, who resided at Segovia, many years in Spain, and directed his inquiries chiefly to the civil government, trade, and manufactures, of that country, gives the following account of the wandering sheep of Segovia. \"It is (says he) in the neighboring mountains that a part of the wandering sheep anne's Trans-feeding during the fine season. They leave them in the valley, vol. i. month of October, pass over those which separate the two Cattles, cross New Castile, and disperse themselves in the plains of Extremadura and Andalusia. For some years past those of the two Cattles, which are within reach of the Sierra-Morena, go thither to pass the winter; which, in that part of Spain, is more mild; the length of their day's journey is in proportion to the pasture they meet with. They travel in flocks from 1000 to 1200 in number, under the conduct of two shepherds; one of whom is called the Mayoral, the other the Zogal. When arrived at the place of their destination, they are distributed in the pastures previously assigned them. They return in the month of April; and whether it be habit or natural instinct that draws them towards the climate, which at this season becomes most proper for them, the inquietude which they manifest might, in case of need, serve as an almanac to their conductors.\"\n\nMr Arthur Young, in that patriotic work which he conducted with great industry and judgement, the Annals of Agriculture, gives us a very accurate and interesting account of the Pyrenean or Catalonian sheep.\n\n\"On the northern ridge, bearing to the west, are the Olot pastures of the Spanish flocks. This ridge is not, however, the whole; there are two other mountains, quite out of a different situation, and the sheep travel from one to another as the pasture is short or plentiful. I examined the soil of these mountain pastures, and found it in general flaky; what in the west of England would be\n\n(a) Any curious person would be much entertained to see the manufacture of bone-ash, now (about 1794) carried on by Mr Minth of White-chapel, New Road, wherein the bones of sheep and cows undergo many ingenious processes. 1. There is a mill to break them; 2. A cauldron to extract their oil, marrow, and fat; 3. A reverberatory to heat them red hot; 4. An oven for those bones to moulder into ashes; 5. A flint to collect the fumes of the burnt bones into a brown fluid, from whence hartshorn is made; 6. Furnaces for making parts thereof into Glauber's salts; 7. A sand bath containing twelve jars, for collecting a crystallizing vapour into sal-ammoniac.\n\n(b) In the 16th century the travelling sheep were estimated at seven millions; under Phillip III. the number was diminished to two millions and a half. Uitariz, who wrote at the beginning of the 18th century, made it amount to four millions. The general opinion is, that at present it does not exceed five millions. If to this number the eight millions of stationary sheep be added, it will make nearly thirteen millions of animals, all managed contrary to the true interests of Spain, for the advantage of a few individuals. For the proprietors of stationary flocks also have privileges which greatly resemble those of the members of the Mesta. According to Arriaguebar, Spain contains eight millions of fine-woollen sheep, ten millions of coarse-woollen, and five hundred thousand bulls, oxen, and cows.\nbe called a stone brae, with some mixture of loam, and in a few places a little peaty. The plants are many of them untouched by the sheep; many ferns, narcissus, violets, &c., but burnet (Potentilla fragiflora) and the narrow-leaved plantain (Plantago lanceolata) were eaten, as may be supposed, cloe. I looked for trefoils, but found scarcely any; it was very apparent that soil and peculiarity of herbage had little to do in rendering these heights proper for sheep. In the northern parts of Europe, the tops of mountains half the height of these (for we were above snow in July) are bogs, all are so which I have seen in our islands, or at least the proportion of dry land is very trifling to that which is extremely wet: Here they are in general very dry. Now a great range of dry land, let the plants be what they may, will in every country suit sheep. The flock is brought every night to one spot, which is situated at the end of the valley on the river I have mentioned, and near the port or passage of Picada: it is a level spot sheltered from all winds. The soil is eight or nine inches deep of old dung, not at all inclosed: from the freedom from wood all around, it seems to be chosen partly for safety against wolves and bears. Near it is a very large stone, or rather rock, fallen from the mountain. This the shepherds have taken for a shelter, and have built a hut against it; their beds are sheep skins, and their door so small that they crawl in. I saw no place for fire; but they have it, since they dress here the flesh of their sheep, and in the night sometimes keep off the bears, by whirling fire-brands: four of them belonging to the flock mentioned above lie here. I viewed their flock very carefully, and by means of our guide and interpreter, made some inquiries of the shepherds, which they answered readily, and very civilly. A Spaniard at Venafaque, a city in the Pyrenees, gives 600 livres French (the livre is 10½d. English) a-year for the pasturage of this flock of 2000 sheep. In the winter he feeds them into the lower parts of Catalonia, a journey of 12 or 13 days, and when the snow is melted in the spring, they are conducted back again. They are the whole year kept in motion, and moving from spot to spot, which is owing to the great range they everywhere have of pasture. They are always in the open air, never housed or under cover, and never take of any food but what they can find on the hills.\n\n\"Four shepherds, and from four to six large Spanish dogs, have the care of this flock: the latter are in France called the Pyrenees breed; they are black and white, of the size of a large wolf, a large head and neck, armed with collars studded with iron spikes. No wolf can stand against them; but bears are more potent adversaries: if a bear can reach a tree, he is safe; he rises on his hind legs, with his back to the tree, and sets the dogs at defiance. In the night the shepherds rely entirely on their dogs; but on hearing them bark are ready with fire-arms, as the dogs rarely bark if a bear is not at hand. I was surprised to find that they are fed only with bread and milk. The head shepherd is paid 120 livres a-year wages and bread; the others 80 livres and bread. But they are allowed to keep goats, of which they have many which they milk every day. Their food is milk and bread, except the flesh of such sheep or lambs as accidents give them. The head shepherd keeps on the mountain top, or an elevated spot, from whence he can the better see around while the flock traverses the declivities. In doing this the sheep are exposed to great danger in places that are stony; for by walking among the rocks, and especially the goats, they move the stones, which, rolling down the hills, acquire an accelerated force enough to knock a man down, and sheep are often killed by them; yet we saw how alert they were to avoid such stones, and cautiously on their guard against them. I examined the sheep attentively. They are in general polled, but some have horns; which in the rams turn backwards behind the ears and project half a circle forward; the ewes' horns turn also behind the ears, but do not project; the legs white or reddish; speckled faces, some white, some reddish; they would weigh fat, I reckon, on an average, from 15 lb. to 18 lb. a quarter. Some tails short, some left long. A few black sheep among them: some with a very little tuft of wool on their foreheads. On the whole they resemble those on the South Downs; their legs are as short as those of that breed; a point which merits observation, as they travel so much and so well. Their shape is very good, round ribs and flat straight backs; and would with us be reckoned handsome sheep; all in good order and flesh. In order to be still better acquainted with them, I desired one of the shepherds to catch a ram for me to feel, and examine the wool, which I found very thick and good of the carding sort, as may be supposed. I took a specimen of it, and also of a hogget, or lamb of last year. In regard to the mellow softness under the skin, which, in Mr Bakewell's opinion, is a strong indication of a good breed, with a disposition to fatten, he had it in a much superior degree to many of our English breeds, to the full as much so as the South Downs, which are for that point the best short-woollen sheep which I know in England. The fleece was on his back, and weighed, as I guessed, about 8 lb. English; but the average, they say, of the flock is from four to five, as I calculated by reducing the Catalonian pound of 12 oz. to ours of 16, and is all sold to the French at 30s. the lb. French. This ram had the wool of the back part of his neck tied close, and the upper tuft tied a second knot by way of ornament; nor do they ever shear this part of the fleece for that reason: we saw several in the flock with this species of decoration. They said that this ram would sell in Catalonia for 20 livres. A circumstance which cannot be too much commended, and deserves universal imitation, is the extreme docility they accustom them to. When I desired the shepherd to catch one of his rams, I supposed he would do it with his crook, or probably not be able to do it at all; but he walked into the flock, and fingling out a ram and a goat, bid them follow him, which they did immediately; and he talked to them while they were obeying him, holding out his hand as if to give them something. By this method he brought me the ram, which I caught, and held without difficulty.\"\n\nThe best sort of sheep for fine wool are those bred What sheep in Herefordshire, Devonshire, and Worcestershire; but produce the they are small, and black-faced, and bear a small best wool. quantity. Warwick, Leicestershire, Buckingham, and Northamptonshire, breed a large-boned sheep, of the best shape and deepest wool we have. The marshes of Lincolnshire breed a very large kind of sheep, but their wool is not good, unless the breed be mended by bringing in sheep of other counties among them, which is a scheme of late very profitably followed there. In this...\nSheep. this county, it is no uncommon thing to give fifty guineas for a ram, and a guinea for the admittance of an ewe to one of these valuable males, or twenty guineas for the use of it for a certain number of ewes during one season. Suffolk also breeds a very valuable kind of sheep. The northern counties in general breed sheep with long but hairy wool; however, the wool which is taken from the neck and shoulders of the Yorkshire sheep is used for mixing with Spanish wool in some of their finest cloths.\n\nWales bears a small hardy kind of sheep, which has the best tasted flesh, but the worst wool of all. Nevertheless it is of more extensive use than the finest Segovian fleeces; for the benefit of the flannel manufacture is universally known. The sheep of Ireland vary like those of Great Britain; those of the south and east being large and their flesh rank; those of the north and the mountainous parts small and their flesh sweet. The fleeces in the same manner differ in degrees of value. Scotland breeds a small kind, and their fleeces are coarse.\n\nBut the new Leicestershire breed is the most fashionable, and of course the most profitable breed in the island. Joseph Altom of Clifton, who raised himself from a plough-boy, was the first who distinguished himself in the midland counties of England for a superior breed of sheep. How he improved his breed is not known; but it was customary for eminent farmers in his time to go to Clifton in summer to choose and purchase ram lambs, for which they paid two or three guineas. This man was succeeded by Mr Bakewell; and it may reasonably be supposed that the breed, by means of Altom's stock, had passed the first stage of improvement before Mr Bakewell's time. Still, however, it must be acknowledged, that the Leicestershire breed of sheep owes its present high state of improvement to the ability and care of Mr Bakewell.\n\n\"The manner in which Mr Bakewell raised his sheep to the degree of celebrity in which they deservedly stand, is notwithstanding the recency of the improvement, and its being done in the day of thousands now living, a thing in dispute; even among men high in the profession, and living in the very district in which the improvement has been carried on!\n\n\"Some are of opinion that he effected it by a cross with the Wiltshire breed; an improbable idea, as their form altogether contradicts it; others, that the Ryeland breed were used for this purpose; and with some show of probability. If any cross whatever was used the Ryeland breed, whether we view the form, the size, the wool, the flesh, or the fatting quality, is the most probable instrument of improvement.\n\n\"These ideas, however, are registered merely as matters of opinion. It is more than probable that Mr Bakewell alone is in possession of the several minutes of improvement; and the public can only hope that at a proper time the facts may be communicated for the direction of future improvers.\n\n\"Whenever this shall take place, it will most probably come out that no cross with any alien breed whatever has been used; but that the improvement has been effected by selecting individuals from kindred breeds; from the several breeds or varieties of long-wooled sheep, with which Mr Bakewell was surrounded on almost every side, and by breeding, inandin (c), with this selection: solicitously seizing the superior accidental varieties produced; associating these varieties; and still continuing to select, with judgement, the superior individuals.\n\n\"It now remains to give a description of the superior description clasps of individuals of this breed, especially ewes and wedders, in full condition, but not immoderately fat. The rams will require to be distinguished afterwards.\n\n\"The head is long, small, and hornless, with ears somewhat long, and standing backward, and with the nose shooting forward. The neck thin, and clean toward the head; but taking a conical form; standing low, and enlarging every way at the base; the fore-end altogether short. The bottom broad, with the shoulders, ribs, and chine extraordinary full. The loin broad, and the back level. The haunches comparatively full toward the hips, but light downward; being altogether small in proportion to the fore-parts. The legs, at present, of a moderate length; with the bone extremely fine. The bone throughout remarkably light. The carcass, when fully fat, takes a remarkable form; much wider than it is deep, and almost as broad as it is long. Full on the shoulder, widest on the ribs, narrowing with a regular curve towards the tail; approaching the form of the turtle nearer perhaps than any other animal. The pelt is thin, and the tail small. The wool is shorter than long wools in general, but much longer than the middle wools; the ordinary length of staple five to seven inches, varying much in fineness and weight.\"\n\nThis breed surpasses every other in beauty of form; they are full and weighty in the fore quarters; and are remarkably remarkable for smallness of bone. Mr Marshall, who well has been of so much benefit to agriculture and his country by his publications, informs us, in his Rural Economy of the Midland Counties, that he has seen a rib of a sheep of this breed contrasted with one of a Norfolk sheep: the disparity was striking; the latter nearly twice the size; while the meat which covered the former was three times the thickness; consequently the proportion of meat to bone was in the one incomparably greater than in the other. Therefore, in this point of view, the improved breed has a decided preference: for surely while mankind continue to eat flesh and throw away bone, the former must be, to the consumer at least, the more valuable.\n\nThe criterions of good and bad flesh while the animal is alive differ in different species, and are not properly settled in the same species. One superior breeder is of opinion, that if the flesh is not loose, it is of course good; holding, that the flesh of sheep is never found in a state of hardness, like that of ill-fed cattle: while others make a fourfold distinction of the flesh of sheep; as loofenets, mellownets, firmnets, hardnets: considering the first and the last equally exceptionable, and the second and third equally desirable; a happy mixture of the two being deemed the point of perfection.\n\n(c) Inandin is a term used in the midland counties of England to express breeding from the same family.\nThe Section of a First Rate Ship of War Shewing its various Timbers and Apartments.\n\nPlate CCCCLXXVI.\nThe flesh of sheep, when slaughtered, is well known to be of various qualities. Some is composed of large coarse grains, interspersed with wide empty pores like a sponge; others, of large grains, with wide pores filled with fat; others, of fine close grains, with smaller pores filled with fat; and a fourth, of close grains, without any intermixture of fatness.\n\nThe flesh of sheep, when dressed, is equally well known to possess a variety of qualities: some mutton is coarse, dry, and infipid; a dry sponge, affording little or no gravy of any colour. Another sort is somewhat firmer, imparting a light-coloured gravy only. A third plump, short, and palatable; affording a mixture of white and red gravy. A fourth likewise plump and well-flavoured, but discharging red gravy, and this in various quantities.\n\nIt is likewise observable, that some mutton, when dressed, appears covered with a thick, tough, parchment-like integument; others with a membrane comparatively fine and flexible. But these, and some of the other qualities of mutton, may not be wholly owing to breed, but in part to the age and the state of fatness at the time of slaughter. Examined in this light, whether we consider the degree of fatness, or their natural propensity to a state of fatness, even at an early age, the improved breed of Leicestershire sheep appears with many superior advantages.\n\nThe degree of fatness to which the individuals of this breed are capable of being raised, will perhaps appear incredible to those who have not had an opportunity of being convinced by their own observation. \"I have seen wedders (says Mr Marshall) of only two shear (two or three years old) so loaded with fat as to be scarcely able to make a run; and whose fat lay so much without the bone, it seemed ready to be shaken from the ribs on the smallest agitation.\n\n\"It is common for the sheep of this breed to have such a projection of fat upon the ribs, immediately behind the shoulder, that it may be easily gathered up in the hand, as the flank of a fat bullock. Hence it has gained, in technical language, the name of the fore-flank; a point which a modern breeder never fails to touch in judging of the quality of this breed of sheep.\n\n\"What is, perhaps, still more extraordinary, it is not rare for the rams, at least of this breed, to be 'cracked on the back;' that is, to be cloven along the top of the chine, in the manner fat sheep generally are upon the rump. This mark is considered as an evidence of the best blood.\n\n\"Extraordinary, however, as are these appearances while the animals are living, the facts are still more striking after they are slaughtered. At Litchfield, in February 1785, I saw a fore quarter of mutton, fattened by Mr Princep of Croxall, and which measured upon the ribs four inches of fat. It must be acknowledged, however, that the Leicestershire breed do not produce so much wool as most other long-woolled sheep.\"\n\nAs the practice of letting rams by the season is now become profitable, it may be useful to mention the method of rearing them.\n\n\"The principal ram-breeders save annually twenty, thirty, or perhaps forty ram lambs; castration being seldom applied, in the first instance, to the produce of a valuable ram, for in the choice of these lambs they are led more by blood or parentage, than by form; on which, at an early age, little dependence can be placed. Their treatment from the time they are weaned, in July or August, until the time of shearing, the first week in June, consists in giving them every indulgence of keep, in order to push them forward for the show; it being the common practice to let such as are fit to be let the first season, while they are yet yearlings—provincially 'harthogs.'\n\n\"Their first pasture, after weaning, is pretty generally, I believe, clover that has been mown early, and has got a second time into head; the heads of clover being considered as a most forcing food of sheep. After this goes off, turnips, cabbages, colewort, with hay, and (report says) with corn. But the use of this the breeders severally deny, though collectively they may be liable to the charge.\n\n\"Be this as it may, something considerable depends on the art of making up, not lambs only, but rams of all ages. Fat, like charity, covers a multitude of faults; and besides, is the best evidence of their fattening quality which their owners can produce (i.e., their natural propensity to a state of fatness), while in the fatness of the harthogs is seen their degree of inclination to fat at an early age.\n\n\"Fattening quality being the one thing needful in grazing flock, and being found, in some considerable degree at least, to be hereditary, the fattest rams are of course the best; though other attachments, well or ill placed, as to form or fashionable points, will perhaps have equal or greater weight in the minds of some men, even in this enlightened age. Such shearings as will not make up sufficiently as to form and fatness, are either kept on to another year to give them a fair chance, or are castrated, or butchered while harthogs.\"\n\nFrom the first letting, about 40 years ago, to the year 1780, the prices kept gradually rising from fifteen shillings to a guinea, and from one to ten. In 1780 well-received Mr Bakewell let several at ten guineas each; and, what is rather inexplicable, Mr Packington of Quarndon let them the same year for twenty-five guineas; a price which then astonished the whole country.\n\nFrom that time to 1786 Mr Bakewell's stock rose rapidly from ten to a hundred guineas; and that year he let two thirds of one ram (referring one third of the usual number of ewes to himself) to two principal breeders, for a hundred guineas each, the entire services of the ram being rated at three hundred guineas! Mr Bakewell making that year, by letting twenty rams only, more than a thousand pounds!\n\nSince that time the prices have been still rising. Four hundred guineas have been repeatedly given. Mr Bakewell, this year (1789) makes, says Mr Marshall, twelve hundred guineas by three rams (brothers, we believe); two thousand of seven; and of his whole letting, full three thousand guineas!\n\nBeside this extraordinary sum made by Mr Bakewell, there are six or seven other breeders who make from five hundred to a thousand guineas each. The whole amount of moneys produced that year in the midland counties, by letting rams of the modern breed for one season only, is estimated, by those who are adequate to the subject, at the almost incredible sum of ten thousand pounds.\n\nRams previous to the season are reduced from the cumbrous fat state in which they are shown. The usual\nThey are conveyed in carriages of two wheels with springs, or hung in slings, 20 or 30 miles a day, sometimes to the distance of 200 or 300 miles. They are not turned loose among the ewes, but kept apart in a small inclosure, where a couple of ewes only are admitted at once. When the season is over, every care is taken to make the rams look as fat and handsome as possible.\n\nIn the choice of ewes the breeder is led by the same criterions as in the choice of rams. Breed is the first object of consideration. Excellency, in any species or variety of live-stock, cannot be attained with any degree of certainty, let the male be ever so excellent, unless the females employed likewise inherit a large proportion of the genuine blood, be the species or variety what it may. Hence no prudent man ventures to give the higher prices for the Dithley rams, unless his ewes are deeply tinctured with the Dithley blood. Next to breed is flesh, fat, form, and wool.\n\nAfter the lambs are weaned, the ewes are kept in common feeding places, without any alteration of pasture, previous to their taking the ram. In winter they are kept on grass, hay, turnips, and cabbages. As the heads of the modern breed are much finer than most others, the ewes lamb with less difficulty.\n\nThe female lambs, on being weaned, are put to good keep, but have not such high indulgence shown them as the males, the prevailing practice being to keep them from the ram the first autumn.\n\nAt weaning time, or previously to the admittance of the ram, the ewes are culled, to make room for the thaves or shearlings, whose superior blood and fashion entitle them to a place in the breeding flock. In the work of culling, the ram-breeder and the mere grazier go by somewhat different guides. The grazier's guide is principally age, seldom giving his ewes the ram after they are four shear. The ram-breeder, on the contrary, goes chiefly by merit; an ewe that has brought him a good ram or two is continued in the flock so long as the will breed. There are instances of ewes having been prolific to the tenth or twelfth year; but in general the ewes of this breed go off at six or seven shear.\n\nIn the practice of some of the principal ram-breeders, the culling ewes are never suffered to go out of their hands until after they are slaughtered, the breeders not only fattening them, but having them butchered, on their premises. There are others, however, who sell them; and sometimes at extraordinary prices. Three, four, and even so high as ten guineas each, have been given for these outcasts.\n\nThere are in the flocks of several breeders ewes that would fetch at auction twenty guineas each. Mr Backett is in possession of ewes which, if they were now put up to be sold to the best bidder, would, it is estimated, fetch no less than fifty each, and perhaps, through the present spirit of contention, much higher prices.\n\nThe following instructions for purchasing sheep, we hope, will be acceptable to our country readers.—The farmer should always buy his sheep from a worse land than his own, and they should be big-boned, and have a long greasy wool, curling close and well. These sheep always breed the finest wool, and are also the most approved of by the butcher for sale in the market. For the choice of sheep to breed, the ram must be young, and his skin of the same colour with his wool, for the lambs will be of the same colour with his skin. He should have a large long body; a broad forehead, round, and well-rising; large eyes; and straight and short nostrils. The polled sheep, that is, those which have no horns, are found to be the best breeders. The ewe should have a broad back; a large bending neck; small, but short, clean, and nimble legs; and a thick, deep wool covering her all over.\n\nTo know whether they be found or not, the farmer should examine the wool that none of it be wanting, and see that the gums be red, the teeth white and even, and the brisket-akin red, the wool firm, the breath sweet, and the feet not hot. Two years old is the best time for beginning to breed; and their first lambs should not be kept too long, to weaken them by suckling, but be sold as soon as conveniently may be. They will breed advantageously till they are seven years old. The farmers have a method of knowing the age of a sheep, as a horse's is known, by the mouth. When a sheep is one shear, as they express it, it has two broad teeth before; when it is two shear, it will have four; when three, six; and when four, eight. After this their mouths begin to break.\n\nThe difference of land makes a very great difference in the sheep. The fat pastures breed straight tall sheep, and the barren hills and downs breed square short ones; woods and mountains breed tall and slender sheep; but the best of all are those bred upon newly-ploughed land and dry grounds. On the contrary, all wet and moist lands are bad for sheep, especially such as are subject to be overflowed, and to have land and dirt left on them. The salt marshes are, however, an exception to this general rule, for their saltness makes amends for their moisture; salt, by reason of its drying quality, being of great advantage to sheep.\n\nAs to the time of putting the rams to the ewes, the farmer must consider at what time of the spring his grass ought to be fit to maintain them and their lambs, and whether he has turnips to do it till the grass comes; for to the very often both the ewes and lambs are destroyed by the want of food; or if this does not happen, if the lambs are only stinted in their growth by it, it is an accident that they never recover. The ewe goes 20 weeks with lamb, and according to this it is easy to calculate the proper time. The best time for them to yean is in April, unless the owner has very forward grass or turnips, or the sheep are field sheep. Where you have not inclosures to keep them in, then it may be proper they should yean in January, that the lambs may be strong by May-day, and be able to follow the dam over the fallows and water-furrows; but then the lambs that come so early must have a great deal of care taken of them, and so indeed should all other lambs at their first falling, else while they are weak the crows and magpies will pick their eyes out.\n\nWhen the sheep are turned into fields of wheat or rye to feed, it must not be too rank at first, for if it be, it generally throws them into scourings. Ewes that are big should be kept but bare, for it is very dangerous to them to be fat at the time of their bringing forth their young. They may be well fed, indeed, like cows, a fortnight beforehand, to put them in heart. Mortimer's Husbandry, p. 243.\nThe feeding sheep with turnips is one great advantage to the farmers. When they are made to eat turnips they soon fatten, but there is some difficulty in bringing this about. The old ones always refuse them at first, and will sometimes fast three or four days, till almost famished; but the young lambs fall to at once. The common way, in some places, of turning a flock of sheep at large into a field of turnips, is very disadvantageous, for they will thus destroy as many in a fortnight as would keep them a whole winter. There are three other ways of feeding them on this food, all of which have their several advantages.\n\nThe first way is to divide the land by hurdles, and allow the sheep to come upon such a portion only at a time as they can eat in one day, and so advance the hurdles farther into the ground daily till all be eaten. This is infinitely better than the former random method; but they never eat them clean even this way, but leave the bottoms and outsides scooped in the ground: the people pull up these indeed with iron crooks, and lay them before the sheep again, but they are commonly so fouled with the creature's dung and urine, and with the dirt from their feet, that they do not care for them; they eat but little of them, and what they do eat does not nourish them like the fresh roots.\n\nThe second way is by inclosing the sheep in hurdles, as in the former; but in this they pull up all the turnips which they suppose the sheep can eat in one day, and daily remove the hurdles over the ground whence they have pulled up the turnips: by this means there is no waste, and less expense, for a person may in two hours pull up all those turnips; the remaining thills of which would have employed three or four labourers a-day to get up with their crooks out of the ground trodden hard by the feet of the sheep; and the worst is, that as in the method of pulling up first, the turnips are eaten up clean, in this way, by the hook, they are wasted, the sheep do not eat any great part of them, and when the ground comes to be tilled afterwards for a crop of corn, the fragments of the turnips are seen in such quantities on the surface, that half the crop at least seems to have been wasted.\n\nThe third manner is to pull up the turnips, and remove them in a cart or waggon to some other place, spreading them on a fresh place every day; by this method the sheep will eat them up clean, both root and leaves. The great advantage of this method is, when there is a piece of land not far off which wants dung more than that where the turnips grew, which perhaps is also too wet for the sheep in winter, and then the turnips will, by the too great moisture and dirt of the soil, sometimes spoil the sheep, and give them the rot. Yet such ground will often bring forth more and larger turnips than dry land, and when they are carried off, and eaten by the sheep on ploughed land, in dry weather, and on greenward in wet weather, the sheep will succeed much better; and the moist soil where the turnips grew not being trodden by the sheep, will be much fitter for a crop of corn than if they had been fed with turnips on it. The expense of hurdles, and the trouble of moving them, are saved in this case, which will counterbalance at least the expense of pulling the turnips and carrying them to the places where they are to be eaten. They must always be carried off for oxen.\n\nThe diseases to which sheep are subject are these, rot, red-water, foot-rot and hoving, scab, dunt, rickets, sheep-fly-struck, flux, and burling. Of each of these we shall give the best description in our power, with the most approved remedies.\n\nThe rot, which is a very pernicious disease, has of late engaged the attention of scientific farmers. But neither its nature nor its cause has yet been fully ascertained. Some valuable and judicious observations have, however, been made upon it, which ought to be circulated, as they may perhaps, in many cases, furnish an antidote for this malignant distemper, or be the means of leading others to some more efficacious remedy. Some have supposed the rot owing to the quick growth of grass or herbs that grow in wet places. Without premising, that all bounteous Providence has given to every animal its peculiar taste, by which it distinguishes the food proper for its preservation and support, if not vitiated by fortuitous circumstances, it seems very difficult to discover on philosophical principles why the quick growth of grass should render it noxious, or why any herb should at one season produce fatal effects, by the admixture of pure water only into its component parts, which at other times is perfectly innocent, although brought to its utmost strength and maturity by the genial influence of the sun. Besides, the constant practice of most farmers in the kingdom, who with the greatest security feed their meadows in the spring, when the grass shoots quick and is full of juices, militates directly against this opinion.\n\nMr Arthur Young ascribes this disease to moisture. In confirmation of this opinion, which has been generally adopted, we are informed, in the Bath Society papers*, by a correspondent, that there was a paddock adjoining his park which had for several years caused art. xvi. the rot in most of the sheep which were put into it. In 1769 he drained it, and from that time his sheep were free from this malady. But there are facts which render it doubtful that moisture is the sole cause. We are told, the dry limed land in Derbyshire will produce the rot as well as water meadows and stagnant marshes; and that in some wet grounds sheep sustain no injury for many weeks.\n\nWithout attempting to enumerate other hypotheses which the ingenious have formed on this subject, we shall pursue a different method in order to discover the cause. On dissecting sheep that die of this disorder, a great number of insects called fleas (see Fasciola) are found in the liver. That these fleas are the cause of the rot, therefore, is evident; but to explain how they come into the liver is not so easy. It is probable that they are swallowed by the sheep along with their food while in the egg state. The eggs deposited in the tender germ are conveyed with the food into the stomach and intestines of the animals, whence they are received into the lacteal vessels, carried off in the chyle, and pass into the blood; nor do they meet with any obstruction until they arrive at the capillary vessels of the liver. Here, as the blood filtrates through the extreme branches, answering to those of the vena porta in the human body, the feces of the vessels are too minute to admit the impregnated ova, which, adhering to the membrane, produce those animalculæ that feed upon the liver and destroy the sheep. They much resemble the flat fish called plaice, are sometimes as large as a silver two-pence, and are found both in the liver and in\nthe pipe (answering to that of the *vena cava*) which conveys the blood from the liver to the heart.\n\nThe common and most obvious objection to that opinion is, that this insect is never found but in the liver, or in some parts of the viscera, of sheep that are diseased more or less; and that they must therefore be bred there. But this objection will lose its force, when we consider that many insects undergo several changes, and exist under forms extremely different from each other. Some of them may therefore appear and be well known under one shape, and not known to be the same under a second or third. The fluke may be the last stage of some aquatic animal which we at present very well know under one or other of its previous forms.\n\nIf this be admitted, it is easy to conceive that sheep may, on wet ground especially, take multitudes of these ova or eggs in with their food; and that the stomach and viscera of the sheep being a proper nidus for them, they of course hatch, and appearing in their fluke or larval state, feed on the liver of the animal, and occasion this disorder.\n\nIt is a singular fact, \"that no ewe ever has the rot while she has a lamb by her side.\" The reason of this may be, that the impregnated ovum passes into the milk, and never arrives at the liver. The rot is fatal to sheep, hares, and rabbits, and sometimes to calves; but never infects animals of a larger size.\n\nMiller says that parsley is a good remedy for the rot in sheep. Perhaps a strong decoction of this plant, or the oil extracted from its seeds, might be of service. Salt is also a useful remedy. It seems to be an acknowledged fact, that salt marl does never produce the rot. Salt indeed is pernicious to most insects. Common salt and water expel worms from the human body; and sea weed, if laid in a garden, will drive away insects; but if the salt is separated by steeping it in the purest spring water for a few days, it abounds with animalcule of various species.\n\nLittle, in his book of husbandry, informs us of a farmer who cured his whole flock of the rot by giving each sheep a handful of Spanish salt for five or six mornings successively. The hint was probably taken from the Spaniards, who frequently give their sheep salt to keep them healthy. On some farms perhaps the utmost caution cannot always prevent this disorder. In wet and warm seasons the prudent farmer will remove his sheep from the lands liable to rot. Those who have it not in their power to do this may give each sheep a spoonful of common salt, with the same quantity of flour, in a quarter of a pint of water, once or twice a-week. At the commencement of the rot the same remedy given four or five mornings successively will in all probability effect a cure. The addition of the flour and water, it is supposed, not only abates the pungency of the salt, but dispenses it to mix with the chyle in a more gentle and efficacious manner.\n\nA farmer of a considerable lordship in Bohemia visiting the hot-wells of Carlsbad, related how he preserved his flocks of sheep from the mortal distemper which raged in the wet year 1762, of which so many perished. His preservative was very simple and very cheap: \"He fed them every night, when turned under a shed, cover, or stables, with halved fodder straw; and, by eating it greedily, they all escaped.\"\n\n\"Red water is a disorder most prevalent on wet grounds. I have heard (says Mr Arthur Young) that ter. it has sometimes been cured by tapping, as for a drop fy. This operation is done on one side of the belly towards the flank, just below the wool.\n\n\"The foot-rot and hoving, which is very common on low fenny grounds, is cured by keeping the part clean, and lying at rest in a dry pasture.\"\n\nThe *scab* is a cutaneous disease owing to an impurity of the blood, and is most prevalent in wet lands or rainy seasons. It is cured by tobacco-water, brimstone, and alum, boiled together, and then rubbed over the sheep. If only partial, tar and grease may be sufficient. But the simplest and most efficacious remedy for this disease was communicated to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c., by Sir Joseph Banks.\n\n\"Take one pound of quicksilver, half a pound of Venice turpentine, half a pint of oil of turpentine, and commend four pounds of hogs lard (c). Let them be rubbed in a mortar till the quicksilver is thoroughly incorporated with the other ingredients; for the proper mode of doing which, it may be proper to take the advice, or even the affluence, of some apothecary or other person used to make such mixtures.\n\n\"The method of using the ointment is this: Beginning at the head of the sheep, and proceeding from between the ears along, the back to the end of the tail, the wool is to be divided in a furrow till the skin can be touched; and as the furrow is made, the finger slightly dipped in the ointment is to be drawn along the bottom of it, where it will leave a blue stain on the skin and adjoining wool: from this furrow similar ones must be drawn down the shoulders and thighs to the legs, as far as they are woolly; and if the animal is much infected, two more should be drawn along each side parallel to that on the back, and one down each side between the fore and hind legs.\n\n\"Immediately after being dressed, it is usual to turn the sheep among other flock, without any fear of the infection being communicated; and there is scarcely an instance of a sheep suffering any injury from the application. In a few days the blotches dry up, the itching ceases, and the animal is completely cured: it is generally, however, thought proper not to delay the operation beyond Michaelmas.\n\n\"The *hippopotoma ovina*, called in Lincolnshire *sheep fagg*, an animal well known to all shepherds, which lives among the wool, and is hurtful to the thriving of sheep both by the pain its bite occasions and the blood it sucks, is destroyed by this application, and the wool is not at all injured. Our wool-buyers purchase the fleeces on which the stain of the ointment is visible, rather in preference to others, from an opinion that the use of it\n\n(c) By some unaccountable mistake the last ingredient, the four pounds of hogs lard, is omitted in the receipt published in the Transactions of the Society; a circumstance that might be productive of bad effects.—The leaf which contained the receipt has since been cancelled, and a new one printed.\nit having preserved the animal from being vexed either with the scab or faggots, the wool is less liable to the defects of joints or knots; a fault observed to proceed from every sudden stop in the thriving of the animal, either from want of food or from disease.\n\n\"This mode of curing was brought into that part of Lincolnshire where my property is situated about 12 years ago, by Mr Stephenson of Marcham, and is now so generally received, that the scab, which used to be the terror of the farmers, and which frequently deterred the more careful of them from taking the advantage of pasturing their sheep in the fertile and extensive commons with which that district abounds, is no longer regarded with any apprehension: by far the most of them have their flock anointed in autumn, when they return from the common, whether they show any symptoms of scab or not; and having done so, conclude them safe for some time from either giving or receiving infection. There are people who employ themselves in the business, and contract to anoint our large sheep at five shillings a score, insuring for that price the success of the operation; that is, agreeing, in case many of the sheep break out afresh, to repeat the operation gratis even some months afterwards.\"\n\nThe dunt is a distemper caused by a bladder of water gathering in the head. No cure for this has yet been discovered.\n\nThe rickets is a hereditary disease for which no antidote is known. The first symptom is a kind of light-headedness, which makes the affected sheep appear wilder than usual when the shepherd or any person approaches him. He bounces up suddenly from his lare, and runs to a distance, as though he were pursued by dogs. In the second stage the principal symptom is the sheep's rubbing himself against trees, &c., with such fury as to pull off his wool and tear away his flesh.\n\n\"The distressed animal has now a violent itching in his skin, the effect of a highly inflamed blood; but it does not appear that there is ever any cutaneous eruption or salutary critical discharge. In short, from all circumstances, the fever appears now to be at its height.\"\n\nThe last stage of this disease \"seems only to be the progress of dissolution, after an unfavourable crisis. The poor animal, as condemned by Nature, appears stupid, walks irregularly (whence probably the name rickets), generally lies, and eats little; these symptoms increase in degree till death, which follows a general consumption, as appears upon dissection of the carcase; the juices and even solids having suffered a general dissolution.\n\nIn order to discover the seat and nature of this disease, sheep that die of it ought to be dissected. This is said to have been done by one gentleman, Mr Beal; and he found in the brain or membranes adjoining a maggot about a quarter of an inch long, and of a brownish colour. A few experiments might easily determine this fact.\n\nThe fly-struck is cured by clipping the wool off as far as infected, and rubbing the parts dry with lime or wood-ashes; curriers oil will heal the wounds, and prevent their being struck any more; or they may be cured with care, without clipping, with oil of turpentine, which will kill all the vermin where it goes; but the former is the surest way.\n\nThe flux is another disease to which sheep are subject. The best remedy is said to be, to house the sheep immediately when this distemper appears, to keep them very warm, and feed them on dry hay, giving them frequent glitters of warm milk and water. The cause of that distemper is either their feeding on wet lands, or on grass that is become mossy by the lands having been fed many years without being ploughed. When the farmer perceives his sheep-walks to become mossy, or to produce bad grass, he should either plough or manure with hot lime, making kilns either very near or in the sheep walks, because the hotter the lime is put on, the sweeter the grass comes up, and that early in the year.\n\nBuffling, or as it is called in some places the blaff, attacks sheep when driven into fresh grass or young cloving. They overeat themselves, foam at the mouth, swell exceedingly, breathe very quick and short, then jump up, and instantly fall down dead. In this case, the only chance of saving their life is by stabbing them in the maw with an instrument made for the purpose. The instrument is a hollow tube, with a pointed weapon passing through it. A hole is made with the pointed weapon; which is immediately withdrawn, and the hole is kept open by inserting the tube till the wind is discharged.\n\nSheep are infested with worms in their nose called acarus ovus, and produced from the egg of a large two-winged fly. The frontal sinuses above the nose in sheep worms and other animals are the places where these worms live which infect sheep and attain their full growth. These sinuses are always full of a soft white matter, which furnishes these worms with a proper nourishment, and are sufficiently large for their habitation; and when they have here acquired their defined growth, in which they are fit to undergo their changes for the fly-state, they leave their old habitation, and, falling to the earth, bury themselves there; and when these are hatched into flies, the female, when she has been impregnated by the male, knows that the nose of a sheep or other animal is the only place for her to deposit her eggs, in order to their coming to maturity. Mr Vallifineri, to whom the world owes so many discoveries in the infect class, is the first who has given any true account of the origin of these worms. But though their true history had been till that time unknown, the creatures themselves were very early discovered, and many ages since were esteemed great medicines in epilepsy.\n\nThe fly produced from this worm has all the time of its life a very lazy disposition, and does not like to make any use either of its legs or wings. Its head and corset together are about as long as its body, which is composed of five rings, streaked on the back; a pale yellow and brown are there disposed in irregular spots; the belly is of the same colours, but they are there more regularly disposed, for the brown here makes three lines, one in the middle, and one on each side, and all the intermediate spaces are yellow. The wings are nearly of the same length with the body, and are a little inclined in their position, so as to lie upon the body: they do not, however, cover it; but a naked space is left between them. The anterior or petty wings which are found under each of the wings are of a whitish colour, and perfectly cover the balancers, so that they are not to be seen without lifting up these.\n\nThe fly will live two months after it is first produced,\nTo find a proper composition for marking sheep is a matter of great importance, as great quantities of wool are every year rendered useless by the pitch and tar with which they are usually marked. The requisite qualities for such a composition are, that it be cheap, that the colour be strong and lasting, so as to bear the changes of weather, and not to injure the wool. Dr Lewis recommends for this purpose melted tallow, with so much charcoal in fine powder stirred into it as is sufficient to make it of a full black colour, and of a thick consistence. This mixture, being applied warm with a marking iron, on pieces of flannel, quickly fixed or hardened, bore moderate rubbing, resisted the sun and rain, and yet could be washed out freely with soap, or ley, or stale urine. In order to render it still more durable, and prevent its being rubbed off, with the tallow may be melted an eighth, sixth, or fourth, of its weight of tar, which will readily wash out along with it from the wool. Lewis's Com. Phil. Techn. p. 361.\n\n**Sheep-Stealing.** See Theft.\n\n**Sheering,** in the sea-language. When a ship is not fleered steadily, they say she fleers, or goes theoring; or when, at anchor, the goes in and out by means of the current of the tide, they also say she fleers.\n\n**Sheerness,** a fort in Kent, seated on the point where the river Medway falls into the Thames. It was built by King Charles II. after the insult of the Dutch, who burnt the men of war at Chatham. The buildings belonging to it, in which the officers lodge, make a pretty little neat town; and there is also a yard and a dock, a chapel and a chaplain. Mr Lyons, who sailed with the honourable Captain Phipps in his voyage towards the pole, fixed the longitude of Sheerness to 0° 48' E. its latitude 51° 25'.\n\n**Sheers,** a name given to an engine used to hoist or displace the lower masts of a ship. The sheers employed for this purpose in the royal navy are composed of several long masts, whose heels rest upon the side of the bulk, and having their heads declining outward from the perpendicular, so as to hang over the vessel whose masts are to be fixed or displaced. The tackles, which extend from the head of the mast to the sheerheads, are intended to pull in the latter toward the masthead, particularly when they are charged with the weight of a mast after it is raised out of any ship, which is performed by strong tackles depending from the sheerheads. The effort of these tackles is produced by two capstans, fixed on the deck for this purpose.\n\nIn merchant ships this machine is composed of two masts or props, erected in the same vessel wherein the mast is to be planted, or from whence it is to be removed. The lower ends of these props rest on the opposite sides of the deck, and their upper parts are fastened across, so as that a tackle which hangs from the intersection may be almost perpendicularly above the station of the mast to which the mechanical powers are applied. These sheers are secured by stays which extend forward and aft to the opposite extremities of the vessel.\n\n**Sheers,** aboard a ship, an engine used to hoist or displace the lower masts of a ship.\n\n**Sheet-Lead.** See Plumbery.\n\n**Sheet,** in sea-language, a rope fastened to one or both the lower corners of a sail, to extend and retain it in a particular station. When a ship sails with a lateral wind, the lower corner of the main and fore sail are fastened by a tack and a fleet; the former being to windward, and the latter to leeward; the tack, however, is entirely diffused with a stern wind, whereas the fall is never spread without the affiance of one or both of the fleets. The stay-sails and studding sails have only one tack and one fleet each; the stay-sail tacks are always fastened forward, and the fleet drawn aft; but the studding-sail tack draws the under clue of the fall to the extremity of the boom, whereas the fleet is employed to extend the inmost.\n\n**Sheffield,** a town in the west riding of Yorkshire, about 162 miles from London, is a large, thriving town on the borders of Derbyshire, with a population of 31,314 souls; has a fine stone bridge over the Don, and another over the Sheaf, and a church built in the reign of Henry I. It had a castle built in the reign of Henry III. in which, or else in the manor-house of the Park, Mary queen of Scots was prisoner 16 or 17 years; but after the death of Charles I. it was with several others, by order of parliament demolished. In 1673 an hospital was erected here, and endowed with 200l. a-year. There is a charity-school for 30 boys, and another for 30 girls. This town has been noted several hundred years for cutlers and smiths manufactures, which were encouraged and advanced by the neighbouring mines of iron, particularly for files, and knives or whistles; for the last of which especially it has been a staple for above 300 years; and it is reputed to excel Birmingham in these wares, as much as it is surpassed by it in locks, hinges, nails, and polished steel. The first mills in England for turning grindstones were also set up here. The houses look black from the continual smoke of the forges. Here are 600 master cutlers, incorporated by the style of the Cutlers of Hallamshire (of which this is reckoned the chief town), who employ no less than 40,000 persons in the iron manufactures; and each of the masters gives a particular stamp to his wares. There is a large market on Tuesday for many commodities, but especially for corn, which is bought up here for the whole west riding, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire. It has fairs on Tuesday after Trinity-Sunday, and November 28. In the new market-place, erected by the duke of Norfolk, the shambles are built upon a most excellent plan, and strongly inclosed. There are several other new good buildings, such as a large and elegant octagon chapel belonging to the hospital or almshouses; likewise a good assembly-room and theatre. We must not omit the large steam-engine, lately finished, for the purpose of polishing and grinding the various fonts of hardware. The parish being very large, as well as populous, Mary I. incorporated 12 of the chief inhabitants, and their successors for ever, by the style of the Twelve Capital Burgesses of Sheffield, empowering them to elect and ordain three priests to assist the vicar, who were to be paid out of certain lands and rents which she gave out of the crown; and since this settlement two more chapels have been built in two hamlets of this parish.\nJames I. founded a free grammar-school here, and appointed 13 school burgesses to manage the revenue, and appoint the master and usher. A new chapel was built lately by the contributions of the people of the town and of the neighbouring nobility and gentry. Water is conveyed by pipes into Sheffield, whose inhabitants pay but a moderate rent for it. In the neighbourhood there are some mines of alum. The remains of the Roman fortification between this town and Rotherham, which is six miles lower down the river, are still visible; and here also is the famous trench of five miles long, by some called Devil's or Dane's Bank, and by others Kemp Bank and Temple's Bank. West Long. 1. 29. N. Lat. 13. 20.\n\nSheffield, John, duke of Buckinghamshire, an eminent writer of the 17th and 18th century, of great personal bravery, and an able minister of state, was born about 1650. He lost his father at nine years of age; and his mother marrying Lord Ossulston, the care of his education was left entirely to a governor, who did not greatly improve him in his studies. Finding that he was deficient in many parts of literature, he resolved to devote a certain number of hours every day to his studies; and thereby improved himself to the degree of learning he afterwards attained. Though possessed of a good estate, he did not abandon himself to pleasure and indolence, but entered a volunteer in the second Dutch war; and accordingly was in that famous naval engagement where the duke of York commanded as admiral: on which occasion his lordship behaved so gallantly, that he was appointed commander of the Royal Catherine. He afterward made a campaign in the French service under M. de Turenne. As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were sent to defend it; and accordingly was appointed to command them. He was then earl of Mulgrave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to King Charles II. The Moors retired on the approach of his majesty's forces; and the result of the expedition was the blowing up of Tangier. He continued in several great posts during the short reign of King James II. till that unfortunate prince was dethroned. Lord Mulgrave, though he paid his respects to King William before he was advanced to the throne, yet did not accept of any post in the government till some years after. In the fifth year of William and Mary he was created marquis of Normanby in the county of Lincoln. He was one of the most active and zealous opposers of the bill which took away Sir John Fenwick's life; and exerted the utmost vigour in carrying through the Treason Bill, and the bill for Triennial Parliaments. He enjoyed some considerable posts under King William, and enjoyed much of his favour and confidence. In 1702 he was sworn lord privy-seal; and in the same year was appointed one of the commissioners to treat of an union between England and Scotland. In 1703 he was created duke of Normanby, and soon after duke of Buckinghamshire. In 1711 he was made steward of her majesty's household, and president of the council. During Queen Anne's reign he was but once out of employment; and then he voluntarily resigned, being attached to what were called the Tory principles. Her majesty offered to make him lord chancellor; but he declined the office. He was instrumental in the change of the ministry in 1712. A circumstance that reflects the highest honour on him is, the vigour with which he acted in favour of the unhappy Catalans, who afterward were so inhumanly sacrificed. He was survived by only one legitimate son (who died at Rome in 1735); but left several natural children. He died in 1721. He was admired by the poets of his age; by Dryden, Prior, and Garth. His Essay on Poetry was applauded by Addison, and his Recreations is still read with pleasure. His writings were splendidly printed in 1723, in two volumes 4to; and have since been reprinted in 1729, in two volumes 8vo. The first contains his poems on various subjects; the second, his prose works; which consist of historical memoirs, speeches in parliament, characters, dialogues, critical observations, essays, and letters. It may be proper to observe, that the edition of 1729 is calibrated; some particulars relating to the revolution in that of 1723 having given offence.\n\nSheffieldia, a genus of plants belonging to the class of pentandra, and to the order of monogynia.

On discovering a large piece of gold, they kill a sheep on it before it is removed. Their marriage is a simple agreement to cohabit.

There are more or fewer of these to every mosque, according to its size or revenue. One of these is head over the rest, and answers to a parish-priest with us; and has under him, in large mosques, the readers, and people who cry out to go to prayers; but in small mosques the sheik is obliged to do all this himself. In such it is their business to open the mosque, to cry to prayers, and to begin their short devotions at the head of the congregation, who stand rank and file in great order, and make all their motions together. Every Friday the sheik makes an harangue to his congregation.\n\nSheik-Bellet, the name of an officer in the Oriental nations. In Egypt the sheik-bellet is the head of a city, and is appointed by the pasha. The business of this officer is to take care that no innovations be made which may be prejudicial to the Porte, and that they send no orders which may hurt the liberties of the people. But all his authority depends on his credit and interest, not his office: for the government of Egypt is of such a kind, that often the people of the least power\nby their pots have the greatest influence; and a caia of\nthe janizaries or Arabs, and sometimes one of their\nmeinest officers, an oda-bahia, finds means, by his parts\nand abilities, to govern all things.\n\nSHEILDS.

The bottom, or part opposite to the\nfuse, is made thicker than the rest, that the fuse may\nfall uppermost. But in small elevations this does not\nalways happen nor indeed is it necessary; for, let the\nshell fall as it will, the fuse fires the powder within,\nwhich bursts the shell, and causes great devastation.\nThe shells had much better be of an equal thickness; for\nthen they burst into more pieces.\n\nMessage SHELLS, are nothing more than howitz-\nshells, in the inside of which a letter or other papers are\nput; the fuse hole is stopped up with wood or cork, and\nthe shells are fired out of a royal or howitz, either into\na garrison or camp.

Among the oviparous kinds, anato-\nmists have found that some species are of different sexes,\nin the different individuals of the same species; but others\nare hermaphrodites, every one being in itself both male\nand female.

See Dyeing of LEATHER.\n\nSHENSTONE, WILLIAM, an admired English poet, the eldest son of a plain country gentleman, who\nfarmed his own estate in Shropshire, was born in No-\nvember 1714. He learned to read of an old dame,\nwhom his poem of the \"School-mistress\" has deliver-\ned to posterity; and soon received such delight from\nbooks, that he was always calling for new entertain-\nment, and expected that, when any of the family went\nto market, a new book should be brought him, which,\nwhen it came, was in fondness carried to bed, and laid\nby him. It is said, that when his request had been ne-\nglected, his mother wrapped up a piece of wood of the\nsame form, and pacified him for the night. As he\ngrew older, he went for a while to the grammar-school\nin Hales-Owen, and was placed afterwards with Mr\nCrompton, an eminent school-master at Solihul, where\nhe distinguished himself by the quickness of his progress.\nWhen he was young (June 1724), he was deprived of his\nfather; and soon after (August 1726) of his grandfa-\nther; and was, with his brother, who died afterwards\nunmarried, left to the care of his grandmother, who\nmanaged the estate. From school he was sent, in 1732,\nto Pembroke college in Oxford, a society which for half\na century has been eminent for English poetry and ele-\ngant literature. Here it appears that he found delight\nand advantage; for he continued his name there ten\nyears, though he took no degree. After the first four\nyears he put on the civilian's gown, but without show-\ning any intention to engage in the profession. About\nthe time when he went to Oxford, the death of his\ngrandmother devolved his affairs to the care of the\nreverend Mr Dolman, of Brome, in Staffordshire,\nwhose attention he always mentioned with gratitude.\n—At Oxford he applied to English poetry; and, in\n1737, published a small Miscellany, without his\nname. He then for a time wandered about, to ac-\nquaint himself with life, and was sometimes at Lon-\ndon, sometimes at Bath, or any place of public resort;\nbut he did not forget his poetry. He published, in\n1740, his \"Judgement of Hercules,\" addressed to Mr\nLyttleton, whose interest he supported with great warmth\nat an election; this was two years afterwards followed\nby the \"School-mistress.\" Mr Dolman, to whose care\nhe was indebted for his ease and leisure, died in 1745,\nand the care of his fortune now fell upon himself. He\ntried to escape it a while, and lived at his house with his\ntenants, who were distantly related; but, finding that\nimperfect possession inconvenient, he took the whole\nestate into his own hands, an event which rather im-\nproved its beauty than increased its produce. Now be-\ngan his delight in rural pleasures, and his passion of ru-\nral elegance; but in time his expenses occasioned clam-\nours that overpowered the lamb's bleat and the lin-\nnet's song; and his groves were haunted by beings very\ndifferent from fauns and fairies. He spent his estate in\nadorning it, and his death was probably hastened by his\nanxieties. He was a lamp that spent its oil in blazing.\nIt is said, that if he had lived a little longer, he would\nhave been afflicted by a pension; such bounty could not\nhave been more properly bestowed, but that it was ever\nasked is not certain; it is too certain that it never was\nenjoyed.—He died at the Leaowes, of a putrid fever,\nabout five on Friday morning, Feb. 11, 1763; and was\nburied by the side of his brother, in the churchyard of\nHales-Owen.\nIn his private opinions, our author adhered to no particular tenets, and hated all religious disputes. Tenderness, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; and his friends, domestics, and poor neighbours, daily experienced the effects of his benevolence. This virtue he carried to an excess that seemed to border upon weakness; yet if any of his friends treated him ungenerously, he was not easily reconciled. On such occasions, however, he used to say, \"I never will be a revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend.\" He was no economist; for the generosity of his temper prevented his paying a proper regard to the use of money: he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune. But, if we consider the perfect paradise into which he had converted his estate, the hospitality with which he lived, his charities to the indigent, and all out of an estate that did not exceed £300 a-year, one should rather wonder that he left anything behind him, than blame his want of economy: he yet left more than sufficient to pay all his debts, and by his will appropriated his whole estate to that purpose. Though he had a high opinion of many of the fair sex, he forbore to marry. A passion he entertained in his youth was with difficulty surmounted. The lady was the subject of that admirable pastoral, in four parts, which has been so universally read and admired, and which, one would have thought, must have softened the proudest and most obdurate heart. His works have been published by Mr Dodley, in 3 vols 8vo. The first volume contains his poetical works, which are particularly distinguished by an amiable elegance and beautiful simplicity; the second volume contains his prose works; the third his letters, &c.\n\n**Biog.

They are described as being unable to afford their son the advantages of a liberal education; but he, being observed to give early indications of genius, attracted the notice of a friend to his family, who sent him to the college of Dublin, and contributed towards his support while he remained there. He afterwards entered into orders, and set up a school in Dublin, which long maintained a very high degree of reputation, as well for the attention bestowed on the morals of the scholars as for their proficiency in literature. So great was the estimation in which this seminary was held, that it is asserted to Sheridan have produced in some years the sum of £1000. It does not appear that he had any considerable preference; but his intimacy with Swift, in 1725, procured for him a living in the south of Ireland worth about £500 a-year, which he went to take possession of, and, by an act of inadvertence, destroyed all his future expectations of rising in the church; for being at Cork on the 11th of August, the anniversary of King George's birth-day, he preached a sermon, which had for its text, \"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\" On this being known, he was struck out of the list of chaplains to the lord lieutenant, and forbidden the castle.\n\nThis living Dr Sheridan afterwards changed for that of Dunboyne, which, by the knavery of the farmers, and power of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, fell to no less than £80 per annum. He gave it up for the free school of Cavan, where he might have lived well in so cheap a country on £80 a-year salary, besides his scholars; but the air being, as he said, too moist and unwholesome, and being disgusted with some persons who lived there, he sold the school for about £400; and having food spent the money, he fell into bad health, and died Sept. 10, 1738, in his 55th year.\n\nLord Corke has given the following character of him: \"Dr Sheridan was a school-master, and in many instances perfectly well adapted for that station. He was deeply versed in the Greek and Roman languages, and in their customs and antiquities. He had that kind of good nature which absence of mind, indolence of body, and carelessness of fortune, produce; and although not over strict in his own conduct, yet he took care of the morality of his scholars, whom he sent to the university remarkably well founded in all kinds of classical learning, and not ill instructed in the social duties of life. He was slovenly, indigent, and cheerful. He knew books much better than men; and he knew the value of money least of all. In this situation, and with this disposition, Swift fastened upon him as upon a prey with which he intended to regale himself whenever his appetite should prompt him.\" His Lordship then mentions the event of the unlucky sermon, and adds: \"This ill-starred, good-natured, improvident man, returned to Dublin, unhinged from all favour at court, and even banished from the castle. But still he remained a punster, a quibbler, a fiddler, and a wit. Not a day passed without a rebus, an anagram, or a madrigal. His pen and his fiddlestick were in continual motion; and yet to little or no purpose, if we may give credit to the following verses, which shall serve as the conclusion of his poetical character:\n\n\"With music and poetry equally blest'd,\n\"A bard thus Apollo most humbly address'd;\n\"Great author of poetry, music, and light,\n\"Instructed by thee, I both fiddle and write;\n\"Yet unheeded I scrape, or I scribble all day,\n\"My tunes are neglected, my verse flung away.\n\"Thy substitute here, Vice-Apollo didsains\n\"To vouch for my numbers, or lift to my strains.\n\"Thy manual sign he refuses to put\n\"To the airs I produce from the pen or the gut:\n\"Be thou then propitious, great Phoebus, and grant\n\"Relief, or reward, to my merit or want.\"\n\nG g\n\n\"Tho'\nSheridan, Sheriff.\n\n\"Tho' the Dean and Delany transcendently shine,\n\"O! brighten one solo or sonnet of mine:\n\"Make one work immortal, 'tis all I request.\n\"Apollon look'd pleas'd, and resolving to jest,\n\"Replied.—Honest friend, I've confer'd your case,\n\"Nor dislike your unmeaning and innocent face.\n\"Your petition I grant, the boon is not great,\n\"Your works shall continue, and here's the receipt:\n\"On rondeaus hereafter your fiddle-string spend,\n\"Write verses in circles, they never shall end.\"\n\n\"One of the volumes of Swift's miscellanies consists almost entirely of letters between him and the Dean. He published a prose translation of Peritus; to which he added the best notes of former editors, together with many judicious ones of his own. This work was printed at London, 1739, in 12mo. Biog. Dict.\n\nSheridan, Mrs Frances, wife to Thomas Sheridan, M.A., was born in Ireland about the year 1724, but descended from a good English family which had removed thither. Her maiden name was Chamberlaine, and she was grand-daughter of Sir Oliver Chamberlaine. The first literary performance by which she distinguished herself was a little pamphlet at the time of a violent party-dispute relative to the theatre, in which Mr Sheridan had newly embarked his fortune. So well-timed a work exciting the attention of Mr Sheridan, he by an accident discovered his fair patroness, to whom he was soon afterwards married. She was a person of the most amiable character in every relation of life, with the most engaging manners. After lingering some years in a very weak state of health, she died at Blois, in the south of France, in the year 1767. Her \"Sydney Biddulph\" may be ranked with the first productions of that class in ours or in any other language. She also wrote a little romance in one volume called Nouvijad, in which there is a great deal of imagination productive of an admirable moral. And she was the authoress of two comedies, \"The Discovery\" and \"The Dupe.\"\n\nSheriff, an officer, in each county in England, nominated by the king, invested with a judicial and ministerial power, and who takes place of every nobleman in the county during the time of his office.\n\nThe sheriff is an officer of very great antiquity in this kingdom, his name being derived from two Saxon words, signifying the reeve, bailiff, or officer of the shire. He is called in Latin vice-comes, as being the deputy of the earl or comes, to whom the custody of the shire is said to have been committed at the first division of this kingdom into counties. But the earls, in process of time, by reason of their high employments and attendance on the king's person, not being able to transact the business of the county, were delivered of that burden; reverting to themselves the honour, but the labour was laid on the sheriff. So that now the sheriff does all the king's business in the county; and though he be still called vice-comes, yet he is entirely independent of, and not subject to, the earl; the king, by his letters patent, committing custodiae comitatus to the sheriff, and to him alone.\n\nSheriffs were formerly chosen by the inhabitants of the several counties. In confirmation of which it was ordained, by statute 28 Edw. I. c. 8. that the people should have an election of sheriffs in every shire where the sheriffalty is not of inheritance. For anciently in some counties the sheriffs were hereditary; as we apprehend they were in Scotland till the statute 20 Geo. II. c. 43; and still continue in the county of Westmoreland to this day; the city of London having also the inheritance of the sheriffalty of Middlesex vested in their body by charter. The reason of these popular elections is assigned in the same statute, c. 13. \"that the commons might choose such as would not be a burden to them.\" And herein appears plainly a strong trace of the democratical part of our constitution; in which form of government it is an indispensable requisite, that the people should choose their own magistrates. This election was in all probability not absolutely vested in the commons, but required the royal approbation. For in the Gothic constitution, the judges of their county courts (which office is executed by the sheriff) were elected by the people, but confirmed by the king; and the form of their election was thus managed; the people, or incolae territorii, chose twelve electors, and they nominated three persons, ex quibus rex unum confirmaret. But, with us in England, these popular elections, growing tumultuous, were put an end to by the statute 9 Edw. II. st. 2. which enacted, that the sheriffs should from thenceforth be assigned by the chancellor, treasurer, and the judges; as being persons in whom the same trust might with confidence be reposed. By statutes 14 Edw. III. c. 7. 23 Hen. VI. c. 8. and 21 Hen. VIII. c. 20. the chancellor, treasurer, president of the king's council, chief justices, and chief barons, are to make this election; and that on the morrow of All Souls, in the exchequer. And the king's letters patent, appointing the new sheriffs, used commonly to bear date the sixth day of November. The statute of Cambridge, 12 Ric. II. c. 2. ordains, that the chancellor, treasurer, keeper of the privy seal, steward of the king's house, the king's chamberlain, clerk of the rolls, the justices of the one bench and the other, barons of the exchequer, and all other that shall be called to ordain, name, or make justices of the peace, sheriffs, and other officers of the king, shall be sworn to act indifferently, and to name no man that sueth to be put in office, but such only as they shall judge to be the best and most sufficient. And the custom now is (and has been at least ever since the time of Fortescue, who was chief justice and chancellor to Henry the fifth), that all the judges, together with the other great officers, meet in the exchequer chamber on the morrow of All Souls yearly, (which day is now altered to the morrow of St Martin, by the last act for abbreviating Michaelmas term), and then there propose three persons to the king, who afterwards appoints one of them to be sheriff. This custom of the twelve judges proposing three persons seems borrowed from the Gothic constitution before mentioned: with this difference, that among the Goths the 12 nominors were first elected by the people themselves. And this usage of ours, at its first introduction, there is reason to believe, was founded upon some statute, though not now to be found among our printed laws; first, because it is materially different from the direction of all the statutes before-mentioned; which it is hard to conceive that the judges would have countenanced by their concurrence, or that Fortescue would have inferred in his book, unless by the authority of some statute; and also, because a statute is expressly referred to in the record, which Sir Edward Coke tells...\nSheriff tells us he transferred from the council book of 3d March, 34 Hen. VI. and which is in substance as follows. The king had of his own authority appointed a man sheriff of Lincolnshire, which office he refused to take upon him; whereupon the opinions of the judges were taken, what should be done in this behalf. And the two chief justices, Sir John Fortescue and Sir John Priolet, delivered the unanimous opinion of them all; \"that the king did an error when he made a person sheriff that was not chosen and presented to him according to the statute; that the person refusing was liable to no fine for disobedience, as if he had been one of the three persons chosen according to the tenor of the statute; that they would advise the king to have recourse to the three persons that were chosen according to the statute, or that some other thrifty man be invited to occupy the office for this year; and that, the next year, to eschew such inconveniences, the order of the statute in this behalf made be observed.\" But notwithstanding this unanimous resolution of all the judges of England, thus entered in the council-book, and the statute 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 26. § 61. which expressly recognizes this to be the law of the land, some of our writers have affirmed, that the king, by his prerogative, may name whom he pleases to be sheriff, whether chosen by the judges or not. This is grounded on a very particular case in the fifth year of Queen Elizabeth, when, by reason of the plague, there was no Michaelmas term kept at Westminster; so that the judges could not meet there in crassino animarum to nominate the sheriffs: whereupon the queen named them herself, without such previous assembly, appointing for the most part one of two remaining in the last year's list. And this case, thus circumstanced, is the only authority in our books for the making these extraordinary sheriffs. It is true, the reporter adds, that it was held that the queen by her prerogative might make a sheriff without the election of the judges, non obstante aliquo statuto in contrarium; but the doctrine of non obstante, which sets the prerogative above the laws, was effectually demolished by the bill of rights at the revolution, and abdicated Westminster-hall when King James abdicated the kingdom. However, it must be acknowledged, that the practice of occasionally naming what are called pocket-sheriffs, by the sole authority of the crown, hath uniformly continued to the reign of his present majesty; in which, it is believed, few (if any) instances have occurred.\n\nSheriffs, by virtue of several old statutes, are to continue in their office no longer than one year; and yet it hath been said that a sheriff may be appointed durante bene placito, or during the king's pleasure; and so is the form of the royal writ. Therefore, till a new sheriff be named, his office cannot be determined, unless by his own death, or the demise of the king; in which last case it was usual for the successor to send a new writ to the old sheriff; but now, by statute 1 Anne st. 1. c. 8. all officers appointed by the preceding king may hold their offices for six months after the king's demise, unless sooner displaced by the successor. We may farther observe, that by statute 1 Ric. II. c. 11. no man that has served the office of sheriff for one year can be compelled to serve the same again within three years after.\n\nWe shall find it is of the utmost importance to have the sheriff appointed according to law, when we consider his power and duty. These are either as a judge, as the keeper of the king's peace, as a ministerial officer of the superior courts of justice, or as the king's bailiff.\n\nIn his judicial capacity he is to hear and determine all causes of 40 shillings value and under, in his county-court; and he has also a judicial power in divers other civil cases. He is likewise to decide the elections of knights of the shire, (subject to the control of the House of Commons), of coroners, and of vendors; to judge of the qualification of voters, and to return such as he shall determine to be duly elected.\n\nAs the keepers of the king's peace, both by common law and special commission, he is the first man in the county, and superior in rank to any nobleman therein, during his office. He may apprehend, and commit to prison, all persons who break the peace, or attempt to break it; and may bind any one in a recognizance to keep the king's peace. He may, and is bound, ex officio, to pursue and take all traitors, murderers, felons, and other misdoers, and commit them to gaol for safe custody. He is also to defend his county against any of the king's enemies when they come into the land; and for this purpose, as well as for keeping the peace and pursuing felons, he may command all the people of his county to attend him; which is called the posse comitatus, or power of the county; which summons, every person above 15 years old, and under the degree of a peer, is bound to attend upon warning, under pain of fine and imprisonment. But though the sheriff is thus the principal conservator of the peace in his county, yet, by the express directions of the great charter, he, together with the constable, coroner, and certain other officers of the king, are forbidden to hold any pleas of the crown, or, in other words, to try any criminal offence. For it would be highly unbecoming, that the executioners of justice should be also the judges; should impose, as well as levy, fines and amercements; should one day condemn a man to death, and personally execute him the next. Neither may he act as an ordinary justice of the peace during the time of his office; for this would be equally insensible, he being in many respects the servant of the justices.\n\nIn his ministerial capacity, the sheriff is bound to execute all processes issuing from the king's courts of justice. In the commencement of civil causes, he is to serve the writ, to arrest, and to take bail; when the cause comes to trial, he must summon and return the jury; when it is determined, he must see the judgment of the court carried into execution. In criminal matters, he also arrests and imprisons, he returns the jury, he has the custody of the delinquent, and he executes the sentence of the court, though it extend to death itself.\n\nAs the king's bailiff, it is his business to preserve the rights of the king within his bailiwick; for so his county is frequently called in the writs: a word introduced by the princes of the Norman line; in imitation of the French, whose territory is divided into bailiwicks, as that of England into counties. He must seize to the king's use all lands devolved to the crown by attainer or elsecheat; must levy all fines and forfeitures; must seize and keep all waifs, wrecks, estrays, and the like, unless...\nthey be granted to some subject; and must also collect\nthe king's rents within his bailiwick, if commanded by\nprocess from the exchequer.\n\nTo execute these various offices, the sheriff has under\nhim many inferior officers; an under-sheriff, bailiffs, and\ngaolers, who must neither buy, sell, nor farm their offices,\non forfeiture of £50l.\n\nThe under-sheriff usually performs all the duties of\nthe office; a very few only excepted, where the per-\nsonal presence of the high sheriff is necessary. But no\nunder-sheriff shall abide in his office above one year;\nand if he does, by statute 23 Hen. VI. c. 8. he for-\nfeits £20l., a very large penalty in those early days. And\nno under-sheriff or sheriff's officer shall practise as an at-\ntorney during the time he continues in such office: for\nthis would be a great inlet to partiality and opprobrium.\nBut these salutary regulations are shamefully evaded, by\npractising in the names of other attorneys, and putting\nin sham deputies by way of nominal under-sheriffs: by\nreason of which, says Dalton, the under-sheriffs and ba-\nlliffs do grow so cunning in their several places, that they\nare able to deceive, and it may well be feared that ma-\nny of them do deceive, both the king, the high sheriff,\nand the county.\n\nSHERIFF, in Scotland. See LAW, Part iii. sect. 3.\n\nSHERLOCK, WILLIAM, a learned English divine\nin the 17th century, was born in 1641, and educated\nat Eton school, where he distinguished himself by the\nvigour of his genius and his application to study. Thence\nhe was removed to Cambridge, where he took his de-\ngrees. In 1669 he became rector of the parish of St\nGeorge, Botolph-lane, in London; and in 1681 was col-\nlated to the prebend of Pancras, in the cathedral of St\nPaul's. He was likewise chosen master of the Temple,\nand had the rectory of Therfield in Hertfordshire. Af-\nter the Revolution he was suspended from his preferment,\nfor refusing the oaths to King William and Queen Ma-\nry; but at last he took them, and publicly justified what\nhe had done. In 1691 he was installed dean of St\nPaul's. His Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity\nengaged him in a warm controversy with Dr South and\nothers. Bishop Burnet tells us, he was \"a clear, a po-\nlite, and a strong writer; but apt to affume too much\nto himself, and to treat his adversaries with contempt.\"\nHe died in 1707. His works are very numerous; a-\nmong these are, 1. A Discourse concerning the Know-\nledge of Jesus Christ, against Dr Owen. 2. Several\npieces against the Papists, the Socinians, and Diffracters.\n3. A practical Treatise on Death, which is much ad-\nmired. 4. A practical Discourse on Providence. 5. A\npractical Discourse on the Future Judgment; and many\nother works.\n\nSHERLOCK, Dr Thomas, bishop of London, was\nthe son of the preceding Dr William Sherlock, and\nwas born in 1678. He was educated in Catharine hall,\nCambridge, where he took his degrees, and of which\nhe became master: he was made master of the Temple\nvery young, on the resignation of his father; and it is\nremarkable, that this mastership was held by father and\nson successively for more than 70 years. He was at\nthe head of the opposition against Dr Hoadley bishop\nof Bangor; during which contest he published a great\nnumber of pieces. He attacked the famous Collins's\n\"Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion,\" in\na course of six sermons, preached at the Temple church,\nwhich he intitled \"The Use and Intent of Prophecy in\nthe several Ages of the World.\" In 1728, Dr Sherlock\nwas promoted to the bishopric of Bangor; and was\ntransplanted to Salisbury in 1734. In 1747 he refused\nthe archbishopric of Canterbury, on account of his ill\nstate of health; but recovering in a good degree, ac-\ncepted the see of London the following year. On oc-\ncasion of the earthquakes in 1750, he published an ex-\ncellent Pastoral Letter to the clergy and inhabitants\nof London and Westminster: of which it is said there\nwere printed in 40,000; in 8vo, 20,000; and in\n12mo, about 30,000; before pirated editions, of which\nnot less than 50,000 were supposed to have been sold.\nUnder the weak state of body in which he lay for several\nyears, he revised and published 4 vols of Sermons in 8vo,\nwhich are particularly admired for their ingenuity and\nelegance. He died in 1762, and by report worth\n£50,000. \"His learning,\" says Dr Nicholls, \"was\nvery extensive: God had given him a great and an un-\nderstanding mind, a quick comprehension, and a solid\njudgment. These advantages of nature he improved by\nmuch industry and application. His skill in the civil\nand canon law was very considerable; to which he had\nadded such a knowledge of the common law of England\nas few clergymen attain to. This it was that gave him\nthat influence in all causes where the church was con-\ncerned; as knowing precisely what it had to claim from\nits constitutions and canons, and what from the com-\nmon law of the land.\" Dr Nicholls then mentions his\nconstant and exemplary piety, his warm and fervent zeal\nin preaching the duties and maintaining the doctrines of\nChristianity, and his large and diffusive munificence and\ncharity; particularly by his having given large sums of\nmoney to the corporation of clergymen's sons, to several\nof the hospitals, and to the society for propagating the\ngospel in foreign parts: also his bequeathing to Catha-\nrine-hall in Cambridge, the place of his education, his\nvaluable library of books, and his donations for the\nfounding a librarian's place and a scholarship, to the a-\nmount of several thousand pounds.\n\nSHERRIFFE, of Mecca, the title of the descen-\ndants of Mahomet by Hafsan b. Ali. These are di-\nvided into several branches, of which the family of Ali\nBunemi, consisting at least of three hundred individuals,\nenjoy the sole right to the throne of Mecca. The Ali\nBunemi are, again, subdivided into two subordinate\nbranches, Darri Sajid, and Darri Barkad; of whom\nsometimes the one, sometimes the other, have given\nsovereigns to Mecca and Medina, when these were sepa-\nrate states.\n\nNot only is the Turkish sultan indifferent about the\norder of succession in this family, but he seems even to\nfoment the dissensions which arise among them, and fa-\nvours the strongest, merely that he may weaken them\nall. As the order of succession is not determinately\nfixed, and the sherriffes may all aspire alike to the so-\nvereign power, this uncertainty of right, aided by the\nintrigues of the Turkish officers, occasions frequent re-\nvolutions. The grand sherriffe is seldom able to main-\ntain himself on the throne; and it still seldom happens\nthat his reign is not disturbed by the revolt of his near-\nest relations. There have been instances of a nephew\nsucceeding his uncle, an uncle succeeding his nephew,\nand sometimes of a person, from a remote branch, coming in the room of the reigning prince of the ancient house.\n\nWhen Niebuhr was in Arabia, in 1763, the reigning Sherriff Mefad had fifteen fourteen years on the throne, and, during all that period, had been continually at war with the neighbouring Arabs, and with his own nearest relations sometimes. A few years before, the pasha of Syria had deposed him, and raised his younger brother to the sovereign dignity in his stead. But after the departure of the caravan, Jafar, the new sherriff, not being able to maintain himself on the throne, was obliged to resign the sovereignty again to Melad. Achmet, the second brother of the sherriffs, who was much beloved by the Arabs, threatened to attack Mecca while Niebuhr was at Jidda. Our traveller was soon after informed of the termination of the quarrel, and of Achmet's return to Mecca, where he continued to live peaceably in a private character.\n\nThese examples show that the Musulmans observe not the law which forbids them to bear arms against their holy places. An Egyptian bey even professed, a few years since, to plant some small cannons within the compass of the Kaaba, upon a small tower, from which he fired over that sacred mansion, upon the palace of Sherriff Mefad, with whom he was at variance.\n\nThe dominions of the sherriffs comprehend the cities of Mecca, Medina, Jambu, Taaff, Sadie, Ghunfude, Hali, and thirteen others less considerable, all situated in Hedjas. Near Taaff is the lofty mountain of Gazvan, which according to Arabian authors, is covered with snow in the midst of summer. As these dominions are neither opulent nor extensive, the revenue of their sovereign cannot be considerable.\n\nHe finds a rich resource, however, in the imposts levied on pilgrims, and in the gratuities offered him by Musulman monarchs. Every pilgrim pays a tax of from ten to an hundred crowns, in proportion to his ability. The Great Mogul remits annually sixty thousand rupees to the sherriffs, by an assignment upon the government of Surat. Indeed, since the English made themselves masters of this city, and the territory belonging to it, the nabob of Surat has no longer been able to pay the sum. The sherriff once demanded it of the English, as the possessors of Surat; and, till they should satisfy him, forbade their captains to leave the port of Jidda. But the English disregarding this prohibition, the sherriff complained to the Ottoman Porte, and they communicated his complaints to the English ambassador. He at the same time opened a negociation with the nominal nabob, who resides in Surat. But all these steps proved fruitless: and the sovereign of Mecca seems not likely to be ever more benefited by the contribution from India.\n\nThe power of the sherriffs extends not to spiritual matters; these are entirely managed by the heads of the clergy, of different sects, who are resident at Mecca. Rigid Musulmans, such as the Turks, are not very favourable in their sentiments of the sherriffs, but suspect their orthodoxy, and look upon them as secretly attached to the tolerant sect of the Zeidi.\n\nSHETLAND, the name of certain islands belonging to Scotland, and lying to the northward of Orkney. There are many convincing proofs that these islands were very early inhabited by the Picts, or rather by those nations who were the original possessors of the Orkneys; and at the time of the total destruction of these nations, if any credit be due to tradition, their woods were entirely ruined (a). It is highly probable that the people in Shetland, as well as in the Orkneys, flourished under their own princes dependent upon the crown of Norway; yet this seems to have been rather through what they acquired by fishing and commerce, than by the cultivation of their lands. It may also be reasonably presumed, that they grew thinner of inhabitants after they were annexed to the crown of Scotland; and it is likely that they revived again, chiefly by the very great and extensive improvements which the Dutch made in the herring fishery upon their coasts, and the trade that the crews of their buffes, then very numerous, carried on with the inhabitants, necessarily resulting from their want of provisions and other conveniences.\n\nThere are many reasons which may be assigned why these islands, though part of our dominions, have not hitherto been better known to us. They were commonly placed two degrees too far to the north in all the old maps, in order to make them agree with Ptolemy's description of Thule, which he asserted to be in the latitude of 63 degrees; which we find urged by Camden as a reason why Thule must be one of the Shetland isles, to which speed also agrees, though from their being thus wrong placed he could not find room for them in his maps. Another, and that no light cause, was the many false, fabulous, and impertinent relations published concerning them (b), as if they were countries inhospitable and uninhabitable; and lastly, the indolence, or rather indifference, of the natives, who, contenting themselves with those necessaries and conveniences procured by their intercourse with other nations, and conceiving themselves neglected by the mother country, have seldom troubled her with their applications.\n\nThere are few countries that have gone by more names than these islands; they were called in Icelandic, Hialflandia, from hialt, the \"hilt of a sword;\" this might be possibly corrupted into Hetland, Hitland, or Heiland, though some tell us this signifies a \"high land.\" They have been likewise, and are still in some maps, called Zeeland and Zealand, in reference, as has been supposed, to their situation. By the Danes, and by\n\n(a) The tradition is, that this was done by the Scots when they destroyed the Picts; but is more probably referred to the Norwegians rooting out the original possessors of Shetland.\n\n(b) They represented the climate as intensely cold; the soil as composed of crags and quagmire, so barren as to be incapable of bearing corn; to supply which, the people, after drying fish-bones, powdered them, then kneaded and baked them for bread. The larger fish-bones were said to be all the fuel they had. Yet, in so dreary a country, and in such miserable circumstances, they were acknowledged to be very long-lived, cheerful, and contented.\nShetland, by the natives, they are styled Yealtaland; and notwithstanding the oddness of the orthography, this differs very little, if at all, from their manner of pronouncing Zetland, out of which pronunciation grew the modern names of Shetland and Scotland.\n\nThe islands of Shetland, as we commonly call them, are well situated for trade. The nearest continent to them is Norway; the port of Bergen lying 44 leagues east, whereas they lie 46 leagues north-north-east from Buchanels; east-north-east from Sanda, one of the Orkneys, about 16 or 18 leagues; five or seven leagues north-east from Fair Isle; 58 leagues east from the Ferroc illes; and at nearly the same distance north-east from Lewis. The southern promontory of the Mainland, called Sumburgh Head, lies in 59 degrees and 59 minutes of north latitude; and the northern extremity of Unst, the most remote of them all, in the latitude of 61 degrees 15 minutes. The meridian of London passes through this last island, which lies about 2 degrees 30 minutes west from Paris, and about 5 degrees 15 minutes east from the meridian of Cape Lizard. According to Gifford's Historical Description of Zetland, the inhabited islands are 33, of which the principal is styled Mainland, and extends in length from north to south about 60 miles, and is in some places 20 broad, though in others not more than two.\n\nIt is impossible to speak with precision; but, according to the best computation which we have been able to form, the Shetland islands contain near three times as much land as the Orkneys; and they are considered as not inferior to the provinces of Utrecht, Zeeland, and all the rest of the Dutch islands taken together; but of climate and soil they have not much to boast. The longest day in the island of Unst is 19 hours 15 minutes, and of consequence the shortest day 4 hours and 45 minutes. The spring is very late, the summer very short; the autumn also is of no long duration, dark, foggy, and rainy; the winter sets in about November, and lasts till April, and sometimes till May. They have frequently in that season storms of thunder, much rain, but little frost or snow. High winds are indeed very frequent and very troublesome, yet they seldom produce any terrible effects. The aurora borealis is as common here as in any of the northern countries. In the winter season the sea swells and rages in such a manner, that for five or six months their ports are inaccessible, and of course the people during that space have no correspondence with the rest of the world.\n\nThe soil in the interior part of the Mainland, for the most part, is mountainous, mossy, and boggy, yet not to such a degree as to render the country utterly impalpable; for many of the roads here, and in some of the northern islands, are as good as any other natural roads, and the people travel them frequently on all occasions. Near the coast there are sometimes for miles together flat pleasant spots, very fertile both in pasture and corn. The mountains produce large crops of very nutritive grasses in the summer; and they cut considerable quantities of hay, with which they feed their cattle in the winter. They might with a little attention bring more of their country into cultivation: but the people are so much addicted to their fishery, and feel so little necessity of having recourse to this method for subsistence, that they are content, how strangesoever that may seem to us, to let four parts in five of their land remain in a state of nature.\n\nThey want not considerable quantities of marl in different islands, though they use but little; hitherto there has been no chalk found; limestone and freestone there are in the southern parts of the Mainland in great quantities, and also in the neighbouring islands, particularly Fetlar; and considerable quantities of flate, very good in its kind. No mines have been hitherto wrought to any great extent; but there are in many places appearances of metallic ores, as those of copper and iron; and it is said, pieces of silver ore have been found. In some of the smaller islands there are strong appearances of iron; but, through the want of proper experiments being made, there is, in this respect at least, hitherto nothing certain. Their meadows are inclosed with dikes, and produce very good grass. The little corn they grow is chiefly barley, with some oats; though even in the northern extremity of Unst the little land which they have is remarkable for its fertility. The hills abound with medicinal herbs; and their kitchen-gardens thrive as well, and produce as good greens and roots, as any in Britain. Of late years, and since this has been attended to, some gentlemen have had even greater success than they expected in the cultivating of tulips, roses, and many other flowers. They have no trees, and hardly any shrubs except juniper, yet they have a tradition that their country was formerly overgrown with woods; and it seems to be a confirmation of this, that the roots of timber-trees have been, and are still, dug up at a great depth; and that in some, and those too inaccessible places, the mountain-ash is still found growing wild. That this defect, viz., the want of wood at present, does not arise entirely from the soil or climate, appears from several late experiments; some gentlemen having raised ash, maple, horse-chestnut, &c., in their gardens. Though the inhabitants are without either wood or coals, they are very well supplied with fuel, having great plenty of heath and peat. The black cattle in this country are in general of a larger sort than in Orkney, which is owing to their having more extensive pastures; a clear proof that still farther improvements might be made in respect to size. Their horses are small, but strong, stout, and well-shaped, live very hardy, and to a great age. They have likewise a breed of small swine, the flesh of which, when fat, is esteemed very delicious. They have no goats, hares, or foxes; and in general no wild or venomous creatures of any kind except rats in some few islands. They have no moorfowl, which is the more remarkable, as there are everywhere immense quantities of heath; but there are many sorts of wild and water-fowl, particularly the dunter-goose, clack-goose, folan-goose, swans, ducks, teal, whaps, foists, lyres, kittiwakes, maws, plovers, cormorants, &c. There is likewise the ember-goose, which is said to hatch her egg under her wing. Eagles and hawks, as also ravens, crows, mews, &c., abound here.\n\nAll these islands are well watered; for there are everywhere excellent springs, some of them mineral and medicinal. They have indeed no rivers; but many pleasant rills or rivulets, of different sizes; in some of the largest they have admirable trouts, some of which are of 7½ and even of 20 pounds weight. They have likewise\nShetland, likewise many fresh-water lakes, well stored with trout and eels, and in most of them there are also large and fine flounders; in some very excellent cod. These fresh-water lakes, if the country was better peopled, and the common people more at their ease, are certainly capable of great improvements. The sea-coasts of the Main-land of Shetland, in a straight line, are 55 leagues; and therefore there cannot be a country conceived more proper for establishing an extensive fishery. What the inhabitants have been hitherto able to do, their natural advantages considered, does not deserve that name, notwithstanding they export large quantities of cod, tusk, ling, and skate, inasmuch that the bounty allowed by acts of parliament amounts from 14,000l. to 20,000l. annually. They have, besides, haddock, whitings, turbot, and a variety of other fish. In many of the inlets there are prodigious quantities of excellent oysters, lobsters, mussels, cockles, and other shell-fish. As to amphibious creatures, they have multitudes of otters and seals; add to these, that amber, ambergris, and other spoils of the ocean, are sometimes found upon the coasts.\n\nThe inhabitants are a stout, well-made, comely people; the lower sort of a frowardly complexion. The gentry are allowed, by all who have conversed with them, to be most of them polite, shrewd, sensible, lively, active, and intelligent persons; and these, to the number of 100 families, have very handsome, strong, well-built houses, neatly furnished; their tables well served; polished in their manners, and exceedingly hospitable and civil to strangers. Those of an inferior rank are a hardy, robust, and laborious people, who, generally speaking, get their bread by fishing in all weathers in their yawls, which are little bigger than Graveend wherries; live hardly, and in the summer season mostly on fish; their drink, which, in reference to the British dominions, is peculiar to the country, is called hand, and is a sort of butter-milk, long kept, and very sour. Many live to great ages, though not so long as in former times. In respect, however, to the bulk of the inhabitants, from the poorness of living, from the nature of it, and from the drinking great quantities of corn-spirits of the very worst sort, multitudes are afflicted with an inveterate fever; from which those in better circumstances are entirely free, and enjoy as good health as in any other country in Europe. As they have no great turn to agriculture, and are persuaded that their country is not fit for it, they do not (though probably they might) raise corn enough to support them for more than two-thirds of the year. But they are much more successful in their pasture-grounds, which are kept well inclosed, in good order, and, together with their commons, supply them plentifully with beef and mutton. They pay their rents generally in butter at Lammas, and in money at Martinmas. As to manufactures, they make a strong coarse cloth for their own use, as also linen. They make likewise of their own wool very fine stockings. They export, besides the different kinds of fish already mentioned, some herrings, a considerable quantity of butter and train-oil, otter and seal skins, and no inconsiderable quantity of the fine stockings just mentioned. Their chief trade is to Leith, London, Hamburgh, Spain, and to the Straits. They import timbers, deals, and some of their best oats, from Norway; corn and flour from the Orkneys, and from North Brit-\n\ntain; spirits and some other things from Hamburgh; Shetland cloths and better sort of linen from Leith; grocery, household furniture, and other necessaries, from London. The superior-duties to the earl of Morton are generally let in farm; and are paid by the people in butter, oil, and money. The remains of the old Norwegian constitution are still visible in the division of their lands; and they have some udalmen or freeholders amongst them. But the Scots laws, customs, manners, dress, and language, prevail; and they have a sheriff, and other magistrates for the administration of justice, as well as a cuthomhouse, with a proper number of officers. In reference to their ecclesiastical concerns, they have a presbytery, 12 ministers, and an itinerant for Foula, Fair Island, and the Skerries. Each of these ministers has a stipend of between 40 and 50 pounds, besides a house and a glebe free from taxes. The number of souls in these islands may be about 20,000.\n\nSHEW-BREAD, the loaves of bread which the priest of the week put every Sabbath-day upon the golden-table in the sanctuary, before the Lord, in the temple of the Jews. They were twelve in number, and were offered to God in the name of the twelve tribes of Israel. They were shaped like a brick, were ten palms long and five broad, weighing about eight pounds each. They were unleavened, and made of fine flour by the Levites. The priests set them on the table in two rows, six in a row; and put frankincense upon them to preserve them from moulding. They were changed every Sabbath, and the old ones belonged to the priest upon duty. Of this bread none but the priests might eat, except in cases of necessity. It was called the Bread of faces, because the table of the show-bread, being almost over-against the ark of the covenant, the loaves might be said to be set before the face of God. The original table was carried away to Babylon, but a new one was made for the second temple. It was of wood overlaid with gold. This, with the candlestick and some other spoils, was carried by Titus to Rome.\n\nSHIELD, an ancient weapon of defence, in form of a light buckler, borne on the arm to fend off lances, darts, &c. The form of the shield is represented by the escutcheon in coats of arms. The shield was that part of the ancient armour on which the persons of distinction in the field of battle always had their arms painted; and most of the words used at this time to express the space that holds the arms of families are derived from the Latin name for a shield, scutum. The French escu and escussion, and the English word escutcheon, or, as we commonly speak it, escutcheon, are evidently from this origin; and the Italian scudo signifies both the shield of arms and that used in war. The Latin name clipeus, for the same thing, seems also to be derived from the Greek word χρυσος, to engrave; and it had this name from the several figures engraved on it, as marks of distinction of the person who wore it.\n\nThe shield in war, among the Greeks and Romans, was not only useful in the defence of the body, but it was also a token, or badge of honour, to the wearer; and he who returned from battle without it was always treated with infamy afterwards. People have at all times thought this honourable piece of the armour the properest place to engrave, or figure on the signs of dignity of the possessor of it; and hence, when arms came to be painted for families in aftertimes, the heralds al-\nways chose to represent them upon the figure of a shield, but with several exterior additions and ornaments; as the helmet, supporters, and the rest.\n\nThe form of the shield has not only been found different in various nations, but even the people of the same nation, at different times, have varied its form extremely; and among several people there have been shields of several forms and sizes in use, at the same period of time, and suited to different occasions. The most ancient and universal form of shields, in the earlier ages, seems to have been the triangular. This we see instances of in all the monuments and gems of antiquity: our own most early monuments show it to have been the most antique shape also with us, and the heralds have found it the most convenient for their purposes, when they had any odd number of figures to represent; as if three, then two in the broad bottom part, and one in the narrow upper end, it held them very well; or if five, they stood as conveniently, as three below, and two above. The other form of a shield, now universally used, is square, rounded and pointed at the bottom: this is taken from the figure of the Samnite shield used by the Romans, and since copied very generally by the English, French, and Germans.\n\nThe Spaniards and Portuguese have the like general form of shields, but they are round at the bottom without the point; and the Germans, beside the Samnite-shield, have two others pretty much in use: these are, 1. The bulging shield, distinguished by its swelling or bulging out at the flanks; and, 2. The indented shield, or shield chancery, which has a number of notches and indentings all round its sides. The use of the ancient shield of this form was, that the notches served to rest the lance upon, that it might be firm while it gave the thrust; but this form being less proper for the receiving armorial figures, the two former have been much more used in the heraldry of that nation.\n\nBesides this different form of the shields in heraldry, we find them also often distinguished by their different positions, some of them standing erect, and others slanting various ways, and in different degrees; this the heralds express by the word pendant, \"hanging,\" they seeming to be hung up not by the centre, but by the right or left corner. The French call these ecu pendant, and the common antique triangular ones ecu ancien. The Italians call this fusto pendente; and the reason given for exhibiting the shield in these figures in heraldry is, that in the ancient tilts and tournaments, they who were to joust at these military exercises, were obliged to hang up their shields with their armories, or coats of arms on them, out at the windows and balconies of the houses near the place; or upon trees, pavilions, or the barriers of the ground, if the exercise was to be performed in the field.\n\nThose who were to fight on foot, according to Columbier, had their shields hung up by the right corner, and those who were to fight on horseback had theirs hung up by the left. This position of the shields in heraldry is called couche by some writers, though by the generality pendant.\n\nIt was very frequent in all parts of Europe, in arms given between the 11th and 14th centuries; but it is to be observed, that the hanging by the left corner, as it was the token of the owner's being to fight on horseback, so it was esteemed the most honourable and noble situation; and all the pendant shields of the sons of the royal family of Scotland and England, and of our nobility at that time, are thus hanging from the left corner. The hanging from this corner was a token of the owner's being of noble birth, and having fought in the tournaments before; but no sovereign ever had a shield pendant any way, but always erect, as they never formally entered the lists of the tournament.\n\nThe Italians generally have their shields of arms of an oval form; this seems to be done in imitation of the Pope's and other dignified clergy: but their herald Pietro Sancho seems to regret the use of this figure of the shield, as an innovation brought in by the painters and engravers as most convenient for holding the figures, but derogatory to the honour of the possessor, as not representing either antiquity or honours won in war, but rather the honours of some citizen or person of learning. Some have carried it so far as to say, that those who either have no ancient title to nobility, or have fulfilled it by any unworthy action, cannot any longer wear their arms in shields properly figured, but were obliged to have them painted in an oval or round shield.\n\nIn Flanders, where this author lived, the round and oval shields are in the dispute he speaks of; but in Italy, beside the popes and dignified prelates, many of the first families of the laity have them.\n\nThe secular princes, in many other countries, also retain this form of the shield, as the most ancient and truly expressive of the Roman clypeus.\n\nShield, in Heraldry, the escutcheon or field on which the bearings of coats of arms are placed. See Heraldry.\n\nSHIELDRAKE, or SHELDRAKE. See ANAS, Ornithology Index.\n\nSHIELDS, North and South, two sea-port towns, at the mouth of the Tyne, the one in Northumberland, the other in the county of Durham. South Shields contained above 200 salt-pans, 50 years ago; but now there are not more than five or six; and the duty, which is now only 10,000l. per annum, amounted formerly to 80,000l. South Shields has a considerable trade, in which not less than 500 vessels from 100 to 500 tons burden are employed; and has nine dry docks for repairing, and 10 yards for building ships. This town has been much improved of late years. In the centre there is a large square, in which there is a handsome town-hall, with a colonnade under it for the weekly market, and from which streets branch out on all sides. North Shields contains also some fine streets and squares. The harbour is very commodious, and so spacious, that it is capable of receiving 2000 ships. It is defended by a fort, in which there is also a lighthouse, corresponding with another on the top of the bank, to direct vessels into the harbour. The population of North and South Shields is estimated at 25,000. W. Long. 1. 12. N. Lat. 55. 44.\n\nSHIFTERS, on board a man of war, certain men who are employed by the cooks to shift and change the water in which the flesh or fish is put, and laid for some time, in order to fit it for the kettle.\n\nSHIFTING A TACKLE, in sea-language, the act of removing the blocks of a tackle to a greater distance from each other, on the object to which they are applied, in order to give a greater scope or extent to their purchase. This operation is otherwise called fleeting. Shifting the helm denotes the alteration of its position,\nShilling, by pushing it towards the opposite side of the ship.\n\nShifting the royal, signifies changing its position on the capstan, from the right to the left, and vice versa.\n\nSHILLING, an English silver coin, equal to twelve pence, or the twentieth part of a pound.\n\nFreherus derives the Saxon *feilding*, whence our shilling, from a corruption of *filigra*; proving the derivation by several texts of law, and, among others, by the 26th law, *De annuis legatis*. Skinner deduces it from the Saxon *scild*, \"shield,\" by reason of the escutcheon of arms thereon.\n\nBishop Hooper derives it from the Arabic *scheele*, signifying a weight; but others, with greater probability, deduce it from the Latin *sicilicus*, which signified in that language a quarter of an ounce, or the 48th part of a Roman pound. In confirmation of this etymology it is alleged, that the shilling kept its original signification, and bore the same proportion to the Saxon pound as sicilicus did to the Roman and the Greek, being exactly the 48th part of the Saxon pound; a discovery which we owe to Mr Lambarde.\n\nHowever, the Saxon laws reckon the pound in the round number at 50 shillings, but they really coined out of it only 48; the value of the shilling was five pence; but it was reduced to fourpence above a century before the conquest; for several of the Saxon laws, made in Athelstan's reign, oblige us to take this estimate. Thus it continued to the Norman times, as one of the Conqueror's laws sufficiently affirms; and it seems to have been the common coin by which the English payments were adjusted. After the conquest, the French *solidus* of twopence, which was in use among the Normans, was called by the English name of shilling; and the Saxon shilling of fourpence took a Norman name, and was called the *groat*, or great coin, because it was the largest English coin then known in England.\n\nIt has been the opinion of the bishops Fleetwood and Gibbon, and of the antiquaries in general, that, though the method of reckoning by pounds, marks, and shillings, as well as by pence and farthings, had been in constant use even from the Saxon times, long before the Norman conquest, there never was such a coin in England as either a pound or a mark, nor any shilling, till the year 1304 or 1305; when a few silver shillings or twopences were coined, which have long since been solely confined to the cabinets of collectors.\n\nMr Clarke combats this opinion, alleging that some coins mentioned by Mr Folkes, under Edward I., were probably Saxon shillings new minted, and that Archbishop Aelfric expressly says, that the Saxons had three names for their money, viz. mancuses, shillings, and pennies. He also urges the different value of the Saxon shilling at different times, and its uniform proportion to the pound, as an argument that their shilling was a coin; and the testimony of the Saxon gospels, in which the word we have translated pieces of silver is rendered *shillings*, which, he says, they would hardly have done, if there had been no such coin as a shilling then in use. Accordingly the Saxons expressed their shilling in Latin by *siclus* and *argentum*. He further adds, that the Saxon shilling was never expressed by *solidus* till after the Norman settlements in England; and howsoever it altered during the long period that elapsed from the conquest to the time of Henry VII., it was the most constant denomination of money in all payments, though it was then only a species of account, or the twentieth part of the pound sterling; and when it was again revived as a coin, it lessened gradually as the pound sterling lessened, from the 28th of Edward III. to the 43rd of Elizabeth.\n\nIn the year 1560 there was a peculiar sort of shilling struck in Ireland, of the value of nine pence English, which passed in Ireland for twopence. The motto on the reverse was, *posui Deum adiutorem meum*. Eighty-two of these shillings, according to Malynes, went to the pound; they therefore weighed 20 grains, one-fourth each, which is somewhat heavier in proportion than the English shilling of that time, 62 whereof went to the pound, each weighing 92 grains seven-eighths; and the Irish shilling being valued at the Tower at nine pence English, that is, one-fourth part less than the English shilling, it should therefore proportionably weigh one-fourth part less, and its full weight be somewhat more than 62 grains; but some of them found at this time, though much worn, weighed 69 grains. In the year 1598, five different pieces of money of this kind were struck in England for the service of the kingdom of Ireland. These were shillings to be current in Ireland at twopence each; half shillings to be current at sixpence, and quarter shillings at threepence. Pennies and halfpennies were also struck of the same kind, and sent over for the payment of the army in Ireland. The money thus coined was of a very base mixture of copper and silver; and two years after there were more pieces of the same kinds struck for the same service, which were still worse; the former being three ounces of silver to nine ounces of copper; and these latter only two ounces eighteen pennyweights to nine ounces two pennyweights of the alloy.\n\nThe Dutch, Flemish, and Germans, have likewise their shilling, called *schelin*, *schilling*, *scalin*, &c. but these not being of the same weight or fineness with the English shilling, are not current at the same value. The English shilling is worth about 23 French sols; those of Holland and Germany about 11 sols and a half; those of Flanders about nine. The Dutch shillings are also called *sols de gros*, because equal to twelve gros. The Danes have copper shillings worth about one-fourth of a farthing sterling.\n\nSHILLUK, a town in Africa on the banks of the true Nile. The houses are built of clay, and the clothing of the inhabitants consists of long gowns, which they pass round the waist and between the thighs. They are all black, and both sexes shave their heads. These people have the dominion of the river, and exact toll of all passengers. The meaning of the word Shilluk seems to be unknown. When they transport Mahometans across the ferry, they sometimes show the importance which their situation gives them. After the Mahometan has placed himself in the boat, they ask him, who is the master of that river? The other replies Ulloh or Rubaric, God is the master of it. No, you must say that such a one (naming his chief) is the master of it, or you shall not pass. They are said to be hospitable to such as come among them in a peaceable manner, and as never betraying those to whom they have once afforded protection. The particulars of their worship have not been described. Shilluk, according to Mr Browne's map, is in 13° N. Lat. 32° 26' E. Long.\nShiloh.\n\nSHILOH, is a term famous among interpreters and commentators upon Scripture. It is found (Gen. xlii. 10.) to denote the Messiah. The patriarch Jacob foretells his coming in these words; \"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.\" The Hebrew text reads, נָשׁוּב אֶל־עֵדִי וְנַעֲנֵי שִׁלֹה כִּימֵי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ, \"until Shiloh come.\" All Christian commentators agree, that this word ought to be understood of the Messiah, or Jesus Christ; but all are not agreed about its literal and grammatical signification. St Jerome, who translates it by Qui mittendus est, manifestly reads Shilonach \"sent,\" instead of Shiloh. The Septuagint have it Εἰς ἐκεῖνον τὸ ἀποστατικόν ἡμῶν; or, Εἰς ἐκεῖνον τὸ ἀποστατικόν ἡμῶν, (as if they had read ἐκεῖνον ἡμῶν), i.e. \"Until the coming of him to whom it is referred;\" or, \"Till we see arrive that which is referred for him.\"\n\nIt must be owned, that the signification of the Hebrew word Shiloh is not well known. Some translate; \"the sceptre shall not depart from Judah, till he comes to whom it belongs;\" נָשׁוּב אֶל־עֵדִי וְנַעֲנֵי שִׁלֹה. Others, \"till the coming of the peace-maker;\" or, \"the pacific;\" or, \"of prosperity;\" נָשׁוּב אֶל־עֵדִי וְנַעֲנֵי שִׁלֹה. Shiloh signifies, \"to be in peace, to be in prosperity;\" others, \"till the birth of him who shall be born of a woman, that shall conceive without the knowledge of a man,\" נָשׁוּב אֶל־עֵדִי וְנַעֲנֵי שִׁלֹה. Some Rabbins have taken the name Shiloh or Shiloh, as if it signified the city of this name in Palestine: \"The sceptre shall not be taken away from Judah till it comes to Shiloh; till it shall be taken from him to be given to Saul at Shiloh.\" But in what part of Scripture it is said, that Saul was acknowledged as king or consecrated at Shiloh? If we would understand it of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the matter is still as uncertain. The Scripture mentions no assembly at Shiloh that admitted him as king. A more modern author derives Shiloh from נָשׁוּב אֶל־עֵדִי וְנַעֲנֵי שִׁלֹה, which sometimes signifies to be weary, to suffer; \"till his labours, his sufferings, his passion, shall happen.\"\n\nBut not to amuse ourselves about seeking out the grammatical signification of Shiloh, it is sufficient for us to know, that the ancient Jews are in this matter agreed with the Christians: they acknowledge, that this word stands for the Messiah the King. It is thus that the paraphraists Onkelos and Jonathan, that the ancient Hebrew commentaries upon Genesis, and that the Talmudists themselves, explain it. If Jesus Christ and his apostles did not make use of this passage to prove the coming of the Messiah, it was because then the completion of this prophecy was not sufficiently manifest. The sceptre still continued among the Jews; they had still kings of their own nation in the persons of the Herods; but soon after the sceptre was entirely taken away from them, and has never been restored to them since.\n\nThe Jews seek in vain to put forced meanings upon this prophecy of Jacob; saying, for example, that the sceptre intimates the dominion of strangers, to which they have been in subjection, or the hope of seeing one day the sceptre or supreme power settled again among themselves. It is easy to perceive, that all this is contrived to deliver themselves out of perplexity. In vain likewise they take refuge in certain princes of the captivity, whom they pretend to have substituted beyond the Euphrates, exercising an authority over their nation little differing from absolute, and being of the race of David. This pretended succession of princes is perfectly chimerical; and though at certain times they could show a succession, it continued but a short time, and their authority was too obscure, and too much limited, to be the object of a prophecy so remarkable as this was.\n\nSHINGLES, in building, small pieces of wood, or quartered oaken boards, fawn to a certain scantling, or, as is more usual, cleft to about an inch thick at one end, and made like wedges, four or five inches broad, and eight or nine inches long.\n\nShingles are used instead of tiles or slates, especially for churches and steeples; however, this covering is dear; yet, where tiles are very scarce, and a light covering is required, it is preferable to thatch; and where they are made of good oak, cleat, and not sawed, and well seasoned in water and the sun, they make a fine, light, and durable covering.\n\nThe building is first to be covered all over with boards, and the shingles nailed upon them.\n\nSHIP, a general name for all large vessels, particularly those equipped with three masts and a bowsprit; the masts being composed of a lowermast, topmast, and top-gallant-mast; each of these being provided with yards, sails, &c. Ships, in general, are either employed for war or merchandise.\n\nSHIPS OF WAR are vessels properly equipped with artillery, ammunition, and all the necessary martial weapons and instruments for attack or defence. They are distinguished from each other by their several ranks or classes, called rates, as follows: Ships of the first rate mount from 100 guns to 110 guns and upwards; second rate, from 90 to 98 guns; third rate, from 64 to 74 guns; fourth rate, from 50 to 60 guns; fifth rate, from 32 to 44 guns; and sixth rate, from 20 to 28 guns. See the article RATE. Vessels carrying less than 20 guns are denominated sloops, cutters, fire-ships and bombes. It has lately been proposed to reduce the number of these rates, which would be a saving to the nation, and also productive of several material advantages.\n\nIn Plate CCCCLXXX. is the representation of a first rate, with rigging, &c., the several parts of which are as follows:\n\nParts of the hull.—Fig. 1.

It would be endless, and at the same time an unnecessary task, to enumerate all the different kinds of vessels with respect to their rigging; and therefore a few only are here taken notice of. Fig. 3, is a ship which would be converted into a bark by stripping the mizen mast of its yards and the sails belonging to them. If each mast, its corresponding topmast and topgallant-mast, instead of being composed of separate pieces of wood, were all of one continued piece, then this vessel with very little alteration would be a polaree.

Thus we say, a cat-built ship, &c.\n\nTo Ship, is either used actively, as to embark any person or put any thing aboard ship: or passively, to receive anything into a ship; as, \"we shipped a heavy sea at three o'clock in the morning.\"\n\nTo Ship, also implies to fix anything in its place; as, to ship the oars, that is, to put them in their rowlocks; to ship the swivel guns, is to fix them in their sockets; to ship the handspikes, &c.\n\nMachine for drawing Bolts out of Ships, an instrument invented by Mr William Hill for this purpose. His account of which is as follows*.\n\nFirst, The use of this machine is to draw the kelson and dead wood bolts out, and to draw the knee of the head bolts.—Secondly, The heads of the kelson bolts heretofore were all obliged to be driven through the keel. Fon, floor-timbers, and keel, to get them out; by this sec. vol. xi, means the kelson is often entirely destroyed, and the large hole the head makes materially wounds the floors; and frequently, when the bolt is much corroded, it cracks, and the bolt comes out of the side of the keel.—Thirdly, The dead-wood bolts that are driven with two or three drifts, are seldom or never got out, by which means the dead-wood is condemned, when some of it is really serviceable.—Fourthly, In drawing the knee of the head-bolts, sometimes the knee flares off, and cannot be got again, but furs up, and with this machine may be drawn in; for it has been proved to have more power in starting a bolt than the maul.\n\nIn fig. 1, \"A, A, represent two strong male screws, working in female screws near the extremities of the cheeks, against plates of iron E, E. C C is the bolt to be drawn; which, being held between the chaps of the machine at DD, is, by turning the screws by the lever B, forced upwards out of the wood or plank of the ship. F, F, are two dogs, with hooks at their lower extremities; which, being driven into the plank, serve to support the machine till the chaps have got fast hold of the bolt. At the upper part of these dogs are rings passing through holes in a collar, moveable near the heads of the screws. Fig. 2, is a view of the upper side of the cheeks when joined together; a, a, the holes in which the screws work; b, the chaps by which the bolts are drawn. Fig. 3. The under side of the cheek: a, a, the holes in which the screws work; b, the chaps by which the bolts are drawn, and where the teeth that grip the bolt are more distinctly shown. Fig. 4. One of the cheeks separated from the other, the letters referring as in fig. 2 and 3.\n\nThis machine was tried in his majesty's yard at Deptford, and was found of the greatest utility.—\"First, it drew a bolt that was driven down so tight as only to go one\none inch in sixteen blows with a double headed maul, and was well clenched below: the bolt drew the ring a considerable way into the wood, and wire drew itself through, and left the ring behind. Secondly, it drew a bolt out of the Venus's dead wood that could not be got out by the maul. That part of it which went through the keel was bent close up to the lower part of the deadwood, and the machine drew the bolt straight, and drew it out with ease. It also drew a kelson bolt out of the Stanley West Indiaman, in Messrs Well's yard, Deptford; which being a bolt of two drifts, could not be driven out.\n\nManagement of Ships at single anchor, is the method of taking care of a ship while riding at single anchor in a tide-way, by preventing her from fouling her anchor, &c. The following rules for this purpose, with which we have been favoured by Henry Taylor* of North Shields, will be found of the utmost consequence.\n\nRiding in a tide-way, with a fresh-of-wind, the ship should have what is called a short or windward service, say 45 or 50 fathoms of cable, and always threered to windward (A), not always with the helm hard down, but more or less according to the strength or weakness of the tide. It is a known fact, that many ships sheer their anchors home, drive on board of other ships, and on the sands near which they rode, before it has been discovered that the anchor had been moved from the place where it was let go.\n\nWhen the wind is crofs, or nearly crofs, off shore, or in the opposite direction, ships will always back. This is done by the mizen-topmast, affixed, if needful, by the mizen stay-fall; such as have no mizen topsail commonly use the main-topmast, or if it blows fresh, a topgallant-sail, or any such sail at the gaff.\n\nIn backing, a ship should always wind with a taught cable, that it may be certain the anchor is drawn round. In case there is not a sufficiency of wind for that purpose, the ship should be hove about.\n\nRiding with the wind afore the beam, the yards should be braced forward; if abaft the beam, they are to be braced all aback.\n\nIf the wind is so far aft that the ship will not back (which should not be attempted if, when the tide eases, the ship forges ahead, and brings the buoy on the lee quarter), she must be set ahead: if the wind is far aft, and blows fresh, the utmost care and attention is necessary, as ships riding in this situation often break their sheer, and come to windward of their anchors again. It should be observed, that when the ship lies in this ticklish situation, the after-yards must be braced forward, and the fore-yards the contrary way: she will lay safe, as the buoy can be kept on the lee quarter, or suppose the helm is aport, as long as the buoy is on the larboard quarter. With the helm thus, and the wind right aft, or nearly so, the starboard main and fore braces should be hauled in. This supposes the main braces to lead forward.\n\nWhen the ship begins to tend to leeward, and the buoy comes on the weather-quarter, the first thing to be done is to brace about the fore-yard; and when the ship must wind comes near the beam, set the fore-stay-fall, and he set a-keep it standing until it shakes; then brace all the head-yards flat forward, especially if it is likely to blow strong.\n\nIf lying in the aforesaid position, and she breaks her sheer, brace about the main-yard immediately; if she manage recovers and brings the buoy on the lee or larboard quarter, when the latter, let the main-yard be again braced about; but if the buoy come to a sheer the other way, by bringing the buoy on the other quarter, change the helm and brace the fore-yard to.\n\nRiding leeward tide with more cable than the wind. When a ward service, and expecting the ship will go to windward of her anchor, begin as soon as the tide eases to and the shorten in the cable. This is often hard work; but it is likewise necessary to be done, otherwise the anchor may be likely to go to fouled by the great length of cable the ship has to draw round; but even if that could be done, the cable would be damaged against the bows or cut-water. It is to be observed, that when a ship rides windward tide the cable should be cackled from the short service towards the anchor, as far as will prevent the bare part touching the ship.\n\nWhen the ship tends to windward and must be set a-head, hoist the fore-stay-fall as soon as it will stand, and when the buoy comes on the lee quarter, haul down the fore-stay-fall, brace to the fore-yard, and put the helm a-lee; for till then the helm must be kept a-weather and the yards full.\n\nWhen the ship rides leeward tide, and the wind in creafes, care should be taken to give her more cable in time, otherwise the anchor may start, and probably it will be troublesome to get her brought up again; and this care is the more necessary when the ship rides in the house of another ship. Previous to giving a long service it is usual to take a weather-bit, that is, a turn of the cable over the windlass end, so that in veering away the ship will be under command. The service ought\n\n(A) It has been thought by some theorists, that ships should be sheered to leeward of their anchors; but experience and the common practice of the best informed seamen are against that opinion: for it is found, that when a ship rides leeward tide and sheered to windward, with the wind two or three points upon the bow, and blowing hard in the interval between the squalls, the sheer will draw her towards the wind's eye; so that when the next squall comes, before she be pressed astern of her anchor, it is probable there will be a jolt again, and the spring which the cable got by the sheer will greatly ease it during the squall.\n\nEvery seaman knows that no ship without a rudder, or the helm left loose, will wear; they always in such situations fly to: this proves that the wind pressing upon the quarter and the helm alee, a ship will be less liable to break her sheer than when the helm is a-weather. Besides, if the helm is a-lee when she breaks her sheer, it will be a-weather when the wind comes on the other quarter, as it ought to be until the either swing to leeward, or bring the buoy on the other quarter. Now if the ship breaks her sheer with the helm a-weather, it throws her head to the wind so suddenly as scarce to give time to brace the yards about, and very probably she will fall over her anchor before the fore-stay-fall can be got up.\nought to be greased, which will prevent its chafing in the hawsers.\n\nIf the gale continues to increase, the topmasts should be struck in time; but the fore yard should seldom, if ever, be lowered down, that in case of parting the foresail may be ready to be set. At such times there should be more on deck than the common anchor-watch, that no accident may happen from inattention or falling asleep.\n\nIn a tide-way a second anchor should never be let go but when absolutely necessary; for a ship will sometimes ride easier and safer, especially if the sea runs high, with a very long scope of cable and one anchor, than with less length and two cables; however, it is advisable, as a preventive, when ships have not room to drive, and the night is dark, to let fall a second anchor under foot, with a range of cable along the deck. If this is not thought necessary to be done, the deep-sea lead should be thrown overboard, and the line frequently handled by the watch, that they may be assured the rides fast.\n\nIf at any time the anchor-watch, presuming on their own knowledge, should wind the ship, or suffer her to break her sheer without calling the mate, he should immediately, or the very first opportunity, oblige the crew to heave the anchor in sight; which will prevent the commission of the like fault again; for besides the share of trouble the watch will have, the rest of the crew will blame them for neglecting their duty.\n\nPrudent mates seldom lie a week in a road-head without heaving their anchor in sight; even though they have not the least suspicion of its being foul. There are other reasons why the anchor should be looked at; sometimes the cable receives damage by sweeping wrecks or anchors that have been lost, or from rocks or stones; and it is often necessary to trip the anchor, in order to take a clearer birth, which should be done as often as any ship brings up too near.\n\nMethod for the safe removal of such Ships as have been driven on shore. For this purpose empty casks are usually employed to float off the vessel, especially if she is small, and at the same time near the port to which it is proposed to conduct her. In other cases, the following method adopted by Mr Barnard* will answer.\n\n\"On January 1, 1779 (says Mr Barnard), in a most dreadful storm, the York East Indiaman, of eight hundred tons, homeward bound, with a pepper cargo, parted her cables in Margate roads, and was driven on shore, within one hundred feet of the head and thirty feet of the side of Margate pier, then drawing twenty-two feet six inches water, the flow of a good spring tide being only fourteen feet at that place.\n\n\"On the third of the same month I went down, as a ship-builder, to assist, as much as lay in my power, my worthy friend Sir Richard Hotham, to whom the ship belonged. I found her perfectly upright, and her sheer (or side appearance) the same as when first built, but sunk to the twelve feet water-mark fore and aft in a bed of chalk mixed with a stiff blue clay, exactly the shape of her body below that draft of water; and from the rudder being torn from her as she struck coming on shore, and the violent agitation of the sea after her being there, her stern was so greatly injured as to admit free access thereto, which filled her for four days equal to the flow of the tide. Having fully informed myself of her situation and the flow of spring-tides, and being clearly of opinion she might be again got off, I recommended, as the first necessary step, the immediate discharge of the cargo; and, in the progress of that business, I found the tide always flowed to the same height on the ship; and when the cargo was half discharged, and I knew the remaining part should not make her draw more than eighteen feet water, and while I was observing the water at twenty-two feet six inches by the ship's marks, she instantly lifted to seventeen feet eight inches; the water and air being before excluded by her pressure on the clay, and the atmosphere acting upon her upper part equal to five hundred tons, which is the weight of water displaced at the difference of these two drafts of water.\n\n\"The moment the ship lifted, I discovered she had received more damage than was at first apprehended, her leaks being such as filled her from four to eighteen feet water in an hour and a half. As nothing effectual was to be expected from pumping, several scuttles or holes in the ship's side were made, and valves fixed thereto, to draw off the water at the lowest ebb of the tide, to facilitate the discharge of the remaining part of the cargo; and, after many attempts, I succeeded in an external application of sheepskins sewed on a sail and thrust under the bottom, to stop the body of water from rushing so furiously into the ship. This business effected, moderate pumping enabled us to keep the ship to about six feet water at low water, and by a vigorous effort we could bring the ship so light as (when the cargo should be all discharged) to be easily removed into deeper water. But as the external application might be disturbed by so doing, or totally removed by the agitation of the ship, it was absolutely necessary to provide some permanent security for the lives of those who were to navigate her to the river Thames. I then recommended as the cheapest, quickest, and most effectual plan, to lay a deck in the hold, as low as the water could be pumped to, framed so solidly and securely, and caulked so tight, as to swim the ship independent of her own leaky bottom.\n\n\"Beams of fir-timber twelve inches square were placed in the hold under every lower-deck beam in the ship, as low as the water would permit; these were in two pieces, for the convenience of getting them down, and also for the better fixing them of an exact length, and well bolted together when in their places. Over these were laid long Dantzig deals of two inches and a half thick, well nailed and caulked. Against the ship's sides, all fore and aft, was well nailed a piece of fir twelve inches broad and six inches thick on the lower and three inches on the upper edge, to prevent the deck from rising at the side. Over the deck, at every beam, was laid a cross-piece of fir timber six inches deep and twelve inches broad, reaching from the pillar of the hold to the ship's side, on which the shores were to be placed to resist the pressure of the water beneath. On each of these, and against the lower-deck beam, at equal distances from the side and middle of the ship, was placed an upright shore, six inches by twelve, the lower end let two inches into the cross-piece. From the foot of this shore to the ship's side, under the end of every lower-deck beam, was placed a diagonal shore six inches by twelve, to ease the ship's deck of part of the strain by throwing it on the side. An upright shore of three inches by twelve was placed from the end of every cross-piece...\"\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nSHIP-BUILDING, or Naval Architecture, is the art of constructing a ship so as to answer a particular purpose either of war or merchandise.\n\nTo whom the world is indebted for the invention of ships, is, like all other things of equal antiquity, uncertain.\n\nA very small portion of art or contrivance was seen in the first ships: they were neither strong nor durable; but consisted only of a few planks laid together, without beauty or ornament, and just so compacted as to keep out the water. In some places they were only the hulls or stocks of trees hollowed, and then consisted only of one piece of timber. Nor was wood alone applied to this use; but any other buoyant materials, as the Egyptian reed papyrus; or leather, of which the primitive ships were frequently composed; the bottom and sides being extended on a frame of thin battens or scantlings, of flexible wood, or begit with wickers, such as we have frequently beheld amongst the American savages. In this manner they were often navigated upon the rivers of Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sabaeon Arabia, even in latter times. But in the first of them, we find no mention of anything but leather or hides sewed together. In a vessel of this kind, Dardanus secured his retreat to the country afterwards called Troas, when he was compelled by a terrible deluge to forsake his former habitation of Samothrace. According to Virgil, Charon's infernal boat was of the same composition.\n\nBut as the other arts extended their influence, naval architecture likewise began to emerge from the gloom of ignorance and barbarism; and as the ships of those ages were increased in bulk, and better proportioned for commerce, the appearance of the floating citadels of unusual form, full of living men, flying with seemingly expanded wings over the surface of the untraveller ocean, struck the ignorant people with terror and astonishment: and hence, as we are told by Aritophanes, arose the fable of Perseus flying to the Gorgons, who was actually carried thither in a ship! Hence, in all probability, the famous story of Triptolemus riding on a winged dragon is deduced, only because he failed from Athens, in the time of great dearth, to a more plentiful country, to supply the necessities of his people. The fiction of the flying horse Pegasus may be joined with these, who, as several mythologists report, was nothing but a ship with sails, and thence said to be the offspring of Neptune the sovereign of the sea; nor does there appear any other foundation for the stories of griffins, or of ships transformed into birds and fishes, which we often meet with in the ancient poets. So acceptable to the first ages of the world were inventions of this nature, that whoever made any improvements in navigation or naval architecture, building new ships better fitted for strength or swiftness than those used before, or rendered the old more commodious by additional contrivances, or discovered countries unknown to former travellers, were thought worthy of the greatest honours, and often associated into the number of their deified heroes. Hence we have in astronomy the signs of Aries and Taurus, which were no other than two ships: the former transported Phryxus from Greece to Colchis, and the latter Europa from Phoenicia to Crete. Argo, Pegasus, and Perseus, were likewise new ships of a different sort from the former, which being greatly admired by the barbarous and uninstructed people of those times, were translated amongst the stars, in commemoration of their inventors, and metamorphosed into constellations by the poets of their own and of succeeding ages.\n\nThe chief parts, of which ships anciently consisted, were three, viz. the belly, the prow, and the stern: these were again composed of other smaller parts, which shall be briefly described in their order. In the description, we chiefly follow Scheffer, who has so copiously treated this subject, and with such industry and learning collected whatever is necessary to illustrate it, that very little room is left for enlargement by those who incline to pursue this investigation.\n\n1. In the belly, or middle part of the ship, there was ἀγκών, carina, or the \"keel,\" which was composed of wood: it was placed at the bottom of the ship, being designed to cut and glide through the waves, and therefore was not broad, but narrow and sharp; whence it may be perceived that not all ships, but only the ἀγκών, which ships of war were called, whose bellies were straight, and of a small circumference, were provided with keels, the rest having usually flat bottoms. Around the outside of the keel were fixed pieces of wood, to prevent it from being damaged when the ship was first launched into the water, or afterwards struck on any rocks; these were called καρυκεύματα, in Latin cunei.\n\nNext to the keel was φάλαξ, the \"pump well, or well-room,\" within which was contained the αὐτόλιον, or \"pump,\" through which water was conveyed out of the ship.\n\nAfter this, there was διατρίβη τοῦ ἀγκώνος, or the \"second keel,\" somewhat resembling what is now called kel-son; it was placed beneath the pump, and called ασπίδων, ξελάχιον καρυκεύματος; by some it is falsely supposed to be the same with φάλαξ.\n\nAbove the pump was an hollow place, called by Herodotus πολὺ τὸ μέσον, by Pollux νῶτος, and γαστήρ, because large and capacious, after the form of a belly; by the Latins reticulum. This was formed by crooked ribs, with which it was surrounded, which were pieces of wood rising from the keel upwards, and called by Hesychius\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThe belly of the ship being contained within them: in Latin, *coffin*; and in English, *timbers*. Upon these were placed certain planks, which Aristophanes calls *sternboards*, or *sternboards*.\n\nThe *sternboards*, *lateral*, or \"sides\" of the ship, encompassed all the former parts on both hands; these were composed of large rafters extended from prow to stern, and called *sternboards*, and *sternboards*, because by them the whole fabric was begirt or surrounded.\n\nIn both these sides the rowers had their places, called *tunics* and *sternboards*, in Latin *fori* and *traystra*, placed above one another; the lowest was called *sternboards*, and those that laboured therein *sternboards*; the middle, *sternboards*, and the men *sternboards*; the uppermost *sternboards*, whence the rowers were termed *sternboards*. In these apartments were spaces through which the rowers put their oars: these were sometimes one continued cavity from one end to the other, called *sternboards*, but more usually distinct holes, each of which was designed for a single oar; these were styled *sternboards*, *sternboards*, as also *sternboards*, because not unlike the eyes of living creatures. All of them were by a more general name termed *sternboards*, from containing the oars; but *sternboards* seems to have been another thing, signifying the spaces between the banks of oars on each side, where the passengers appear to have been placed.\n\nOn the top of all there was a passage or place to walk, called *sternboards*, and *sternboards*, as joining to the *sternboards*, or uppermost bank of oars.\n\n2. *Prow*, the \"prow, or fore deck,\" whence it is sometimes called *sternboards*, and commonly distinguished by other metaphorical titles taken from human faces. In some ships there is mention of two prows, as also two stems; such as Danaus's ship adorned by Minerva when he fled from Egypt. It was usual to beautify the prow with gold and various sorts of paint and colours; in the primitive times red was most in use; whence Homer's ships were generally dignified with the titles of *sternboards*, and *sternboards*, or \"red faced;\" the blue, likewise, or sky-colour, was frequently made use of, as bearing a strict resemblance to the colour of the sea; whence we find ships called by Homer *sternboards*, by Aristophanes *sternboards*. Several other colours were also made use of; nor were they barely varnished over with them, but very often annealed by wax melted in the fire, so that neither the sun, winds, nor water, were able to deface them. The art of doing this was called from the wax *sternboards*, from the fire *sternboards*, which is described by Vitruvius, and mentioned in Ovid.\n\n---\n\n**PiHa coloribus ufitis**\n\n*Ceruleam matrem concavas puppis habet.*\n\nThe painted ship with melted wax anneal'd\n\nHad Tethys for its deity.\n\nIn these colours the various forms of gods, animals, plants, &c. were usually drawn, which were likewise often added as ornaments to other parts of the ships, as plainly appears from the ancient monuments presented to the world by Baylius.\n\nThe sides of the prow were termed *sternboards*, or \"wings,\" and *sternboards*, according to Scheffer, or rather *sternboards*; for since the prow is commonly compared to a human face, it will naturally follow that the sides should be called *cheeks*. These are now called *bows* by our mariners.\n\n3. *Povum*, \"the hind-deck or poop,\" sometimes called *sternboards*, the \"tail,\" because the hindermost part of the ship; it was of a figure more inclining to round than the prow, the extremity of which was sharp, that it might cut the waters; it was also built higher than the prow, and was the place where the pilot sat to steer; the outer-bending part of it was called *sternboards*, answering to our term *quarter*.\n\nThey had various ornaments of sculpture on the prow; as helmets, animals, triumphal wreaths, &c.—The stern was more particularly adorned with wings, shields, &c. Sometimes a little mast was erected whereon to hang ribbands of divers colours, which served instead of a flag to distinguish the ship; and a weather-cock, to signify the part from whence the wind blew.\n\nOn the extremity of the prow was placed a round piece of wood, called the *sternboards*, from its bending; and sometimes *sternboards*, the \"eye\" of the ship, because fixed in the fore-deck; on this was inscribed the name of the ship, which was usually taken from the figure painted on the flag. Hence comes the frequent mention of ships, called *sternboards*, *sternboards*, *sternboards*, &c., which the poets took the liberty to represent as living creatures that transported their riders from one country to another.\n\nThe whole fabric being completed, it was fortified with pitch, and sometimes a mixture of rosin, to secure the wood from the waters; whence it comes that Homer's ships are everywhere mentioned with the epithet of *sternboards*, or \"black.\" Pitch was first used by the inhabitants of Phæacia, since called Corfuca; sometimes wax was employed for the same purpose; whence Ovid,\n\n*Cerulea ceratas accepit unda rates.*\n\nThe azure waves receive the waxed ships.\n\nAfter all, the ship being bedecked with garlands and flowers, the mariners also adorned with crowns, she was launched into the sea with loud acclamations and other expressions of joy; and being purified by a priest with a lighted torch, an egg and brimstone, or after some other manner, was consecrated to the god whose image she bore.\n\nThe ships of war of the ancients were distinguished from other kinds of vessels by various turrets and accretions of building, some to defend their own soldiers, and others to annoy the enemy; and from one another, in latter ages, by several degrees or ranks of oars, the most usual number of which was four or five, which appear not to have been arranged, as some imagine, on the same level in different parts of the ship; nor yet, as others have supposed, directly above one another's heads; but their seats being placed one behind another, ascended gradually, like stairs. Ptolemy Philopater, urged by a vain-glorious desire of exceeding all the world besides in naval architecture, is said to have farther enlarged the number of banks to 40; and the ship being otherwise in equal proportion, this raised her to such an enormous bulk, that she appeared at a distance like a floating mountain or island; and, upon a nearer view, like a prodigious caille on the ocean. She was 280 cubits long, 38 broad, and 48 high (each cubit being 1 English foot 5½ inches), and carried 400 rowers, 400 sailors, and 3000 soldiers. Another which the same\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThe same prince made to fail on the Nile, we are told, was half a stadium long. Yet there were nothing in comparison of Hiero's ship, built under the direction of Archimedes; on the structure of which Moschion wrote a whole volume. There was wood enough employed in it to make 50 galleys; it had all the variety of apartments of a palace; such as banqueting-rooms, galleries, gardens, fish-ponds, stables, mills, baths, and a temple to Venus. The floors of the middle apartment were all inlaid, and represented in various colours the stories of Homer's Iliad. The ceilings, windows, and all other parts, were finished with wonderful art, and embellished with all kinds of ornaments. In the uppermost apartment there was a spacious gymnasion, or place for exercise, and water was conveyed to the garden by pipes, some of hardened clay, and others of lead. The floors of the temple of Venus were inlaid with agates and other precious stones; the inside lined with cypress wood; the windows adorned with ivory paintings and small statues. There was likewise a library. This vessel was adorned on all sides with fine paintings. It had 20 benches of oars, and was encompassed with an iron rampart, eight towers, with walls and bulwarks, furnished with machines of war, particularly one which threw a stone of 300 pounds, or a dart 12 cubits long, the space of half a mile, with many other particulars related by Athenaeus. Caligula likewise built a vessel adorned with jewels in the poop, with sails of many colours, and furnished with large porticoes, bagnios, and banqueting-rooms, besides rows of vines, and fruit-trees of various kinds. But these, and all such monstrous fabrics, served only for show and ostentation, being rendered by their vast bulk unwieldy and unfit for service. Athenaeus informs us, the common names they were known by, were Cyclades, or Etna, i.e. \"islands, or mountains,\" to which they seemed nearly equal in bigness; consisting, as some report, of as many materials as would have composed 50 triremes, or ships of three banks.\n\nThe vessels employed by the northern nations appear to have been still more imperfect than those of the Romans; for a law was enacted in the reign of the emperor Honorius, 24th September, A.D. 418, inflicting capital punishment on any who should instruct the barbarians in the art of ship-building; a proof at once of the great estimation in which this science was then held, and of the ignorance of the barbarians with regard to it.\n\nThe fleet of Richard I. of England, when he weighed anchor for the holy war from Messina, in Sicily, where he had passed the winter, A.D. 1190-1, is said to have consisted of 150 great ships and 53 galleys, besides barks, tartans, &c. What kinds of ships these were is not mentioned. To the crusades, however pernicious in other respects, this science seems to owe some improvements; and to this particular one we are indebted for Richard's marine code, commonly called the Laws of Oleron, from the name of a small island on the coast of France, where he composed them, and which most of the nations in Europe have made the basis of their maritime regulations. Those ships, if they merited the name of ships, were probably very small, as we find that so long after as the time of Edward I., anno 1304, 40 men were deemed sufficient to man the best and largest vessels in England; and that Edward the Third, anno 1335, ordained the mayor and sheriffs of London to take up all ships in their port, and all other ports in the kingdom, of the burden of 40 tons and upwards, and to furnish the same with armed men and other necessaries of war, against the Scots his enemies, confederated with certain persons of foreign nations.\" Edward the Third's fleet before Calais, anno 1347, consisted of 738 English ships, carrying 14,036 mariners, being on an average but 20 men to each ship; 15 ships and 459 mariners, from Bayonne in Guienne, being 30 men to each ship; 7 ships and 184 men from Spain, which is 26 men to each ship; one from Ireland, carrying 25 men; 14 from Flanders, with 133 men, being scarcely 10 men to each ship; and one from Guelderland, with 24 mariners. Fifteen of these were called the king's own ships, manned with 419 mariners, being somewhat under 17 to each ship.\n\nHistorians represent the vessels of Venice and Genoa as the largest and the best about this time, but they were soon exceeded in size by the Spanish vessels called carrickets, some of which carried cannon; and these again were exceeded by the vessels built by the northern people, particularly those belonging to the Hanse towns.—In the 14th century, the Hanseatics were the sovereigns of the northern seas, as well without as within the Baltic; and their ships were so large, that foreign princes often hired them in their wars. According to Hakluyt, an English ship from Newcastle, of 200 tons burden, was seized in the Baltic by those of Wilmar and Roilock, anno 1394; and another English vessel of the Fadera, same burden was violently seized in the port of Lisbon, anno 1412.\n\nSoon after ships of a much larger size were constructed. It is mentioned that a very large ship was purchased, anno 1449, by John Taverner of Hull; and in 1506, vol. xi. the year 1455, King Henry IV. at the request of Charles king of Sweden, granted a licence for a Swedish ship of the burden of a thousand tons or under, laden with merchandize, and having 120 persons on board, to come to the ports of England, there to dispose of their lading, and to relade back with English merchandize, paying the usual customs. The inscription on the tomb of William Canning, an eminent merchant, who had been five times mayor of Bristol, in Ratcliff-church at Bristol, anno 1474, mentions his having forfeited the king's peace, for which he was condemned to pay 300 marks; in lieu of which sum, King Edward IV. took of him 2470 tons of shipping, amongst which there was one ship of 900 tons burden, another of 500 tons, and one of 400 tons, the rest being smaller.\n\nIn the year 1506, King James IV. of Scotland built the largest ship which had hitherto been seen, but which was lost in her way to France in the year 1512, owing probably to a defective construction, and the unskillfulness of the crew in managing so large a ship.—About this time a very large ship was likewise built in France. In the fleet fitted out by Henry VIII. anno 1512, there was one ship, the Regent, of 1000 tons burden, one of 900, and three of 400 each. A ship still larger than the Regent was built soon after, called Henri Grace Dieu! In the year 1522 the first voyage round the globe was finished.\n\nThe English naval historians think that ships carried cannon on their upper decks only, and had no gunports before the year 1545; and it is certain that many of,\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nof the largest ships in former times were fitted out from harbours, where ships of moderate size now would not have water enough to float them. In 1575 the whole of the royal navy did not exceed 24 ships, and the number of merchant-ships belonging to England amounted to no more than 135 vessels above 100 tons, and 656 between 40 and 100 tons. At Queen Elizabeth's death, anno 1603, there were not above four merchant-ships in England of 400 tons burden each.\n\nThe largest of Queen Elizabeth's ships of war was 1000 tons burden, carrying but 340 men, and 40 guns, and the smallest 600 tons, carrying 150 men and 30 guns. Smaller vessels were occasionally hired by her from private owners.\n\nIn the memorable sea-fight of Lepanto between the Turks and Christians, anno 1571, no vessels were employed but galleys; and it would appear from the carcases of some of them, which are still preserved in the arsenal at Venice, that even these were not so large or so well constructed as those of our times. The Invincible Armada, as Spanish vanity styled it, once the terror and admiration of nations, in the pompous and exaggerated descriptions of which the Spanish authors of those times dwelt with so much apparent pleasure, consisted of 130 ships, near 100 of which were the state-ships that had yet been seen on the ocean. The largest of these, however, would be no more than a third rate vessel in our navy, and they were so ill constructed, that they would neither move easily, fail near the wind, nor be properly worked in tempestuous weather. The whole of the naval force collected by Queen Elizabeth to oppose this formidable fleet, including hired vessels, tenders, store-ships, &c., amounted to no more than 143.\n\nShip-building began now to make a considerable progress in Britain. Both war and trade required an increase of shipping; so that, in the year 1670, the annual charge of the navy was reported to be 500,000l.; and in 1678 the navy consisted of 83 ships, of which 58 were of the line. At this time the exports amounted to ten millions per annum; and the balance of trade was two millions. In 1689 there were 173 ships, great and small, in the royal navy, and it has been constantly increasing; so that in 1761 the ships in the navy amounted to 372, of which 129 were of the line; and in the beginning of the year 1795, the total amount was above 430.\n\nAs ships of the common construction are found to be very defective in many particulars, various methods have therefore from time to time been proposed to remove some of the bad qualities they possessed. As it would be an endless task to enumerate the different inventions for this purpose, a few of them only will now be mentioned.\n\nIn 1663 Sir William Petty constructed a double ship, or rather a single ship with a double bottom, which was found to sail considerably faster than any of the ships with which it had an opportunity of being tried. Her first voyage was from Dublin to Holyhead; and in her return \"she turned into that narrow harbour against wind and tide, among rocks and ships, with such dexterity as many ancient seamen confessed they had never seen the like.\" This vessel with 70 more was lost in a dreadful tempest.\n\nThis subject was again revived by Mr Gordon, in his Principles of Naval Architecture, printed at Aberdeen anno 1784; where, having delivered his sentiments on the construction of large vessels, he says: \"These experiments likewise point out to us methods by which two vessels may be laterally connected together, though at a considerable distance from each other, in a manner sufficiently strong, with very little increase of weight or expense of materials, and without exposing much surface to the action or influence of the wind or the waves, or obstructing their motion in any considerable degree, and consequently without being much opposed by them on that account under any circumstances; and if vessels are judiciously constructed with a view to such a junction, it would be no easy matter to enumerate all the advantages that may be obtained by this means.\" He then enumerates the advantages that double vessels would have over those of the common construction. And lately Soon after double ships were actually built by Mr Miller of Dalmuirton.\n\nAnother plan was proposed by Mr Gordon to make a ship fail fast, draw little water, and to keep a good wind. For this purpose, \"the bottom (he says) should be formed quite flat, and the sides made to rise perpendicularly, which would not only render her more steady, as being more opposed to the water in rolling, but likewise more convenient for poled to be rowage, &c., while the simplicity of the form would diminish the draught of water, &c., in which she might be fabricated. Though diminishing velocity, &c., the draught of water is, ceteris paribus, undoubtedly the most effectual method of augmenting the velocity with which vessels go before the wind; yet, as it proportionally diminishes their hold of the water, it renders them extremely liable to be driven to leeward, and altogether incapable of keeping a good wind. This defect may, however, be remedied, in a simple and effectual manner, by proportionally augmenting the depth of the keel, or, as far as possible, a keel would be inconvenient on the keel, many accounts, proportionally increasing their number; or by inserting, in place of adding a keel eight feet deep to a vessel drawing six feet water, to affix to different parts of her the same flat bottom, which would be well adapted for receiving her of them, fix different keels of two feet deep each at equal distances from each other, with proper intervals between; which will be found equally effectual for preventing these pernicious effects. Four such, indeed, would have answered the purpose as well as the eight feet keel, were it not for the superior pressure or resistance of the lower water (A).\n\nThus\n\n(A) This is frequently repeated on the authority of Mr Gordon and others. Theory says otherwise; and the experiments of Sir Isaac Newton show in the most unexceptionable manner, that the resistance of a ball descending through the water is the same at all depths; nay, the heaping up of the water on the bow, occasioning a hydrostatic pressure in addition to the real resistance, will make the whole opposition to an equal surface, but of greater horizontal dimensions, greater, because it bears a greater proportion to the resistance.\nThus then it appears, that a vessel drawing eight feet water only, keels and all, may be made to keep as good a wind, or be as little liable to be driven to leeward, as the sharpest built vessel of the same length drawing 14, nay 20 or upwards, if a few more keels are added, at the same time that she would be little more resifted in moving in the line of the keels than a vessel drawing six feet water only. These keels, besides, would strengthen the vessel considerably, would render her more steady, and less liable to be overset, and thereby enable her to carry more sail; and Mr Gordon then enumerates the several advantages that a ship of this construction will possess.\n\nThis plan has been put into execution by Captain Schank, with this difference only, that instead of the keels being fixed as proposed by Mr Gordon, Captain Schank constructed them so as to slide down to a certain depth below the bottom, or to be drawn up within the ship as occasion might require.\n\nCaptain Schank having communicated his plans to the Navy Board, two vessels were in consequence ordered to be built of 13 tons each, and similar in dimensions, one on the old construction, and the other flat-bottomed, with sliding keels. In 1790 a comparative trial in presence of the commissioners of the navy was made on the river Thames, each having the same quantity of sail; and although the vessel on the old construction had iceboards, a greater quantity of ballast, and two Thames pilots aboard, yet Captain Schank's vessel with three sliding keels beat the other vessel, to the astonishment of all present, one half of the whole distance sailed; and no doubt she would have beat her much more had she been furnished with a Thames pilot.\n\nThis trial gave so much satisfaction, that a king's cutter of 120 tons was immediately ordered to be built on the same construction, and Captain Schank was requested to superintend its building. This vessel was launched at Plymouth in 1791, and named the Trial. The length of this vessel is 66 feet, breadth 21 feet, and depth of the hold seven feet: her bottom is quite flat, and draws only six feet water, with all her guns, stores, &c., whereas all other vessels of her tonnage on the old construction draw 14 feet; so that she can go with safety into almost any harbour or creek. She has three sliding keels inclosed in a case or well; they are each 14 feet in length; the fore and the after keels are three feet broad each, and the middle keel is five feet broad. The keels are moveable by means of a winch, and may be let down seven feet below the real keel; and they work equally well in a storm as in still water. Her hold is divided into several compartments, all watertight, and so contrived, that should even a plank or two start at sea in different parts of the vessel, she may be navigated with the greatest security to any place. If she should be driven on shore in a gale of wind, she will not soon become a wreck, as her keels will be driven up into their cases, and the ship being flat-bottomed, will not be easily overset; and being able to go into such shallow water, the crew may all be easily saved. By means of her sliding keel she is kept steady in the greatest gale; she is quite easy in a great sea, does not strain in the least, and never takes in water on her deck; and when at anchor, she rides more upright and even than any other ship can do: she sails very fast either before or upon a wind; no vessel she has ever been in company with, of equal size, has been able, upon many trials, to beat her in sailing; and yet her sails seem too small.\n\nIt has also been proposed to construct vessels of other materials than wood; and a vessel was built whose bottom, instead of being planks, was copper.\n\nBook I. Containing the Method of Delineating the several Sections of a Ship.\n\nChap. I. Of the Properties of Ships.\n\nA ship ought to be constructed so as to answer the general particular purpose for which she is intended. It would be an easy matter to determine the form of a ship intended to fail by means of oars; but, when sails are used, a ship is then acted upon by two elements, the wind and water; and therefore it is much more difficult than is commonly imagined to ascertain the form of a ship so as to answer in an unfavourable as well as a favourable wind; the ship at the same time having a cargo of a certain weight and magnitude.\n\nEvery ship ought to fail well, but particularly when the wind is upon the beam; for this purpose a considerate ship able length in proportion to the breadth is necessary, must pose and the plane of resistance should be the least possible. The main frame should also be placed in a proper situation; but according to the experiments of Mr Chapman*, its plane is variable with the velocity of the ship: the mean place of the main frame has, however, been generally estimated to be about one-twelfth of the length of the keel before the middle. Without a sufficient degree of stability a ship will not be able to carry a press of sail: a great breadth in proportion to the length and low upper-works will augment the stability. The following particulars being attended to, the above property will be gained, and the ship will also steer well. The wing transom should be carried pretty high; the fashion-pieces well formed, and not full below the load water-line: the lower part of the stem to be a portion of a circle, and to have a considerable rake: the sternpost to be nearly perpendicular to the keel; and all the upper works kept as low as possible.\n\nMany ships from construction are liable to make much lee-way. This may in a great measure be avoided by giving the ship a long keel, little breadth, and a considerate, a good able depth in the hold: whence the bow will meet with little resistance in comparison to the side, and therefore the ship will not fall much to the leeward.\n\nAnother very great retardation to the velocity of a ship is her pitching. The principal remedy for this is to smoothly increase the length of the keel and floor, to diminish without the rising afore and abaft, and to construct the hull in such a manner that the contents of the fore-body may be duly proportioned to the contents of the after-body.\n\nIn a ship of war the lower tier of guns ought to be of a sufficient height above the water, otherwise it will be impossible to work the lee-guns when it blows hard, lower deck. This property will be obtained by giving her a long sufficiently floor-timber, little rising, a full midship frame, light upper works, and the wing transom not too high: And the water, in every ship the extreme breadth ought always to be higher afore and abaft than at midships.\nA merchant ship, besides being a fast sailer, ought to carry a considerable cargo in proportion to its length, to fail with little ballast, and to be navigated with few hands.\n\nThat a ship may take in a considerable cargo, it should have a great breadth and depth in proportion to its length, a full bottom, and a long and flat floor. But a ship of this construction will neither fail fast, nor carry much sail.\n\nIf a ship be filled out much towards the line of floatation, together with low upper works, the will require little ballast; and that ship which is stiff from construction is much better adapted for failing fast than one which, in order to carry the same quantity of canvas, is obliged to be loaded with a much greater weight: for the resiliency is as the quantity of water to be removed, or nearly as the area of a transverse section of the immersed part of the body at the midship frame; and a body that is broad and shallow is much stiffer than one of the same capacity that is narrow and deep.\n\nThe advantages (says Mr Gordon) are numerous, important, and obvious. For it is evident, that by enlarging, perhaps doubling, the breadth of vessels, and forming their bottoms flat and well furnished with keels, they must, in the first place, become much steadier, roll little, if any, and be enabled to carry greatly more sail, and that in a better direction, at the same time that they would be in no danger of being dismasted or overfilled, unless the masts were of a most extraordinary height indeed. Secondly, They would have little or no occasion for ballast, and if any was used, could incur less danger from its shifting. Thirdly, That there would be much more room upon deck, as well as accommodation below; the breadth being so much increased without any diminution of the height above the load-water line. Fourthly, That they would deviate much less from the intended course, and penetrate the water much easier in the proper direction: for doubling the breadth, without any increase of weight, would diminish the depth or draught of water one half; and though the extent of the directly opposing surface would be the same as before, yet the vessel in moving would meet with half the former resiliency only; for so great is the difference between the pressure, force, or reaction, of the upper and the under water. Fifthly, That they would by this means be adapted for lying unsupported in docks and harbours when dry, be rendered capable of being navigated in shallow water, and of being benefited by all the advantages attending that very important circumstance; and it is particularly to be observed, that making vessels which may be navigated in shallow water, may, in many respects, justly be regarded as a matter of equal importance with increasing the number of harbours, and improving them, as having identically the same effects with regard to navigation; at the same time, that the benefits which would result from such circumstances are obtained by this means without either expense, trouble, or inconvenience: besides, it would not only enable vessels to enter many rivers, bays, and creeks, formerly inaccessible to ships of burden, but to proceed to such places as are most landlocked, where they can lie or ride most secure, and with least expense of men and ground tackle. As ships of war would carry their guns well by being so steady, there could be but little occasion for a high topside, or much height of hull above water; and as little or no ballast would be required, there would be no necessity, as in other vessels, for increasing their weight on that account, and thereby pressing them deeper into the water. There are very important circumstances, and would contribute much to improve the failing of such vessels.” From whence it appears, that there would be united, what has hitherto been deemed irreconcilable, the greatest possible stability, which is nearly as the area of a transverse section of the immersed part of the body at the midship frame: and a body that is broad and shallow is much stiffer than one of the same capacity that is narrow and deep. A ship of this construction may take in a considerable cargo in proportion to her size; but if deeply loaded will not fail fast, for then the area of a section of the immersed part at the midship frame will be very considerable; and as the sails of such a ship must necessarily be large, more hands will therefore be required.\n\nThe less the breadth of a ship, the fewer hands will be necessary to work her; as in that case the quantity of sail navigated will be less, and the anchors also of less weight. We shall gain much (says M. Bouguer) by making the extreme breadth no more than the fifth or sixth part of the length, if, at the same time, we diminish the depth proportionally; and likewise this most surprising circumstance, that by diminishing these two dimensions, or by increasing the length, a ship may be made to go sometimes as fast as the wind.\n\nIn order to obtain the preceding properties, very opposite rules must be followed; and hence it appears to unite all the impossible to construct a ship so as to be possessed of the qualities mentioned. The body, however, must be formed, that as many of these properties may be retained as possible, always observing to give the preference to those which are most required. If it is known what particular trade the ship is to be employed in, those qualities are then principally to be adhered to which are most essentially necessary for that employment.\n\nIt may easily be demonstrated that small ships will not have the same advantages as large ones of a similar form, when employed in the same trade: for a larger ship will not only fail faster than a small one of a similar form, but will also require fewer hands to work her. Hence, in order that a small ship may possess the same advantages as a large one, the corresponding dimensions will not be proportional to each other. The reader will find in Chapman’s Architectura Navalis Mercatoria ample tables of the several dimensions of ships, of different classes and sizes, deduced from theory combined with experiment. Tables of the dimensions of the principal ships of the British navy, and of other ships, are contained in the Ship-builder’s Repository, and in Murray’s Treatise on Ship-building.\n\nChap. II. Of the different Plans of a Ship.\n\nWhen it is proposed to build a ship, the proportional size of every part of her is to be laid down; from whence the form and dimensions of the timbers, and of every particular piece of wood that enters into the construction, is to be found. As a ship has length, breadth, and depth, three different plans at least are necessary to exhibit.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nRibband lines, are curves on a ship's bottom by the interference of a plane inclined to the plane of elevation; and are denominated diagonal or horizontal, according as they are measured upon the diagonal, or in a direction perpendicular to the plane of elevation. Both these answer to the same curve on the ship's bottom, but give very different curves when described on the half breadth plan.\n\nFrames, are circular pieces of timber bolted together, and raised upon the keel at certain distances, and composed of a floor-timber, two or three futtocks, and a top-futtock, timber on each side: which being united together, form a circular inclosure, and that which incloses the greatest space is called the midship or main frame. The arms of the floor-timber of this frame form a very obtuse angle; but in the other frames this angle decreases with the distance of the frame from midships. Those floor-timbers which form very acute angles are called crutches. The length of the midship floor-timber is in general about half the length of the main frame.\n\nA frame of timbers is commonly formed by arches of sweeps of circles called sweeps. There are generally five sweeps: the first, the floor sweep; which is limited by a line in the frame, body plan perpendicular to the plane of elevation, a little above the keel; and the height of this line above the keel at the midship frame is called the dead rising. The upper part of this arch forms the head of the floor timber. 2d, The lower breadth sweep; the centre of which is in the line representing the lower height of breadth. 3d, The reconciling sweep. This sweep joins the two former, without interfering either; and makes a fair curve from the lower height of breadth to the rising line. If a straight line is drawn from the upper edge of the keel to touch the back of the floor sweep, the form of the midship frame below the lower height of breadth will be obtained. 4th, The upper breadth sweep; the centre of which is in the line representing the upper height of breadth of the timber. This sweep described upwards forms the lower part of the top timber. 5th, The top timber sweep is that which forms the hollow of the top timber. This hollow is, however, very often formed by a mould, so placed as to touch the upper breadth sweep, and pass through the point limiting the half breadth of the top timber.\n\nThe main frame, or as it is usually called dead-flat, is denoted by the character ⊕. The timbers before dead-flat are marked A, B, C, &c., in order; and those abait dead-flat by the figures 1, 2, 3, &c. The timbers adjacent to dead-flat, and of the same dimensions nearly, are distinguished by the characters (A), (B), &c., and (1), (2), &c. That part of the ship abait the main frame is called the after body; and that before it the fore body.\n\nAll timbers are perpendicular to the half breadth plan. Those timbers whose planes are perpendicular to the sheer plan, are called square timbers; and those whose planes are inclined to it are called canted timbers.\n\nThe rising line, is a curve drawn in the sheer plan, at the heights of the centres of the floor sweeps in the body plan. As, however, this line, if drawn in this manner, would extend beyond the upper line of the figure, it is therefore usually drawn that its lower part may touch the upper edge of the keel. This is performed by taking the heights of each of the centres in\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nthe body plan, from the height of the centre of the sweep of dead-flat, and setting them off on the corresponding timbers in the sheer plan from the upper edge of the keel.\n\nHalf breadth of the rising, is a curve in the floor plan, which limits the distances of the centres of the floor sweeps from the middle line of the body plan.\n\nThe rising of the floor, is a curve drawn in the sheer plan, at the height of the ends of the floor timbers. It is limited at the main frame or dead flat by the dead rising, and in flat ships is nearly parallel to the keel for some timbers afore and abaft the midship frame; for which reason these timbers are called flats: but in sharp ships it rises gradually from the main frame, and ends on the stem and post.\n\nCutting-down line, is a curve drawn on the plane of elevation. It limits the depth of every floor timber at the middle line, and also the height of the upper part of the dead wood afore and abaft.\n\nTimber and room, or room and space, is the distance between the moulding edges of two timbers, which must always contain the breadth of two timbers and an interval of about two or three inches between them. In forming the timbers, one mould serves for two, the foreside of the one being supposed to unite with the aftside of the other, and so make only one line, which is called the joint of the timbers.\n\nIn order to illustrate the above, and to explain more particularly the principal pieces that compose a ship, it will be necessary to give a description of them. These pieces are for the most part represented according to the order of their disposition in fig. 1.\n\nA, Represents the pieces of the keel to be securely bolted together and clinched.\n\nB, the sternpost, which is tenanted into the keel, and connected to it by the knee G.\n\nE, The back of the post, which is also tenanted into the keel, and securely bolted to the post; the intention of it is to give sufficient breadth to the port, which seldom can be got broad enough in one piece. C is the false post, which is fayed (B) to the fore part of the sternpost.\n\nC, The stem, in two pieces, to be scarfed together. The stem is joined to the fore foot, which makes a part of both.\n\nH, The apron, in two pieces, to be scarfed together, and fayed on the inside of the stem, to support the scarf thereof; and therefore the scarf of the apron must be at some distance from that of the stem.\n\nI, The stemlon, in two pieces, to support the scarf of the apron.\n\nD, The beams which support the decks; and F the knees by which the beams are fastened to the sides of the ship.\n\nK, The wing transom: it is fayed across the sternpost, and bolted to the head of it, and its extremities are fastened to the fashion pieces. L, Is the deck transom, parallel to the wing transom. M, N, Two of the lower transoms: these are fastened to the sternpost and fashion pieces in the same manner as the wing transom.\n\nQ, The knee which fastens the transom to the ship's side. And, O, The fashion piece, of which there is one on each side. The keel of the fashion piece is connected with the dead-wood, and the head is fastened to the wing transom.\n\nR, S, Breast-hooks: these are fayed in the inside to the stem, and to the bow on each side of it, to which they are fastened with proper bolts. There are generally four or five in the hold, in the form of that marked R, and one in the form of that marked S, into which the lower deck planks are rabbeded: There is also one immediately under the hause holes, and another under the second deck.\n\nT, The rudder, which is joined to the sternpost by the rudder irons, upon which it turns round in the goings, fastened to the sternpost for that purpose. There is a mortise cut in the head of the rudder, into which a long bar is fitted called the tiller, and by which the rudder is turned.\n\nU, A floor timber: it is laid across the keel, to which it is fastened by a bolt through the middle.\n\nV, V, V, V, The lower, the second, third, and fourth futtocks. W, W, The top timbers. These represent the length and scarf of the several timbers in the midship frame.\n\nX, The pieces which compose the kelgon. They are scarfed together in the same manner as the keel, and placed over the middle of the floor timbers, being scored about an inch and a half down upon each side of them, as represented in the figure.\n\nY, The several pieces of the knee of the head; the lower part of which is fayed to the stem, and its keel is scarfed to the head of the forefoot. It is fastened to the bow by two knees, called cheeks, in the form of that represented by Z; and to the stem, by a knee called a flandard, in the form of that marked Θ.\n\na, The cathead, of which there is one on each side of the bow, projecting so far as to keep the anchor clear of the ship when it is hove up.\n\nb, The bits, to which the cable is fastened when the ship is at anchor.\n\nd, The side counter-timbers, which terminate the ship abaft within the quarter gallery.\n\ne, e, Two pieces of dead wood, one afore and the other abaft, fayed on the keel.\n\nFig. 2, is a perspective representation of a ship fra-\n\nFig. 2, made ready for the planking; in which A, A is the keel; B, the sternpost; C, the stem; K, L, M, the transoms; F, F, F, F, F, F, the ribbands.\n\nCHAP. III. Containing Preliminary Problems, &c.\n\nThe general dimensions of a ship are the length, breadth, and depth.\n\nTo ascertain those dimensions that will best answer the intended purpose is, no doubt, a problem of considerable difficulty; and, from theory, it may be shown that there are no determinate proportions subsisting between the length, breadth, and depth, by which these dimensions may be settled; yet, by combining theory derived from practice, the proportional dimensions may be approximated to pretty nearly.\n\n(b) To fay, is to join two pieces of timber close together.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nAs ships are constructed for a variety of different purposes, their principal dimensions must therefore be altered accordingly, in order to adapt them as nearly as possible to the proposed intention; but since there is no fixed standard whereby to regulate these dimensions, the methods therefore introduced are numerous, and in a great measure depend upon custom and fancy.\n\nWith regard, however, to the proportional dimensions, they perhaps may be inferred from the circle. Thus, if the extreme breadth be made equal to the diameter, the length at the load water line, or the distance between the rabbets of the stem and post at that place, may be made equal to the circumference of the same circle; and the depth of the hold equal to the radius, the upper works being continued upwards according to circumstances. A ship formed from these dimensions, with a bottom more or less full according as may be judged necessary, will no doubt answer the proposed intention. Nevertheless, one or other of these dimensions may be varied in order to gain some essential property, which the trade that the vessel is intended for may require.\n\nThe following hints are given by Mr Hutchinson towards fixing rules for the best construction of ships' bottoms.\n\n1. \"I would recommend (says he), to prevent ships' bottoms from hogging† upwards amidships, to have the fore and after part of their keels deep enough, that the upper part may be made to admit a rabbet for the garboard streak, that the main body and bearing part of the ship's bottoms may be made to form an arch downwards in their length, suppose with the same sheer as their bends, at the rate of about 2 inches for every 30 feet of the extreme length of the keel towards the midship or main frame, which may be reckoned the crown of the arch; and the lower part of the keel to be made straight, but laid upon blocks so that it may form a regular convex curve downwards at the rate of an inch for every 30 feet of the extreme length of the keel, the lowest part exactly under the main frame; which curve, I reckon, is only a sufficient allowance for the keel to become straight below, after they are launched afloat, by the prelude of the water upward against their floors amidships, which causes their tendency to hog. And certainly a straight keel is a great advantage in sailing, as well as to support them when laid upon level ground or on straight blocks in a repairing dock, without taking damage.\"\n\n2. \"As square sterned ships, from experience, are found to answer all trades and purposes better than round or pink sterned ships, I would recommend the fore part of the sternpost, on account of drawing the water lines in the draught, only to have a few inches rake, that the after part may stand quite upright perpendicular to the keel; and for the rake of the stem I would propose the rabbet for the hudding ends for the entrance, and bows from the keel upwards, to form the same curve as the water line from the stem at the harpin towards the main breadth, and the bows at the harpin to be formed by a sweep of a circle of half the three-fourths of the main breadth; and the main transom to be three-fourths of the main breadth; and the buttocks, at the load or sailing mark aft, to be formed, in the same manner as the bows at the harpin, with a sweep of a circle of half the three-fourths of the main breadth, to extend just as far from the stem and stern post as to admit a regular convex curve to the main frame, and from the bow down to the keel to form regular convex waterlines, without any of those unnatural, hollow, concave ones, either in the entrance or run; which rules, in my opinion, will agree with the main body of the ship, whether she is designed to be built full for burden or sharp below for failing.\n\n3. \"This rule for raking the stem will admit all the water-lines in the ship's entrance to form convex curves all the way from the stem to the midship or main frame, which answers much better for failing as well as making a ship more easy and lively in bad weather. And the bows should flange off, rounding in a circular form from the bends up to the gunwale, in order to meet the main breadth the sooner, with a sweep of half the main breadth at the gunwale amidships; which will not only prevent them greatly from being plunged under water in bad weather, but spread the standing fore-rigging the more, to support these material masts and sails forward to much greater advantage than in those over sharp-bowed ships, as has been mentioned. And as the failing trim of ships in general is more or less by the stern, this makes the water lines of the entrance in proportion the sharper to divide the particles of water the easier, so that the ship may pass through it with the least resistance.\n\n4. \"The run ought to be formed shorter or longer, fuller or sharper, in proportion to the entrance and main body, as the ship is designed for burden or failing sail. The convex curves of the water lines should lessen gradually from the load or sailing mark aft, as has been mentioned, downwards, till a fair straight taper is formed from the after part of the floor to the sternpost below, without any concavity in the water lines; which will not only add buoyancy and burden to the after body and run of the ship, but, in my opinion, will help both her failing and steering motions; for the prelude of the water, as it closes and rises upon it to come to its level again, and fill up that hollow which is made by the fore and main body being prelled forward with sail, will impinge, and act with more power to help the ship forward in her progressive motion, than upon those unnatural concave runs, which have so much more flat dead wood, that must, in proportion, be a hinderance to the stern being turned so easily by the power of the helm to steer the ship to the greatest advantage.\"\n\nMany and various are the methods which are employed to describe the several parts of a ship. In the following problems, however, those methods only are given which appear to be most easily applied to practice, and which, at the same time, will answer any proposed purpose.\n\nPROBLEM I. To describe in the plane of elevation the sheer or curvature of the top timbers.\n\nLet QR (fig. 3.) be the length of the ship between the wing transom and the rabbet of the stem. Then ccclxxxv., since it is generally agreed, especially by the French Fig. 3., constructors, that the broadest part of the ship ought to be about one-twelfth of the length before the main frame or dead flat; therefore make R equal to five main frame twelfths of QR, and Θ will be the flotation of the main about one-twelfth frame; space the other frames on the keel, and from these points let perpendiculars be drawn to the keel. Let ΘP be the height of the ship at the main frame, the ship.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nPreliminary Problems.\n\nVF the height at the aftermost frame, and RK the height at the stem. Through P draw EPL parallel to the keel; describe the quadrants PGI, PMN, the radius being P ⊕; make PH equal to EF, and PO equal KL, and draw the parallels GH, OM: Divide GH similar to ⊕C, and OM similar to ⊕R. Through these points of division draw lines perpendicular to EL, and the several portions of these perpendiculars contained between EL and the arch will be the risings of the top-timber line above EL. A curve drawn through these points will form the top-timber line.\n\nThis line is more easily drawn by means of a curved or bent ruler, so placed that it may touch the three points F, P, and K.\n\nPROB. II. To describe the stem.\n\nLet K (fig. 3) be the upper part of the stem, through which draw KS parallel to the keel, and equal to twice KR: Through the termination of the wales on the stem draw TW parallel to QR. Then from the centre S, with the distance SK, describe an arch: Take an extent equal to the nearest distance between the parallels WT, QR; and find the point W, such that one point of the compasses being placed there, the other point will just touch the nearest part of the above arch; and from this point as a centre describe an arch until it meets the keel, and the stem will be formed.\n\nPROB. III. To describe the sternpost.\n\nSet off QV (fig. 3) for the rake of the post: draw VX perpendicular to the keel, and equal to the height of the wing transom, join QX, and it will represent the aft side of the post.\n\nPROB. IV. To describe the half breadth line.\n\nLet MN (fig. 4.) be the given length: Make N ⊕ equal to five-twelfths of MN; draw the line ⊕P perpendicular to MN, and equal to the proposed extreme half breadth. Let ME be the round aft of the stern or wing transom; make EO perpendicular to MN, and equal to the given half breadth at the stern, which is generally between two-thirds and three-fourths of the main half breadth; and describe the arch MO, the centre of which is in the middle line. Space the frames (A), A, B, &c. and (1), 1, 2, &c. From the centre ⊕, with the radius ⊕P, describe the quadrant PRS; describe also the quadrant PCT. Through the point O draw ORU parallel to MN; divide the straight line RU similar to M ⊕; and through these points of division draw lines perpendicular to MN, and meeting the arch. Transfer these lines to the correspondent frames each to each, and a curve drawn through the extremities will represent that part of the side contained between the main frame and the stern. Again, through Q, the extremity of the foremost frame, draw QV parallel to MN. Or make PV a fourth or third part of PU, according as it is intended to make the ship more or less full towards the bow. Divide VC similar to ⊕C; through these points draw lines perpendicular to MN, and terminating in the quadrantial arch: Transfer these lines to the corresponding timbers in the fore part, and a curve drawn through the extreme points will limit that part of the ship's side contained between P and Q. Continue the curve to the next timber at X. From Q draw QZ perpendicular to QX; make the angle ZNQ equal to ZQN, and the point Z will be the centre of the arch forming the bow. Remark, if it is proposed that the breadth of the ship at the frames adjacent to the main frame shall be equal to the breadth at the main frame; in this case, the centres of the quadrantial arches will be at the points of intersection of these frames with the line MN; namely, at (A) and (1). Also, if the height of the ship at the frames (A) and (1) is to be the same as at dead flat, the quadrantial arches in fig. 3, are to be described from the points of intersection of these frames with the line EL.\n\nThese rules, it is evident, are variable at pleasure; and any person acquainted with the first principles of mathematics may apply calculation to find the radii of the several sweeps.\n\nPROB. V. To describe the main frame or dead flat.\n\nThis frame is that which contains the greatest space, Of the mid- and the particular form of each of the other frames depends very much on it. If the ship is intended to carry a great burden in proportion to her principal dimensions, this frame is made very full; but if she is intended to sail fast, it is usually made sharp. Hence arises diversity of opinions respecting its form; each constructor using that which to him appears preferable. In order to save repetition, it is judged proper to explain certain operations which necessarily enter into all the different methods of constructing this frame.\n\nIn the plane of the upper side of the keel produced, General draw the line AB (fig. 5.) equal to the proposed breadth precepts for of the ship; bisect AB in C, and draw AD, CE, and describing BE, perpendicular to AB. Then, since the two sides of a ship are similar, it is therefore thought sufficient to describe the half of each frame between the main frame and the stern on one side of the middle line CE, and the half of each of those before the main frame on the other side of it. The first half is called the after-body, and the other the fore-body. The after-body is commonly described on the left side of the middle line; and the fore-body on the right side of it: hence the line AD is called the side line of the after body, and BF the side line of the fore body. Make AD and BF each equal to the height of the ship at the main frame. Make AG, BG, and AH, BH, equal to the lower and upper heights of breadth respectively, taken from the sheer plan. Let I I be the load water line, or line of floatation when the ship is loaded, and KK the height of the rising line of the floor at this frame. Make CN, CO, each equal to half the length of the floor timber, and NO, will be the heads of the floor timber, through which draw perpendiculars to AB. Make CM, EM, each equal to half the thickness of the sternpost, and CN, RN, equal to half the thickness of the stern, and join mm, nn.\n\nMethod I. Of describing a main frame.—From the centre a (fig. 5.), in the lower breadth line, describe the lower breadth sweep Ge; make Nb equal to the proposed radius of the floor sweep, and from the centre b describe the floor sweep Nf. Let the radius of the reconciling sweep be Ag, equal to about the half of AC; then make Ak equal to Nb, and Am equal to Ga. Now from the centre a, with an extent equal to gm, describe an arch, and from the centre b, with the extent gh, describe an arch intersecting the former in c, which will be the centre of the reconciling sweep ef. Join Nm by an inverted curve, the centre of which may be in the line bN produced downwards; or it may be joined...\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\njoined by two curves, or by a straight line if there is little rising; and hence the lower part of the main frame will be described.\n\nIn order to form the top timber, make $Fk$ equal to such part of the half breadth, agreeable to the proposed round of the side, as one-seventh; join $Hk$, and make $ki$ equal to about two-thirds of $Hk$: make the angle $Hi$ equal to $iHl$; and from the centre $l$ at the distance $lH$ describe the arch $Hi$; and from the centre $a$, the intersection of $li$, and $kF$ produced, describe the arch $ik$, and the top timber will be formed.\n\nII. To describe a main frame of an intermediate capacity, that is, neither too flat nor too sharp.—Divide the line $AX$ (fig. 6.), which limits the head of the floor timber, into three equal parts; and make $ab$ equal to one of them. Divide the line $db$, the perpendicular distance between the load water line and the plane of the upper side of the keel, into seven equal parts; and set off one of these parts from $d$ to $c$, and from $c$ to $m$. Let $GH$ be the lower deck, join $gm$, and produce it to $q$. Draw the straight line $Va$, bisect it in $n$, and from the points $n$, $a$, describe arches with the radius $Gq$, intersecting each other in $P$, which will be the centre of the arch $na$. The centre of the arch $Vn$ is found by describing arches downwards with the same radius.\n\nWith an extent equal to once and a half of $be$, describe arches from the points $b$, $e$, intersecting each other in $A$, and from this point as a centre describe the arch $eb$; make $al$ equal to $dm$, and join $Am$, $Al$. Then, in order to reconcile two arches so as to make a fair curve, the centres of these arches and of the points of contact must be in the same straight line. Hence the point $k$ will be the centre of the arch $dm$, and $o$ the centre of the arch $al$. The arch $lm$ is described from the centre $A$.\n\nTo form the top timber, set back the tenth part of the half breadth from $K$ to $S$ upon the line of the second deck; then with an extent equal to two-thirds of the whole breadth describe an arch through the points $S$ and $H$, the upper height of breadth. Again, make $MI$ equal to the fifth part of the half breadth; describe an arch of a circle through the points $S$ and $T$, taking the diagonal $GB$ for the radius. As this arch is inverted in respect of the arch $ds$, the centre will be without the figure. Hence one-half of the main frame is formed, and the other half is described by similar operations.\n\nRemark. This frame may be made more or less full by altering the several radii.\n\nIII. To describe a main frame of a circular form.—Let the several lines be drawn as before: Then make $Oa$ (fig. 7.) equal to the half breadth $Ga$, and from the centre $a$, with the radius $Ga$, describe the arch $bgco$. Let $d$ be the head of the floor-timber, and $dv$ the rising. Assume the point $j$ in the arch, according to the proposed round of the second futtock, and describe the arch $df$; the centre of which may be found as in the former method: from the centre $a$, with the distance $ad$, describe the arch $dec$; make $de$ equal to one-third of $do$, and the angle $dec$ equal to $cdh$, and from the centre $h$ describe the arch $dc$. The inverted arch $co$ may be described as before.\n\nIV. To describe a very full main frame.—Let the vertical and horizontal lines be drawn as before: let $b$, fig. 8., be the floor-head, and $bw$ the rising. Divide $gc$ into two equal parts in the point $d$, and upon $cd$ describe the square $dbac$, in which inscribe the quadrant $dea$. Divide the line $bd$ into any number of equal parts in the points $o$, $n$, $m$, $l$, and draw the lines $lm$, $mc$, $nn$, $ob$, perpendicular to $db$. Divide the line $gc$, the depth of the hold, the rising being deducted, into the same number of equal parts in the points $e$, $f$, $i$, $k$, and make the lines $ep$, $fq$, $ir$, $ks$, in the frame, equal to the lines $ob$, $nn$, $me$, $lm$, in the square, each to each respectively; and through the points $g$, $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $b$, describe a curve. The remaining part of the frame may be described by the preceding methods.\n\nV. To describe the main frame of a ship intended to be a fast sailer.—The principal lines being drawn as before, let the length of the floor-timber be equal to half the breadth of the ship, and the rising one-fifth or one-sixth of the whole length of the floor-timber, which lay off from $x$ to $e$, fig. 9. Through the point $e$ draw the line $tx$ perpendicular to $gc$, and $de$ perpendicular to $ag$. Join $ta$, which bisects $be$, and draw $bf$ perpendicular thereto, and meeting $cg$ produced in $f$, from the centre $f$, at the distance $ft$, describe the semicircle $td$. Divide $gt$ into any number of parts, $vw$, &c. and bisect the intervals $dv$, $dw$, &c. in the points $x$, $z$, &c.; then, from the centre $x$, with the extent $xv$, describe the semicircle $dbv$, intersecting $ag$ in $b$. Let $vp$ be drawn perpendicular to $gt$, and $bp$ perpendicular to $ag$, and the point of intersection $p$ will be one point through which the curve is to pass. In like manner proceed for the others, and a curve drawn through all the points of intersection will be part of the curve of the main frame. The remaining part of the curve from $e$ to $y$ will be composed of two arches, the one to reconcile with the former part of the curve at $e$, and the other to pass through the point $y$, the centre of which may be found by any of the preceding methods. In order to find the centre of that which joins with the curve at $e$, make $tr$ equal to the half of $gd$, and join $er$, in which a proper centre for this arch may be easily found.\n\nThe portion $gb$ of the curve is a parabola, whose vertex is $g$ and parameter $gd$.\n\nFor $gd : gb :: gb : gv$ by construction.\n\nHence $dg \\times gv = gb^2$, which is the equation for a parabola.\n\nVI. To describe a main frame of a middling capacity.—Let the length of the floor-timber be equal to one-half of the breadth of the ship. Make $od$, fig. 10., equal to one-fourth of the length of the floor-timber, and draw the perpendicular $dc$ equal to the rising, and divide it into two equal parts in the point $e$. Describe an arch through $e$, and the extremity $a$ of the floor-timber, the radius being equal to the half breadth, or more or less according to the proposed round of the floor-head. Then with the radius $ol$, half the length of the floor-timber, describe the arch $ey$.\n\nDraw $lm$ perpendicular to $oa$: bisect $an$ in $p$, and draw the perpendicular $pq$. From the middle of $ap$ draw the perpendicular $rs$, and from the middle of $ar$ draw the perpendicular $tu$. Make $nz$, $pq$, each equal to $ln$: make the distances $py$, $rb$, each equal to $ag$; $rf$, $te$, each equal to $ab$; and $tx$ equal to $ae$. Then a curve drawn through the points $a$, $z$, $y$, $f$, $x$, $t$, will form the under part of the midship frame.\n\nWe shall finish these methods of describing the main frame.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nFrame of a ship with the following remark from M. Vial du Clairbois*. \"It seems (says he) that they have affected to avoid straight lines in naval architecture; yet, geometrically speaking, it appears that a main frame formed of straight lines will have both the advantage and simplicity over others.\" To illustrate this, draw the straight line MN (fig. 9.) in such a manner that the mixtilinear space M a d may be equal to the mixtilinear space DNY. Hence the capacity of the main frame formed by the straight lines MN, NY will be equal to that of the frame formed by the curve Ma DY; and the frame formed by the straight lines will for the most part be always more susceptible of receiving a bow that will easily divide the fluid. It is also evident, that the cargo or ballast being lower in the frame formed of straight lines than in the other, it will therefore be more advantageously placed, and will enable the ship to carry more sail (c); so that having a bow equally well or better formed, she will sail faster.\n\nPROB. VI. To describe a stern having a square tuck.\n\nLet AB (fig. 11.) be the middle line of the poft, and let CD be drawn parallel thereto at a distance equal to half the thickness of the poft. Make CE equal to the height of the lower part of the fashion-piece above the keel; make CT equal to the height of the extremity G of the transom above the plane of the keel produced, and CH equal to the height of the transom on the poft, HT being equal to above one-ninth or one-tenth of GT, and describe the arch GH, the centre of which will be in BA produced: make EK equal to five-twelfths of ET: through K draw KL perpendicular to CD, and equal to EK; and with an extent equal to EL describe the arch EL. Make GI equal to the half of ET, and from the centre I describe the arch GM, and draw the reconciling curve ML.—Let the curve of the fashion-piece be produced upwards to the point representing the upper height of breadth as at O. Make ON equal to the height of the top-timber, and BN equal to the half breadth at that place, and join ON. Through N and the upper part of the counter, let arches be described parallel to GH. The taller, windows, and remaining part of the stern, may be finished agreeable to the fancy of the artist.\n\nIn fig. 12. the projection of the stern on the plane of elevation is laid down, the method of doing which is obvious from inspection.\n\nIf the transom is to round aft, then since the fashion-pieces are always fitted straight, their planes will intersect the sheer and floor planes in a straight line. Let GG' (fig. 14.) be the intersection of the plane of the fashion-piece with the floor plane. From the point g draw gW perpendicular to gM: make yk equal to the height of the tuck, and Wk being joined will be the intersection of the plane of the fashion-piece with the sheer plane. Let the water lines in the sheer plane produced meet the line kW in the points a, s, h, and draw the perpendiculars aa', ss', hh'. From the points a, s, h (fig. 14.) draw lines parallel to GG' to intersect each corresponding water line in the floor plane in the points 3, 2, 1.\n\nFrom the points G, 3, 2, 1, in the floor-plane draw Preliminary Problems perpendicular to gM, intersecting the water lines (fig. 13.) in the points G, 3, 2, 1; and through these points describe the curve G 3 2 1 k; and WG 3 2, 1 k will be the projection of the plane of the fashion-piece on the sheer plane. Through the points G, 3, 2, 1 (fig. 13.) draw the lines GF, 3 A, 2 S, 1 H, per-fig. 13. perpendicular to W k; and make the lines WF, a A, s S, h H, equal to the lines g G, a a, s s, h h (fig. 14.) respectively, and WFLASH k will be the true form of the plane of the aft-side of the fashion-piece. When it is in its proper position, the line WF will be in the same plane with the sheer line; the line a A in the same plane with the water line a 3; the line s S in the same plane with the water line s 2; and the line h H in the same plane with the water line h 1. If lines be drawn from the several points of intersection of the water lines with the rabbet of the port (fig. 13.), perpendicular to gM, and curved lines being drawn from these points to G, 3, 2, 1 (fig. 14.) respectively, will give the form and dimensions of the tuck at the several water lines.\n\nPROB. VII. To bevel the fashion-piece of a square tuck by water-lines.\n\nAs the fashion-piece both rakes and cants, the planes of the water-lines will therefore intersect it higher on the aft than on the fore-side; but before the heights on the fore-side can be found, the breadth of the timber must be determined; which let be b n (fig. 15.). Then, as it cant, the breadth in the direction of the water-line will exceed the true breadth. In order to find the true breadth, form the aft-side of the fashion-piece as directed in the last problem.\n\nLet t 5 (fig. 15.) be the aft-side of the rabbet on the outside of the poft, WM the common section of the plan of the fashion-piece and the sheer-plan. Before this last line can be determined, the several water-lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, must be drawn parallel to the keel, which may represent so many transoms.—Let these water-lines be formed and ended at the aft-side of the rabbet, as in fig. 14., where the rounds aft of the several transoms are described, limiting the curves of the water-lines. Now the line WM must rake so as to leave room for half the thickness of the poft, at the tuck: in order to which, produce Wg to r; make rg half the thickness of the poft; through r draw a line parallel to gM to intersect gG in b: then with the radius rb, from x the point of the tuck as a centre, describe an arch, and draw the line WM just to touch the back of that arch.\n\nThe line WM being drawn, let any point k in it be assumed at pleasure: from k draw ky perpendicular to gM: through y draw yf (fig. 14.) parallel to gG, intersecting the line Mf drawn perpendicular to gM in the point f. From M draw Mi perpendicular to yf, and from y draw yn perpendicular to WM (fig. 13.). Make Mn (fig. 15.) equal to Mi (fig. 14.); then MI (fig. 15.) being equal to yk (fig. 13.), join n 1, and the angle 1 n M will be the bevelling to the horizontal plane. Again, make Mz, Mf (fig. 15.) respectively equal to yn (fig. 13.) and Mf (fig. 14.), and join z f; and\n\n(c) It is not a general rule, that lowering the cargo of a ship augments her stability. This is demonstrated by the Chevalier de Borda, in a work published by M. de Goimpyn upon this subject. See also L'Architecture Navale par M. Vial du Clairbois, p. 23.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThe beveling being now found, draw the line \\( ab \\) (fig. 15.) parallel to \\( zn \\), \\( az \\) or \\( bn \\) being the scantling of the timber. Then \\( nx \\) will be the breadth of the timber on the horizontal plane, and \\( ze \\) its breadth on the sheer-plane, and \\( ac \\) what it is within a square.\n\nNow as the lines \\( gG, a3, s2, h1, y1 \\) represent the aft-side of the fashion-piece on the horizontal plane (fig. 14.), dotted lines may be drawn parallel to them to represent the fore-side, making \\( px \\) (fig. 15.) the perpendicular distance between the lines representing fore and aft sides of the fashion-piece. By these lines form the fore-side of the fashion-piece in the same manner as the aft-side was formed. The water-lines on the fore-side of the plane of the fashion-piece must, however, be first drawn in fig. 13.; thus: Draw the lines \\( eb, cd \\) parallel to \\( WM \\), and whose perpendicular distances therefrom may be equal to \\( ac \\) and \\( ze \\) (fig. 15.) respectively. Draw a line parallel to \\( aA \\) through the point where the line \\( cd \\) intersects the fifth water-line. Draw a line parallel to \\( aA \\) through the point where the fourth water-line intersects the line \\( cd \\); in like manner proceed with the other water-lines. The fore-side of the fashion-piece is now to be described by means of these new water-lines, observing that the distances in the floor-plane must be set off from the line \\( eb \\), and not from \\( WM \\), as in the former case; and a curve described through the points \\( 5, 3, 2, 1 \\), where these distances reach to, will represent the fore-side of the fashion-piece.\n\nThe nearest distance between the points \\( 5, 3, 2, 1 \\) and the aft side of the fashion-piece is what the beveling is beyond the square when both stock and tongue of the bevel are perpendicular to the timber. Make \\( M \\) (fig. 16.) equal to the breadth of the timber, and \\( M \\) equal to the perpendicular distance of the point \\( 5 \\) (fig. 13.) from the aft-side of the fashion-piece, and join \\( 5p \\). In like manner proceed with the others, and the bevelings at these parts will be obtained; but, in order to avoid confusion, the perpendiculars \\( 4, 3, 2, 1 \\) (fig. 13.), instead of being laid off from \\( M \\) (fig. 16.), were let off from points as far below \\( M \\) as the other extremities of the lines drawn from these points are below the point \\( p \\).\n\n**Prob. VIII.** To describe the transoms of a round poop.\n\nThe transoms are fastened to the stern-post in the same manner that the floor-timbers are fastened to the keel, and have a rising called the flight similar to the rising of the floor-timbers. The upper transom is called the wing transom, the next the deck transom, and the others the first, second, and third transoms in order. The wing transom has a round aft and a round up: the round up of the deck transom is the same as that of the beams.\n\nThe fashion-piece of a square tuck must be first described, together with the three adjacent frames, by the method to be explained. The part of the stern above the wing transom is to be described in the same manner as before, and may therefore be omitted in this place. The part below the keel of the fashion-piece is also the same in both cases. Let fig. 17. represent the fashion-piece of a square tuck, and the three adjoining frames. Divide the interval \\( AB \\) into four equal parts in the points \\( C, D, E, \\) and draw the perpendiculars \\( AF, CG, DH, EI, \\) and \\( BK \\): these will be portions of water-lines answering to the several transoms.\n\nLet these water-lines be described on the floor-plan (fig. 18.), in which \\( ABC \\) represents the wing transom. Describe the arch \\( BC \\) to reconcile the curves \\( A \\) and \\( CE \\). Let \\( LFG \\) be the water-line answering to the lower part of the fashion-piece, the distance between the points \\( L \\) and \\( A \\) being equal to the excess of the projection of the point \\( A \\) beyond that of \\( B \\) (fig. 20.). Draw \\( CK \\) (fig. 18.) perpendicular to \\( AM \\), and make the angle \\( KCM \\) equal to about 25 degrees, and \\( CN \\) will be the projection of the fashion-piece on the floor-plane. Make \\( AB \\) (fig. 19.) equal to \\( AB \\) Fig. 19. (fig. 17.). Divide it into four equal parts, and draw the perpendiculars \\( AF, CH, DI, EK, \\) and \\( BG \\). Make \\( AF \\) equal to \\( CM \\), and \\( BG \\) equal to \\( MN \\), and draw the curve \\( FHIKG \\), having a less curvature than the fashion-piece of the square tuck \\( SCPGN \\). Make \\( MO, MP, MQ \\), equal to \\( CH, DI, \\) and \\( EK \\) respectively. Divide \\( AL \\) (fig. 18.) into four equal parts, and to these points of division draw curves through the points \\( O, P, Q, \\) so as to partake partly of the curvature of \\( A \\) and partly of that of \\( LNF \\), but most of the curvature of that to which the proposed curve is nearest; and hence the form of the several transoms will be obtained.\n\nIn order to represent the curve of the fashion-piece on the plane of projection, make the lines \\( AF, CG, DH, EI, \\) and \\( BK \\) (fig. 17.) respectively equal to the perpendicular distance of the points \\( O, P, Q, \\) and \\( N \\). From the line \\( AN \\) (fig. 18.), and through the extremities of these lines, draw the curve \\( FGHK \\).\n\nIt remains to lay down the projection of the fashion-piece on the plane of elevation. In order to which, divide the line \\( AB \\), fig. 20. (equal to \\( AB \\), fig. 17.) into four equal parts, and through the points of division draw the perpendiculars \\( AF, CG, DH, EI, \\) and \\( BK \\); make \\( AF \\) (fig. 20.) equal to the perpendicular distance of the point \\( C \\) from the line \\( BL \\) (fig. 18.). In like manner make the lines \\( CG, DH, EI, \\) and \\( BK \\) (fig. 20.) respectively equal to the perpendicular distances of the points \\( O, P, Q, \\) and \\( N \\), from the line \\( BL \\) (fig. 18.); and a curve drawn through these points will be the projection of the fashion-piece on the plane of elevation.\n\n**Prob. IX.** To describe the intermediate frames in the after body.\n\nFor this purpose the midship and stern frames must be drawn in the plane of projection. As the main frame contains the greatest capacity, and the stern frame is that having the least, it hence follows that the form and dimensions of the intermediate frames will be between these; each frame, however, partaking most of the form of that to which it is nearest.\n\nLet \\( ACDE \\) (fig. 21.) be the main frame on the plane of projection, and \\( FGH \\) the stern frame; and let there be any convenient number of intermediate frames, as nine. Draw the floor ribband \\( CF \\), and the breadth ribband \\( GD \\). Divide the curves \\( CD, FG \\), each into the same number of equal parts, as three, in the points \\( K, M; L, N \\); and draw the second and third ribbands \\( KL, MN \\). In order to divide these ribbands so as to form fair curves in different sections, various methods have been proposed. One of the best of these, being that which is chiefly employed by the French constructors...\ntors is by means of an equilateral triangle, which is constructed as follows.\n\nDraw the line ME (fig. 22.), limited at M, but produced towards E: take M1 equal to any convenient extent; make 1, 2 equal to twice that extent, 2, 3 equal to five times, and 3, 4 equal to seven times the above extent; and continue this division to E, always increasing by two, until there be as many points as there are frames, including the main and stern frames. Upon ME describe the equilateral triangle MSE, and draw lines from the vertex S to each point of division; then the line SM will be that answering to the main frame, and SE that corresponding to the post; and the other lines will be those answering to the intermediate frames in order.\n\nLet fig. 23. be the projection of part of the stern on the plane of elevation, together with the eighth and ninth frames. From the points L, N, G, (fig. 21.) draw the lines LO, NP, GO, perpendicular to the plane of the upper edge of the keel. Make AB (fig. 23.) equal to AF (fig. 21.), and draw the water line BCD. Draw the line BC (fig. 22.) so that it may be parallel to the base of the triangle, and equal to CD (fig. 23.), which produce indefinitely towards H. Make BD equal to BC (fig. 23.), and draw the dotted line SD (fig. 22.). The ribband FC (fig. 21.) is to be applied to the triangle, so that it may be parallel to the base, and contained between the line MS and the dotted line SD. Let ef represent this line; then transfer the several divisions from ef to the ribband CF (fig. 21.), and number them accordingly. Again, make EF (fig. 23.) equal to LO (fig. 21.), and draw the water line FGH; make BF (fig. 22.) equal to FG (fig. 23.), and draw the dotted line SF; apply the second ribband JK to the triangle, so that the extremity K may be on the line SM, and the other extremity L on the dotted line SF, and making with SM an angle of about 62° degrees. Let kl be this line, and transfer the divisions from it to the ribband KL. In like manner make IK (fig. 23.) equal to NP (fig. 21.), and draw the water line KLM. Make BG (fig. 22.) equal to KL (fig. 23.), and draw the dotted line SG; then the ribband MN is to be applied to the triangle in such a manner that its extremities M and N may be upon the lines SM, SG respectively, and that it may make an angle of about 68 degrees with the line SM; and the divisions are to be transferred from it to the ribband MN. The same process is to be followed to divide the other ribbands, observing to apply the fourth ribband to the triangle, so that it may make an angle of 86 degrees with the line SM; the fifth ribband to make an angle of 65 degrees, and the sixth an angle of 60 degrees with the line SM.\n\nThe quantities of these angles are, however, far from being precisely fixed. Some constructors, in applying the ribbands to the triangle, make them all parallel to its base; and others vary the measures of these angles according to fancy. It may also be remarked, that a different method of dividing the base of the triangle is used by some. It is certainly proper to try different methods; and that is to be preferred which best answers the intended purpose.\n\nBeside the frames already mentioned, there are other two laid down by some constructors in the several plans, called balance frames. The after balance frame is placed at one fourth of the length of the ship before the sternpost; and the other, commonly called the loof frame, at one fourth of the ship's length aft of a perpendicular to the keel from the rabbet of the stem. Let the dotted line at X, between the fifth and sixth frames, (fig. 23.) be the place of the after balance frame in the plane of elevation. Then, in order to lay down this frame in the plane of projection, its representation must be previously drawn in the triangle. To accomplish this, draw the line SV (fig. 22.) so that the interval SV may have the same ratio to 56 (fig. 22.) that 5X has to 56 (fig. 23.) (D). Then the several points in the ribbands in the plane of projection answering to this frame are to be found by means of the triangle in the same manner as before.\n\nThe loof frame is nearly of the same dimensions as the after balance frame, or rather of a little greater capacity, in order that the centre of gravity of that part of the ship may be nearly in the plane of the midship frame. Hence the loof frame may be easily drawn in the plane of projection, and hence also the other frames in the fore body may be readily described.\n\nPROB. X. To describe the frames in the fore body.\n\nDraw the middle line of the stem AB (fig. 24.); make AC, BD each equal to half the thickness of the stem, and draw the line CD; describe also one half of the main frame CEFGH1. Let e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z be water lines at the heights of the ribbands on the main frame; also let a be the termination of the floor ribband, and b that of the breadth ribband on the stem. Divide the interval ab into three equal parts in the points c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, and draw the ribbands a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, respectively, and draw the curve Ciklmn, which will be the projection of the loof frame. Or since it is necessary that the capacity of the loof frame should be a little greater than that of the after balance frame, each of the above lines may be increased by a proportional part of itself, as one tenth or one twentieth, as may be judged proper.\n\nConstruct the triangle (fig. 25.) in the same manner as fig. 22., only observing, that as there are fewer frames in the fore than in the after body, its base will therefore be divided into fewer parts. Let there be eight frames in the fore body, then there will be eight divisions in the base of the triangle beside the extremes.\n\nLet fig. 26. represent the stem and part of the forebody in the plane of elevation, and let O be the place of the loof frame. Divide the interval 4, 5 (fig. 25.) so that 4, 5 may be to 4Z as 4, 5 to 4, 5 (fig. 26.), and draw the dotted line SZ, which will be the line denoting the loof frame in the triangle.\n\nDraw the lines AB, CD, EF, GH (fig. 26.) parallel to the keel, and whose perpendicular distances therefrom may be equal to Ca, Cc, Cd, Cb, (fig. 24.) the intersections.\n\n---\n\n(D) It is evident, from the method used to divide the base of the triangle, that this proportion does not agree exactly with the construction; the difference, however, being small, is therefore neglected in practice.\nintersections of these lines with the rabbet of the stem, namely, the points I, K, L, M will be the points of termination of the several ribbands on the stem in the plane of elevation. Divide 8 A (fig. 25.) so that 8 B, 8 C, 8 D, and 8 E, may be respectively equal to BI, DK, FL, and HM (fig. 26.), and draw the dotted lines SB, SC, SD, SE (fig. 25.). Apply the edge of a slip of card to the first ribband (fig. 24.), and mark thereon the extremities of the ribband a, E, and also the point of intersection of the loof frame. Then apply this slip of card to the triangle in such a manner that the point a may be on the dotted line SB, the point E on the line SM, and the point answering to the loof frame on the dotted line SZ; and mark upon the card the several points of intersection of the lines S1, S2, &c. Now apply the card to the ribband a E (fig. 24.) as before, and transfer the several points of division from it to the ribband. In like manner proceed with the other ribbands; and lines drawn through the corresponding points in the ribbands will be the projection of the lower part of the frames in the fore body. The projections of the top-timbers of the several frames may be taken from the half breadth plan; and hence each top-timber may be easily described.\n\nIn large ships, particularly in those of the French navy, a different method is employed to form the top-timbers in the fore body, which is as follows:\n\nLet BI (fig. 27.) be one fourth of the breadth of the ship, and draw IK parallel to AB. Take the height of the foremost frame from the plane of elevation, and lay it off from A to B; from the point B draw BH perpendicular to AB, and equal to half the length of the wing transom. Let E be the place of the breadth ribband on the main frame, and F its place on the stem at the height of the wing transom. With a radius equal to five sixths of half the greatest breadth of the ship describe the quadrant EFG (fig. 28.). Make EH equal to FG (fig. 27.), the point F being at the height of the wing transom. Through H draw HO perpendicular to EH, and intersecting the circumference in O; then draw OL parallel to HE, and EL parallel to HO. Divide EL into as many equal parts as there are frames in the fore body, including the main frame, and from these points of division draw the perpendiculars 11, 22, &c., parallel to LM. Apply a slip of card to the eighth parallel, and mark upon it the point answering to the stem, the eighth and main frames: carry this to the triangle, and place it so that the points may be on the corresponding lines. Then the points of intersection of the lines C7, C6, &c. are to be marked on the card, which is now to be applied first to the eighth parallel (fig. 27.), then to the seventh, &c., transferring the several points of division in order as before.\n\nDraw the line HO (fig. 27.); mark its length on a slip of card, and apply it to the triangle, so that it may be parallel to its bale, and its extremities one on the eighth and the other on the main frame: mark on the card the points of intersection of the several intermediate lines as before; then apply the card to HO, and transfer the divisions.\n\nThere are now three points determined through which each top-timber must pass, namely, one in the breadth ribband, one in the fifth, and one in the upper ribband. Through these curves are to be described; so as to reconcile with the lower part of the frame, and partake partly of the curvature of the eighth frame, and partly of that of the main frame, but most of that of the frame to which it is nearest: and hence the plane of projection is so far finished, that it only remains to prove the several frames by water lines.\n\nAnother method of describing the frames in the body plan is by sweeps. In this method it is necessary, in the first place, to describe the height of the breadth lines, and the rising of the floor, in the plane of elevation. The half breadth lines are next to be described in the floor plan. The main frame is then to be described by three or more sweeps, and giving it such a form as may be most suitable to the service the ship is designed for. The lower, upper, and top-timber heights of breadth, and the risings of the floor, are to be set upon the middle line in the body plan, and the several half breadths are then to be laid off on lines drawn through\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThese points perpendicular to the middle line. A mould may then be made for the main frame, and laid upon the several risings, as in whole mouldings, explained in Chapter V. with this difference, that here an under breadth sweep is described to pass through the point which limits the half breadth of the timber, the centre of which will be in the breadth line of that timber. The proper centres for all the frames being found, and the arches described, the bend mould must be so placed on the rising line of the floor, that the back of it may touch the back of the under breadth sweep. But the general practice is, to describe all the floor sweeps with compasses, as well as the under breadth sweeps, and to reconcile these two by a mould which is an arch of a circle, its radius being the same with that of the reconciling sweep by which the midship frame was formed. It is usual for all the floor sweeps to be of the same radius; and in order to find their centres a line is formed on the floor plan for the half breadth of the floor. As this line cannot be described on the surface of a ship, it is therefore only an imaginary line. Instead of it some make use of a diagonal in the body plane to limit the half breadth of the floor upon every rising line, and to erect perpendiculars at the several intersections, in the same manner as for the midship frame.\n\nAfter the sweeps are all described, recourse is had to moulds, or some such contrivance, to form the hollow of the timbers, much in the same manner as in whole moulding; and when all the timbers are formed, they must be proved by ribband and water lines, and altered, if necessary to make fair curves.\n\nThe preceding methods of describing the several planes or sections of a ship being well understood, it will be a very easy matter to construct draughts for any proposed ship: and as the above planes were described separately and independent of each other, it is therefore of little consequence which is first described. In the following application, however, the plane of elevation will be first drawn, then part of the floor plan, and lastly the body plan: and in connecting these plans the most rational and simple methods will be employed.\n\nCHAP. IV. Application of the foregoing Rules to the Construction of Ships.\n\nSECT. I.

Make bc equal to 17 feet, the perpendicular height of the top of the stem above the upper edge of the keel, and describe the stem by Prob. II. Make ad equal to 10½ feet, the height of the middle line of the wales at the stern, and ae equal to the proposed rake of the post, which may be about 2 feet: join de; and draw the line fg representing the aft-side of the post. Describe the counter and stern by Problem VI. and VII. Make bh equal to 14 feet, the top-timber height at the main frame, and ik equal to 18 feet, the height at the stern; and through the three points c, h, k, describe the curve limiting the top-timbers by Problem I. Make bd equal to 10 feet, the height of the middle line of the wales at the stern, and dh equal to 6 feet 10 inches, the height at the main frame; and the curve dh being described will represent the middle line of the wales. At the distance of 10½ inches on each side of this line draw two curves parallel thereto, and the wales will be completed in this plan. Make bl equal to 13½ feet, the height of the breadth line at the stem; am equal to 12½ feet, the height at the stern; and K+ equal to 5 feet 10 inches and 7 feet 4 inches respectively; and draw the upper breadth line lkm and lower breadth line l'm. From the line ab lay downwards the breadth of the keel, which may be about one foot, and draw the line lt parallel to ab.\n\nLet the line lr, which is the lower edge of the keel, represent also the middle line of the floor plan. Produce all the perpendiculars representing the frames: make M (fig. 31.) equal to 11 feet, the main half breadth at midships; through m (fig. 30.) draw the line mn perpendicular to ab, and make pn equal to 7½ feet, and draw the main half breadth line nmr by Problem IV. Describe also the top-timber half breadth line pqr, o being equal to 10½ feet, and form the projecting part of the stem qrst.\n\nIn order that the top-timber line may look fair on the bow, and to prevent the foremost top-timbers from being too short, it is necessary to lift or raise the sheer from the round of the bow to the stem. For this purpose the following method is usually employed: Produce the circular sheer before the stem in the plane of elevation at pleasure; then place a batton to the round of the bow in the half breadth plan, and mark on it the stations of the square timbers and the side of the stem; apply the batton to the sheer plan, and place it to the sheer of the ship, keeping the stations of the timbers on the batton well with those on the sheer plan for several timbers before dead-flat, where they will not alter; then mark the other timbers and the stem on the sheer line produced; through these points draw lines parallel to the keel, to intersect their corresponding timbers and the stem in the sheer plan: then a curve described these last points will be the sheer of the ship round the\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication the bow, lifted as required: and the heights of the timbers thus lengthened are to be transferred to the body plan as before.\n\nDraw the line AB (fig. 32.) equal to 22 feet, the whole breadth; from the middle of which draw the perpendicular CD: make CE equal to half the thickness of the pofl., and CF equal to half that of the stem, and from the points A, E, F, B, draw lines parallel to CD. Make AG, BG each equal to 14 feet, the height at the main frame, and draw the line GG parallel to AB. Make GH, GH each equal to half a foot, the difference between the main and top timber half breadths. From A and B set up the heights of the lower and upper breadth lines to I and K, and draw the straight lines IK, IK. Let CL be the rising at the main frame, and ⊕ the extremities of the floor timber. Hence, as there are now five points determined in each half of the main frame, it may be very easily described.\n\nMake CM equal to L ⊕, join M ⊕, and draw the other ribbands NO, PQ. In order, however, to simplify this operation, the rectilineal distance ⊕I was trifled, and through the points of division the lines NO, PQ were drawn parallel to the floor ribband M⊕.\n\nTake the distance bc (fig. 30.), and lay it off from F to (fig. 32.); also make Fb (fig. 32.) equal to Fa (fig. 30.); through b draw bc parallel to AB, and equal to FR (fig. 31.). In like manner take the heights of each top-timber from fig. 30. and lay them off from C towards D (fig. 32.); through these points draw lines parallel to AB, and make them equal each to each, to the corresponding half breadth lines taken from the floor-plan: Then through the several points a, c, &c. thus found, draw a line acH, which will be the projection of the top-timber line of the fore body in the body plan. Proceed in the same manner to find the top-timber line in the after body.\n\nTransfer the height of the main-breadth line on the stem bI (fig. 30.), from F to d (fig. 32.). Transfer also the heights of the lower and upper breadth lines at timber F (fig. 30.), namely, FW, FX, from F to e and f (fig. 32.) through which draw the parallels eg, fh; make them equal to FS (fig. 31.), and draw the straight line gh. In this manner proceed to lay down the portions of the extreme breadth at each frame, both in the fore and in the after body in the body plan, and draw the upper and lower breadth lines dhK, dgI in the fore body and Ki, Ii in the after body. Hence the portions of the several top-timbers contained between the top-timber and main breadth lines may be easily described. It was before remarked that their forms were partly arbitrary. The midship top-timber has generally a hollow, the form of which is left entirely to the artist, though in some ships, especially small ones, it has none. It is the common practice to make a mould for this hollow, either by a sweep or some other contrivance, which is produced considerably above the top-timber line, in a straight line or very near one. The midship top-timber is formed by this mould, which is so placed that it breaks in four with the back of the upper breadth sweep. The other top-timbers are formed by the same mould, observing to place it so that the straight part of it may be parallel to the straight part of the midship timber, and moved up or down, still keeping it in that direction till it just touches the back of the upper breadth sweep.\n\nSome constructors begin at the after timber, after the application mould is made for the midship top-timber, because they think it easier to keep the straight part of the mould parallel to this than to the midship timber; and by this means the top side is kept from winding. Others, again, make a mark upon the mould where the breadth line of the midship timber crooks it, and with the same mould they form the after timber: this will occasion the mark that was made on the mould when at the main frame to fall below the breadth line of the after timber, and therefore another mark is made at the height of the breadth line at the after timber; the straight part of the mould is then laid obliquely across the breadth lines of the top-timbers in such a manner that it may intersect the breadth line of the midship timber at one of these marks and the breadth line of the after timber at the other mark; then the several intersections of the breadth lines of the timbers are marked upon the mould; which must now be so placed in forming each timber, that the proper mark may be applied to its proper breadth, and it must be turned about so as just to touch the upper breadth sweep. Any of these methods may make a fair side, and they may be easily proved by forming another intermediate half breadth line.\n\nThe remaining parts of the frames may be described by either of the methods laid down in Problems IX. and X. In order, however, to illustrate this still farther, it is thought proper to subjoin another method of forming the intermediate frames, the facility of which will recommend it.\n\nTake FZ (fig. 30.), and lay it from F to k (fig. 32.); then describe the lower part of the foremost frame, making it more or less full according as proposed; and intersecting the ribbands in the points l, m, n. Describe also the aftermost frame a, p, q. Make αβ (fig. 30.) equal to Fr (fig. 32.), and produce it to a (fig. 31.); also draw ψδ and ζ (fig. 30.) equal to Er and Es (fig. 32.) respectively; and produce them to b and c: Make Fe, Ff, FR (fig. 31.) equal to Ml, Nm, Pn (fig. 32.) each to each. Let also ⊕h, ⊕i, ⊕k, and g, 9, m, 9u (fig. 31.) be made equal to M ⊕, NO, PQ, and Mo, Ng, Pp (fig. 32.); then through these points trace the curves aehlb, rfiuc, and riknp, and they will be the projections of the ribbands in the floor plan. Now transfer the several intervals of the frames contained between the middle line and the ribbands (fig. 31.) to the corresponding ribbands in the body plan (fig. 32.). Hence there will be five points given in each frame, namely, one at the lower breadth line, one at each ribband, and one at the keel; and consequently these frames may be easily described. In order to exemplify this, let it be required to lay down the frame E in the plane of projection. Take the interval En (fig. 31.), and lay it from M to u (fig. 32.). Lay off also Ev, Ee (fig. 31.) from N to v and from P to n (fig. 32.); then through the points F, u, v, n and the lower breadth line describe a curve, and it will be the representation of the frame E in the body plan. In like manner the other frames may be described.\n\nThe ribbands may now be transferred from the body plan to the plane of elevation, by taking the several heights of the intersection of each ribband with the frames, and laying them off on the corresponding frames in the floor plan; and if the line drawn through these points...\nApplication points make a fair curve, it is presumed that the curves of the frames are rightly laid down in the body plan.\n\nOnly one of these ribbands, namely, the first, is laid down in fig. 30. These curves may also be farther proved, by drawing water lines in the plane of elevation, and in the body plan, at equal distances from the upper edge of the keel. Then the distances between the middle line of the body plan, and the several points of intersection of these lines with the frames, are to be laid off from the middle line in the floor plan upon the corresponding frames; and if the line drawn through these points form a fair curve, the frames are truly drawn in the body plan.\n\nIn figs. 30 and 32, there are drawn four water lines at any equal distances from the keel, and from each other. These lines are then transferred from fig. 32 to fig. 31; and the lines passing through these points make fair curves.\n\nThe transoms are described by Problem VIII. It is therefore unnecessary to repeat the process. A rising line of the floor timbers is commonly drawn in the plane of elevation.\n\nAs this is intended only as an introductory example, several particulars have therefore been omitted; which, however, will be exemplified in the following section.\n\n**Sect. IV. To describe the several Plans of a Ship of War proposed to carry 80 Guns upon two Decks.**\n\nAs it is proposed in this place to show the method of describing the plans of a ship of a very considerable size, it therefore seems proper to give the dimensions of every particular part necessary in the delineation of these plans. The several plans of this ship are contained in figs 33 and 34. But as it would very much confuse the figures to have a reference to every operation, and as the former example is deemed a sufficient illustration, the letters of reference are upon these accounts omitted in the figures.\n\n**Principal Dimensions.**\n\n| Lengths | F.

Of the Sheer Draught or Plane of Elevation.\n\nDraw a straight line (fig. 33.) to represent the upper edge of the keel, erect a perpendicular on that end to the right, and from thence set off 182 feet, the length on the gun-deck, and there erect another perpendicular; that to the right is called the foremost perpendicular, and the other the after one: upon these two perpendiculars all the foremost and aftermost heights must be set off, which are expressed in the dimensions.\n\nThen set off the distance of the main frame or dead flat from the foremost perpendicular, and at that place erect a third perpendicular, which must be distinguished by the character ⊕. From dead flat the room and space of all the timbers must be set off; but it will only be necessary to erect a perpendicular at every frame timber; which in the fore body are called dead flat, A, C, E, &c. and in the after body (2), 1, 3, 5, &c.: hence the distance between the frame perpendiculars will be double the room and space expressed in the dimensions. Then set off the heights of the gun-deck afore at midship or dead flat, and abaft from the upper side of the keel; and a curve described through these three points will be the upper side of the gun-deck. Set off the thickness of the gun-deck plank below that; and another curve being drawn parallel to the former, the gun-deck will then be described at the middle line of the sheer plan.\n\nThe centre of the stem is then to be laid down by means of the table of dimensions; from which centre, with an extent equal to the nearest distance of the upper edge of the keel, describe a circle upwards: describe also another circle as much without the former as the stem is moulded. Then set off the height of the head of the stem, with the distance afore the perpendicular, and there make a point; and within that set off the moulding of the stem, and there make another point: from this last mentioned point let a line pass downwards, intersecting the perpendicular at the height of the gun-deck, and breaking in fair with the inner circle, and the after part of the stern is drawn. Draw another line from the foremost point downwards, parallel to the former, and breaking in fair with the outer circle; then the whole stem will be formed, except the after or lower end, which cannot be determined till hereafter.\n\nThe stern-post must be next formed. Set off on the upper edge of the keel a spot for the aft part of the rabbet taken from the dimensions, and from that forward set off another point at the distance of the thick-\nApplication nefs of the plank of the bottom, which is four inches and a half; and from this last-mentioned point draw a line upwards intersecting the perpendiculars at the height of the lower deck; then set up the perpendicular the height of the wing transom, and draw a level line, and where that line intersects, the line first drawn will be the aft side of the wing transom; on the upper part of the middle line set off from that place the distance of the aft side of the stern-post; set off also the distance of the after part from the rabbet on the upper edge of the keel, and a line drawn through these two points will be the aft side of the post. A line drawn parallel to the first drawn line at the distance of four inches and a half, the thickness of the plank on the bottom, will be the aft side of the rabbet; and hence the stern-post is described, except the head, which will be determined afterwards.\n\nFrom the dimensions take the several heights of the upper deck above the gun-decking, afore, at midship, and abaft, and set them off accordingly; through these points describe a curve, which will be the under side of the upper deck; describe also another curve parallel thereto, at the distance of the thickness of the plank, and the upper deck will be then represented at the middle line of the ship.\n\nSet off the height of the lower counter, at the middle line, from the upper edge of the keel, and draw a horizontal line with a pencil; then on the pencil line set off the distance the touch of the lower counter is abaft the aft side of the wing transom: from this point to that where the fore part of the rabbet of the stern-post intersects the line drawn for the upper part of the wing transom, draw a curve at pleasure, which curve will represent the lower counter at the middle line. The height of the upper counter is then to be set off from the upper edge of the keel, and a horizontal line is to be drawn as before, setting off the distance the touch of the upper counter is abaft the aft side of the wing transom; and a curve described from thence to the touch of the lower counter will form the upper counter at the middle line.\n\nBoth counters being formed at the middle line, the upper part of the stern timber above the counters is to be described as follows: On the level line drawn for the upper side of the wing transom set off the distance of the aft side of the stern timber at the middle line from the aft side of the wing transom, at the height of the top-timber line, and erect a perpendicular: then upon this perpendicular, from the upper edge of the keel, set off the height at the middle line of the top-timber line at the after side of the stern timber; through this point draw a straight line to the touch of the upper counter, and the upper part of the stern timber will be described.\n\nAs the stern rounds two ways, both up and aft, the stern timber at the side will consequently alter from that at the middle line, and therefore remains to be represented. Take the round up of the upper counter from the dimensions, and set it below the touch at the middle, and with a pencil draw a level line; take also the round aft, and set it forward from the touch on the touch line, and square it down to the pencil line last drawn, and the point of intersection will be the touch of the upper counter at the side. In the same manner find the touch of the lower counter; and a curve, similar to that at the middle line, being described from the one touch to the other, will form the upper counter at the fide.\n\nTake the round up of the wing transom, and set it off below the line before drawn for the height of the wing transom, and draw another horizontal line in pencil: then take the round aft of the wing transom, and set it forward on the upper line from the point representing the aft side of the wing transom; square it down to the lower line, and the intersection will be the touch of the wing transom; then a curve, similar to that at the middle line, being drawn from the touch of the wing transom to the touch of the lower counter at the side, will be the lower counter at the side. Draw a line from the upper counter upwards, and the whole stern timber at the fide will be represented. But as the straight line drawn for the upper part of the side timber should not be parallel to that at the middle line, its rake is therefore to be determined as follows.\n\nDraw a line at pleasure, on which set off the breadth of the stern at the upper counter; at the middle of this line set off the round aft of the upper counter, then through this point and the extremities of the stern describe a curve. Now take the breadth of the stern at the top-timber line, and through the point where that breadth will intersect the curve for the round aft of the stern draw a line parallel to that first drawn, and the distance from the line last drawn to the curve at the middle of the line is the distance that the side timber must be from the middle line at the height of the top-timber line.\n\nThe sheer is to be described, which is done by setting off the heights afore, at midships, and abaft; and a curve described through these three points will be the sheer. But in order that the sheer may correspond exactly with the dimensions laid down, it will be necessary to proceed as follows: The perpendicular representing timber dead flat being already drawn, set off from that the distances of the other frame timbers, which is double the room and space, as the frames are only every other one; and erect perpendiculars, writing the name under each: then on each of these perpendiculars set off the corresponding heights of the top-timber line taken from the table of dimensions for constructing the bodies; and through these points a curve being described, will represent the sheer of the ship or top-timber line agreeable to the dimensions.\n\nThe quarter-deck and forecastle are next to be described, which may be done by taking their respective heights and lengths from the dimensions, and describing their curves. In the same manner also, the roundhouse may be drawn. The decks being described representing their heights at the middle, it is then necessary to represent them also at the side. For this purpose take the round of the decks from the dimensions, and set them off below the lower line drawn for the middle; and a curve described both fore and aft, observing to let it be rather quicker than the former, will be the representation of the decks at the fide.\n\nThe ports come next under consideration. In the placing of them due attention must be paid, so as to preserve strength; or that they shall be disposed as not to weaken the ship in the least, which is often done by cutting off principal timbers, placing them in too large openings, having too short timbers by the side of them,\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThe frames represented by the lines already drawn must be first consulted. Then with a going rule pencil draw two curves, for the lower and upper parts of the lower deck ports, parallel to the line representing the lower deck; the distances of these lines from the deck are to be taken from the dimensions, observing, however, to add to these heights the thicknesses of the deck, as the deck line at the side represents the under part of the deck.\n\nThe foremost port is then to be described, observing to place it as far aft as to give sufficient room for the manger: the most convenient place will therefore be to put it between the frames R and T, and equally distant from each. It will then be placed in the most conspicuous point of strength, as it will have a long top-timber on the aft side and a long fourth futtock on the fore side of it. The second port may be placed in like manner between the next two frames, which will be be equally well situated for strength as the former; and by proceeding in this manner, the ports on the gun deck may also be placed, taking care to have two frames between every two ports, all fore and aft.\n\nThe upper deck ports are then to be described; and in order to dispose of them in the strongest situation possible, they must be placed over the middle between the gun-deck ports, so that every frame in the ship will run up to the top of the side, by their coming between a gun and upper deck port; and every port will be between the frames, which will in a great measure contribute towards the strength of the ship. With regard to the ports on the quarter deck, it is not of such material consequence if they cut the head of the frame, as in placing them the situation of the dead eyes must be considered, placing a port where there is a vacancy between the dead eyes large enough to admit of one; observing always to place them as nearly as possible at equal distances from each other; and where it happens that they do not fall in the wake of a frame, then that frame must by all means be carried up to the top of the side.\n\nThe necessary length of the round house being determined in the dimensions, it may be let off; observing, however, to let it be no longer than is just sufficient for the necessary accommodations, as the shorter the round-house the works abaft may be kept lower, and a low snug stern is always accounted the handsomest. Then let off the round of the deck at the foremost end, below the line drawn; the deck at the side may be described by another curve drawn quite aft. Now, from the point for the round of the deck to the stern-timber, draw a curve parallel to the top-timber line, and that will be the extreme height of the top of the side abaft, which height continues to range fair along to the foremost end of the round-house, and at that place may have a fall about 14 inches, which may be turned off with a drift scroll. At the fore part of the quarter-deck, the topside may have a rise of 14 inches, which may also be turned off with a scroll. But as the raising of the topside only 14 inches at that place will not be sufficient to unite with the heights abaft, it will therefore be necessary to raise 14 inches more upon that, and break it off with a scroll inverted on the first scroll, and continue these two lines, parallel to the top timber line, to the distance of about seven feet aft. At the foremost end of the round-house, there is a break of 14 inches already mentioned; and in order to make that part uniform with the breaks at the foremost end of the quarter-deck, there must be set down 14 inches more below the former; and at these two heights continue two curves parallel to the top-timber line, from the aft part of the stern to the ends of the two curves already drawn at the foremost end of the quarter-deck. If they should happen not to break in fair with them, they must be turned off with a round; but to make them appear more handsome, the lower line may be turned off with a scroll. These lines being drawn will represent the upper edges of the rails.\n\nThe height of the top side at the fore part of the ship must next be considered; which, in order to give proper height for the forecastle, must have a rise there of 14 inches, the break being at the after end of the forecastle, and turned off as before. But as this part of the ship is still considerably lower than the after part, it will be necessary to give another of eight inches upon the former, and turn it off with a scroll inverted. Hence this part of the ship will appear more uniform to the after part.\n\nThe finishing parts, namely the wales, stern, head, rails, &c. remain to be described. The wales may be first drawn; and as the strength of the ship depends very much on the right placing of them, great care must therefore be taken that they may be as little as possible wounded by the lower deck ports, and so placed that the lower deck bolts shall bolt in them, and also that they come as near as possible on the broadest part of the ship. In the first place, therefore, the height of breadth lines must be chosen for our guide. These heights of breadth are to be taken from the dimensions, and set off on the respective frames, and curves drawn through these points will be the upper and lower heights of breadth lines. The height of the wales may be now determined; which in general is in such a manner that the upper height of breadth line comes about six inches below their upper edge, and the wales are then placed right upon the breadth lines. Take the heights and breadths of the wales afore, at midships, and abaft, from the table of dimensions; draw curves through the points thus found, and the wales will be represented.\n\nThe channel wales are then to be described. They are principally intended to strengthen the top side, and must be placed between the lower and upper deck ports; and the lower end of them at midships should be placed as low as possible, in order to prevent them from being cut by the upper deck ports afore and abaft. Take their heights and breadths from the dimensions; lay them off, and describe curves through the corresponding points, and the channel wales will be represented.\n\nLay off the dimensions of the waiste rail found in the table; and through the points draw a line parallel to the top timber line all fore and aft. This rail terminates the lower part of the paint work on the top side, as all the work above this rail is generally painted, and the work of the top side below it payed with a varnish, except the main wales, which are always payed with pitch.\n\nTake the draught of water from the dimensions, and draw the load water-line, which is always done in green. Divide the distance between the load water-line and the upper edge of the keel into five equal parts, and through these points draw four more water-lines.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nSet off the centres of the masts on the gun-deck; their rake may likewise be taken from the dimensions. Set off also the centre of the bowsprit, letting it be four feet from the deck at the after part of the stem, which will give sufficient height for a light and airy figure.\n\nDraw the knight-heads so as to be sufficiently high above the bowsprit to admit of a chock between them for the better security of the bowsprit. The timber heads may also be drawn above the forecastle, observing to place the most convenient for the timbers of the frame, being those which come over the upper deck ports, as they may be allowed long enough to form handsome heads. There should be one placed abaft the cat-head, to which the foremost block is to be bolted, and there may be two ports on the forecastle formed by them, and placed where it is most convenient to the dead eyes.\n\nDescribe the channels, taking their lengths and thicknesses from the dimensions, and place their upper edges well with the lower edge of the sheer rail. The dead eyes may then be drawn, observing to place them in such a manner that the chains may not interfere with the ports; and the preventer plates must all be placed on the channel wales, letting them be of such a length that the preventer bolt at each end may bolt on each edge of the channel wales. It must also be observed to give each of the chains and preventer plates a proper rake, that is, to let them lie in the direction of the shrouds, which may be done in the following manner: Produce the mast upwards, upon which fet off the length of the mast to the lower part of the head; these straight lines drawn from that point through the centre of each dead eye will give the direction of the chains and preventer braces.\n\nThe fenders may be then drawn, observing to place them right abreast of the main hatchway, in order to prevent the ship's side from being hurt by whatever may be hoisted on board. The proper place for them will therefore be at timber 3; and the distance between them may be regulated by the distance between the ports. The chest tree may also be drawn, which must be placed at a proper distance abaft the foremost, for the convenience of hauling home the fore tack. It may therefore be drawn at the aft side of timber C from the top of the side down to the upper edge of the channel wales; and the fenders may reach from the top of the side down to the upper edge of the main wales. As the fenders and chest-tree are on the outside of the planks, wales, &c., the lines representing the wales, &c., should not be drawn through them.\n\nDraw the steps on the side, which must be at the fore part of the main drift or break, making them as long as the distance between the upper and lower deck ports will admit of. They may be about five inches in width, and five inches deep, and continued from the top of the side down to the middle of the main wales.\n\nIn order to describe the head, the height of the beakhead must be first determined, which may be about two feet above the upper deck. At that place draw a horizontal line, upon which fet off the length of the beakhead, which may be 7½ feet abaft the fore part of the stem, and from thence square a line up to the forecastle deck; which line will represent the aft part of the beakhead, and will likewise terminate the foremost end of the forecastle. The length of the head may now be determined, which by the proportions will be found to be 15 feet six inches from the fore part of the stem. Set off from the fore part of the stem, and erect a perpendicular, which will be the utmost limits of the figure forward; then take the breadth of the figure from the proportions, which is four feet four inches, and fet it off forward; and another perpendicular being drawn will show the utmost extent of the hair bracket forward, or aft part of the figure. Then draw the lower cheek, letting the upper edge be well with the upper edge of the main wales, and the after end ranging well with the beak-head line; fet off the depth of it on the stem; which is about 11 inches, and let a curved line pass from the after end through the point on the stem, and to break in fair with the perpendicular first drawn for the length of the head, the fore part of the curve will then represent the position of the figure.\n\nThe upper cheek may next be drawn; but, in order to know the exact place of it on the stem, the place of the main rail must first be fet off on the stem, the upper edge of which may be kept on a level with the beakhead; then fetting off the depth of it below that, the place for the upper cheek may be determined, letting it be exactly in the middle between that and the lower cheek; then, by drawing curves for the upper and lower edges of the cheek from the after end parallel to the lower cheek, to break in fair with the perpendicular, drawn for the back of the figure; then the upper cheek will be formed. The upper part may run in a serpentine as high as where the shoulder of the figure is supposed to come, at which place it may be turned off with a scroll. The distance from the scroll to the heel of the figure is called the hair bracket.\n\nThe head of the block may be formed by continuing the line at the breast round to the top of the hair-bracket, observing to keep the top of it about six inches clear of the under side of the bowsprit.\n\nHaving the distance fet off on the stem for placing the main rail, it may next be described, keeping the bag of it as level as possible for the convenience of the gratings, and letting the foremost end rise gradually according to the rise of the upper cheek and hair bracket, and may turn off on the round of the scroll before drawn for the hair-bracket. To form the after end, fet off the size of the head of the rail abaft the beak-head line, and erect a perpendicular; then describe the arch of a circle from that perpendicular, to break in fair with the lower side of the rail in the middle, and also another from the beak-head perpendicular, to break in fair with the upper side of the rail at the middle, observing to continue the head of it sufficiently high to range with the timber heads above the forecastle.\n\nThe head timbers are next to be drawn, placing the stem-timber its own thickness abaft the stem, and the foremost must be placed so that the fore side may be up and down with the heel of the block or figure, which has not yet been fet off. Take therefore the distance from the breast to the heel on a square which is seven feet, and erect a perpendicular from the lower part of the lower cheek to the lower part of the upper cheek; which perpendicular will terminate the foremost end of the lower cheek and the heel of the figure, and will also terminate the lower end of the hair-bracket; then, by continuing the same perpendicular from the upper part of the\nApplication the lower deck to the under part of the main-rail, the fore-side of the foremost head timber will be described; and by setting off its thickness aft, the other side may be drawn. The middle head timber may be spaced between the two former ones; and there may also be one timber placed abaft the stem, at a distance from the stem, equal to that between the others, and the lower end of it may slope on the upper edge of the lower rail.\n\nTo describe the middle and lower rails, divide the distance between the lower part of the main rail and the upper part of the upper cheek equally at every head timber; and curves being described through these points will form the middle and lower rails. The after end of the lower rail must terminate at the after edge of the after head timber.\n\nThe cat-head ought to be represented in such a manner as to come against the aft side of the head of the main rail, to rake forward four inches in a foot, and to steep up 5½ inches in a foot, and about one foot five inches square. The lower part of it comes on the plank of the deck at the side, and the supporter under it must form a fair curve to break in with the after end of the middle rail.\n\nThe hawse holes must come between the cheeks, which is the most convenient place for them; but their place fore and aft cannot be exactly determined until they are laid down in the half-breadth plan.\n\nThe knee of the head is to project from the breast of the figure about two inches; and particular care must be taken that in forming it downwards it be not too full, as it is then liable to rub the cable very much: it may therefore have no more substance under the lower cheek at the heel of the figure than is just sufficient to admit of the bobstay holes, and may be 3½ feet distant from the stem at the load water-line, making it run in an agreeable fer-pentine line from the breast down to the third water line, where it may be 1½ feet from the stem. By continuing the same line downwards, keeping it more distant from the stem as it comes down, the gripe will be formed. The lower part of it must break in fair with the under part of the false keel; and the breadth of the gripe at the broadest place will be found by the proportions to be 4½ feet. As the aft part of the gripe is terminated by the fore foot, or foremost end of the keel, it will now be proper to finish that part as follows: From the line representing the upper edge of the keel set down the depth of the keel, through which draw a line parallel to the former, and it will be the lower edge of the keel. From that point, where the aft side of the stem is distant from the upper edge of the keel by a quantity equal to the breadth of the keel at midships, erect a perpendicular, which will limit the foremost end of the keel; and the after or lower end of the stem may be represented by setting off the length of the scarf from the foremost end of the keel, which may be six feet. Set down from the line representing the lower edge of the keel the thickness of the false keel, which is seven inches; and a line drawn through that point parallel to the lower edge of the keel will be the under edge of the false keel, the foremost end of which may be three inches afore the foremost end of the main keel.\n\nThe head being now finished, proceed next to the stern, the side and middle timbers of which are already drawn. From the side timber set off forward 14 feet, the length of gallery, and draw a pencil line parallel to the side timber; draw also a line to intersect the touch of the upper counter at the side, producing it forwards to the parallel to the sheer as far as the pencil line first drawn; and this line will represent the upper edge of the gallery rim. From which set down eight inches, the breadth of the gallery rail, and draw the lower edge of the rail. At the distance of eight inches from the fore-side of the side timber draw a line parallel thereto; and from the point of intersection of this line with the upper edge of the gallery rim, draw a curve to the middle timber parallel to the touches of the upper counter, which line will represent the upper edge of the upper counter rail as it appears on the sheer draught. The lower edge of this rail may be formed by setting off its depth from the upper edge. In the same manner the lower counter rail may be described: then take the distance between that and the upper counter rail, and set it off below the rim rail; and hence the rail that comes to the lower floor may be drawn, keeping it parallel to the rim rail. Underneath that, the lower finishing may be formed, making it as light and agreeable as possible.\n\nSet off from the middle timber on the end of the quarter-deck the projection of the balcony, which may be about two feet, and draw a line with a pencil parallel to the middle timber. On this line set off a point 1½ inches below the under side of the quarter-deck, from which draw a curve to the side timber parallel to the upper counter rail, which curve will represent the lower side of the foot space rail of the balcony as it appears in the sheer draught.\n\nTake the distance between the point of intersection of the upper edge of the upper counter with the middle line, and the point of intersection of the under side of the foot space rail with the middle line, which set up on a perpendicular from the upper edge of the rim rail at the foremost end. Through this point draw a line parallel to the rim rail to intersect the lower part of the foot space rail, and this line will represent the lower edge of the rail that comes to the middle stool, and will answer to the foot space rail. Then between this line and the rim rail three lights or rafters may be drawn, having a muntin or pillar between each light of about 14 inches broad, and the lower gallery will be finished. Set off the depth of the middle stool rail above the line already drawn for the lower edge, and the upper edge may be drawn. Then set off the same depth above the curve drawn for the lower edge of the foot space rail, and the upper edge of that rail may then be drawn.\n\nThe quarter-piece must be next described, the heel of which must step on the after end of the middle stool. Draw a line with a pencil parallel to the middle timber, and at a distance therefrom, equal to the projection of the balcony. Upon this line set up from the round-house deck the height of the upper part of the stern or staff rail, which may be four feet above the deck. At that height draw with a pencil a horizontal line, and from its intersection with the line first drawn describe a curve to the middle stool rail, observing to make the lower part of this curve run nearly parallel to the side timber, and the lower part about three inches abaft the side timber; and this curve will represent the aft side of the quarter-piece at the outside. There set off the thicknesses\nApplication of the quarter-piece, which is one foot six inches before the curve already drawn; and another curve being described parallel to it from the lower part to the construction of top of the sheer, and the quarter-piece at the outside will be represented. On the horizontal line drawn for the upper part of the taff-rail let off forward the thicknesses of the taff-rail, which is one foot; then draw a curve down to the head of the quarter-piece parallel to the first, and that part of the taff-rail will be described. Instead of a fair curve, it is customary to form the upper part of the taff-rail with one or two breaks, and their curves inverted. Either way may, however, be used according to fancy.\n\nSet off the depth of the taff-rail, which may be about 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet, on the line drawn for the projection; from the upper part, and from this point, describe a curve as low as the heel of the quarter-piece, and about five inches abaft it at that place; observing to make it run nearly parallel to the after edge of the quarter-piece; and the after part of the quarter-piece, which comes nearest to the side, will be represented.\n\nSet up on the line drawn for the projection of the balcony the height of the upper part of the balcony or breast rail, which is 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet from the deck; set off the thickness of the rail below that, and describe the balcony, keeping it parallel to the foot space rail, and terminating it at the line drawn for the after part of the quarter-piece nearest the side; and the whole balcony will then be represented.\n\nThe upper gallery is then to be described. In order to this, its length must be determined, which may be 11 feet. Set off this distance from the side timber forward with the sheer; and at this point draw a line parallel to the side timber, which line will represent the fore part of the gallery. Then take the distance between the upper part of the foot space rail and the upper part of the breast rail on a perpendicular, and let it off on a perpendicular from the upper part of the middle stool rail on the line drawn for the fore part of the gallery, from which to the fore part of the quarter-piece draw a straight line parallel to the rail below, which line will be the upper edge of the upper rim rail; and its thickness being set off, the lower edge may also be drawn. From the upper edge of that rail let up an extent equal to the distance between the lower rim rail and middle stool rail, and describe the upper rim rail, the after end of which will be determined by the quarter-piece, and the fore end by the line for the length of the gallery. There may be three falsies drawn between these two rails as before; and hence the upper gallery will be formed.\n\nThe upper finishing should be next drawn, the length of which may be 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) foot less than the upper gallery. Draw a line parallel to the rake of the stern for the fore end of it, and let the upper part of the top side be the upper part of the upper rail, from which set down three inches for the thickness of the rail, and describe it. Describe also another rail of the same length and thickness as the former, and eight inches below; from the end of which a serpentine line may be drawn down to the upper stool rail, and the upper finishing will be completed.\n\nThe stern being now finished, the rudder only remains to be drawn. The breadth of the rudder at the lower part is to be determined from the proportions, and set off from the line representing the aft part of the Application stern-post; which line also represents the fore part of the rudder. Then determine on the lower hance, letting it be no higher than is just sufficient, which may be about one foot above the load water-line, and set off its breadth at that place taken from the proportions. Then a line drawn from thence to the breadth set off at the lower part will be the aft side of the rudder below the lower hance. There may also be another hance about the height of the lower deck. The use of these breaks or hances is to reduce the breadth as it rises toward the head. The aft part may be drawn above the lower hance, the break at the lower hance being about ten inches, and the break at the upper hance six inches.—The back may be then drawn. It is of elm, about four inches thick on the aft part. That thickness being set off, and a line drawn from the lower hance to the lower end, will represent the back. The head of the rudder should be as high as to receive a tiller above the upper deck. Therefore set off the size of the head above the upper deck, and draw a line from thence to the break at the upper hance, and the aft part of the rudder will be represented all the way up. The bearding should be drawn, by setting off the breadth of it at the keel from the fore side of the rudder, which may be nine inches. Set off also the breadth at the head of the wing transom, which may be a foot. Then a line being drawn through these two points, from the lower part of the rudder to about a foot above the wing transom, and the bearding will be represented. As the bearding is a very nice point, and the working of the rudder depending very much upon it, it should always be very particularly considered. It has been customary to beard the rudder to a sharp edge at the middle line, by which the main piece is reduced more than necessary. The rudder should, however, be bearded from the side of the pintles, and the fore side made to the form of the pintles.\n\nThe pintles and braces may next be drawn. In order to which determine the place of the upper one, which must be so disposed that the straps shall come round the head of the standard, which is against the head of the stern-post on the gun-deck, and meet at the middle line. By this means there is double security both to the brace and standard. To obtain those advantages, it must therefore be placed about four inches above the wing transom; the second must be placed just below the gun-deck so as to bolt in the middle of the deck transom, and the rest may be spaced equally between the lower one, which may be about six inches above the upper edge of the keel. The number of them is generally seven pair upon this class of ships; but the number may be regulated by the distance between the second and upper one, making the distance between the rest nearly the same. The length of all the braces will be found by setting off the length of the lower one, which may be eight feet afore the back of the stern-post, and also the length of the third, which is four feet and a half afore the back of the stern-post; and a line drawn from the one extremity to the other will limit the intermediate ones, as will appear on the sheer draught. The braces will seem to diminish in length very much as they go up; but when measured or viewed on the shape of the body, they will be nearly of an equal length. The length of the straps of the pintles which come\nII. Of the half-breadth and body plans.—The half-breadth plan must be first drawn. Then produce the lower edge of the keel both ways, and let it also represent the middle line of the half-breadth plan. Produce all the frames downwards, and also the fore and after perpendiculars. Then from the place in the sheer-plan, where the height of breadth-lines intersect the item, square down to the middle line the fore and aft part of the rabbet and the fore part of the stem. Take from the dimensions what the item is fitted at that place, and set off half of it from the middle line in the half-breadth plan, through which draw a line parallel to the middle line through the three lines squared down, and the half breadth of the stem will be represented in the half-breadth plan. Take the thickness of the plank of the bottom which is 4½ inches, and describe the rabbet of the stem in the half-breadth plan.\n\nFrom the points of intersection of the height of breadth lines with the counter timber at the side, and with the counter timber at the middle line, draw lines perpendicular to the middle line of the half-breadth plan, from which set off the half breadth of the counter on the line first drawn; and from this point to the intersection of the line last drawn, with the middle line draw a curve, and the half breadth of the counter will be represented at the height of breadth, which will be the broadest part of the stern.\n\nTake the main half breadth of timber dead flat from the dimensions, and lay it off from the middle line on dead flat in the half-breadth plan. Take also from the dimensions the main half breadth of every timber, and set off each from the middle line on the corresponding timbers in the half-breadth plan. Then a curve drawn from the end of the line representing the half breadth of the counter through all the points, set off on the timbers, and terminating at the aft part of the stern, will be the main half-breadth line. Take from the dimensions the top-timber half breadth, and describe the top-timber half-breadth line in the half-breadth plan, in the same manner as the main half-breadth line.\n\nTake from the dimensions the half breadth of the rising, and set it off from the middle line on the corresponding timbers in the half-breadth plan, observing, where the word outside is expressed in the tables, the half breadth for that timber must be set off above or on the outside of the middle line. Then a curve drawn through these points will be the half breadth of rising in the half-breadth plan.\n\nIt will now be necessary to proceed to the body plan. Draw a horizontal line (fig. 35.), which is called the base line, from the right hand extremity of which erect a perpendicular. Then set off on the base line the main half breadth at dead flat, and erect another perpendicular, and from that set off the main half breadth again, and erect a third perpendicular. The first perpendicular, as already observed, is called the side line of the fore body; the second the middle line; and the third the side line of the after body.\n\nTake from the dimensions the heights of the diagonals up the middle line, and set them from the base up the middle line in the body plan. Take also their distances from the middle line on the base, and set them off. Set off also their heights up the side lines, and draw the diagonals. Then take from the sheer plan the heights of the lower height of breadth line, and set them off upon the middle line in the body plan; through these points lines are to be drawn parallel to the base, and terminating at the side lines. In like manner proceed with the upper height of breadth line.\n\nThe rising is next to be set off on the body plan; it must, however, be first described in the sheer plan; take, therefore, the heights from the dimensions, and set them off on the corresponding timbers in the sheer plan, and a curve described through these points will be the rising line in the sheer plan. Then take from the dimensions the rising heights of dead flat. Set it off in the body plan, and draw a horizontal line. Now take all the rising heights from the sheer plan, and set them off in the body plan from the line drawn for the rising height of dead flat, and draw horizontal lines through these points. Take from the half-breadth plan the half breadths of the rising, and set them off from the middle line in the body plan, and the centres of the floor sweeps of the corresponding timbers will be obtained.\n\nFrom the half-breadth plan take the main half-breadth lines, and set them off from the middle line in the body plan on the corresponding lines before drawn for the lower height of breadth; and from the extremities of these lines set off towards the middle line the lengths of the lower breadth sweeps respectively.\n\nTake from the dimensions the distance of each frame from the middle line on the diagonals, and set them off from the middle line on their respective diagonal lines. Now these distances being set off, and the lower breadth and floor sweeps described, the shape of the frames below the breadth line may easily be drawn as follows: Place one point of a compass in the distance set off for the length of the lower breadth sweep, and extend the other to the point which terminates the breadth, and describe an arch of a circle downwards, which will intersect the points set off on the upper diagonal lines, letting it pass as low as convenient. Then fix one point of the compasses in the centre of the floor sweep, and extend the other to the point set off on the fourth diagonal, which is the floor head; and describe a circle to intersect as many of the points set off on the diagonals as it will. Then draw a curve from the back of the lower breadth sweep, through the points on the diagonals, to the back of the floor sweep. Describe also another curve from the back of the floor sweep through the points on the lower diagonals, and terminating at the upper part of the rabbet of the keel, and that part of the frame below the breadth will be formed. In like manner describe the other frames.\n\nThrough the extremities of the frames at the lower height of breadth draw lines parallel to the middle line, and terminating at the upper height of breadth line, and from thence set off the upper breadth sweeps; now fix one point of the compass in the centres of the upper breadth sweeps successively, and the other point to the extremities of the frames, and describe circles upwards. Then from the sheer plan take off the heights of the top-timber lines, and set them off in the body plan, drawing horizontal lines; upon which set off the top-timber half breadths taken from the corresponding timbers.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication of the foregoing Rules to the Construction of Ships.\n\nThe upper end of the timbers may be determined by taking the several heights of the upper part of the top side above the top-timber line, and letting them off above the top-timber line on the corresponding timbers in the body plan. The lower parts of the timbers are ended at the rabbet of the keel as follows: With an extent of four inches and a half, the thickness of the bottom, and one leg of the compasses at the place where the line for the thickness of the keel intersects the base line; with the other leg describe an arch to intersect the keel line and the base. Then fix one point at the intersection of the arch and keel, and from the point of intersection of the keel and base describe another arch to intersect the former. Then from the intersection of these arches draw one straight line to the intersection of the keel and base, and another to the intersection of the lower arch and the keel, and the rabbet of the keel will be described at the main frame. All the timbers in the middle part of the ship which have no rising terminate at the intersection of the upper edge of the rabbet with the base line; but the lower part of the timbers, having a rising, end in the centre of the rabbet, that is, where the two circles intersect. Those timbers which are near the after end of the keel must be ended by setting off the half breadth of the keel at the port in the half-breadth plan, and describe the tapering of the keel. Then at the corresponding timbers take off the half breadth of the keel; set it off in the body plan, and describe the rabbet as before, letting every timber end where the two circles for its respective rabbet intersect.\n\nTo describe the side counter or stern timber, take the height of the wing transom, the lower counter, upper counter, and top-timber line at the side; from the sheer plan transfer them to the body plan, and through these points draw horizontal lines. Divide the distance between the wing transom and lower counter into three equal parts, and through the two points of division draw two horizontal lines. Draw also a horizontal line equidistant from the upper counter and the top-timber line in the sheer plan, and transfer them to the body plan.\n\nNow, from the point of intersection of the aft side of the stern timber at the side, with the wing transom at the side in the sheer plan, draw a line perpendicular to the middle line in the half-breadth plan. Draw also perpendicular lines from the points where the upper and lower transoms touch the stern-post; from the points of intersection of the stern timber with the two horizontal lines drawn between, and from the intersection of the stern timber with the horizontal line drawn between the upper counter and top-timber line. Then curves must be formed in the half-breadth plan for the shape of the body at each of these heights. In order to which, begin with the horizontal or level line representing the height of the wing transom in the body plan. Lay a slip of paper to that line, and mark on it the middle line and the timbers 37, 35, 33, and 29; transfer the slip to the half-breadth plan, placing the point marked on it for the middle line exactly on the middle in the half-breadth plan, and set off the half breadths on the corresponding timbers 37, 35, 33, and 29, and describe a curve through these points, and to intersect the perpendicular drawn from the sheer plan. In like manner proceed with the horizontal lines at the heights of the counters, between the lower counter and wing transom, above the upper counter and top-timber line; and from the intersections of the curve drawn in the half-breadth plan, with the perpendicular lines drawn from the sheer plan, take the distances to the middle line, and set them off on the corresponding lines in the body plan; then a curve described through the several points thus set off will be the representative of the stern timber.\n\nThe round-up of the wing transom, upper and lower counter, may be taken from the sheer draught, and set off at the middle line above their respective level lines in the body plan, by which the round-up of each may be drawn. The round aft of the wing transom may also be taken from the sheer plan, and set off at the middle line, abaft the perpendicular for the wing transom in the half-breadth plan, whence the round aft of the wing transom may be described.\n\nThe after body being now finished, it remains to form the fore body; but as the operation is nearly the same in both, a repetition is therefore unnecessary, except in those parts which require a different process.\n\nThe foremost timbers end on the stem, and consequently the method of describing the ending of them differs from that used for the timbers used in the after body. Draw a line in the body plan parallel to the middle line, at a distance equal to the half of what the stem is sided. In the sheer plan take the height of the point of intersection of the lower part of the rabbet of the stem with the timber which is required to be ended, and set it off on the line before drawn in the body plan. Then take the extent between the points of intersection of the timber with the lower and upper parts of the rabbet, and with one leg of the compasses at the extremity of the distance laid off in the body plan describe a circle, and the timbers may then pass over the back of this circle. Now, by applying a small-square to the timber, and letting the back of it intersect the point set off for the lower part of the rabbet, the lower part of the rabbet and the ending of the timbers will be described.\n\nThe foremost timbers differ also very much at the head from those in the after body: For since the ship carries her breadth so far forward at the top-timber line, it therefore occasions the two foremost frames to fall out at the head beyond the breadth, whence they are called knuckle timbers. They are thus described: The height of the top-timber line being set off in the body plan, set off on it the top half breadth taken from the half-breadth plan, and at that place draw a perpendicular; then from the sheer plan take the height of the top of the side, and set it off on the perpendicular in the body plan: Take also the breadth of the rail at the top-timber line in the sheer plan, and set it off below the top-timber line at the perpendicular line in the body plan, and the straight part of the knuckle timber to be drawn will be determined. Then from the last-mentioned point set off describe a curve through the points set off for the timber down to the upper breadth, and the whole knuckle timber will be formed. It will hence\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication hence be seen that those timbers forward will fall out beyond the main breadth with a hollow, contrary to the rest of the top side, which falls within the main breadth with a hollow.\n\nThe fore and after bodies being now formed, the water lines must next be described in the half-breadth plan, in order to prove the fairness of the bodies. In this draught the water lines are all represented parallel to the keel; their heights may, therefore, be taken from the sheer plan, and transferred to the body plan, drawing horizontal lines, and the water lines will be represented in the body plan. In ships that draw more water abaft than afore, the water lines will not be parallel to the keel; in this case, the heights must be taken at every timber in the sheer plan, and set off on their corresponding timbers in the body plan; and curves being described through the several points, will represent the water lines in the body plan.\n\nTake the distances from the middle line to the points where the water lines intersect the different timbers in the body plan, and set them off on their corresponding timbers in the half-breadth plan. From the points where the water lines in the sheer plan intersect the aft part of the rabbet of the stempost draw perpendiculars to the middle line of the half-breadth plan, and upon these perpendiculars set off from the middle line the half thickness of the stempost at its corresponding water line; which may be taken from the body plan, by setting off the size of the post at the head and the keel, and drawing a line for the tapering of it; and where the line so drawn intersects the water lines, that will be the half thickness required; then take an extent in the compasses equal to the thickness of the plank, and fix one point where the half thickness of the post intersects the perpendicular, and with the other describe a circle, from the back of which the water lines may pass through their respective points set off, and end at the fore part of the half-breadth plan, proceeding in the same manner as with the after part. A line drawn from the water line to the point set off for the half thickness of the post will represent the aft part of the rabbet of the post; and in like manner the rabbet of the stem may be represented. The water-lines being all described, it will be seen if the body is fair; and if the timbers require any alteration, it should be complied with.\n\nThe cant-timbers of the after body may next be described in the half-breadth plan; in order to which the cant of the fashion-piece must first be represented. Having therefore the round aft of the wing transom represented in the half-breadth plan, and also the shape of a level line at the height of the wing transom; then set off the breadth of the wing transom at the end, which is one foot four inches, and that will be the place where the head of the fashion-piece will come: now to determine the cant of it, the shape of the body must be considered; as it must be canted in such a manner as to preserve as great a straightness as is possible for the shape of the timber, by which means the timber will be much stronger than if it were crooked; the cant must also be considered, in order to let the timber have as little bevelling as possible. Let, therefore, the heel of the timber be set off on the middle line, two feet afore timber 35; and then drawing a line from thence to the point set off on the level line for the wing transom, the cant of the fashion-piece will be described, and will be found situated in the best manner possible to answer the before mentioned purposes.\n\nThe cant of the fashion-piece being represented, the cant of the other timbers may now be easily determined. Let timber 29 be the foremost cant timber in the after body, and with a pencil draw timber 28; then observe how many frames there are between timber 28 and the fashion-piece, which will be found to be nine, namely, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37. Now divide the distance between timber 28 and the fashion-piece on the middle line into 10 equal parts: Divide also the corresponding portion of the main half-breadth lines into the same number of equal parts; and straight lines joining the corresponding points at the middle line with those in the half-breadth line will represent the cant timbers in the after body.\n\nThe line drawn for the cant of the fashion-piece represents the aft side of it, which comes to the end of the transoms; but in order to help the conversion with regard to the lower transoms, there may be two more fashion-pieces abaft the former; therefore the foremost fashion-piece, or that which is already described in the half-breadth plan, may only take the ends of the three upper transoms, which are, the wing, filling, and deck: the middle fashion-piece may take the four next, and the after fashion-piece the lower ones; therefore let off in the half-breadth plan the siding of the middle and after fashion-piece, which may be 12 inches each; then by drawing lines parallel to the foremost fashion-piece, at the aforesaid distance from each other, the middle and after fashion-piece will be represented in the half-breadth plan.\n\nThe fashion-piece and transoms yet remain to be represented in the sheer plan; in order to which, let the number of transoms be determined, which, for so large a buttock, may be seven below the deck transom: draw them with a pencil, beginning with the wing, the upper side of which is represented by a level line at its height; set off its fiding below that, and draw a level line for the lower edge. The filling transom follows; which is merely for the purpose of filling the vacancy between the under edge of the wing and the upper part of the deck plank: it may therefore be represented by drawing two level lines for the upper and lower edge, leaving about two inches between the upper edge and lower edge of the wing transom, and four inches between the lower edge of the gun-deck plank; then the deck transom must be governed by the gun-deck, letting the under side of the gun-deck plank represent the upper side of it, and setting off its fiding below that; the under edge may also be drawn: the transoms below the deck may all be fided equally, which may be 11 inches; they must also have a sufficient distance between to admit the circulation of the air to preserve them, which may be about three inches.\n\nThe transoms being now drawn with a pencil, the fashion-piece must next be described in the sheer plan, by which the length of the transoms as they appear in that plan will be determined. As the foremost fashion-piece reaches above the upper transom, it may therefore be first described: in order to which, draw a sufficient number of level lines in the sheer plan; or, as the water lines are level, draw therefore one line between the upper water line and the wing transom, and one above the\nApplication the wing transom at the intended height of the head of the fathom-piece, which may be about five feet; then take the height of these two level lines, and transfer them to the body plan; and take off two or three timbers and run them in the half-breadth plan, in the same manner as the water lines were done; then from the point where the line drawn for the cant of the fathom-piece, in the half-breadth plan, intersects the level line drawn for the head of the fathom-piece, draw up a perpendicular to the said line in the sheer plan, making a point. Again, from the intersection of the cant line, with the level line for the wing transom in the half-breadth plan, draw a perpendicular to the wing transom in the sheer plan. Also draw perpendiculars from the points where the cant line in the half-breadth plan intersects the level line below the wing transom, and also the water lines to the corresponding lines in the sheer plan; then a curve described through these points will be the representation of the foremost fathom-piece in the sheer plan. In the same manner the middle and after fathom-pieces may be described; observing to let the middle one run up no higher than the under part of the deck transom, and the after to the under side of the fourth transom under the deck. The transoms may now be drawn with ink, as their lengths are limited by the fathom-pieces.\n\nNeither the head nor the foreside of the sternpost are yet described; take, therefore, from the dimensions, the breadth of the post on the keel, and set it off on the upper edge of the keel from the aft side of post. The head of the post must next be determined, which must just be high enough to admit of the helm-post transom and the tiller coming between it and the upper deck beam; the height therefore that is necessary will be one foot nine inches above the wing transom. Now draw a level line at that height, upon which set off the breadth of the sternpost at that place, taken from the dimensions, and a line drawn from thence to the point set off on the keel will be the foreside of the sternpost; observing, however, not to draw the line through the transoms, as it will only appear between them. The inner post may be drawn, by setting off its thickness forward from the sternpost, and drawing a straight line as before, continuing it no higher than the under side of the wing transom.\n\nThe cant timbers in the after body being described, together with the parts dependent on them, those in the fore body may be next formed; in order to which, the foremost and aftermost cant timbers must be first determined, and also the cant of the foremost ones. The foremost cant timber will extend so far forward as to be named $W$; the cant on the middle line may be one foot four inches afore square timber $W$, and on the main half breadth line one foot nine inches afore timber $Y$; in which situation the line may be drawn for the cant; the aftermost may be timber $Q$. The cant timbers may now be described in the same manner as those in the after body, namely, by spacing them equally between the cant timber $W$ and the square timber $P$, both on the main half-breadth, and middle lines, and drawing straight lines between the corresponding points, observing to let them run out to the top-timber half-breadth line, where it comes without the main half-breadth line.\n\nThe hawse pieces must next be laid down in the half-breadth plan; the sides of which must look fore and aft with the ship upon account of the round of the bow. Application Take the fiding of the apron, which may be about four inches more than the stem, and set off half of it from the middle line, drawing a line from the main half-breadth to the foremost cant timber, which will represent the foremost edge of the knight-head; then from that set off the fiding of the knight-head, which may be one foot four inches, and draw the aft side of it. The hawse pieces may then be drawn, which are four in number, by setting off their sidings, namely, one foot six inches parallel from the knight-head and from each other; and straight lines being drawn from the main half-breadth line to the foremost cant timber will represent them.\n\nThe hawse holes should be described in such a manner as to wound the hawse pieces as little as possible; they may therefore be placed so that the joint of the hawse pieces shall be in the centre of the holes, whence they will only cut half the hawse pieces. Take the dimensions of the hawse holes, which is one foot six inches, and set off the foremost one, or that next the middle line, on the joint between the first and second hawse piece; then set off the other on the joint between the third and fourth hawse piece; and small lines being drawn across the main half-breadth at their respective places will represent the hawse holes in the half-breadth plan.\n\nThe hawse holes should next be represented in the sheer plan. In this class of ships they are always placed in the middle between the cheeks; therefore set off their diameter, namely, one foot six inches, between the cheeks, and draw lines parallel to the cheeks for their upper and lower part. Then to determine their situation agreeable to the half-breadth plan, which is the fore and aft way, draw perpendiculars from their intersections with the main half-breadth line to the lines drawn between the cheeks, and their true situations, the fore and aft way, will be obtained; and, by describing them round or circular, according to the points set off, they will be represented as they appear in the sheer plan.\n\nThe apron may be drawn in the sheer plan, setting off its bignefs from the stem, and letting it come to low that the scarf may be about two feet higher than the foremost end of the fore foot; by which it will give ship to the scarf of the stem. It may run up to the head of the stem.\n\nThe cutting down should next be drawn. Take therefore from the tables of dimensions the different heights there expressed, and set them off from the upper edge of the keel on the corresponding timbers in the sheer plan; then a curve described through the points set off, from the inner post aft to the apron forward, will be the cutting down. Next set off from the cutting down the thickness of the timber strake, which is eight inches and a half, and a curve described parallel to the former will represent the timber strake, from which the depth of the hold is always measured.\n\nThe kelson is drawn, by taking its depth from the dimensions, and set it off above the cutting down line; and a curve described parallel to the cutting down will represent the kelson.\n\nThe cutting down line being described, the knee of the dead wood abaft timber $7$, being the after floor timber, may then be represented. Set off the fiding of the floor abaft it, and erect a perpendicular in the sheer plan, which will terminate the foremost end of\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication of the dead wood: then the fore and aft arm of the knee may be half the length of the whole dead wood, and the up and down arm may reach to the under part of the lower transom; and the whole knee may be placed in such a manner that the upper piece of the dead wood shall bolt over it, and be of as much substance as the knee itself: therefore the knee must consequently be placed its whole thickness below the cutting down line representing the upper part of the dead wood.\n\nThe sheer draught, the body, and half-breadth plan are now finished, from whence the ship may be laid down in the mould loft, and also the whole frame erected. As, however, the use of the diagonal lines in the body plan has not been sufficiently explained, it is therefore thought proper to subjoin the following illustration of them.\n\nThe diagonal lines in the body plan are mentioned in the tables of dimensions merely for the purpose of forming the body therefrom; but after the body is formed, they are of very principal use, as at their stations the ribbands and harpins which keep the body of the ship together while her frames are all described, and the heads of the different timbers in the frame likewise determined.\n\nThe lowermost diagonal, or No. 1, which is named the lower firmark, at which place the bevellings are taken for the hollow of the floors; its situation is generally in the middle between the keel and the floor firmark.\n\nSecond diagonal is placed in the midships, about 18 inches below the floor head, and is the station where the floor ribband is placed in midships, and likewise the floor harpin forward; there is also a bevelling taken at this diagonal all the way fore and aft, from which it is termed the floor firmark.\n\nThird diagonal, terminates the length of the floors, and is therefore called the floor head. There are likewise bevellings taken at this diagonal as far forward and aft as the floor extends. The placing of this diagonal is of the utmost consequence to the strength of the ship, it being so near to that part of the bulge which takes the ground, and of consequence is always liable to the greatest strain: it should therefore be placed as much above the bearing of the body in midships as could be conveniently allowed by conversion of the timber; but afore and abaft it is not of so much consequence.\n\nFourth diagonal is placed in the middle between the floor head and the fifth diagonal, at which place a ribband and harpin are stationed for the security of the first or lower futtock, from whence it is named the first futtock firmark. There are also bevellings taken at this diagonal all fore and aft, which being part of the body where the timbers most vary, occasions them to be the greatest bevellings in the whole body.\n\nFifth diagonal terminates the heads of the first futtocks, and is therefore called the first futtock head. It should be placed at a convenient distance above the floor head, in order to give a sufficient scarf to the lower part of the second futtocks. There are likewise bevellings for the timbers taken at this diagonal, all fore and aft.\n\nSixth diagonal should be placed in the middle between the first futtock head and the seventh diagonal; at which place the ribband and harpin are stationed for the support of the second futtocks. Bevellings are taken at this diagonal all fore and aft. It is named the second futtock firmark.\n\nSeventh diagonal terminates the second futtock heads from the fore to the aftermost floors, and afore and abaft them it terminates the double futtock heads in the fore and aft cant bodies. It should be placed in midships, as much above the first futtock head as the first futtock is above the floor head; by which it gives the same scarf to the lower part of the third futtock as the first futtock does to the second. There are bevellings taken all fore and aft at this diagonal. It is named the second futtock head.\n\nEighth diagonal is the station for the ribband and harpin which supports the third futtocks, and is therefore placed between the second futtock head and ninth diagonal. It is also a bevelling place, and is named the third futtock firmark.\n\nNinth and last diagonal is placed the same distance above the second futtock head as that is above the first, and terminates all the heads of the third futtocks which are in the frames, as they come between the ports; but such as are between the frames, and come under the lower deck ports, must run up to the under part of the ports, as no short timbers should by any means be admitted under the ports, which require the greatest possible strength. This diagonal is likewise a bevelling place for the heads of the third futtocks, and is therefore called the third futtock head.\n\nThe fourth futtock heads are terminated by the under part of the upper deck ports all fore and aft, and a ribband is placed fore and aft at the height of the upper breadth line, another between the lower and upper deck ports, and one at the top-timber line; which, with the ribbands and harpins before mentioned, keep the whole body of the ship together, and likewise in its proper form and shape.\n\nIt must be observed, that the diagonal lines laid down in the dimensions will not correspond to what has been said above upon diagonals, as they were drawn differently upon the body for the purpose of giving the true dimensions of it. Therefore, when the body is drawn in fair, the first diagonals (which should only be in pencil) are to be rubbed out, and the proper diagonals drawn with red ink, strictly adhering to what has been said above.\n\nSect. III. Of the Inboard Works of the Ship described in the preceding Section.\n\nDraughts of the outboard works being now constructed, in which every part is described that is necessary to enable the artist to put the ship in her frames, we must now proceed to form another draught of the cavity of the ship or inboard works, which must be so contrived that every thing within the ship may be arranged in the most commodious manner and to the best advantage.\n\nIt is usual to draw the inboard works in the sheer draught; but as this generally occasions much confusion, it is therefore the best and safest method to appropriate a draught to this particular purpose.\n\nTake from the sheer-draught the stem, stern-post, counter timbers, and keel, and describe them on another paper; draw in also the cutting down, kelton, apron, transoms, fathom-pieces, and decks, and the upper line of the sheer all fore and aft, also pass the timbers and ports.\nThe beams come first under consideration, and should be so disposed as to come one under and one between each port, or as near as can be to answer other works of the ship; but where it happens that a beam cannot possibly be placed under the port, then a beam arm should be introduced to make good the deficiency. Every beam, and also the beam arms, should be kned at each end with one lodging and one hanging knee; and in those parts of the ship which require the knees to be very acute, such as the after beams of the gun-deck, and in some ships, whose bodies are very sharp, the foremost beams of the gun-deck, there should be knees of iron. Care should be taken always to let the upper side of the knees be below the surface of the beams, in large ships one inch and a half, and in small ships an inch, by which means the air will have a free passage between the knees and under part of the deck.\n\nIn the conversion of the beams the fide next the lodging knee should be left as broad at the end of the beam as can possibly be allowed by the timber, the beam retaining its proper scantling at the end of the lodging knee: by so doing the lodging knees will be more without a square, which consequently makes them the more easily to be provided.\n\nIn ships where the beams can be got in one piece, they should be so disposed as to have every other one with the butt end the same way; for this reason, that the butts will decay before the tops. In large ships the beams are made in two or three pieces, and are therefore allowed to be stronger than those that are in one piece. The beams in two pieces may have the scarf one-third of the length, and those in three pieces should have the middle piece half the length of the whole beam. The customary way of putting them together is to table them; and the length of the tablings should be one-half more than the depth of the beam. It is very common to divide the tablings in the middle of the beam, and that part which is taken out at the upper side to be left at the lower side, and then kersey or flannel is put into the scarf: but in this case the water is liable to lie in the scarf, and must be the means of rotting the beams. If, however, the beams were tabbed together in dovetails, and taken through from side to side, putting tar only between them, which hardens the wood; then the water occasioned by the leaking of the decks would have a free passage, and the beam would dry again; and this method would not be found inferior in point of strength to the other. The length of the fore and aft arm of the lodging knee should extend to the side of the hanging knee next to it; but there is no necessity for that arm to be longer than the other. In fastening the knees, care would be taken to let one bolt pass exactly through the middle of the throat, one foot six inches from each end, and the rest divided equally between; observing always to have the holes bored square from the knee. The bolts for the thwartship arms of both hanging and lodging knees may go through the arms of each knee, and drive every one the other way.\n\nIn order to draw the beams in the draught, take the moulding of the lower deck beams, and set off below the line representing the deck at the fide, and draw a line in pencil parallel thereto, which will represent the under side of the beams. In like manner represent the under side of the beams for the upper deck, quarter deck, forecastle, and roundhouse. Then take the fiding of the lower deck beams, and place one under and one between each port, all fore and aft, drawing them in pencil. Determine the dimensions of the well fore and aft, which is ten feet, and set it off abaft the beam under the eighth port, placing the beam under the ninth port at that distance: those two beams may then be drawn in ink, and will terminate the extent of the well the fore and aft way; and as a beam cannot go across the ship at that place upon account of its being the well and mast room, there must therefore be a beam arm between these two beams.\n\nThe main hatchway should then be determined, letting the beam that forms the fore part of the well form the aft part of it, and the beam under the next part may form the fore side of it, which beam may also be now drawn in ink: there should also be another beam arm introduced in the wake of the main hatchway.\n\nThe fore hatchway may be next determined; the fore side of which should range well up and down with the after end of the forecastle, and it may be fore and aft about four-fevenths of the main hatchway. At the fore-side of the fore hatchway there must be a ladder-way down to the orlop, which may be as much fore and aft as the beams will allow. The rest of the beams afore the fore hatchway may remain as first placed, there being nothing in the way to alter the ship. Then determine on the after hatchway, the foreside of which comes to the aft side of the mainmast room.\n\nThere should also be a hatchway, the foreside of which may be formed by the aft side of the beam under the twelfth port; which is for the convenience of the spirit and fish rooms: and there should be a ladder-way abaft it to lead down to the cockpit. There may be also another hatchway, the foreside of it to be formed by the aft side of the beam under the eleventh port. The size of the ladder and hatchways must be governed by the beams, as when there is a good shift of beams they should not be altered for ladder and hatchways, unless it is the three principal hatchways, which must always be of a proper size, according to the size of the ship.\n\nThe after capstan must be placed between the two hatchways last described, and the beams abaft may stand as they are already shifted, observing only the mizenmast. There should be a small scuttle placed afore the second beam from aft, for the convenience of the bread room: it must be on one side of the middle lines, as there is a carling at the middle under the four or five after beams to receive the pillars for the support thereof.\n\nThe bits may be placed, letting the foreside of the after ones come against the aft side of the beam abaft the third port, and the foreside of the foremost ones against the next beam but one forward; then at the foreside of each bit there should be drawn a small scuttle for the convenience of handling up the powder from the magazine. The breast hook should also be drawn, which may be three feet the moulding away, and sided nine-tenths of the beams of the lower deck.\n\nThe gun-deck, beams, knees, &c. being described; in which, as well as all the decks having ports, the same precautions are to be used as in the gun-deck; and ob-\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication serving to keep the beams upon one deck as nearly as possible over the beams of the other, for the convenience of pillaring, as they will then support each other.\n\nThe hatchways are to be placed exactly over those on the lower deck, each over each; and therefore, where there is a beam arm in the lower deck there must also be one above it in the upper deck, and the same in the middle deck in three-deck ships. It commonly happens in ships of the line that there cannot be a whole beam between the deck breast hook and the beam that supports the step of the bowprit, because the bowprit passes through that place: in this case, there must be a beam arm placed, letting the end come equally between the beam and the breast hook: but in ships that the bowprit will allow of a whole beam, then the ports and the reil of the beams must be consulted in order to space it; and when it so happens that the foremast comes in the wake of a port, then a beam arm must be necessarily introduced.\n\nHaving placed the beams according to the disposition of the other beams below, the ladderways should be contrived: there should be one next abaft the fore hatchway, which is a single ladderway, and one next afore the main hatch, which is a double ladderway; the ladders standing the fore and aft way. There should also be another next abaft the after hatch, and one over the cockpit corresponding with that on the lower deck.\n\nThe capstans are next to be considered; the after one is already placed on the lower deck, the barrel of which must pass through the upper deck to receive the whelps and drumhead there, it being a double capstan. In ships having three decks, the upper part of each capstan is in the middle deck; but in ships with one deck there is only this one capstan, the upper part of which is placed on the quarter deck. The foremost capstan should be placed in the most convenient spot, to admit of its being lowered down to the orlop out of the way of the long boat: it may therefore be placed between the main and fore hatchways; the beam under the fifth part of the lower deck may form the aft side of its room, and the beams on each side of it should be placed exactly over or under the beams on the other decks, and they should be at a distance from each other sufficient to let the drumheads pass between them. The centre of the capstan should then be placed in the middle between the beams which compose its room; and the partners should be fitted in such a manner as to shift occasionally when wanted, which is by letting them be in two pieces fitted together. The partners on the lower deck, wherein the capstan steps, must be supported by a pillar on the orlop deck, the lower part of which may be fitted in an oak chock; so that when the pillar is taken away, and the capstan lowered down, that chock serves as a step for the capstan. These two beams on the orlop, by having the pillar and check upon them, have therefore the whole weight of the capstan pressing downwards: for the support of them, there should be a carling placed underneath the fore and aft way, with three pillars, one under each beam, and one between; all of them being steep in the keelson, by which the orlop deck will be well supported in the wake of the capstan, and the other decks will feel no strain from it.\n\nThe fire hearth is next to be disposed; which is placed differently according to the size of the ship. In three-deckers it is found most convenient to place it on the middle deck; whence there is much more room under the forecastle than there would have been had it been placed there. In all two-deck ships it is placed under the forecastle, because on the deck underneath the bits are in the way. It is also under the forecastle in one-deck ships, though confined between the bits; in this case it should be kept as near as possible to the after bits, that there may be more room between it and the foremost bits to make a good galley.\n\nThe positions of the main-toprail-sheet bits are next to be determined; the foremost of which must be so placed as to let its foreside come against the aft side of the beam abaft the main hatchway, and to pass down to the lower deck, and there step in the beams: admitting it to be a straight piece, it would come at the aft side of the lower deck beam the same as it does at the upper deck beam, in consequence of those two beams ranging well up and down with each other: it must therefore have a cant under the upper deck beam, by which the lower part may be brought forward sufficient to stop in the lower deck beam. The aftermost must be placed against the foreside of the beam abaft the mast, and step on the beam below; but there is no necessity to provide a crooked piece as before, for the beam of the upper deck may be moved a little farther aft, till it admits of the bit stopping on the lower deck beam, unless the beam comes under a port, as in that case it must not by any means be moved. The crook pieces to the bits should be on the foreside, and in height from the upper deck about one-third of the height between it and the quarter deck. With regard to the heads of the bits, the length of the ship's width should be considered; and if there is length enough from the forecastle to the foremost bits to admit of the spare gear being stowed thereon without reaching farther aft, the quarter deck may then run so far forward that the head of the foremost bits shall tenon in the foremost beam; this gives the mainmast another deck, and admits of the quarter deck being all that the longer; but if there is not the room before mentioned, then the quarter deck must run no further forward than the after bits, which will then tenon in the foremost beam; and the foremost bits must have a crook piece let on their heads, which is termed a horse, and will be for the purpose of receiving the ends of the spare gear.\n\nThe length of the quarter deck being now determined, the beams are then to be placed. For this purpose the several contrivances in the quarter deck must be previously consulted. It is necessary to observe, that there are neither carlings nor lodges, the carlings of the hatches excepted, in the quarter deck, round-house, and forecastle; as they would weaken instead of strengthening the beams, which should be as small as the size of the ship will permit, in order that the upper works may be as light as possible. Hence, as there are to be neither carlings nor lodges, the deck will require a greater number of beams, and a good round up, as on the contrary the deck will be apt to bend with its own weight. The most approved rule is therefore to have double the number of beams in the quarter deck as there are in a space of the same length in the upper deck.\n\nThen proceed to shift the beams to the best advantage,\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication tage, consulting the hatchways, ladder-ways, masts, bits, wheel, &c. With respect to the ladder-ways on the quarter decks of all ships, there should be one near the fore part of the great cabin for the officers, and another near the forecastle end of the quarter deck, consisting of double ladders for the conveyance of the men up from the other decks in cases of emergency; and likewise one on each side of the fore part of the quarter deck from the gangway: and in every ship of the line all the beams from the forecastle ladder-way to the after one should be open with gratings, both for the admission of air, and for the greater expedition of conveying different articles in the time of action.\n\nTwo scuttles are to be disposed one on each side of the mainmast, if it happens to come through the quarter deck, for the top tackles to pass through, to hook to the eye bolts drove in the upper deck for that purpose.\n\nThe steering wheel should be placed under the forecastle of the roundhouse, and the two beams of the quarter deck, which come under it, should be placed conformable to the two uprights, so that they may tenon in them. The quarter deck beams should be kned at each end with one hanging and one lodging knee; which adds greatly to the strength of the tide. The hanging knees which come in the great cabin may be of iron; their vertical arms to be two-thirds of the length of that of wood, and to reach the spirketing. It should be observed, that the beam abaft, which comes under the forecastle bulkhead, should round aft agreeable to the round of the bulkhead, for the support of the same.\n\nThe forecastle beams should be placed according as the works of the deck will admit. The hatchways are therefore to be considered first. There should be one for the funnel of the fire hearth to pass through, and one for the copper to admit of vent for the steam; and also one or two over the galley as the forecastle will admit of. The fore-topmast-sheet bits should be disposed as to come one pair on the fore and one on the aft side of the mast, to let into the side of the forecastle beams, and step on the upper deck beams below: there should also be a ladder-way at the fore part of the forecastle for the convenience of the fore part of the ship.\n\nThe beams may now be placed agreeable thereto, their number being four more than there are in a space in the upper deck equal in length to the forecastle; and where there happens to be a wide opening between the beams, as in the case of a hatchway, mast room, &c., then half a beam of fir may be introduced to make good the deficiency. The forecastle beam should be of a breadth sufficient to take the aft side of the inboard arms of the catheads, as they are secured upon this beam by being bolted thereto. Every beam of the forecastle should be kned at each end with one hanging and one lodging knee: the vertical arms of the hanging knees should reach the spirketing, and the knees well bolted and carefully clenched.\n\nProceed to the roundhouse; the same things being observed with respect to the beams as in the quarter deck: for as the roundhouse beams are fitted very small, it hence follows that they must be near to each other. Let therefore the number of beams on the roundhouse be four more than in the same length of the quarter deck; every other beam being of fir for lightness, and every oak beam may be kned at each end with one of the fore-hanging and one lodging knee; the hanging knees abaft may be of iron, their vertical arms to be in length two-thirds of those of wood. The roundhouse should always have a great round up, both for strength and convenience. There must be on the roundhouse a small pair of knees-bits on each side of the mizzenmast, turned round and fastened over each other, and bolted through the mast carlings. There must also be a companion on the roundhouse placed over the middle of the coach, in order to give light thereto.\n\nWith regard to placing the roundhouse beams, the uprights of the steering wheel and the mizenmast are to be observed; as when the beams which interfere with these parts are properly spaced, the rest may be disposed of at discretion, or at an equal distance from each other, and setting the beam over the forecastle bulkhead have a proper round aft, agreeable to the quarter deck beam underneath.\n\nThe upper parts of the inboard works being now described, proceed next to the lower parts, or to those which come below the lower deck. Draw in the orlop, by taking the heights afore, at midships, and abaft, between that and the gun-deck, from the dimensions, and a curve described through these points will represent the upper part of the deck. Set off the thickness of the plank below, and the under side of the plank will be represented. As this deck does not run quite forward and aft as the other decks, the length of it must be therefore determined; for this purpose let the after beam be placed at a sufficient distance from aft to admit of the bread rooms being of a proper size for the ship, which will be under that beam of the gun-deck that comes at the second part from aft. The after beam being drawn in, proceed to space the other beams, placing them exactly under those of the gun-deck; and that which comes under the forecastle beam of the gun-deck may terminate the fore part of the orlop. Draw the limber stroke, by letting off its thickness above the cutting down line, and a line drawn parallel thereto will represent the limber stroke. That part of the orlop which is over the after magazine, spirit room, and fifth-room, and also that which is over the fore magazine, is laid with thicker planks than the rest of the deck; which is for the better security of those places, the planks being laid over the beams; but in the midships, from the fore part of the spirit room to the aft part of the fore magazine, the beams are laid level with the surface of the deck, and the planks are rabbeted in from one beam to the other.\n\nIn order to represent the orlop as just described, the dimensions of the different apartments above mentioned must be determined: Let the aft side of the after beam be the aft side of the after magazine, and from thence draw the bulkhead down to the limber stroke; and the foreside of the third beam may be the foreside of the after magazine, drawing that bulkhead likewise, which will also form the aft side of the fifth room; the foreside of the fifth room may be drawn from the aft side of the fifth beam, which will also represent the aft side of the spirit room; then the foreside of the spirit room may be drawn from the foreside of the sixth beam. Hence from the foreside of the sixth beam quite aft the deck will...\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nApplication will be represented by the two lines already drawn, and the upper side of the beams will be represented by the lower line.\n\nProceed next to the fore part of the orlop, letting the foreside of the after bits be the aft part of the foremost magazine, drawing the bulkhead thereof, which will come to the aft side of the fifth beam; therefore, from the fifth beam to the foremost end of the orlop, the plank and beams will be represented just in the same manner as before mentioned for the after part of the orlop: then the midship part of the deck will be represented by letting the upper line be the upper side of the plank, and likewise the upper side of the beams; and the lower line will represent the lower edge of the plank, only drawing it from beam to beam, and observing not to let it pass through them.\n\nThe hatchways, &c., may now be represented on the orlop, letting the main, fore, and after hatchway, be exactly under those of the gun-deck: there must be one over the fish room, and one over the spirit room. There must be two scuttles over the after magazine for the passage to the magazine and light room. There should also be one above the fourth beam from forward for the passage to the fore magazine, and one abaft the second beam for the passage to the light room.\n\nThe bulkheads for the fore and after parts of the well may be drawn from the lower deck beams to the orlop, and from thence to the limber strake in the hold. The shot lockers may also be represented, having one above and one abaft the well: there should also be one abaft the foremost magazine, the ends of which may be formed by the after bits. The steps of the masts may be drawn in by continuing their centres down to the limber strake; and likewise two crutches abaft the mizen step divided equally between that and the after part of the cutting down: the breach hooks may also be drawn letting them be five in number below the lower deck hook, and all equally divided between that and the fore step. Hence every part of the inboard is described as far as necessary.\n\nCHAP. V. Of the Method of Whole-moulding.\n\nHaving now finished the methods of laying down the several plans of a ship, any farther addition on this subject might appear unnecessary. We cannot, however, with propriety, omit to describe the method called whole-moulding, used by the ancients, and which still continues in use among those unacquainted with the more proper methods already explained. This method will be illustrated by laying down the several plans of a long-boat; the length of the keel being 29 feet, and breadth moulded nine feet.\n\nDraw the straight line PO (fig. 37.) equal to 29 feet, the extreme length of the boat, and also to represent the upper edge of the keel. Let ⊕ be the station of the midship frame. From the points, P, ⊕, and O, draw the lines PT, ⊕M, and OS, perpendicular to PO. Make ⊕M, ⊕N, equal to the upper and lower heights of breadth respectively at the main frame, PT the height of breadth at the transom, and OS the height at the stem. Describe the curve TMS to represent the sheer or extreme height of the side, which in a ship would be called the upper height of breadth line, or upper edge of the wale. Through the point N draw a curve parallel to TMS, to represent the breadth of the Method of upper strake of a boat, or lower edge of the wale if in a ship. The dotted line TNS may also be drawn to represent the lower height of breadth.\n\nSet off the rake of the port from P to p, and draw the line p t to represent the aft side of the port; then T t will represent the round-up of the transom. Set off the breadth of the port from p to r, and from T to s, and draw the line r s to represent the foreside of the port, which may either be a curve or a straight line at pleasure. Set up the height of the tuck from p to k. Let k X be the thickness of the transom, and draw the line ZX to represent the foreside of the transom.\n\nThere is given the point S, the height of the sheer on the foreside of the stem; now that side of the stem is to be formed either by tweeps or some other contrivance. Set off the breadth of the stem, and form the aft side of it.\n\nSet up the dead-rising from ⊕ to d, and form the rising line r i s. Draw the line KL parallel to PO to represent the lower edge of the keel, and another to represent the thickness of the plank on the rabbit. The rabbit on the port and starboard may also be represented; and the stations of the timbers assigned, as ⊕, (1), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; and ⊕, (A), A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H; and the sheer plan will be completed.\n\nThe half-breadth plan is to be formed next; for this purpose the perpendiculars TP, 9, 8, &c., must be produced. Upon M ⊕ produced set off the half breadth from the line KL to R (fig. 38.); set off also the half breadth at the transom from K to b, and describe the extreme half-breadth line b RX, making the forepart of the curve agreeable to the proposed round of the transom.\n\nWe may next proceed to form the timbers in the body plan. Let AB (fig. 39.) be the breadth moulded at ⊕. Erect the perpendicular CD in the middle of the line AB; draw the line mn distant therefrom the half thickness of the port, and xy the half thickness of the stern. Then take off the several portions of the perpendiculars ⊕, 1, 2, &c., intercepted between the upper edge of the keel and the rising line in the sheer plan, and set them up from C upon the line CD; through these points draw lines parallel to AC; take off also the several lower heights of breadth at ⊕, 1, 2, &c., from the sheer plan; and set them up from C upon the middle line in the body plan; and draw lines parallel to AC through these points: Then take off the several half breadths corresponding to each from the floor plan; and set them off on their proper half-breadth lines from the middle line in the body plan.\n\nConstruct the midship frame by Problem V. the form of which will in some measure determine the form of the rest. For if a mould be made on any side of the middle line to fit the curve part of it, and the rising line, or that marked bond mould (fig. 40.), and laid in such a manner that the lower part of it, which is straight, may be set upon the several rising lines, and the upper part just touch the point of the half breadth in the breadth line corresponding to that rising upon which the mould is placed, a curve may then be drawn by the mould to the rising line. In this manner we may proceed so far as the rising line is parallel to the lower height of the breadth line. Then a hollow mould must be made, the upper end of which is left straight, as\nthat marked hollow mould (fig. 40.). This is applied in such a manner, that some part of the hollow may touch the side of the keel, and the straight part touch the back of the curve before described by the bend mould; and, beginning abaft, the straight part will always come lower on every timber, till we come to the midship timber, when it comes to the side of the keel. Having thus formed the timbers, so far as the whole mouldings will serve, the timbers abaft them are next formed. Their half breadths are determined by the sheer and floor plans, which are the only fixed points through which the curves of these timbers must pass. Some form these after timbers before the whole is moulded, and then make the hollow mould, which will be straighter than the hollow of either of these timbers. It is indifferent which are first formed, or what methods are used; for after the timbers are all formed, though every timber may appear very fair when considered by itself, it is uncertain what the form of the side will be.\n\nIn order to find which, we must form several ribband and water lines; and if these do not make fair curves, they must be rectified, and the timbers formed from these ribband and water lines. In using the hollow mould, when it is applied to the curve of each timber, if the straight part is produced to the middle line, we shall have as many points of intersection as there are timbers; and if the heights above the base be transferred to the corresponding timbers in the sheer plan, a curve passing through these points is what is called a rising flint. This may be formed by fixing a point for the aftermost timber that is whole moulded, and transferring that height to the sheer plan. The curve must pass through this point, and fall in with the rising line somewhere abaft dead flat; and if the several heights of this line be transferred from the sheer to the middle line in the body plan, these points will regulate what is called the hauling down of the hollow mould.\n\nThe timbers in the after body being all formed, those in the fore body are formed in the same manner, by transferring the several heights of the rising and breadth lines from the sheer to the body plans; the half breadths corresponding to each height must also be transferred from the floor to the body plan. The same hollow mould will serve both for the fore and after body; and the level lines, by which the water lines to prove the after body were formed, may be produced into the fore body, and by them the water lines to prove the fore body may be described.\n\nAnother method of proving the body is by ribband lines, which are formed by sections of planes inclined to the sheer plan, and intersecting the body plan diagonally, as before observed, of which there may be as many as may be judged necessary. As this has been already explained, we shall therefore lay down only one, represented in the body plan by the lines marked d i a. These are drawn in such a manner as to be perpendicular to as many timbers as conveniently may be. After they are drawn in the body plan, the several portions of the diagonal intercepted between the middle line and each timber must be transferred to the floor plan. Thus, fix one foot of the compasses in the point where the diagonal intersects the middle line in the body plan; extend the other foot to the point where the diagonal intersects the timber; for example, timber 9: Set off the same extent upon the perpendicular representing the plane of timber 9 from the point where it intersects the line K L on the floor plan: in like manner proceed with all the other timbers both in the fore and after body; and these shall have the points through which the curve must pass. If this should not prove a fair curve, it must be altered, observing to conform to the points as nearly as the nature of the curve will admit: so it may be carried within one point, and without another, according as we find the timbers will allow. For after all the ribband lines are formed, the timbers must, if needful, be altered by the ribband lines: this is only the reverse of forming the ribband lines; for taking the portions of the several perpendiculars intercepted between the line K L and the curve of the ribband line in the floor plan, and setting them off upon the diagonal from the point where it intersects the middle line, we shall have the points in the diagonal through which the curves of the timbers must pass. Thus the distance between the line K L and the ribband at timber 3 on the floor plan, when transferred to the body plan, will extend on the diagonal from the middle line to the point where the curve of timber 3 intersects that diagonal. The like may be said of all the other timbers; and if several ribband lines be formed, they may be contrived that their diagonals in the body plan shall be at such distances, that a point for every timber being given in each diagonal, will be sufficient to determine the form of all the timbers.\n\nIn stationing the timbers upon the keel for a boat, there must be room for two futtocks in the space before or abaft ⊕; for which reason, the distance between these two timbers will be as much more than that between the other as the timber is broad. Here it is between ⊕ and (A); which contains the distances between ⊕ and (1), and the breadth of the timber besides.\n\nThe timbers being now formed, and proved by ribband and water lines, proceed then to form the transom, fashion-pieces, &c. by Problem VI.\n\nThis method of whole-moulding will not answer for the long timbers afore and abaft. They are generally canted in the same manner as those for a ship. In order to render this method more complete, we shall here describe the manner of moulding the timbers after they are laid down in the mould loft, by a rising square, bend, and hollow mould.\n\nIt was shown before how to form the timbers by the bend and hollow moulds on the draught. The same method must be used in the loft; but the moulds must be made to their proper scantlings in real feet and inches. Now when they are set, as before directed, for moulding each timber, let the middle line in the body plan be drawn across the bend mould, and draw a line across the hollow mould at the point where it touches the upper edge of the keel; and let them be marked with the proper name of the timber, as in fig. 40. The graduations of the bend mould will therefore be exactly the same as the narrowing of the breadth. Thus, the distance between ⊕ and 7 on the bend mould is equal to the difference between the half breadth of timber 7 and that of ⊕. The height of the head of each timber is likewise marked on the bend mould, and also the floor and breadth firmarks. The floor firmark is in that point where a straight edged batten touches the back.\nback of the bend mould, the batten being so placed as to touch the lower edge of the keel at the same time. The several risings of the floor and heights of the cutting down line are marked on the rising square, and the half breadth of the keel is set off from the side of it.\n\nThe moulds being thus prepared, we shall apply them to mould timber 7. The timber being first properly sided to its breadth, lay the bend mould upon it, so as may best answer the round according to the grain of the wood; then lay the rising square to the bottom of the bend mould, so that the line drawn across the bend mould at timber 7 may coincide with the line representing the middle of the keel upon the rising square; and draw a line upon the timber by the side of the square, or let the line be scored or cut by a tool made for that purpose, called a raising knife (E); this line so raised will be the side of the keel. Then the square must be moved till the side of it comes to 7 on the bend mould, and another line must be raised in by the side of it to represent the middle of the keel. The other side of the keel must likewise be raised after the same manner, and the point 7 on the rising square be marked on each side of the keel, and a line raised across at these points to represent the upper edge of the keel. From this line the height of the cutting-down line at 7 must be let up, and then the rising square may be taken away, and the timber may be raised by the bend mould, both inside and outside, from the head to the floor firmark, or it may be carried lower if necessary. After the firmarks and head of the timbers are marked, the bend mould may likewise be taken away, and then the hollow mould applied to the back of the sweep in such a manner that the point 7 upon it may intersect the upper side of the keel, before set off by the rising square; and when in this position the timber may be raised by it, which will complete the outside of the timbers. The inside of the timbers may likewise be formed by the hollow mould. The scantling at the keel is given by the cutting down before set off. The mould must be so placed as to touch the sweep of the inside of the timber formed before by the bend mould, and pass through the cutting down point.\n\nThe use of the firmarks is to find the true places of the futtocks; for as they are cut off three or four inches short of the keel, they must be so placed that the futtock and floor firmarks may be compared and coincide. Notwithstanding which, if the timbers are not very carefully trimmed, the head of the futtock may be either within or without its proper half breadth; to prevent which a half breadth staff is made use of.\n\nThe half breadth staff may be one inch square, and of any convenient length. Upon one side of it are let off from one end the several half-breadths of all the timbers in the after body, and those of the fore body upon the opposite side. On the other two sides are let off the several heights of the sheer, the after body on one side, and the fore body on its opposite. Two sides of the staff are marked half breadths, and the other two sides heights of the sheer.\n\nThe staff being thus prepared, and the floor timbers fastened on the keel, and levelled across, the futtocks must next be fastened to the floor timbers; but they must be set first to their proper half breadth and height. The half breadth staff, with the assistance of the ram-line*, serves to set them to the half breadth; for as the keel of a boat is generally perpendicular to the horizon, therefore the line at which the plummet is suspended, and which is moveable on the ram line, will be perpendicular to the keel. Whence we may by it set the timbers perpendicular to the keel, and then set them to their proper half breadths by the staff; and when the two firmarks coincide, the futtock will be at its proper height, and may be nailed to the floor timbers, and also to the breadth ribband, which may be set to the height of the sheer by a level laid across, taking the height of the sheer by the staff from the upper side of the keel; by which means we shall discover if the ribband is exactly the height of the sheer; and if not, the true height may be set off by a pair of compasses from the level, and marked on the timbers.\n\n**CHAP. VI. Of the Practice of Ship-building.**\n\nThe elevation, projection, and half breadth plans, of a proposed ship being laid down on paper, we must next proceed to lay down these several plans on the mould loft of the real dimensions of the ship proposed to be built, and from which moulds for each separate part are to be made. The method of laying down these plans, from what has been already said, will, it is presumed, be no very difficult task to accomplish, as it is no more than enlarging the dimensions of the original draughts; and with respect to the moulds, they are very easily formed agreeable to the figure of the several parts of the ship laid down in the mould loft.\n\nBlocks of wood are now to be prepared upon which the keel is to be laid. These blocks are to be placed at nearly equal distances, as of five or six feet, and in such a manner that their upper surfaces may be exactly in the same plane, and their middle in the same straight line. This last is easily done by means of a line stretched a little more than the proposed length of the keel; and the upper planes of these blocks may be verified by a long and straight rule; and the utmost care and precaution must be taken to have these blocks properly bedded. Each block may be about five or eight inches longer than the keel is in thickness; their breadth from 12 to 14 inches, and their depth from a foot to a foot and half.\n\nThe dimensions of the keel are to be taken from the mould loft, and the keel is to be prepared accordingly. As, however, it is seldom possible to procure a piece of wood of sufficient length for a keel, especially if for a large ship, it is, therefore, for the most part necessary to compose it of several pieces, and these pieces are to be scarfed together, and securely bolted, so as to make one entire piece. It must, however, be observed, that the pieces which compose the keel ought to be of such lengths, that a scarf may not be opposite to the step of any of the masts. Rabbets are to be formed on each side of the keel to receive the edge of the planks next\n\n---\n\n* The term raising is used when any line is drawn by such an instrument instead of a pencil.\nThe stem, and the post, and the several transoms belonging to it, are to be prepared from the moulds, and rabatted in like manner as the keel, to receive the ends of the plank. The transoms are to be bolted to the post at their middle, each at its respective height, taken from the elevation in the mould loft, and the extremities of the transoms are to be firmly connected with the fashion-pieces. Both stem and post are then to be erected, each at its respective extremity of the keel. The tenons at the heel of each being let into mortises prepared to receive them, and being let to their proper rakes or angles with the keel, are to be supported by props or shores. Pieces of wood called dead wood are to be laid upon and fixed to the upper side of the keel towards the fore and aft parts of it; the depth of the dead wood increasing with its distance from the middle, agreeable to the proposed form of the cutting-down line.\n\nA line is to be stretched from the middle of the head of the stem to that of the post, called the ram line, upon which is a moveable line with a plummet affixed to it. The midship and other frames are to be erected upon the keel at their proper stations. The extremities of each frame are set at equal distances from the vertical longitudinal section of the ship, by moving the frame in its own plane until the plumb-line coincides with a mark at the middle between the arms of each frame; and although the keel is inclined to the horizon, yet the frames may also be set perpendicular to the keel by means of the plumb-line. The shores which are supporting the frames are now to be securely fixed, that the position of the frames may not be altered. The ribbands are now to be nailed to the frames at their proper places, the more effectually to secure them; and the intermediate vacancies between the frames filled up with filling timbers. For a perspective view of a ship framed, see fig. 2.\n\nThe frames being now stationed, proceed next to fix on the planks, of which the wales are the principal, being much thicker and stronger than the rest. The harpins, which may be considered as a continuation of the wales at their fore ends, are fixed across the hawse pieces, and surround the fore part of the ship. The planks that inclose the ship's sides are then brought about the timbers; and the clamps, which are of equal thicknesses with the wales, fixed opposite to the wales within the ship. These are used to support the ends of the beams, and accordingly stretch from one end of the ship to the other. The thick fluff or strong planks of the bottom within board are then placed opposite to the several scarfs of the timbers, to reinforce them throughout the ship's length. The planks employed to line the ship, called the ceiling or foot-waling, is next fixed in the intervals between the thick fluff of the hold. The beams are afterwards laid across the ship to support the decks, and are connected to the side by lodging and hanging knees: the former of which are exhibited at F,\n\nPlate CLXIX. See also the article Deck; and the hanging-knees, together with the breadth, thickness, and position of the keel, floor timbers, futtocks, top-timbers, wales, clamps, thick fluff, planks within and without, beams, decks, &c.\n\nThe cable-bits being next erected, the carlings and ledges, represented in Plate CLXIX, are disposed between the beams to strengthen the deck. The waterways are then laid on the ends of the beams throughout the ship's length, and the spiking fixed close above them.—The upper deck is then planked, and the string placed under the gunnel, or planking, in the waist.\n\nThen proceed next to pluck the quarter-deck and forecastle, and to fix the partners of the masts and capsterns with the coamings of the hatches. The brewhooks are then bolted across the stem and bow withinboard, the flep of the forecastle placed on the kelson, and the riders fayed to the inside of the timbers, to reinforce the sides in different parts of the ship's length. The pointers, if any, are afterwards fixed across the hold diagonally to support the beams; and the crotches stationed in the after hold to unite the half timbers. The fleps of the mainmast and capsterns are next placed; the planks of the lower decks and orlop laid; the navet-hoods fayed to the hawse holes; and the knees of the head, or cut-water, connected to the stern. The figure of the head is then erected, and the trail-board and cheeks fixed on the side of the knee.\n\nThe taffrail and quarter-pieces, which terminate the ship abaft, the former above and the latter on each side, are then disposed, and the stern and quarter galleries framed and supported by their brackets. The pumps, with their well, are next fixed in the hold; the timberboards laid on each side of the kelson, and the garboard strake fixed on the ship's bottom next to the heel without.\n\nThe hull being thus fabricated, proceed to separate the apartments by bulkheads or partitions, to frame the port-lids, to fix the catheads and chief-trees; to form the hatchways and scuttles, and fit them with proper covers or gratings. Next fix the ladders at the different hatchways, and build the manger on the lower deck, to carry off the water that runs in at the hawse-holes when the ship rides at anchor in a sea. The bread-room and magazines are then lined; and the gunnel, rails, and gangways fixed on the upper part of the ship. The cleats, kevels, and ranges, by which the ropes are fastened, are afterwards bolted or nailed to the sides in different places.\n\nThe rudder, being fitted with its irons, is next hung to the stern-post, and the tiller or bar, by which it is managed, let into a mortise at its upper end. The scuppers, or leaden tubes, that carry the water off from the decks, are then placed in holes cut through the ship's sides; and the standards bolted to the beams and sides above the decks to which they belong. The poop lanthorns are last fixed upon their cranes over the stern, and the bilge-ways or cradles placed under the bottom to conduct the ship steadily into the water whilst launching.\n\n(r) In ships of war, which are a long while in building, it has been found that the keel is often apt to rot before they are finished. Upon this account, therefore, some builders have begun with the floor timbers, and added the keel afterwards.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nAs the various pieces which have been mentioned above are explained at large in their proper places, it is therefore superfluous to enter into a more particular description of them here.\n\nCHAP. VII. Of Improvements in the Masts and Rudder.\n\nAn account of a method for restoring masts of ships when wounded, or otherwise injured, in an easy, cheap, and expeditious manner, by Captain Edward Pakenham of the royal navy, has been published in the tenth volume of the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &c. Captain Pakenham introduces his invention with the following observations:\n\n\"Among the various accidents which ships are liable to at sea, none call more for the attention and exertion of the officer than the speedy refitting of the masts; and having observed, in the course of last war, the very great destruction made among the lower masts of our ship's from the enemy's mode of fighting, as well as the very great expense and delay in refitting a fleet after an action, particularly across the Atlantic—a very simple expedient has suggested itself to me as a resource in part; which appears to be very speedy and secure, that the capacity of the meanest sailor will at once conceive it. I therefore think it my duty to state my ideas of the advantages likely to result from it; and I shall feel myself exceedingly happy should they in anywise contribute to remedy the evil.\n\n\"My plan, therefore, is, to have the heels of all lower masts so formed as to become the heads; but it is not the intention of the above plan to have the smallest alteration made in the heels of the present lower masts; for as all line-of-battle ships masts are nine inches in diameter larger at the heel than at the head, it will follow, that by letting in the trefoil-trees to their proper depth, the mast will form its own cheeks or hounds; and I flatter myself the following advantages will result from the above alteration.\n\nFirstly, I must beg to observe, that all line-of-battle ships bury one third of their lower masts, particularly three-deckers; it therefore follows, that if the wounds are in the upper third, by turning the mast so as to make the heel the head, it will be as good as new; for, in eight actions I was present in last war, I made the following observations:\n\n\"That in the said actions fifty-eight lower masts were wounded, and obliged to be shifted, thirty-two of which had their wounds in the upper third, and of course the ships detained until new masts were made. And when it is considered that a lower mast for a 90 or 74 stands government in a sum not less, I am informed, than £200l. or £300l. the advantages across the Atlantic resulting from the aforesaid plan will be particularly obvious; not to mention the probability of there being no fit spars in the country, which was the case in the instances of the Iris and Princess Royal; and as I was one of the lieutenants of the Iris at that time, I am more particular in the circumstance of that ship. The Iris had both her lower masts wounded above the cathead pins in her action with the Caesar, a French 74; and as there were no spars at New York, the Iris was detained five weeks at that place.—Now, if her masts had been fitted on the plan I have proposed, I am confident she would have been ready for sea in 48 hours; and as a further proof, I beg leave to add, that the whole fleet, on the glorious 12th of April, had not the least accident of any consequence except what befell their lower masts, which detained them between eight and ten weeks at Jamaica.\n\n\"The delay of a ship while a new mast is making, and probably the fleet being detained for want of that ship, which frequently occurred in the course of last war, the taking of shipwrights from other work, with a variety of inconveniences not necessary to mention here, must be obvious to every officer that has made the smallest observations on sea-actions.\n\n\"You will further observe, that this substitute is formed on the most simple principle, fitted to the meanest capacity, and calculated to benefit all ships, from a first-rate down to the smallest merchantman, in cases of an accident by shot, a spring, a rottenness, particularly as these accidents generally happen in the upper third of the mast and above the cheeks.\n\n\"It might probably be objected, that a difficulty and some danger might arise from the wounded part of the mast being below; but this will at once be obviated, when it is remembered, that as the wounded part is below the wedges, it may with ease be both fitted, caled, and secured, to any size or degree you please, with the addition of its being wedged on each deck.\"\n\nFig. 41. represents a mast of a first-rate in its proper state, the figures representing its thickness at the different divisions.\n\nFig. 42. the same mast inverted, the heel forming the head, and the trefoil-trees let into their proper depth, the additional thickness of the mast forming its own cheeks.\n\nFig. 43. the proposed mast, the figures representing Fig. 43. the thickness of the mast in the proposed alterations; \\(a\\), the heel made square; \\(b\\), the letting in of the trefoil-trees; \\(c\\), the third proportion of thickness continued up to where the fourth is in the present mast, or at least some little distance above the lower part of the cheeks, which is always looked upon as the weakest part of the mast; and by its being so proportioned, the mast, when turned, will be nearly as strong in the partners as before.\n\nAs the expense of a mast is much greater than is generally imagined, it is therefore thought proper to subjoin the following statement of the several articles used in making a 74 gun ship's mainmast.\n\n| Value. | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| L. 101 | Two side fishes, 22 inches, 2 nails of two masts |\n| L. 133 | Fore and aft fishes, 22 inches, 2 nails of one mast |\n| L. 66 | Fifth 21\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, 1 nail of half a mast |\n| L. 29 | On the fore part |\n| L. 15 | Iron 3 qrs. 19 lbs |\n| L. 12 | Aree load baulk, 2 loads 22 feet |\n| L. 11 | Breadthning 2 loads 7 feet |\n| L. 20 | Cheeks 4 loads 2 feet |\n| L. 8 | Iron, 5 cwt. 2 qrs. 24 lb |\n| L. 0 | Knees, elm timber, 13 feet |\n| L. 0 | Iron, 2 qrs. 14 lb |\n\nCarried over L. 385 17 8\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nImprovements in the Masts and Rudders.\n\n| Item                                      | Value |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Hoops and bolts on the body, 13 cwt.      | L. 385 17 8 |\n| 1 qr. 16 lb.                              |       |\n| Trestle trees, straight oak timber, second fort, 2 loads 10 feet, | 18 15 0 |\n| Iron, 3 qrs. 10 lb.                       | 10 2 4 |\n| Croft trees, straight oak timber, second fort, 1 load 12 feet, | 1 3 6 |\n| Iron, 2 qrs. 2 lb.                        | 5 14 0 |\n| Cap, elm timber, 1 load 24 feet,          | 0 14 6 |\n| Iron, 2 cwt. 14 lb.                       | 4 6 0 |\n| Fullings, bolsters, bollins, and Dantzig fir, 1 load 2 feet, | 2 19 6 |\n| Workmanship                               | 5 7 8 |\n|                                           | 78 6 0 |\n\nMain-topmast of a 74 gun ship, L. 513 6 2\nMain-top-gallant-mast, 50 16 3\n\nIn order to lessen the enormous expense of masts, a proposal was made some years ago to construct them hollow; and the author having premised several experiments which he had made, proceeds as follows:\n\n\"Galileo taught us, that the resistance or strength of a hollow cylinder is to that of a full cylinder containing the same quantity of matter, as the total diameter of the hollow one is to the diameter of the full one; and these experiments show us, that the strength or resistance of two or more pieces of wood, fastened together at each end, and connected by a pillar, pillars, or framing, increases, at least to a certain degree, careris paribus, as the distance between them and number of pillars, provided the force is applied in the line or direction of the pillars.\n\n\"It is surprising that this discovery of Galileo has not been made subservient to more useful purposes. It is particularly applicable to the construction of masts, as not requiring that the hollow cylinder should be made of one solid piece of wood (g).\n\n\"However, the foregoing experiments teach us, that the same advantages may be obtained by other forms besides that of a cylinder; and that perhaps not only in a superior degree, but likewise with greater facility of execution; as by adopting a square figure, but more particularly by constructing them of separate pieces of wood, placed at proper distances from each other, in the following or any other manner that may be found most convenient. Fig. 44, 45, and 46, exhibit each the transverse section of a mast, in which the small circles represent the trees or upright pieces of wood, and the lines the beams or framing of wood, which are employed at proper places and at proper distances from each other, for connecting them together. Perhaps solid frames of wood, placed at proper distances from each other, and filling up the whole dotted space, would answer better; in which event, the mast could be strongly hooped with iron at those places, and the upright trees formed square, or of any other convenient form.\n\n\"It will be evident to those acquainted with this subject, that such masts would be greatly stronger than common ones containing the same quantity of materials. It is likewise evident that they would be less apt to spring, as being supported on a more extended base, and affording many conveniences for being better secured; and that they might be constructed of such wood as at present would be deemed altogether improper for masts: a circumstance of importance to Britain at all times, but more particularly now, when there is such difficulty in procuring wood proper for the kind of masts in common use.\"\n\nAn improvement in the rudder has lately taken place in several ships, particularly in some of those in the service of the East India Company. It will, however, be necessary previously to describe the usual form of the rudder, in order to show the advantages it possesses when constructed agreeable to the improved method.\n\nNo. 1. (fig. 47.) represents the rudder according to Popper's common method of construction; in which A.B is Naval Art, the axis of rotation. It is hence evident that a space, chitterle, considerably greater than the transverse section of the part i. rudder at the counter must be left in the counter for the rudder to revolve in. Thus, let CAB (No. 2) be the section of the rudder at the counter; then there must be a space similar to CDE in the counter, in order that the rudder may be moveable as required. Hence, to prevent the water from washing up the rudder case, a rudder coat, that is, a piece of tarred canvas, is nailed in such a manner to the rudder and counter as to cover the intermediate space; but the canvas being continually washed by the sea, soon becomes brittle, and unable to yield to the various turns of the rudder without breaking; in which case the ship is of course left pervious to the waves, even of three or four feet high; in fact, there are few men bred to the sea who have not been witnesses to the bad effects of such a space being left so ill guarded against the stroke of the waves; and many ships have, with great probability, been supposed to founder at sea from the quantity of water shipped between the rudder and counter.\n\nIt was to remedy this defect that the alteration above alluded to took place; which consists in making the upper part AFG (fig. 48. No. 1.) of the rudder ABD Fig. 48., cylindrical, and giving that part at the same time a cast forward, so that the axis of rotation may by that means be the line AD, passing as usual from E to D, through the centres of the braces which attach the rudder to the stern-post, and from E to A through the axis of the cylinder AFG, in order that the transverse section KH (No. 2.) at the counter may be a circle revolving upon its centre; in which case the space of half an inch is more than sufficient between the rudder and the counter, and consequently the necessity of a rudder coat entirely done away. But as it was foreseen, that if the rudder\n\n(g) The strength of these cylinders would be still further augmented by having solid pieces of wood placed within them at proper distances, and securely fastened to them, in the same manner, and on the same principles, that nature has furnished reeds with joints; and for answering, in some respects, the same purpose as the pillars in the experiments alluded to.\nrudder by an accident was unshipped, this alteration might endanger the tearing away of the counter, the hole is made much larger than the transverse section of the cylindric part of the rudder, and the space between filled up with pieces of wood so fitted to the counter as to be capable of withstanding the shock of the sea, but to be easily carried away with the rudder, leaving the counter, under such circumstances, in as safe a state as it would be agreeable in the present form of making rud-\n\nders in the navy.\n\n**Chapter VIII. Upon the Position of the Load-water Line, and the Capacity of a Ship.**\n\nThe weight of the quantity of water displaced by the bottom of a ship is equal to the weight of the ship with its rigging, provisions, and every thing on board. If, therefore, the exact weight of the ship when ready for sea be calculated, and also the number of cubic feet in the ship's bottom below the load-water line, and hence the weight of the water she displaces; it will be known if the load-water line is properly placed in the draught.\n\nThe position of the ship in the draught may be either on an even keel, or to draw most water abaft; but an even keel is judged to be the best position in point of velocity, when the ship is constructed suitable thereto, that is, when her natural position is such. For when a ship is constructed to swim by the stern, and when brought down to her load-water made to swim on an even keel (as is the case with most ships that are thus built), her velocity is by that means greatly retarded, and also her strength greatly diminished: for the fore-part being brought down lower than it should be, and the middle of the ship maintaining its proper depth in the water, the after part is by that means lifted, and the ship is then upon an even keel: but in consequence of her being out of her natural position, the after part is always pressing downwards with a considerable strain, which will continue till the ship's sheer is entirely broken, and in time would fall into its natural position again: for which reason we see so many ships with broken backs, that is, with their sheers altered in such a manner that the sheer rounds up, and the highest part is in the midships.\n\nSuch are the disadvantages arising from not paying a due attention to those points in the construction of a draught; therefore, when the load-water line is found to be so situated at a proper height on the draught, according to the weight given for such a ship, and also drawn parallel to the keel, as supposing that to be the best failing trim, the next thing is to examine whether the body is constructed suitable thereto, in order to avoid the above-mentioned ill consequences.\n\nIn the first place, therefore, we must divide the ship equally in two lengthwise between the fore and after perpendiculars; and the exact number of cubic feet in the whole bottom beneath the load-water line being known, we must find whether the number of cubic feet in each part so divided is the same; and if they are found to be equal, the body of the ship may then be said to be constructed in all respects suitable to her swimming on an even keel, let the shape of the body be whatever it will; and which will be found to be her natural position at the load-water line. But if either of the parts should contain a greater number of cubic feet than the other, that part which contains the greatest will swim the most out of the water, and consequently the other will swim deeper, supposing the ship in her natural position for that construction. In order, therefore, to render the ship suitably constructed to the load-water line in the draught, which is parallel to the keel, the number of cubic feet in the less part must be subtracted from the number contained in the greater part, and that part of the body is to be filled out till it has increased half the difference of their quantities, and the other part is to be drawn in as much: hence the two parts will be equal, that is, each will contain the same number of cubic feet, and the ship's body will be constructed in a manner suitable to her swimming on an even keel.\n\nIf it is proposed that the ship laid down on the draught shall not swim on an even keel, but draw more water abaft than afore, then the fore and after parts of the ship's body below the load-water line are to be compared; and if these parts are unequal, that part which is least is to be filled out by half the difference, and the other part drawn in as much as before.\n\nIt will be necessary, in the first place, to calculate the weight of a ship ready equipped for sea, from the knowledge of the weight of every separate thing in her and belonging to her, as the exact weight of all the timber, iron, lead, nails, sails, rigging, and in short all the materials, men, provisions, and every thing else on board of her, from which we shall be able afterwards to judge of the truth of the calculation, and whether the load-water line in the draught be placed agreeable thereto. This is indeed a very laborious task, upon account of the several pieces of timber, &c. being of so many different figures, and the specific gravity of some of the timber entering the construction not being precisely determined.\n\nIn order to ascertain the weight of the hull, the timber is the first thing which comes under consideration: the number of cubic feet of timber contained in the whole fabric must be found; which we shall be able to do by help of the draught and the principal dimensions and scantlings; observing to distinguish the different kinds of timber from each other, as they differ considerably in weight; then the number of cubic feet contained in the different sorts of timber being reduced into pounds, and added, will be the weight of the timber. In like manner proceed to find the weight of the iron, lead, paint, &c. and the true weight of the whole will be found.\n\nIn reducing quantity to weight, it may be observed that a cubic foot of oak is equal to 66 pounds, and the specific gravity of the other materials is as follows:\n\n| Material | Specific Gravity |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| Water    | 1000            |\n| Oak      | 891.89          |\n| Lead     | 11345           |\n| Dry elm  | 702.70          |\n| Iron     | 7643            |\n| Dry fir  | 648.64          |\n### Weight of the Hull\n\n| No. of Ft. | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| 4897       | 320080      | 1428  | 2082 |\n| 4457       | 213936      | 95    | 1136 |\n| 520        | 27040       | 12    | 160  |\n| 4651       | 2           | 171   |      |\n| 88254      | 39          | 894   |      |\n| 17920      | 8           |       |      |\n| 16123      | 7           | 443   |      |\n\n**Sum**  \n3568726 | 1593 | 496\n\n### Weight of the Furniture\n\n| Description                                      | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Complete set of masts and yards                  | 161000      | 71    | 1960 |\n| Anchors with their stocks                         | 39996       | 17    | 1916 |\n| Rigging                                           | 60128       | 30    | 1928 |\n| Sails, complete set, and spare                    | 32008       | 14    | 648  |\n| Cables and hawls                                  | 73332       | 32    | 1652 |\n| Blocks, pumps, and boats                          | 62056       | 27    | 1576 |\n\n**Sum**  \n437520 | 195 | 720\n\n### Weight of the Guns and Ammunition\n\n| Description                                      | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Guns with their carriages                        | 377034      | 168   | 714  |\n| Powder and shot, powder barrels                  | 116320      | 51    | 2080 |\n| Implements for the powder                        | 6500        | 2     | 2020 |\n| Ditto for guns, crows, handspikes                | 21573       | 9     | 1413 |\n\n**Sum**  \n521427 | 232 | 1747\n\n### Weight of the Officers Stores, etc.\n\n| Description                                      | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Carpenter's stores                                | 20187       | 9     | 27   |\n| Boatswain's stores                                | 21112       | 9     | 952  |\n| Gunner's stores                                   | 8964        | 4     | 4    |\n| Caulker's stores                                  | 5206        | 2     | 720  |\n| Surgeon and chaplain's effects                    | 11096       | 4     | 2136 |\n\n**Sum**  \n66559 | 29 | 1599\n\n### Weight of the Provisions\n\n| Description                                      | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Provisions for six months for 700 men, with all their equipage | 858970      | 383   | 1050 |\n| Water, casks, and captain's table                 | 933900      | 416   | 2060 |\n\n**Sum**  \n1792870 | 800 | 870\n\n### Recapitulation\n\n| Description                                      | No. of lbs. | Tons. | Lbs. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| The hull                                         | 3568726     | 1593  | 496  |\n| The furniture                                     | 437520      | 195   | 720  |\n| Guns and ammunition                               | 521427      | 232   | 1747 |\n| Officers stores                                   | 66559       | 29    | 1599 |\n| Provisions                                       | 1792870     | 800   | 870  |\n| Weight of the men and ballast                     | 1795361     | 801   | 1121 |\n\n**Sum**  \n8182463 | 3652 | 1983\n\n---\n\nAgreeable to the above estimate, we find that the eighty gun ship, with every thing on board and fit for sea, when brought down to the load-water line, weighs 8,182,463 pounds, or nearly 3653 tons. It may now be known if the load-water line in the draught be properly placed, by reducing the immersed part of the body into cubic feet. For if the eighty gun ship, when brought down to the load-water line, weighs 3653 tons, the quantity of water displaced must also be 3653 tons: now a cubic foot of salt water being supposed to weigh 74 pounds, if therefore 8182463 be divided by 74, the quotient is 110573, the number of cubical feet which the must displace agreeable to her weight.\n\nIt is now necessary to find the number of cubic feet contained in the ship's bottom below the load-water line by calculation. If the bottom was a regular solid, this might be very easily done; but as it is otherwise, we must be satisfied with the following method by approximation, first given by M. Bouguer.\n\nTake the lengths of every other of the lines that represent the frames in the horizontal plane upon the upper water line; then find the sum of these together, the contents with half the foremost and aftermost frames. Now multiply that sum by the distance between the frames, and tom of the product is the area of the water line contained between the foremost and aftermost frames; then find the area of that part abaft the after-frame, which forms a trapezium, and also the post and rudder; find also the area of that part afore the foremost frame, and also of the stem and gripe; then these areas being added to that first found, and the sum doubled, will be the area of the surface of the whole water line. The reason of this rule will be obvious to those acquainted with the first principles of mathematics.\n\nThe areas of the other water line may be found in the same manner: then the sum of all these areas, except that of the uppermost and lowermost, of which only one half of each must be taken, being multiplied by the distance between the water lines (these lines in the plane of elevation being equidistant from each other), and the product will be the solid content of the space contained between the lower and load-water lines.\nAdd the area of the lower water line to the area of the upper side of the keel; multiply half that sum by the distance between them, the product will be the solid content of that part between the lower water line and upper edge of the keel, supposing them parallel to each other. But if the lower water line is not parallel to the keel, the above half sum is to be multiplied by the distance between them at the middle of the ship.\n\nThe solid contents of the keel must be next found, by multiplying its length by its depth, and that product by the breadth. Then the sum of these solid contents will be the number of cubic feet contained in the immersed part of the ship's bottom, or that part below the load water line.\n\nDetermination of the number of Cubic Feet contained in the Bottom of the Eighty Gun Ship. See Plates CCCCXC. and CCCCXCI.\n\nThe fore body is divided into five, and the after body into ten, equal parts in the horizontal plane; besides the parts contained between the foremost timber and the stem, and the aftmost timber and the post. The plane of elevation is also divided into five equal parts by water lines drawn parallel to the keel. These water lines are also described upon the horizontal plane.\n\nIt is to be observed that there must be five inches added to each line that represents a frame in the horizontal plane for the thickness of the plank, that being nearly a mean between the thicknesses of the plank next the water and that on the lower part of the bottom.\n\nUpper Water Line abaft Dead Flat.\n\n| Frame dead flat | Ft.

The solidity of that part of the bottom contained between the said perpendicular and dead flat is then to be calculated, which will be found to be 25846 feet 7 inches.\n\n**Solidity of the bottom before dead flat** | 36523 f. 4 in.\n\n**Between the middle and dead flat** | 25846 7\n\n**Solid content of the fore part of the bottom** | 62369 11\n\n**Solidity of the bottom abaft dead flat** | 74050 6\n\n**Between the middle and dead flat** | 25846 7\n\n**Solid content of the aft. part of the bottom** | 48203 11\n\n**Fore part of the bottom** | 62369 11\n\n**Difference** | 14166\n\n**Half** | 7083\n\nHence the after part of the ship's bottom is too lean by 7083 cubic feet, and the fore part as much too full. The after part must therefore be filled out until it has received an addition of 7083 feet, and the fore part must be drawn in till it has lost the same quantity, and the bottom will then be constructed suitable to the ship's swimming on an even keel.\n\n---\n\n**Chap. IX. Of the Tonnage of a Ship.**\n\nThis is a question of equal importance and difficulty. By the tonnage of a ship is meant the weight of every thing that can with safety and expediency be taken on board that ship for the purpose of conveyance; it is also called the ship's burthen; and it is totally different from the weight of the whole as she floats in the water. It is perhaps best expressed by calling it the weight of the cargo. It is of importance, because it is by this that the merchant or freighter judges of the fitness of\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nTonnage of the ship for his purpose. By this government judge of the ships requisite for transport service, and by this are all revenue charges on the ship computed. It is no less difficult to answer this question by any general rule which shall be very exact, because it depends not only on the cubical dimensions of the ship's bottom, but also on the scantling of her whole frame, and in short on the weight of every thing which properly makes part of a ship ready to receive on board her cargo.\n\nThe weight of timber is variable; the scantling of the frame is no less so. We must therefore be contented with an average value which is not very remote from the truth; and this average is to be obtained, not by any mathematical discussion, but by observation of the burthen or cargo actually received, in a great variety of cases. But some form of rule of calculation must be made out. This is and must be done by persons not mathematicians. We may therefore expect to find it incapable of being reduced to any principle, and that every builder will have a different rule. Accordingly the rules given for this purpose are in general very whimsical, measures being used and combined in a way that seems quite unconnected with stereometry or the measurement of solids. The rules for calculation are even affected by the interests of the two parties opposedly concerned in the result. The calculation for the tonnage by which the customs are to be exacted by government are quite different from the rule by which the tonnage of a transport hired by government is computed; and the same ship hired as a transport will be computed near one half bigger than when paying importation duties.\n\nYet the whole of this might be made a very simple business and very exact. When the ship is launched, let her light water line be marked, and this with the cubical contents of the immersed part be noted down, and be ingrossed in the deed by which the property of the ship is conveyed from hand to hand. The weight of her masts, sails, rigging, and sea-flores, is most easily obtained; and every builder can compute the cubical contents of the body when immersed to the load water line. The difference of these is unquestionably the burden of the ship.\n\nIt is evident from what has been already said in the last chapter, that if the number of cubic feet of water which the ship displaces when light, or, which is the same, the number of cubic feet below the light water line, found by the preceding method of calculation, be subtracted from the number of cubic feet contained in the bottom below the load water line, and the remainder reduced to tons by multiplying by 74, the number of pounds in a cubic foot of sea water, and divided by 2240, the number of pounds in a ton, the quotient will be the tonnage.\n\nBut as this method is very troublesome, the following rule for this purpose is that which is used in the king's and merchants service.\n\nLet fall a perpendicular from the foreside of the stem at the height of the hawse holes (H), and another perpendicular from the back of the main post at the height of the wing transom. From the length between these two perpendiculars deduct three-fifths of the extreme breadth (I), and also as many times 24 inches as there are feet in the height of the wing transom above the upper edge of the keel; the remainder is the length of the keel for tonnage. Now multiply this length by the extreme breadth, and the product by half the extreme breadth, and this last product divided by 94 is the tonnage required.\n\nOr, multiply the length of the keel for tonnage by the square of the extreme breadth, and the product divided by 188 will give the tonnage.\n\nCalculation of the Tonnage of an Eighty Gun Ship.\n\nI.

As the body of this ship is fuller than in ships of war in general, there is therefore a nearer agreement between the tonnages found ships of war by the two different methods. It may be observed that greater ships of war carry less tonnage than they are rated at by the common rule, and that most merchant ships carry less than the truth.\n\n---\n\n(1) In the merchant service this perpendicular is let fall from the fore side of the stem at the height of the wing transom, by reason of the hawse-holes being generally so very high in merchant ships, and their stems also having a great rake forward.\n\n(2) The breadth understood in this place is the breadth from outside to outside of the plank.\n### Tonnage of a great deal more. In confirmation of this, it is thought proper to subjoin the dimensions of several ships, with the tonnage calculated therefrom.\n\n#### 1.

Then put the model in water, and load the ton until the surface of the water is exactly at the light nage of water line; and let it be suspended until the water drains off, and then weighed. Now since the weights of similar bodies are in the triplicate ratio of their homologous dimensions, the weight of the ship when light is, therefore, equal to the product of the cube of the number of times the ship exceeds the model by the weight of the model, which is to be reduced to tons. Hence, if the model is constructed to a quarter of an inch scale, and its weight expressed in ounces; then to the constant logarithm \\(0.4893356\\), add the logarithm of the weight of the model in ounces, and the sum will be the logarithm of the weight of the ship in tons.\n\nAgain, the model is to be loaded until the surface of the water coincides with the load water line. Now the model being weighed, the weight of the ship is to be found by the preceding rule: then the difference between the weights of the ship when light and loaded, is the tonnage required.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nTonnage of a Ship.\n\nIt will also be worth while to add the following exact rule of Mr Parkins, who was many years foreman of the shipwrights in Chatham dockyard.\n\n1. For Men of War.\n\nTake the length of the gun-deck from the rabbet of the stem to the rabbet of the stern-post. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of this is to be assumed as the length for tonnage, \\( = L \\).\n\nTake the extreme breadth from outside to outside of the plank; add this to the length, and take \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the sum; call this the depth for tonnage, \\( = D \\).\n\nSet up this height from the limber strake, and at that height take a breadth also from outside to outside of plank in the timber when the extreme breadth is found, and another breadth in the middle between that and the limber strake; add together the extreme breadth and these two breadths, and take \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the sum for the breadth for tonnage, \\( = B \\).\n\nMultiply \\( L, D, \\) and \\( B \\) together, and divide by 49. The quotient is the burthen in tons.\n\nThe following proof may be given of the accuracy of this rule. Column 1. is the tonnage or burthen by the king's measurement; col. 2. is the tonnage by this rule; and, col. 3. is the weight actually received on board these ships at Blackstakes:\n\n| Victory | 100 guns. | 2162 | 1839 | 1840 |\n| London  | 92       | 1845 | 1575 | 1677 |\n| Arrogant| 74       | 1614 | 1308 | 1314 |\n| Diadem  | 64       | 1369 | 1141 | 965  |\n| Adamant| 50       | 1044 | 870  | 886  |\n| Dolphin | 44       | 879  | 737  | 758  |\n| Amphion | 32       | 667  | 554  | 549  |\n| Daphne | 20       | 429  | 329  | 374  |\n\n2.

X. Of the Scale of Solidity.\n\nBy this scale the quantity of water displaced by the bottom of the ship, for which it is constructed, answering to a given draught of water, is easily obtained; and also the additional weight necessary to bring her down to the load water line.\n\nIn order to construct this scale for a given ship, it is necessary to calculate the quantity of water displaced by the keel, and by that part of the bottom below each water line in the draught. Since the areas of the several water lines are already computed for the eighty gun ship laid down in Plates CCCCXC. and CCCCCXI. the contents of these parts may hence be easily found for that ship, and are as follow.\n\n| Draught of water. | Water displaced in cubic feet. | tons. lbs. |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|\n| Keeland false keel | 2 f. 3 in.                      | 660.9       | 21 1855 |\n| Dist. bet. keel & 5th w. line | 4 1 | 8583.1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 283 1233 |\n| Sum               | 6 4 | 9243.10\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 305 848 |\n| Dist. 5th & 4th w. line | 4 1 | 18657.8\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 616 828 |\n| Sum               | 10 5 | 27901.7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 921 1676 |\n| Dist. 4th & 3rd w. line | 4 1 | 23574.6\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 778 1795 |\n| Sum               | 14 6 | 51476.2\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 1700 1231 |\n| Dist. 3rd & 2nd w. line | 4 1 | 27812.1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 918 1775 |\n| Sum               | 18 7 | 79288.3\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 2619 766 |\n| Dist. 2nd & 1st w. line | 4 1 | 31285.7\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) | 1033 1218 |\n| Sum               | 22 8 | 110573.11\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) | 3652 1984 |\n\nConstruct any convenient scale of equal parts to represent tons, as scale No. 1, and another to represent feet, as No. 2.\n\nDraw the line AB (fig. 36.) limited at A, but produced indefinitely towards B. Make AC equal to the depth of the keel, 2 feet 3 inches from scale No. 2, and through C draw a line parallel to AB, which will represent the upper edge of the keel; upon which set off Cc equal to 21 tons 18\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) lbs. taken from scale No. 1. Again, make AD equal to the distance between the eighty lower edge of the keel and the fifth water line, namely, 6 feet 4 inches, and a line drawn through D parallel to AB will be the representation of the lower water line; and make Db equal to 305 tons 8\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) lbs. the corresponding tonnage. In like manner draw the other water lines, and lay off the corresponding tonnages accordingly: then through the points A, c, b, e, f, g, h, draw the curve A c b e f g h. Through h draw h K perpendicular to AB, and it will be the greatest limit of the quantity of water expressed in tons displaced by the bottom of the ship, or that when the is brought down to the load water line. And since the ship displaces 1788 tons at her light water mark, take therefore that quantity from the scale No. 1, which being laid upon AB from A to K, and KL drawn perpendicular to AB, will be the representation of the light water.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nScale of Solidity.\n\nLet it now be required to find the number of cubic feet displaced when the draught of water is 17 feet, and the number of additional tons necessary to bring her down to the load water mark.\n\nTake the given draught of water 17 feet from the scale No 2, which laid from it will reach to I; through which draw the line IMN parallel to AB, and intersecting the curve in AC; then the distance LM applied to the scale No 1, will measure about 2248 tons, the displacement answering to that draught of water; and MN applied to the same scale will measure about 1495 tons, the additional weight necessary to bring her down to the load water mark. Alto the nearest distance between M and the line KL will measure about 460 tons, the weight already on board.\n\nIt will conduce very much to facilitate this operation to divide KB into a scale of tons taken from the scale No 1, beginning at B, and also L, beginning at h. Then when the draught of water is taken from the scale No 2, and laid from it to I, as in the former example, and IMN drawn parallel to AB, and intersecting the curve in M. Now through M draw a line perpendicular to AB, and it will meet KB in a point representing the number of tons aboard, and also L in a point denoting the additional weight necessary to load her.\n\nAgain, if the weight on board be given, the corresponding draught of water is obtained as follows.\n\nFind the given number of tons in the scale KB, through which draw a line perpendicular to AB; then through the point of intersection of this line with the curve draw another line parallel to AB. Now the distance between A and the point where the parallel intersected AH being applied to the scale No 2, will give the draught of water required.\n\nAny other scale to which this scale may be applied will be obvious.\n\nBook II. Containing the Properties of Ships, &c.\n\nChap. I. Of the Equilibrium of Ships.\n\nSince the pressure of fluids is equal in every direction, the bottom of a ship is therefore acted upon by the fluid in which it is immersed; which pressure, for any given portion of surface, is equal to the product of that portion by the depth and density of the fluid; or it is equal to the weight of a column of the fluid whose base is the given surface, and the altitude equal to the distance between the surface of the fluid and the centre of gravity of the surface pressed. Hence a floating body is in equilibrium between two forces, namely, its gravity and the vertical pressure of the fluid; the horizontal pressure being destroyed.\n\nLet ABC (fig. 49.) be any body immersed in a fluid whose line of floatation is GH; hence the pressure of the fluid is exerted on every portion of the surface of the immersed part AFCH. Let EF, CD be any two small portions contained between the lines ED, FC, parallel to each other, and to the line of floatation GH: then\n\nthe pressure exerted upon EF is expressed by EF × IK, IK being the depth of EF or CD; the density of the fluid being supposed equal to r. In like manner the pressure upon CD is equal to CD × IK. Now since the pressure is in a direction perpendicular to the surface, draw therefore the line EL perpendicular to EF, and DM perpendicular to DC, and make each equal to the depth IK, below the surface. Now the effort or pressure of the fluid upon EF will be expressed by EF × EL, and that upon CD by CD × DM. Complete the parallelograms ON, QS, and the pressure in the direction EL is resolved into EN, EO, the first in a horizontal, and the second in a vertical direction. In like manner, the pressure in the direction DM is resolved into the pressures DS, DQ. Hence the joint effect of the pressures in the horizontal and vertical directions, namely, EF × EN, and EF × EO, will be equal to EF × EL:\n\nFor the same reason, CD × DP + CD × DQ = CD × DM. But the parts of the pressures in a horizontal direction EF × EN, and CD × DP, are equal. For, because of the similar triangles ENL, ERF, and DPM, DSC, we have \\[ \\frac{EL}{EN} = \\frac{EF}{FR} \\] and \\[ \\frac{DM}{DC} = \\frac{DC}{CS} \\]: Hence DM × CS = DP × DC, and EL × FR = EN × EF. Now since EL = DM, and FR = CS, therefore EL × FR = DM × CS = DP × DC = EN × EF. Hence since EF × EN = DP × CD, the effects of the pressures in a horizontal direction are therefore equal and contrary, and consequently destroy each other.\n\nThe pressure in a vertical direction is represented by EO × EF, DQ × DC, &c. which, because of the similar triangles EOL, ERF, and DLM, DSC, become EL × ER, DM × DS, &c. or IK × ER, IK × DS, &c. By applying the same reasoning to every other portion of the surface of the immersed part of the body, it is hence evident that the sum of the vertical pressures is equal to the sum of the corresponding displaced columns of the fluid.\n\nHence a floating body is pressed upwards by a force equal to the weight of the quantity of water displaced, and since there is an equilibrium between this force and that of the weight of the body, therefore the weight of a floating body is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid water difference (k). Hence also the centre of gravity of the body placed, and the centre of gravity of the displaced fluid are in the same vertical, otherwise the body would not be at rest.\n\nChap. II. Upon the Effects of the Water to bend a Vessel.\n\nWhen it is said that the pressure of the water upon the immersed part of a vessel counterbalances its weight, complete, it is supposed that the different parts of the vessel are so closely connected together, that the forces which act upon its surface are not capable of producing any change. For we may easily conceive, if the connection of the parts were not sufficiently strong, the vessel would run the risk either of being broken in pieces, or of suffering some alteration in its figure.\n\nThe vessel is in a situation similar to that of a rod AB.\n\n(k) Upon this principle the weight and tonnage of the 80 gun ship laid down were calculated.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nThe effects of AB (fig. 52.), which being acted upon by the forces Aa, Cc, Dd, Bb, may be maintained in equilibrium, provided it has a sufficient degree of stiffness; but as soon as it begins to give way, it is evident it must bend in a convex manner, since its middle would obey the forces Cc and Dd, while its extremities would be actually drawn downwards by the forces Aa and Bb.\n\nThe vessel is generally found in such a situation; and since similar efforts continually act whilst the vessel is immersed in the water, it happens too often that the keel experiences the bad effect of a strain. It is therefore very important to inquire into the true cause of this accident.\n\nFor this purpose, let us conceive the vessel to be divided into two parts by a transverse section through the vertical axis of the vessel, in which both the centre of gravity G (fig. 51.) of the whole vessel and that of the immersed part are situated; so that one of them will represent the head part, and the other that of the stern, each of which will be considered separately. Let g be the centre of gravity of the entire weight of the first, and o that of the immersed part corresponding. In like manner, let y be the centre of gravity of the whole after part, and w that of its immediate portion.\n\nNow it is plain, that the head will be acted upon by the two forces gm and om, of which the first will press it down, and the latter push it up. In the same manner, the stern will be pressed down by the force yu, and pushed by the force ow. But these four forces will maintain themselves in equilibrium, as well as the total forces reunited in the points G and O, which are equivalent to them; but whilst neither the forces before nor those behind fail in the same direction, the vessel will evidently sustain efforts tending to bend the keel upwards, if the two points ow are nearer the middle than the two other forces gm and yu. A contrary effect would happen if the points o and w were more distant from the middle than the points g and y.\n\nBut the first of these two causes usually takes place almost in all vessels, since they have a greater breadth towards the middle, and become more and more narrow towards the extremities; whilst the weight of the vessel is in proportion much more considerable towards the extremities than at the middle. From whence we see, that the greater this difference becomes, the more also will the vessel be subject to the forces which tend to bend its keel upwards. It is therefore from thence that we must judge how much strength it is necessary to give to this part of the vessel, in order to avoid such a consequence.\n\nIf other circumstances would permit either to load the vessel more in the middle, or to give to the part immersed a greater capacity towards the head and stern, such an effect would no longer be apprehended. But the diminution of most vessels is entirely opposite to such an arrangement; by which means we are obliged to strengthen the keel as much as may be necessary, in order to avoid such a disaster.\n\nWe shall conclude this chapter with the following practical observations on the hogging and sagging of ships by Mr Hutchinson of Liverpool:\n\n\"When ships with long floors happen to be laid adrift upon mud or sand, which makes a solid resistance against the long straight floors amidships, in comparison with the two sharp ends, the entrance and run meet with little support, but are pressed down lower than the flat of the floor, and in proportion hogs the ship amidstships; which is too well known from experience to occasion many total losses, or do so much damage by hogging them, as to require a vast deal of trouble and expense to save and repair them, so as to get the hog taken out and brought to their proper sheer again: and to do this the more effectually, the owners have often been induced to go to the expense of lengthening them; and by the common method, in proportion as they add to the burden of these ships, by lengthening their too long straight floors in their main bodies amidships, so much do they add to their general weakness to bear hardships either on the ground or afloat; for the scantling of their old timber and plank is not proportionable to bear the additional burden that is added to them.\n\n\"But defects of this kind are best proved from real and incontrovertible facts in common practice. At the very time I was writing upon this subject, I was called upon for my advice by the commander of one of those strong, long, straight floored ships, who was in much trouble and distraction of mind for the damage his ship had taken by the pilot laying her on a hard, gentle sloping land, at the outside of our docks at Liverpool, where it is common for ships that will take the ground to lie for a tide, when it proves too late to get into our wet docks. After recommending a proper ship carpenter, I went to the ship, which lay with only a small keel, yet was greatly hogged, and the butts of her upper works strained greatly on the lee side; and the seams of her bottom, at the lower futtock heads, vastly opened on the weather side: all which strained parts were agreed upon not to be caulked, but filled with tallow, putty, or clay, &c., with raw bullocks hides, or canvas nailed with battens on her bottom, which prevented her sinking with the flow of the tide, without hindering the prelude of water from righting and closing the seams again as she floated, so as to enable them to keep her free with pumping. This vessel, like many other instances of ships of this construction that I have known, was saved and repaired at a very great expense in our dry repairing docks. And that their bottoms not only hog upwards, but sag (or curve) downwards, to dangerous and fatal degrees, according to the strain or prelude that prevails upon them, will be proved from the following facts:\n\n\"It has been long known from experience, that when ships load deep with very heavy cargoes or materials that are flowed too low, it makes them so very laboursome at sea, when the waves run high, as to roll away their masts; and after that misfortune causes them to labour and roll the more, so as to endanger their working and straining themselves to pieces: to prevent which, it has been long a common practice to leave a great part of their fore and after holds empty, and to flow them as high as possible in the main body at midships, which causes the bottoms of these long straight-floored ships to sag downwards, in proportion as the weight of the cargo flowed there exceeds the prelude of the water upwards, so much as to make them dangerously and fatally leaky.\n\n\"I have known many instances of those strong ships of 500 or 600 tons burdens built with long straight floors, on the east coast of England, for the coal and timber trade, come loaded with timber from the Baltic...\"\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nEfforts of the Water to bend a Vessel.\n\nto Liverpool, where they commonly load deep with rock salt, which is too heavy to fill their holds, so that for the above reasons they flowed it high amidships, and left large empty spaces in their fore and after holds, which caused their long straight floors to sag downwards, so much as to make their hold stanchions amidships, at the main hatchway, settle from the beams three or four inches, and their mainmasts settle so much as to oblige them to set up the main rigging when rolling hard at sea, to prevent the masts being rolled away; and they were rendered so leaky as to be obliged to return to Liverpool to get their leaks flopped at great expense. And in order to save the time and expense in discharging them, endeavours were made to find out and stop their leaks, by laying them ahore dry on a level sand; but without effect: for though their bottoms were thus fagged down by their cargoes when afloat, yet when they came a-dry upon the land, some of their bottoms hogged upwards so much as to raise their mainmasts and pumps so high as to tear their coats from their decks; so that they have been obliged to discharge their cargoes, and give them a repair in the repairing dock, and in some to double their bottoms, to enable them to carry their cargoes with safety, flowed in this manner. From this cause I have known one of these strong ships to founder.\n\n\"Among the many instances of ships that have been distressed by carrying cargoes of lead, one failed from hence bound to Marseilles, which was soon obliged to put back again in great distress, having had four feet water in the hold, by the commander's account, owing to the ship's bottom faggging down to such a degree as made the hold stanchions settle six inches from the lower deck beams amidships; yet it is common with these long straight floored ships, when these heavy cargoes are discharged that make their bottoms sag down, then to hog upwards: so that when they are put into a dry repairing dock, with empty holds, upon straight blocks, they commonly either split the blocks close fore and aft, or damage their keels there, by the whole weight of the ship lying upon them, when none lies upon the blocks under the flat of their floors amidships, that being hogged upwards; which was the case of this ship's bottom; though fagged downwards six inches by her cargo, it was now found hogged so much that her keel did not touch the blocks amidships, which occasioned so much damage to the after part of the keel, as to oblige them to repair it; which is commonly the case with these ships, and therefore deserving particular notice.\"\n\nIn order to prevent these defects in ships, \"they should all be built with their floors or bottoms lengthwise, to form an arch with the projecting part downwards, which will naturally not only contribute greatly to prevent their taking damage by their bottoms hogging and straining upwards, either aground or afloat, as has been mentioned, but will, among other advantages, be a help to their sailing, steering, laying, and warping.\"\n\nCHAP. III. Of the Stability of Ships.\n\nWhen a vessel receives an impulse or pressure in a horizontal direction, so as to be inclined in a small degree, the vessel will then either regain its former position as the pressure is taken off, and is in this case said to be possessed of stability; or it will continue in stability of its inclined state; or, lastly, the inclination will increase until the vessel is overturned. With regard to the first case, it is evident that a sufficient degree of stability is necessary in order to sustain the efforts of the wind; but neither of the other two cases must be permitted to have place in vessels.\n\nLet CED (fig. 52.) be the section of a ship passing Fig. 53 through its centre of gravity, and perpendicular to the sheer and floor plans; which let be in equilibrium in a fluid; AB being the water line, G the centre of gravity of the whole body, and g that of the immersed part AEB. Let the body receive now a very small inclination, so that a Eb becomes the immersed part, and γ its centre of gravity. From γ draw γ M perpendicular to a b, and meeting g G, produced, if necessary, in M. If, then, the point M thus found is higher than G the centre of gravity of the whole body, the body will, in this case, return to its former position, the pressure being taken off. If the point M coincides with G, the vessel will remain in its inclined state; but if M be below G, the inclination of the vessel will continually increase until it is entirely overfet.\n\nThe point of intersection M is called the metacenter, and is the limit of the altitude of the centre of gravity of the whole vessel. Whence it is evident, from what has already been said, that the stability of the vessel increases with the altitude of the metacenter above the centre of gravity: But when the metacenter coincides with the centre of gravity, the vessel has no tendency whatever to move out of the situation into which it may be put. Thus, if the vessel be inclined either to the right or left side, it will remain in that position until a new force is impressed upon it: in this case, therefore, the vessel would not be able to carry sail, and is hence unfit for the purposes of navigation. If the metacenter is below the common centre of gravity, the vessel will instantly overturn.\n\nAs the determination of the metacenter is of the utmost importance in the construction of ships, it is therefore thought necessary to illustrate this subject more particularly.\n\nLet AEB (fig. 52.) be a section of a ship perpendicular to the keel, and also to the plane of elevation, and passing through the centre of gravity of the ship, and also through the centre of gravity of the immersed part, which let be g.\n\nNow let the ship be supposed to receive a very small inclination, so that the line of floatation is a, b, and γ the centre of gravity of the immersed part a Eb. From γ draw γ M perpendicular to a b, and intersecting GM in M, the metacenter, as before. Hence the pressure of the water will be in the direction γ M.\n\nIn order to determine the point M, the metacenter, the position of γ with respect to the lines AB and g G, must be previously ascertained. For this purpose, let the ship be supposed to be divided into a great number of sections by planes perpendicular to the keel, and parallel to each other, and to that formerly drawn, these planes being supposed equidistant. Let AEB (fig. 53) be one of these sections, g the centre of gravity of the immersed part before inclination, and γ the centre of gravity of the immersed part when the ship is in its inclined state; the distance g γ between the two centres\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nStability of gravity in each section is to be found. Let AB be the line of floatation of the ship when in an upright state, and a b the water line when inclined. Then, because the weight of the ship remains the same, the quantity of water displaced will also be the same in both cases, and therefore AEB = aEb, each sustaining the same part of the whole weight of the ship. From each of these take the part AEB, which is common to both, and the remainders AOa, BOb will be equal; and which, because the inclination is supposed very small, may be considered as rectilineal triangles, and the point O the middle of AB.\n\nNow, let H, I, K, be the centres of gravity of the spaces AOa, AEB, and BOb, respectively. From these points draw the lines Hh, II, and KK, perpendicular to AB, and let IL be drawn perpendicular to EO. Now to ascertain the distance γg of the centre of gravity γ of the part AEB from the line AB, the momentum of AEB with respect to this line must be put equal to the difference of the momentums of the parts AEB, AOa, which are upon different sides of AB*. Hence AEB × γg, or AEB × γg = AEB × Ii − AOa × Hh. But since g is the common centre of gravity of the two parts AEB, BOb, we have therefore AEB × γg = AEB × Ii + BOb × KK. Hence by expunging the term AEB × Ii from each of these equations, and comparing them, we obtain AEB × γg = AEB × γg = BOb × KK − AOa × Hh.\n\nNow, since the triangles AOa, BOb, are supposed infinitely small, their momentums or products, by the infinitely little lines Hh, KK, will also be infinitely small with respect to AEB × γg; which therefore being rejected, the former equation becomes AEB × γg = AEB × γg = BOb × KK. Hence the centres of gravity γ, γ, being at equal distances below AB, the infinitely little line γg is therefore perpendicular to EO. For the same reason γg, fig. 52, may be considered as an arch of a circle whose centre is M.\n\nTo determine the value of γg, the momentum of AEB with respect to EO must be taken, for the same reason as before, and put equal to the momentums of the two parts AOa, AEB; and we shall then have AEB × γg = AEB × γg = AEB × IL + AOa × OK. But since g is the common centre of gravity of the two spaces AEB, BOb, we shall have AEB × IL = BOb × OK = AOa × OK. Hence AEB × γg = BOb × OK + AOa × OK = BOb × OK; because the two triangles AOa, BOb are equal, and that the distances OK, OA, are also evidently equal.\n\nLet x be the thickness of the section represented by ABC. Then the momentum of this section will be 2 BOb × x × OK, which equation will also serve for each particular section.\n\nNow let f represent the sum of the momentums of all the sections. Hence f, AEB × x × γg = f, 2 BOb × x × OK. Now the first member being the sum of the momentums of each section, in proportion to a plane passing through the keel, ought therefore to be equal to the sum of all the sections, or to the volume of the immersed part of the bottom multiplied by the distance γg. Hence V representing the volume, we shall have V × γg = f, 2 BOb × x × OK.\n\nIn order to determine the value of the second member of this equation, it may be remarked, that when the ship is inclined, the original plane of floatation CBPO (fig. 54) becomes Cbpo. Now the triangles NI n, Stability of BOb, being the same as those in figures 52 and 53; and as each of these triangles has one angle equal, they Fig. 54 may, upon account of their infinite fineness, be considered as similar; and hence BOb : NI n : : OB : IN ; whence BOb = OB × NI n. Moreover, we have (fig. 53.) OB = OB, for the points K and k may be considered as equidistant from the point O; whence BOb × OK = OB × NI n.\n\nHence V × γg = f, OB × NI n. From this equation the value of γg is obtained.\n\nTo find the altitude gM (fig. 55.) of the meta-center above the centre of gravity of the immersed part of the bottom, let the arc NS be described from the centre I with the radius IN; then NI n = IN × NS / 2. Now since the two straight lines γg, gM are perpendicular to an and AN respectively, the angles M and NI n are therefore equal; and the infinitely little portion γγg which is perpendicular to gM, may be considered as an arch described from the centre M. Hence the two sectors NIS, gMγ are similar; and therefore gM : γγg : IN : NS. Hence NS = IN × γγg / gM; and consequently NI n = IN × γγg / 2 gM. Now this being substituted in the former equation, and reduced, we have V × γg = f, OB × NI n. But since gM and γγg are the same, whatever section may be under consideration, the equation may therefore be expressed thus, V × γg = f, OB × NI n. Hence gM = f, OB × NI n / V. Let y = OB, and the equation becomes gM = f, y × NI n / V.\n\nWhence to have the altitude of the metacenter above the centre of gravity of the immersed part of the bottom, the length of the section at the water-line must be divided by lines perpendicular to the middle line of this section into a great number of equal parts, so that the portion of the curve contained between any two adjacent perpendiculars may be considered as a straight line. Then the sum of the cubes of the half perpendiculars or ordinates is to be multiplied by the distance between the perpendiculars, and two-thirds of the product is to be divided by the volume of the immersed part of the bottom of the ship.\n\nIt is hence evident, that while the sector at the water-line is the same, and the volume of the immersed part of the bottom remains also the same, the altitude of the metacenter will remain the same, whatever may be the figure of the bottom.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of the Centre of Gravity of the immersed Part of the Bottom of a Ship.\n\nThe centre of gravity * of a ship, supposed homogeneous, and in an upright position in the water, is in a vertical\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nCentre of vertical section passing through the keel, and dividing the ship into two equal and similar parts, at a certain distance from the stern, and altitude above the heel.\n\nIn order to determine the centre of gravity of the immersed part of a ship's bottom, we must begin with determining the centre of gravity of a section of the ship parallel to the keel, as ANDFPB (fig. 56.), bounded by the parallel lines AB, DF, and by the equal and similar curves AND, BPF.\n\nIf the equation of this curve were known, its centre of gravity would be easily found; but as this is not the case, let therefore the line CE be drawn through the middle C, E, of the lines AB, DF, and let this line CE be divided into a great number of equal parts by the perpendiculars TH, KM, &c., that the arches of the curves contained between the extremities of any two adjacent perpendiculars may be considered as straight lines. The momentums of the trapeziums DTHF, TKMH, &c., relative to the point E, are then to be found, and the sum of these momentums is to be divided by the sum of the trapeziums, that is, by the surface ANDFPB.\n\nThe distance of the centre of gravity of the trapezium THFD from the point E is\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (DF + 2TH) \\]\n\nFor the same reason, and because of the equality of the lines IE, IL, the distance of the centre of gravity of the trapezium TKMH from the same point E will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (TH + 2KM) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (TH + 2KM) + 1E, \\text{ or } \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (4TH + 3KM) \\]\n\nIn like manner, the distance of the centre of gravity of the trapezium NKMP from the point E will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (KM + 2NP) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (7KM + 8NP) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (7KM + 8NP) + 2IE, \\text{ or } \\frac{1}{2} IE \\times (7KM + 8NP) \\]\n\n&c.\n\nNow, if each distance be multiplied by the surface of the corresponding trapezium, that is, by the product of half the sum of the two opposite sides of the trapezium into the common altitude IE, we shall have the momentums of these trapeziums, namely,\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE^2 \\times (DF + 2TH), \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE^2 \\times (4TH + 3KM), \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE^2 \\times (7KM + 8NP), \\]\n\n&c. Hence the sum of these momentums will be\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE^2 \\times (DF + 2TH + 4TH + 3KM + 8NP + 24QS + 14AB). \\]\n\nWhence it may be remarked, that if the line CE be divided into a great number of equal parts, the factor or coefficient of the last term, which is here 14, will be \\(2 + 3(n-2)\\) or \\(3n - 4\\), \\(n\\) being the number of perpendiculars. Thus the general expression of the sum of the momentums is reduced to\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} IE^2 \\times (\\frac{1}{2} DF + TH + 2KM + 3NP + 4QS + \\ldots + \\frac{3n-4}{6} \\times AB). \\]\n\nThe area of the figure ANDFPB is equal to\n\n\\[ IE \\times (\\frac{1}{2} DF + TH + KM + NP + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{2} AB); \\]\n\nhence the distance EG of the centre of gravity G from one of the extreme ordinates DF is equal to\n\n\\[ IE \\times (\\frac{1}{2} DF + TH + 2KM + 3NP + \\ldots + \\frac{3n-4}{6} \\times AB) \\]\n\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} DF + TH + KM + NP + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{2} AB \\]\n\nWhence the following rule to find the distance of the centre of gravity G from one of the extreme ordinates DF. To the fifth of the first ordinate add the fifth of the last ordinate multiplied by three times the number of ordinates minus four; then the second ordinate, twice the third, three times the fourth, &c. &c., the sum will be a first term. Then to half the sum of the extreme ordinates add all the intermediate ones, and the sum will be a second term. Now the first term divided by the second, and the quotient multiplied by the interval between two adjacent perpendiculars, will be the distance sought.\n\nThus, let there be seven perpendiculars, whose values are 18, 23, 28, 30, 32, 21, 9 feet respectively, and the common interval between the perpendiculars 20 feet. Now the fifth of the first term is 3; and as the last term is 9, therefore to 3 add 23, twice 28 or 56, thrice 30 or 90, four times 30 or 120, five times 21 or 105; and the sum is 397. Then to the half of 18+9, or 9, add the intermediate ordinates, and the sum will be 141. Now \\( \\frac{397 \\times 20}{141} = \\frac{7940}{141} = 59 \\) feet four inches nearly, the distance of the centre of gravity from the first ordinate.\n\nNow, when the centre of gravity of any section is determined, it is easy from thence to find the centre of gravity of the solid, and consequently that of the bottom of a ship.\n\nThe next step is to find the height of the centre of gravity of the bottom above the keel. For this purpose the bottom must be imagined to be divided into sections by planes parallel to the keel or water-line, above the (figs. 57, 58.). Then the solidity of each portion contained between two parallel planes will be equal to half the sum of the two opposed surfaces multiplied by the distance between them; and its centre of gravity will be at the same altitude as that of the trapezium abcd, (fig. 58.), which is in the vertical section passing through the keel. It is hence obvious, that the same rule as before is to be applied to find the altitude of the centre of gravity, with this difference only, that the word perpendicular or ordinate is to be changed into section. Hence the rule is, to the fifth part of the lowest section add the product of the sixth part of the uppermost section by three times the number of sections minus four; the second section in ascending twice the third, three times the fourth, &c., the sum will be a first term. To half the sum of upper and lower sections add the intermediate ones, the sum will be a second term. Divide the first term by the second, and the quotient multiplied by the distance between the sections will give the altitude of the centre of gravity above the keel.\n\nWith regard to the centre of gravity of a ship, whether it is considered as loaded or light, the operation becomes more difficult. The momentum of every different part of the ship and cargo must be found separately with respect to a horizontal and also a vertical plane. Now the sums of these two momentums being divided by the weight of the ship, will give the altitude of the centre of gravity, and its distance from the vertical plane; and as this centre is in a vertical plane passing through the axis of the keel, its place is therefore determined. In the calculation of the momentums, it must be observed to multiply the weight, and not the magnitude of each piece, by the distance of its centre of gravity.\n\nA more easy method of finding the centre of gravity of\nof a ship is by a mechanical operation, as follows: Construct a block of as light wood as possible, exactly similar to the parts of the proposed draught or ship, by a scale of about one-fourth of an inch to a foot. The block is then to be suspended by a silk-thread or very fine line, placed in different situations until it is found to be in a state of equilibrium, and the centre of gravity will be pointed out. The block may be proved by fastening the line which suspends it to any point in the line joining the middles of the stem and post, and weights are to be suspended from the extremities of this middle line at the stem and post. If, then, the block be properly constructed, a plane passing through the line of suspension, and the other two lines, will also pass through the keel, stem, and post. Now, the block being suspended in this manner from any point in the middle line, a line is to be drawn on the block parallel to the line of suspension, so that the plane passing through these two lines may be perpendicular to the vertical plane of the ship in the direction of the keel. The line by which the block is suspended is then to be removed to some other convenient point in the middle line; and another line is to be drawn on the block parallel to the line suspending it, as before. Then the point of intersection of this line with the former will give the position of the centre of gravity on the block, which may now be laid down in the draught.\n\n**CHAP. V.

Determination of the Centre of Gravity of the eighth Plane.\n\nThis plane is equal in length to the seventh horizontal plane, and its breadth is equal to that of the keel. The distance between the seventh and eighth planes is three feet, but which is here taken equal to 2 feet 11½ inches.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nCentre of Distance between the aft side of the post and Gravity.\n\nFourteen intervals between the fifteen ordinates, each interval being 10.03 feet\n\nDistance of the last ordinate from the fore foot\n\nHence the length of the eighth plane is\n\nWhich multiplied by the breadth\n\nThe product is the area of this plane\n\nThe distance of its centre of gravity from the aft side of the post, being equal to half its length, is\n\nThe centres of gravity of these eight planes being found, the distance of the centre of gravity of the bottom of the ship from the aft side of the post, and also its altitude, may from thence be easily determined.\n\nFrom the principles already explained, the distance of the centre of gravity of the bottom from the aft side of the post, is equal to the sum of the momentums of an infinite number of horizontal planes, divided by the sum of these planes, or, which is the same, by the solidity of the bottom. As, however, we have no more than eight planes, we must therefore conceive their momentums as the ordinates of a curve, whose distances may be the same as that of the horizontal planes. Now the sum of these ordinates minus half the sum of the extreme ordinates being multiplied by their distance, gives the surface of the curve; of which any ordinate whatever represents the momentum of the horizontal plane at the same altitude as these ordinates; and the whole surface will represent the sum of the momentums of all the horizontal planes.\n\nNow \\( \\frac{110079.96}{23898.27} \\times 2.95 = 13.588 \\), the height of the centre of gravity of the bottom of the ship above the lower edge of the keel.\n\nWe have now found the distance of the centre of gravity of the bottom of the ship from the aft side of the post, and its altitude above the lower edge of the keel. Hence the ship being supposed in an upright position, this centre of gravity will necessarily be in the vertical longitudinal section which divides the ship into two equal and similar parts; the position of this centre is therefore determined.\n\nIt now remains to find the height of the metacentre above the centre of gravity; the expression for this altitude, as found in Chap. III., is \\( \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{V}} \\) which we shall now apply to determine the metacentre of the ship, above the 74 guns, whose centre of gravity we have already found.\n\n| Ord. of the Plane of Floatation | Cub. of Ordinates |\n|---------------------------------|------------------|\n| Feet.

Thus,\n\nTo one-sixth of the lowermost horizontal section add the product of one-sixth of the uppermost section by three times the number of sections minus four the second section in ascending, twice the third, three times the fourth, &c.; and to half the sum of the extreme planes add all the intermediate ones. Now the first of these sums, multiplied by the distance between the planes or sections, and divided by the second sum, gives the altitude of the centre of gravity of the bottom of the ship above the lower edge of the keel as required.\n\nOrdinate at 10.03 feet abaft the ordinate 8g=4, of which the cube is 64, and \\( 64 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nOrdinate at 10.03 feet afore the ordinate G o=6, cube of which is 216 and \\( 216 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nSum\n\nDifference between the ordinates\n\nProduct\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nIn the valuable work to which we have just referred, Appendix, the following directions are given for cutting sails.\n\n\"The width and depth being given, find the number of cloths the width requires, allowing for seams, tabling on the leeches, and slack cloth; and, in the depth, allow for tabling on the head and foot. For sails cut square on the head and foot, with gores only on the leeches, as some topmasts, &c., the cloths on the head, between the leeches, are cut square to the depth; and the gores on the leeches are found by dividing the depth of the sail by the number of cloths gored, which gives the length of each gore. The gore is set down from a square with the opposite selvage; and the canvas being cut diagonally, the longest gored side of one cloth makes the shortest side of the next; consequently, the first gore being known, the rest are cut by it. In the leeches of topmasts cut hollow, the upper gores are longer than the lower ones; and in sails cut with a roach leech, the lower gores are longer than the upper ones. This must be regulated by judgment, and care taken that the whole of the gores do not exceed the depth of the leech. Or, by drawing on paper the gored side of the sail, and delineating the breadth of every cloth by a convenient scale of equal parts of an inch to a foot, the length of every gore may be found with precision. Sails, gored with a sweep on the head or the foot, or on both, have the depth of their gores marked on the selvage, from the square of the given depth on each cloth, and are cut as above; the longest selvage of one serving to measure the shortest selvage of the next, beginning with the first gored cloth next the middle in some sails, and the first cloth next to the mast leech in others. For those gores that are irregular no strict rule can be given; they can only be determined by the judgment of the sail-maker, or by a drawing.\n\n\"In the royal navy, mizen topmasts are cut with three quarters of a yard hollow in the foot; but, in the merchant service, top and topgallant sails are cut with more or less hollow in the foot. Flying jibs are cut and sewn with a roach curve on the stay, and a three-inch gore margin in each cloth, shortening from the tack to the clew. Lower fludding-sails are cut with square leeches, and topmast and topgallant-mast fludding sails with goering leeches.\n\n\"The length of reef and middle bands is governed by the width of the sail at their respective places; the leech-linings, buntline-cloths, top linings, mast-cloths, and corner-pieces, are cut agreeably to the depth of the sail; each cloth and every article should be properly marked with charcoal, to prevent confusion or mistake. Sails that have bonnets are cut out the whole depth of the sail and bonnet included, allowing enough for the tablings on the foot of the sail and head and foot of the bonnet. The bonnet is cut off after the sail is sewed together. If a dribler is required, it is allowed for in the cutting out the same as the bonnet.\n\nWhen the cloth is thus properly cut, the different pieces are to be joined together in the form of a sail; and for doing this properly we have the following directions in the work already quoted. \"Sails have a double flat seam, and should be sewed with the best English made twine of three threads, spun 360 fathoms to the pound, and have from one hundred and eight to one hundred and sixteen stitches in every yard in length. The twine for large sails, in the royal navy, is waxed...\"\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nAppendix, by hand, with genuine bees wax, mixed with one sixth part of clear turpentine; and, for small sails, in a mixture made with bees wax, 4 lb. hogs lard 5 lb. and clear turpentine 1 lb. In the merchant service, the twine is dipped in tar (L), softened with a proper proportion of oil.\n\n\"It is the erroneous practice of some sailmakers not to sew the seams any farther than where the edge is creased down for the tabling; but all sails should be sewed quite home to the end, and, when finished, should be well rubbed down with a rubber. In the merchant service sails are sometimes made broader at the foot than at the head, being stronger. Broad sails are not allowed to be made on courses, in the royal navy, but going leeches are adopted in lieu of them. Boom main sails and the sails of floops generally have the sails broader at the foot than at the head. The sails of courses and topsails are stuck or stitched up, in the middle of the sails, along the whole length, with double seaming twine; and have from 68 to 72 stitches in a yard. In the merchant service it is common to stick the sails with two rows of stitches, when the sail is half worn, as they will then last till the sail is worn out.\n\n\"The breadth of the sails of courses, topsails, and other sails, in the royal navy, to be as follow, viz. courses and topsails, for 50 gun ships and upwards, one inch and a half; and for 44 gun ships and under, one inch and a quarter, at head and foot; all other sails, one inch at head and foot.\n\n\"The tablings of all sails are to be of a proportionable breadth to the size of the sail, and sewed at the edge, with 68 to 72 stitches in a yard. Those for the heads of main and fore courses to be four to five inches wide; for sprit courses and mizens, drivers, and other boom sails, 3 to 4 inches wide; for topsails, 3 inches to 4 inches and a half; topgallant and sprit topsails, 3 inches; royal sails, 2 inches and a half; jib and other staysails, 3 inches to 4 inches and a half, on the stay or hoist; and for studding sails, 3 inches to 4 inches on the head. Tablings on the foot and leeches of main and fore courses to be 3 inches to 5 inches broad; sprit course and topsails, 3 inches; topgallant and sprit topsails, 2 inches and a half; royals, 2 inches; fore leeches of mizen, driver, and other boom sails, 3 inches and a half to 4 inches; after leech, 3 inches; and on the foot 2 or 3 inches. Tablings on the after leech of jibs and other staysails to be from 2 to 3 inches broad; and, on the foot, 2 to 2 inches and a half; on studding sail leeches one inch and a half to two inches and a half; and on the foot, from one to two inches.\n\n\"Main and fore courses are lined on the leeches, from clue to earing, with one cloth sewed on and stuck or stitched in the middle, and have a middle band half way between the lower reef band and the foot, also four buntline cloths, at equal distances between the leeches, the upper ends of which are carried under the middle band, that the lower side of the band may be tacked upon or sewed over the end of the buntline pieces. They have likewise two reef bands; each in breadth one third of the breadth of the canvas; the upper one is one sixth of the depth of the sail from the head, and the lower band is at the same distance from the upper one; the ends go four inches under the leech linings, which are sewed over the reef bands. All linings are sewed on, and are stuck with 68 to 72 stitches in a yard.\n\n\"Main, fore, and mizen, topsails have leech linings, mast and top linings, buntline cloths, middle bands and reef bands. The leech linings are made of one breadth of cloth, to cut and sewed as to be half a cloth broad at the head, and a cloth and a half broad at the foot; the piece cut out being half the breadth of the cloth at one end, and tapering to a point at the other. The middle bands are put on half way between the lower reef and foot, the buntline cloths join the top linings, and the buntline cloths and top linings are carried up to the lower side of the middle band, which is tacked on them. The mast lining is of two cloths, and extends from the foot of the sail to the lower reef, to receive the beat or chafe of the mast. The middle band is made of one breadth of canvas, of the same number as the top lining. It is first folded and rubbed down, to make a crease at one third of the breadth; then tacked on the selvage, and stuck along the crease; then turned down, and tacked and stuck through both the double and single parts, with 68 to 72 stitches in a yard. It is the opinion of many, that middle bands should not be put on until the sail is half worn.\n\n\"Main and fore topsails have three and sometimes four reef bands from leech to leech, over the leech linings; the upper one is one eighth of the depth of the sail from the head, and they are the same distance abeam in the royal navy, but more in the merchant service. The reef bands are each of half a breadth of canvas put on double; the first side is stuck twice, and the last turned over, so that the reef holes may be worked upon the double part of the band, which is also stuck with 68 to 72 stitches in a yard.\n\n\"The top lining of topsails is of canvas, No 6 or 7. The other linings of this, and all the linings of other sails, should be of the same quality as the sails to which they belong.\n\n\"Top-linings and mast cloths are put on the aft side, and all other linings on the fore side, of sails. Mizens are lined with one breadth of cloth from the clue five yards up the leech, and have a reef band sewed on, in the same manner as on other sails, at one fifth the depth of the sail from the foot; they have also a cock-piece and a peak-piece, one cut out of the other, so that each contains one yard. Mizen topsails of 50 gun ships and upwards have three reefs, the upper one is one eighth of the depth of the sail from the head, and the reefs are at the same distance abeam. Mizen topsails of ships of 44 guns and under have two reefs one seventh part of the depth of the sail abeam, the upper one being at the same distance from the head. Main and main top studding sails have each one reef, at one eighth of the depth of the sail from the head. Reef bands should not be put on until the sail is sewed up, a contrary practice being very erroneous. Lower staysails,\n\n(t.) The dipping of the twine in tar, we are persuaded, is a very bad practice, for the reason assigned in ROPE-MAKING. See that article, No 32.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nPlate CCCCLXXXIV.\n\nFig. 1.\nPIECES of the HULL.\n\nFig. 2.\nFRAMES of a SHIP.\n\nE Mitchell sculp.\nSHIP-BUILDING.\n\nAppendix. fails, fore top and main top stayfails, and flying jibs, have clue-pieces two yards long. Square tack stayfails, have half a breadth of cloth at the fore part, with a clue-piece containing two yards, and a peek-piece, containing one yard.\n\n\"Sails have two holes in each cloth, at the heads and reefs of courses, topfails, and other square sails; one hole in every yard in the stay of flying jibs, and one in every three quarters of a yard in the stays of square tack and other stayfails. These are made by an instrument called a pegging awl, or a stabber, and are fenced round by stitching the edge to a small grommet, made with log or other line; when finished, they should be well stretched or rounded up by a pricker or a marline spike. Reef and head holes of large sails have grommets of twelve-thread line, worked round with 18 to 21 stitches; smaller sails have grommets of nine-thread line, with 16 to 18 stitches, or as many as shall cover the line, and smaller holes in proportion. The holes for marling the clues of fails and the top brims of topfails have grommets of log-line, and should have from 9 to 11 stitches; twelve holes are worked in each cloth. Main courses have marling holes from the clue to the lower bow line cringle up the leech, and from the clue to the first buntline cringle on the foot. Fore courses have marling holes one eighth of the depth of the fail up the leech, and from the clue to the first buntline cringle at the foot. Main and fore topfails have marling holes three feet each way from the clue and at the top-brims. Spritfails, mizen topfails, lower stayfails, main and fore top stayfails, and jibs, have marling holes two feet each way from the clues. All other fails are sewed home to the clues. Marling holes of courses are at three fourths of the depth of the tablings at the clues from the rope, and those of topfails are at half the depth of the tablings at the clues and top brim from the rope.\"\n\nThe rope, which is sewed on the edges of fails to prevent their rending, and which is called bolt-rope, should be well made of fine yarn, spun from the best Riga rhine hemp well topt, and sewed on with good English made twine of three threads, spun 200 fathom to the pound; the twine in the royal navy is dipped in a composition made with bees-wax, 4 lbs. hogs lard Appendix, 5 lbs. and clear turpentine one pound; and in the merchant service, in tar softened with oil. They should be sloved in a stove by the heat of a flue, and not in a baker's oven or a stove tub; and tarred in the best Stockholm tar. The flexibility of them should be always considered, in taking in the slack, which must rest on the judgment of the sailmaker.\n\n\"Bolt ropes of courses, topfails, and all other fails, should be neatly sewed on through every buntline of the rope; and, to avoid stretching, the rope must be kept tightly twisted while sewing on, and care taken that neither too much nor too little slack is taken in; they are to be cros stitched at the leechees every twelve inches in length; at every seam, and in the middle of every cloth at the foot, with three cros-stitches; four cros-stitches should be taken at all beginnings and fastenings off; the first stitch given twice, and the last three times. Small sails have two cros stitches at every seam, and three at every fastening off.\n\n\"On main and fore courses two inches slack cloth should be allowed in the head and foot, and one inch and a half in the leechees, in every yard in length. Topfails are allowed 3 inches slack in every cloth in the foot, one inch and a half in every yard in the leech, and two inches in every cloth left open in the top brim. Mizen courses have two inches slack in every yard in the foremost leech, but none in the after leech or foot. Spritfail courses have no slack cloth. Jibs have four inches slack in every yard in the stay, one inch in every cloth in the foot, and none in the leech. Stayfails have three inches slack in every yard in the stay, one inch in every cloth in the foot, but none in the leech. Toppallant fails have two inches slack in every cloth in the foot, and one inch in every yard in the leech. Studding fails have an inch and a half slack in every yard in gorung leechees, but no slack in square leechees, and one inch in every cloth in the head and foot.\"\n\nThese directions for sailmaking, we trust may be useful. They are indeed very general, but the sailmaker will find every instruction that he can want in the Elements of Rigging and Seamanship, a work which we therefore recommend to his attention.\n\nSHIP'S FORM GAUGE, an instrument recommended by Mr Hutchinson as fit to ascertain any alteration in the bottom of a ship, by its hogging or sagging; and also to regulate the flowage of a ship.\n\n\"All ships (says he) of any consequence are built with stanchions fixed from the keel to the middle of all the lower-deck beams fore and aft, in order to support them in their exact regular height, as well as the whole frame of the ship in the regular form in which she was built upon the stocks; yet notwithstanding these stanchions, it is proved from experience that our ships bottoms, hitherto, by the pressure of water, and improper flowage, have generally been hogged upwards, or sagged downwards, and most about the midship frame or main body of the ship, which is commonly about the fore part of the main hatchway; which naturally makes it the best place at which to fix the ship's form gauge, where either the hogging or sagging of her bottom may be observed and seen soonest and best, to regulate the flowage of heavy materials to the greatest advantage, so as to keep her bottom nearly in the same form in which she was built.\n\n\"The gauge I recommend is nothing more than a narrow plate of iron divided into inches and quarters, like the slide of a carpenter's rule. Let this be fixed to the after side of the stanchion now mentioned, with its upper end projecting two or three inches above the stanchion; a groove being cut out for it in the after side of the lower-deck beam, and a mark being made (when the ship is on the stocks) at the part of the beam which corresponds to the o on the gauge. When the ship alters in her shape, the gauge will slide up and down.\"\ndown in this groove, and the quantity of hogging or sagging will be pointed out on the gauge by the mark on the beam. The stowage may then be so managed as to bring this mark to coincide again with the o, or to approach it as near as we see necessary.\n\nSHIP-Money, was an imposition charged upon the ports, towns, cities, boroughs, and counties of this realm, in the reign of King Charles I. by writs, commonly called ship-writs, under the great seal of England, in the years 1635 and 1636, for the providing and furnishing of certain ships for the king's service, &c., which was declared to be contrary to the laws and statutes of this realm, the petition of right and liberty of the subject, by stat. 17 Car. I. c. 14. See Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. iv. p. 320.\n\nSHIP-Shape, according to the fashion of a ship, or in the manner of an expert sailer; as, the mast is not rigged ship-shape; Trim your sails ship-shape.\n\nStowing and Trimming of SHIPS, the method of disposing of the cargo in a proper and judicious manner in the hold of a ship.\n\nA ship's sailing, steering, laying, and wearing, and being lively and comparatively easy at sea in a storm, depends greatly on the cargo, ballast, or other materials, being properly stowed, according to their weight and bulk, and the proportional dimensions of the built of the ship, which may be made too crank or too stiff to pass on the ocean with safety. These things render this branch of knowledge of such consequence, that rules for it ought to be endeavoured after, if but to prevent, as much as possible, the danger of a ship overfilling at sea, or being so labourious as to roll away her masts, &c., by being improperly stowed, which is often the case.\n\nWhen a ship is new, it is prudent to consult the builder, who may be supposed best acquainted with a ship of his own planning, and most likely to judge what her properties will be, to advise how the cargo or materials, according to the nature of them, ought to be disposed of to advantage, so as to put her in the best sailing trim; and at every favourable opportunity afterwards it will be proper to endeavour to find out her best trim by experiment.\n\nShips must differ in their form and proportional dimensions; and to make them answer their different purposes, they will require different management in the stowage, which ought not to be left to mere chance, or done at random, as goods or materials happen to come to hand, which is too often the cause that such improper stowage makes ships unfit for sea; therefore the stowage should be considered, planned, and contrived, according to the build and properties of the ship, which if they are not known should be inquired after. If she is narrow and high-built in proportion, so that she will not shift herself without a great weight in the hold, it is a certain sign such a ship will require a great part of heavy goods, ballast, or materials, laid low in the hold, to make her stiff enough to bear sufficient sail without being in danger of overfilling. But if a ship be built broad and low in proportion, so that she is stiff and will support herself without any weight in the hold, such a ship will require heavy goods, ballast, or materials, stowed higher up, to prevent her from being too stiff and labourious at sea, so as to endanger her masts being rolled away, and the hull worked loose and made leaky.\n\nIn order to help a ship's sailing, that she should be lively and easy in her pitching and ascending motions, it should be contrived by the stowage, that the principal and weightiest part of the cargo or materials should lie as near the main body of the ship, and as far from the extreme ends, fore and aft, as things will admit of: For it should be considered, that the roomy part of our ships lengthwise forms a sweep or curve near four times as long as they are broad; therefore those roomy parts at and above the water's edge, which are made by a full harping and a broad transom to support the ship steady and keep her from plunging into the sea, and also by the entrance and run of the ship having little or no bearing body under for the pressure of the water to support them, of course should not be stowed with heavy goods or materials, but all the necessary vacancies, broken stowage, or light goods, should be at these extreme ends fore and aft; and in proportion as they are kept lighter by the stowage, the ship will be more lively to fall and rise easy in great seas; and this will contribute greatly to her working and sailing, and to prevent her from straining and hogging; for which reason it is a wrong practice to leave such a large vacancy in the main hatchway, as is usual, to coil and work the cables, which ought to be in the fore or after hatchway, that the principal weight may be more easily stowed in the main body of the ship, above the flattest and lowest floorings, where the pressure of the water acts the more to support it.\n\nImproved Capstan of SHIPS.—A capstan has been contrived by Mr. Bofwell, which works without requiring the messenger or cable coiled around it, to be ever surged; an operation which is necessary with common capstans, and is always attended with delay, and frequently with danger. This capstan has been approved by some gentlemen connected with the British navy. A model of this machine was presented to the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, and Mr. Bofwell received the gold medal of the society for his invention.*\n\nFor the information of those unacquainted with maritime affairs, Mr. Bofwell gives an account of the manner in which cables are hauled on board of large ships. For the purpose of shewing the advantage of his improved capstan, cables, he observes, above a certain diameter are too inflexible to admit of being coiled round a capstan; in ships where cables of such large dimensions are necessary, a smaller cable is employed for this purpose, which is called the messenger, the two ends of which are made fast together so as to form an endless rope, which, as the capstan is turned about, rolls round it in unceasing succession, passing on its course to the head of the ship, and again returning to the capstan. To this returning part of the messenger, the great cable is made fast by a number of small ropes called nippers, placed at regular intervals; these nippers are applied, as the cable enters the hawse hole, and are again removed as it approaches the capstan, after which it is lowered into the cable tier.\n\nThe messenger, or any other rope coiled round the capstan, must descend a space at every revolution equal to the diameter of the rope or cable used; this circumstance\n\n* Transf. for 1807 Phil. Mag. xxxi. 267.\nflance brings the coils in a few turns to the bottom of the capstan, when it can no longer be turned round, till the coils are loosed and raised up to its other extremity, after which the motion proceeds as before. This operation of shifting the place of the coils of the messenger on the capstan is called surging the messenger. It always causes considerable delay; and when the messenger chances to slip in changing its position, which sometimes happens, no small danger is incurred by those who are employed about the capstan.\n\nOne method of preventing the necessity of surging, by placing a horizontal roller beneath the messenger when it first enters on the capstan, adds considerably to the labour in turning the capstan, and the great friction which the messenger must suffer, must occasion a very great wear and injury to the messenger.\n\nAnother method to prevent surging was, that for which Mr Plucknet obtained a patent. In this way a number of upright lifters, placed round the capstan, were made to rise in succession as the capstan turned round by a circular inclined plane placed beneath them; a method Mr Botwell thinks superior to the former; but still the wear of the messenger from the lateral friction is rising against the whelps of the capstan remains undiminished.\n\nA third method proposed by Captain Hamilton, left the lateral friction, and wear of the messenger against the whelps of the capstan, as great as in the others, having also the inconvenience of causing the coils to become loose as they ascend, the upper part of the barrel being nearly one third less in the diameter than the lower part.\n\nIn Mr Botwell's method of preventing the necessity of surging, none of the lateral friction of the messenger or cable against the whelps of the capstan, can possibly take place, and of course the wear of the messenger occasioned thereby will be entirely avoided, while it performs its purpose with a less moving power than any of them.\n\nHis method consists in the simple addition of a second smaller barrel or capstan of less dimensions to the large one; beside which it is to be placed in a similar manner, and which need not in general exceed the size of a half barrel cask. The coils of the messenger are to be passed alternately round the large capstan and this small barrel, but with their direction reversed in the different barrels, so that they may cross each other in the intervals between the barrels, in order to have the more extensive contact with, and better grip on each barrel. To keep the coils distinct, and prevent their touching each other in passing from one barrel to the other, projecting rings are fastened round each barrel at a distance from each other equal to about two diameters of the messenger, and the thickness of the ring. Those rings should be fixed on the two barrels that those on one barrel should be exactly opposite the middle of the intervals between those on the other barrel; the only circumstance which requires particular attention in the construction of this capstan. The rings should project about as much as the messenger from the barrels, which may be formed with whelps, and in every other respect, not before mentioned, in the usual manner for capstan barrels. The small barrel should be furnished with falling palls as well as the large one; a fixed iron spindle ascending from the deck will be the best for it, as it will take up less room. The spindle may be secured below the deck, so as to bear any strain, as the small barrel need not be much above half the height of the large barrel; the capstan bars can easily pass over it in heaving round, when it is thought fit to use capstan bars on the same deck with the small barrel. As two turns of the messenger round both barrels will be at least equivalent to three turns round the common capstan, it will scarcely ever be necessary to use more than four turns round the two barrels.\n\nThat which prevents the lateral friction of the messenger in Mr Botwell's double capstan is, that in it each coil is kept distinct from the rest, and must pass on to the second barrel before it can gain the next elevation on the hill, by which no one coil can have any influence in raising or depressing another; and what each separate coil descends in a single revolution it regains as much as is necessary in its passage between the barrels when in the air, and free from all contact with any part of the apparatus, it attains a higher elevation without a possibility of friction or wear.\n\nIt is equally applicable in large and in smaller vessels, in the former of which messengers are necessary, from the size of the cables; but in the latter also, where cables can be managed with the same ease as messengers. The same principle may be also easily applied to windlasses by having a small horizontal barrel placed parallel to the body of the windlass, and having both fitted with rings in the same way as is proposed for the capstan. The place for the small horizontal barrel is forward, just before the windlass, and it should also be furnished with catch polls.\n\nBesides the advantages now stated, the improved capstan is simple in its construction can be fitted up at small expense, is easily repaired, and requires but little room.\n\nA represents the common capstan; B, another of smaller dimensions; C the coils of the messenger passing alternately round the large and small capstans, but with the direction reversed on the different barrels, so that they may cross each other in the interval between them; DDDD, are projecting rings round each barrel, so fixed on the two barrels, that those on one barrel should be exactly opposite the middle of the intervals between those on the other barrel.\n\nMachine for measuring a Ship's Way.—We have already described a variety of machines or instruments which have been proposed for this purpose under the article Log. In this place, therefore, we shall confine ourselves to the machine invented by Francis Hopkinson, Esq. Judge of the Admiralty in Pennsylvania. After having shown the fallacies to which the common log, and also that particular kind of instrument invented by M. Saumarez, are liable, he proceeds to describe his own machine as follows:\n\nThis machine, in its most simple form, is represented by fig. 5, wherein AB is a strong rod of iron moveable on the fulcrum C. D is a thin circular palate of brass rivetted to the lower extremity of the rod. E a horizontal arm connected at one end with the top of the rod AB by a moveable joint F, and at the other end with the bottom of the index H, by a like moveable joint G. H is the index turning on its centre I, and travelling over the graduated arch K; and L is a strong spring, bearing against the rod AB, and constantly counteracting the pressure upon the palate D.\nThe rod AB should be applied close to the cut-water or stem, and should be of such a length that the palate D may be no higher above the keel than is necessary to secure it from injury when the vessel is aground, or fails in shoal water. As the bow of the ship curves inward towards the keel M, the palate D will be thrown to a distance from the bottom of the vessel, although the perpendicular rod to which it is annexed lies close to the bow above; and therefore the palate will be more fairly acted upon. The arm E should enter the bow somewhere near the hawse hole, and lead to any convenient place in the forecastle, where a smooth board or plate may be fixed, having the index H, and graduated arch K, upon it.\n\nIt is evident from the figure, that as the ship is urged forward by the wind, the palate D will be pressed upon by the resisting medium, with a greater or less force, according to the progressive motion of the ship; and this will operate upon the levers so as to immediately affect the index, making the least increase or diminution of the ship's way visible on the graduated arch; the spring L always counteracting the pressure upon the palate, and bringing back the index, on any relaxation of the force impelled.\n\nThis machine is advantageously placed at the bow of the ship, where the current first begins, and acts fairly upon the palate, in preference to the stern, where the tumultuous sloshing of the water causes a wake, visible to a great distance. The palate D is sunk nearly as low as the keel, that it may not be influenced by the heaping up of the water and the dashing of the waves at and near the water line. The arch K is to ascertain how many knots or miles she would run in one hour at her then rate of sailing. But the graduations on this arch must be unequal; because the resistance of the spring L will increase as it becomes more bent, so that the index will travel over a greater space from one to five miles than from five to twelve. Lastly, The palate, rod, spring, and all the metallic parts of the instrument, should be covered with a strong varnish, to prevent rust from the corrosive quality of the salt water and sea air.\n\nThis machine may be considerably improved as follows: Let the rod or spear AB (fig. 5.) be a round rod of iron or steel, and instead of moving on the fulcrum or joint, as at C, let it pass through and turn freely in a socket, to which socket the moveable joint must be annexed, as represented in fig. 6. The rod must have a shoulder to bear on the upper edge of the socket, to prevent its slipping quite down. The rod must also pass through a like socket at F, fig. 5. The joint of the lower socket must be fixed to the bow of the ship, and the upper joint or socket must be connected with the horizontal arm E. On the top of the uppermost socket let there be a small circular plate, bearing the 32 points of the mariner's compass; and let the top of the rod AB come through the centre of this plate, so as to carry a small index upon it, as is represented in fig. 7. This small index must be fixed to the top of the rod on a square, so that by turning the index round the plate, the rod may also turn in the sockets, and of course carry the palate D round with it; the little index always pointing in a direction with the face of the palate. The small compass plate should not be fastened to the top of the socket, but only fitted tightly on, that it may be moveable at pleasure. Suppose then the intended port to bear S.W. from the place of departure, the palate must be turned on the socket till the south-west point thereon looks directly to the ship's bow; so that the south-west and north-east line on the compass plate may be precisely parallel with the ship's keel, and in this position the plate must remain during the whole voyage. Suppose, then, the ship to be sailing in the direct course of her intended voyage, with her bowprit pointing south-west. Let the little index be brought to the south-west point on the compass plate, and the palate D will necessarily present its broad face toward the port of destination; and this it must always be made to do, be the ship's course what it may. If, on account of unfavourable winds, the ship is obliged to deviate from her intended course, the little index must be moved so many points from the south-west line of the compass plate as the compass in the binnacle shall show that she deviates from her true course; so that in whatever direction the ship shall sail, the palate D will always look full to the south-west point of the horizon, or towards the port of destination, and consequently will present only an oblique surface to the resisting medium, more or less oblique as the ship deviates more or less from the true course of her voyage. As, therefore, the resistance of the water will operate less upon the palate in an oblique than in a direct position, in exact proportion to its obliquity, the index H will not show how many knots the vessel runs in her then course, but will indicate how many she gains in the direct line of her intended voyage.—Thus, in fig. 9. if the ship's course lies in the direction of the line AB, but she can sail by the wind no nearer than AC; suppose, then, her progressive motion such as to perform AC equal to five knots or miles in an hour, yet the index H will only point to four knots on the graduated arch, because she gains no more than at that rate on the true line of her voyage, viz. from A to B. Thus will the difference between her real motion and that pointed out by the index be always in proportion to her deviation from her intended port, until she fails in a line at right angles therewith, as AD; in which case the palate would present only a thin sharp edge to the resisting medium, the pressure of which should not be sufficient to overcome the friction of the machine and the bearing of the spring L. So that at whatever rate the ship may sail on that line, yet the index will not be affected, showing that she gains nothing on her true course. In this case, and also when the vessel is not under way, the action of the spring L should cause the index to point at O, as represented by the dotted lines in figs. 5. and 8.\n\nAs the truth of this instrument must depend on the equal pressure of the resisting medium upon the palate D, according to the ship's velocity, and the proportional action of the spring L, there should be a pin or screw at the joints C and F, so that the rod may be readily unshipped and taken in, in order to clean the palate from any foulness it may contract, which would greatly increase its operation on the index H, and thereby render the graduated arch false and uncertain.\n\nFurther, the spring L may be exposed too much to injury from the salt water, if fixed on the outside of the ship's bow. To remedy this, it may be brought under cover, by constructing the machine as represented by fig. 8. where AB is the rod, C the fulcrum or centre of Fig. 8.\nof its motion, D the palate, E the horizontal arm leading through a small hole into the forecastle; M is a strong chain fastened at one end to the arm E, and at the other to a rim or barrel on the wheel G, which by means of its teeth gives motion to the semicircle I and index H. The spring L is spiral, and enclosed in a box or barrel, like the main-spring of a watch. A small chain is fixed to, and passing round the barrel, is fastened by the other end to the fusee W. This fusee is connected by its teeth with the wheel G, and counteracts the motion of the palate D. N, N, are the two sockets through which the rod AB passes, and in which it is turned round by means of the little index R. S is the small compass plate, moveable on the top of the upper socket N. The plate S hath an upright rim round its edge, cut into teeth or notches, so that when the index R is a little raised up, in order to bring it round to any intended point, it may fall into one of these notches, and be detained there; otherwise the pressure of the water will force the palate D from its oblique position, and turn the rod and index round to the direction in which the ship shall be then failing.\n\nShould it be apprehended that the palate D, being placed too far forward, may affect the ship's steerage, or obstruct her rate of failing, it should be considered that a very small plate will be sufficient to work the machine, as one of three or four inches in diameter would probably be sufficient, and yet not large enough to have any sensible effect on the helm or ship's way.\n\nThe greatest difficulty, perhaps, will be in graduating the arch K, (if the machine is constructed as in fig. 5.) the unequal divisions of which can only be ascertained by actual experiment on board of each ship respectively, inasmuch as the accuracy of these graduations will depend on three circumstances, viz. the position of the fulcrum C with respect to the length of the rod, the size of the palate D, and the strength or bearing of the spring L. When these graduations, however, are once ascertained for the machine on board of any one vessel, they will not want any future alterations, provided the palate D be kept clean, and the spring L retains its elasticity.\n\nBut the unequal divisions of the graduated arch will be unnecessary, if the machine is constructed as in fig. 8; for as the chain goes round the barrel L, and then winds through the spiral channel of the fusee W, the force of the main spring must operate equally, or nearly so, in all positions of the index, and consequently the divisions of the arch K may in such case be equal.\n\nAfter all, it is not expected that a ship's longitude can be determined to a mathematical certainty by this instrument. The irregular motions and impulses to which a ship is continually exposed, make such an accuracy unattainable, perhaps by any machinery: But if it should be found, as we flatter ourselves it will on fair experiment, that it answers the purpose much better than the common log, it may be considered as an acquisition to the art of navigation.\n\nIt should be observed, that in ascertaining a ship's longitude by a time-piece, this great inconvenience occurs, that a small and trifling mistake in the time makes a very great and dangerous error in the distance run: Whereas the errors of this machine will operate no farther than their real amount; which can never be great or dangerous, if corrected by the usual observations made by mariners for correcting the common log.\n\nA like machine, made in its simple form (as at fig. 5.), so constructed as to ship and unship, might occasionally be applied alongside about midships, in order to ascertain the leeway; which, if rightly thrown, will give the ship's precise longitude. As to sea currents, this and all other machines hitherto invented must be subject to their influence; and proper allowances must be made according to the skill and knowledge of the navigator.\n\nLastly, Some discretion will be necessary in taking observations from the machine to be entered on the log-book: that is, the most favourable and equitable moment should be chosen for the observation; not whilst the ship is rapidly descending, the declivity of a wave, or is suddenly checked by a stroke of the sea, or is in the very act of plunging. In all cases, periods may be found in which a ship proceeds with a true average velocity; to discover which, a little experience and attention will lead the skilful mariner.\n\nIt has been observed of the machine now described, that an ingenious mechanic would probably contrive it to better advantage in many respects. The author only meant to suggest the principle; experiment alone can point out the best method of applying it. He is sensible of at least one deficiency, viz. that the little index R, fig. 4, will not be strong enough to retain the palate D in an oblique position when the ship is failing by the wind; more especially as the compass plate S, in whose notched rim the index R is to fall, is not fixed to, but only fitted tight on the socket N. Many means, however, might be contrived to remedy this inconvenience.\n\nSHIPWRECK. A French author has lately proposed some methods of saving the lives of persons shipwrecked near the coast. He observes, that the most proper means for saving the crews of shipwrecked vessels is, to establish a rope of communication from them to the shore. To a bomb or cannon ball should be fastened the end of a rope, extended afterwards in a zig-zag direction before the mortar or cannon, or suspended on a piece of wood raised several feet. But as it was necessary to know if the cord would not break by the force of the explosion and the velocity of the motion, the author thought it proper to consult professional men. He accordingly wrote to some officers of the artillery in garrison at La Fere in France, and they almost all replied that the rope would infallibly break.\n\nNot deeming this answer satisfactory, he happily conceived the idea of making the experiment on a small scale. He caused a piece of the barrel of a musket to be filed into the form of a small mortar of 18 lines in length internally; and having tied a packthread to a common ball of lead, he made an experiment which perfectly succeeded, as did many others which he afterwards repeated, even with the strongest charges of powder. This success he communicated to the officers of artillery, who replied, that there was a great difference between a quarter of an ounce of powder and four or five pounds employed for a bomb; and were still of opinion that the rope would break.\n\nHaving already made experiments, he was still disposed to doubt the truth of this assertion, and therefore tried a four-inch mortar with a ball of the same calibre, and 18 ounces of powder, with a rope only three or four\nfour lines in diameter, and his success was equally flattering as before. These experiments were repeated by order of government at La Fere, four times with an eight-inch mortar, and three times with one of twelve inches, all of which happily succeeded. The same author goes on to observe:\n\n\"It ought to be remembered, that a vessel is never cast away, or perishes on the coast, but because it is driven thither against the will of the captain, and by the violence of the waves and the wind, which almost always blows from the sea towards the shore, without which there would be no danger to be apprehended: consequently in these circumstances, the wind comes always from the sea, either directly or obliquely, and blows towards the shore.\n\n\"1st, A common paper kite, therefore, launched from the vessel and driven by the wind to the shore, would be sufficient to save a crew of 1500 seamen, if such were the number of a ship of war. This kite would convey to the shore a strong packthread, to the end of which might be affixed a cord, to be drawn on board by means of the string of the kite; and with this cord a rope, or as many as should be necessary, might be conveyed to the ship.\n\n\"2d, A small balloon, of six or seven feet in diameter, and raised by rarefied air, would be also an excellent means for the like purpose. Being driven by the wind from the vessel to the shore, it would carry thither a string capable of drawing a cord with which several ropes might be afterwards conveyed to the vessel. Had not the discovery of Montgolfier produced any other benefit, it would be entitled on this account to be considered as of great importance.\n\n\"3dly, A sky rocket, of a large diameter, would be of equal service. It would also carry, from the vessel to the shore, a string capable of drawing a rope after it.\n\n\"Lastly, A fourth plan for saving the crew of a shipwrecked vessel, is that of throwing from the vessel into the sea an empty cask with a cord attached to it. The wind and the waves would drive the cask to the shore, and afford the means of establishing that rope of communication already mentioned.\"\n\nThe author just quoted says, that he announced his discovery in a French journal in January 1794. It is, however, to be observed, that the method he proposes of conveying a rope to the shore, by fastening it to a bullet or bomb, to be afterwards fired from a cannon or mortar, was proposed some years ago by a sergeant or officer of artillery at Woolwich, and it is said, similar experiments were made at Portsmouth, and succeeded.*\n\nSHIRAUZ. See SCHIRAS.\n\nSHIRE, is a Saxon word signifying a division; but a county, comitatus, of the same import, is plainly derived from comer, \"the count of the Franks;\" that is, the earl or alderman (as the Saxons called him) of the shire, to whom the government of it was entrusted. This he usually exercised by his deputy, still called in Latin vice-comer, and in English the sheriff, shrieve, or shire-reeve, signifying the \"officer of the shire,\" upon whom, in process of time, the civil administration of it totally devolved. In some counties there is an intermediate division between the shire and the hundred; as lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex, each of them containing about three or four hundred a-piece. These had formerly their lathe-reeves and rape-reeves, acting in subordination to the shire-reeve. Where a county is divided into three of these intermediate jurisdictions, they are called trithings, which were anciently governed by a trithing reeve. These trithings fill subhut in the large county of York, where, by an easy corruption, they are denominated ridings; the north, the east, and the west ridings.\n\nSHIRL, SHORL, or COCKLE, a species of mineral. See MINERALOGY Index.\n\nSHIRT, a loose garment, commonly of linen, worn next the body.—Some doubt the propriety of changing the linen when a person is sick. Clean linen promotes perspiration; and it may be renewed as often as the patient pleases, whether the disorder be of the acute or the chronic kind. Except during a crisis in fevers, whilst the patient is in a sweat, a change of linen, if well dried and warmed, may be daily used.\n\nShirts were not worn by the Jews, Greeks, or Romans, but their place was supplied by thin tunics of wool. The want of linen among the ancients made frequent washings and ablutions necessary.\n\nSHIVER, a name given by miners to some of the strata which accompany coal. See SCHISTUS, MINERALOGY Index.\n\nSHIVERS, in the sea language, names given to the little rollers, or round wheels of pulleys.\n\nSHOAD, among miners, denotes a train of metallic stones, serving to direct them in the discovery of mines.\n\nSHOAD-Stones, a term used by the miners of Cornwall and other parts of this kingdom, to express such loose masses of stone as are usually found about the entrances into mines, sometimes running in a straight course from the load or vein of ore to the surface of the earth.\n\nThese are stones of the common kinds, appearing to have been pieces broken from the strata or larger masses; but they usually contain mastic, or marcasite matter, and more or less of the ore to be found in the mine. They appear to have been at some time rolled about in water, their corners being broken off, and their surface smoothed and rounded.\n\nThe antimony mines in Cornwall are always easily discovered by the flood-stones, these usually lying up to the surface, or very nearly so; and the matter of the stone being a white spar, or debated crystal, in which the native colour of the ore, which is a shining bluish black, easily discovers itself in streaks and threads.\n\nShoad-stones are of so many kinds, and of such various appearances, that it is not easy to describe or know them; but the miners, to whom they are of the greatest use in the tracing or searching after new mines, distinguish them from other stones by their weight; for if very ponderous, though they look ever so much like common stones, there is great reason to suspect that they contain some metal. Another mark of them is their being spongy and porous; this is a sign of especial use in the tin countries; for the tin shoad-stones are often so porous and spongy, that they resemble large bodies thoroughly calcined. There are many other appearances of tin shoads, the very hardest and firmest stones often containing this metal.\n\nWhen the miners, in tracing a flood up hill, meet with such odd stones and earths that they know not what to make of them, they have recourse to vaning, that is, they calcine and powder the stone, clay, or whatever else is supposed to contain the metal; and then\nthen washing it in an instrument, prepared for that purpose, and called a vaning shovel, they find the earthy matter washed away, and of the remainder, the flaky or gravelly matter lies behind, and the metallic matter at the point of the shovel. If the person who performs this operation has any judgement, he easily discovers not only what the metal is that is contained in the shoad, but also will make a very probable guess at what quantity the mine is likely to yield of it in proportion to the ore.\n\nSHOAL, in the sea language, denotes a place where the water is shallow; and likewise a great quantity of fishes, such as a shoal of herrings.\n\nSHOCK, in Electricity. The effect of the explosion of a charged body, that is, the discharge of its electricity on any other body, is called the electric shock.\n\nSHOE, a covering for the foot, usually of leather.\n\nShoes, among the Jews, were made of leather, linen, ruff, or wood; those of soldiers were sometimes of braids or iron. They were tied with thongs which passed under the soles of the feet. To put off their shoes was an act of veneration; it was also a sign of mourning and humiliation: to bear one's shoes, or to untie the latches of them, was considered as the meanest service.\n\nAmong the Greeks shoes of various kinds were used. Sandals were worn by women of distinction. The Macedonians wore red shoes. The Grecian shoes generally reached to the middle of the leg. The Romans used two kinds of shoes; the calceus, which covered the whole foot somewhat like our shoes, and was tied above with latches or strings; and the flosa or flipper, which covered only the sole of the foot, and was fastened with leathern thongs. The calceus was always worn along with the toga when a person went abroad; flippers were put on during a journey and at feasts, but it was reckoned effeminate to appear in public with them. Black shoes were worn by the citizens of ordinary rank, and white ones by the women. Red shoes were sometimes worn by the ladies, and purple ones by the coxcombs of the other sex. Red shoes were put on by the chief magistrates of Rome on days of ceremony and triumphs. The shoes of senators, patricians, and their children, had a crescent upon them which served for a buckle; these were called calcei lunati. Slaves wore no shoes; hence they were called cretati from their dusty feet. Phocion also and Cato Uticensis went without shoes. The toes of the Roman shoes were turned up in the point; hence they were called calcei rostrati, repandi, &c.\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries the greatest princes of Europe wore wooden shoes, or the upper part of leather and the sole of wood. In the reign of William Rufus, a great beau, Robert, surnamed the horned, used shoes with long sharp points, stuffed with tow, and twisted like a ram's horn. It is said the clergy, being highly offended, declaimed against the long-pointed shoes with great vehemence. The points, however, continued to increase till, in the reign of Richard II., they were of so enormous a length that they were tied to the knees with chains, sometimes of gold, sometimes of silver. The upper parts of these shoes in Chaucer's time were cut in imitation of a church window. The long-pointed shoes were called crackowers, and continued in fashion for three centuries in spite of the bulls of popes, the decrees of councils, and the declarations of the clergy. At length the parliament of England interposed by an act A.D. 1463, prohibiting the use of shoes or boots with pikes exceeding two inches in length, and prohibiting all shoemakers from making shoes or boots with longer pikes under severe penalties. But even this was not sufficient: it was necessary to denounce the dreadful sentence of excommunication against all who wore shoes or boots with points longer than two inches. The present fashion of shoes was introduced in 1633, but the buckle was not used till 1670.\n\nIn Norway they use shoes of a particular construction, consisting of two pieces, and without heels; in which the upper leather fits close to the foot, the sole being joined to it by many plaited folds.\n\nThe shoes or slippers of the Japanese, as we are informed by Professor Thunberg, are made of rice-straw woven, but sometimes for people of distinction of fine slips of rattan. The shoe consists of a sole, without upper leather or hind-piece; forwards it is crossed by a strap, of the thickness of one's finger, which is lined with linen; from the tip of the shoe to the strap a cylindrical string is carried, which passes between the great and second toe, and keeps the shoe fast on the foot. As these shoes have no hind-piece, they make a noise when people walk in them like flippers. When the Japanese travel, their shoes are furnished with three strings made of twisted straw, with which they are tied to the legs and feet, to prevent them from falling off. Some people carry one or more pairs of shoes with them on their journeys, in order to put on new, when the old ones are worn out. When it rains, or the roads are very dirty, these shoes are soon wetted through, and one continually sees a great number of worn-out shoes lying on the roads, especially near the brooks, where travelers have changed their shoes after washing their feet. Instead of these, in rainy or dirty weather they wear high wooden clogs, which underneath are hollowed out in the middle, and at top have a band across like a stirrup, and a string for the great toe; so that they can walk without foiling their feet. Some of them have their straw shoes fastened to these wooden clogs. The Japanese never enter their houses with their shoes on; but leave them in the entry, or place them on the bench near the door, and thus are always barefooted in their houses, so as not to dirty their neat mats. During the time that the Dutch live at Japan, when they are sometimes under an obligation of paying visits at the houses of the Japanese, their own rooms at the factory being likewise covered with mats of this kind, they wear, instead of the usual shoes, red, green, or black slippers, which, on entering the house they pull off; however, they have stockings on, and shoes made of cotton stuff with buckles in them, which shoes are made at Japan, and can be washed whenever they are dirty. Some have them of black satin, in order to avoid washing them.\n\nSHOE of an Anchor, a small block of wood, convex on the back, and having a small hole, sufficient to contain the point of the anchor fluke, on the foreside. It is used to prevent the anchor from tearing or wounding the planks on the ship's bow, when ascending or descending; for which purpose the shoe slides up and down along the bow between the fluke of the anchor and the planks, as being pressed close to the latter by the weight of the former.\n\nTo SHOE an Anchor, is to cover the flukes with a broad\nbroad triangular piece of plank, whose area or surfaces is much larger than that of the flukes. It is intended to give the anchor a stronger and surer hold of the bottom in very soft and oozy ground.\n\nSHOEMAKERS MACHINE for working at in a standing posture. A machine for this purpose was invented by Mr Thomas Parker, who, on the 22d of November, 1834, attended a committee appointed by the Society of Arts, and informed them that he had made use of this apparatus for twelve months, and found it very useful. He observed that all the work of shoe-making may be done with it standing; but that in some parts thereof he found an advantage in using along with it a high stool; and that prior to the use of this machine, he never saw or heard of a similar invention; and that he found it of great service to his health.\n\nHe estimated the cost of such a machine at two guineas.\n\nPlate CCCCXCVI. fig. 1, T, a bench standing on four legs, about four feet from the ground.\n\nV, A circular cushion affixed to the bench, in the centre of which cushion is an open space quite through the bench, through which hole a leather strap U is brought up from below. This strap holds the work and last firm upon the cushion in any position required, by means of the workman's foot placed upon the treadle W.\n\nX, Shews the last upon the cushion, with the strap holding it firm.\n\nY, An implement used in closing boots.\n\nZ, A small flat leather cushion, useful in adjusting the last and strap.\n\nL, The shoe-last shewn separate from the cushion. The round cushion is formed of a circular piece of wood, covered with leather or stuffed with wool or hair to give it some elasticity.\n\nAnother machine for the same purpose has been invented by Mr Holden of Fettleworth in Suffolk, and the following account of it was presented to the Society of Arts. He observes that the fitting posture had so greatly injured his health, as to render it necessary to give up his business, and in this difficulty he invented the machine which he found to answer the purpose fully, as it enabled him to resume his work with the recovery of his health. He recommends it as the quickest way of closing all the thread work, and he adds, that he has made 1500 or 2000 pairs of shoes with the machine, and still continues to employ it. The following is a description of the machine.\n\nFig. 2.

This half circle moves in the block G.\n\nH, Another iron semi-circle, with notches, which catch upon a tooth in the centre of the block, to hold the bed in any angle required.

See FARRIERY, No. 131.\n\nSHOOTING, in the military art. See ARTILLERY, GUNNERY, and PROJECTILES.\n\nSHOOTING, in sportsmanship, the killing of game by shooting in the gun, with or without the help of dogs.\n\nUnder this article we shall lay down all the rules which are necessary to be observed in order to render one accomplished and successful in the art of shooting.\n\nThe first thing which the sportsman ought to attend to is the choice of his fowling-piece. Convenience requires that the barrel be as light as possible, at the same time it ought to possess that degree of strength which will make it not liable to burst. Experience has proved, that a thin and light barrel, which is of equal thickness in every part of its circumference, is much less liable to burst than one which is considerably thicker and heavier, but which, from being badly filed or bored, is of unequal strength in different places.\n\nIt is also of importance to determine of what length the barrel ought to be, in order to acquire that range which the sportsman has occasion for. On this subject we have received the following information from an experienced sportsman. We have, at different times, compared barrels of all the intermediate lengths between 28 and 40 inches, and of nearly the same caliber, that is to say, from 22 to 26; and these trials were made both by firing the pieces from the shoulder, and from a firm block, at an equal distance, and with equal weights of the same powder and of the same shot.\n\nTo avoid every possibility of error, the queries of paper at which we fired were fixed against planks instead of being placed against the wall. From these trials frequently repeated, we found that the shot pierced an equal number of sheets, whether it was fired from a barrel of 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, or 40, inches in length. Nay more, we have compared two barrels of the same caliber, but one of them 33, and the other 66 inches long, by repeatedly firing them in the same manner as the others, at different distances, from 45 to 100 paces, and the results have always been the same, i.e., the barrel of 33 inches drove its shot through as many sheets of paper as that of 66 did. The conclusion from all this is, that the difference of 10 inches in the length of the barrel, which seems to be more than is ever inflicted upon among sportsmen, produces no sensible difference in the range of the piece; and therefore, that every one may please himself in the length of his barrel, without either detriment or advantage to the range.\n\nIt may appear as an objection to this, that a duck-gun which is five or six feet long kills at a greater distance than\nShooting than a fowling-piece; but this is not owing to its length, but to its greater weight and thickness, which give it such additional strength, that the shot may be increased, and the charge of powder doubled, trebled, and even quadrupled. But a barrel of five or six feet length would be very inconvenient for fowling. Those who consult the appearance of the piece, lightness, and the ease with which it is managed, will find that a barrel from 32 to 38 inches will answer best.\n\nThe next thing to be considered is, of what dimensions the caliber or bore of a fowling-piece ought to be. This matter has been subjected to experiment, and it has been found, that a barrel of 22 or 24, which is the largest caliber usually employed in fowling-pieces, throws its shot as closely as one of the smallest caliber, viz. of 30 or 32 (A).\n\nAs to the length and form of the stock, it may be laid down as a principle, that a long stock is preferable to a short one, and at the same time rather more bent than usual; for a long stock fits firmer to the shoulder than a short one, and particularly so when the shooter is accustomed to place his left hand, which principally supports the piece, near to the entrance of the ramrod into the stock.\n\nIt is certain, however, that the stock may be so formed as to be better suited to one man than another. For a tall, long-armed man, the stock of a gun should be longer than for one of a less stature and shorter arm. That a straight stock is proper for him who has high shoulders and a short neck; for, if it be much bent, it would be very difficult for him, especially in the quick motion required in shooting at a flying or running object, to place the butt of the gun-stock firmly to the shoulder, the upper part alone would in general be fixed; which would not only raise the muzzle, and consequently float high, but make the recoil much more sensibly felt, than if the whole end of the stock were firmly placed on his shoulder. Besides, supposing the shooter to bring the butt home to his shoulder, he would scarcely be able to level his piece at the object. On the contrary, a man with low shoulders, and a long neck, requires a stock much bent; for if it is straight, he will, in the act of lowering his head to that place of the stock at which his cheek should rest in taking aim, feel a constraint which he never experiences, when by the effect of the proper degree of bent, the stock lends him some assistance, and, as it were, meets his aim halfway.\n\nHaving now described the fowling-piece which has been found to answer best, it will next be proper to give some instructions for the choice of gunpowder, shot, and wadding.\n\nThe various kinds of gunpowder are well known; but, in the opinion of some experienced sportsman, Harvey's battle-powder is the best. Those who wish to examine the strength of powder, may determine it by drying some of it very well, and then trying how many sheets of paper it will drive the shot through, at the distance of 10 or 12 yards. In this trial we should be careful to employ the same sized shot in each experiment, the quantity both of the shot and the powder being regulated by exact weight; otherwise we cannot, even in this experiment, arrive at any certainty in comparing the strength of different powders, or of the same powder at different times.\n\nPowder ought to be kept very dry, for every degree of moisture injures it; and if considerable, the saltpetre is dissolved, and the intimate combination of the several ingredients is entirely destroyed. It is observed, that after firing with damp powder the piece becomes very foul, which seems to arise from the diminution of the activity of the fire in the explosion. Flasks of copper or tin are much better for keeping powder than those made of leather, or than small casks. Their necks ought to be small and well stoppered with cork.\n\nThe patent milled shot is now very generally used, and is reckoned superior to any other. The size of the shot must vary according to the particular species of game which is the object of the sportsman's pursuit, as well as be adapted to the season. In the first month of partridge shooting, No. 1, is most proper; for since at this time the birds spring near at hand, and we seldom fire at more than the distance of 40 paces, if the shooter takes his aim but tolerably well, it is almost impossible for a bird at this distance to escape in the circle which the shot forms.\n\nAs hares sit closer, and are thinly covered with fur at this season, they may easily be killed with this shot at 30 or 35 paces. No. 1 is equally proper for shooting hares or quails. About the beginning of October, when the partridges are stronger, No. 3 is the most proper shot to be used. Many sportsmen use no other during the whole season. The directions which have now been given refer only to the patent shot.\n\nWe shall now subjoin a table, which will show at once the number of pellets composing an ounce weight of each sort of shot, the patent and the common, beginning with the smallest size.\n\n| Patent Shot | Common Shot |\n|-------------|-------------|\n| No. 8       | 1 ounce     | 625         |\n|             | id.         | 480         |\n| X (8) id.   |             | 300         |\n| 1           | ib          | 220         |\n| 2           | id          | 180         |\n| 3           | id          | 157         |\n| 4           | id          | 105         |\n| 5           | id          | 83          |\n| No. 7       | 1 ounce     | 350         |\n| 6           | id          | 260         |\n| 5           | id          | 235         |\n| 4           | id          | 190         |\n| 3           | id          | 140         |\n| 2           | id          | 110         |\n| 1           | id          | 95          |\n\nFor a fowling-piece of a common caliber, which is proportioned from 24 to 30 balls to the pound weight, a dram and a quarter, the charge...\n\n(A) In speaking of the size of the caliber, we mean by 22 or 24, that so many balls exactly fitting it weigh just one pound; and every caliber is marked in the same way.\n\n(B) The reader will observe that the patent shot has no No. 6, the X being substituted in its place, and that the numbers do not follow each other in the order of progression: The reason of this we cannot assign.\nShooting quarter, or at most a dram and a half, of good powder; and an ounce, or an ounce and a quarter of shot, is sufficient. But when shot of a larger size is used, such as No. 5, the charge of shot may be increased one-fourth, for the purpose of counterbalancing in some degree what the size of the shot loses in the number of pellets, and also to enable it to garnish the more. For this purpose the sportsman will find a measure marked with the proper gauges very convenient to him. An instrument of this nature has been made by an ingenious artist of London, Egg, of the Haymarket.\n\nA consequence of overloading with shot, is the powder has not sufficient strength to throw it to its proper distance; for if the object fired at be distant, one-half of the pellets composing the charge, by their too great quantity and weight, will strike against each other, and fall by the way; and those which reach the mark will have small force, and will produce but little or no effect.\n\nThe use of the wadding is to carry the shot in a body to a certain distance from the muzzle of the piece. It ought to be of soft and pliable materials. The best kind of wadding, in the opinion of an experienced fowler, is a piece of an old hat; but this cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity. Next to it nothing is better than soft brown paper, which combines suppleness with consistence, moulds itself to the barrel, and never falls to the ground within 12 or 15 paces from the muzzle of the piece. Tow answers very well, and cork has been extolled for possessing the peculiar virtue of increasing the range and closeness of the shot.\n\nThe wadding ought to be quite close in the barrel, but not rammed too hard; for if it be rammed too close, or be of a rigid substance, the piece will recoil, and the shot will spread too much. On the other hand, if the wadding be very loose, or is composed of too soft materials, such as wool or cotton, the discharge will not possess proper force.\n\nIn loading a piece, the powder ought to be slightly rammed down by only pressing the ramrod two or three times on the wadding, and not by drawing up the ramrod and then returning it into the barrel with a jerk of the arm several times. For when the powder is violently compressed, some of the grains must be bruised, which will prevent the explosion from being quick, and will spread the shot too wide. In pouring the powder into the barrel, the measure ought to be held so as that the powder may fall most readily to the bottom. That no grains may adhere to the sides of the barrel, the butt-end of the piece may be struck against the ground. The shot ought never to be rammed down with force; it is sufficient to strike the butt-end of the gun against the ground as before. Then the wadding is to be put down gently. A sportsman ought never to carry his gun under his arm with the muzzle inclined downwards, for this practice loosens the wadding and charge too much.\n\nImmediately after the piece is fired it ought to be reloaded; for while the barrel is still warm, there is no danger of any moisture lodging in it to hinder the powder from falling to the bottom. As it is found that the coldness of the barrel, and perhaps the moisture condensed in it, diminishes the force of the powder in the first shot; it is proper to fire off a little powder before the piece is loaded. Some prime before loading, but this is not proper unless the touch-hole be very large. After every discharge the touch-hole ought to be pricked, or a small feather may be inserted to clear away any humidity or foulness that has been contracted.\n\nThe sportsman having loaded his piece, must next prepare to fire. For this purpose he ought to place his hand near the entrance of the ramrod, and at the same time grasp the barrel firmly. The muzzle should be a little elevated, for it is more usual to shoot low than high. This direction ought particularly to be attended to when the object is a little distant; because shot as well as ball only moves a certain distance point blank, when it begins to describe the curve of the parabola.\n\nPractice soon teaches the sportsman the proper distance at which he should shoot. The distance at which he ought infallibly to kill any kind of game with patent shot, No. 3, provided the aim be well taken, is from 25 to 35 paces for the footed, and from 40 to 45 paces for the winged game. Beyond this distance even to 50 or 55 paces, both partridges and hares are sometimes killed; but in general the hares are only slightly wounded, and carry away the shot; and the partridges at that distance present to small a surface, that they frequently escape untouched between the spaces of the circle. Yet it does not follow that a partridge may not be killed with No. 3, patent shot at 60 and even 70 paces distance, but then these shots are very rare.\n\nIn shooting at a bird flying, or a hare running across, how it is necessary to take aim before the object in proportion to its distance at the time of firing. If a partridge flies across at the distance of 30 or 35 paces, it will be sufficient to aim at the head, or at most but a small space before it. If it be 50, 60, or 70 paces distant, it is then requisite to aim at least half a foot before the head. The same practice ought to be observed in shooting at a hare, rabbit, or fox, when running in a cross direction; at the same time making due allowance for the distance and swiftness of the pace. Another thing to be attended to is, that the shooter ought not involuntarily to stop the motion of the arms at the moment of pulling the trigger; for the instant the hand stops in order to fire, however inconsiderable the time be, the bird gets beyond the line of aim, and the shot will miss it. A sportsman ought therefore to accustom his hand while he is taking aim to follow the object. When a hare runs in a straight line from the shooter, he should take his aim between the ears, otherwise he will run the hazard either of missing, or at least not of killing dead, or as it is sometimes called clean.\n\nA fowling-piece should not be fired more than 25 or every part 25 times without being washed; a barrel when foul needs of the piece ther shoots so ready, nor carries the shot so far as when to be kept clean. The flint, pan, and hammer, should be well clean and wiped after each shot; this contributes greatly to make the piece go off quick, but then it should be done with such expedition, that the barrel may be reloaded whilst warm, for the reasons we have before advanced. The flint should be frequently changed, without waiting until it misses fire, before a new one is put in. Fifteen or eighteen shots, therefore, should only be fired with the same flint; the expense is too trifling to be regarded, and by changing it thus often much vexation will be prevented.\nA gun also should never be fired with the prime of the preceding day; it may happen that an old priming will sometimes go off well, but it will more frequently contract moisture and fuse in the firing; then the object will most probably be missed, and that because the piece was not fresh primed.\n\nFor the information of the young sportsman we shall add a few more general directions. In warm weather he ought to seek for game in plains and open grounds, and in cold weather he may search little hills exposed to the sun, along hedges, among heath, in stubbles, and in pastures where there is much furze and fern. The morning is the best time of the day, before the dew is exhaled, and before the game has been disturbed. The colours of the shooters dress ought to be the same with that of the fields and trees; in summer it ought to be green, in winter a dark gray. He ought to hunt as much as possible with the wind, not only to prevent the game from perceiving the approach of him and his dog, but also to enable the dog to scent the game at a greater distance.\n\nHe should never be discouraged from hunting and ranging the same ground over and over again, especially in places covered with heath, brambles, high grass, or young coppice wood. A hare or rabbit will frequently suffer him to pass several times within a few yards of its form without getting up. He should be still more patient when he has marked partridges into such places, for it often happens, that after the birds have been sprung many times, they lie so dead that they will suffer him almost to tread upon them before they will rise. Pheasants, quails, and woodcocks do the same.\n\nHe ought to look carefully about him, never passing a bush or tuft of grass without examination; but he ought never to strike them with the muzzle of his gun for it will loosen his wadding. He who patiently beats and ranges his ground over again, without being discouraged, will always kill the greatest quantity of game; and if he is shooting in company, he will find game where others have passed without discovering any.\n\nWhen he has fired he should call in his dog, that he may not have the mortification to see game rise which he cannot shoot. When he has killed a bird, instead of being anxious about picking it up, he ought to follow the rest of the covey with his eye till he see them settle.\n\nThree species of dogs are capable of receiving the proper instruction, and of being trained. These are the smooth pointer, the spaniel, and the rough pointer. The last is a dog with long curled hair, and seems to be a mixed breed of the water-dog and the spaniel. The smooth pointer is active and lively enough in his range, but in general is proper only for an open country.\n\nThe greatest part of these dogs are afraid of water, brambles, and thickets; but the spaniel and the rough pointer are easily taught to take the water, even in cold weather, and to range the woods and rough places as well as the plain. Greater dependence may therefore be had on these two last species of dogs than on the smooth pointer.\n\nThe education of a pointer may commence when he is only five or six months old. The only lessons which he can be taught at this time are to fetch and carry any thing when desired; to come in when he runs far off, shooting, and to go behind when he returns; using, in the one case, the words here, come in, and in the other back or behind. It is also necessary at this period to accustom him to be tied up in the kennel or stable; but he ought not at first to be tied too long. He should be let loose in the morning, and fastened again in the evening. When a dog is not early accustomed to be chained, he disturbs every person in the neighbourhood by howling. It is also of importance that the person who is to train him should give him his food.\n\nWhen the dog has attained the age of 10 or 12 months, he may be carried into the field to be regularly trained. At first he may be allowed to follow his own inclination, and to run after every animal he sees. His indiscriminating eagerness will soon abate, and he will pursue only partridges and hares. He will soon become tired of following partridges in vain, and will content himself after having flushed them to follow them with his eyes. It will be more difficult to prevent him from following hares.\n\nAll young dogs are apt to rake; that is, to hunt with their noses close to the ground, to follow birds rather by the track than by the wind. But partridges lie much better to dogs that wind them, than to those that follow them by the track. The dog that winds the scent approaches the birds by degrees and without disturbing them; but they are immediately alarmed when they see a dog tracing their footsteps. When you perceive that your dog is committing this fault, call to him in an angry tone hold up: he will then grow uneasy and agitated, going first to the one side and then to the other, until the wind brings him the scent of the birds. After finding the game four or five times in this way, he will take the wind of himself, and hunt with his nose high. If it be difficult to correct this fault, it will be necessary to put the puzzle peg upon him. This is of very simple construction, consisting only of a piece of oak or deal inch board, one foot in length, and an inch and a half in breadth, tapering a little to one end; at the broader end are two holes running longitudinally, through which the collar of the dog is put, and the whole is buckled round his neck; the piece of wood being projected beyond his nose, is then fastened with a piece of leather thong to his under jaw. By this means the peg advancing seven or eight inches beyond his snout, the dog is prevented from putting his nose to the ground and raking.\n\nAs soon as the young dog knows his game, you must bring him under complete subjection. If he is tractable, this will be easy; but if he is stubborn, it will be necessary to use the ira/b cord, which is a rope or cord of 20 or 25 fathoms in length fastened to his collar. If he refuse to come back when called upon, you must check him smartly with the cord, which will often bring him upon his haunches. But be sure you never call to him except when you are within reach of the cord. After repeating this several times he will not fail to come back when called; he ought then to be careful, and a bit of bread should be given him. He ought now constantly to be tied up, and never unchained, except when you give him his food, and even then only when he has done something to deserve it.\n\nThe next step will be to throw down a piece of bread on the ground, at the same moment taking hold of...\nShooting, \"of the dog by the collar, calling out to him, 'take heed,—softly.'\" After having held him in this manner for some space of time, say to him, \"seize—lay hold.\" If he is impatient to lay hold of the piece of bread before the signal is given, correct him gently with a small whip. Repeat this lesson until he \"takes heed\" well, and no longer requires to be held fast to prevent him from laying hold of the bread. When he is well accustomed to this manœuvre, turn the bread with a stick, holding it in the manner you do a fowling-piece, and having done so, cry \"seize.\" Never suffer the dog to eat either in the house or field without having first made him take heed in this manner.\n\nThen, in order to apply this lesson to the game, fry small pieces of bread in hogs lard, with the dung of partridge; take these in a linen bag into the fields, stubbles, ploughed grounds, and pastures, and there put the pieces in several different places, marking the spots with little cleft pickets of wood, which will be rendered more distinguishable by putting pieces of card in the nicks. This being done, cast off the dog and conduct him to these places, always hunting in the wind. After he has caught the scent of the bread, if he approaches too near, and seems eager to fall upon it, cry to him in a menacing tone, \"take heed!\" and if he does not stop immediately, correct him with the whip. He will soon comprehend what is required of him, and will stand.\n\nAt the next lesson, take your gun charged only with powder, walk gently round the piece of bread once or twice, and fire instead of crying \"seize.\" The next time of practising this lesson, walk round the bread four or five times, but in a greater circle than before, and continue to do this, until the dog is conquered of his impatience, and will stand without moving until the signal is given him. When he keeps his point well, and stands steady in this lesson, you may carry him to the birds; if he run in upon them, or bark when they spring up, you must correct him; and if he continue to do so, you must return to the fried bread; but this is seldom necessary.\n\nWhen the dog has learned by this use of the bread to take heed, he may be carried to the fields with the trash-cord dragging on the ground. When he springs birds for the first time, if he runs after them or barks, check him by calling out to him, \"take heed.\" If he point properly, caress him; but you ought never to hunt without the cord until he point staunch.\n\nIf the dog runs after sheep, and it be difficult to cure him, couple him with a ram, and then whip the dog as long as you can follow him. His cries will at first alarm the ram; he will run with all his speed, and drag the dog along with him; but he will at length take courage, turn upon the dog, and butt him severely with his horns. When you think the dog is sufficiently chastified, untie him: he will never run at sheep again.\n\nHaving now given a few general instructions concerning the best method of training pointers, we shall subjoin a few observations respecting the most common species of game, the partridge, pheasant, grouse, woodcock, snipe, and wild duck.\n\nPartridges pair in the spring, and lay their eggs (generally from 15 to 20) during May and part of June. The young begin to fly about the end of June, and their plumage is complete in the beginning of October. The male has a conspicuous horse shoe upon his breast, an obtuse spur on the hinder part of the leg, which distinguishes him from the female. He is also rather larger.\n\nWhen a sportsman is shooting in a country where the birds are thin, and he no longer chooses to range the field for the bare chance of meeting with them, the following method will show him where to find them on another day. In the evening, from sunset to nightfall, he should post himself in a field, at the foot of a tree or a bush, and there wait until the partridges begin to call or juck, which they always do at that time; not only for the purpose of drawing together when separated, but also when the birds composing the covey are not dispersed. After calling in this manner for some little space of time, the partridges will take to flight; then, if he mark the place where they alight, he may assuredly they will lie there the whole night, unless disturbed. Let him return to the same post the next morning by break of day, and there watch a while; being careful to keep his dog in a string, if he is not under perfect command.\n\nAs soon as the dawn begins to peep, the partridges will begin to call, and soon afterwards will perform the same manoeuvre as on the preceding evening; that is, after having called a while, they will take their flight, and will most commonly settle at a little distance. There in a few minutes they will call again, and sometimes take a second flight, but that will be to no great distance. Then as soon as the sun is risen, and the sportsman can see to shoot, he may cast off his dog and pursue them.\n\nThe pheasant is of the size of a common dunghill Pheasant cock, and lays its eggs generally in the woods, the number of which is 10 or 12.\n\nPheasants are accounted stupid birds; for when they are surprised they will frequently squat down like a rabbit, supposing themselves to be in safety as soon as their heads are concealed; and in this way they will sometimes suffer themselves to be killed with a stick. They love low and moist places, and haunt the edges of those pools which are found in woods, as well as the high grass of marshes that are near at hand; and above all, places where there are clumps of alders.\n\nGrouse, or moor-game, are found in Wales, in the Grouse northern counties of England, and in great abundance in Scotland. They chiefly inhabit those mountains and moors which are covered with heath, and seldom descend to the low grounds. They fly in companies of four or five brace, and love to frequent mossy places, particularly in the middle of the day or when the weather is warm. In pursuing this game, when the pointer rests, and the sportsman perceives the birds running with their heads erect, he must run after them as fast as he can, in the hope that he may get near enough to shoot when they rise upon the wing; for he may be pretty certain they will not lie well that day. As these birds are apt to grow soon putrid, they ought to be drawn carefully the instant they are shot and stuffed with any heath, and if the feathers happen to be wetted they must be wiped dry.\n\nThe woodcock is a bird of passage; it commonly arrives about the end of October, and remains until the middle of March. Woodcocks are fattest in December and January, but from the end of February they are lean. At their arrival they drop anywhere, but afterwards...\nwards take up their residence in copses of nine or ten years growth. They seldom, however, stay in one place longer than 12 or 15 days. During the day, they remain in those parts of the woods where there are void spaces or glades, picking up earthworms and grubs from the fallen leaves. In the evening they go to drink and wash their bills at pools and springs, after which they repair to the open fields and meadows for the night.\n\nIt is remarkable, that when a woodcock springs from a wood to go into the open country, he always endeavours to find some glade or opening, which he follows to the boundaries of the wood. At his return he pursues the same path a good way, and then turns to the right or left opposite to some glade, in order to drop into a thick part of the wood, where he may be sheltered from the wind. He may therefore be watched with advantage in these narrow passes and little alleys on the edges of woods which lead to a pool or spring, or he may be watched in the dusk of the evening near the pools which he frequents.\n\nThe snipe is a bird of passage as well as the woodcock. This bird is scarcely worth shooting till the frosts commence. In the month of November they begin to grow fat. Snipes, like woodcocks, frequent springs, bogs, and marshy places, and generally fly against the wind. The flint and crosb shots are rather difficult, as the birds are small and fly very quickly. The sportsman ought to look for them in the direction of the wind; because then they will fly towards him, and present a fairer mark.\n\nThe wild duck is also a bird of passage, and arrives here in great flocks from the northern countries in the beginning of winter. Still, however, a great many remain in our marshes and fens during the whole year, and breed.\n\nThe wild duck differs little in plumage from the tame duck, but is easily distinguished by its size, which is less; by the neck, which is more slender; by the foot, which is smaller; by the nails, which are more black; and above all, by the web of the foot, which is much finer and softer to the touch.\n\nIn the summer season, when it is known that a team of young ducks are in a particular piece of water, and just beginning to fly, the sportsman is sure to find them early in the morning dabbling at the edges of the pool, and amongst the long grass, and then he may get very near to them: it is usual also to find them in those places at noon.\n\nIn the beginning of autumn almost every pool is frequented by teams of wild ducks, which remain there during the day, concealed in the rushes. If these pools are of small extent, two shooters, by going one on each side, making a noise and throwing stones into the rushes, will make them fly up; and they will in this way frequently get shots, especially if the pool is not broad, and contracts at one end. But the surest and most successful way, is to launch a small boat or barge on the pool, and to traverse the rushes by the openings which are found; at the same time making as little noise as possible. In this manner the ducks will suffer the sportsmen to come sufficiently near them to shoot flying; and it often happens that the ducks, after having flown up, only make a circuit, return in a little time, and again alight upon the pool. Then the sportsmen endeavour a second time to come near them. If several shooters are in company, they should divide; two should go in the boat, whilst the others spread themselves about the edge of the pool, in order to shoot the ducks in their flight. In pools which will not admit a barge, waterpannels are absolutely necessary for this sport.\n\nIn winter they may be found on the margins of little pools; and when pools and rivers are frozen up, they must be watched for in places where there are springs and waters which do not freeze. The sport is then much more certain, because the ducks are confined to these places in order to procure aquatic herbs, which are almost their only food at this period.\n\nSHOP-LIFTERS, are those that steal goods privately out of shops; which, being to the value of 5s. though no person be in the shop, is felony without the benefit of clergy by the 10 and 11 W. III. c. 23.\n\nSHORE, a place washed by the sea, or by some large river.\n\nCount Marsigli divides the sea-shore into three portions: the first of which is that tract of land which the sea just reaches in storms and high tides, but which it never covers; the second part of the shore is that which is covered in high tides and storms, but is dry at other times; and the third is the descent from this, which is always covered with water.\n\nThe first part is only a continuation of the continent, and suffers no alteration from the neighbourhood of the sea, except that it is rendered fit for the growth of some plants, and wholly unfit for that of others, by the saline streams and impregnations: and it is scarce to be conceived by any, but those who have observed it, how far on land the effects of the sea reach, so as to make the earth proper for plants which will not grow without this influence; there being several plants frequently found on high hills and dry places, at three, four, and more miles from the sea, which yet would not grow unless in the neighbourhood of it, nor will ever be found elsewhere.\n\nThe second part or portion of the shore is much more affected by the sea than the former, being frequently washed and beaten by it. Its productions are rendered salt by the water, and it is covered with sand, or with the fragments of shells in form of sand, and in some places with a tartarous matter deposited from the water; the colour of this whole extent of ground is usually dull and dull, especially where there are rocks and stones, and these covered with a slimy matter.\n\nThe third part of the shore is more affected by the sea than either of the others; and is covered with an uniform crust of the true nature of the bottom of the sea, except that plants and animals have their residence in it, and the decayed parts of these alter it a little.\n\nSHORE, Jane, the celebrated concubine of the licentious King Edward IV. was the wife of Mr Matthew Shore, a goldsmith in Lombard-street, London. Kings are seldom unsuccessful in their amorous pursuits; therefore there was nothing wonderful in Mrs Shore's removing from Lombard-street to shine at court as the royal favourite. Historians represent her as extremely beautiful, remarkably cheerful, and of most uncommon generosity. The king, it is said, was no less captivated with her temper than with her person: she never made use of her influence over him to the prejudice of any person; and if ever she importuned him, it was in favour of the unfortunate. After the death of Edward,\nshe attached herself to the lord Hastings; and when Richard III. cut off that nobleman as an obstacle to his ambitious schemes, Jane Shore was arrested as an accomplice, on the ridiculous accusation of witchcraft. This, however, terminated only in a public penance; excepting that Richard rified her of all her little property: but whatever severity might have been exercised towards her, it appears that she was alive, though sufficiently wretched, under the reign of Henry VIII., when Sir Thomas More saw her poor, old, and shrivelled, without the least trace of her former beauty. Mr Rowe, in his tragedy of Jane Shore, has adopted the popular story related in the old historical ballad, of her perishing by hunger in a ditch where Shoreditch now stands. But Stow affirms us that street was so named before her time.\n\nSHORL. See SCHORL, MINERALOGY Index.\n\nSHORLING and MORLING, are words to distinguish fells of sheep; florling being the fells after the fleeces are thrown off the sheep's back; and morling, the fells shed off after they die or are killed. In some parts of England they understand by a florling, a sheep whose face is thrown off; and by a morling, a sheep that dies.\n\nSHORT, JAMES, an eminent optician, was born in Edinburgh on the 10th of June, O.S. in the year 1710. At ten years of age, having lost his father and mother, and being left in a state of indigence, he was received into Heriot's Hospital, (see EDINBURGH, Public Buildings, No 16.), where he soon displayed his mechanical genius in constructing, for himself, little chests, bookcases, and other conveniences, with such tools as fell in his way. At the age of twelve he was removed from the Hospital to the High School, where he showed a considerable taste for classical literature, and generally kept at the head of his forms. In the year 1726 he was entered into the university, where he passed through the usual course of education, and took his master's degree with great applause.\n\nBy his friends he was intended for the church; but after attending a course of theological lectures, his mind revolted from a profession which he thought little suited to his talents; and he devoted his whole time to mathematical and mechanical pursuits. He had been fortunate enough to have the celebrated Mr Lautin for his preceptor; who having soon discovered the bent of his genius, and made a proper estimate of the extent of his capacity, encouraged him to prosecute those studies in which nature had qualified him to make the greatest figure. Under the eye of that eminent master, he began in 1732 to construct Gregorian telescopes; and, as the professor observed in a letter to Dr Jurin, \"by taking care of the figure of his specula, he was enabled to give them larger apertures, and to carry them to greater perfection, than had ever been done before him.\" (See OPTICS, No 89.)\n\nIn the year 1736 Mr Short was called to London, at the desire of Queen Caroline, to give instructions in mathematics to William duke of Cumberland; and immediately on his appointment to that very honourable office he was elected a fellow of the royal society, and patronized by the earls of Morton and Macclesfield. In the year 1739 he accompanied the former of those noble lords to the Orkney isles, where he was employed in adjusting the geography of that part of Scotland; and happy it was for him that he was so employed, as he might otherwise have been involved in a feud which took place between the retainers of Sir James Stewart of Barra and the attendants of the earl, in which some of the latter were dangerously wounded.\n\nMr Short having returned to London, and finally established himself there in the line of his profession, was in 1742 employed by Lord Thomas Spencer to make for him a reflector of twelve feet focus, for which he received 600 guineas. He made several other telescopes of the same focal distance with greater improvements and higher magnifiers; and in 1752 finished one for the king of Spain, for which, with its whole apparatus, he received 1200l. This was the noblest instrument of the kind that had then been constructed, and perhaps it has never yet been surpassed except by the astonishing reflectors of Herschel. See TELESCOPE.\n\nMr Short used to visit the place of his nativity once every two or three years during his residence in London, and in 1766 he visited it for the last time. On the 15th of June 1768 he died, after a very short illness, at Newington Butts, near London, of a mortification in his bowels, and was buried on the 22d of the same month, having completed, within a few days, his fifty-eighth year. He left a fortune of about 20,000l., of which 15,000l. was bequeathed to two nephews, and the rest in legacies to his friends. In gratitude for the steady patronage of the earl of Morton, he left to his daughter the lady Mary Douglas, afterwards countess of Aboyne, 1000l. and the reversion of his fortune, should his nephews die without issue; but this reverendary legacy the lady, at the desire of her father, generously relinquished by a deed in favour of Mr Short's brother Mr Thomas Short and his children. Mr Short's eminence as an artist is universally known, and we have often heard him spoken of by those who were acquainted with him from his youth, as a man of virtue and of very amiable manners.\n\nSHORT-Hand Writing. See STENOGRAPHY.\n\nSHORT-Jointed, in the Manege. A horse is said to be short-jointed that has a short pattern; when this joint, or the pattern is too short, the horse is subject to have his fore-legs from the knee to the coronet all in a straight line. Commonly your short-jointed horses do not manage so well as the long-jointed; but out of the manege the short-jointed are the best for travel or fatigue.\n\nSHORT-Sightedness, a certain defect in vision, by which objects cannot be distinctly seen unless they are very near the eye. See OPTICS, No 142.\n\nSHORTFORD, q. d. fore-cloze, an ancient custom in the city of Exeter, when the lord of the fee cannot be answered rent due to him out of his tenement, and no distress can be levied for the same. The lord is then to come to the tenement, and there take a stone, or some other dead thing off the tenement, and bring it before the mayor and bailiff, and thus he must do seven quarter days successively; and if on the seventh quarter-day the lord is not satisfied of his rent and arrears, then the tenement shall be adjudged to the lord to hold the same a year and a day; and forthwith proclamation is to be made in the court, that if any man claims any title to the said tenement, he must appear within the year and day next following, and satisfy the lord of the said rent and arrears: but if no appearance be made, and the rent not paid, the lord comes again to the court,\nShot, court, and prays that, according to the custom, the said tenement be adjudged to him in his demesne as of fee, which is done accordingly, so that the lord hath from thenceforth the said tenement, with the appurtenances to him and his heirs.\n\nSHOT, a denomination given to all sorts of balls for fire-arms: those for cannon being of iron, and those for guns, pistols, &c. of lead. See SHOOTING.\n\nCafe SHOT formerly consisted of all kinds of old iron, nails, musket-balls, stones, &c. used as above.\n\nSHOT of a Cable, on ship-board, is the splicing of two cables together, that a ship may ride safe in deep waters and in great roads; for a ship will ride easier by one shot of a cable, than by three short cables out ahead.\n\nGrape-SHOT. See GRAPE-Shot.\n\nPatent-milled SHOT is thus made: Sheets of lead, whose thickness corresponds with the size of the shot required, are cut into small pieces, or cubes, of the form of a die. A great quantity of these little cubes are put into a large hollow iron cylinder, which is mounted horizontally and turned by a winch; when by their friction against one another and against the sides of the cylinder, they are rendered perfectly round and very smooth. The other patent shot is cast in moulds, in the same way as bullets are.\n\nSHOT Flaggon, a sort of flaggon somewhat bigger than ordinary, which in some counties, particularly Derbyshire, it is the custom for the host to serve his guests in, after they have drank above a shilling.\n\nSmall SHOT, or that used for fowling, should be well fixed, and of a moderate bigness: for should it be too great, then it flies thin, and scatters too much; or if too small, then it hath not weight and strength to penetrate far, and the bird is apt to fly away with it. In order, therefore, to have it suitable to the occasion, it not being always to be had in every place fit for the purpose, we shall set down the true method of making all sorts and sizes under the name of moulds/shot. Its principal good properties are to be round and solid.\n\nTake any quantity of lead you think fit, and melt it down in an iron vessel; and as it melts keep it stirring with an iron ladle, skimming off all impurities whatsoever that may arise at the top; when it begins to look of a greenish colour, throw on it as much auripigmentum or yellow orpiment, finely powdered, as will lie on a flinting, to every 12 or 14 pound of lead; then stirring them together, the orpiment will flame.\n\nThe ladle should have a notch on one side of the brim, for more easily pouring out the lead; the ladle must remain in the melted lead, that its heat may be the same with that of the lead, to prevent inconveniences which otherwise might happen by its being either too hot or too cold: then, to try your lead, drop a little of it into water, and if the drops prove round, then the lead is of proper heat; if otherwise, and the shot have tails, then add more orpiment to increase the heat, till it be found sufficient.\n\nThen take a plate of copper, about the bigness of a trencher, which must be made with a hollowness in the middle, about three inches compass, within which must be bored about 40 holes according to the size of the shot which you intend to cast: the hollow bottom should be thin; but the thicker the brim, the better it will retain the heat. Place this plate on a frame of iron, over a tub or vessel of water, about four inches from the water, and spread burning coals on the plate, to keep the lead melted upon it: then take some lead and pour it gently on the coals on the plate, and it will make its way through the holes into the water, and form itself into shot; do this till all your lead be run through the holes of the plate, taking care, by keeping your coals alive, that the lead do not cool, and so stop up the holes.\n\nWhile you are casting in this manner, another person with another ladle may catch some of the shot, placing the ladle four or five inches underneath the plate in the water, by which means you will see if they are defective, and rectify them.\n\nYour chief care is to keep the lead in a just degree of heat, that it be not too cold as to stop up the holes in your plate, nor too hot as to cause the shot to crack: to remedy the heat, you must refrain working till it is of a proper coolness; and to remedy the coolness of your lead and plate, you must blow your fire; observing, that the cooler your lead is, the larger will be your shot; as the hotter it is, the smaller they will be.\n\nAfter you have done casting, take them out of the water, and dry them over the fire with a gentle heat, stirring them continually that they do not melt; when dry, you are to separate the great shot from the small, by the help of a sieve made for that purpose, according to their several sizes. But those who would have very large shot, make the lead trickle with a stick out of the ladle into the water, without the plate.\n\nIf it stop on the plate, and yet the plate be not too cool, give but the plate a little knock, and it will run again; care must be had that none of your implements be greasy, oily, or the like; and when the shot, being separated, are found too large or too small for your purpose, or otherwise imperfect, they will serve again at the next operation.\n\nThe sizes of common shot for fowling are from No. 1 to 6, and smaller, which is called mustard seed, or dust shot; but No. 5 is small enough for any shooting whatsoever. The No. 1 may be used for wild geese; the No. 2 for ducks, widgeons, and other water-fowl; the No. 3 for pheasants, partridges after the first month, and all the fen-fowl; the No. 4 for partridges, woodcocks, &c.; and the No. 5 for snipes and all the smaller birds.\n\nTin-Cafe SHOT, in artillery, is formed by putting a great quantity of small iron shot into a cylindrical tin-box called a cannonier, that just fits the bore of the gun. Leaden bullets are sometimes used in the same manner; and it must be observed, that whatever number or sizes of the shots are used, they must weigh with their cases nearly as much as the shot of the piece.\n\nSHOVEL, Sir Clowdesly, was born about the year 1650 of parents rather in the lower rank of life. He was put apprentice to a shoemaker; but disliking this profession, he abandoned it a few years after, and went to sea. He was at first a cabin boy with Sir Christopher Mynde, but applying to the study of navigation with indefatigable industry, his skill as a seaman soon raised him above that station.\n\nThe corsairs of Tripoli having committed great outrages on the English in the Mediterranean, Sir John Narborough was sent in 1674 to reduce them to reason. As he had received orders to try the effects of negociation before he proceeded to hostilities, he sent Mr Shovel,\nShovel, who was at that time a lieutenant in his fleet, to demand satisfaction. The Dey treated him with a great deal of disrespect, and sent him back without an answer. Sir John dispatched him a second time, with orders to remark particularly the situation of things on shore. The behaviour of the Dey was worse than ever. Upon Mr Shovel's return, he informed Sir John that it would be possible, notwithstanding their fortifications, to burn all the ships in the harbour. The boats were accordingly manned, and the command of them given to Lieut. Shovel, who seized the guardship, and burnt four others, without losing a man. This action so terrified the Tripolins, that they sued for peace.—Sir John Narborough gave a favourable account of this exploit, that Mr Shovel was soon after made captain of the Sapphire, a fifth rate ship.\n\nIn the battle of Bantry-Bay, after the revolution, he commanded the Edgar, and, for his gallant behaviour in that action, was soon after knighted by King William. Next year he was employed in transporting an army into Ireland; a service which he performed with so much diligence and dexterity, that the king raised him to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and delivered his commission with his own hands. Soon after he was made rear-admiral of the red, and shared the glory of the victory at La Hogue. In 1694, he bombarded Dunkirk. In 1703, he commanded the grand fleet in the Mediterranean, and did everything in his power to assist the Protestants who were in arms in the Cévennes.\n\nSoon after the battle off Malaga, he was presented by Prince George to Queen Anne, who received him graciously, and next year employed him as commander in chief.\n\nIn 1705 he commanded the fleet, together with the earls of Peterborough and Monmouth, which was sent into the Mediterranean; and it was owing to him chiefly that Barcelona was taken. After an unsuccessful attempt upon Toulon, he failed for Gibraltar, and from thence homeward with a part of the fleet. On the 22d of October, at night, his ship, with three others, was cast away on the rocks of Scilly. All on board perished. His body was found by some fishermen on the island of Scilly, who stripped it of a valuable ring, and afterwards buried it. Mr Paxton, the purser of the Arundel, hearing of this, found out the fellows, and obliged them to discover where they had buried the body. He carried it on board his own ship to Portsmouth, from whence it was conveyed to London, and interred with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey. A monument was afterwards erected to his memory by the direction of the queen. He married the widow of his patron, Sir John Narborough, by whom he left two daughters, co-heiresses.\n\nSHOVELLER, a species of Anas. See Anas, Ornithology Index.\n\nSHOULDER-BLADE, a bone of the shoulder, of a triangular figure, covering the hind part of the ribs, called by anatomists the scapula and omoplata. See Anatomy.\n\nSHOUT, clamour, in antiquity, was frequently used on ecclesiastical, civil, and military occasions, as a sign of approbation, and sometimes of indignation.—Thus as Cicero, in an assembly of the people, was exposing the arrogance of L. Antony, who had had the impudence to cause himself to be inscribed the patron of the Romans, the people on hearing this raised a shout to show their indignation. In the ancient military discipline, shouts were used, 1. Upon occasion of the general's making a speech or harangue to the army from his tribunal. This they did in token of their approving what had been proposed. 2. Before an engagement, in order to encourage and spirit their own men, and fill the enemy with dread. This is a practice of great antiquity; besides which, it wants not the authority of reason to support it; for as mankind are endowed with two senses, hearing and seeing, by which fear is raised in the mind, it may be proper to make use of the ear as well as the eye for that purpose. Shouts were also raised in the ancient theatre, when what was acted pleased the spectators. It was usual for those present at the burning of the dead to raise a great shout, and call the dead person by his name before they set fire to the pile.\n\nSHOWER, in Meteorology, a cloud condensed into rain.\n\nSHREWMOUSE. See Sorex, Mammalia Index.\n\nSHREWSBURY, the capital of Shropshire in England. This town, the metropolis of the county, grew up out of the ruins of Utricium, an ancient city, now a village called Wroxeter, about four miles from it. The Saxons called it Scrobbes Berig, from the shrubs that grew about it; and from thence the present name of Shrewsbury is supposed to have been formed. It is pleasantly situated upon a hill near the Severn, over which there are two handsome bridges. It was a place of note in the Saxon times; after which it was granted by William the Conqueror, together with the title of earl and most of the county, to Roger de Montgomery, who built a castle upon the north side of it, where the Severn, that encompasses it on all other sides, leaves an opening. His son Robert built also a wall across this neck of land, when he revolted from Henry I. We learn from doomsday-book, that at that time, when a widow of this town married, she paid 20 shillings to the king, and a virgin 10. The above-mentioned Roger founded also, and endowed here, a Benedictine monastery and a collegiate church. When old age came upon him, he quitted the world, and spent the rest of his days as a monk in the abbey, and when he died was interred in its church. From the history of this church and monastery, it appears that ecclesiastical benefices about that time were hereditary. The abbey became rich afterwards, that the abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. Besides this abbey, in after times there were three others, viz. a Franciscan, Dominican, and Augustin; and likewise two collegiate churches, one dedicated to St Chad and the other to St Mary. In the contest between the empresses Maud and Stephen, this town and its governor William Fitz-Alan sided with the empresses. In Henry III.'s time, a part of it was burnt down by the Welch; and in Richard II.'s reign a parliament was held in it. At a place called Battlefield, near this town, Henry Percy the younger, surnamed Hotspur, was killed in an engagement with Henry IV., against whom he had rebelled. The king afterwards built a chapel upon the spot, and endowed it for the support of two priests to pray for the souls of the slain. Two of Edward IV.'s sons were born here; namely,\nShrewsbury namely, Richard, duke of York, whom Perkin Warbeck afterwards perforated, and who was murdered in the Tower; and George Plantagenet, who died before his brothers. Here first broke out the sweating-fever, which carried off great numbers so suddenly, that those who were seized with it either died or recovered in the space of 24 hours. In the beginning of the civil wars, King Charles I. came hither, and formed an army, with which he marched towards London; but was met by the parliament's forces at Edgehill. He continued here from the 25th of September to the 12th of October, during which time he was joined by Prince Rupert, and many of the gentry and nobility of these parts. This town anciently gave title of earl to the Montgomerys, and afterwards to the Talbots, by whom it is still retained. Here is a free grammar-school, with three masters, and several others, well endowed by Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth, and not inferior to many colleges in the universities. It has a good library and chapel, and there are several scholarships appropriated to it in the university of Cambridge. Here are also several hospitals, almshouses, and charity-schools. This town is one of the most flourishing in England, having two great weekly markets for corn, cattle, and provisions; and another for Welch cottons and flannels, of which great quantities are sold. A great trade is carried on with the Welch, who bring their commodities hither, as to the common mart of both nations. The town is large and well-built, and the situation extremely pleasant. There is a very beautiful walk called the quay, between the town walls and the Severn, delightfully shaded with rows of lime-trees, so that it is not inferior to the Mall in St James's Park. The town is also noted for its gallantry and politeness, being full of gentry, for whom there are always balls and assemblies once a week all the year round.—Here is a fine house and gardens, which belonged to the earl of Bradford; and in the neighbourhood, at Wroxeter, the Roman highway, called Watling-street, may be seen for several miles, where Roman coins are frequently found. In Shrewsbury are 12 incorporated trading companies; and the corporation has a power to try even capital causes of itself, except high treason. It is said that thigh-bones of dead men have been found here a yard long, and teeth three inches round and three long.\n\nSHRIKE. See Lanius, Ornithology Index.\n\nSHRIMP.

Its length is between 49 and 50 miles, its breadth about 38, and its circumference about 210. It is an inland county, containing 892,000 acres, 167,639 inhabitants, and 15 hundreds, in which are 170 parishes, and 15 market towns. It makes a part of three bishoprics, viz. Hereford, Coventry and Litchfield, and St Asaph. Some part of it lies on the north, and some on the south side of the Severn. Besides the Severn, it is also watered by the Tern or Teifiadue, as it is called in Welch, which flows from the mountains of Radnorshire; and by the Tern, which has its rise and name from one of those pools called teernes, in Staffordshire. All these abound with fish, especially Shropshire trouts, pikes, lampreys, graylings, carp, and eels. The air, especially upon the hills, with which the county abounds, is very wholesome. There is as great a diversity of soil as in most other counties. On the hills, where it is poor, is very good pasture for sheep; and in the low grounds, where it is very rich, along the Severn in particular, there is plenty of grass for bay and black cattle, with all sorts of corn. This county is abundantly provided with fuel, having in it many extensive mines of coal; it has also mines of lead and iron. Over most of the coal-pits in this county lies a stratum or layer of blackish porous rock, of which, by grinding and boiling, they make pitch and tar, which are rather better than the common sort for caulking ships, as they do not crack, but always continue close and smooth. Quarries of lime-stone and iron-stone are common in the county, and the soil in many places is a reddish clay. The abundance of coal and iron-stone in this county has given rise to numerous manufactories.\n\nAs it lies upon the borders of Wales, it was anciently full of castles and walled towns. On the side next that country there was an almost continued line of castles, to guard the county against the inroads and depredations of the Welch. The borders here, as those between England and Scotland, were called marches, and there were certain noblemen entitled barones marchicis, marchiones de marchia Wallie, \"lords of the marches, or marquises of the marches of Wales,\" who were vested with a sort of palatine jurisdiction, held courts of justice to determine controversies, and enjoyed many privileges and immunities, the better to enable and encourage them to protect the county against the incursions of the Welch, and to maintain order amongst the borderers; but they often abused their power, and were the greatest of tyrants.\n\nAs to the ecclesiastical government of the county, the far greater part, namely, all that belongs to the bishoprics of Hereford, and of Litchfield and Coventry, is under the jurisdiction and visitation of the archdeacon of Shrewsbury or Salop, and is divided into several deaneries.\n\nThe Oxford circuit includes in it this county, which sends 12 members to parliament, viz. two for the shire, and two for each of the following towns, Shrewsbury, Ludlow, Wenlock, and Bishop's Castle.\n\nSHROVE-TUESDAY, is the Tuesday after Quinquagesima Sunday, or the day immediately preceding the first of Lent; being so called from the Saxon word fbrive, which signifies \"to confess.\" Hence Shrove-Tuesday signifies Confession-Tuesday; on which day all the people in every parish throughout England (during the Romish times) were obliged to confess their sins, one by one, to their own parish-priests, in their own parish-churches; and, that this might be done the more regularly, the great bell in every parish was rung at ten o'clock (or perhaps sooner), that it might be heard by all, and that they might attend, according to the custom then in use. And though the Romish religion has now given way to the Protestant religion, the custom of ringing the great bell in our ancient parish-churches, at least in some of them, still remains, and obtains in and about London the name of Pancake bell; perhaps, because after the confession it was customary for the several persons to dine on pancakes or fritters. Most churches...\nShrubs, indeed, have rejected that custom of ringing the bell on Shrove-Tuesday; but the usage of dining on pancakes or fritters, and such like provision, still continues.\n\nSHROUDS (from Sax.), a range of large ropes extending from the mast heads to the right and left side of the ship, to support the masts, and enable them to carry sail, &c.\n\nThe shrouds as well as the sails are denominated from the masts to which they belong. Thus they are the main, fore, and mizen shrouds; the main-top-mast, fore-top-mast, or mizen-top mast shrouds; and the main-top-gallant, fore-top-gallant, or mizen-top-gallant shrouds. The number of shrouds by which a mast is sustained, as well as the size of rope of which they are formed, is always in proportion to the size of the mast and the weight of the sail it is intended to carry.\n\nBowspit shrouds are those which support the bowspit. Bumkin shrouds are those which support the bumkins. Futtock shrouds are shrouds which connect the efforts of the topmast shrouds to the lower shrouds. Bentinck shrouds are additional shrouds to support the masts in heavy gales. Preventer shrouds are similar to bentinck shrouds, and are used in bad weather to ease the lower rigging. See Mast and Sail.\n\nSHRUB, frutex, a little, low, dwarf tree, or a woody vegetable, of a size less than a tree; and which, instead of one single item, frequently from the same root puts forth several sets or stems. See Plant and Tree. Such are privet, phillyrea, holly, box, honey-suckle, &c. Shrubs and trees put forth in autumn a kind of buttons, or gems, in the axis of the leaves; these buttons are so many little ova, which, coming to expand by the warmth of the following spring, open into leaves and flowers. By this, together with the height, some distinguish shrubs from suffrutesces, or under shrubs, which are low bushes, that do not put forth any of these buttons, as sage, thyme, &c.\n\nThe two hardiest shrubs we are possessed of are the ivy and box; these stand the severity of our sharpest winters unhurt, while other shrubs perish, and trees have their solid bodies split and torn to pieces. In the hard winter of the year 1683, these two shrubs suffered no injury anywhere; though the yews and hollies, which are generally supposed very hardy, were that winter in some places killed, and in others stripped of their leaves, and damaged in their bark. Furze-bushes were found to be somewhat harder than these, but they sometimes perished, at least down to the root. The broom seemed to occupy the next step of hardiness beyond these. This lived where the others died, and where even this died, the juniper shrubs were sometimes found unhurt. This last is the only shrub that approaches to the hardiness of the box and ivy, but even it does not quite come up to them; for while they suffer nothing in whatever manner they are exposed, the juniper, though it bears cold well under the shelter of other trees, yet cannot bear the vicissitudes of heat and cold; insomuch that some juniper shrubs were found half dead and half vigorous; that side which faced the mid-day sun having perished by the succeeding thawings and freezings of its sap; while that which was not exposed to the vicissitudes of heat had born the cold perfectly well. Such shrubs as are not hardy enough to defy the winter, but appear half dead in the spring, may often be recovered by Mr Evelyn's method of beating their branches with a slender hazel-wand, to strike off the withered leaves and buds, and give a free passage to the air to the internal parts. Where this fails, the method is to cut them down to the quick, and if no part of the trunk appears in a growing condition, they must be taken off down to the level of the ground. Philosophical Transactions, No. 165.\n\nSHUTTLE, in the manufactures, an instrument used by the weavers, which guides the thread it contains, either of woollen, silk, flax, or other matter, so as to make it form the woofs of stuffs, cloths, linens, ribbands, &c., by throwing the shuttle alternately from left to right, and from right to left, across between the threads of the warp, which are stretched out lengthwise on the loom.\n\nIn the middle of the shuttle is a kind of cavity, called the eye or chamber of the shuttle; wherein is inclosed the spool, which is a part of the thread destined for the woof; and this is wound on a little tube of paper, rush, or other matter.\n\nThe ribbon-weaver's shuttle is very different from that of most other weavers, though it serves for the same purpose: it is of box, six or seven inches long, one broad, and as much deep; fitted with iron at both ends, which terminate in points, and are a little crooked, the one towards the right, and the other towards the left, representing the figure of an \"o\" horizontally placed. See Weaving.\n\nSIALOGOGUES, medicines which promote the salivary discharge.\n\nSIAM PROPER, by some called Upper, (to distinguish it from the Lower Siam, under which are often included Laos, Cambodia, and Malacca,) is bounded on the north by the kingdoms of Pegu and Laos; on the east by Cambodia and Cochin-China; on the south by Malacca and the bay of Siam; and on the west by the ocean. But as the opinions of geographers are extremely various concerning the situation and extent of most of the inland countries of Asia and Africa, neither the extent nor boundaries of Siam are yet accurately known. By some it is supposed to extend 350 miles in length, and 250 miles in breadth; in some places it is not above 50 miles broad.\n\nThe winds blow here from the south upon the coast of Siam, in March, April, and May; in April the rains begin, in May and June they fall almost without ceasing. In July, August, and September, the winds blow from the west, and the rains continuing, the rivers overflow their banks nine or ten miles on each side, and for more than 150 miles up the stream. At this time, and more particularly in July, the tides are so strong as to come up the river Menan as far as the city of Siam, which is situated 60 miles from its mouth; and sometimes as far as Louvo, which is 50 miles higher. The winds blow from the west and north in October, when the rain ceases. In November and December the winds blow dry from the north, and the waters being in a few days reduced to their ancient channels, the tides become so inefﬁble, that the water is fresh at the mouth of the river. At Siam there is never more than one flood and one ebb in the space of 24 hours. In January the wind blows from the east, and in February from the east and south. When the wind is at east, the\nthe current sets to the west; and, on the contrary, when the wind is at west, the currents run to the eastward.\n\nAs this country is situated near the tropic, it must necessarily be very hot; but yet, as in other places nearly of the same latitude, when the sun is vertical and shines with a most intense heat, the inhabitants are so screened by the clouds, and the air is so refreshed by a deluge of rain that overflows the plains which the people chiefly inhabit, that the heat is very supportable. The coolest wind blows in December and January.\n\nThe vegetable produce of this country is chiefly rice and wheat, besides tropical and a few European fruits. The Siamese prepare the land for tillage as soon as the earth is sufficiently moistened by the floods. They plant their rice before the waters rise to any considerable height, and, as they rise slowly, the rice keeps pace with them, and the ear is always above the water. They reap their corn when the water retires, and sometimes go in boats to cut it while the waters are upon the ground. They also sow rice in several parts of the kingdom that are not overflowed, and this is thought better tilled, and will keep longer than the other; but they are forced to supply these fields constantly with water, while the rice is growing, from basins and ponds that lie about them.\n\nThey have no European fruits except oranges, lemons, citrons, and pomegranates. They have bananas, Indian figs, jagues, durians, mangoes, mangotans, tamarinds, ananas, and cocoa nuts; they have also abundance of pepper and sugar-canes. The mountains are covered with trees which make good mats. The vegetable of greatest use in the country is the bamboo, which grows chiefly in marshy soils, and is often found of a prodigious size. Cotton trees are found in great numbers; and others that yield copoea, a very fine cotton wool, but so short as to be unfit for spinning, though it answers very well for stuffing mattresses and pillows.\n\nThere is no country where elephants abound more than in Siam, or where they are held in greater veneration. They have a few horses, sheep, and goats, besides oxen and buffaloes; but they have no good animal food except the flesh of hogs, their beef and mutton being of a very indifferent quality.\n\nThe Siamese are of small stature, but well proportioned; their complexions are swarthy: the faces of both the men and women are broad, and their foreheads, suddenly contracting, terminate in a point, as well as their chins. They have small black eyes, hollow jaws, large mouths, and thick pale lips. Their teeth are dyed black, their noses are short and round at the end, and they have large ears, which they think very beautiful. Their hair is thick and lank, and both sexes cut it so short that it reaches no lower than their ears; the women make it stand up on their foreheads; and the men shave their beards.\n\nPeople of distinction wear a piece of calico tied about their loins, that reaches down to their knees.—The men bring up this cloth between their legs, and tuck it into their girdles, which gives it the appearance of a pair of breeches. They have also a muslin shirt without a collar, with wide sleeves, no wristbands, and the bottom open. In winter they wear a piece of stuff or painted linen over their shoulders, like a mantle, and wind it about their arms.\n\nThe king of Siam is distinguished by wearing a vest of brocaded satin, with straight sleeves that reach down to the wrist, under such a fluff as we have just described, and it is unlawful for any subject to wear this dress unless he receives it from the king. They wear slippers with piked toes turned up, but no stockings. The king sometimes presents a military vest to the generals; this is buttoned before, and reaches to the knees; but the sleeves are wide, and come no lower than the elbows. All the retinue of the king, either in war or in hunting, are clothed in red. The king wears a cap in the form of a sugar-loaf, encompassed by a coronet or circle of precious stones, and those of his officers have a circle of gold, silver, or of vermilion gilt, to distinguish their quality; and these caps are fastened with a flay under the chin; they are only worn when they are in the king's presence, or when they preside in courts of justice, and on other extraordinary occasions. They have also hats for travelling; but, in general, few people cover their heads notwithstanding the scorching heat of the sun.\n\nThe women also wrap a cloth about their middle, which hangs down to the calf of their legs. They cover their breasts with another cloth, the ends of which hang over their shoulders. But they have no garment corresponding to a shift, nor any covering for their heads but their hair. The common people are almost naked, and wear neither shoes nor slippers. The women wear as many rings on the three last fingers of each hand as they can keep on, and bracelets upon their wrists and ankles, with pendants in their ears shaped like a pear.\n\nFor an inferior to stand before a superior is deemed insolent; and therefore slaves and people of inferior and rank fit upon their heels, with their heads a little inclined, and their joined hands lifted up to their foreheads. In paying by a superior they bend their bodies, joining their hands, and lifting them toward their heads in proportion to the respect they would show. When an inferior pays a visit, he enters the room stooping, prostrates himself, and then remains upon his knees, fitting upon his heels without speaking a word till he is addressed by the person whom he visits; for he that is of the highest quality must always speak first. If a person of rank visits an inferior, he walks upright, and the master of the house receives him at the door, and waits on him so far when he goes away, but never farther.\n\nThe highest part of the house is esteemed the most honourable, and no person cares to lodge under another's feet. The Siamese indeed have but one story, but the rooms rise gradually, and the innermost, which are the highest, are always the most honourable. When the Siamese ambassador came to the French court, some of his retinue were lodged in a floor over the ambassador's head; but they no sooner knew it, than they were struck with the greatest consternation, and ran down tearing their hair at the thoughts of being guilty of what they considered as so unpardonable a crime.\n\nThe Siamese never permit such familiarities as are practised by gentlemen in Europe. Easiness of access, and\nand affability to inferiors, is in that part of the world thought a sign of weakness, and yet they take no notice of some things which would be looked upon as ill breeding among us; such as belching in company, which no man endeavours to prevent, or so much as holds his hand before his mouth. They have an extraordinary respect for the head, and it is the greatest affront to stroke or touch that of another person; nay, their cap must not be used with too much familiarity; for when a servant carries it, it is put on a stick and held above his head; and when the matter stands still the stick is set down, it having a foot to stand upon. They also show their respect by lifting their hands to the head; and therefore, when they receive a letter from any one for whom they have a great respect, they immediately hold it up to their heads, and sometimes lay it upon their heads.\n\nThey are esteemed an ingenious people, and though rather indolent than active in disposition, they are not addicted to the voluptuous vices which often accompany a state of ease, being remarkably chaste and temperate, and even holding drunkenness in abhorrence.—They are, however, accounted insolent towards their inferiors, and equally obsequious to those above them; the latter of which qualities appears to be particularly inculcated from their earliest youth. In general, their behaviour is extremely modest, and they are averse to loquacity. Like the Chinese, they avoid speaking in the first person: and when they address a lady, it is always with some respectful epithet, intimating personal accomplishments.\n\nNo man in this country learns any particular trade, but has a general knowledge of all that are commonly practised, and every one works six months for the king by rotation; at which time, if he should be found perfectly ignorant of the business he is set about, he is doomed to suffer the battainado. The consequence of this burdensome service is, that no man endeavours to excel in his business, lest he should be obliged to practise it as long as he lives for the benefit of the crown.\n\nThe government of this country is extremely oppressive, the king being not only sovereign but proprietor of all the lands, and chief merchant likewise; by which means he monopolizes almost the whole traffic, to the great prejudice of his subjects. The crown is said to be hereditary, but it is often transferred by revolutions, on account of the exorbitant abuse of power in those who exercise the royal office. In his palace, the king is attended by women, who not only prepare his food, and wait on him at table, but even perform the part of valets, and put on all his clothes, except his cap, which is considered as too sacred to be touched by any hand but his own. He shows himself to the people only twice a-year, when he distributes his alms to the talapoins or priests: and on those occasions he always appears in an elevated situation, or mounted on the back of an elephant. When he takes the diversion of hunting, he is as usual attended by his women on foot, preceded by a guard of 200 men, who drive all the people from the roads through which they are to pass; and when the king stops, all his attendants fall upon their faces on the ground.\n\nAll their proceedings in law are committed to writing, and none is suffered to exhibit a charge against another, without giving security to prosecute it, and answer the damages if he does not prove the fact against the person accused. When a person intends to prosecute another, he draws up a petition, in which he sets forth his complaint, and presents it to the nai, or head of the band to which he belongs, who transmits it to the governor; and if the complaint appears frivolous, the prosecutor, according to the laws of the country, should be punished; but the magistrates generally encourage prosecutions on account of the perquisites they bring to their office.\n\nEvery thing being prepared for hearing, the parties are several days called into court, and persuaded to agree; but this appears to be only a matter of form. At length the governor appoints a day for all parties to attend; and being come into court, the clerk reads the process and opinion of his associates, and then the governor examines upon what reasons their opinions are founded; which being explained to him, he proceeds to pass judgement.\n\nWhen sufficient proofs are wanting, they have recourse to an ordeal trial, like that of our Saxon ancestors; florists: both the plaintiff and the defendant walk upon burning coals, and he that escapes unhurt is adjudged to be in the right: sometimes the proof is made by putting their hands in boiling oil; and in both these trials, by some peculiar management, one or the other is said to remain unhurt. They have also a proof by water, in which he who remains longest under it is esteemed innocent. They have another proof, by swallowing pills, which their priests administer with severe imprecations; and the party who keeps them in his stomach without vomiting is thought to be innocent.\n\nAll these trials are made in the presence of the magistrates and people; and the king himself frequently directs them to be performed, when crime comes before him by way of appeal. Sometimes he orders both the informer and prisoner to be thrown into the tigers: and the person that escapes by his not being seized upon by those beasts, is sufficiently justified.\n\nThey maintain the doctrine of transmigration, believing in a pre-existent state, and that they shall pass into other bodies till they are sufficiently purified to be received into paradise. They believe likewise that the soul is material, but not subject to the touch; that it retains the human figure after quitting a body of that species; and that when it appears to persons with whom it was acquainted, which they suppose it to do, the wounds of one that has been murdered will then be visible. They are of opinion that no man will be eternally punished; that the good, after several transmigrations, will enjoy perpetual happiness; but that those who are not reformed will be doomed to transmigration to all eternity. They believe in the existence of a Supreme Being; but the objects of their adoration are departed saints, whom they consider as mediators or intercessors for them; and to the honour of this numerous tribe both temples and images are erected.\n\nThe men of this country are allowed a plurality of wives; but excepting one, who is a wife by contract, the others are only concubines, and their children deemed incapable of any legal inheritance. Previous to every nuptial contract, an astrologer must be consulted, who calculates the nativity of the parties, and determines whether their union is likely to prove fortunate.\nSIBERIA; a large country, comprehending the most northerly parts of the Russian empire in Asia. It is bounded on the east by the eastern ocean; on the south by Great Tartary; on the west by Russia; and on the north by the Frozen ocean. It is about 2000 miles in length from east to west, and 750 miles in breadth from north to south.\n\nAt what time this country was first inhabited, or Conquered by whom it was peopled, we are entirely ignorant; but writings have been found in it when it was discovered, which shows that it must have been early known to a civilized people. The Russians, from whom we have Bell's Travels received our knowledge, knew nothing of it before the middle of the 16th century. In the reign of John Baflovitz I., indeed, an incursion had been made into Siberia, and some Tartar tribes subdued: but these conquests were not permanent; and we hear of no further communication between Russia and Siberia till the time of John Baflovitz II. It was opened again at that time by means of one Anika Stroganoff, a Russian merchant, who had established some salt-works at a town in the government of Archangel. This man carried on a trade with the inhabitants of the north-west parts of Siberia, who brought every year to the town above-mentioned large quantities of the finest furs. Thus he acquired a very considerable fortune in a short time; when at last the czar, perceiving the advantages which would accrue to his subjects from having a regular intercourse with Siberia, determined to enlarge the communication which was already opened. With this view he sent into Siberia a body of troops, which crossed the Yugarian mountains, that form part of the north-eastern boundary of Europe. They seem, however, not to have passed the Irithi, or to have penetrated farther than the western branch of the river Obi. Some Tartar tribes were laid under contribution, and a chief named Yediger consented to pay an annual tribute of 1000 fables. But this produced no lasting advantage to Russia; for, soon after, Yediger was defeated and taken prisoner by Kutchum Khan, a descendant of the great Jenghiz Khan; and thus the allegiance of this country to Russia was dissolved.\n\nFor some time we hear of no further attempts made by the Russians on Siberia; but in 1577 the foundation of a permanent conquest was laid by one Yermac Temofeef, a Cossack of the Don. This man was at first the head of a party of banditti who infested the Russians in the province of Casan; but being defeated by the troops of the czar, he retired with 6000 of his followers into the interior parts of that province. Continuing his course still easterly, he came to Orel, the most easterly of all the Russian settlements. Here he took up his winter-quarters: but his restless genius did not suffer him to continue for any length of time in a state of inactivity; and from the intelligence he procured concerning the situation of the neighbouring Tartars of Siberia, he turned his arms towards that quarter.\n\nSiberia was at that time partly divided among a number of separate princes, and partly inhabited by the various tribes of independent Tartars. Of the former Kutchum Khan, was the most powerful sovereign. His dominions consisted of that tract of country which now forms the south-western part of the province of Tobolik; and stretched from the banks of the Irithi and Obi to those\nSiberia.\n\nthole of the Tobol and Tura. His principal residence was at Sibir, a small fortress upon the river Irtish, not far from the present town of Tobolsk, and of which some ruins are still to be seen. After a course of unremitting fatigue, and a series of victories which almost exceed belief, but of which we have not room to give the detail, our intrepid adventurer dispossessed this prince of his dominions, and seated himself on the throne of Sibir. The number of his followers, however, being greatly reduced, and perceiving he could not depend on the affection of his new subjects, he had recourse to the czar of Mucovoy, and made a tender of his new acquisitions to that monarch, upon condition of receiving immediate and effectual support. This proposal was received with the greatest satisfaction by the czar, who granted him a pardon for all former offences, and sent him the required succours. Yermac, however, being soon after drowned in an unsuccessful excursion, the Russians began to lose their footing in the country. But fresh reinforcements being feebly sent, they not only recovered their ground, but pushed their conquests far and wide; wherever they appeared, the Tartars were either reduced or exterminated. New towns were built, and colonies were planted on all sides. Before a century had well elapsed, all that vast tract of country now called Siberia, which stretches from the confines of Europe to the Eastern ocean, and from the Frozen sea to the present frontiers of China, was annexed to the Russian dominions.\n\nThe air of Siberia is, in general, extremely piercing, climate, the cold there being more severe than in any other part of the Russian dominions. The Siberian rivers are frozen very early, and it is late in the spring before the ice is thawed (A). If the corn does not ripen in August, there is little hope of a harvest in this country; and in\n\n(A) M. Gmelin, M. Muller, and two other philosophers, set out in the year 1733 to explore the dreary regions of Siberia, by desire of the empress Anne of Russia. After spending nine years and a half in observing every thing that was remarkable, they returned to Petersburgh; and an account of this journey was published by M. Gmelin. In order to examine how far the frost had penetrated into the ground, M. Gmelin, on the 18th of June, at a place called Jacutia, ordered the earth to be dug in high ground; they found mould to the depth of 11 inches, under which they met with loose sand to two feet and a half further, after which it grew harder, and at half a foot deeper so hard as scarcely to give way to the tools; so that the ground still remained unthawed at not less than the depth of four feet. He made the same experiment in a lower situation; the soil was 10 inches deep, after that a loose sand for two feet and ten inches, below which all was frozen and hard. At Jacutia the inhabitants preserve in cellars several sorts of berries, which they reckon among their dainties, perfectly good and fresh the whole year, though these cellars are scarcely a fathom deep. At the fortresses of Argun, in little more than 50 degrees of latitude, the inhabitants relate that the earth in many places is never thawed above a yard and a half, and that the internal cold of the earth will scarcely permit a well to be dug, of which they bring an instance that happened not long before the author's arrival at that place. They designed to sink a well near a house at some distance from the river Argun, for which purpose they thawed the earth by degrees, and dug some fathoms till they had penetrated a fathom and half below the level of the river, but found no spring. Hence perhaps we may venture to assert, that besides the great elevation of the earth in these countries, there is another cause, perhaps latent in the earth itself, of this extraordinary cold, naturally suggested to us by considering the cavity of an old silver mine at Argun, which being exhausted of its ore, now serves the inhabitants in summer time for a cellar to keep their provisions: this place is so extremely cold as to preserve flesh meats from putrefaction in the hottest summers, and to sink the mercury in De Lisle's thermometer to 146 and 147. The author travelling from Nerchchoi towards Argun, to visit the works of the silver mines in that place, August 1733, came to the river Orkja, near Solonichkaia, on July the 1st, from whence he arrived a little before dark at the village of Seventua, distant from the river 27 leagues. In this journey he and his fellow travellers for more than four leagues felt it vastly cold; soon after they came into a warm air, which continued some leagues; after which the cold returned; and thus are travellers subjected to perpetual vicissitudes of warmth and cold. But it is observed in general, that the eastern parts are colder than the western, though situated in the same latitude; for as in those eastern regions some tracts of land are much colder than the rest, their effects must be felt by the neighbouring parts. And this conjecture is favoured by the thermometrical observations made with M. de L'Isle's instrument in all parts of Siberia, in which the mercury was depressed to the 226th degree, even in those parts that lie very much towards the south, as in the territory of Selenga, which said degree answers in Fahrenheit's thermometer to about 55.5 below 0, but the same thermometer sometimes indicated a much greater cold. At the fort of Kirinja, on Feb. 10, 1738, at 8 in the morning, the mercury stood at 240, which answers nearly to 72 below 0 in Fahrenheit's. On the 23d of the same month it was a degree lower. At the same place, December 11, at three in the afternoon, it stood at 254 in IX. Lisle's thermometer, and very near 90 in Fahrenheit's; on December 29, at four in the afternoon, at 263; on November 27, at noon, at 270; January 9, at 275, which several depressions answer in Fahrenheit's to 99.44, 107.73, and 113.65; on January 5, at five in the morning, at 262; an hour after at 281, but at eight o'clock it returned to 250, and there remained till six in the afternoon, and then rose by degrees till an hour before midnight, when it stood at 222. So that the greatest depression of the mercury answers in Fahrenheit's thermometer to 120.76 degrees below 0, which is indeed very surprising, and what nobody ever imagined before. While this cold lasted at Jenisseia, the sparrows and magpies fell to the ground, struck dead, as it were, with the frost, but revived if they were soon brought into a warm room. The author was told also that numbers of wild beasts were found in the woods dead and stiff with the frost, and several travellers had their blood and juices quite frozen in their vessels. The air itself at that time was so dilmal, that you would think it changed to ice, as it was a thick fog, which was not dispellable by any exhalations, as in the spring and autumn, and the author could scarcely stand three minutes in the porch of his house for the cold.\nthe province of Jeniseisk it is sometimes covered with snow before the peasants can reap it. To defend the inhabitants against this extreme severity of the climate, Providence seems more liberally to have dealt out to them wood for fuel and furs for clothing. As the winter days in the north parts of Siberia last but a few hours, and the storms and flakes of snow darken the air so much, that the inhabitants, even at noon, cannot see to do any thing without artificial lights, they sleep away the greatest part of that season.\n\nThese severe winters are rapidly succeeded by summers, in which the heat is so intense that the Tungusians, who live in the province of Jakutsk, go almost naked. Here is scarcely any night during that season; and towards the Frozen ocean the sun appears continual- ly above the horizon. The vegetables and fruits of the earth are here extremely quick in their growth.\n\nThe whole tract of land beyond the 60th degree of north latitude is a barren waste; for the north part of Siberia yields neither corn nor fruits; though barley is known frequently to come to perfection in Jakutsk.—For this reason, the inhabitants of the northern parts are obliged to live on fish and flesh, but the Ruffians are supplied with corn from the southern parts of Siberia, where the soil is surprisingly fertile. The countries beyond the lake of Baikal, especially towards the east, as far as the river Argun, are remarkably fruitful and pleasant; but such is the indolence of the inhabitants, that several fine tracts of land, which would make ample returns to the peasant for cultivating them, lie neglected. The pastures are excellent in this country, which abounds in fine horned cattle, horses, goats, &c., on which the Tartars chiefly depend for subsistence. However, there are several steppes, or barren wastes, and unimproveable tracts in these parts; and not a single fruit tree is to be seen. There is great variety of vegetables, and in several places, particularly near Krafpoia Sloboda, the ground is in a manner overrun with asparagus of an extraordinary height and delicious flavour. The bulbs of the Turkish lilies, and other sorts of lilies, are much used by the Tartars instead of bread. This want of fruit and corn is richly compensated by the great quantities of wild and tame beasts, and fowls, and the infinite variety of fine fish which the country affords (b).\n\nIn that part of Siberia which lies near the Icy sea, as well as in several other places, are woods of pine, larch, and other trees; besides which, a considerable quantity of wood is thrown ashore by the waves of the Icy sea; but whence it comes is not yet ascertained.\n\nBesides the wild fowl with which Siberia abounds, there is a prodigious number of quadrupeds, some of which are eatable, and others valuable for their skins or furs.\n\nThe animals most valued for their skins are the black fox, the sable, the hyena, the ermine, the squirrel, the beaver, and the lynx. The skin of a real black fox is more esteemed than even that of a sable. In the country near the Frozen ocean are also blue and white foxes. The finest fables come from Nerthinsk and Jakutsk, the inhabitants of which places catch them in the mountains of Stannowoi Krebet. The tributary nations were formerly obliged to pay their taxes in the skins of foxes and sables only. But now the skins of squirrels, bears, rein-deer, &c., and sometimes money, are received by way of tribute; and this not only from those who live near the Lena, but also in the governments of Ilimsk, Irkutsk, Selenginsk, and Nerthinsk. When the Tartars first became tributary to Russia, they brought their furs indiscriminately as they caught them, and among them were often fables of extraordinary value; and formerly, if any trader brought with him an iron kettle, they gave him in exchange for it as many fables as it would hold. But they are now better acquainted with their value. They sell their fables to smugglers at a very high price, and pay only a ruble instead of a skin to the revenue officers, who now receive more ready money than fables, by way of tribute. The subjects plead the scarcity of furs, and indeed not without some appearance of truth.\n\nSiberia has still other and more valuable treasures than minerals, those we have yet mentioned. The silver mines of Argun are extremely rich; the silver they produce yields some gold, and both of these are found among the copper ore of Kolivan. This country is also particularly rich in copper and iron ore. The former lies even upon the surface of the earth; and considerable mines of it are found in the mountains of Piitlow, Kolivan, Plozkau, Wolkerefenik, Kufwi, Alepaki, and several others, and in the government of Krafnoirik (c). Iron is still more plentiful in all these places, and very good; but that of Kamenfki is reckoned the best. Several hundred thousand puds of these metals are annually exported from the melting houses, which belong partly to the crown, and partly to private persons. Most of them lie in the government of Catharinenburg. The Tartars also extract a great quantity of iron from the ore.\n\nThe topazes of Siberia have a fine lustre; and in open sandy places, near the river Argun, as well as on the banks of other rivers and lakes, are found fine small pieces of agate. Here are also carnelians and green jasper with red veins. The latter is chiefly met with in the deserts of Gobiiskoi.\n\nThe famous marienglas, or lapis specularis, great quantities of\n\n(b) The oak, though frequent in Russia, it is said, is not to be found through this vast region nearer than the banks of the Argun and Amur, in the dominions of China. The white poplar, the aspen, the black poplar, the common fallow, and several species of the willow, are very common. The Norway and silver fir form great forests; but the former does not grow beyond the 60th degree of north latitude, and the latter not beyond 58 degrees. To this dreary region of Siberia, Europe is indebted for that excellent species of oats called Avena Siberica; and our gardens are enlivened with the gay and brilliant flowers brought from the same country.\n\n(c) The copper mines of Kolivan, from which gold and silver are extracted, employ above 40,000 people. The silver mines of Nerthinsk, beyond Lake Baikal, employ above 14,000. The whole revenue arising from these mines, according to Mr. Cope, is not less than £79,182. 13s.\nquantities of which are dug up in Siberia, is by some called Maloy or Russian glass. It is a particular species of transparent stone, lying in strata like so many sheets of paper. The matrix, or stone in which it is found, is partly a light yellow quartz, or marcasite, and partly a brown indurated fluid; and this stone contains in it all the species of the marieglass. To render the marieglass fit for use, it is split with a thin two-edged knife; but care is taken that the laminae be not too thin. It is used for windows and lanterns all over Siberia, and indeed in every part of the Russian empire, and looks very beautiful; its lustre and clearness surpassing that of the finest glass, to which it is particularly preferable for windows and lanterns of ships, as it will stand the explosion of cannon. It is found in the greatest plenty near the river Vitim.\n\nSiberia affords magnets of an extraordinary size, and even whole mountains of lodestone. Pit-coal is also dug up in the northern parts of this country. The kamennoe mala, a yellowish kind of alum, unctuous and smooth to the touch, like topaz, is found in the mountains of Krafnoiark, Ural, Altai, Jenisei, Baikal, Bargusik, Lena, and several others in Siberia.\n\nIn this country are not only a great number of fresh water lakes, but likewise several whose waters are salt; and these reciprocally change their nature, the salt sometimes becoming fresh, and the fresh changing into saline. Some lakes also dry up, and others appear where none were ever seen before. The salt lake of Yamulka, in the province of Tobolik, is the most remarkable of all, for it contains a salt as white as snow, consisting entirely of cubic crystals. One finds also in Siberia saline springs, salt water brooks, and a hill of salt.\n\nSiberia affords many other things which deserve notice. That useful root called rhubarb grows in vast quantities near the city of Seleginsk. The curious mammoth's bones and horns, as they are called, which are found along the banks of the Ob, Jenisei, Lena, and Irtysh, are unquestionably the teeth and bones of elephants. But whether these elephants' teeth and bones were conveyed to these northern regions by the general deluge, or by any other inundation, and were by degrees covered with earth, is a point which might lead us into long and very fruitless disputations; we shall therefore only observe, that such bones have likewise been found in Russia, and even in several parts of Germany. A kind of bones of a still larger size than these have also been dug up in Siberia, and seem to have belonged to an animal of the ox kind. The horn of the whale called narwhal has been found in the earth near the rivers Indigirka and Anadri; and the teeth of another species of whales, called walruses, about Anadirko. The latter are larger than the common sort, which are brought from Greenland, Archangel, and Kola.\n\nThe chain of Siberian mountains reaches from that of Werchoturiac towards the south as far as the neighbourhood of the city of Orelburg, in a continued ridge, under the name of the Uralian mountains; but from thence it alters its direction westward. These mountains are a kind of boundary between Russia Proper and Siberia. Another chain of hills divides Siberia from the country of the Calmucks and Mongolians.—These mountains, between the rivers Irtysh and Ob, are called the Altai or Golden Mountains, which name they afterwards lost, particularly between the river Jenisei and the Baikal lake, where they are called the Sayanian Siberia mountains.\n\nThe inhabitants of Siberia consist of the Aborigines or ancient inhabitants, the Tartars, and Russians, computed at 3,500,000.\n\nSome of these nations have no other religion but that of nature; others are Pagans or Mahometans, and some of them have been converted to Christianity, or rather only baptised by the Russian missionaries.\n\nSIBTHORPIA, a genus of plants belonging to the class of dicotyledons, and to the order of angiospermae; and in the natural system clasped with those the order of which is doubtful. See Botany Index.\n\nSIBYLS, in pagan antiquity, certain women said to have been endowed with a prophetic spirit, and to have delivered oracles, showing the fates and revolutions of kingdoms. Their number is unknown. Plato Lempel speaks of one, others of two, Pliny of three, Athenaeus four, and Varro of ten; an opinion which is universally adopted by the learned. These ten Sibyls generally resided in the following places, Persia, Libya, Delphi, Cumae in Italy, Erythrae, Samos, Cumae in Aegina, Marpepla on the Hellepont, Ancyra in Paphlagonia, and Tiburtis. The most celebrated of the Sibyls is that of Cumae in Italy, whom some have called by the different names of Amalthea, Demophile, Herothele, Daphne, Manto, Phemonoe, and Deiphobe. It is said, that Apollo became enamoured of her, and that to make her sensible of his passion he offered to give her whatever she should ask. The Sibyl demanded to live as many years as the sand grains of sand in her hand, but unfortunately forgot to ask for the enjoyment of the health, vigour, and bloom, of which she was then in possession. The god granted her request, but she refused to gratify the passion of her lover though he offered her perpetual youth and beauty. Some time after she became old and decrepit, her form decayed, melancholy pallidness and haggard looks succeeded to bloom and cheerfulness. She had already lived about 750 years when Aeneas came to Italy, and, as some have imagined, she had three centuries more to live before her years were as numerous as the grains of sand which she had in her hand. She gave Aeneas instructions how to find his father in the infernal regions, and even conducted him to the entrance of hell. It was usual for the Sibyl to write her prophecies on leaves, which she placed at the entrance of her cave; and it required particular care in such as consulted her to take up these leaves before they were defiled by the wind, as their meaning then became incomprehensible. According to the most authentic historians of the Roman republic, one of the Sibyls came to the palace of Tarquin the Second, with nine volumes, which she offered to sell for a very high price. The monarch disregarded her, and she immediately disappeared, and soon after returned, when she had burned three of the volumes. She asked the same price for the remaining six books; and when Tarquin refused to buy them, she burned three more, and still persisted in demanding the same sum of money for the three that were left.—This extraordinary behaviour astonished Tarquin; he bought the books, and the Sibyl instantly vanished, and never after appeared to the world. These books were preserved with great care by the monarch, and called the Sibylline verses. A college of priests was appointed to have the care of them; and such reverence did the Romans\nRomans entertain for these prophetic books, that they were consulted with the greatest solemnity, and only when the state seemed to be in danger. When the capitol was burnt in the troubles of Sylla, the Sibylline verses which were deposited there perished in the conflagration; and to repair the loss which the republic seemed to have sustained, commissioners were immediately sent to different parts of Greece to collect whatever verses could be found of the inspired writings of the Sibyls. The fate of these Sibylline verses which were collected after the conflagration of the capitol is unknown. There are now many Sibylline verses extant, but they are reckoned universally spurious; and it is evident that they were composed in the second century by some of the followers of Christianity, who wished to convince the heathens of their error, by afflicting the cause of truth with the arms of pious artifice.\n\nSICERA, a name given to any intoxicating liquor by the Hellenistic Jews. St Chrysostom, Theodore, and Theophilus of Antioch, who were Syrians, and who therefore ought to know the signification and nature of \"sacer,\" assure us, that it properly signifies palm-wine. Pliny acknowledges, that the wine of the palm tree was very well known through all the east, and that it was made by taking a bushel of the dates of the palm-tree, and throwing them into three gallons of water; then squeezing out the juice, it would intoxicate like wine. The wine of the palm tree is white: when it is drunk new, it has the taste of the cocoa, and is sweet as honey. When it is kept longer, it grows strong, and intoxicates. After long keeping, it becomes vinegar.\n\nSICILIAN, in Music, denotes a kind of gay sprightly air, or dance, probably invented in Sicily, somewhat of the nature of an English jig; usually marked with the characters $\\frac{6}{8}$ or $\\frac{12}{8}$. It consists of two strains; the first of four, and the second of eight, bars or measures.\n\nSICILY, is a large island in the Mediterranean sea, adjoining to the northern extremity of Italy, and extends from latitude $35^\\circ 27'$ to latitude $38^\\circ 25'$, and from longitude $12^\\circ 50'$ to longitude $16^\\circ 51'$ east from London. Its greatest length 212 miles, breadth 133, circumference 600; its form triangular, the three angles being the promontories of Pelorium, Pachynum, and Lilybaeum, or as they are now called the Faro, Capo Passaro, and Capo Boso. It is divided from Italy by the straits of Messina, reaching from the Tower of Faro, which is the most northerly part of the island, to the Capo dell' Armi, or the Cape of Arms, the most southern part of Calabria. These straits, by the Latins called Fretum Siculum, by the Italians Il Faro di Messina, and by us the Faro of Messina, are between 12 and 15 miles over in the broadest places, and in the narrowest about a mile and an half; inasmuch that when Messina was taken by the Carthaginians, many of the inhabitants are said to have saved themselves by swimming to the opposite coast of Italy. Hence has arisen an opinion that the island of Sicily was originally joined to the continent, but afterwards separated by an earthquake or some other natural cause. This separation, however, is reckoned by the most judicious among the ancients to be fabulous; and they content themselves with speaking of it as a thing said to have happened.\n\nAnciently this island was called Sicania, Sicilia, and Trinacria or Trigera; the two former it had from the Sicani and Siculi, who peopled a considerable part of Sicily; the country; the two latter from its triangular figure. Its first inhabitants, according to the most respectable ancient authors, were the Cyclopes and Lepriones, who are said to have settled in the countries adjoining to Mount Etna; but of their origin we know nothing, except what is related by the poets. After them came the Sicani, who called themselves the original inhabitants of the country; but several ancient historians inform us that they came from a country in Spain watered by the river Siconus. Diodorus, however, is of opinion, that the Sicani were the most ancient inhabitants of this island. He tells us that they were in possession of the whole, and applied themselves to cultivate and improve the ground in the neighbourhood of Etna, which was the most fruitful part of the island: they built several small towns and villages on the hills to secure themselves against thieves and robbers; and were governed, not by one prince, but each city and district by its own king. Thus they lived till Etna began to throw out flames, and forced them to retire to the western parts of the island, which they continued to inhabit. In the time of Thucydides, some Trojans, after the destruction of their city, landed in the island, settled among the Sicani, and built the cities of Eryx and Egeta, uniting themselves with them, and taking the general name of Elymi or Elymæi. They were afterwards joined by some Phocentes, who settled here on their return from the siege of Troy.\n\nAfter the Sicani had for many ages enjoyed an undisturbed possession of the whole of Sicily, or such parts of it as they chose to inhabit, they were visited by the Siculi, who were the ancient inhabitants of Aulonia properly so called; but being driven out from thence by the Opiæ, they took refuge in the island of Sicily. Not being contented with the narrow bounds allowed them by the Sicani, they began to encroach upon their neighbours; upon which a war ensuing, the Sicani were utterly defeated, and confined to a corner of the island, the name of which was now changed from Sicania into that of Sicilia.\n\nAbout 350 years after the arrival of the Siculi, the island first began to be known to the Greeks, who established various colonies, and built many cities in different parts of the island; and it is only from the time of their arrival that we have any history of the island. The first of the Greeks that came into Sicily were the Chalcidians of Euboea, under the conduct of Thucles, who built Naxus, and a famous altar of Apollo, which, as Thucydides tells us, was still standing in his time without the city. The year after, which was, according to Dionysius Halicarnassensis, the third of the 17th Olympiad, Archias the Corinthian, one of the Heraclidae, laid the foundations of Syracuse. Seven years after, a new colony of Chalcidians founded Leontini and Catana, after having driven out the Siculi, who inhabited that tract. About the same time Lariss, with a colony from Megara, a city of Achaea, settled on the river Pantacius, at a place called Trotilum, where his adventurers lived some time in common with the Chalcidians of Leontini; but, being driven from thence by the Leontines, he built the city of Thapsus, where he died. Upon his death, the colony left Thapsus; and under the conduct of Hyblon king of the Siculi, founded Megara Hyblæa, where they resided 245 years, till they...\nthey were driven out by Gelon tyrant of Syracuse. During their abode at Megara, they sent one Pamius, who was come from Megara in Achaia, their original city, to build Selinus. This city was founded about 100 years after the foundation of Megara. Antiphemus and Entimus, the former a Rhodian, the other a Cretan, led each a colony of their countrymen, and jointly built the city of Gela on a river of the same name, establishing in their new settlement the Doric customs, about 45 years after the founding of Syracuse. The inhabitants of Gela founded Agrigentum 108 years after their arrival in Sicily, and introduced the same customs there. A few years after, Zancle was built by the pirates of Cumae in Italy; but chiefly peopled by the Chalcidians, Samians, and Ionians, who chose rather to seek new settlements than live under the Persian yoke. Some time after, Anaxalces, tyrant of Rhegium, drove out the ancient proprietors; and, dividing his lands amongst his followers, called the city Messana or Megara, which was the name of his native city in Peloponnesus. The city of Himera was founded by the Zancleans under the direction of Eucleides, Simus, and Sacon; but peopled by the Chalcidians and some Syracusan exiles, who had been driven out by the contrary faction.\n\nThe Syracusans built Acrae, Chasmenae, and Camarina; the first 70 years, the second 92, and the third 135, after the foundation of their own city. This is the account which Thucydides, a most judicious and exact writer, gives us of the various nations, whether Greeks or Barbarians, who settled in Sicily. Strabo counts among the ancient inhabitants of Sicily the Morgletes, who being driven out of Italy by the Oenotrians, settled in that part of the island where the ancient city of Morgantium stood. The Campani, who assumed the name of Mamertini, that is, invincible warriors, and the Carthaginians, who settled very early in Sicily, ought likewise to be counted among the ancient inhabitants of the island.\n\nBefore this period the history of Sicily is blended with fables like the early history of almost every other country. After the settlement of the Greeks in the island, its various revolutions have been traced from their several sources by many writers; but by none with greater accuracy than Mr Swinburne. From his account of his Travels in the Two Sicilies, we have therefore taken the following concise history of this kingdom, which will at once gratify such of our readers as interest themselves in the fate of a generous people who long struggled in vain for freedom; and at the same time afford them a specimen of the entertainment they may receive from the very elegant work of the author.\n\n\"Aristocracy prevailed at first in the Greek settlements, but soon made way for tyranny; which in its turn was expelled by democracy. One of the earliest destroyers of common liberty was Phalaris of Agrigentum, who reigned 600 years before Christ; his example was contagious; a legion of tyrants sprung up, and not a commonwealth in the island escaped the lash of an usurper. Syracuse was most oppressed and torn to pieces by diffusion; as its wealth and preponderance in the general scale held out a greater temptation than other cities to the ambition of wicked men. It requires the combined testimony of historians to enforce our belief of its wonderful prosperity, and the no less extraordinary tyranny of some of its sovereigns. The Grecian colonies attained to such excellence in arts and sciences as emboldened them frequently to vie with the learned and ingenious in the mother country; nay, often enabled them to bear away the palm of victory: there needs no stronger proof of their literary merits than a bare recital of the names of Archimedes, Theocritus, Gorgias, and Charondas.\n\n\"But the Sicilian Greeks were not destined to enjoy the sweets of their situation without molestation, nor very soon after their arrival, the inhabitants of the neighbouring coast of Africa began to aspire to a share of Sicily. Carthage sent large bodies of forces at different times to establish their power in the island, and about 500 years before the Christian era had made themselves masters of all the western parts of it. The Siculi retained possession of the midland country, and the southern and eastern coasts were inhabited by the Greeks.\n\n\"About that time Gelo was chosen prince of Syracuse on account of his virtues, which grew still more conspicuous after his exaltation: had the example he set been followed by his successors, the advantages of freedom would never have been known or wished for by the Syracusans. The Carthaginians found in him a vigorous opponent to their project of enslaving Sicily, a project invariably pursued but never accomplished.\n\n\"Hiero succeeded his brother Gelo, and contrary to the usual progression, began his reign by a display of bad qualities. Sensible of his error, and improved by experience, he afterwards adopted more equitable measures. At his death the Syracusans threw off the yoke, and for sixty years revelled in all the joys of freedom. Their peace was, however, disturbed by the Athenians and the Carthaginians. The latter plundered Agrigentum, and threatened ruin to the rest of the Grecian states; but a treaty of peace averted that storm. The Athenians, under pretence of supporting their allies the people of Segesta, but in reality from a thirst of dominion, invested Syracuse with a formidable land and naval armament under the command of Nicias; in consequence of a rash indiscreet plan, ill conducted attacks, and inadequate supplies, their whole host was cut to pieces or led away into captivity.\n\n\"Syracuse had scarcely time to breathe after her victory ere intestine wars broke out, and raised Dionysius the elder to supreme command. Avarice, despotism, and cruelty marked every day of his reign; but his military enterprises were crowned with constant success. He died in peace, and bequeathed a powerful sovereignty to a son of his name tainted with the same worse vices, but not endowed with equal capacity and martial ability: in such hands the rod of tyranny ceased to be formidable, and the tyrant was driven out of Sicily by the patriotic party; but matters were not sufficiently settled for popular government, and Dionysius resumed the sceptre for a while, till Timoleon forced him into perpetual exile.\"\n\nLiberty seemed now to be established on a permanent Agathocles basis; but in Syracuse such prospects always proved ill the tyrant's favor. Agathocles, a tyrant more inhuman than any preceding usurper, seized the throne, and deluged the country with blood. He was involved in a perilous contest with the Carthaginians, who obtained many advantages.\nvantages over him, drove his troops from post to post, and at last blocked up his capital. In this desperate situation, when all foreign helps were precluded, and hardly a resource remained at home, the genius of Agathocles compassed his deliverance by a plan that was imitated among the ancients by Hannibal, and among the moderns by the famous Cortes. He embarked with the flower of his army; forced his way through innumerable obstructions; landed in Africa; and, having burnt his fleet, routed the Carthaginians in a pitched battle, and laid their territory waste. Carthage seemed to be on the brink of ruin, and that hour might have marked her downfall had the Sicilian host been composed of patriotic soldiers, and not of ungovernable afflatus; discord pervaded the victorious camp, murder and riot ensued; and the tyrant, after beholding his children and friends butchered before his face, escaped to Sicily, to meet a death as tragic as his crimes deserved.\n\nAnarchy now raged throughout the island, and every faction was reduced to the necessity of calling in the assistance of foreign powers; among whom Pyrrhus king of Epirus took the lead, and reduced all parties to some degree of order and obedience. But ambition soon prompted him to invade those rights which he came to defend; he called off the walls, and made Sicily feel under his sway as heavy a hand as that of its former oppressors; but the Sicilians soon assumed courage and strength enough to drive him out of the island.\n\nAbout this period the Mamertini, whom Mr Swinburne indignantly styles a crew of miscreants, surpried Messina, and, after a general massacre of the citizens, established a republican form of government. Their commonwealth became so troublesome a neighbour to the Greeks, that Hiero II., who had been raised to the chief command at Syracuse in consideration of his superior wisdom and warlike talents, found himself necessitated to form a league with Carthage, in order to destroy this nest of villains. In their distress the Mamertini implored the assistance of Rome, though the senate had recently punished with exemplary severity one of their own legions for a similar outrage committed at Rhegium. The virtue of the Romans gave way to the temptation, and the desire of extending their empire beyond the limits of Italy, cast a veil over every odious circumstance attending this alliance. A Roman army enrolled the Faro, relieved Messina, defeated the Carthaginians, and humbled Hiero into an ally of the republic.\n\nThus began the first Punic war, which was carried on for many years in Sicily with various success. The genius of Hannibal Barca supported the African cause under numberless disappointments, and the repeated overthrow of his colleagues; at last, finding his exertions ineffectual, he advised the Carthaginian rulers to purchase peace at the price of Sicily. Such a treaty was not likely to be obsevered longer than want of strength should curb the animosity of the vanquished party; when their vigour was recruited, Hannibal son of Hamilcar easily persuaded them to resume the contest, and for 16 years waged war in the heart of the Roman territories. Meanwhile Hiero conducted himself with so much prudence, that he retained the friendship of both parties, and preserved his portion of Sicily in perfect tranquillity. He died in extreme old age, beloved and respected both at home and abroad.\n\nHis grandson Hieronymus, forgetting this happy line of politics, and contracting an alliance with Carthage, fell an early victim to the troubles which his own folly had excited. Once more, and for the last time, the Saracens found themselves in possession of their independence; but the times were no longer suited to such a system; dissensions gained head, and distracted the public councils. Carthage could not support them, or prevent Marcellus from undertaking the siege of Syracuse, immortalized by the mechanical efforts of Archimedes, and the immensity of the plunder. See SYRACUSE.\n\nThe Sicilians after this relinquished all martial ideas, Sicily conquered and during a long series of generations turned their attention solely to the arts of peace and the labours of agriculture. Their position in the centre of the Roman empire preserved them both from civil and foreign by the Normans, except in two instances of a fervile war. The capacity of their governors was a more constant and insupportable evil. In this state of apathy and opulence Sicily remained down to the 7th century of our era, when the Saracens began to disturb its tranquillity. The barbarous nations of the north had before invaded and ravaged its coasts, but had not long kept possession. The Saracens were more fortunate. In 827 they availed themselves of quarrels among the Sicilians to subdue the country. Palermo was chosen for their capital, and the standard of Mahomet triumphed about 200 years. In 1038 George Maniaces was sent by the Greek emperor with a great army to attack Sicily. He made good his landing, and pushed his conquests with vigour; his succeds arose from the valour of some Norman troops, which were at that time unemployed and ready to sell their services to the best bidder. Maniaces repaid them with ingratitude; and by his absurd conduct gave the Musselmans time to breathe, and the Normans pretext and opportunity of invading the Imperial dominions in Italy. Robert and Roger of Hauteville afterwards conquered Sicily on their own account, not as mercenaries; for having substantially settled their power on the continent, they turned their arms against this island in obedience to the dictates of zeal and ambition. After ten years struggle, the Saracens yielded up the rich prize, and Robert ceded it to his brother Roger, who assumed the title of Great Earl of Sicily, ruled the state with wisdom, and ranks deservedly among the greatest characters in history. He raised himself from the humble station of a poor younger son of a private gentleman, to the exalted dignity of a powerful monarch, by the sole force of his own genius and courage; he governed a nation of strangers with vigour and justice, and transmitted his possessions undiminished to his posterity. Such an assemblage of great qualities is well intitled to our admiration.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Simon, whose reign was under the florid, and made way for a second son called Roger. In 1127 this prince joined to his Sicilian possessions the whole inheritance of Robert Guiscard (see NAPLES, March No 23.), and assumed the regal style. The greatest part of his reign was taken up in quelling revolts in Italy, but Sicily enjoyed profound peace. In 1154 his son William ascended the throne, and passed his life in war and confusion. William II. succeeded his father, and died without issue. Tancred, though barely born, was elected his successor, and after him his son William III., who was vanquished by Henry of Swabia. During\nthe troubles that agitated the reign of his son the emperor Frederic, peace appears to have been the lot of Sicily. A short-lived sedition, and a revolt of the Saracens, are the only commotions of which we read. For greater security, the Saracens were removed to Puglia 400 years after the conquest of Sicily by their ancestors. Under Conrad and Manfred Sicily remained quiet; and from that time the history of Sicily is related under the article NAPLES, No 20, &c.\n\nAt the death of Charles II. of Spain, his spoils became an object of furious contention; and at the peace of Utrecht, Sicily was ceded to Victor duke of Savoy, who, not many years after, was forced by the emperor Charles VI. to relinquish that fine island, and take Sardinia as an equivalent. But as the Spaniards had no concern in these bargains, they made a sudden attempt to recover Sicily, in which they failed through the vigilance of the English admiral Byng. He destroyed their fleet in 1718, and compelled them to drop their scheme for a time. In 1734 the Spanish court resumed their design with success. The infant Don Carlos drove the Germans out, and was crowned king of the two Sicilies at Palermo. When he passed into Spain to take possession of that crown, he transferred the Sicilian diadem to his son Ferdinand III. of Sicily, and IV. of Naples, and it has ever since remained in the possession of the same family.\n\nSicily is separated, as we have already observed, from Italy by a narrow strait called the Faro of Messina. This strait is still remarkable for the rapidity of its currents and the irregular ebbing and flowing of the sea, which sometimes rushes in with such violence as to endanger ships riding at anchor. Anciently it was much more remarkable for Scylla and Charybdis, the one a rock, and the other a whirlpool, between which it was very dangerous to steer, and concerning which so many fables have been related by the ancients. Scylla is a rock on the Italian side, opposite to Cape Pylores, which runs out into the sea on the Sicilian side. Mr Brydone informs us, that the navigation of the straits is not even yet performed without danger. He also informs us, that the noise of the current which sets through the straits may be heard for several miles, like the roaring of some large impetuous river confined between narrow banks. In many places the water sets into whirlpools and eddies, which are dangerous to shipping. The current sets exactly for the rock of Scylla, and would certainly have carried any thing thrown into it against that point. Our author, however, is by no means of opinion that the strait is so dangerous as the ancients have represented it; though he thinks that the strait is now probably much wider than formerly, which may have diminished the danger. There are many small rocks, which show their heads near the base of the large ones. These are probably the dogs described by the ancient poets as howling round Scylla. The rock is near 200 feet high, and has a kind of castle or fort built on its summit with a town called Scylla or Sciglio, containing 300 or 400 inhabitants on its south side, which gives the title of prince to a Calabrese family.\n\nThe following account of these rocks and whirlpools is given by the celebrated naturalist Spallanzani. He informs us, that Scylla is a lofty rock, 12 miles from Messina, rising almost perpendicular from the sea on the shore of Calabria, beyond which is the small city of the same name. Though there was scarcely any wind, Spallanzani heard, about two miles distant from the rock, a noise like a confused barking of dogs, and on a nearer approach he discovered the cause. This rock contains a number of caverns, one of the largest of which is called by the people D'agata. The waves, when in the least agitated, rushing into these caverns, break, dash, throw up frothy bubbles, and thus occasion these various and multiplied sounds. He then perceived with how much truth and resemblance of nature Homer and Virgil, in their personifications of Scylla, had portrayed this scene, by describing the monster they drew as lurking in the darkness of a vast cavern, surrounded by ravenous barking mastiffs, together with wolves, to increase the horror.\n\nThough the tide is almost imperceptible in the open parts of the Mediterranean, it is very strong in the strait of Messina, owing to the narrowness of the channel, and regulated by the periodical elevations and depressions of the water. Where the current is accompanied by a wind blowing the same way, vessels have nothing to fear, since they either do not enter the strait, both the wind and stream opposing them; or, if both are favourable, enter on full sail, and pass with such rapidity that they seem to fly over the water. When the current runs from south to north, and the north wind blows hard at the same time, the ship is resisted by the opposite current, and impelled by two forces in contrary directions, is dashed on the rock of Scylla, or driven on the neighbouring sands. The current, where it is strongest, does not extend over the whole strait, but winds through it in intricate meanders, with the course of which the sailors stationed to give strangers assistance are well acquainted, and thus able to guide the ship in such a manner as to avoid it. Should the pilot, however, confiding in his own skill, neglect such assistance, he would run the most imminent risk of being shipwrecked. In this conflict of the waters, it is useless to throw the line to discover the depth of the bottom, the violence of the current frequently carrying the lead almost on the surface of the water. The strongest cables, though some feet in circumference, break like small cords. Every expedient afforded by the art of navigation, is useless here. The only means of avoiding being dashed against the rocks, or driven upon the sands in the midst of this perilous contest of the winds and waves, is to have recourse to the skill and courage of the Messinese seamen.\n\nCharybdis is distant from the shore of Messina about 750 feet, and is called by the people of the country Calofaro, not from the agitation of the waves, but from καλός and φάγεις, beautiful tower, from the lighthouse erected near it for the guidance of vessels. When the current sets in from the north, the pilots call it the descending rema, or current; and when it runs from the south, the ascending rema. The current ascends or descends at the rising or setting of the moon, and continues for six hours. In the interval between each ascent or descent, there is a calm which lasts at least 15 minutes, but not longer than an hour. Afterwards, at the rising or setting of the moon, the current enters from the north, making various angles of incidence with the shore, and at last reaches the Calofaro. This delay sometimes continues\ncontinues two hours; sometimes it immediately falls into the Calofaro; and then experience regards it as a certain indication of bad weather.\n\nWhen Spallanzani observed Charybdis from the shore, it appeared like a group of tumultuous waters, which group as he approached, became more extensive and more agitated. He was carried to the edge, where he flopped some time to make the requisite observations; and was then convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt, that what he saw was by no means a vortex or whirlpool.\n\nThough he was convinced that there was no gulf under the Calofaro, as otherwise there would have been a whirlpool, which would have carried down into it the floating substances; he determined to found the bottom with a plummet, and found its greatest depth did not exceed 500 feet. He was also informed, to his great surprize, that beyond the Calofaro, towards the middle of the strait, the depth was double.\n\nWhen the wind and current are contrary to each other, and both in their greatest violence, the swelling and dashing of the waves within the Calofaro is much stronger, more impetuous, and more extensive. It then contains three or four small whirlpools, or even more, according to the greatness of its extent and violence. If at this time small vessels are driven into the Calofaro by the current or the wind, they are seen to whirl round, rock, and plunge, but are never drawn down into the vortex. They only sink when filled with water, by the waves beating over them. When vessels of a larger size are forced into it, whatever wind they have they cannot extricate themselves; their sails are useless; and after having been for some time tossed about by the waves, if they are not assisted by the pilots of the country, who know how to bring them out of the course of the current, they are furiously driven upon the neighboring shore of the Lattorna, where they are wrecked, and the greater part of their crews perish in the waves.\n\nIf a ship be extricated from the fury of Charybdis, and carried by a strong foisterly wind along the strait towards the northern entrance, it will indeed pass out safely; but should it meet with a wind in a nearly opposite direction, it would become the sport of both these winds, and, unable to advance or recede, be driven in a middle course between their two directions, that is to say, full upon the rock of Scylla, if it be not immediately assisted by the pilots. It is likewise observed, that in these hurricanes a land wind frequently rises, which defends from a narrow pass in Calabria, and increases the force with which the ship is impelled towards the rock. Thus, the saying which became proverbial among the ancients,—that \"he who endeavours to avoid Charybdis, dashes upon Scylla,\" is, in a great measure, true.\n\nIn the straits, Mr Brydone informs us, a most surprising phenomenon is to be observed. In the heat of summer, after the sea and air have been much agitated, there appears in the heavens over the straits a great variety of finger-like forms, some at rest and others moving with great velocity. These forms, in proportion as the light increases, seem to become more aerial, till at last, some time before sunrise, they totally disappear. The Sicilians represent this as the most beautiful sight in nature. Leonti, one of the best Sicilian writers, says, that the heavens appear crowded with a variety of objects, such as palaces, woods, gardens, &c., besides the figures of men and other animals that are seen in motion among them. Some treaties have been written concerning this phenomenon; but nothing satisfactory has been delivered concerning its cause.\n\nThough Sicily lies in a warm climate, the air is healthy, being refreshed with sea breezes on every side, and produces at all times been remarkably fertile; but the era of its greatest prosperity was from the siege of Syracuse by the Athenians to the Carthaginian conquests. Then and long after it supplied with grain, in years of scarcity, all the countries upon the Mediterranean except Egypt and the coasts of Asia, and Rome and Carthage continually. Even now, under all the impediments of superstition and bad government, its productions are, in quantity and quality, the best in Europe. Of the vegetable are grain, wines, oil, fruits, tobacco, mulberry trees for the silkworm, cotton, medicinal roots, and sugar canes. The last of these flourishes near Avola and Merilli. They are of an inferior quality to those of the West Indies, but their sugar is sweeter than any other. The animal production is similar to that of Italy, but the horned cattle are a smaller breed. The coasts abound with fish, particularly with tunney and anchovies; the export of which forms a very lucrative branch of commerce. There are mines of silver, copper, and lead, but none are worked. Near Palma are beds of the best sulphur; at the mouth of the river Giaretta is found a yellow amber, preferable to that of the Baltic; and in every part of the island quarries of marbles, that have furnished materials for all the noble edifices of Sicily. The most beautiful are in the neighbourhood of Palermo, particularly the yellow, and those that resemble the verde antimo, porphyry, and lapis lazuli. The population of the island amounts to 1,300,000 souls; not as much again as the single city of Syracuse formerly contained.\n\nHere are several rivers and good springs; but few of the rivers are navigable, having but a short course, and descending precipitately from the mountains. The chief are the Bantera, the Jaretta, and the Sallo; of which, the two former run from west to east, and the third from north to south.\n\nOf the mountains in this island the most noted is Mount Etna, now called Monte Gibello, or Mongibello, a volcano whose eruptions have often proved fatal to the neighbouring country. See Etna.\n\nWere the Sicilians a cultivated people, among whom constitutional arts were encouraged which not only promote the wealth and comfort of a nation, but also exercise the nobler faculties and extend the views of mankind, the circumstances of their government are such, that it might gradually be improved into a free constitution; but to this, the ignorance, superstition, and poverty, of Sicily, the people seem to be invincible obstacles. The monarchical power in Sicily is far from being absolute; and the parliament claims a share of public authority independently of the will of the king, deduced from a compact made between Roger and the Norman barons after the expulsion of the Saracens. This claim is denied by the king, who wishes the nobles to confer their privileges as derived solely from his favour. Hence the government is in a situation which greatly resembles that of our own and the other kingdoms of Europe in the feudal times; there are continual jealousies and oppositions between the king and the barons, of which an enlightened people might easily take advantage, and obtain that share in the constitution which might secure\nthem from future oppression. In these disputes, the king has the advantage at least of power if not of right; and several works, in which the claims of the Sicilian barons have been affected, were publicly burned not many years ago.\n\nAs the sovereign holds his court at Naples, Sicily is governed by a viceroy, who is appointed only for three years, though at the end of that term his commission is sometimes renewed. He lives in great state, and, as the representative of the king, his power is very considerable. He presides in all the courts and departments of government, and is commander in chief of all the forces: he calls or dissolves the parliament when he pleases; and by him all orders, laws, and sentences, must be signed: but his office is far from being desirable, as it generally renders him the object either of the jealousy of the court of Naples, or of the hatred of the Sicilians.\n\nThe parliament consists of the nobles, the bishops, and abbots, and the representatives of 43 cities, which are immediately subject to the crown. Those cities which are subject to any of the nobles send no members to the parliament; in these the king has not much authority, and derives little advantage from them. According to the laws, the parliament ought to be assembled at the end of every three years: but the government pays little attention to this rule. The common people are in general very much attached to the nobles, and are inclined to take their part in all their differences with the court: but the magistrates and principal inhabitants of the cities which belong to these feudal lords, wish to get rid of their authority, and imagine that they should be less oppressed, if immediately subject to the king: these inclinations are not disagreeable to the court, and are encouraged by most of the lawyers, who are of great service to government in contesting the privileges of the nobles. Many of these privileges are now abridged; and the power of the barons, with respect to the administration of justice in their domains, was very properly limited by the viceroy Caraccioli, in the year 1785. The government of this nobleman was very beneficial to Sicily, as he, in a great measure, cleared the island of the banditti that used to infest it, and made several excellent regulations for the establishment of social order and personal security. He deserves the thanks of every well-wisher to mankind for having abolished the court of inquisition, which had been established in this country by Ferdinand the Catholic, and made dependent on the authority of the grand inquisitor of Spain. Its last auto da fé was held in the year 1724, when two persons were burned. At length Charles III. rendered it independent of the Spanish inquisitor, and abridged its power, by forbidding it to make use of the torture, and to inflict public punishments. The Marchese Squillace, and his successor the Marchese Tanucci, were both enemies to the hierarchy; and, during their viceregalities, took care to appoint sensible and liberal men to the office of inquisitor: the last of whom was Ventimiglia, a man of a most humane and amiable character, who heartily wished for the abolition of this diabolical court, and readily contributed toward it. While he held the office of inquisitor, he always endeavoured to procure the acquittal of the accused; and when he could succeed no other way, would pretend some informality in the trial. The total annihilation of this instrument of the worst of tyranny was referred for Caraccioli. A priest being accused to the inquisition, was dragged out of his house and thrown into the dungeon. He was condemned; but, on account of informality, and a violation of justice in the trial, he appealed to the viceroy, who appointed a committee of jurists to examine the proceedings. The inquisitor refused to acknowledge the authority of this commission; pretending that to expose the secrets of the holy office, and to submit its decisions to the examination of lay judges, would be so inconsistent with his duty, that he would see the inquisition abolished rather than consent to it. Caraccioli took him at his word, and procured a royal mandate by Caraccioli by which the holy office was at once annihilated. He assembled all the nobility, judges, and bishops, on the 27th of March 1782, in the palace of the inquisition, and commanded the king's order to be read; after which he took possession of the archives, and caused all the prisons to be let open: in these were at that time only two prisoners, who had been condemned to perpetual confinement for witchcraft. The papers relating to the finances were preserved; but all the rest were publicly burned. The possessions of the holy office were assigned to the use of churches and charitable institutions; but the officers then belonging to it retained their salaries during their lives. The palace itself is converted into a customhouse, and the place where heretics were formerly roasted alive for the honour of the Catholic faith, is now changed into a public garden. The cognizance of offences against orthodoxy is committed to the bishops; but they cannot cite any one to appear before them without permission from the viceroy; neither can they confine any person to a solitary prison, nor deny him the privilege of writing to his friends, and conversing freely with his advocate. The nobility are so numerous in this island, that Labat says it is paved with noblemen. The general assembly of parliament is composed of 66 archbishops, bishops, abbots, and priors, which form the Braccio ecclesiastico. Fifty-eight princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquises, 27 counts, one viscount, and 79 barons, form the militaire; and the demaniale consists of 43 representatives of free towns. Out of each braccio four deputies are chosen to conduct public business. But the viceroy, the prince of Butera, and the primate of Palermo, are always the three first. Such was the government of Sicily while the Neapolitan monarchy remained entire; but since the latter was usurped by the French, Sicily is all that is left to its former possessor.\n\nSICINIUS DENTATUS, a tribune of the people, lived a little after the expulsion of the kings from Rome. He was in 120 battles and skirmishes, besides single combats, in all of which he came off conqueror. He served under nine generals, all of whom triumphed by his means. In these battles he received 45 wounds in the forepart of his body, and not one in his back. The senate made him great presents, and he was honoured with the name of the Roman Achilles.\n\nSICYOS, a genus of plants belonging to the class of monocotyledons, and to the order of Liliaceae; and in the natural system arranged under the 34th order, Cucurbitaceae.

See Botany Index.\n\nSIDNEY, Sir Philip, was born, as is supposed, at Penshurst in Kent in the year 1554: His father was Sir Henry Sidney, an Irish gentleman, and his mother Mary the eldest daughter of John Dudley duke of Northumberland. He was sent when very young to Christchurch college at Oxford, but left the university at 17 to set out on his travels. After visiting France, Germany, Hungary, and Italy, he returned to England in 1575, and was next year sent by Queen Elizabeth as her ambassador to Randolph emperor of Germany. On his return he visited Don John of Austria, governor of the Netherlands, by whom he was received with great respect. In 1579, when Queen Elizabeth seemed on the point of concluding her long projected marriage with the duke of Anjou, Sir Philip wrote her a letter, in which he dissuaded her from the match with unusual elegance of expression, as well as force of reasoning. About this time a quarrel with the earl of Oxford occasioned his withdrawing from court; during which retirement he is supposed to have written his celebrated romance called Arcadia.\n\nIn 1585, after the queen's treaty with the United States, he was made governor of Flushing and master of the horse. Here he distinguished himself so much both by his courage and conduct, that his reputation rose to the highest pitch. He was named, it is pretended, by the republic of Poland as one of the competitors for that crown, and might even have been elected had it not been for the interference of the queen. But his illustrious career was soon terminated; for in 1586 he was wounded at the battle of Zutphen, and carried to Arnhem, where he soon after died. His body was brought to London, and buried in St Paul's cathedral. He is described by the writers of that age as the most perfect model of an accomplished gentleman that could be formed even by the wanton imagination of poetry or fiction. Virtuous conduct, polite conversation, heroic valour, and elegant erudition, all concurred to render him the ornament and delight of the English court: and as the credit which he enjoyed with the queen and the earl of Leicester was wholly employed in the encouragement of genius and literature, his praises have been transmitted with advantage to posterity. No person was so low as not to become an object of his humanity. After the battle of Zutphen, while he was lying on the field mangled with wounds, a bottle of water was brought him to relieve his thirst; but observing a folder near him in a like miserable condition, he said, This man's necessity is still greater than mine; and resigned to him the bottle of water. Besides his Arcadia, he wrote several smaller pieces both in prose and verse, which have been published.\n\nSidney, Algernon, was the second son of Robert earl of Leicester, and of Dorothy eldest daughter of the earl of Northumberland. He was born about the year 1617. During the civil wars he took part against the king, and distinguished himself as a colonel in the army of the parliament. He was afterwards appointed one of King Charles's judges, but declined appearing in that court. During the usurpation of Cromwell, Sidney, who was a violent republican, retired to the country, and spent his time in writing those discourses on government which have been so deservedly celebrated. After the death of the Protector, he again took part in the public transactions of his country, and was abroad on an embassy to Denmark when King Charles was restored. Upon this he retired to Hamburgh, and afterwards to Frankfort, where he resided till 1677, when he returned to England and obtained from the king a pardon. It has been affirmed, but the story deserves no credit, that during his residence abroad King Charles hired ruffians to assassinate him. After his return he made repeated attempts to procure a seat in parliament, but all of them proved unsuccessful. After the intention of the commons to exclude the duke of York from the throne had been defeated by the sudden dissolution of parliament, Sidney joined with eagerness the councils of Russell, Essex, and Monmouth, who had resolved to oppose the duke's succession by force of arms. Frequent meetings were held at London; while, at the same time, a set of subordinate conspirators, who were not, however, admitted into their confidence, met and embraced the most desperate resolutions. Keeling, one of these men, discovered the whole conspiracy; and Algernon Sidney, together with his noble associates, was immediately thrown into prison, and no art was left unattempted in order to involve them in the guilt of the meaner conspirators.\n\nHoward, an abandoned nobleman, without a single spark of virtue or honour, was the only witness against Sidney; but as the law required two, his discourses on government, found unpublished in his closet, were construed into treason, and declared equivalent to another witness. It was in vain for Sidney to plead that papers were no legal evidence; that it could not be proved they were written by him; and that if they were, they contained nothing treasonable. The defence was overruled; he was declared guilty, condemned, and executed! His attainder was reversed in the first year of King William.\nHe was a man of extraordinary courage; steady even to obstinacy; of a sincere but rough and boisterous temper. Though he professed his belief in the Christian religion, he was an enemy to an established church, and even, according to Burnet, to every kind of public worship. In his principles he was a zealous republican; government was always his favourite study; and his essays on that subject are a proof of the progress which he made.\n\nSIDON, in Ancient Geography, a city of Phoenicia in Asia, famous in Scripture for its riches, arising from the extensive commerce carried on by its inhabitants. Heavy judgements were denounced against the Sidonians on account of their wickedness, which were accomplished in the time of Ochus king of Persia: for that monarch having come against them with an army on account of their rebellion, the city was betrayed by its king; upon which the wretched inhabitants were seized with despair; they set fire to their houses, and 40,000, with their wives and children, perished in the flames.\n\nThis city is now called Saide, and, according to Mr Bruce's account, not only its harbour is filled up with sand, but the pavement of the ancient city flood 7½ feet lower than the ground on which the present city stands. Volney describes it as an ill-built dirty city. Its length along the sea-shore is about 600 paces, and its breadth 150. At the north-west side of the town is the castle, which is built in the sea itself, 80 paces from the main land, to which it is joined by arches. To the west of this castle is a foreshore 15 feet high above the sea, and about 200 paces long. The space between this foreshore and the castle forms the road, but vessels are not safe there in bad weather. The foreshore, which extends along the town, has a basin inclosed by a decayed pier. This was the ancient port; but it is so choked up by sand, that boats alone can enter its mouth near the castle. Yakr-el-din, emir of the Druzes, destroyed all these little ports from Beirut to Acre, by sinking boats and stones to prevent the Turkish ships from entering them. The basin of Saide, if it were emptied, might contain 20 or 25 small vessels. On the side of the sea, the town is absolutely without any wall; and that which encloses it on the land side is no better than a prison-wall. The whole artillery does not exceed six cannons, and these are without carriages and gunners. The garrison scarcely amounts to 100 men. The water comes from the river Aoula, through open canals, from which it is fetched by the women. These canals serve also to water the orchards of mulberry and lemon trees.\n\nSaide is a considerable trading town, and is the chief emporium of Damascus and the interior country. The French, who are the only Europeans to be found there, have a consul, and five or six commercial houses. Their exports consist in silks, and particularly in raw and spun cottons. The manufacture of this cotton is the principal art of the inhabitants, the number of whom may be estimated at about 5000. It is 45 miles west from Damascus. E. Long. 36. S. N.

By most foreign, and even by some British philosophers, it is known by the name of Herschell, in honour of the discoverer. As the other planets are distinguished by marks or characters, the planet Herschell is distinguished by an H, the initial letter of the discoverer's name, and a cross to show that it is a Christian planet. See Astronomy Index.\n\nSIEGE, in the art of war, is to surround a fortified place with an army, and approach it by palliages made in the ground, so as to be covered against the fire of the place.\n\nSIEGEN, a town of Germany in Wetteravia, with a castle and the title of a principality, which it gives to a branch of the house of Nassau. It is seated on a river of the same name, in E. Long. 8. S. N. Lat. 50. 53.\n\nSIENNA, a large, ancient, and celebrated city of Tuscany in Italy; capital of the Sienese, with an archbishop's see, a famous university, and a citadel. It is about four miles in circumference, and surrounded with an old wall. The metropolitan church is much esteemed by travellers; and though it is a Gothic structure, the architecture is admirable. It is built with black and white marble, and the pavement is of mosaic work. The town is adorned with a great number of palaces, fountains, and superb churches, as also a magnificent hospital. The great area is round, and the houses about it are of the same height, supported by piazzas, under which people may walk in hot or rainy weather; in the middle is a basin, which can be filled with water at any time, to represent a sea-fight with small vessels. The Italian language is taught here with such purity, that a great many foreigners frequent it on that account. It is seated on three eminences, in a fertile soil, in E. Long. 11. N. Lat. 43. 10.\n\nSIENNESE, a duchy in Italy; bounded on the north by the Florentine, on the south by the Mediterranean sea and the duchy of Castro, on the east by the Perugino and Orvietano, and on the west by the Florentino and the Tuscan sea; being about 55 miles in length, and as much in breadth. The soil is pretty fertile, especially in mulberry trees, which feed a great number of silk-worms; and there are several mineral springs. Sienna is the capital town.\n\nSIERRA LEONA, a large country on the west coast of Africa, which some extend from the Grain Coast on the south-east to Cape Verga or Vega on the north-west, i.e. between 7° and 18° N. Lat. Others, however, confine the country between Cape Verga and Cape Tagrin. There runs through it a great river of the same name, of which the source is unknown, but the mouth is in longitude 12. 30. west, lat. 8. 5. north, and is nine miles wide. The climate and soil of this tract of country appear to be, on both sides of the river, among the best in Africa, or at least the most favourable to European constitutions. The heat is much the same as that of the West Indies; but on the higher grounds there is a cool sea breeze, and in the mountainous parts the air is very temperate. According to Lieutenant Matthew, \"Sierra Leone, if properly cleared and cultivated, would be equal in salubrity and superior in produce to any of the islands in the West Indies;\" and others have affirmed, that \"the air is better for a man's health than in many places of Europe.\" These advantages of climate induced the English to establish a factory at Sierra Leone; but they chose not the most healthy situation. For the benefit of a spring of good water they fixed their residence in a low valley, which is often overspread with mists and noisome vapours, while the air\nair is clear and serene on the summits of the hills, to which water from the well might be easily carried.\n\nWithin the district occupied by this colony are the Foulahs, who are in general of a tawny complexion, though many of them are entirely black. They lead a wandering life, and roam about the country with large droves of cows, sheep, goats, and horses. They are much praised by travellers for their hospitality; nor is their humanity in other respects less commendable; for, if one of their countrymen have the misfortune to fall into slavery, the rest join stock to redeem him. Elephants are so numerous in the country of the Foulahs, that they are frequently seen in droves of 200 together. The people are very dexterous at hunting them, and other wild beasts; from which they derive their principal articles of trade.\n\nThe animal productions of Sierra Leona are lions, from which it has its name; leopards, hyenas, mink cats, and many kinds of weasels; the japeanee or chimpanzee, a species of simia, which has a still more striking resemblance to the human figure than even the orang outang; porcupines, wild hogs, squirrels, and antelopes. Besides these, which are natives of the country, oxen thrive in it, and even grow fat; asses too are employed in labour, and do not suffer by the climate; but sheep suffer much from the heat, change their wool into hair, grow lean and increase very little; while the hardy goat is here as prolific and large as in any other country. Of the birds which frequent the woods of Sierra Leona we can give no perfect account. A species of crane is mentioned as easily tamed; common poultry multiply fast; ducks thrive well, but geese and turkeys seem not to agree with the climate. Turtles of all kinds are very common, and sometimes of a large size. Crocodiles or alligators of a non-decifit species have been found ten or twelve feet in length, and lizards of six different species. Snakes, which are almost innumerable, haunt the housetops in the night in search of poultry; and one was observed which measured 18 feet, but was happily found not to be venomous. Fishes are in great variety both in the sea and in the rivers. Besides the whale, the shark, flinging ray, and porpoise, there are eels, horle-mackerel, tarponos, cavillos, mullets, snappers, yellow-tails, old-maids, ten-pounders, and some other fishes; all of which, except the eels and ten-pounders, are esteemed fine eating. Oysters are found in great abundance, and another shell-fish, which the natives eat. Among the zoophytes, none is more worthy of notice than the common sponge, which covers all the sandy beaches of the river, particularly on the Bullom shore, and would fetch a high price in Great Britain.\n\nOf the numerous vegetable productions of Sierra Leona, our limits will permit us only to mention the following. Rice, which is the plant chiefly cultivated, as the natives subsist almost entirely upon it, grows both in the high and low grounds. It prospers indeed best in swamps, though the grain is better in a drier soil. Next to rice the cassava constitutes the chief food of the inhabitants, and is cultivated with great care. The country likewise produces yams, various kinds of potatoes, eddoes, or the arum esculentum. Oil-palm, plantains, and bananas; papaw, guava, oranges and limes; pompions, melons, and cucumbers; pine-apples, pigeon-peas, which dressed like English peas are a good pulse; maize or Indian-corn; millet, cocoa-nut trees; cokra; the tallow-tree; a great variety of tamarinds; different kinds of fig-trees and plums; a kind of fruit resembling grapes, but more acid and acrid; cherries resembling a fine nectarine in taste; a species of the bread-fruit tree; the cream fruit, so called because when wounded it yields a fine white juice resembling sugar or the best milk, of which the natives are very fond; the malagueta pepper, or grains of paradise; a new species of nutmeg, but whether so good as the common sort has not yet been ascertained; a new species of the Peruvian bark, which it is hoped will prove as useful as the other; and cola, a fruit highly esteemed by the natives for the same virtues with that bark; the ricinus, casia, dye-fluffs, and gums, of great value; cotton, tobacco, and sugar-canoe, which, it is thought, would thrive exceedingly well under proper cultivation.\n\nConsidering the ardour of the maritime nations of Europe for settling colonies in distant regions of the globe, it is somewhat surprising that a climate so temperate and a soil so productive as that of Sierra Leona did not long ago attract their notice. But it was left to be colonized for a better purpose than that which first drew the natives of Europe to the West Indies and the American continent. Being thinly inhabited, Sierra Leona appeared to some benevolent gentlemen in England a place where, without incommending the natives, a sufficient quantity of ground might be bought on which to settle a great number of free negroes, who in 1766 swarmed in London in idleness and want. About 400 of these wretches, together with 60 whites, mostly women of bad character and in ill health, were accordingly sent out, at the charge of government, to Sierra Leona. Necessity, it was hoped, would make them industrious and orderly; and Captain Thomson of the navy, who conducted them, obtained, for their use, a grant of land to his majesty from King Tom, the neighbouring chief, and afterwards from Naimbanna, the king of the country. The colony, however, soon went to ruin; but the land which they occupied, being about 20 miles square, his majesty was enabled to grant by act of parliament to another colony founded on better principles and for a still nobler purpose.\n\nThe most intelligent members of that society, which laboured so strenuously to procure an abolition of the slave-trade, justly concluding that the natives of Guinea would reap very little benefit from the attainment of their object, unless they should be taught the principles of religion and the arts of civil life, which alone can render them really free, conceived the plan of a colony at Sierra Leona to be settled for the truly generous purpose of civilizing the Africans by maintaining with them a friendly intercourse, and a commerce in every thing but men. This plan could not be carried into effect but at a very great expense. Subscriptions were therefore opened upon rational and equitable terms, and a sum deemed sufficient was speedily raised. An act of parliament was passed in favour of the subscribers, by which they were incorporated by the denomination of the Sierra Leona Company; and in pursuance of that act they held their first meeting at London in October 1791.\n\nThe directors having stated the natural advantages of Sierra Leona, and its present miserable condition, observed, that they had not merely to establish a commercial\nSierra, mercial factory, but that, to introduce civilization, cul-\ntivation, and a safe trade, the company must provide\nfor the security of the persons and property of the co-\nlonists. The directors therefore resolved, that three or\nfour vessels should sail at once, with such a number of\npeople as would be able to protect and assist each other;\nwith goods both for trade and for the supply of the col-\nony. Accordingly several vessels sailed, having on\nboard a council for the government of the colony and\nthe management of the company's affairs; a number of\nartificers and other servants of the company; some sol-\ndiers, and a very few English settlers. The directors\nwere laudably cautious in the choice of colonists. They\nadmitted into the society no white man of bad charac-\nter, or who was not a declared enemy to the slave-trade;\nand as the chief object of their enterprise was the civil-\nization of the natives, it was with great propriety that\nthey chose more than three-fourths of their settlers from\nthe free negroes in Nova Scotia, who had borne arms\nfor the British government during the American war.\nThe superintendent and council were particularly in-\nstructed to secure to all blacks and people of colour, at\nSierra Leona, equal rights and equal treatment, in all\nrespects, with whites. They were to be tried by jury,\nas well as others; and the council was desired to allot to\nthe blacks employments suited to their present abilities,\nand to afford them every opportunity of cultivating their\ntalents. All practicable means of maintaining subordi-\nnation were directed to be used; and the council was\nespecially instructed to promote religion and morals, by\nsupporting public worship and the due observance of\nthe Sabbath, and by the instruction of the people, and\nthe education of children. But no person was to be\nprevented from performing or attending religious wor-\nship in whatever place, time, or manner, he might think\nfit, or from peaceably inculcating his own religious opi-\nnions. Orders were given in choosing the site of a\ntown, to consider health as the first object; and the\nfirst town was directed to be called Free-Town. Arti-\ncles for building and cultivation were sent out, besides\nthe cargoes for prosecuting the company's commerce;\nand schools for reading, writing, and accounts, were\nordered to be set up for the purpose of instructing the\nchildren of such natives as should be willing to put them\nunder the company's care.\n\nThe leading object of the company was to substitute,\nfor that disgraceful traffic which has too long subsisted,\na fair commerce with Africa, and all the blessings which\nmight be expected to attend it. Considerable advan-\ntages appeared hereby likely to result to Great Britain,\nnot only from our obtaining several commodities cheap-\ner, but also for opening a market for British manu-\nfactures, to the increasing demands of which it is diffi-\ncult to assign a limit. From this connection, Africa\nwas likely to derive the still more important benefits of\nreligion, morality, and civilization. To accomplish\nthese purposes, it was necessary for the company to\npossess a tract of land, as a repository for their goods,\nand which the Africans might cultivate in peace, secure\nfrom the ravages of the slave-trade. It had been ascer-\ntained, beyond a doubt, that the climate and soil of\nAfrica were admirably suited to the growth of sugar,\nspices, coffee, cotton, indigo, rice, and every other spe-\ncies of tropical produce. The company proposed to\ninstruct the natives to raise these articles, and to set them\nthe example, by a spirited cultivation, on its own ac-\ncount. Directions were given to the company's com-\nmercial agent to push forward a trade, in a mode pre-\nscribed, in the present produce of Africa. Measures\nwere taken for cultivating, on the company's account,\nthe most profitable tropical produce; and in particular,\na person of long experience in the West Indies was or-\ndered to begin a sugar plantation. A mineralogist and\nbotanist were likewise engaged to go out and explore\nthe country for new articles of commerce.\n\nEverything being thus settled upon the most equita-\nble and benevolent principles, the ships sailed with the\nBritish colonists, to whom, in March 1792, were added\n1131 blacks from Nova Scotia. The native chiefs be-\ning reconciled to the plan, and made to understand its\nbeneficial tendency towards their people, the colony\nproceeded to build Free-Town, on a dry and rather ele-\nvated spot on the south side of the river. It occupied\nbetween 70 and 80 acres, its length being about one-\nthird of a mile, and its breadth nearly the same; and it\ncontained near 400 houses, each having one-twelfth of\nan acre annexed, on which a few vegetables were raised.\nThere were nine streets running from north-west to south-\neast, and three cross streets, all 80 feet wide, except one\nof 160 feet, in the middle of which were all the public\nbuildings. These consisted of a governor's house and\noffices; a large store-house; a large hospital; six or\neight other houses, offices, and shops, occupied by the\ncompany's servants; and a church capable of contain-\ning 800 people. The colonists at first suffered much\nfrom the rainy season, against which it was not in their\npower to provide sufficient protection; but at the end\nof it they recovered in a great measure their health and\nspirits, and proceeded with alacrity to execute the va-\nrious purposes of their settlement. To excite emulation\nin culture, the government gave premiums to those col-\nonists who raised the greatest quantities of rice, yams,\neddoes, cabbages, Indian corn, and cotton, respectively.\nTo limit the excesses of the slave-trade, and gain the\nfavour of the neighbouring chiefs, the directors instruc-\nted the governor and council to redeem any native from\nthe neighbourhood, who should be unjustly sold either\nto or by a British subject. The servants of the compa-\nny conducted themselves with the utmost propriety,\nbeing sober, moral, and exemplary; and from the labours\nof the clergymen were derived services highly important\nin every point of view. Before the end of two years\nfrom the institution of the colony, order and industry\nhad begun to show their effects in an increasing prosp-\nerity. The woods had been cut down to the distance of\nabout three English miles all round the town. By these\nmeans the climate had become healthier, and sicknesses\nhad diminished. The fame of the colony spread not\nonly along the whole western coast of Africa, but also to\nparts far distant from the coast; embassies had been re-\nceived of the most friendly nature from kings and prin-\nces several hundred miles distant; and the native chiefs\nhad begun to send their children to the colony, with\nfull confidence, to be taught reading, writing, and ac-\ncounts, and to be brought up in the Christian religion.\nIn a word, it was not without grounds that the direc-\ntors looked forward to that joyful period when, by the\ninfluence of the company's measures, the continent of\nAfrica should be rescued from her present state of dark-\nness and misery, and exhibit a delightful scene of light\nand knowledge of civilization and order, of peaceful industry and domestic comfort. On their benevolent exertions they hoped with confidence for the blessing of Providence; they were countenanced and supported by the British government; and upon the breaking out of the present war, the French Convention authorized one of their agents to write to the directors, requesting a full account of the design of the institution, and the names of the ships employed in their service, and affording them the good wishes of the French government to no noble undertaking. How completely that government fulfilled its promise is very generally known.\n\nHaving vindicated the rights of man in Europe by the violation of every principle of truth and justice, they determined by the same means to give light and liberty to the Africans; and that they have fully carried their determination into effect will be seen by the following extract of a letter from Mr. Azelius, the company's botanist, dated Sierra Leone, 1st November 1794. \"The French have been here and have ruined us. They arrived on the 28th of September last, early in the morning, with a fleet consisting of one large ship, two frigates, two armed brigs, and one cutter, together with two large armed merchant ships, taken by them at the Isles de Loos, an English slave factory to the north of our colony, and which they have also destroyed and burnt. So well had they concealed their nation, that we took them at first for English. They had English-built vessels, which were rigged in the English way. They showed the English flag, and had their sailors, at least those we saw on deck, dressed like English. In short, we did not perceive our mistake till we observed them pointing their guns. We had not strength sufficient to resist, and therefore our governor gave orders, that as soon as they should begin to fire, the British flag should be struck, and a flag of truce hoisted. Accordingly this was done, but still they continued firing, and did much damage, both within and without the town. They killed all the cattle and animals they found in the fields or streets, yards or elsewhere, not sparing even asses, dogs, and cats. These proceedings they continued the whole succeeding week, till they had entirely ruined our beautiful and prospering colony; and when they found nothing more worth plundering, they set fire to the public buildings and all the houses belonging to the Europeans; and burnt, as they said, by mistake nine or ten houses of the colonists. In the meantime, they were not less active on the water. They sent three of their vessels to Bance Island, an English slave factory higher up the river, which they plundered and burnt, together with some slave ships lying there. They took besides about 10 or 12 prizes, including the company's vessels. Most of these they unloaded and burnt. They took along with them also two of our armed vessels, one of which was a large ship, laden with provisions, and which had been long expected; but she unfortunately arrived a few days too soon, and was taken with her whole cargo. We expected at least to receive our private letters, but even this was refused, and they were thrown overboard. At last, after inflicting on us every hardship we could suffer, only sparing our lives and the houses of the colonists, they sailed on the 13th of October last, at noon, proceeding downwards to the Gold Coast, and left us in the most dreadful situation, without provisions, medicines, clothes, houses, or furniture, &c. &c. and I fear much, that most of us should have perished, had not our friends in the neighbourhood, both natives and Europeans, who were so happy as to escape the enemy, been so kind as to send us what they could spare. In the mean time, most of us have either been, or still are, very sick, and many have died for want of proper food and medicine. The worst, however, is now past. At least we are not in any want of provision, although of the coarsest kind, but are destitute of the most necessary articles and utensils for the house, the table, and the kitchen.\"\n\nIt was thus that the Convention executed their purpose of spreading light and liberty throughout the world. The Sierra Leone colony was established for no other end than to abolish the slave-trade, to enlighten the Africans, and to render them virtuous, rational, free, and happy; and those powerful patrons of the rights of man destroyed that colony with many circumstances of the most wanton cruelty. Though Mr. Azelius is a Swede, and ought therefore to have been protected by the laws of neutrality, they burnt his house with the rest; deprived him of his trunks, his clothes, and his bed; destroyed the natural curiosities which he had collected at the hazard of his life; and carried away the instruments by means of which only he could collect more.\n\nIn 1798, Free-Town, consisted of about 300 houses, and a number of public buildings, together with three wharfs. The government-house, so situated as to command the town and harbour, was protected by a palisade, and six pieces of cannon. The inhabitants of this colony were then computed at 1200, of whom 15 were shopkeepers, 25 fishermen, 10 trading shipmasters, owners of small vessels, 15 seamen, 20 labourers employed by the company, 4 schoolmasters; about one half of the whole population petty farmers, and the rest mechanics. The number of Europeans resident at that time in the colony was\nwas about 30, and nearly 400 free natives wrought as labourers for wages, on the farms in the colony.\n\nA charter of justice was obtained in 1800, to control the turbulence of the blacks from Nova Scotia, and a small military force from Goree was stationed at Sierra Leone. Parliament allowed the company £7000l. for the purpose of erecting a fort, with a promise of £8000l. more for the same undertaking. The company also received £10,000l. for their expense in settling the blacks from Nova Scotia, and a vote of parliament agreed to pay £4000l. for supporting the civil government of the colony.\n\nThe Maroons arrived in Sierra Leone in the month of October 1829, and greatly assisted in suppressing an insurrection of the Nova Scotia blacks, who had attempted to seize on the government of the colony. A body of natives of the Timmanee, headed by two of the fugitive blacks, made an attack on the unfinished fort on the 18th of November, about day-break, but they were repulsed with loss. A truce was concluded; but it was supposed that the Timmanee chiefs would make use of this interval to form alliances with the natives against the British, in order to exterminate them from this part of Africa. Soldiers to the amount of 65 were brought from Goree, and a ship of war was stationed in the river, to defend the settlement.\n\nIn 1802, parliament again voted £10,000l. to the company, for the annual expense of the settlement; and in February 1803, the directors were informed by Lord Hobart, that it would be for the interest of the colony to transfer the civil and military power from the company to the British government.\n\nWhen Captain Hallowell arrived at Sierra Leone on the 12th of January 1803, he found the colony in a wretched condition, reporting to government on his return, that the Maroons were not satisfied with their condition, regarding it as one in which they could not find subsistence; that provisions of every description were both scarce and dear; that its inhabitants lived in hourly danger from the natives; and that the whole colonists lived in a state of despondency. Government, however, was afterwards satisfied, from the explanations of the directors and their servants, that the account of Captain Hallowell was by much too unfavourable. Expectations are indulged that, since the entire abolition of the slave-trade, the colony will soon obtain a flourishing trade with the natives, in the exchange of British manufactures for the raw produce of the interior parts of Africa.\n\nA committee of the house of commons has had a most satisfactory proof of the progressive improvement of the internal administration of the colony, arising from the additional powers conferred on the company by the charter of justice, and the increased vigilance and exertion of the Company's servants. The Maroons have, in a great measure, abandoned some pernicious habits they had long indulged, and by their attachment to the colony, and peaceable demeanour, have merited the approbation of government. The progress made in the erection of works has been considerable, and the colony may be regarded in a state of sufficient security against the attack of any native power. A body of volunteers has been raised within the colony, whose fidelity and attachment have been tried by experience. The sicknesses and mortality which for some time existed, have in a great degree subsided; and there is reason to believe, that it rather originated with the troops when they entered the colony, and their habits of intemperance, than from any disorder connected with their residence in that situation. The number of births, which for some time exceeded that of the deaths in the colony, is a satisfactory proof that it is not unfriendly to population.\n\nSierra Leone is already rendered secure against the only enemies whose hostilities it has immediately to apprehend; its resources are increased; its cultivation reviving; and it is in the possession of every advantage that can arise from the enjoyment of internal tranquillity and order. It is sufficiently manifest, from the inconveniences already experienced in the colony, that during its continuance, it will be essentially necessary to support a local government capable of maintaining order among its inhabitants, and affording them protection. The expense of the civil establishment for some years to come cannot be estimated at less than £10,000l. per annum; that of completing the proposed works has been estimated at £8000l. It also appears that the defence of the colony will require the present volunteer force to be permanently kept up, the expense of which has been estimated at £4000l. per annum; or if so, that establishment should be discontinued, a regular garrison must be maintained at the constant establishment of £17,000l.\n\n100 effective men, exclusive of about 20 artillery men, which, considering the numerous casualties in that climate, and great expense of supporting them, would exceed the sum already mentioned.\n\nSIERRA MORENA, a considerable ridge of mountains of Andalusia in Spain. See SPAIN.\n\nSIEUR, a title of respect among the French, like that of major among us. It is much used by lawyers, as also by superiors in their letters to inferiors.\n\nSIFANTO, or SIPHANTO, an island of the Archipelago, to the west of Paros, to the north-east of Milo, and to the south-west of Serphantos. The air is so good here, that many of the inhabitants live to the age of 120; and their water, fruits, wild fowl, and poultry, are excellent, but more especially the grapes. It abounds with marble and granite, and is one of the most fertile and best cultivated of these islands. The inhabitants employ themselves in cultivating olive-trees and capers; and they have very good silk. They trade in figs, onions, wax, honey, and straw-hats; and may be about 8000 in all. E. Long. 25° 15'. N. Lat. 37° 9'.\n\nSI-FANS, or TOU-FANS, a people inhabiting the Grofer's country on the west of China. Their country is only General a continued ridge of mountains, inclosed by the rivers Hoang-ho on the north, Ya-long on the west, and of China, Yang-tse-kiang on the east, between the 30th and 35th degrees of north latitude.\n\nThe Si-fans are divided into two kinds of people; the one are called by the Chinese Black Si-fans, the other Yellow; names which are given them from the different colours of their tents. The black are the most clownish and wretched; they live in small bodies, and are governed by petty chiefs, who all depend upon a greater.\n\nThe yellow Si-fans are subject to families, the oldest of which becomes a lama, and assumes the yellow dress. These lama princes, who command in their respective districts, have the power of trying causes, and punishing\nSi-fans ing criminals; but their government is by no means burdensome; provided certain honours are paid them, and they receive punctually the dues of the god Fo, which amount to very little, they molest none of their subjects. The greater part of the Si-fans live in tents; but some of them have houses built of earth, and even brick. Their habitations are not contiguous; they form at most but some small hamlets, consisting of five or six families. They feed a great number of flocks, and are in no want of any of the necessaries of life. The principal article of their trade is rhubarb, which their country produces in great abundance. Their horses are small; but they are well shaped, lively and robust.\n\nThese people are of a proud and independent spirit, and acknowledge with reluctance the superiority of the Chinese government, to which they have been subjected: when they are summoned by the mandarins, they rarely appear; but the government, for political reasons, winks at this contempt, and endeavours to keep these intractable subjects under by mildness and moderation: it would, besides, be difficult to employ rigorous means in order to reduce them to perfect obedience; their wild and frightful mountains (the tops of which are always covered with snow, even in the month of July) would afford them places of shelter, from which they could never be driven by force.\n\nThe customs of these mountaineers are totally different from those of the Chinese. It is, for example, an act of great politeness among them to present a white handkerchief of taffeta or linen, when they accost any person whom they are desirous of honouring. All their religion consists in their adoration of the god Fo, to whom they have a singular attachment; their superstitious veneration extends even to his ministers, on whom they have considered it as their duty to confer supreme power and the government of the nation.\n\nSIGAULTIAN operation, a method of delivery in cases of difficult labour, first practised by M.

It is seated in a morass, and has a triple wall, with ditches full of water; and is defended by a citadel, being one of the strongest places in Hungary.

When we read at our fireside the account of an engagement, or other interesting operation of an army, our attention is generally so much engaged by the results, that we give but little to the movements which led to them, and produced them; and we seldom form to ourselves any distinct notion of the conduct of the day. But a professional man, or one accustomed to reflection, and who is not satisfied with the mere indulgence of eager curiosity, follows every regiment in its movements, endeavours to see their connection, and the influence which they have had on the fate of the day, and even to form to himself a general notion of the whole scene of action, at its different interesting periods. He looks with the eye of the general, and sees his orders succeed or fail.\n\nBut few trouble themselves farther about the narration. The movement is ordered; it is performed; and the fortune of the day is determined. Few think how all this is brought about; and when they are told that during the whole of the battle of Cullrin, Frederic the Great was in the upper room of a country inn, from whence he could view the whole field, while his aids de camp, on horseback, waited his orders in the yard below, they are struck with wonder, and can hardly conceive how it can be done; but, on reflection, they feel the possibility of the thing. Their imagination accompanies the messenger from the inn yard to the scene of action; they hear the general's orders delivered, and they expect its execution.\n\nBut when we think for a moment on the situation of the commander of a fleet, confined on board one ship, and this ship as much, or more closely, engaged, than any other of the fleet; and when we reflect that here are no messengers ready to carry his orders to ships of the squadron at the distance of miles from him, and to deliver them with precision and distinctness, and that even if this were possible by sending small ships or boats, the vicissitudes of wind and weather may render the communication so tedious that the favourable moment may be irretrievably lost before the order can be conveyed.—When we think of all these circumstances, our thoughts are bewildered, and we are ready to imagine that a sea battle is nothing but the unconnected struggle of individual ships; and that when the admiral has once \"cried havoc, and let slip the dogs of war,\" he\nhe has done all that his situation empowers him to do, and he must leave the fate of the day to the bravery and skill of his captains and sailors.\n\nYet it is in this situation, apparently the most unfavourable, that the orders of the commander can be conveyed, with a dispatch that is not attainable in the operations of a land army. The scene of action is uninhibited, so that the eye of the general can behold the whole without interruption. The movements which it is possible to execute are few, and they are precise. A few words are sufficient to order them, and then the mere fighting the ships must always be left to their respective commanders. This simplicity in the duty to be performed has enabled us to frame a language fully adequate to the business in hand, by which a correspondence can be kept up as far as the eye can see. This is the language of signals, a language by writing, addressed to the eye, and which he that runneth may read. As in common writing certain arbitrary marks are agreed on to express certain sounds used in speech, or rather, as in hieroglyphics certain arbitrary marks are agreed on to express certain thoughts, or the subjects of these thoughts; so here certain exhibitions are made, which are agreed on to express certain movements to be executed by the commander to whom they are addressed, and all are enjoined to keep their eyes fixed on the ship of the conductor of the fleet, that they may learn his will.\n\nIt is scarcely possible for any number of ships to act in concert, without some such mode of communication between the general and the commanders of private ships. We have no direct information of this circumstance in the naval tactics of the ancient nations, the Greeks and Romans; yet the necessity of the thing is so apparent, that we cannot suppose it to have been omitted by the most ingenious and the most cultivated people who have appeared on the great theatre of the world; and we are persuaded that Themistocles, Conon, and other renowned sea commanders of Athens, had signals by which they directed the movements of their fleets. We read, that when Aegeus sent his son Theseus to Crete, it was agreed on, that if the ship should bring the young prince back in safety, a white flag should be displayed. But those on board, in their joy for reviving their country after their perilous voyage, forgot to hoist the concerted signal. The anxious father was every day expecting the ship which should bring back his darling son, and had gone to the shore to look out for her. He saw her, but without the signal agreed on. On which the old man threw himself into the sea. We find, too, in the history of the Punic wars by Polybius, frequent allusions to such a mode of communication; and Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of the speculatori vexillarii, who were on board the ships in the Adriatic. The coins both of Greece and Rome exhibit both flags and streamers. In short, we cannot doubt of the ancients having practised this hieroglyphical language. It is somewhat surprising that Lord Dudley, in his Arcano del Mare, in which he makes an ostentatious display of his knowledge of every thing connected with the sea service, makes no express mention of this very essential piece of knowledge, although he must, by his long residence in Italy, have known the marine discipline of the Venetians and Genoese, the greatest maritime powers then in Europe.\n\nIn the naval occurrences of modern Europe, mention is frequently made of signals. Indeed, as we have already observed, it seems impossible for a number of ships to act in any kind of concert, without some method of communication. Numberless situations must occur, when it would be impossible to convey orders or information by messengers from one ship to another, and coast and alarm signals had long been practised by every nation. The idea, therefore, was familiar. We find, in particular, that Queen Elizabeth, on occasion of the expedition to Cadiz, ordered her secretaries to draw up instructions, which were to be communicated to the admiral, the general, and the five counsellors of war, and by them to be copied and transmitted to the several ships of the navy, not to be opened till they should arrive in a certain latitude. It was on this occasion (says our historian Guthrie,) \"that we meet with the first regular sets of signals and orders to the commanders of the English fleet.\" But, till the movements of a fleet have attained some sort of uniformity, regulated and connected by some principles of propriety, and agreed on by persons in the habit of directing a number of ships, we may with confidence affirm that signals would be nothing but a parcel of arbitrary marks, appropriated to particular pieces of naval service, such as attacking the enemy, landing the soldiers, &c.; and that they would be considered merely as referring to the final result, but by no means pointing out the mode of execution, or directing the movements which were necessary for performing it.\n\nIt was James II., when duke of York, who first considered this practice as capable of being reduced into a system, and who laid the importance of such a composition. He, as well as the king his brother, had always showed a great predilection for the sea service; and, when appointed admiral of England, he turned his whole attention to its improvement. He had studied the art of war under Turenne, not as a pastime, but as a science, and was a favourite pupil of that most accomplished general. Turenne one day pointed him out, saying, \"Behold one who will be one of the first princes and greatest generals of Europe.\" When admiral of England, he endeavoured to introduce into the maritime service all those principles of concert and arrangement which made a number of individual regiments and squadrons compose a great army. When he commanded in the Dutch war, he found a fleet to be little better than a collection of ships, on board of each of which the commander and his ship's company did their best to annoy the enemy, but with very little dependence on each other, or on the orders of the general: and in the different actions which the English fleet had with the Dutch, every thing was confusion as soon as the battle began. It is remarkable that the famous pensionary De Witt, who from a statesman became a navigator and a great sea commander in a few weeks, made the same representation to the States General on his return from his first campaign.\n\nIn the memoirs of James II., written by himself, we have the following passage: \"1665. On the 15th of March, the duke of York went to Gunfleet, the general rendezvous of the fleet, and hastened their equipment. He ordered all the flag officers on board with him every morning, to agree on the order of battle and rank. In former battles, no order was kept, and this\nunder the duke of York, was the first in which fighting in a line and regular form of battle was observed.\n\nThis must be considered as full authority for giving the duke of York the honour of the invention. For whatever faults may be laid to the charge of this unfortunate prince, his word and honour stand unimpeached. And we are anxious to vindicate his claim to it, because our neighbours the French, as usual, would take the merit of this invention, and of the whole of naval tactics, to themselves. True it is, that Colbert, the great and justly celebrated minister of Louis XIV., created a navy for his ambitious and vain-glorious master, and gave it a constitution which may be a model for other nations to copy. By his encouragement, men of the greatest scientific eminence were engaged to contribute to its improvement; and they gave us the first treatise of naval evolutions. But it must ever be remembered, that our accomplished, though misguided sovereign, was then residing at the court of Louis; that he had formerly acted in concert with the French as a commander and flag officer, and was at this very time aiding them with his knowledge of sea affairs. In the memorable day at La Hague, the gallant Ruffel, observing one of Tourville's movements, exclaimed, \"There! they have got Pepys among them.\" This anecdote we give on the authority of a friend, who heard an old and respectable officer (Admiral Clinton) say, that he had it from a gentleman who was in the action, and heard the words spoken; and we trust that our readers will not be displeased at having this matter of general opinion established on some good grounds.\n\nIt was on this occasion, then, that the duke of York made the movements and evolutions of a fleet the object of his particular study, reduced them to a system, and composed that \"System of Sailing and Fighting Instructions,\" which has ever since been considered as the code of discipline for the British navy, and which has been adopted by our rivals and neighbours as the foundation of their naval tactics. It does great honour to its author, although its merit will not appear very eminent to a careless surveyor, on account of that very simplicity which constitutes its chief excellence. It is unquestionably the result of much sagacious reflection and painful combination of innumerable circumstances, all of which have their influence; and it is remarkable, that although succeeding commanders have improved the subject by several subordinate additions, no change has to this day been made in its general principles or maxims of evolution.\n\nTill some such code be established, it is evident that signals can be nothing but arbitrary and unconnected hieroglyphics, to be learned by rote, and retained by memory, without any exercise of the judgement; and the acquisition of this branch of nautical skill must be a more irksome task than that of learning the Chinese writing. But such a code being once settled, the character in which it may be expressed becomes a matter of rational discussion.\n\nAccordingly, the sailing and fighting instructions of the duke of York were accompanied by a set of signals for directing the chief or most frequent movements of the fleet. These also were contrived with so much judgement, and such attention to distinctness, simplicity, and propriety, that there has hardly been any change found necessary; and they are still retained in the British navy as the usual signals in all cases when we are not anxious to conceal our movements from an enemy.\n\nNotwithstanding this acknowledged merit of the duke of York's signals, it must be admitted that great improvements have been made on this subject, considered art has as an art. The art military has, in the course of a single century past, become almost an appropriate calling, and has therefore been made the peculiar study of its able professors. Our rivals the French were sooner, and improve more formally placed in this situation; and the ministers of Louis XIV. took infinite and most judicious pains to make their military men superior to all others by their academical education. A more scientific turn was given to their education, and the affluence of scientific men was liberally given them; and all the nations of Europe must acknowledge some obligations to them for information on every thing connected with the art of war. They have attended very much to this subject, have greatly improved it, and have even introduced a new principle into the art; and by this means have reduced it to the most simple form of reference to the code of sailing and fighting instructions, by making the signals immediately expressive, not of orders, but of simple numbers. These numbers being prefixed to the various articles of the code of instructions, the officer who sees a signal thrown out by the admiral reads the number, and reports it to his captain, perhaps without knowing to what it relates. Thus simplicity and secrecy, with an unlimited power of variation, are combined. We believe that M. de la Bourdonnais, a brave and intelligent officer, during the war 1758, was the author of this ingenious thought.\n\nWe do not propose to give a system of British signals. This would evidently be improper. But we shall show our readers the practicability of this curious language, the extent to which it may be carried, and the methods which may be practised in accomplishing this purpose. This may make it an object of attention to scientific men, who can improve it; and the young officer will not only be able to read the orders of the commander in chief, but will not be at a loss, should circumstances place him in a situation where he must issue orders to others.\n\nSignals may be divided into,\n\nI. Day Signals.\nII. Night Signals; and,\nIII. Signals in a Fog.\n\nThey must also be distinguished into, 1. Signals of Evolution, addressed to the whole Fleet, or to Squadrons of the fleet, or to Divisions of these squadrons. 2. Signals of Movements to be made by particular ships; and, 3. Signals of Service, which may be either general or particular.\n\nThe great extent of a large fleet, the smoke in time during an engagement, and the situation of the commander in chief, frequently makes it very difficult for the admirals of distant ships to perceive his signals with any distinctness. Frigates, therefore, are stationed out of peart by the line, to windward or to leeward, whose sole office it is to observe the admiral's signals, and instantly to repeat them. The eyes of all the signal officers in the private ships of war are directed to the repeating frigates, as well as to the admiral; and the officers of the repeating frigate, having no other duty, observe the admiral incessantly.\nfantly, and, being unembarrassed by the action, can dis-\nplay the signal with deliberation, so that it may be very\ndifficultly seen. Being minutely acquainted with the\ninstructions which must be made on board the admiral\nwhen his sails and rigging are in disorder, his (perhaps\nimperfect) signal is exhibited by the repeating frigate in\nits proper form, so as to be easily understood. And to\nfacilitate this communication, the commanders of the\ndifferent squadrons repeat the signals of the commander\nin chief, and the commanders of division repeat the sig-\nnals of the commanders of their squadron.\n\nEvery evolution signal is preceded by a signal of AD-\nVERTISMENT and PREPARATION, which is general, and\nfrequently by a gun, to call attention; and when all\nthe signals have been made which direct the different\nparts of that evolution, another signal is made, which\nmarks the close of the complex signal, and divides it\nfrom others which may immediately follow it: and as\nthe orders of the commander in chief may relate either\nto the movements of the whole fleet, those of a single\ndivision, or those of certain private ships, the EXECU-\nTIVE SIGNAL, which dictates the particular move-\nment, is accompanied by a DIRECTIVE SIGNAL, by\nwhich these ships are pointed out, to which the order is\naddressed.\n\nThe commander of the ship to which any signal is\naddressed, is generally required to signify by a signal\n(which is general) that he has observed it. And if\nhe does not thoroughly understand its meaning, he in-\ntimates this by another general signal. And here it is\nto be observed, that as soon as the signal is answered\nby the ships to which it is addressed, it is usual to haul\nit down, to avoid the confusion which might arise from\nothers being hauled in the same place. The order re-\nmains till executed, notwithstanding that the signal is\nhauled down.\n\nIt may happen that the commander who throws out\nthe signal for any piece of service, sees reasons for al-\ntering his plan. He intimates this by a general AN-\nNULLING signal, accompanying the signal already given.\nThis will frequently be more simple than to make the\nsignals for the movements which would be required\nfor re-establishing the ships in their former situa-\ntion.\n\nAll these things are of very easy comprehension, and\nrequire little thought for their contrivance. But when\nwe come to the particular evolutions and movements,\nand to combine these with the circumstances of situation\nin which the fleet may be at the time, it is evident,\nthat much reflection is necessary for framing a body of\nsignals which may be easily exhibited, distinctly per-\nceived, and well understood, with little risk of being mis-\ntaken one for another. We shall take notice of the cir-\ncumstances which chiefly contribute to give them these\nqualities as we proceed in describing their different\nclasses.\n\nI. Of Day Signals.\n\nThese are made by means of the ship's sails, or by\ncolours of various kinds.\n\nThose made with sails are but few in number, and\nare almost necessarily limited to the situation of a fleet\nat anchor. Thus,\n\n| The following Signals | Usually signify |\n|-----------------------|----------------|\n| Main topgallant staysail hoisted | Officers and men belonging to the ship to come on board. |\n| Fore topgallant loose | To prepare for sailing. |\n| Main topgallant loose | To unmoor. |\n| Main topgallant sheets hauled home | To weigh. |\n| Main topgallant sheets clewed up, and the yard hoisted | Annul the former signal, and the ship to come to an anchor. |\n| Topgallant sails loose, and the sheets flying | Discovering strange sails. |\n| Main-topgallant sail loose and hoisted. Topgallant yard down | Recal ships in chafe. |\n| Mizzen topgallant hoisted, and the sheets clewed up | Moor. |\n\nBefore we proceed to the description of the signals by\nmeans of colours, such as FLAGS, BANNERS (or triangu-\nlar flags), PENDANTS or VENES, we must take notice of\nthe ostensible distinctions of the various divisions and\nsubdivisions of a fleet, so that we may understand how\nthe same signal may be addressed to a squadron, divi-\nsion, or single ship or ships. We suppose it known that\na fleet of ships of war is distributed into three grand di-\nvisions (which we shall term squadrons), called the van,\ncentre, and rear. These denominations have not al-\nways a relation to the one being more advanced than the\nother, either towards the enemy, or in the direction of\ntheir course.\n\nIn a land army, the position of every part is concei-\nved from its reference to the enemy; and the reader, of the terms\nconceiving himself as facing the enemy, easily under-\nstands the terms van, centre, and rear, the right and left, the line of\nwing, &c. But the movements of a sea army having little at\na necessary dependence on the wind, they cannot be com-\nprehended unless expressed in a language which keeps\nthis circumstance continually in view. The simplest\nand most easily conceived disposition of a fleet, is that\nin which it is almost indissolubly obliged to form in or-\nder to engage an enemy. This is a straight line, each\nship directly ahead of its neighbour, and close hauled.\nThis is therefore called the line of battle. In this posi-\ntion, the two extremities of the fleet correspond to the\nright and left wings of an army. Suppose this line to\nbe in the direction east and west, the wind blowing\nfrom the north-north-west, and therefore the fleet on the\nstarboard tack; the ships heads are to the west, and the\nweathermost division is undoubtedly the van of the fleet,\nand the weathermost division is the rear. And it is in\nconformity to this arrangement and situation that the\nlist of the fleet is drawn up. But the ships may\nbe on the same east and west line, close hauled, with\ntheir heads to the west, but the wind blowing from the\nsouth-south-west. They must therefore be on the lar-\nboard tack. The same ships, and the same division, are\nstill, in fact, the van of the fleet. But suppose the ships'\nheads to be to the eastward, and that they are close\nhauled,\nNaval Signals.\n\nHauled, having the wind from the south-south-east or north-north-east, the ships which were the real van on both tacks; the former situation are now, in fact, the rear on both tacks; yet they retain the denomination of the van squadron of this fleet, and are under the immediate direction of the officer of the second rank, while the other extremity is under the direction of the third officer. This subdivision therefore is rather an arrangement of rank and precedence than of evolution. It is, however, considered as the natural order to which the general signals must be accommodated. For this reason, the division which is denominated van in the list of this fleet, is generally made to lead the fleet when in the line of battle on the starboard tack, and to form the weathermost column in the order of sailing in columns; and, in general, it occupies that station from which it can most easily pass into the place of the leading division on the starboard line of battle ahead. Although this is a technical nicety of language, and may frequently puzzle a landman in reading an account of naval operations, the reflecting and intelligent reader will see the propriety of retaining this mode of conceiving the subordinate arrangement of a fleet, and will comprehend the employment of the signals which are necessary for re-establishing this arrangement, or directing the movements while another arrangement is retained.\n\nThis being understood, it is easy to contrive various methods of distinguishing every ship by the place which it occupies in the fleet, both with respect to the whole line, with respect to the particular squadron, the particular division of that squadron, and the particular place in that division. This may be done by a combination of the position and colour of the pendants and vanes of each ship. Thus the colour of the pendants may indicate the squadron, their position or mast on which they are hoisted may mark the division of that squadron, and a distinguishing vane may mark the place of the private ship in her own division. The advantages attending this method are many. In a large fleet it would hardly be possible for the commander in chief to find a sufficient variety of single signals to mark the ship to which an order is addressed, by hoisting it along with the signal appropriated to the intended movement. But by this contrivance one-third part of these signals of address is sufficient. It also enables the commander in chief to order a general change of position by a single signal, which otherwise would require several. Thus, suppose that the fore, main, and mizen masts, are appropriated (with the proper modifications) for exhibiting the signals addressed to the van, the centre, and the rear squadrons of the fleet, and that a red, a white, and a blue flag, are chosen for the distinguishing flags of the officers commanding these squadrons; then, if the commander in chief shall hoist a red flag at his mizen top-gallant mast head, it must direct the van squadron to take the position then occupied by the rear squadron, the evolution necessary for accomplishing this end being supposed known by the commander of the squadron, who will immediately make the necessary signals to the squadron under his particular direction. In the same manner, the distinguishing signal for the leading ship of a squadron being hoisted along with the signal of address to the whole fleet, and the signal for any particular force, will cause the three or the nine leading ships to execute that order, &c. &c.\n\nAll that has been said hitherto may be considered as to many preparations for the real issuing of orders by the commander in chief. The most difficult part of the language remains, viz. to invent a number of signals which shall correspond to that almost infinite variety of movements and services which must be performed.\n\nDistinctness, simplicity, and propriety, are the three essential qualities of all signals. A signal must be some object easily seen, strongly marked, so that it may be distinctly understood, with little risk of its being mistaken for another. When made by flags, banners, or pendants, they must be of the fullest colours, and strongest contrasts. The ships are frequently at a very great distance, so that the intervening air occasions a great degradation of colour. They are seen between the eye and a very variable sky; and in this situation, especially in the morning or evening, or a dark day, it is not easy to distinguish one full colour from another, all of them approaching to the appearance of a black. At the distance of a very few miles hardly any full colours can be distinguished but a scarlet and a blue. Red, blue, yellow, and white, are the colours which can be distinguished at greater distances than any others, and are therefore the only colours admitted as signals. Even these are sometimes distinguished with difficulty. A yellow is often confounded with a dirty white, and a blue with a red. All other dark colours are found totally unfit. But as these afford but a small variety, we must combine them in one flag, by making it striped, spotted, or chequered, taking care that the opposition of colour may be as great as possible, and that the pieces of which the flags are made up may not be too minute. Red must never be striped nor spotted with blue; and the stripes, spots, or chequers, should never be less than one-third of the breadth of the flag. Plate CCCCXCVI. is a selection by an officer of experience as a set very easily recognised, and little liable to be confounded. Their colours are represented by hatching, in the same manner as in heraldry (see Heraldry).\n\nDifference of shape, as flags, banners, or pendants, is another distinction by which the expression may be varied. And in doing this, we must recollect, that in light winds it may be difficult to distinguish a flag from a banner, as neither are fully displayed for want of wind to detach the fly from the staff.\n\nAnd lastly, signals may be varied by their position, which may be on any lofty and well detached part of the masts, yards, or rigging.\n\nSimplicity is an eminent property in all signals. They are addressed to persons not much accustomed to combinations, and who are probably much occupied by other pressing duties. It were to be wished that every piece of service could be indicated by a single flag. This is peculiarly desirable with respect to the signals used in time of battle. The rapid succession of events on this occasion call for a multitude of orders from the commander in chief, and his ship is frequently clad over with flags and pendants, so that it is exceedingly difficult for the signal officer of a private ship to distinguish the different groups, each of which make a particular signal.\nThese considerations are the foundation of a certain propriety in signals, which directs us to a choice among marks which appear altogether arbitrary. Signals which run any risk of being confounded, on account of some resemblance, or because their position hinders us from immediately perceiving their difference, should be appropriated to pieces of service which are hardly possible to be executed, or can hardly be wanted, in the same situation. No bad consequence could easily result though the signal for coming to closer action should resemble that for manoeuvring, because the present situation of the ships makes the last operation impossible or absurd. Such considerations direct us to select for battle signals, those which are easiest exhibition, are the most simple, and have the least dependence on the circumstance of position; so that their signification may not be affected by the damages sustained in the masts or rigging of the flag ship. Such signals as are less easily seen at a distance, should be appropriated to orders which can occur only in the middle of the fleet, &c., &c. Signals which are made to the admiral by private ships may be the same with signals of command from the flag ship, which will considerably diminish the number of signals perfectly different from each other.\n\nWith all these attentions and precautions a system of signals is at last made up, fitted to the code of sailing and fighting instructions. It is accompanied by another small list for the duty of convoys. It must be engrossed in two books; one for the officer of the flag ship, who is to make the signals, and the other is delivered to every private ship. In the first, the evolutions, movements, and other operations of service, are set down in one column, and their corresponding signals in another. The first column is arranged, either alphabetically, by the distinguishing phrase, or systematically, according to the arrangement of the sailing and fighting instructions. The officer whose duty it is to make the signals, turns to this column for the order which he is to communicate, and in the other column he finds the appropriated signal.\n\nIn the other book, which is consulted for the interpretation of the signals, they are arranged in the leading column, either by the flags, or by the places of their exhibition. The first is the best method, because the arrangement of the flag ship's masts and rigging in time of action may occasion a change in the place of the signal.\n\nThe Tactique Navale of the Chevalier de Morogues contains a very full and elaborate treatise on signals. We recommend this work to every sea-officer, as full of instruction. The art of signals has been greatly simplified since the publication of this work, but we cannot but admire much of the improvements to it. We believe that the author is the inventor of that systematic manner of addressing the order or effective signal to the different squadrons and divisions of the fleet, by which the art of signals is made more concise, the execution of orders is rendered more systematic, and the commanders of private ships are accustomed to consider themselves as parts of an army, with a mutual dependence and connection. We are ready enough to acknowledge the superiority of the French in manoeuvring, but we affect to consider this as an imputation on their courage. Nothing can be more unjust; and dear-bought experience should long ere now have taught us the value of this superiority.\n\nWhat avails that courage which we would willingly arrogate to ourselves, if we cannot come to action with our enemy, or must do it in a situation in which it is almost impossible to succeed, and which needlessly throws away the lives of our gallant crews? Yet this must happen, if our admirals do not make evolutions their careful study, and our captains do not habituate themselves, from their first holding a pendant, to consider their own ship as connected with the most remote ship in the line. We cannot think that this view of their situation would in the least lessen the character which they have so justly acquired, of fighting their ship with a courage and firmness unequalled by those of any other nation. And we may add, that it is only by such a rational study of their profession, that the gentleman can be distinguished from the mercenary commander of a privateer.\n\nII. Night Signals.\n\nIt is evident, that the communication of orders by night must be more difficult and more imperfect than by day. We must, in general, content ourselves with such orders as are necessary for keeping the fleet together, by directing the more general movements and evolutions which any change of circumstances may render necessary. And here the division and subordinate arrangement of the fleet is of indispensible necessity, it being hardly possible to particularise every ship by a signal of address, or to see her situation. The orders are therefore addressed to the commanders of the different divisions, each of whom is distinguished by his poop and top-lights, and is in the midst of, and not very remote from, the ships under his more particular charge. Yet even in this unfavourable situation, it is frequently necessary to order the movements of particular ships. Actions during the night are not uncommon. Pursuits and rallyings are still oftener carried on at this time. The common dangers of the sea are as frequent and more disastrous. The system of signals therefore is very incomplete till this part be accomplished.\n\nNight signals must be made by guns, or by lights, or by both combined.\n\nGun-signals are susceptible of variety both in number and in disposition. The only distinct variation which can be made in this disposition, is by means of the time elapsed between the discharges. This will easily admit of three varieties, slow, moderate, and quick.—Half-minute guns are as slow as can easily be listened to as pertaining to one signal. Quarter-minute guns are much better, and admit of two very distinct subdivisions. When the gunners, therefore, are well trained to this service (especially since the employment of firelocks for cannon), intervals of 15 or 12 seconds may be taken for slow firing, 8 or 10 seconds for moderate, and 4 or 5 seconds for quick firing. If these could be reduced one half, and made with certainty and precision, the expression would be incomparably more distinct. A very small number of firings varied in this way will give a considerable number of signals. Thus five guns, with the variety of only quick and moderate, will give 20 very distinguishable signals. The same principle must be attended to here as in the flag signals. The most simple must be appropriated to the most important orders, such as occur in the worst weather, or such as are\nmost liable to be mistaken. Quick firing should not make part of a signal to a very distant ship, because the noise of a gun at a great distance is a lengthened sound, and two of them, with a very short interval, are apt to coalesce into one long-continued sound. This mode of varying gun-signals by the time must therefore be employed with great caution, and we must be very certain of the steady performance of the gunners.\n\nNote, that a preparatory signal or advertisement that an effective signal is to be made, is a very necessary circumstance. It is usual (at least in hard weather) to make this by a double discharge, with an interval of half a second, or at most a second.\n\nGun-signals are seldom made alone, except in ordinary situations and moderate weather; because accident may derange them, and inattention may cause them to escape notice, and, once made, they are over, and their repetition would change their meaning. They are also improper on an enemy's coast, or where an enemy's cruisers or fleets may be expected.\n\nSignals by lights are either made with lights simply so called, i.e., lanterns shown in different parts of the ship, or by rockets. Lights may differ by number, and by position, and also by figure. For the flag ship always carrying poop or top-lights, or both, presents an object in the darkest night, so that we can tell whether the additional lights are exhibited about the mainmast, the foremast, the mizzenmast, &c. And if the lights shown from any of these situations are arranged in certain distinguishable situations in respect to each other, the number of signals may be greatly increased. Thus three lights may be in a vertical line, or in a horizontal line, or in a triangle; and the point of this triangle may be up, or down, or forward, or aft, and thus may have many significations.\n\nLights are also exhibited by false fires or rockets: These can be varied by number, and by such differences of appearance as to make them very distinguishable. Rockets may be with stars, with rain fire, or simple squibs.\n\nBy varying and combining these, a very great number of signals may be produced, fully sufficient to direct every general movement or evolution, or any ordinary and important service. The Chevalier de Morogues has given a specimen of such a system of night signals, into which he has even introduced signals of address or direction to every ship of a large fleet; and has also given signals of number, by which depths of soundings, points of the compass, and other things of this kind, may be expressed both easily and distinctly. He has made the signals by rockets perfectly similar in point of number to those by lanterns, so that the commander can take either; a choice which may have its use, because the signals by rockets may cause the presence of a fleet to be more extensively known than may be convenient.\n\nThe commander in chief will inform the fleet by signal, that guns, or perhaps rockets, are not to be used that night. This signal, at the same time, directs the fleet to close the line or columns, that the light signals may be better observed.\n\nIt is indeed a general rule to show as few lights as possible; and the commander frequently puts out his own poop and top-lights, only showing them from time to time, that his ships may keep around him.\n\nThe signal lanterns on board the flag ship, and a Naval lantern kept in readiness on board of every private ship, to answer or acknowledge signals from the commander in chief, are all kept in bags, to conceal their lights till the moment they are fixed in their places, and the preparatory or advertising signal has been made.\n\nThe commander in chief sometimes orders by signal every ship to show a light for a minute or two, that he may judge of the position of the fleet; and the admiral's signal must always be acknowledged by those to whom it is addressed.\n\nIt is of particular importance that the fleet be kept together. Therefore the leading ships of the fleet, on either tack, are enjoined to acknowledge the signals of the commander in chief by a signal peculiar to their station. Thus the commander in chief learns the position of the extremities of his fleet.\n\nIn framing a set of night signals, great attention must be given to their position, that they be not obscured by the sails. The nature of the order to be given will frequently determine this. Thus, an order for the rear ships to make more sail, will naturally direct us to exhibit the signal at the mizen peak; and so of other pieces of service. Lanterns exposed in groups, such as triangles, lozenges, &c. are commonly suspended at the corners of large frames of laths, at the distance of a fathom at least from each other. Attempts have been made to show lights of different colours; but the risk of mistake or failure in the composition at the laboratory, makes this rather hazardous. Coloured lanterns are more certain; but when the glazes are made of a colour sufficiently intense, the vivacity of the light (which at no time is very great) is too much diminished. Besides, the very dilution changes the colour exceedingly and unaccountably.\n\nIII. Of Signals in a Fog.\n\nThese can be made only by noises, such as the firing of cannon and muskets, the beating of drums and ringing of bells, &c. Fog signals are the most difficult to contrive of any, and are susceptible of the least variety. The commander in chief is principally concerned to keep his fleet together; and unless something very urgent requires it, he will make no change in his course or rate of sailing. But a shift of wind or other causes may make this necessary. The changes which he will order, it will be prudent to regulate by some fixed rule, which is in general convenient. Thus, when a fleet is in the order of falling upon a wind, and a fog comes on, the fleet will hold on the same course. If the wind should come a little more on the beam, the fleet will still keep close to the wind. Certain general rules of this kind being agreed on, no signals are necessary for vying certain keeping the fleet together; and the ships can separate or run foul of each other only by difference in their rate of signals failing, or by inaccurate steerage. To prevent this, the ring a fog commander in chief fires a gun from time to time, and are in many the ships of the fleet judge of his situation and distance by the sound. The commanders of divisions fire guns, with some distinction from those of the commander in chief. This both informs the commander in chief of the position of his squadrons, and enables the private ships of each division to keep in the neighbourhood of their own flag ship. On board of every private ship the drum is beaten, or the bell is chimed, every quarter\nquarter of an hour, according as the ship is on the starboard or larboard tack. By such contrivances, it is never difficult to keep a fleet in very good order when sailing on a wind. The wind is almost always moderate, and the ships keep under a very easy sail. It is much more difficult when going large, and separation can be prevented only by the most unrestrained attention. The greatest risk is the falling in with strange ships steering another course.\n\nBut evolutions and other movements are frequently indispensible. The course must be changed by tacking or wearing, and other services must be performed. None, however, are admitted but the most probable, the most simple, and the most necessary.\n\nThe commander in chief first informs the fleet by the preparatory fog signal, that he is about to order an evolution, and that he is to direct it by fog signals. This precaution is indispensible to prevent mistakes. Along with this advertising signal he makes the signal of the movement intended. This not only calls the attention of the fleet, but makes the ships prepare for the precise execution of that movement. The commanders of divisions repeat the advertising signal, which informs their ships of their situation, and the private ships beat their drums or chime their bells. Thus the whole ships of the fleet close a little, and become a little better acquainted with their mutual position. It is now understood that a movement is to be made precisely a quarter of an hour after the advertisement. At the expiration of this time, the effective signal for this movement is made by the commander in chief, and must be instantly repeated by the commanders of divisions, and then the movement must be made by each ship, according to the failing and fighting instructions. This must be done with the utmost attention and precision, because it produces a prodigious change in the relative position of the ships; and even although the good sense of the commander in chief will select such movements for accomplishing his purpose as produce the smallest alterations, and the least risk of separation or running foul of each other; it is still extremely difficult to avoid these misfortunes. To prevent this as much as possible, each ship which has executed the movement, or which has come on a course thwarting that of the fleet, intimates this by a signal properly adapted, often adding the signal of the tack on which it is now standing, and even its particular signal of recognition. This is particularly incumbent on the flag ships and the leading ships of each division.\n\nAfter a reasonable interval, the commander in chief will make proper signals for bringing the fleet to a knowledge of their reunion in this new position.\n\nThis must serve for a general account of the circumstances which must be attended to in framing a code of signals. The arbitrary characters in which the language is written must be left to the sagacity of the gentlemen of the profession. It must be observed, that the stratagems of war make secrecy very necessary. It may be of immense hazard if the enemy should understand our signals. In time of battle it might frequently frustrate our attempts to destroy them, and at all times would enable them to escape, or to throw us into disorder. Every commander of a squadron, therefore, if he uses private signals, suited to his particular definition; and therefore it is necessary that our code of signals be susceptible of endless variations. This is exceedingly easy without any increase of their number. The commander needs only intimate that such and such a signal is so and so changed in its meaning during his command.\n\nWe cannot leave this article without returning to an observation which we made almost in the beginning, viz., that the system of signals, or, to speak more properly, the manner of framing this system, has received much improvement from the gentlemen of the French navy, and particularly from the most ingenious thought of M. de la Bourdonnais, of making the signals the immediate expressions of numbers only, which numbers may be afterwards used to indicate any order whatever. We shall present our readers with a scheme or two of the manner in which this may be done for all signals, both day, night, and fog. This alone may be considered as a system of signals, and is equally applicable to every kind of information at a distance. Without detracting in the smallest degree from the praise due to M. de la Bourdonnais, we must observe, that this principle of notation is of much older date. Bishop Wilkins, in his Secret and Swift Messenger, expressly recommends it, and gives specimens of the manner of execution; so does Dr Hooke in some of his proposals to the Royal Society. Galpar Schottus also mentions it in his Technica Curiosa; and Kircher, among others of his Curious Projects.\n\nM. de la Bourdonnais's method is as follows:\n\nHe chooses pendants for his effective signals, because they are the most easily displayed in the proper order. Several pendants, making part of one signal, may be hoisted by one halyard, being stopped on it at the distance of four or five feet from each other. If it be found proper to throw out another signal at the same time and place, they are separated by a red pendant without a point. His colours are chosen with judgment, being very distinctly recognised, and not liable to be confounded with the addressing signals appropriated to the different ships of the fleet. They are,\n\nFor No. 1. Red. For No. 6. Red, with blue tail.\n2. White. 7. White, with blue tail.\n3. Blue. 8. White, with red tail.\n4. Yellow. 9. Blue, with yellow tail.\n5. Red, with white tail. 10. Yellow, with blue tail.\n\nThree sets of such pendants will express every number under a thousand, by hoisting one above the other, and reckoning the uppermost hundreds, the next below it tens, and the lowest units. Thus the number 643 will be expressed by a pendant red with blue tail, a yellow pendant below it, and a blue one below the last.\n\nThis method has great advantages. The signals may be hoisted in any place where best seen, and therefore the signification is not affected by the derangement of the flag ship's masts and rigging. And by appropriating the smaller numbers to the battle signals, they are more simple, requiring fewer pendants.\n\nAs this method requires a particular set of colours, it has its inconveniences. An admiral is often obliged to shift his flag, even in time of action. He cannot easily take the colours along with him. It is therefore much simpler to make use of such colours as every private ship is provided with. One set of 11 will do, with the addition\ndition of three, at most of four pendants, of singular make, to mark 100, 200, 300, 400. Two of these flags, one above the other, will express any number under 100, by using the 11th as a substitute for any flag that should be repeated. Thus the 11th flag, along with the flag for eight or for six, will express the number 88 or 66, &c. Thus we are able to express every number below 500, and this is sufficient for a very large code of signals.\n\nAnd in order to diminish as much as possible the number of these compound signals, it will be proper that a number of single flag signals be preferred, and even varied by circumstances of position, for orders which are of very frequent occurrence, and which can hardly occur in situations where any obstructions are occasioned by lots of masts, &c. And farther, to avoid all chance of mistake, a particular signal can be added, intimating that the signals now exhibited are numerary signals; or, which is still better, all signals may be considered as numerary signals; and those which we have just now called single flag signals may be set down opposite to, or as expressing, the largest numbers of the code.\n\nThis method requires the signal of advertisement, the annulling signal, the signal of address to the particular ship or division, the signal of acknowledgement, the signal of indistinctness, of distress, of danger, and one or two more which, in every method, must be employed.\n\nAnother method of expressing numbers with fewer colours is as follows: Let the flags be A, B, C, D, E, F, and arrange them as follows:\n\n|   | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12|\n| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18|\n| 19| 20| 21| 22| 23| 24|\n| 25| 26| 27| 28| 29| 30|\n| 31| 32| 33| 34| 35| 36|\n| 37| 38| 39| 40| 41| 42|\n\nThe number expressed by any pair of flags is found in the intersection of the horizontal and perpendicular columns. Thus the flag D, hoisted along with and above the flag F, expresses the number 40, &c. In order to express a greater number (but not exceeding 84) suppose 75, hoist the flags E, which expresses 33, or 75 wanting 42, and above them a flag or signal G, which alone expresses 42.\n\nThis method may be still farther improved by arranging the flags thus:\n\n|   | A | B | C | D | E | F |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |\n| 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12|\n| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18|\n| 19| 20| 21| 22| 23| 24|\n| 25| 26| 27| 28| 29| 30|\n| 31| 32| 33| 34| 35| 36|\n| 37| 38| 39| 40| 41| 42|\n\nIn this last method the signification of the signal is totally independent of the position of the flags. In whatever parts of the ship the flags D and E are seen, they express the number 23. This would suit battle signals.\n\nAnother method still may be taken. Flags hoisted anywhere on the foremast may be accounted units, those on the mainmast tens, and those on the mizzenmast hundreds. Thus numeral signals may be made by a ship dismasted, or having only poles in their place.\n\nMany other ways may be contrived for expressing numbers by colours, and there is great room for exercising the judgement of the contriver. For it must always be remembered, that these signals must be accompanied with a signal by which it is addressed to some particular ship or division of the fleet, and it may be difficult to connect the one with the other, which is perhaps shown in another place, and along with other executive signals.\n\nOne great advantage of these numeral signals is, that they may be changed in their signification at pleasure, of numeral signals. Thus, in the first method, it can be settled, that on Sundays the colours A, B, C, D, &c., express the cyphers, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., but that on Mondays they express the cyphers 5, 6, 7, 8, &c., and so on through all the days of the week. This mean of secrecy is mentioned by Dr Hooke for the coast and alarm signals, where, by the by, he shews a method for conveying intelligence over land very similar to what is now practised by the French with their telegraph.\n\nIt is equally easy to express numbers by night signals. Numbers thus M. de la Bourdonnais proposes, that one may be also charge of a great gun shall express 7, and that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 shall be expressed by lights. Therefore, to express 24, we must fire three guns, and show three lights. This is the most perfect of all forms of night and fog signals. For both the manner of firing guns and of exhibiting lights may be varied to a sufficient extent with very few guns or lights, and with great distinctness.\n\nThus, for guns. Let F mark the firing of a single gun at moderate intervals, and ff a double gun, that is, two discharged at the interval of a second. We may express numbers thus:\n\n- 1: F\n- 2: F, F\n- 3: F, F, F\n- 4: F, F, F, F\n- 5: F, f, f\n- 6: F, F, f, f\n- 7: F, f, f, F\n- 8: F, f, F, F\n- 9: F, f, F, f, f\n- 10: f, f\n- 100, &c.: f, f, f, or f, f, f\n\nIt might be done with fewer guns if the f, f were admitted as the first firing. But it seems better to begin always with the single gun, and thus the double gun beginning a signal distinguishes the tens &c.\n\nIn like manner, a small number of lights will admit of a great variety of very distinct positions, which may serve for all signals to ships not very remote from the commander in chief. For orders to be understood at a very great distance, it will be proper to appropriate the numbers which are indicated by signals made with rockets.\nSIG\n\nNaval Signals. These can be varied in number and kind to a sufficient extent, so as to be very easily distinguished and understood. It is sufficient to have known how the whole, or nearly the whole, notation of signals may be limited to the expression of numbers.\n\nWe have taken little notice of the signals made by private ships to the commander in chief. This is a very easy business, because there is little risk of confusing them with other signals. Nor have we spoken of signals from the flag ships whose ultimate interpretation is number, as when ships are directed to change their course so many points. Those also are easily contrived in any of the methods already described; also when a private ship wishes to inform the commander in chief that soundings are found at so many fathoms. In like manner, by numbering the points of the compass, the admiral can direct to chance to any one of them, or may be informed of strange ships being seen in any quarter, and what is their number.\n\nSignals by the Drum, made use of, in the exercise of the army, instead of the word of command, viz.\n\nSignals.\n\nA short roll, - To caution.\nA flam, - To perform any distinct thing.\nTo arm, - To form the line or battalion.\nThe march, - To advance, except when intended for a salute.\nThe quick march, - To advance quick.\nThe point of war, - To march and charge.\nThe retreat, - To retreat.\nDrum ceasing, - To halt.\nTwo short rolls, - To perform the flank firing.\nThe dragoon march, - To open the battalion.\nThe grenadier march, - To form the column.\nThe troop, - To double divisions.\nThe long roll, - To form the square.\nThe grenadier march, - To reduce the square to the column.\nThe preparative, - To make ready and fire.\nThe general, - To cease firing.\nTwo long rolls, - To bring or lodge the colours.\n\nSignature, a sign or mark impressed upon anything, whether by nature or art. Such is the general signification of the word; but in the plural number it has been used, in a particular sense, to denote those external marks by which physiognomists and other dabblers in the occult sciences pretend to discover the nature and internal qualities of every thing on which they are found. According to Lavater, every corporeal object is characterized by signatures peculiar to itself.\n\nThe doctrine of signatures, like alchemy and astrology, was very prevalent during the 15th and 16th centuries; and was considered as one of the occult sciences which conferred no small degree of honour on their respective professors. Some of these philosophers, as they thought fit to style themselves, maintained that plants, minerals, and animals, but particularly plants, had signatures impressed on them by the hand of nature, indicating to the adept the therapeutic uses to which they might be applied. Others, such as the mystic theosophists and chemists of that day, proceeded much farther in absurdity, maintaining that every substance in nature had either external signatures immediately discernible, or internal signatures, which, when brought into view by fire or menstrua, denoted its connection with some signature-fidereal or celestial archetype. Of the doctrine of signatures, as it relates merely to the therapeutic uses of plants and minerals, traces are to be found in the works of some of the greatest authors of antiquity; but the celestial signatures, we believe, were discovered only by the moonlight of the monkish ages. Pliny informs us, Hist. Nat., that the marble called aphites, from its being spotted like a serpent, was discovered by those spots to be a sovereign remedy for the bite of that animal; and that the colour of the hematites or blood-stone intimated that it was fit to be employed to stop a hemorrhage; but we do not recollect his attributing the virtues of these minerals to a fidereal or celestial influence.\n\nSignature, a signing of a person's name at the bottom of an act or deed written by his own hand.\n\nSignature, in Printing, is a letter put at the bottom of the first page at least, in each sheet, as a direction to the binder in folding, gathering, and collating them. The signatures consist of the capital letters of the alphabet, which change in every sheet; if there be more sheets than letters in the alphabet, to the capital letter is added a small one of the same font, as A a, B b; which are repeated as often as necessary. In large volumes it is easy to distinguish the number of alphabets, after the first three or four, by placing a figure before the signature, as 5 B, 6 B, &c.\n\nSignet, one of the king's seals, made use of in sealing his private letters, and all grants that pass by bill signed under his majesty's hand; it is always in the custody of the secretaries of state.\n\nSignet, in Scots Law. See Law, Part III. § 17.\n\nSilene, Catchfly, or Viscous Campion, a genus of plants belonging to the class decandria, and order trigynia; and in the natural system arranged under the 2nd order, Caryophyllaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nSilesia, a duchy of Germany, bounded on the east by Poland; on the west, by Bohemia and Lower Lusatia; on the south, by a chain of mountains, and a thicket of considerable extent which separates it from Hungary; and to the north, by the marquisate of Brandenburg and Poland. From north-west to south-east it is about 274 miles, and about 100 where broadest: but it is much contracted at both ends. Upon the frontiers of this country, to the west and south, are very high mountains, and some likewise in other parts of it. One of the ridges upon the frontiers is styled the Riphean Mountains, another the Moravian, another the Bohemian, and another the Hungarian, Czapack, or Carpathian. A branch of the Bohemian is called the Giant Mountains. The winter on these hilly tracts is more severe, sets in sooner, and lasts longer, than in the low lands. The inhabitants use a kind of skates when the snow is deep, as they do in Carniola. Little or no grain is raised in the mountains and some sandy tracts; but the rest of the country is abundantly fruitful, not only in grain, but fruits, roots, pasture, flax, hops, madder, tobacco, and hemp, yielding also some wine, with considerable quantities of milk and honey. In many places are great woods of pines, fir, beech, larch, and other trees, affording tar, pitch, rosin, turpentine, lampblack, and timber for all uses. In this country also is found marble of several sorts, some precious stones, limestone, millstone, pitcoal, turf, vitrific, some silver ore, copper, lead, iron, and mineral springs. Great numbers\nbers of black cattle and horses are brought hither from Poland and Hungary for sale, those bred in the country not being sufficient; but of sheep, goats, game, and venison, they have great plenty. As for wild beasts, here are lynxes, foxes, weasels, otters, and beavers. The rivers, lakes, and ponds, yield fish of several sorts, particularly sturgeons several ells in length, and salmon. Besides a number of smaller streams to water this country, there is the Oder, which traverses it almost from one end to the other; and the Vistula, which after a pretty long course through it enters Poland. The number of the cities and market-towns is said to be about 200, the county of Glatz included, and that of the villages 5000. The inhabitants, who are computed to be about 1,821,065 are a mixture of Germans, Poles, and Moravians. The language generally spoken is German; but in some places the vulgar tongue is a dialect of the Slavonic. The estates consist of the princes and dukes, and those called state-lords, with the nobility, who are immediately subject to the sovereign, and the representatives of the chief cities; but since the country fell under the dominion of the king of Prussia, no diets have been held. The king, however, when he took possession of the country, confirmed all the other privileges of the inhabitants.\n\nWith respect to religion, not only Protestants, but Papists, Jews, and Greeks, enjoy full liberty of conscience. The greatest part of Silesia lies in the diocese of Breslau, but some part of it in the Polish dioceses of Posen and Cracow. The bishop of Breslau stands immediately under the pope with regard to spirituals; but all ecclesiastical benefices, not excepting the see of Breslau, is in the king's gift. Besides Latin schools, colleges, and seminaries, at Breslau is an university, and at Legnica an academy for martial exercises. The principal manufactures here are woollens, linens, and cottons of several sorts, with hats, glassware, gunpowder, and iron manufactures. Of these there is a considerable exportation. Accounts are generally kept in rix-dollars, silver groschens, and ducats. With respect to its revolutions and present government, it was long a part of the kingdom of Poland; afterwards it had several dukes and petty princes for its sovereigns, who by degrees became subject to the kings of Bohemia, until at last King Charles IV. incorporated the whole duchy with Bohemia; and thus it continued in the possession of the house of Austria, until the king of Prussia in 1742, taking advantage of the troubles that ensued upon the death of the emperor Charles VI. and pretending a kind of claim, wrested a great part of it, together with the county of Glatz, from his daughter and heiress Maria Theresa, the late empress dowager; so that now only a small part of it is possessed by the house of Austria, and connected with the empire, the rest being governed by the king of Prussia, without acknowledging any sort of dependence on the crown of Bohemia or the empire.\n\nFor the administration of justice in all civil, criminal, and feudal cases, and such as relate to the revenue, the king of Prussia has established three supreme judicatories, to which an appeal lies from all the inferior ones, and from which, when the sum exceeds 300 rix-dollars, causes may be moved to Berlin. The Lutheran churches and schools are under the inspection of the upper consistories, and those of the Papists under that of the bishop's court at Breslau; but from both an appeal lies to the tribunal at Berlin.\n\nAs to the revenue, the excise here is levied only in the walled towns, being on the same footing as in the marquiseate of Brandenburg; but in the rest of the country the contributions are fixed, and the same both in peace and war. The several branches of the revenue are under the management of the war and domain offices of Breslau and Glogau. The whole revenue arising to the king of Prussia from Silesia and the county of Glatz amounts to about four millions of rix-dollars per annum.\n\nSilesia is divided into Upper and Lower, and each of these again into principalities and lordships; of some of which both the property and jurisdiction belong immediately to the sovereign, but of others to his subjects and vassals. In regard to the character of the people, the boors are accounted very dull and stupid; but of those of a higher rank, many have distinguished themselves by their wit and learning, as well as by their military and political talents.\n\nSILESIAN EARTH, in the Materia Medica, a fine astringent body. It is very heavy, of a firm compact texture, and in colour of a brownish yellow. It breaks easily between the fingers, and does not stain the hands; is naturally of a smooth surface, is readily diffusible in water, and melts freely into a butter-like substance in the mouth. It leaves no grittiness between the teeth, and does not ferment with acids. It is found in the perpendicular fissures of rocks near the gold mines in Hungary.\n\nSILICERNIUM, among the Romans, was a feast of a private nature, provided for the dead some time after the funeral. It consisted of beans, lettuces, bread, eggs, &c. These were laid upon the tomb, and they foolishly believed that the dead would come out for the repast. What was left was generally burnt on the stone. The word silicernium is derived from flex and cena, i.e., \"a supper upon a stone.\" Eating what had thus been provided for the dead, was deemed a mark of the most miserable poverty. A similar entertainment was made by the Greeks at the tombs of the deceased; but it was usual among them to treat the ghosts with the fragments from the feast of the living.

See Silica, Chemistry Index.\n\nSILIUS ITALICUS, Catus, an ancient Roman poet, and author of an epic poem in 17 books, which contains an history of the second Punic war, so famous for having decided the empire of the world in favour of the Romans. He was born in the reign of Tiberius, and is supposed to have derived the name of Italicus from the place of his birth; but whether he was born at Italica in Spain, or at Corinium in Italy, which, according to Strabo, had the name of Italica given it during the Social war, is a point which cannot be known; though, if his birth had happened at either of these places, the grammarians would tell us, that he should have been called Italicensis, and not Italicus. When he came to Rome, he applied himself to the bar; and, by a close imitation of Cicero, succeeded so well, that he became a celebrated advocate and most accomplished orator. His merit and character recommended him to the highest offices in the republic, even to the consulship, of which he was possessed when Nero died. He is said to have\nhave been aiding and afflicting in accusing persons of high rank and fortune, whom that wicked emperor had devoted to destruction: but he retrieved his character afterwards by a long and uniform course of virtuous behaviour. Vespasian sent him as proconsul into Asia, where he behaved with clean hands and unblemished reputation. After having thus spent the best part of his life in the service of his country, he bade adieu to public affairs, resolving to consecrate the remainder to polite retirement and the muses. He had several fine villas in the country: one at Tusculum, celebrated for having been Cicero's; and a farm near Naples, said to have been Virgil's, at which was his tomb, which Silius often visited. Thus Martial compliments him on both these accounts:\n\n*Silius hæc magni celebrat monumenta Maronis,\nJugera facundis qui Ciceronis habet.*\nHæredem Dominumque sui tumulique larifoque\nNon alium mallet nec Maro nec Cicero.*\n\nEpigr. 49. lib. xi.\n\nOf Tully's seat my Silius is possest'd,\nAnd his the tomb where Virgil's ashes rest.\nCould those great shades return to choose their heir,\nThe present owner they would both prefer.\n\nIn these retirements he applied himself to poetry: led not so much by any great force of genius, which would certainly not have suffered him to stay till life was in the wane and his imagination growing cold, as by his exceeding great love of Virgil, to whose memory he paid the highest veneration. He has imitated him in his poem; and though he falls infinitely short of him, yet he has discovered a great and universal genius, which would have enabled him to succeed in some degree in whatever he undertook.\n\nHaving been for some time afflicted with an imposthume, which was deemed incurable, he grew weary of life, to which, in the language of Pliny, he put an end with determined courage.\n\nThere have been many editions of Silius Italicus. A neat and correct one was published at Leipzig in 1696, in 8vo, with short and useful notes by Cellarius: but the best is that *cum notis integris variiorum et Arnoldi Drakenborch. Traject. ad Rhen. 1717*, in 4to.\n\nSILK, a very soft, fine, bright thread, the work of an insect called *bombyx*, or the silk worm.\n\nAs the silk worm is a native of China, the culture of silk in ancient times was entirely confined to that country. We are told that the empresses, surrounded by their women, spent their leisure hours in hatching and rearing silk worms, and in weaving tissues and silk veils. That this example was soon imitated by persons of all ranks, we have reason to conclude; for we are informed that the Chinese, who were formerly clothed in skins, in a short time after were draped in vestments of silk. Till the reign of Justinian, the silk worm was unknown beyond the territories of China, but silk was introduced into Peria long before that period. After the conquest of the Persian empire by Alexander the Great, this valuable commodity was brought into Greece, and thence conveyed to Rome. The first of the Roman writers extant by whom silk is mentioned, are Virgil and Horace; but it is probable that neither of them knew from what country it was obtained, nor how it was produced. By some of the ancients it was supposed to be a fine down adhering to the leaves of certain trees or flowers. Others imagined it to be a delicate species of wool or cotton; and even those who had learned that it was the work of an insect, show by their descriptions that they had no distinct idea of the manner in which it was formed. Among the Romans, silk was deemed a drel too expensive and too delicate for men, and was appropriated wholly to women of eminent rank and opulence. Elagabulus is said to have been the first man among the Romans who wore a garment of fine silk: Aurelian complained that a pound of silk was sold at Rome for 12 ounces of gold; and it is said he refused to give his wife permission to wear it on account of its exorbitant price.\n\nFor several centuries the Persians supplied the Roman empire with the silks of China. Caravans traversed the whole latitude of Asia, in 243 days, from the Chinese by the Persian ocean to the sea-coast of Syria, carrying this commodity, fans till the time of Justinian. Sometimes it was conveyed to the ports of Guzerat and Malabar, and thence transported by sea to the Persian gulf. The Persians, with the usual rapacity of monopolists, raised the price of silk to such an exorbitant height, that Justinian, eager not only to obtain a full and certain supply of a commodity which was become so indispensable, but solicitous to deliver the commerce of his subjects from the exactions of his enemies, endeavoured, by means of his ally, the Christian monarch of Abyssinia, to wrest some portion of the silk trade from the Persians. In this attempt he failed; but when he least expected it, he, by an unforeseen event, attained, in some measure, the object which he had in view. Two Persian monks having been employed as missionaries in some of the Christian churches, which were established (as we are informed by Cosmas) in different parts of India, had penetrated into the country of the Seres, or China. There they observed the labours of the silk worm, and became acquainted with all the arts of man in working up its productions into such a variety of elegant fabrics. The prospect of gain, or perhaps an indignant zeal, excited by seeing this lucrative branch of commerce engrifted by unbelieving nations, prompted them to repair to Constantinople. There they explained to the emperor the origin of silk, as well as the various modes of preparing and manufacturing it, mysteries hitherto unknown, or very imperfectly understood in Europe; and encouraged by his liberal promises, they undertook to bring to the capital a sufficient number of those wonderful insects, to whose labours man is so much indebted. This they accomplished, by conveying the eggs of the silk worm in a hollow cane. They were hatched by the heat of a dunghill, fed with the leaves of a wild mulberry tree, and they multiplied and worked in the same manner as in those climates where they first became objects of human attention and care. Vast numbers of these insects were soon reared in different parts of Greece, particularly in the Peloponnesus, Sicily afterwards undertook to breed silk worms with equal success, and was imitated, from time to time, in several towns of Italy. In all these places extensive manufactures were established and carried on with silk of domestic production. The demand for silk from the east diminished of course, the subjects of the Greek emperors were no longer obliged to have recourse to the Persians for a supply of it, and a considerable change took place in...\nSilk in the nature of the commercial intercourse between Europe and India.\n\nAs silk is the production of a worm, it will be first necessary to give a description of its nature and mode of manufacturing. But before we give any account of the most approved methods of managing silk worms in Europe, it will be proper to present a short description of the methods practised in China, the original country of the silk worm. These are two: they either permit them to remain at liberty on mulberry trees, or keep them in rooms. As the finest silk is produced by worms confined in rooms, and as the first method is very simple, it will suffice to describe the second.\n\nTo begin with the eggs, which are laid on large sheets of paper, to which they firmly adhere. The sheets are hung up on a beam of the room, with the eggs inward, and the windows are opened in the front to admit the wind; but no hempen ropes must ever come near the worms or their eggs. After some days the sheets are taken down, rolled up loosely with the eggs inward, and then hung up again, during the summer and autumn. At the end of December, or the beginning of January, the eggs are put into cold water, with a little salt dissolved in it. Two days after they take them out, hang them up again, and when dry roll them a little tighter, and enclose each separately, standing on one end in an earthen vessel. Some put them into a lye made of mulberry tree ashes, and then lay them some moments in snow-water, or else hang them up three nights on a mulberry tree to receive the snow or rain, if not too violent. The time of hatching them is when the leaves of the mulberry trees begin to open, for they are hatched or impeded according to the different degrees of heat or cold to which they are exposed. When they are ready to come forth, the eggs swell, and become a little pointed.\n\nThe third day before they are hatched, the rolls of paper are taken out of the vessel, stretched out, and hung up with their backs toward the sun, till they receive a kindly warmth; and then being rolled up close, they are set upright in a vessel in a warm place. This is repeated the next day, and the eggs change to an ash-gray. They then put two sheets together, and rolling them close tie the ends.\n\nThe third day, towards night, the sheets are unrolled and stretched on a fine mat, when the eggs appear blackish. They then roll three sheets together, and carry them into a pretty warm place, sheltered from the fourth wind. The next day the people taking out the rolls, and opening them, find them full of worms like small black ants.\n\nThe apartment chosen for silk worms is on a dry ground, in a pure air, and free from noise. The rooms are square, and very close, for the sake of warmth; the door faces the south, and is covered with a double mat, to keep out the cold; yet there should be a window on every side, that when it is thought necessary the air may have a free passage. In opening a window to let in a refreshing breeze, care must be taken to keep out the gnats and flies. The room must be furnished with nine or ten rows of frames, about nine inches one above the other. On these they place rush hurdles, upon which the worms are fed till they are ready to spin; and, to preserve a regular heat, stove fires are placed at the corners of the room, or else a warming pan is carried up and down it; but it must not have the least flame or smoke. Cow-dung dried in the sun is esteemed the most proper fuel.\n\nThe worms eat equally day and night. The Chinese give them on the first day forty-eight meals, that is, one every half hour; the next thirty; the third day they have still less. As cloudy and rainy weather takes away their stomach, just before their repast a wisp of very dry straw, the flame of which must be all alike, is held over the worms to free them from the cold and moisture that benumbs them, or else the blinds are taken from the windows to let in the full day-light.\n\nEating so often hastens their growth, on which the chief profit of the silk worm depends. If they come to maturity in 23 or 25 days, a large sheet of paper covered with worms, which at their first coming from the eggs weigh little more than a drachm, will produce 25 ounces of silk; but if not till 28 days, they then yield only 20 ounces; and if they are a month or 40 days in growing, they then produce but ten.\n\nThey are kept extremely clean, and are often removed; and when they are pretty well grown, the worms belonging to one hurdle are divided into three, afterwards they are placed on five, and so on to the number of 20 or more; for being full of humours, they must be kept at a due distance from each other. The critical moment for removing them is when they are of a bright yellow and ready to spin; they must be surrounded with mats at a small distance, which must cover the top of the place to keep off the outward air; and because they love to work in the dark. However, after the third day's labour, the mats are taken away from one o'clock till three, but the rays of the sun must not shine upon them. They are at this time covered with the sheets of paper that were used on the hurdles.\n\nThe cocoons are completed in seven days, after which the worm is metamorphosed into a chrysalis; the cocoons are then gathered, and laid in heaps, having first set apart those designed for propagation upon a hurdle, in a cool airy place. The next care is to kill the moths in those cones which are not to be bored. The best way of doing this is to fill large earthen vessels with cones in layers of ten pounds each, throwing in four ounces of salt with every layer, and covering it with large dry leaves like those of the water-lily, and closely stopping the mouth of the vessels. But in laying the cones into the vessels, they separate the long, white, and glittering ones, which yield a very fine silk, from those that are thick, dark, and of the colour of the skin of an onion, which produce a coarser silk.\n\nThe silk worm is a species of caterpillar, which, like all others of the same class, undergoes a variety of changes, that, to persons who are not acquainted with objects of this kind, will appear to be not a little surprising.\n\nIt is produced from a yellowish-coloured egg, about the size of a small pin-head, which has been laid by a kind of grayish-coloured moth, which the vulgar call No. 72, found with the butterfly.\n\nThese eggs, in the temperature of this climate, if kept beyond the reach of the fire and sunshine, may be preserved during the whole of the winter and spring months without danger of hatching; and even in summer they may easily be prevented from hatching if they be kept in a cool place; but in warmer climates it is scarcely.\nscarcely possible to preserve them from hatching, even for a few days, or from drying so much as to destroy them. Hence it is easy for a native of Britain to keep the eggs till the food on which the worm is to be fed is ready for that purpose. When this food is in perfection, the eggs need only be exposed to the sun for a day or two, when they will be hatched with great facility.\n\nWhen the animal is first protruded from the egg, it is a small black worm, which is active, and naturally ascends to the top of the heap in search of food. At this stage of his growth the silk worm requires to be fed with the youngest and most tender leaves. On these leaves, if good, he will feed very freely for about eight days, during which period he increases in size to about a quarter of an inch in length. He is then attacked with his first sickness, which consists in a kind of lethargic sleep for about three days continuance; during which time he refuses to eat, and changes his skin, preserving the same bulk. This sleep being over, he begins to eat again, during five days, at which term he is grown to the size of full half an inch in length; after which follows a second sickness in every respect like the former.\n\nHe then feeds for other five days; during which time he will have increased to about three quarters of an inch in length, when he is attacked with his third sickness. This being over, he begins to eat again, and continues to do so for five days more, when he is attacked by his fourth sickness, at which time he is arrived at his full growth. When he recovers this sickness, he feeds once more during five days with a most voracious appetite; after which he disdains his food, becomes transparent, a little on the yellowish cast, and leaves his silky traces on the leaves where he passes. These signs denote that he is ready to begin his cocoon, and will eat no more.\n\nThus it appears that the whole duration of the life of the worm, in this state of its existence, in our climate, is usually about 46 days; 28 of which days he takes food, and remains in his sick or torpid state; but it is to be observed, that during warm weather the periods of sickness are shortened, and in cold weather lengthened, above the terms here specified. In very hot climates it may be said to live faster, and sooner to attain maturity, than in those that are colder. Dr Anderson informs us, that at Madras the worm undergoes its whole evolutions in the space of 22 days. It appears, however, that it feeds fully as many days in India as in Europe, the difference being entirely occasioned by shortening the period of sickness. The longest sickness he had seen them experience there did not exceed two days; and during summer it only lasts a few hours.\n\nWhen the worm has attained its full growth, it searches about for a convenient place for forming its cocoon, and mounts upon any branches or twigs that are put in its way for that purpose. After about two days spent in this manner, it settles in its place, and forms the cocoon, by winding the silk which it draws from its bowels round itself into an oblong roundish ball.\n\nDuring this operation it gradually loses the appearance of a worm; its length is much contracted, and its thickness augmented. By the time the web is finished, it is found to be transformed into an oblong roundish ball, covered with a smooth flaky skin, and appears to be perfectly dead. In this state of existence it is called an auridia. Many animals in this state may be often seen sticking on the walls of out-houses, somewhat resembling a small bean.\n\nIn this state it remains for several days entirely motionless in the heart of the cocoon, after which it bursts like an egg hatching, and from that comes forth a heavy dull-looking moth with wings; but the wings it never uses for flying; it only crawls slowly about in the place it has been hatched. This creature forces its way through the silk covering which the worm had woven, goes immediately in quest of its mate, after which the female lays her eggs; and both male and female, without taking food in this stage of their existence, die in a very short time.\n\nThe silk worm, when at its full size, is from an inch and a quarter to an inch and a half in length, and about half an inch in circumference. He is either of a milk or pearl colour, or blackish; these last are esteemed the best. His body is divided into seven rings, to each of which are joined two very short feet. He has a small point like a thorn exactly above the anus. The substance which forms the silk is in his stomach, which is very long, wound up, as it were, upon two spindles, as some say, and surrounded with a gum, commonly yellowish, sometimes white, but seldom greenish. When the worm spins his cocoon, he winds off a thread from each of his spindles, and joins them afterwards by means of two hooks which are placed in his mouth, so that the cocoon is formed of a double thread. Having opened a silk worm, you may take out the spindles, which are folded up in three plaits, and, on stretching them out, and drawing each extremity, you may extend them to near two ells in length. If you then scrape the thread so stretched out with your nail, you scrape off the gum, which is very like bees wax, and performs the same office to the silk it covers as gold leaf does to the ingot of silver it surrounds, when drawn out by the wire drawer. This thread, which is extremely strong and even, is about the thickness of a middling pin.\n\nOf silk worms, as of most other animals, there is a particular considerable variety of breeds, some of which are much attention more hardy, and possess qualities considerably different ought to be from others. This is a particular of much importance paid to the breed of these creatures in any place; for it will make a great difference in the profit on the whole to the undertaker if he rears a good or a bad sort (A). This is a department in respect to the economy of animals that has been in every\n\n(a) As the success of the silk manufacture must depend on the breed of worms, it is of great consequence to bring them from those countries where they are reckoned best.\n\nMr Andrew Wright, an ingenious silk manufacturer of Paisley, has given the following directions for conveying the eggs of the silk worm from distant countries by sea: As soon as the moth has laid her eggs, dry them immediately, and put them into glass phials; seal them to close that damp air or water will not penetrate into them. Put these phials that contain the eggs into earthen pots filled with cold water; and as often as the water becomes warm...\nevery case much less advertised than it deserves; and in particular with regard to the silk worm it has been almost entirely overlooked. A few eggs of the silk worm can be easily transported by post in a letter from any part of Europe to another, especially during the winter season. It would therefore be an easy matter for any patriotic society, such as the Society of Arts in London, to obtain a specimen of the eggs from every country in which silk is now reared, to put these under the care of a person who could be depended upon, and who undertook the management of them, with orders to keep each kind distinct from another, and advert to every particular that occurred in their management, so as to make a fair estimate of their respective merits. By these means the best might be selected, and those of inferior value rejected. Forty or fifty of each sort might be enough for the experiment; but it ought to be repeated several times before conclusions could be drawn from it that might be altogether relied upon; for it is well known that a variation of circumstances will make a change in the result; and it is by no means certain that the same particular would affect those of one breed exactly in the same manner as it would do those of a different breed. One may be more hardy with regard to cold, another more delicate in respect to food, and so on. It is experience alone that can ascertain the circumstances here inquired for.\n\nFrom the above-mentioned particulars, it is evident, that the management of silk worms must be very different in hot climates from what is required in those that are colder. At Madras, it appears from Dr Anderson's experiments that it is very difficult to prevent the eggs from hatching for a very few days, so that many generations of them must be propagated in one year. \"In this hottest season,\" says he, in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, dated July 6, 1791, \"the shortest time I have been able to remark for the whole evolutions of the silk worm is 40 days; that is to say, fix days an egg, 22 a worm, 11 a grub in the cocoon, and one a moth or butterfly.\" Fortunately, where the climate forces forward their production so rapidly, nature hath been equally provident of food for their subsistence; for in these regions the mulberry continues to grow and push out leaves throughout the whole year.\n\nThough the silk worm be a native of China, there is no doubt but it might easily be propagated perhaps in most parts of the temperate zones. The eggs of this insect, indeed, require a considerable degree of warmth to hatch them, but they can also endure a severe frost. No less than 5,400lbs of silk were raised in 1789 in the cold, sandy territories of Prussia. In the province of Pekin, in China, where great quantities of silk are fabricated, the winter is much colder than even in Scotland. From the information of some Ruffians who were sent thither to learn the Chinese language, we find that Reaumur's thermometer was observed from 10 to 15, and even 20 degrees below the freezing point. Nor is it difficult to rear the food of the silk worm in a temperate clime. The mulberry-tree is a hardy vegetable, which bears, without injury, the winters of Sweden, and even of Siberia. Of the seven species of the mulberry (see Morus) enumerated by Linnaeus, four of these (viz. the white, red, black, and Tartarian), there is every reason to believe could be reared both in Britain and Ireland. The white grows in Sweden; the red is abundant round Quebec; the black delights in bleak situations, exposed to wind on the sea shore; and the Tartarian mulberry is represented as growing in the chilly regions of Siberia.\n\nAs to the superior qualities of the different species, whether probably there is very little to be pointed out amongst the four just mentioned with regard to nourishment, except what may be drawn from the following fact: that superior to the first three are laid down together, the silk worm others will first eat the white, then the red, and next the black, in the order of the tenderness of the leaves. The Tartarian seems to hold as high a place in its esteem as either the red or black; but all must yield to the white, which seems to be its natural food.\n\nIn Calabria the red mulberry is used; in Valencia the white; and in Granada, where excellent silk is produced, the mulberries are all black. The white seems to prosper very well in a moist stiff soil; the black agrees well with a dry, sandy, or gravelly soil; and the white is most luxuriant in a moist rich loam.\n\nIt may justly be asserted, that Britain possesses some advantages in the raising of raw silk which are not enjoyed by warmer countries. Even in the fourth of France, Mr Arthur Young informs us, the mulberry leaves are often nipped by frosts in the bud; but this is for raising scarcely ever the case with us. It is well known that silk is most hurtful to the silk worm. Now our climate can boast that it is almost wholly exempted from those dreadful storms of thunder and lightning which prevail so much in hot climates. Nature has then furnished us with everything requisite for the silk manufacture; it remains only for us to improve the advantages which we possess. Let mulberry trees be planted by proprietors of lands, and let a few persons of skill and attention devote their time to the raising of silk worms. This is an employment that will not interfere with any manufacture already established; on the contrary, it would afford a respectable, a lucrative, and agreeable employment to ladies, or to females in general, who have at present too few professions to which they can apply. The society instituted at London for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce, much to their honour, have offered premiums to those who shall plant a certain number of mulberry trees.\n\nThe following method of raising mulberry trees from seed is practised in the south of France, and has been repeated with success in the East Indies by Dr Anderson, in the province of Madras. \"Take the ripe berries of the mulberry when it is full of juice and of seeds. Next take a piece of rough horse-hair line or rope, such as we dry linen on, and with a good handful of ripe mulberries run your hand along the line bruising the berries and mashing them.\"\n\nwarm renew it. Place the earthen vessels in the coldest place of the ship, and let them remain until the end of the voyage. It must be observed, that the ship chosen for this purpose ought to be one that would arrive in Britain in the months of June or July.\nthem as much as possible as your hand runs along, so that the pulp and seeds of the berries may adhere in great abundance to the rope or hair line. Next dig a trench in the ground where you wish to plant them, much like what is practiced in kitchen gardens in England for crops of various kinds. Next cut the rope or hair line into lengths according to the length of the trench you think fit to make, and plunge the line full of mashed berries into the trench, and then cover it over well with earth, always remembering afterwards to water it well, which is essential to the success. The seeds of the berries thus sown will grow, and soon shoot out young suckers, which will bear young leaves, which are the best food for the silk worm.\n\n\"The facility and rapidity with which young leaves may by this means be produced is evident, for as many rows of trenches may thus be filled as can be wished; and it can never be necessary to have mulberry trees higher than our raspberries, currants, or gooseberry bushes. Whenever they get beyond that, they lose their value; and if these trenches succeed, you may have a supply coming fresh up day after day, or any quantity you please.\" Thus abundance of these trees might be reared. But as mulberry trees are not yet found in abundance in this country, it were to be wished that some other food could be substituted in their place: attempts have accordingly been made by those who have reared silk worms, and it has been found possible to support the silk worm upon lettuce (n).\n\nMiss Henrietta Rhodes, a lady who has made some successful experiments on raising silk worms in England, had found that the silk worm could with safety be kept on lettuce for some time. This is pretty generally known by ladies who have turned their attention to this subject; but she found that in general they could not with safety be kept upon that food above three weeks. If longer fed upon that plant, the worms for the most part die without spinning a web at all. She found, however, that they did not always die, but that in some cases they produced very good cocoons, even when fed entirely on lettuce. She therefore with reason suspected that the death of the animal must be occasioned by some extraneous circumstance, and not from the poisonous quality of the food itself; the circumstance she suspected, from some incidental observations, was the coldness of that food; and therefore she thought it was not impossible, but if they were kept in a very warm place, while fed on lettuce, they might attain, in all cases, a due perfection.\n\nGeneral Mordaunt having been informed of this conjecture, resolved to try the experiment. He got some silk worms eggs, had them hatched in his hot-house, and caused them to be all fed upon lettuce and nothing else. They prospered as well as any worms could do, few or none of them died; and they afforded as fine cocoons as if they had been fed upon mulberry leaves. As far as one experiment can go, this affords a very exhilarating prospect in many points of view. If one kind of food has been noxious, merely on account of an improper temperature, others may be found which have been hurtful only from a similar cause; so that it is not impossible but we may at last find that this delicate creature may be supported by a variety of kinds of food. Few, however, could be more easily obtained than lettuce; and this plant, when cabbaged (the cos, or ice lettuce especially), would possess one quality that the mulberry leaf never can possess, from the want of which many millions of worms die in those countries where silk is now reared; for it is observed, that when the leaves are gathered wet, it is scarcely possible to preserve the worms alive for any length of time; so that during a continuance of rainy weather many of them are unavoidably cut off; but a lettuce, when cabbaged, refills moisture. If gathered, even during rain, the heart of it is dry; so that if the outer leaves be thrown aside at that time, the worms would be continued in perfect health. The expense, too, of cultivating and gathering lettuce, would be so much less than that of gathering mulberry leaves, as to occasion a saving that would be much more than sufficient to counterbalance the expense of heating the conservatory, as a little reflection will show.\n\nBut the great point to be now ascertained is, whether it is a fact that worms fed on lettuce, kept in a due temperature, will continue in good health, in general, till they shall have perfected their cocoon? One experiment is too little to establish this fact with perfect certainty. It would therefore be necessary that more experiments should be made on this subject.\n\nIt is said that Dr Lodovico Bellardi, a learned and ingenious botanist of Turin, has, after a number of experiments, discovered a new method of feeding silk worms, when they are hatched before the mulberry leaves have produced leaves, or when it happens that the frost destroys the tender branches. This new method consists in giving the worms dried leaves of the mulberry-tree. One would think that this dry nourishment would not be much relished by these insects; but repeated experiments made by our author, prove that they prefer it to any other, and eat it with the greatest avidity. The mulberry leaves must be gathered about the end of autumn, before the frosts commence, in dry weather, and at times when the heat is greatest. They must be dried afterwards in the sun, by spreading them upon large cloths, and laid up in a dry place after they have been reduced to powder. When it is necessary to give this powder to the worms, it should be gently moistened with a little water, and a thin coat of it must be placed around the young worms, which will immediately begin to feed upon it.\n\nWe have mentioned all the different kinds of food, proper which, as far as we have heard, have been tried with experiments any success to nourish the silk worm; not, however, ought to be made on with great confidence, but as experiments which it might vary, we be worth while carefully to consider and perform. We must not omit to mention that one person, who has had much\n\n(b) It is not improbable, says Dr Anderson, to whose valuable work entitled the Bee, we have been much indebted in the drawing up of this article, that other kinds of food may be found which will answer the same purpose. The chicorium intybus and common endive might be tried, as they have the same lactescent quality with the lettuce.\nmuch experience in the managing of silk worms, afflures us, that the silk produced from any other food than mulberry leaves is of an inferior quality, and that the worms are fickle. We think, however, that there is reason to suspect that the experiment has not been skillfully performed; and therefore, before every other food except mulberry leaves is discarded, the experiment ought to be performed with more attention and care. We know that many animals in a domestic state can live upon food very different from that which supported them when running wild in the fields. Certain it is, however, that every animal, in its state of nature, partakes of a food peculiar to itself, which is rejected by other animals as if it were of a poisonous quality; and it may be mentioned as a curious fact, as well as an admirable instance of the care of that Being who feeds the fowls of heaven, that notwithstanding the numberless insects that prey upon animals and vegetables, the mulberry tree is left untouched by them all, as the exclusive property of the silk worm, the chief of the insect tribe, which toils and spins for the use of man.\n\nHaving now considered the food proper for the silk worm, we shall next consider what situation is most favourable to them. In the opinion of some persons in this country who have been in the practice of rearing silk worms, they ought always to be kept in a dry place, well sheltered, and possessing a considerable degree of warmth, and which is not exposed to sudden transitions from heat to cold. If the weather be too cold, a small fire must be made; this is of most importance when the worms are ready for spinning. A southern exposure is therefore preferable. Some think light is of great utility to silk worms, others think that they thrive better in the dark. As to what apartments are best accommodated for promoting the health of silk worms, and most convenient for those who have the care of them, they may be various according to the extent of the manufacture or the wealth of the proprietors. Silk worms may be kept in boxes or in shelves. When shelves are to be used, they may be constructed in the following manner: The shelves may be of wicker, ranged at the distance of a foot and a half, and fixed in the middle of the room: their breadth ought to be such, that any person can easily reach to the middle from either side. This is perhaps the simplest and cheapest apparatus for rearing silk worms; but there is another apparatus which may be recommended to those who are anxious to unite some degree of elegance with convenience. This apparatus is the invention of the Rev. George Swayne of Puckle-church, a gentleman who has studied this subject much, in order to find out the way for promoting the culture of silk among the poor. This apparatus, with the description of it, may be found in the Transactions of the Society for encouraging Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, vol. vii. p. 148. The apparatus consists of a wooden frame four feet two inches high, each side ten inches and a half wide, divided into eight partitions by small pieces of wood which form grooves, into which the slides run, and are thus easily thrust into or drawn out of the frame. The upper slide in the model sent to the society by Mr. Swayne is of paper only, and designed to receive the worms as soon as hatched; the two next are of catgut, the threads about one-tenth of an inch distant from each other: these are for the insects when a little advanced in size; the five lower ones are of wicker work; but, as Mr. Swayne afterwards found, netting may be substituted with advantage instead of wicker bottoms. Under each of these, as well as under those of catgut, are sliders made of paper, to prevent the dung of the worms from falling on those feeding below them.\n\nThe management of silk worms is next to be attended to. The proper time for hatching them is when the leaves of the mulberry are full grown, or nearly so; that as soon as these insects are capable of receiving food they may obtain it in abundance. To attempt to hatch them sooner would be hurtful, as the weather would not be sufficiently warm. Besides, as leaves are necessary to the life of a vegetable, if the young leaves of the mulberry tree are cropped as soon as they are unfolded, the tree will be so much weakened as to be incapable of producing so many leaves as it would otherwise have done; and if this practice be frequently repeated, it will inevitably be destroyed.\n\nWhen the proper season is arrived, the eggs may be hatched either by the heat of the sun, when it happens to be strong enough, or by placing them in a small hatched room moderately heated by a stove or fire; and after being exposed for six or seven days to a gentle heat, the silk worm issues from the egg in the form of a small black hairy caterpillar. When Mr. Swayne's apparatus is used, the worms are to be kept on the drawers with paper bottoms till they are grown so large as not readily to creep through the gauze-bottomed drawers; they are then to be placed on those drawers, where they are to remain till their excrements are so large as not readily to fall through; when this is the case, they must be removed to the drawers with the wicker or netting bottoms, and fed therein, till they show symptoms of being about to spin. It is scarcely necessary to mention, that the paper slides beneath the gauze and wicker drawers are intended to receive the dung, which should be emptied as often as the worms are fed, at least once a day; or to direct, that when the worms are fed, the slides are to be first drawn out a considerable way, and the drawers to rest upon them.\n\nIt has been already mentioned, that wet or damp food is exceedingly prejudicial to those insects. It produces contagious and fatal diseases. To prevent the production of contagious diseases, attention ought to be paid to the weather, so that when there is an immediate prospect of rain, a sufficient quantity of leaves may be gathered to serve the worms two or three days. In this country, the leaves of the black or red mulberry tree may be preferred good for food, although kept four or five days, by the following method: When new gathered, lay them loosely in glazed earthen vessels, place these in a cool place, well aired, not exposed to drought.\n\nThe utmost attention must be paid to preserve the place where silk worms are kept as clean as possible: the house or room must be well ventilated, that no noxious vapours be accumulated. By some experiments of M. Faujas de St Fond, which are recorded in his history of Languedoc, it appears that the silk worm is much injured by foul air. All decayed leaves must be removed from them, as it is now well known that they emit bad air in great abundance.\n\nOne of the most difficult branches of the management of silk worms has hitherto been the cleaning without bruising.\nbruising them. To avoid this inconvenience, the peasants in France and Italy frequently allow the whole litter to remain without ever cleaning them, which is often the cause of that unwholesome stench that has been so often remarked by those who visit the places for rearing silk worms in these countries. This difficulty may be effectually removed by providing a net, or, what would be still better, a wire-bottomed frame, wrought into large meshes like a riddle. Have that made of a size exactly sufficient to cover the wooden box in which the worms are kept. When you mean to shift them, spread fresh leaves into the wire basket; and let it down gently over the worms till it comes within their reach. They no sooner perceive the fresh food than they abandon the rubbish below, and creep through the meshes, so as to fix themselves upon the leaves; then by gently raising the fresh basket, and drawing out the board below (which ought to be made to flip out like the flip-bottom of a bird's cage), you get off all the excrements and decayed leaves, without incommending the worms in the smallest degree; and along with the litter you will draw off an inch or two in depth of the foulest mephitic vapours. To get entirely rid of these, the board, when thus taken out, should be carried without doors, and there cleaned; and the flip-board immediately replaced to receive all the excrements and offals. After it is replaced, the wire frame that had been elevated a little, may be allowed to descend to a convenient distance above the board without touching it. Thus will there be left a vacant space for the mephitic air to fall below the worms, so as to allow them to inhabit a wholesome region of the atmosphere.\n\nWhen a fresh supply of food is to be given before cleaning, the wire frame ought to be let down as close to the board as can be safely done, and another wire-bottomed frame put over it, with fresh leaves, as before described. When the worms have abandoned that in their turn, let the flip-board, together with the lower wire frame, be drawn out and removed, and so on as often as necessary. To admit of this alternate change, every table, consisting of one flip-board, ought to have two sets of wire-bottomed frames of the same size; the flip-board to be always put into its place immediately after it is cleaned, and the wire frames reserved to be afterwards placed over the other. By this mode of management, it is probable that the worms would be saved from the diseases engendered by the mephitic air, and the numerous deaths that are the consequence of it avoided.\n\nDr Anderson, to whom we have already acknowledged our obligations, and to whom this country has been so much indebted for valuable works on agriculture, the fisheries, &c., advises those who have the management of silk worms to spread a thin stratum of fresh flaked quicklime upon the flip-board each time it is cleaned, them immediately before it is put into its place. This would absorb the mephitic gas, for as soon as it is generated it would descend upon the surface of the quicklime. Thus would the worms be kept continually in an atmosphere of pure air (c). Were the walls of the apartments to be frequently washed with quicklime and water, it would tend much to promote cleanliness at a small expense, and augment the healthiness of the worms as well as that of the persons who attend them.\n\nWhen the silk worm refuses its food, and leaves silky Mr traces on the leaves over which it passes, it is a proof Swayne's that it is ready to begin its cocoon. It is now necella receptacle ry to form a new receptacle, which is commonly done by pinning together papers in the shape of inverted cones, when go- with broad bases. \"This method (says Mr Swayne), ing to spin. where there are many worms, is exceedingly tedious, Transfa- wastes much paper, and uses a large number of pins; tions of the besides, as the silk worm always weaves an outer cover. Society for oval ball, I apprehended that it caused a needleless wafté the Exami- of silk in forming the broad web at the top. The me-vill. p. 123. nement method I make use of is, to roll a small piece of paper (an uncut octavo leaf, such as that of an old magazine, is sufficient for three), round my fore-finger, and to give it a twist at the bottom; which is done with the utmost expedition, and gives no occasion for the use of pins. These rolled paper-cakes being likewise of a form more nearly resembling that of a cocoon, with a much narrower opening on the top than the others, takes away the necessity of wasting much silk in the outer web, and consequently leaves more to be employed in forming the ball. The silk is readily taken out of these cakes by untwisting the bottom; and if this be done with moderate care, and the papers are preserved, they will serve several times for the like purpose.\"\n\nOthers advise, that when the silk worms are preparing Others re- to spin, little bushes of heath, broom, or twigs, should commend be bushes of heath.\n\n(c) To put this question beyond a doubt, Mr Blancard made the following comparative experiments, which were several times repeated. \"I procured (says he) four glass jars nine inches high and five in diameter, clogging the mouth with cork stoppers. After which I placed in each of them, in their second life (for mule may be translated, which means the stage between the different sicknesses), twelve silk worms, which were fed four times a day; and which I confined in this kind of prison all their life, without taking away either their dead companions or their ordure or litter. I sprinkled with chalk the worms of only two of these jars, and kept the two others to compare with them.\n\n\"In those without lime, I never obtained either more or less than three small and imperfect cocoons (chiques ou bouffard), and in the two that were sprinkled with lime, I had very often twelve, and never less than nine fine full-sized firm cocoons.\"\n\nThis experiment affords the most satisfactory proof of the utility of this process. From a number of trials he found, that even when the worms were covered with a large proportion of lime, they never were in any way in-\nbe stuck upright near the shelf or box in which they are inclosed: the worms mount these, and attach their web to them.\n\nWhen the worms are ready to mount, in order to keep them in a languishing condition; your care must then be to revive them, which is effected thus: Take a few eggs and onions, and fry them in a pan with some stale hog's lard, the ranker the better, and make pancake; which done, carry it smoking hot into the room where they are kept, and go round the chamber with it. You will be surprised to see how the finell revives them, excites those to eat who have not done feeding, and makes the others that are ready to spin climb up the twigs.\n\nIn about ten or twelve days, according to the accounts which we have received from Mr Andrew Wright of Pailey, it may be safely concluded, that if the worms have finished their work, the cocoons may be collected.\n\nWe shall now distinguish the cocoons from one another according to their value or their use, and consider the method of managing each. They may be distinguished into the good and bad. The good cocoons may be known by these marks: they are little, strong, and firm; have a fine grain, both ends are round, and they are free from spots. Among the good cocoons also may be arranged those which are called calcined cocoons, in which the worm, in consequence of sickness, is petrified or reduced to a fine powder. These cocoons produce more silk than others, and are sold in Piedmont at half as much again. They may be distinguished by the noise which the worm makes when the cocoon is shaken. Of the bad cocoons there are six species: 1. The pointed cocoons, one extremity of which ends in a point; the silk which covers the point is weak, and soon breaks or tears. 2. The cocoons, which are bigger, but the contexture is weak. 3. The dupsions, or double cocoons, which have been formed by the joint labour of two and sometimes of three worms. 4. The fouflons, which have a loose contexture, sometimes so loose that they are transparent. 5. The perforated cocoons, which have a hole at one end. 6. The bad cloquette, which is composed of defective cocoons, spotted or rotten. Besides these there is the good cloquette, which does not properly belong to either of these two classes: it is formed of those cocoons in which the worm dies before the silk is brought to perfection. The worms adhere to one side of the cocoon, and therefore when the cocoon is shaken will not rattle: the silk is as fine, but is not of so bright a colour, nor is so strong and nervous, as that which is obtained from good cocoons.\n\nThe cocoons which are kept for breeding are called royal cocoons. For selecting and preserving these, we have been favoured with some valuable instructions by Mr Wright of Pailey, which we shall present to our ing the roy-readers.—The largest and best cocoons ought to be kept for breed, about an equal number of males and females; the cocoons that contain the former are sharper pointed at the ends than those that contain the latter. Although it should happen that there are more females than males, little inconvenience or ill consequences can arise from it, as one male will serve two or three females, if the time of their coming out of the cocoons allow. About 12 or 15 days after they begin to spin, the cocoons for breed may be laid on sheets of white paper; about this time the moth opens for itself a passage through the end of its cocoon, and issues out. When the female has laid her eggs, which on an average may amount to 250, they are spread upon sheets of paper and hung up to dry in some place where they may not be exposed to the heat of the sun: after being dried they must be kept in a cool well-aired place, where neither vapours nor moisture can reach them. That they may be preserved from external accidents, as insects of different kinds will destroy them, and mice is their enemy in all the stages of their existence, they should be kept in stone pots or glass bottles with their mouths stoppered, and there remain until brought out next season to be hatched.\n\nThe cocoons from which the silk is to be immediately wound must be exposed to the heat of an oven, in order to kill the chrysalis or aurelia, which would otherwise eat its way through the cocoon, and render it useless. The following directions are given for managing this process by one of the first silk manufacturers in Italy.\n\nPut your cocoons in long shallow baskets, and fill them within an inch of the top. You then cover them up with paper, and put a wrapper over that. These baskets are to be disposed in an oven, whose heat is as near as can be that of an oven from which the bread is just drawn after being baked. When your cocoons have remained therein near an hour, you must draw them out; and to see whether all the worms are dead, draw out a dupion from the middle of your basket and open it: if the worm be dead, you may conclude all the rest are so; because the contexture of the dupion being stronger than that of the other cocoons, it is consequently less easy to be penetrated by the heat. You must observe to take it from the middle of the basket, because in that part the heat is least perceptible. After you have drawn your baskets from the oven, you must first cover each of them with a woollen blanket or rug, leaving the wrapper besides, and then you pile them above one another. If your baking has succeeded, your woollen cover will be all over wet with a kind of dew, the thickness of your little finger. If there be less, it is a sign your cocoons have been too much or too little baked. If too much baked, the worm, being over-dried, cannot transpire a humour he no longer contains, and your cocoon is then burnt. If not enough baked, the worm has not been sufficiently penetrated by the heat to distil the liquor he contains, and in that case is not dead.\n\nYou must let your baskets stand thus covered five or six hours if possible, in order to keep in the heat, as this makes an end of stifling those worms which might have avoided the first impression of the fire. You are likewise to take great care to let your cocoons stand in the oven the time that is necessary; for if they do not stand long enough, your worms are only stunned for a time and will afterwards be revived. If, on the other hand, you leave them too long in the oven, you burn them: many infirmities of these two cases are frequently to be met with. It is a good sign when you see some of the butterflies spring out from the cocoons which have been baked, because you may be certain they are not burnt. For if you would kill them till to the last worm, you would burn many cocoons which might be more exposed to the heat than that particular worm.\n\nThe next operation is the winding of the silk. Before\nfore you begin to wind, you must prepare your cocoons as follows:\n\n1. In stripping them of that waste silk that surrounds them, and which served to fasten them to the twig. This burr is proper to stuff quilts, or other such uses; you may likewise spin it to make stockings, but they will be coarse and ordinary.\n\n2. You must sort your cocoons, separating them into different classes in order to wind them apart. These classes are, the good white cocoons; the good cocoons of all the other colours; the dupions; the cocalons, among which are included the weak cocoons; the good choquette; and, lastly, the bad choquette.\n\nIn sorting the cocoons, you will always find some perforated cocoons amongst them, whose worm is already born; those you must set apart for fleuret. You will likewise find some soufflins, but very few; for which reason you may put them among the bad choquette, and they run up into waste.\n\nThe good cocoons, as well white as yellow, are the easiest to wind; those which require the greatest care and pains are the cocalons; you must wind them in cooler water than the others, and if you take care to give them to a good winditer, you will have as good silk from them as the rest. You must likewise have careful winditers for the dupions and choquettes. These two species require hotter water than the common cocoons.\n\nThe good cocoons are to be wound in the following manner: First, choose an open convenient place for your filature, the longer the better, if you intend to have many furnaces and coppers. The building should be high and open on one side, and walled on the other, as well to screen you from the cold winds and receive the sun, as to give a free passage to the steam of your basins or coppers.\n\nThese coppers or basins are to be disposed (when the building will admit of it) in a row on each side of the filature, as being the most convenient method of placing them, for by that means in walking up and down you see what every one is about. And these basins should be two and two together, with a chimney between every couple.\n\nHaving prepared your reels (which are turned by hands, and require a quick eye), and your fire being a light one under every basin, your winditer must stay till the water is as hot as it can be without boiling. When everything is ready, you throw into your basins two or three handfuls of cocoons, which you gently brush over with a wisk about six inches long, cut flumply like a broom worn out: by these means the threads of the cocoons stick to the wisk. You must disengage these threads from the wisk, and purge them by drawing their ends with your fingers till they come off entirely clean. This operation is called la Battue.\n\nWhen the threads are quite clear, you must pass four of them (if you will wind fine silk) through each of the holes in a thin iron bar that is placed horizontally at the edge of your basin; afterwards you twist the two ends (which consist of four cocoons each) twenty or twenty-five times, that the four ends in each thread may the better join together in crossing each other, and that your silk may be plump, which otherwise would be flat.\n\nYour winditer must always have a bowl of cold water by her, to dip her fingers in, and to sprinkle very often the said bar, that the heat may not burn the thread.\n\nYour threads, when thus twisted, go upon two iron hooks called rampins, which are placed higher, and from thence they go upon the reel. At one end of the axis of the reel is a cog-wheel, which catching in the teeth of the post ram, moves it from the right to the left, and consequently the thread that is upon it; so that your silk is wound on the reel crossways, and your threads form two banks of about four fingers broad.\n\nAs often as the cocoons you wind are done, or break or diminish only, you must join fresh ones to keep up the number requisite, or the proportion; because, as the cocoons wind off, the thread being finer, you must join two cocoons half wound to replace a new one: Thus you may wind three new ones and two half wound, and your silk is from four to five cocoons.\n\nWhen you would join a fresh thread, you must lay one end on your finger, which you throw lightly on the other threads that are winding, and it joins them immediately, and continues to go up with the reel. You must not wind off your cocoons too bare or to the last, because when they are near at an end, the boirre, that is, the bulk, joins in with the other threads, and makes the silk foul and gouty.\n\nWhen you have finished your first parcel, you must clean your basins, taking out all the striped worms, as well as the cocoons, on which there is a little silk; which you first open and take out the worm, and then throw them into a basket by you, into which you likewise cast the loose silk that comes off in making the battue.\n\nYou then proceed as before with other two or three handfuls of cocoons; you make a new battue; you purge them, and continue to wind the same number of cocoons or their equivalent, and so to the end.\n\nAs was already mentioned, the winditer must always have a bowl of cold water by her, to sprinkle the bar, to cool her fingers every time she dips them in the hot water, and to pour into her basin when necessary, that is, when her water begins to boil. You must be very careful to twist your threads a sufficient number of times, about 25; otherwise your silk remains flat, instead of being round and full; besides, when the silk is not well crofted, it never can be clean, because a gout or nub that comes from a cocoon will pass through a small number of these twists, though a greater will stop it. Your thread then breaks, and you pass what foulness there may be in the middle of your reel between the two hanks, which serves for a head-band to tie them.\n\nYou must observe that your water be just in a proper degree of heat. When it is too hot, the thread is dead, and has no body; when it is too cold, the ends which form the thread do not join well, and form a harsh ill-qualified silk.\n\nYou must change the water in your basin four times a day for your dupions and choquette, and twice only for good cocoons when you wind fine silk; but if you wind coarse silk, it is necessary to change it three or four times. For if you were not to change the water, the silk would not be so bright and glossy, because the worm contained...\ncontained in the cocoons foul it very considerably. You must endeavour to wind as much as possible with clear water, for if there are too many worms in it, your silk is covered with a kind of dust which attracts the moth, and destroys your silk.\n\nYou may wind your silk of what size you please, from one cocoon to 1000; but it is difficult to wind more than 30 in a thread. The nicety, and that in which consists the greatest difficulty, is to wind even; because as the cocoon winds off the end is finer, and you must then join other cocoons to keep up the same size. This difficulty of keeping the silk always even is so great, that (excepting a thread of two cocoons, which we call such) we do not say a silk of three, of four, or five cocoons; but a silk of three to four, of four to five, of six to seven cocoons. If you proceed to a coarser silk, you cannot calculate so nicely as to one cocoon more or less. We say, for example, from 12 to 15, from 15 to 20, and so on.\n\nWhat number of worms are necessary to produce a certain quantity of silk has not been ascertained. And as different persons who wished to determine this point have had different results, the truth seems to be, that from various circumstances the same number of worms may produce more silk at one time than at another. It is related in the second volume of the Transactions of the Society for encouraging Arts, &c., that Mrs Williams obtained nearly an ounce and a half of silk from 244 cocoons. Mr Swaine from 50 cocoons procured 100 grams. Miss Rhodes obtained from 250 of the largest cocoons, three quarters of an ounce and a dram. From a paper in the second volume of the American Transactions, which we have before referred to in the course of this article, we are informed that 150 ounces of good cocoons yield about 11 ounces of silk from five to six cocoons; if you wind coarser, something more. But what appears astonishing, Mr Salvatore Bertesen, an Italian, to whom the Society for encouraging Arts, &c., adjudged their gold medal, raised five pounds of excellent silk from 12,000 worms.\n\nThe cocoons produce a thread of very unequal length; you may meet with some that yield 1200 ells, whilst others will scarcely afford 200 ells. In general, you may calculate the production of a cocoon from 300 to 600 ells in length.\n\n**SILK-ROOM.** See **WEAVING**.\n\n**SILK WORM.** See **SILK**.\n\n**SILLA,** a large town on the Niger, by which the travels of Mr Park were bounded towards the east.

But their language was extremely different from the other parts of Bambarra; and he was given to understand, that in his progress eastward, the Bambarra tongue was very little understood; and that, on his reaching Jenné, he would find the greater part of the inhabitants accustomed to speak a different language.

If you would have it richly done, you must rub on more of the powder; and, in the last place, wash the silvered metal in pure water, and rub it hard with a dry cloth.\n\n**SILVERING of Glasses.** See **FOLLATING of Looking-Glasses.**\n\n**SILURIS,** a genus of fishes belonging to the order *abdominales.* See **ICHTHYOLOGY Index.**\n\n**SIMANCAS,** a village on the eastern boundary of the kingdom of Leon in Spain, six miles below Valladolid, on the river Gifnerga. Dr Robertson, in the introduction to his History of America, makes mention of it, and it is remarkable for the archives of the kingdoms of Leon and Castile, kept in the castle. This collection was begun when the kings often resided at Valladolid, in which city is still the civil and military tribunal for almost the whole of Spain, to the north of the Tagus. It was thought proper to have those papers kept in the vicinity of that court, for which purpose this castle was peculiarly fitted, being entirely erected of stone. At one period there were two large halls in this office filled with papers respecting the first settlement of the Spaniards in South America. There was likewise in the room called the *ancient royal patronage,* a box containing...\nSimancas containing treaties with England, in which are many letters and treaties between the kings of England and Spain, from the year 1400 to 1600. There was also a strong box in the same archives, with five locks, which, we are told, has not been opened since the time of Philip II. and it is supposed that it contains the proceeds against Philip's son Prince Charles. But it appears that some of the state papers have been removed to Madrid.\n\nSIMEON of DURHAM, the cotemporary of William of Malmesbury, took great pains in collecting the monuments of our history, especially in the north of England, after they had been scattered by the Danes. From these he composed a history of the kings of England, from A.D. 616 to 1130; with some smaller historical pieces. Simeon both studied and taught the sciences, and particularly the mathematics at Oxford; and became precentor of the church at Durham, where he died, probably soon after the conclusion of his history, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to A.D. 1156.\n\nSIMIA, the MONKEY, a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the class of mammalia, and order of primates, in the Linnaean system, but by Mr Pennant arranged under the digitated quadrupeds. See MAMMALIA Index.\n\nSIMILE, or SIMILITUDE, in Rhetoric, a comparison of two things, which though different in other respects, yet agree in some one. The difference between a simile and comparison is said to consist in this, that the simile properly belongs to whatever we call the quality of a thing, and the comparison to the quantity.

See the History of the JEWS, No. 15.\n\nSIMON Magus, or the Sorcerer, was a native of Gittton, a village of Samaria. According to the usual practice of the Asiatics of that age, he visited Egypt, and there probably became acquainted with the sublime mysteries taught in the Alexandrian school, and learned those theurgic or magical operations, by means of which it was believed that men might be delivered from the power of evil demons. Upon his return into his own country, the author of the Clementine Recognitions relates, that he imposed upon his countrymen by high pretensions to supernatural powers. And St Luke attests, that this artful fanatic, using sorcery, had bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one; and that he obtained such general attention and reverence in Samaria, that the people all gave heed to him from the least to the greatest, saying, \"This man is the great power of God.\"\n\nBy the preaching of Philip the Deacon, he was with other Samaritans converted to the Christian faith, and admitted into the infant church by the ordinance of baptism. His conversion, however, seems not to have been real; for, upon seeing the miraculous effects of the laying on of the apostle's hands, he offered them money, saying, \"Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost.\" He probably thought Peter and John magicians like Simon himself, but better skilled in the art of deceiving the multitude.\n\nBeing sharply reproved for this impiety, he seems by his answer to have been made sensible of his sin; but his repentance, if sincere, was of short duration. Returning to his former practices of imposture, he traveled through various provinces of the empire, opposing the progress of the gospel; and arriving at Rome, he led astray vast numbers of people by his pretended miracles. How long he lived in that metropolis of the world, or in what manner he died, we have no accounts that can be fully depended on. The Christian writers tell us, that being raised in the air by two demons, he was deprived of their support by the prayers of St Peter and St Paul, and falling, broke his legs. By some he is thought to have been the person mentioned by Suetonius, who, undertaking to fly in the presence of Nero, fell to the ground with such violence, that his blood spurted up to the gallery where the emperor was sitting.\n\nThe sum of this impostor's doctrine, divested of allegory, was, that from the Divine Being, as a fountain of light, flow various orders of aeons, or eternal natures, subsisting within the plenitude of the divine essence; that beyond these, in the order of emanation, are different classes of intelligences, among the lowest of which are human souls; that matter is the most remote production of the emanative power, which, on account of its infinite distance from the Fountain of Light, possesses fugitive and malignant qualities, which oppose the divine operations, and are the cause of evil; that it is the great design of philosophy to deliver the soul from its imprisonment in matter, and restore it to that divine light from which it was derived; and that for this purpose God had sent him one of the first aeons among men. To his wife Helena he also ascribed a similar kind of divine nature, pretending that a female aeon inhabited the body of this woman, to whom he gave the name of Ennoea, Wisdom; whence some Christian fathers have said, that he called her the Holy Spirit. He also taught the transmigration of souls, and denied the resurrection of the body.\n\nSIMON, Richard, was born at Dieppe the 15th May 1638. He began his studies among the priests of the Oratory in that city, but quitted their society in a short time. From Dieppe he went to Paris, where he made great progress in the study of the oriental languages. Some time afterwards he joined the society of the Oratory again, and became a priest of it in 1660. In 1670 he published some pieces of a smaller kind. In 1673 his Critical History of the Old Testament appeared, but was immediately suppressed by the intrigues of Messieurs du Port Royal. It was reprinted the year after, and its excellence soon drew the attention of foreigners; an edition of it was accordingly published at Amsterdam in Latin, and at London in English.\n\nHe died at Dieppe in 1712, at the age of 74.\n\nHe certainly possessed a vast deal of learning; his criticism is exact, but not always moderate; and there reigns in his writings a spirit of novelty and singularity which raised him a great many adversaries. The most celebrated of these were Le Clerc, Vossius, Jurieu, Du Pin, and Bossuet. Simon wrote an answer to most of the\nthe books that were published against him, and displays a pride and obstinacy in his controversial writings which do him little honour.\n\nHe was the author of a great many books. The following are the principal: 1. The Ceremonies of the Jews, translated from the Italian of Leo of Modena, with a supplement concerning the sects of the Carraites and Samaritans. 2. L'Histoire Critique du Vieux Testament, \"The Critical History of the Old Testament.\" This is a very important work, and deserves the attention of every clergyman. He sometimes, however, deviates from the road of integrity, to serve the cause of the church of Rome, particularly in his endeavours to prove the uncertainty of the Hebrew language. These passages have been very justly exposed and confuted by Dr Campbell, in his ingenious Preliminary Dissertations to his new Translation of the Gospels. 3. Critical History of the Text of the New Testament. 4. Critical History of the Versions of the New Testament. 5. Critical History of the principal Commentators on the New Testament. 6. Inspiration of the Sacred Books. 7. A translation of the New Testament. This book was censured by Cardinal Noailles and Bossuet. 8. The History of the rise and progress of Ecclesiastical Revenues, which is commended by Voltaire, as is his Critical History of the Old Testament. It resulted from a quarrel with a community of Benedictines. 9. A new select Library, which points out the good books in various kinds of literature, and the use to be made of them. 10. Critical History of the Belief and Customs of the Nations on the Levant. 11. Critical Letters, &c.\n\nSIMONICAL, is applied to any person guilty of simony. See SIMONY.\n\nSIMONIDES, the name of several poets celebrated in antiquity; but by the Marbles it appears that the eldest and most illustrious of them was born in the 55th Olympiad, 538 years B.C. and that he died in his 90th year; which nearly agrees with the chronology of Eusebius. He was a native of Ceos, one of the Cyclades, in the neighbourhood of Attica, and the preceptor of Pindar. Both Plato and Cicero give him the character not only of a good poet and musician, but speak of him as a person of great virtue and wisdom. Such longevity gave him an opportunity of knowing a great number of the first characters in antiquity with whom he was in some measure connected. It appears in Fabricius, from ancient authority, that Simonides was contemporary and in friendship with Pittacus of Mitylene, Hipparchus tyrant of Athens, Pausanias king of Sparta, Hiero tyrant of Syracuse, with Themistocles, and with Alcæades king of Thessaly. He is mentioned by Herodotus; and Xenophon, in his Dialogue upon Tyranny, makes him one of the interlocutors with Hiero king of Syracuse. Cicero alleges, what has often been quoted in proof of the modesty and wisdom of Simonides, that when Hiero asked him for a definition of God, the poet required a whole day to meditate on so important a question: at the end of which, upon the prince putting the same question to him a second time, he asked two days respite; and in this manner always doubled the delay each time he was required to answer it; till at length, to avoid offending his patron by more disappointments, he frankly confessed that he found the question so difficult, that the more he meditated upon it, the less was his hope of Simonides being able to solve it.\n\nIn his old age, perhaps from feeling the respect which money procured to such as had lost the charms of youth and the power of attaching mankind by other means, he became somewhat mercenary and avaricious. He was frequently employed by the victors at the games to write panegyrics and odes in their praise, before his pupil Pindar had exercised his talents in their behalf; but Simonides would never gratify their vanity in this particular, till he had first tied them down to a stipulated sum for his trouble; and upon being upbraided for his meanness, he said, that he had two coffers, in one of which he had for many years put his pecuniary rewards; the other was for honours, verbal thanks, and promises; that the first was pretty well filled, but the last remained always empty. And he made no scruple to confess, in his old age, that of all the enjoyments of life, the love of money was the only one of which time had not deprived him.\n\nHe was frequently reproached for this vice; however, he always defended himself with good humour. Upon being asked by Hiero's queen, Whether it was most desirable to be learned or rich? he answered, that it was far better to be rich; for the learned were always dependent on the rich, and waiting at their doors; whereas, he never saw rich men at the doors of the learned. When he was accused of being too fond as to sell part of the provisions with which his table was furnished by Hiero, he said he had done it in order \"to display to the world the magnificence of that prince and his own frugality.\" To others he said, that his reason for accumulating wealth was, that \"he would rather leave money to his enemies after death, than be troublesome to his friends while living.\"\n\nHe obtained the prize in poetry at the public games when he was four score years of age. According to Suidas, he added four letters to the Greek alphabet; and Pliny assigns to him the eighth string of the lyre; but these claims are disputed by the learned.\n\nHis poetry was so tender and plaintive, that he acquired the cognomen of Melicertes, \"sweet as honey;\" and the tearful eye of his muse was proverbial. Dionysius places him among those polished writers who excel in a smooth volubility, and flow on like plentiful and perennial rivers, in a course of even and uninterrupted harmony.\n\nIt is to Dionysius that we are indebted for the preservation of the following fragment of this poet. Danae being by her merciless father inclosed in a chest, and thrown into the sea with her child, when night comes on, and a storm arises which threatens to overturn the chest, she, weeping and embracing the young Perseus, cries out:\n\nSweet child! what anguish does thy mother know,\nEre cruel grief has taught thy tears to flow!\nAmidst the roaring wind's tremendous sound,\nWhich threats destruction as it howls around;\nIn balmy sleep thou liest, as at the breast,\nWithout one bitter thought to break thy rest.—\nThe glimmering moon in pity hides her light,\nAnd shrinks with horror at the ghastly sight.\nDidst thou but know, sweet innocent! our woes,\nNot opiate's pow'r thy eyelids now could close.\n\nSleep\nSleep on, sweet babe! ye waves in silence roll;\nAnd lull, O lull, to rest my tortur'd soul!\n\nThere is a second great poet of the name of Simonides recorded on the Marbles, supposed to have been his grandson, and who gained, in 478 B.C., the prize in the games at Athens.\n\nSIMONY, is the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical benefice for money, gift, or reward. It is so called from the resemblance it is said to bear to the sin of Simon Magus, though the purchasing of holy orders seems to approach nearer to his offence. It was by the canon law a very grievous crime; and is so much the more odious, because, as Sir Edward Coke observes, it is ever accompanied with perjury; for the pretender is sworn to have committed no simony. However, it was not an offence punishable in a criminal way at the common law: it being thought sufficient to leave the clerk to ecclesiastical censures. But as these did not affect the simoniacal patron, nor were efficacious enough to repel the notorious practice of the thing, divers acts of parliament have been made to restrain it by means of civil forfeitures; which the modern prevailing usage, with regard to spiritual preferments, calls aloud to be put in execution. The statute 31 Eliz. c. 6. enacts, that if any patron, for money or any other corrupt consideration or promise, directly or indirectly given, shall present, admit, institute, induct, install, or collate any person to an ecclesiastical benefice or dignity, both the giver and taker shall forfeit two years value of the benefice or dignity; one moiety to the king, and the other to any one who will sue for the same. If persons also corruptly resign or exchange their benefices, both the giver and taker shall in like manner forfeit double the value of the money or other corrupt consideration. And persons who shall corruptly ordain or license any minister, or procure him to be ordained or licensed (which is the true idea of simony), shall incur a like forfeiture of forty pounds; and the minister himself of ten pounds, besides an incapacity to hold any ecclesiastical preferment for seven years afterwards. Corrupt elections and resignations in colleges, hospitals, and other eleemosynary corporations, are also punished, by the same statute, with forfeiture of the double value, vacating the place or office, and a devolution of the right of election, for that turn, to the crown.\n\nSIMOON, a hot wind which blows occasionally in the deserts of Africa, and probably in other widely extended countries parched in the same manner by a vertical sun. Its effects on the human body are dreadful. If inhaled in any quantity, it produces instant suffocation, or at least leaves the unhappy sufferer oppressed with asthma and lowness of spirits. The approach of this awful scourge of God is indicated by a redness in the air, well understood by those who are accustomed to journey through the desert; and the only refuge which they have from it, is to fall down with their faces close to the ground, and to continue as long as possible without drawing in their breath.\n\nMr Bruce, who, in his journey through the desert, suffered from the simoon, gives of it the following graphical description: \"At eleven o'clock, while we contemplated with great pleasure the rugged top of Chigge, to which we were fast approaching, and where we were to solace ourselves with plenty of good water, Idris our guide cried out, with a loud voice, Fall upon Simoom your faces, for here is the simoom. I saw from the south-east a haze come, in colour like the purple part of the rainbow, but not so compressed or thick. It did not occupy twenty yards in breadth, and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of bluish upon the air, and it moved very rapidly; for I scarce could turn to fall upon the ground with my head to the northward, when I felt the heat of its current plainly upon my face. We all lay flat on the ground as if dead, till Idris told us it was blown over. The meteor or purple haze which I saw was indeed passed, but the light air that still blew was of heat to threaten suffocation. For my part, I found difficulty in my breast that I had imbibed a part of it, nor was I free of an asthmatic sensation till I had been some months in Italy, at the baths of Porretta, near two years afterwards.\" Though the severity of this blast seems to have passed over them almost instantaneously, it continued to blow so as to exhaust them till twenty minutes before five in the afternoon, lasting through all its stages very near six hours, and leaving them in a state of the utmost depondency.\n\nSIMPLE, something not mixed or compounded; in which sense it stands opposed to compound.\n\nSIMPLE, in the Materia Medica, a general name for all herbs or plants, as having each its particular virtue, whereby it becomes a simple remedy.\n\nSIMPLICITY IN WRITING. If we examine the writers whose compositions have stood the test of ages, and obtained that highest honour, \"the concurrent approbation of distant times and nations,\" we shall find that the character of simplicity is the unvarying circumstance which alone hath been able to gain this universal homage from mankind. Among the Greeks, whose writers in general are of the simple kind, the divinest poet, the most commanding orator, the finest historian, and deepest philosopher, are, above the rest, conspicuously eminent in this great quality. The Roman writers rise towards perfection according to that measure of simplicity which they mingle in their works; indeed they are all inferior to the Greek models. But who will deny that Lucretius, Horace, Virgil, Livy, Terence, Tully, are at once the simplest and best of Roman writers? unless we add the noble annalist who appeared in after-times; who, notwithstanding the political turn of his genius, which sometimes interferes, is admirable in this great quality, and by it far superior to his contemporaries. It is this one circumstance that hath raised the venerable Dante, the father of modern poetry, above the succeeding poets of his country, who could never long maintain the local and temporary honours bestowed upon them; but have fallen under that just neglect which time will ever decree to those who deform a just simplicity for the florid colourings of style, contrived phrases, affected conceits, the mere trappings of composition and Gothic minuet. It is this which has given to Boileau the most lasting wreath in France, and to Shakespeare and Milton in England; especially to the former, whose writings contain specimens of perhaps the purest and simplest English that is anywhere to be found, except in the Bible or Book of Common Prayer. As it appears from these instances, that simplicity is the only universal characteristic of just writing, so the superior eminence of the sacred Scriptures in\nSimplicity in this quality hath been generally acknowledged.\n\nOne of the greatest critics in antiquity, himself conspicuous in the sublime and simple manner, hath borne this testimony to the writings of Moses and St Paul; and by parity of reason we must conclude, that had he been conversant with the other sacred writers, his taste and candour would have allowed them the same encomium.\n\nIt hath been often observed, even by writers of no mean rank, that the \"Scriptures suffer in their credit by the disadvantage of a literal version, while other ancient writings enjoy the advantage of a free and embellished translation.\" But in reality these gentlemen's concern is ill placed and groundless: for the truth is, \"that most other writings are impaired by a literal translation; whereas giving only a due regard to the idiom of different languages, the sacred writings, when literally translated, are then in their full perfection.\"\n\nNow this is an internal proof, that in all other writings there is a mixture of local, relative, exterior ornament, which is often lost in the transmutation from one language to another. But the internal beauties, which depend not on the particular construction of tongues, no change of tongue can destroy. Hence the Bible preserves its native beauty and strength alike in every language, by the sole energy of unadorned phrase, natural images, weight of sentiment, and great simplicity.\n\nIt is in this respect like a rich vein of gold, which, under the severest trials of heat, cold, and moisture, retains its original weight and splendour, without either loss or alloy; while baser metals are corrupted by earth, air, water, fire, and assimilated to the various elements through which they pass.\n\nThis circumstance, then, may be justly regarded as sufficient to vindicate the composition of the sacred Scriptures, as it is at once their chief excellence and greatest security. It is their excellence, as it renders them intelligible and useful to all; it is their security, as it prevents their being disguised by the false and capricious ornaments of vain or weak translators. We may safely appeal to experience and fact for the confirmation of these remarks on the superior simplicity, utility, and excellence, of the style of the Holy Scripture. Is there any book in the world so perfectly adapted to all capacities? that contains such sublime and exalted precepts, conveyed in such an artless and intelligible strain, that can be read with such pleasure and advantage by the lettered sage and the unlettered peasant?\n\nSIMPOCE. See Oratory, No 72.\n\nSIMPSON, Thomas, professor of mathematics at the royal academy at Woolwich, fellow of the Royal Society, and member of the Royal Academy at Stockholm, was born at Market Bolworth in Leicestershire in 1710. His father, a stuff-weaver, taught him only to read English, and brought him up to his own business; but meeting with a scientific pedlar, who likewise practised fortune-telling, young Simpson by his assistance and advice left off weaving, and professed astrology. As he improved in knowledge, however, he grew disgusted with his pretended art; and renouncing it, was driven to such difficulties for the subsistence of his family, that he came up to London, where he worked as a weaver, and taught mathematics at his spare hours.\n\nAs his scholars increased, his abilities became better known, and he published his Treatise on Fluxions, by subscription, in 1737: in 1740, he published his Treatise on the Nature and Laws of Chance; and Essays in Speculative and Mixed Mathematics. After these appeared his Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions; Mathematical Differations; Treatise on Algebra; Elements of Geometry; Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical; Select Exercises; and his Doctrine and Application of Fluxions, which he professes to be rather a new work, than a second edition of his former publication on fluxions. In 1743, he obtained the mathematical professorship at Woolwich academy; and soon after was chosen a member of the Royal Society, when the president and council, in consideration of his moderate circumstances, were pleased to excuse his admission fees, and his giving bonds for the settled future payments. At the academy he exerted all his abilities in instructing the pupils who were the immediate objects of his duty, as well as others whom the superior officers of the ordnance permitted to be boarded and lodged in his house. In his manner of teaching he had a peculiar and happy address, a certain dignity and perspicuity, tempered with such a degree of mildness, as engaged the attention, esteem, and friendship, of his scholars. He therefore acquired great applause from his superiors in the discharge of his duty. His application and close confinement, however, injured his health. Exercise and a proper regimen were prescribed to him, but to little purpose: for his spirits sunk gradually, till he became incapable of performing his duty, or even of reading the letters of his friends. The effects of this decay of nature were greatly increased by vexation of mind, owing to the haughty and insulting behaviour of his superior the first professor of mathematics. This person, greatly his inferior in mathematical accomplishments, did what he could to make his situation uneasy, and even to depreciate him in the public opinion: but it was a vain endeavour, and only served to depress himself. At length his physicians advised his native air for his recovery, and he set out in February 1764; but was so fatigued by his journey, that upon his arrival at Bolworth, he betook himself to his chamber, and grew continually worse till the day of his death, which happened on the 14th of May, in the 51st year of his age.\n\nSIMSON, Dr Robert, professor of mathematics in the university of Glasgow, was born in the year 1687 of a respectable family, which had held a small estate in the county of Lanark for some generations. He was, we think, the second son of the family. A younger brother was professor of medicine in the university of St Andrew's, and is known by some works of reputation, particularly a Dissertation on the Nervous System, occasioned by the Dissection of a Brain completely Olfitted.\n\nDr Simson was educated in the university of Glasgow under the eye of some of his relations who were professors. Eager after knowledge, he made great progress in all his studies; and, as his mind did not, at the very first openings of science, strike into that path which afterwards so strongly attracted him, and in which he proceeded so far almost without a companion, he acquired in every walk of science a stock of information, which, though it had never been much augmented afterwards, would have done credit to a professional man.\nin any of his studies. He became, at a very early period, an adept in the philosophy and theology of the schools, was able to supply the place of a sick relation in the clasps of oriental languages, was noted for historical knowledge, and one of the most knowing botanists of his time.\n\nIt was during his theological studies, as preparatory for his entering into orders, that mathematics took hold of his fancy. He used to tell in his convivial moments how he amused himself when preparing his exercises for the divinity hall. When tired with vague speculation, in which he did not meet with certainty to reward his labours, he turned up a book of oriental philology, in which he found something which he could discover to be true or to be false, without going out of the line of study which was to be of ultimate use to him. Sometimes even this could not relieve his fatigue. He then had recourse to mathematics, which never failed to satisfy and refresh him. For a long while he restricted himself to a very moderate use of the cordial, fearing that he would soon exhaust the final stock which so limited and abstract a science could yield; till at last he found, that the more he learned, a wider field opened to his view, and scenes that were inexhaustible. Becoming acquainted with subjects far beyond the elements of the science, and with numbers of names celebrated during that period of ardent research all over Europe, he found it to be a manly and important study, by which he was as likely to acquire reputation as by any other. About this time, too, a prospect began to open of making mathematics his profession for life. He then gave himself up to it without reserve.\n\nHis original incitement to this study as a treat, as something to please and refresh his mind in the midst of severer tasks, gave a particular turn to his mathematical studies, from which he never could afterwards deviate. Perspicuity and elegance are more attainable, and more discernible, in pure geometry, than in any other parts of the science of measure. To this therefore he chiefly devoted himself. For the same reason he preferred the ancient method of studying pure geometry, and even felt a dislike to the Cartesian method of substituting symbols for operations of the mind, and still more was he disgusted with the substitution of symbols for the very objects of discussion, for lines, surfaces, solids, and their affections. He was rather disposed in the solution of an algebraical problem, where quantity alone was considered, to substitute figure and its affections for the algebraical symbols, and to convert the algebraic formula into an analogous geometrical theorem. And he came at last to consider algebraic analysis as little better than a kind of mechanical knack, in which we proceed without ideas of any kind, and obtain a result without meaning, and without being conscious of any process of reasoning, and therefore without any conviction of its truth. And there is no denying, that if genuine unphilosophic taste alone is to be consulted, Dr Simson was in the right: for though it must also be acknowledged, that the reasoning in algebra is as strict as in the purest geometry of Euclid or Apollonius, the expert analyst has little perception of it as he goes on, and his final equation is not felt by himself as the result of ratiocination, any more than if he had obtained it by Pascal's arithmetical mill. This does not in the least diminish our admiration of the algebraic analysis; for its almost boundless grasp, its rapid and certain procedure, and the delicate metaphysics and great address which may be displayed in conducting it. Such, however, was the ground of the strong bias of Dr Simson's mind to the analysis of the ancient geometers. It increased as he went forward; and his veneration (we may call it his love or affection) for the ancient geometry was carried to a degree of idolatry. His chief labours were exerted in efforts to restore the works of the ancient geometers; and he has nowhere bestowed much pains in advancing the modern discoveries in mathematics. The noble inventions, for example, of fluxions and of logarithms, by which our progress in mathematical knowledge, and in the useful application of this knowledge, is so much promoted, attracted the notice of Dr Simson; but he has contented himself with demonstrating their truth on the genuine principles of the ancient geometry. Yet was he very thoroughly acquainted with all the modern discoveries; and there are to be seen among his papers discussions and investigations in the Cartesian method, which show him thoroughly acquainted with all the principles, and even expert in the tours de main, of the most refined symbolical analysis (A).\n\nAbout the age of 25 Dr Simson was chosen professor of mathematics in the university of Glasgow. He went to London immediately after his appointment, and there formed an acquaintance with the most eminent men of that bright era of British science. Among these he always mentioned Captain Halley (the celebrated Dr Edmund Halley) with particular respect; saying, that he had the most acute penetration, and the most just taste in that science, of any man he had ever known. And, indeed, Dr Halley has strongly exemplified both of these in his divination of the work of Apollonius de Sectione Spatii, and the 8th book of his Conics, and in some of the most beautiful theorems in Sir Isaac Newton's Principia. Dr Simson also admired the wide and masterly steps which Newton was accustomed to take in his investigations, and his manner of substituting geometrical figures for the quantities which are observed in the phenomena of nature. It was from Dr Simson that the writer of this article had the remark which has been oftener than once repeated in the course of this Work, \"That the 39th proposition of the first book of the Principia was the most important proposition\n\n(A) In 1752 the writer of this article being then his scholar, requested him to examine an account which he gave him of what he thought a new curve (a conchoid having a circle for its base). Dr Simson returned it next day with a regular list of its leading properties, and the investigation of such as he thought his scholar would not so easily trace. In this hasty crawl the lines related to the circle were familiarly considered as arithmetical fractions of the radius considered as unity. This was before Euler published his Arithmetic of the Sines and Tangents, now in universal use.\nposition that had ever been exhibited to the physico-mathematical philosopher;\" and he used always to illustrate to his more advanced scholars the superiority of the geometrical over the algebraic analysis, by comparing the solution given by Newton of the inverse problem of centripetal forces, in the 42nd proposition of that book, with the one given by John Bernoulli in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris for 1713. We have heard him say, that to his own knowledge Newton frequently investigated his propositions in the symbolical way, and that it was owing chiefly to Dr Halley that they did not finally appear in that dress. But if Dr Simson was well informed, we think it a great argument in favour of the symbolical analysis, when this most successful practical artist (for so we must call Newton when engaged in a task of discovery) found it conducive either to dispatch or perhaps to his very progress.\n\nReturning to his academical chair, Dr Simson discharged the duties of a professor for more than 50 years with great honour to the university and to himself.\n\nIt is almost needless to say, that in his prelections he followed strictly the Euclidian method in elementary geometry. He made use of Theodosius as an introduction to spherical trigonometry. In the higher geometry he proceeded from his own Conics; and he gave a small specimen of the linear problems of the ancients, by explaining the properties, sometimes of the conchoid, sometimes of the cissoid, with their application to the solution of such problems. In the more advanced class he was accustomed to give Napier's mode of conceiving logarithms, i.e., quantities as generated by motion; and Mr Cotes's view of them, as the sums of ratiunculae; and to demonstrate Newton's lemmas concerning the limits of ratios; and then to give the elements of the fluxionary calculus; and to finish his course with a select set of propositions in optics, gnomonics, and central forces. His method of teaching was simple and perspicuous, his elocution clear, and his manner easy and impressive. He had the respect, and still more the affection, of his scholars.\n\nWith respect to his studies, we have already informed the reader that they got an early bias to pure geometry, and to the elegant but scrupulous methods of the ancients.\n\nWe have heard Dr Simson say, that it was in a great measure owing to Dr Halley that he so early directed his efforts to the restoration of the ancient geometers. He had recommended this to him, as the most certain way for him, then a very young man, both to acquire reputation, and to improve his own knowledge and taste, and he presented him with a copy of Pappus's Mathematical Collections, enriched with some of his own notes. The perspicuity of the ancient geometrical analysis, and a certain elegance in the nature of the solutions which it affords, especially by means of the local theorems, soon took firm hold of his fancy, and made him, with the sanguine expectation of a young man, direct his very first efforts to the recovery of this in toto; and the restoration of Euclid's Porisms was the first task which he set himself. The accomplished geometer knows what a desperate task this was, from the scanty and mutilated account which we have of this work in a single passage of Pappus. It was an ambition which nothing but success could justify in so young an adventurer. He succeeded; and so early as 1718 seemed to have been in complete possession of this method of investigation, which was considered by the eminent geometers of antiquity as their surest guide through the labyrinths of the higher geometry. Dr Simson gave a specimen of his discovery in 1723 in the Philosophical Transactions. And after this time he ceased not from his endeavours to recover that choice collection of Porisms which Euclid had collected, as of the most general use in the solution of difficult questions. What some of these must have been was pointed out to Dr Simson by the very nature of the general proposition of Pappus, which he has restored. Others were pointed out by the lemmas which Pappus has given as helps to the young mathematician towards their demonstration. And, being thus in possession of a considerable number, their mutual relations pointed out a sort of system, of which they made a part, and of which the blanks now remained to be filled up.\n\nDr Simson, having thus gained his favourite point, had leisure to turn his attention to the other works of the ancient geometers; and the porisms of Euclid now had only an occasional share. The loci plani of Apollonius was another task which he very early engaged in, and completed about the year 1738. But, after it was printed, he imagined that he had not given the plenissime propositiones of Apollonius, and in the precise spirit and order of that author. The impression lay by him for some years; and it was with great reluctance that he yielded to the entreaties of his mathematical friends, and published the work, in 1746, with some emendations, where he thought he had deviated farthest from his author. He quickly repented of this scanty concession, and recalled what he could of the small number of copies which he had given to the bookellers, and the impression again lay by him for years. He afterwards recorrected the work, and still with some reluctance allowed it to come abroad as the Restitution of Apollonius. The public, however, had not been so faithful as Dr Simson, and the work had acquired great celebrity, and he was now considered as one of the first and the most elegant geometers of the age: for, in the mean time, he had published his Conic Sections, a work of uncommon merit, whether we consider it as equivalent to a complete restitution of the celebrated work of Apollonius Pergaeus, or as an excellent system of this important part of mathematics. It is marked with the same features as the loci plani, the most anxious solicitude to exhibit the very text of Apollonius, even in the propositions belonging to the books which had been completely lost. These could be recovered in no other way but by a thorough knowledge of the precise plan proposed by the author, and by taking it for granted that the author had accurately accomplished this plan. In this manner did Viviani proceed in the first attempt which was made to restore the conics of Apollonius; and he has given us a detail of the process of his conjectures, by which we may form an opinion of its justness, and of the probability how far he has attained the desired object. Dr Simson's view in his performance was something different, deviating a little in this one case from his general track. He was not altogether pleased with the work of Viviani, even as augmented by the eighth book added by Halley, and his wish was to restore the ancient original. But, in the mean time, an academical\nacademical text book for conic sections was much wanted. He was much dissatisfied with those in common use; and he was not insensible of the advantage resulting from the consideration of these sections, independent of the cone first introduced by Dr Wallis. He therefore composed this excellent treatise as an elementary book, not to supersede, but to prepare for the study of Apollonius; and accordingly accommodates it to this purpose, and gives several important propositions in their proper places, expressly as refutations of Apollonius, whom he keeps constantly in view through the whole work.\n\nMuch about this time Dr Simson seriously began to prepare a perfect edition of Euclid's Elements. The intimate acquaintance which he had by this time acquired with all the original works of the ancient geometers, and their ancient commentators and critics, encouraged him to hope that he could restore to his original lustre this leader in mathematical science; and the errors which had crept into this celebrated work, and which still remained in it, appeared of magnitude sufficient to merit the most careful efforts for their removal. The data also, which were in like manner the introduction to the whole art of geometrical investigation, seemed to call more loudly for his amending hand. For it appears that the Saracens, who have preferred to us the writings of the ancients, have contented themselves with admiring these celebrated works, and have availed themselves of the knowledge which they contain; but they have shown no inclination to add to the stock, or to promote the sciences which they had received. They could not do any thing without the synthetical books of the geometers; but, not meaning to go beyond the discoveries which they had made, they neglected all the books which related to the analytic art alone, and the greatest part of them (about 25 out of 30) have irrecoverably perished. The data of Euclid have fortunately been preserved, but the book was neglected, and the only ancient copies, which are but three or four, are miserably erroneous and mutilated. Fortunately, it is no very arduous matter to reinstate this work in its original perfection. The plan is precise, both in its extent and its method. It had been restored, therefore, with success by more than one author. But Dr Simson's comprehensive view of the whole analytical system pointed out to him many occasions for amendment. He therefore made its imitation a joint task with that of the elements. All the lovers of true geometry will acknowledge their obligations to him for the edition of the Elements and data which he published about 1758. The text is corrected with the most judicious and scrupulous care, and the notes are ineffinable, both for their information, and for the tendency which they must have to form the mind of the student to a true judgement and taste in mathematical subjects. The more accomplished reader will perhaps sometimes dispose to smile at the axiom which seems to pervade the notes, \"that a work of Euclid must be supposed without error or defect.\" If this was not the case, Euclid has been obliged to his editor in more instances than one. Nor should his greatest admirers think it impossible that in the progress of human improvement, a geometrical truth should occur to one of these latter days, which escaped the notice of even the Lincean Euclid. Such merit, however, Dr Simson nowhere claims, but lays every blame of error, omission, or obscurity, to the charge of Proclus, Theon, and other editors and commentators of the renowned Grecian.\n\nThere is another work of Apollonius on which Dr Simson has bestowed great pains, and has restored, as we imagine, omnibus numeris perfectum, viz. the Sectio determinata; one of those performances which are of indispensible use in the application of the ancient analysis. This also seems to have been an early task, though we do not know the date of his labours on it. It did not appear till after his death, being then published along with the great work, the Porisms of Euclid, at the expense of the late Earl Stanhope, a nobleman intimately conversant with the ancient geometry, and zealous for its reception among the mathematicians of the present age. He had kept up a constant correspondence with Dr Simson on mathematical subjects; and at his death in 1768, engaged Mr Clow professor of logic in the university of Glasgow, to whose care the Doctor had left all his valuable papers, to make a selection of such as would serve to support and increase his well-earned reputation as the Restorer of Ancient Geometry.\n\nWe have been thus particular in our account of Dr Simson's labours in these works, because his manner of execution, while it does honour to his inventive powers, and shows his just taste in mathematical composition, also confirms our former assertion, that he carried his respect for the ancient geometers to a degree of superstitious idolatry, and that his fancy, unchecked, viewed them as incapable of error or imperfection. This is distinctly to be seen in the emendations which he has given of the texts, particularly in his editions of Euclid. Not only every imperfection of the reading is ascribed to the ignorance of copyists, and every indistinctness in the conception, inconclusiveness in the reasoning, and defect in the method, is ascribed to the ignorance or mistake of the commentators; but it is all along assumed that the work was perfect in its kind; and that by exhibiting a perfect work, we restore the genuine original. This is surely gratuitous; and it is very possible that it has, in some instances, made Dr Simson fail of his anxious purpose, and give us even a better than the original. It has undoubtedly made him fail in what should have been his great purpose, viz. to give the world a connected system of the ancient geometrical analysis; such as would, in the first place, exhibit it in its most engaging form, elegant, perspicuous, and comprehensive; and, in the next place, such as should engage the mathematicians of the present age to adopt it as the most certain and successful conductor in those laborious and difficult researches in which the demands of modern science continually engage them. And this might have been expected, in the province of speculative geometry at least, from a person of such extensive knowledge of the properties of figure, and who had so eminently succeeded in the many trials which he had made of its powers. We might have expected that he would at least have exhibited in one systematic point of view, what the ancients had done in several detached branches of the science, and how far they had proceeded in the solution of the several successive classes of problems; and we might have hoped, that he would have instructed us in what manner we should apply that method to the solution of problems of a more elevated kind, daily presented.\nfented to us in the questions of physic-mathematical science. By this he would have acquired distinguished honour, and science would have received the most valuable improvement. But Dr Simson has done little of all this; and we cannot say that great helps have been derived from his labours by the eminent mathematicians of this age, who are successfully occupied in advancing our knowledge of nature, or in improving the arts of life. He has indeed contributed greatly to the entertainment of the speculative mathematician, who is more delighted with the conscious exercise of his own reasoning powers, than with the final result of his researches. Yet we are not even certain that Dr Simson has done this to the extent he wished and hoped. He has not engaged the liking of mathematicians to this analysis, by presenting it in the most agreeable form. His own extreme anxiety to tread in the very footsteps of the original authors, has, in a thousand instances, precluded him from using his own extensive knowledge, that he might not employ principles which were not of a class inferior to that of the question in hand. Thus, of necessity, did the method appear tramelled. We are deterred from employing a process which appears to restrain us in the application of the knowledge which we have already acquired; and, disgusted with the tedious, and perhaps indirect path, by which we must arrive at an object which we see clearly over the hedge, and which we could reach by a few steps, of the security of which we are otherwise perfectly assured. These prepositions are indeed founded on mistake; but the mistake is such, that all fall into it, till experience has enlarged their views. This circumstance alone has hitherto prevented mathematicians from acquiring that knowledge of the ancient analysis which would enable them to proceed in their researches with certainty, dispatch, and delight. It is therefore deeply to be regretted, that this eminent genius has occupied, in this superstitious palaeology, a long and busy life, which might have been employed in original works of infinite advantage to the world, and honour to himself.\n\nOur readers will, it is hoped, consider these observations as of general scientific importance, and as intimately connected with the history of mathematics; and therefore as not improperly introduced in the biographical account of one of the most eminent writers on this science. Dr Simson claimed our notice as a mathematician; and his affectionate admiration of the ancient analysis is the prominent feature of his literary character. By this he is known all over Europe; and his name is never mentioned by any foreign author without some very honourable allusion to his distinguished geometrical elegance and skill. Dr James Moor, professor of Greek in the university of Glasgow, no less eminent for his knowledge in ancient geometry than for his professional talents, put the following apposite inscription below a portrait of Dr Simson:\n\n**Geometriam, sub Tyranno barbaro sæva servitute diu squalentem, in libertatem et decus antiquum vindicavit.**\n\nUnus.\n\nYet it must not be understood that Dr Simson's predilection for the geometrical analysis of the ancients did so far mislead him as to make him neglect the symbolical analysis of the present times; on the contrary, he was completely master of it, as has been already observed, and frequently employed it. In his academical lectures to the students of his upper classes, he used to point out, its proper province (which he by no means limited by a scanty boundary), and in what cases it might be applied with safety and advantage even to questions of pure geometry. He once honoured the writer of this article with the sight of a very short dissertation on this subject (perhaps the one referred to in the preface to his Conic Sections). In this piece he was perhaps more liberal than the most zealous partisans of the symbolical analysis could desire, admitting as a sufficient equation of the Conic Sections \\( L = \\frac{p^2 c}{x} \\), where \\( L \\) is the latus rectum, \\( x \\) is the distance of any point of the curve from the focus, \\( p \\) is the perpendicular drawn from the focus to the tangent in the given point, and \\( c \\) is the chord of the equicurve circle drawn through the focus. Unfortunately this dissertation was not found among his papers. He spoke in high terms of the Analytical Works of Mr Cotes, and of the two Bernoullis. He was consulted by Mr M'Laurin during the progress of his infallible Treatise of Fluxions, and contributed not a little to the reputation of that work. The spirit of that most ingenious algebraic demonstration of the fluxions of a rectangle, and the very process of the argument, is the same with Dr Simson's in his dissertation on the limits of quantities. It was therefore from a thorough acquaintance with the subject, and by a just taste, that he was induced to prefer his favourite analysis, or, to speak more properly, to exhort mathematicians to employ it in its own sphere, and not to become ignorant of geometry, while he successfully employed the symbolical analysis in cases which did not require it, and which suffered by its admission. It must be acknowledged, however, that in his later years, the disgust which he felt at the artificial and slovenly employment on subjects of pure geometry, sometimes hindered him from even looking at the most refined and ingenious improvements of the algebraic analysis which occur in the writings of Euler, D'Alembert, and other eminent masters. But, when properly informed of them, he never failed to give them their due praise; and we remember him speaking, in terms of great satisfaction, of an improvement of the infinitesimal calculus, by D'Alembert and De la Grange, in their researches concerning the propagation of sound, and the vibrations of musical cords.\n\nAnd that Dr Simson not only was master of this calculus and the symbolical calculus in general, but held them in proper esteem, appears from two valuable dissertations to be found in his posthumous works; the one on logarithms, and the other on the limits of ratios. The latter, in particular, shows how completely he was satisfied with respect to the solid foundation of the method of fluxions; and it contains an elegant and strict demonstration of all the applications which have been made of the method by its illustrious author to the objects of pure geometry.\n\nWe hoped to have given a much more complete and instructive account of this eminent geometer and his works, by the aid of a person fully acquainted with both, and able to appreciate their value; but an accident has deprived us of this assistance, when it was too late to procure an equivalent: and we must request our readers to accept of this very imperfect account, since we cannot do justice to Dr Simson's merit, unless almost equally.\nequally conversant in all the geometry of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe life of a literary man rarely teems with anecdote; and a mathematician, devoted to his studies, is perhaps more abstracted than any other person from the ordinary occurrences of life, and even the ordinary topics of conversation. Dr Simson was of this class; and, having never married, lived entirely a college life. Having no occasion for the commodious house to which his place in the university entitled him, he contented himself with chambers, good indeed, and spacious enough for his sober accommodation, and for receiving his choice collection of mathematical writers, but without any decoration or commodious furniture. His official servant sufficed for valet, footman, and chambermaid. As this retirement was entirely devoted to study, he entertained no company in his chambers, but in a neighbouring house, where his apartment was sacred to him and his guests.\n\nHaving in early life devoted himself to the restoration of the works of the ancient geometers, he studied them with unremitting attention; and, retiring from the profuse intercourse of the world, he contented himself with a small society of intimate friends, with whom he could lay aside every restraint of ceremony or reserve, and indulge in all the innocent frivolities of life. Every Friday evening was spent in a party at which, in which he excelled, and took delight in instructing others, till increasing years made him less patient with the dulness of a scholar. The card-party was followed by an hour or two dedicated solely to playful conversation. In like manner, every Saturday he had a less select party to dinner at a house about a mile from town. The Doctor's long life gave him occasion to see the dramatic performance of this little theatre several times completely changed, while he continued to give it a personal identity: so that, without any design or wish of his own, it became, as it were, his own house and his own family, and went by his name. In this state did the present writer first see it, with Dr Simson as its father and head, respected and beloved by every branch; for, as it was for relaxation, and not for the enjoyment of his acknowledged superiority, that he continued this habit of his early youth; and as his notions \"of a fine talk\" did not consist in the pleasure of having \"talked and gored a good many to-day,\" his companions were as much at their ease as he wished to be himself; and it was no small part of their entertainment (and of his too), to smile at those innocent deviations from common forms, and those mistakes with respect to life and manners, which an almost total retirement from the world, and incessant occupation in an abstract science, caused this venerable precentor frequently to exhibit. These are remembered with a more affecting regret, that they are now \"with the days that are past,\" than the most pithy apophthegms, uttered in with an emphatical, \"Why, Sir!\" or \"No, Sir!\" which precludes all reply. Dr Simson never exerted his presiding authority, unless it were to check some infringement of good breeding, or any thing that appeared unfriendly to religion or purity of manners; for these he had the highest reverence. We have twice heard him sing (he had a fine voice and most accurate ear) some lines of a Latin hymn to the Divine Geometer, and each time the rapturous tear stood in his eye.\n\nBut we ask the reader's pardon for this digression; it is not however useless, since it paints the man as much as any recital of his studies; and to his acquaintances we are certain that it will be an acceptable memorandum. To them it was often matter of regret, that a person of such eminent talents, which would have made him shine equally in any line of life, should have allowed himself to be completely devoted to a study which abstracted him from the ordinary pursuits of men, unfitting him for the active enjoyment of life, and kept him out of those walks which they frequented, and where they would have rejoiced to meet him.\n\nDr Simson was of an advantageous stature, with a fine countenance; and even in his old age had a graceful carriage and manner, and always, except when in mourning, dressed in white cloth. He was of a cheerful disposition; and though he did not make the first advances to acquaintance, had the most affable manner, and strangers were at perfect ease in his company. He enjoyed a long course of uninterrupted health; but towards the close of life suffered from an acute disease, and was obliged to employ an assistant in his professional labours for a few years preceding his death, which happened in 1768, at the age of 81. He left to the university his valuable library, which is now arranged apart from the rest of the books, and the public use of it is limited by particular rules. It is considered as the most choice collection of mathematical books and manuscripts in the kingdom, and many of them are rendered doubly valuable by Dr Simson's notes.\n\nSIN, a breach or transgression of some divine law or command.\n\nSINAI, or SIN, a famous mountain of Arabia Petraea, upon which God gave the law to Moses. It stands in a kind of peninsula, formed by the two arms of the Red sea, one of which stretches out towards the north, and is called the gulf of Kaffum; the other extends towards the east, and is called the gulf of Elan, or the Eilanijs sea. At this day the Arabians call Mount Sinai by the name of Tor, that is, the \"mountain,\" by way of excellence; or Gibel or Jibbel Moufa, \"the mountain of Moses.\" It is 260 miles from Cairo, and generally it requires a journey of ten days to travel thither. The wilderness of Sinai, where the Israelites continued encamped for almost a year, and where Moses erected the tabernacle of the covenant, is considerably elevated above the rest of the country; and the ascent to it is by a very craggy way, the greatest part of which is cut out of the rock; then one comes to a large space of ground, which is a plain surrounded on all sides by rocks and eminences, whose length is nearly 12 miles. Towards the extremity of this plain, on the north side, two high mountains show themselves, the highest of which is called Sinai and the other Horeb. The tops of Horeb and Sinai have a very steep ascent, and do not stand upon much ground, in comparison to their extraordinary height: that of Sinai is at least one-third part higher than the other, and its ascent is more upright and difficult.\n\nTwo German miles and a half up the mountain stands Niebuhr's convent of St Catharine. The body of this monastery is a building 120 feet in length and almost as many in breadth. Before it stands another small building, in which is the only gate of the convent, which remains always shut, except when the bishop is here.\nhere. At other times, whatever is introduced within the convent, whether men or provisions, is drawn up by the roof in a basket, and with a cord and a pulley. The whole building is of hewn stone; which, in such a desert, must have cost prodigious expense and pains. Near this chapel rises a fountain of very good fresh water; it is looked upon as miraculous by some who cannot conceive how water can flow from the brow of so high and barren a mountain. Five or six paces from it they show a stone, the height of which is four or five feet, and breadth about three, which, they say, is the very stone whence Moses caused the water to gush out. Its colour is of a spotted grey, and it is as it were set in a kind of earth, where no other rock appears. This stone has 12 holes or channels, which are about a foot wide, whence it is thought the water came forth for the Israelites to drink.\n\nMuch has been said of the writings to be seen at Sinai and in the plain about it; and such were the hopes of discoveries respecting the wanderings of the Ishmaelites from these writings, that Dr. Clayton bishop of Clogher offered 500l. sterling to defray the expenses of journey to any man of letters who would undertake to copy them. No man, we believe, undertook this task; and the accurate Danish traveller Niebuhr found no writings there, but the names of persons who had visited the place from curiosity, and of Egyptians who had chosen to be buried in that region.\n\n**SINAPIS, MUSTARD**, a genus of plants belonging to the class *Tetradynamia*, and to the order *Filiflorae*; and in the natural system ranged under the 39th order, *Siliciflorae*. See Botany Index.\n\n**SINAPISM**, in Pharmacy, an external medicine, in form of a cataplasm, composed chiefly of mustard-seed pulverized, and other ingredients mentioned in the preceding article.\n\n**SINCERITY**, honesty of intention, freedom from hypocrisy. See Moral Philosophy, No. 157.\n\n**SINCIPUT**, in Anatomy, the forepart of the head, reaching from the forehead to the coronal future.\n\n**SINDY**, a province of Hindoof Proper, bounded on the west by Makran, a province of Persia; on the north by the territories of the king of Condahar; on the north-east by those of the Seiks; on the east by a sandy desert; and on the south-east by Cutela. It extends along the course of the river Sinde or Indus from its mouth to Behker or Bhakor, on the frontiers of Moultan. Reckoned that way, it is 300 miles long; and its breadth, in its widest part, is about 160. In many particulars of soil and climate, and in the general appearance of the surface, Sindy resembles Egypt; the lower part of it being composed of rich vegetable mould, and extended into a wide dell; while the upper part of it is a narrow strip of country, confined on one side by a ridge of mountains, and on the other by a sandy desert, the river Indus, equal at least to the Nile, winding through the midst of this level valley, and annually overflowing it. During great part of the south-west monsoon, or at least in the months of July, August, and part of September, which is the rainy season in most other parts of India, the atmosphere is here generally clouded; but no rain falls except very near the sea. Indeed, very few showers fall during the whole year; owing to which, and the neighbourhood of the sandy deserts, which bound it on the east and on the north-west, the heats are so violent, and the winds from those quarters so pernicious, that the houses are contrived so as to be occasionally ventilated by means of apertures on the tops of them, resembling the funnels of small chimneys. When the hot winds prevail, the windows are closely shut; and the lowest part of the current of air, which is always the hottest, being thus excluded, a cooler, because more elevated, part descends into the house through the funnels. By this contrivance also vast clouds of dust are excluded; the entrance of which would alone be sufficient to render the houses uninhabitable. The roofs are composed of thick layers of earth instead of terraces. Few countries are more unwholesome to European constitutions, particularly the lower part of the Delta. The prince of this province is a Mahometan, tributary to the king of Candahar. He resides at Hydrabad, although Tatta is the capital. The Hindoos, who were the original inhabitants of Sindy, are by their Mahometan governors treated with great rigour, and denied the public exercise of their religion; and this severity drives vast numbers of them into other countries. The inland parts of Sindy produce saltpetre, sal-ammoniac, borax, bezoor, lapis lazuli, and raw silk. They have also manufactories of cotton and silk of various kinds; and they make fine cabinets, inlaid with ivory, and finely lacquered. They also export great quantities of butter, clarified and wrapped up in duppas, made of the hides of cattle. The ladies wear hoops of ivory on both their arms and legs, which when they die are burnt with them. They have large black cattle, excellent mutton, and small hardy horses. Their wild game are deer, hares, antelopes, and foxes, which they hunt with dogs, leopards, and a small fierce creature called a shahgul.\n\n**SINE, or Right SINE of an Arch**, in Trigonometry, is a right line drawn from one end of that arch, perpendicular to the radius drawn to the other end of the arch; being always equal to half the chord of twice the arch. See Trigonometry and Geometry.\n\n**SINECURE**, a nominal office, which has a revenue without any employment.\n\n**SINEW**, a tendon, that which unites the muscles to the bones.\n\n**SINGING**, the action of making divers inflections of the voice, agreeable to the ear, and correspondent to the notes of a song or piece of melody. See Melody.\n\nThe first thing to be done in learning to sing, is to raise a scale of notes by tones and semitones to an octave, and descend by the same notes; and then to rise and fall by greater intervals, as a third, fourth, fifth, &c., and to do all this by notes of different pitch. Then these notes are represented by lines and spaces, to which the syllables fa, sol, la, mi, are applied, and the pupil taught to name each line and space thereby; whence this practice is called sol-faing, the nature, reason, effects, &c. thereof, see under the article Solfeaging.\n\n**Singing of Birds.** It is worthy of observation, that the female of no species of birds ever sings: with birds it is the reverse of what occurs in human kind. Among the feathered tribe, all the cares of life fall to the lot of the tender sex; theirs is the fatigue of incubation; and the principal share in nursing the helpless brood: to alleviate these fatigues, and to support her under them, nature hath given to the male the song, with all the little\nSINGULAR NUMBER, in Grammar, that number of nouns and verbs which stands opposed to plural. See GRAMMAR, No. 14.\n\nSINISTER, something on or towards the left hand. Hence some derive the word sinister à sinendo; because the gods, by such auguries, permit us to proceed in our designs.\n\nSINISTER, is ordinarily used among us for unlucky; though, in the sacred rites of divination, the Romans used it in an opposite sense. Thus avus sinistra, or a bird on the left hand, was esteemed a happy omen: whence, in the law of the 12 tables, Ave sinistra populi magister efla.\n\nSINISTER in Heraldry. The sinister side of an escutcheon is the left-hand side; the sinister chief, the left angle of the chief; the sinister base, the left-hand part of the base.\n\nSINISTER Aspect, among astrologers, is an appearance of two planets happening according to the succession of the signs; as Saturn in Aries, and Mars in the same degree of Gemini.\n\nSINISTRI, a set of ancient heretics, thus called because they held the left hand in abhorrence, and made it a point of religion not to receive any thing therein.\n\nSINKING FUND, a provision made by parliament, consisting of the surplusage of other funds, intended to be appropriated to the payment of the national debt; on the credit of which very large sums have been borrowed for public uses.\n\nAs the funding system had been adopted in other countries long before it was referred to in Great Britain, a provision of this kind had appeared necessary at a much earlier period, and had been established in Holland in 1655, and in the ecclesiastical states in 1685. These funds were both formed by the reduction of the interest on the public debts, and by appropriating the annual sum thus saved to the gradual discharge of the principal.\n\nIn the reign of King William, when the mode of providing for extraordinary expenses was first adopted in this country, the particular tax on which money was borrowed, generally produced much more than was sufficient to pay the annual interest, and the surplus was applied in sinking the principal, which was generally effected in a few years. Had this plan been pursued, there never could have been any great accumulation of public debts; but, as the expenditure increased, and the necessity of loans of still greater amount became more frequent, it was found difficult to provide for the annual interest of the sums thus borrowed; and the repayment of the principal was either put off to a distant period, or left without any provision to the chance of more flourishing times.\n\nSome of the effects of an accumulating public debt soon became evident in the discount at which all government securities sold, and in the difficulties experienced in providing for the annual expenditure; the propriety of reducing, and even of wholly discharging, the debt, was generally acknowledged; and the plan of a sinking fund was recommended in a pamphlet published in 1701. In 1713 Mr Archibald Hutchison presented to George I. a plan for payment of the public debts. In 1715 different projects for this purpose were published by Edward Leigh, Mr Algill, and others. And in 1717 a plan for the gradual discharge of the debt was actually adopted, which was afterwards generally known by the name of the sinking fund.\n\nFor a few years the fund was strictly applied to the purposes for which it was established; and so well were its nature and importance then understood, that money was at the same time borrowed for extraordinary expenses. In 1724, the sum of £5,144l. 19s. was taken from the fund, to make good the loss to the treasury from the reduction of the value of gold coin; and within 12 years from its establishment it was charged with the interest of new loans. In 1733, the gross sum of half a million was taken from it towards the supplies, at which time the medium annual produce of the fund for five years had been £1,212,000l. This amount would have fully discharged the debt which then existed, but the alienation of it was continued.\n\nThis was succeeded by the consolidated fund, one object of which was, to lay the foundation of a new sinking fund, and consisting, like the old one, in the application of the principle of compound interest. On this occasion Mr Pitt consulted the late Dr Price, who communicated three plans, one of which was afterwards adopted, but with such alterations as greatly affected its efficacy, and which it has been since found necessary to correct. By the act passed for carrying this scheme into execution, the annual sum of £1,000,000l. was placed in the hands of commissioners, to be issued in four equal quarterly payments, and to be applied either in paying off such redeemable annuities as were at or above par, or in the purchase of annuities below par, at the market-price.\n\nOn the 17th of February, 1792, Mr Pitt proposed that the sum of £400,000l. should be issued in addition to the million, for the purpose of accelerating the operation of the fund; and stated that it might be expected that 25 millions of 3 per cents would be paid off by the year 1800; and that in the year 1808, the fund would amount to £4,000,000l. per annum, the sum to which it was then restricted. The injudicious restriction of the fund to £4,000,000l. per annum, was done away by an act passed in 1802, which directed that the produce of the two funds should continue to accumulate, without any limitation as to its amount, and be from time to time applied, according to the former provisions, in the redemption or purchase of stock, until the whole of the perpetual redeemable annuities, existing at the time of passing the act, shall have been completely paid off. At the same time, the annual grant of £200,000l. in aid of the fund, was made a permanent charge, to be issued in quarterly payments from the consolidated fund, in the same manner as the original million per annum. In consequence of these improvements, the increase of the fund has been much greater than it was originally\nSinking originally estimated; and on the 1st of February, 1806, was as follows:\n\nAnnual charge by act of 26 Geo. III.\n\nDitto 42 Geo. III. L. 1,000,000\n\nAnnuities for 99 and 96 years, expired 1792\n\nShort annuities, expired 1787\n\nLife annuities, unclaimed and expired\n\nDividend on 98,386,402l. at 3 per cent.\n\nDitto on 2,617,400l. at 4 per cent.\n\nDitto on 14,000l. at 5 per cent.\n\nOne per cent. on capitals erected since 1723\n\nTotal, L. 7,596,249\n\nThis sum is exclusive of the fund for the reduction of the public debt of Ireland, which at the above period amounted to 479,937l. 8s. and of the fund for reduction of the imperial debt, which amounted to 56,960l. 9s. 4d.\n\nThe progress of the fund from the commencement of its operation on 1st August 1786, to the 1st February 1806, will appear from the following statement of the total amount of the stock redeemed by the commissioners up to the latter period.\n\nConsolidated 3 per cent. annuities\n\nReduced 3 per cent. annuities\n\nOld South sea annuities\n\nNew South sea annuities\n\nThree per cents 1751\n\nConsolidated 4 per cent. annuities\n\nNavy 5 per cent. annuities\n\nTotal, L. 101,145,302\n\nThe total sum which had been paid for this amount of stock was, 62,842,782l. 7s. 10d. the consolidated 3 per cents having been bought up on an average at 61l. per cent. and the reduced at somewhat less.\n\nThe progress already made by the fund, and the important effect it has had in supporting the value of the government securities at a time when it has been necessary to borrow unprecedented sums in almost every year, sufficiently demonstrate the great utility of this measure. As its increase will be continually augmenting, it will, if steadily persevered in, and faithfully applied, become ultimately capable of discharging a debt of any amount with which it is possible to suppose the country will ever be encumbered.\n\nSINOPLE, in Heraldry, denotes vert, or green colour in armories.—Sinople is used to signify love, youth, beauty, rejoicing, and liberty; whence it is that letters of grace, ambition, legitimation, &c. are always sealed with green wax.\n\nSINUOSITY, a series of bends and turns in arches or other irregular figures, sometimes jutting out and sometimes falling in.\n\nSINUS, in Anatomy, denotes a cavity in certain bones and other parts, the entrance whereof is very narrow, and the bottom wider and more spacious.\n\nSINUS, in Surgery, a little cavity or fæculus, frequently formed by a wound or ulcer, wherein pus is collected.\n\nSIPHON. See HYDRODYNAMICS.\n\nSIPHONANTHUS, a genus of plants belonging to the clas of tetrandria and order of monogynia. See BOTANY Index.\n\nSIPONTUM, SEPUNTUM, or SIPUS, in Ancient Geography, a town of Apulia, so denominated (according to Strabo) from the great quantity of sepia or cuttlefish that are thrown upon the coast. Diomedes is supposed by the same author to have been the founder of this place; which appears from Livy to have become a colony of Roman citizens. In the early ages of Christian hierarchy, a bishop was fixed in this church; but, under the Lombards, his see was united to that of Beneventum. Being again separated, Sipontum became an archiepiscopal diocese in 1094, about which time it was ill treated by the Barbarians, that it never recovered its splendour, but sunk into such misery, that in 1260 it was a mere desert, from the want of inhabitants, the decay of commerce, and the infalibility of the air. Manfred having taken these circumstances into consideration, began in 1261 to build a new city on the sea-shore, to which he removed the few remaining Sipontines. (See the article MANFREDONIA). Sipontum was situated at the distance of a mile from the shore. Excepting a part of its Gothic cathedral, scarce one stone of the ancient city now remains upon another.\n\nSIPUNCULUS, in Natural History, a genus of the clas of vermes, and order intestina. See HELMINTHOLOGY Index.\n\nSIR, the title of a knight or baronet, which, for distinction's sake, as it is now given indiscriminately to all men, is always prefixed to the knight's Christian name, either in speaking or writing to them.\n\nSIRCAR, any office under the government in Hindustan. It is sometimes used for the state of government itself. Likewise a province, or any number of parganas placed under one head in the government books, for convenience in keeping accounts. In common usage in Bengal, the under banyans of European gentlemen are called Sircars.\n\nSIRE, a title of honour formerly given to the king of France as a mark of sovereignty.\n\nSIRE, was likewise anciently used in the same sense with fleur and seigneur, and applied to barons, gentlemen, and citizens.\n\nSIRENS, in fabulous history, certain celebrated song-streles who were ranked among the demigods of antiquity. Hyginus places their birth among the consequences of the rape of Proserpine. Others make them daughters of the river Achelous and one of the muses. Some make them half women and half fish; others, half women and half birds. There are antique representations of them still subsisting under both these forms. Pausanias tells us, that the Sirens, by the persuasion of Juno, challenged the Muses to a trial of skill in singing; and these having vanquished them, plucked the golden feathers from the wings of the Sirens, and formed them into crowns.\ncrowsns, with which they adorned their own heads. The Argonauts are said to have been diverted from the enchantment of their songs by the superior strains of Orpheus: Ulysses, however, had great difficulty in securing himself from seduction. See Odysseus, lib. xii.\n\nPope, in his notes to the twelfth book of the Odyssey, observes, the critics have greatly laboured to explain what was the foundation of this fiction of the Sirens. We are told by some, that the Sirens were queens of certain small islands named Sirenusae, that lie near Capri in Italy, and chiefly inhabited the promontory of Minerva, upon the top of which that goddess had a temple, as some affirm, built by Ulysses. Here there was a renowned academy, in the reign of the Sirens, famous for eloquence and the liberal sciences, which gave occasion to the invention of this fable of the sweetness of the voice and attracting songs of the Sirens. But why then are they fabled to be destroyers, and painted in such dreadful colours? We are told, that at last the students abused their knowledge, to the colouring of wrong, the corruption of manners, and the subversion of government: that is, in the language of poetry, they were feigned to be transformed into monsters, and with their music to have enticed passengers to their ruin, who there consumed their patrimonies, and poisoned their virtues with riot and effeminacy. The place is now called Massa. Some writers tell us of a certain bay, contrived within winding straits and broken cliffs, which, by the singing of the winds and beating of the waters, returns a delightful harmony, that allures the passenger to approach, who is immediately thrown against the rocks, and swallowed up by violent eddies. Thus Horace, moralising, calls idleness a Siren.\n\n—Vitanda est improba Siren\n\nDefidia.\n\nBut the fable may be applied to all pleasures in general, which, if too eagerly pursued, betray the incautious into ruin; while wise men, like Ulysses, making use of their reason, stop their ears against their insinuations.\n\nThe learned Mr Bryant says, that the Sirens were Cuthite and Canaanitish priests, who had founded temples in Sicily, which were rendered infamous on account of the women who officiated. They were much addicted to cruel rites, so that the shores upon which they resided are described as covered with the bones of men destroyed by their artifice. Virgil, Aeneid, lib. v. ver. 864.\n\nAll ancient authors agree in telling us, that Sirens inhabited the coast of Sicily. The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician language, implies a song-firefly. Hence it is probable, says Dr Burney, that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on the coast of Sicily, who, by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable. And if this conjecture be well founded, he observes, the Muses are not the only pagan divinities who preserved their influence over mankind in modern times; for every age has its Sirens, and every Siren her votaries; when beauty and talents, both powerful in themselves, are united, they become still more attractive.\n\nSirex, in Zoology, a genus of animals belonging to the class of amphibia and the order of meantes. It is a biped, naked, and furnished with a tail; the feet are brachiated with claws. This animal was discovered by Dr Garden in Carolina; it is found in swampy and muddy places, by the sides of pools, under the trunks of old trees that hang over the water. The natives call it by the name of mud-inguana. Linnaeus first ap-voi. lvi. prehended, that it was the larva of a kind of lizard; p. 189. but as its fingers are furnished with claws, and it makes a croaking noise, he concluded from these properties, as well as from the situation of the anus, that it could not be the larva of the lizard, and therefore formed of it a new genus under the name of sirex. He was also obliged to establish for this uncommon animal a new order called meantes or gliders; the animals of which are amphibious, breathing by means of gills and lungs, and furnished with arms and claws.\n\nSirex, a genus of insects belonging to the order of hymenoptera. See Entomology Index.\n\nSirium, a genus of plants belonging to the class of tetrandra and order of monogynia. See Botany Index.\n\nSirius, in Astronomy, a bright star in the constellation Canis. See Astronomy, No. 423, &c.\n\nSirlet, Flavius, an eminent Roman engraver on precious stones; his Laocoön, and representations in miniature of antique statues at Rome, are very valuable and scarce. He died in 1737.\n\nSirocco, a periodical wind which generally blows in Italy and Dalmatia every year about Easter. It blows from the south-east by south; it is attended with heat, but not rain; its ordinary period is twenty days, Portus, and it usually ceases at sunset. When the sirocco does not blow in this manner, the summer is almost free from Dalmatian westerly winds, whirlwinds, and storms. This wind is injurious to plants, drying and burning up the buds; though it hurts not men any otherwise than by causing an extraordinary weakness and languor; inconveniences that are fully compensated by a plentiful sowing, and a good crop of corn on the mountains. In the summer time, when the westerly wind ceases for a day, it is a sign that the sirocco will blow the day following, which usually begins with a sort of whirlwind.\n\nSiskin. See Fringilla, Ornithology Index.\n\nSison, bastard stone parsley, a genus of plants belonging to the class of pentandra, and to the order of digyna; and in the natural system arranged under the 4th order, umbellatae. See Botany Index.\n\nSistrum, or Cistrum, a kind of ancient musical instrument used by the priests of Isis and Osiris. It is described by Spinoza as an oval form, in manner of a racket, with three sticks traversing it breadthwise; which playing freely by the agitation of the whole instrument, yielded a kind of sound which to them seemed melodious. Mr Malcom takes the sistrum to be no better than a kind of rattle. Ophelius observes, that the sistrum is found represented on several medals, and on tallifrons.\n\nSisymbrium, water-cresses, a genus of plants belonging to the class of tetradyamnia, and to the order of filigera; and in the natural system ranged under the 39th order, filigerae. See Botany Index.\n\nSisyphus, in fabulous history, one of the descendants of Eolus, married Merope, one of the Pleiades, who bore him Glaucus. He resided at Enyra in Peloponnesus, and was a very crafty man. Others say, that he was a Trojan secretary, who was punished for discovering\nvering secrets of state; and others again, that he was a notorious robber, killed by Theseus. However, all the poets agree that he was punished in Tartarus for his crimes, by rolling a great stone to the top of a hill, which constantly recoiled, and, rolling down incessantly, renewed his labour.\n\n**SISYRINCHIUM**, a genus of plants belonging to the class of *gynandria*, and order of *triandra*; and in the natural system ranged under the 5th order, *Enfate*. See Botany Index.\n\n**SITE**, denotes the situation of an house, &c. and sometimes the ground-plot or spot of earth on which it stands.\n\n**SITTA**, Nuthatch, a genus of birds belonging to the order of *picae*. See Ornithology Index.\n\n**SIOPHYLAX**, Σιοφυλαξ, formed from ὀρεός \"corn,\" and φυλάξ \"keeper,\" in antiquity, an Athenian magistrate, who had the superintendence of the corn, and was to take care that nobody bought more than was necessary for the provision of his family. By the Attic laws, particular persons were prohibited from buying more than fifty measures of wheat a man; and that such persons might not purchase more, the strophylax was appointed to see the laws properly executed. It was a capital crime to prevaricate in it. There were 15 of these strophylaces, ten for the city, and five for the Piraeus.\n\n**SITUS**, in Algebra and Geometry, denotes the situation of lines, surfaces, &c. Worius delivers some things in geometry, which are not deduced from common analysis, particularly matters depending on the situs of lines and figures. Leibnitz has even founded a particular kind of analysis upon it, called calculus situs.\n\n**SIVA**, a name given by the Hindoos to the Supreme Being, when considered as the avenger or destroyer. Sir William Jones has shown that in several respects the character of Jupiter and Siva are the same. As Jupiter overthrew the Titans and giants, so did Siva overthrow the Daityas, or children of Diti, who frequently rebelled against Heaven; and as during the contest the god of Olympus was furnished with lightning and thunderbolts by an eagle, so Brahma, who is sometimes represented riding on the Garuda, or eagle, presented the god of destruction with fiery shafts. Siva also corresponds with the Stygian Jove, or Pluto; for, if we can rely on a Persian translation of the Bhágavat, the sovereign of Pátála, or the infernal regions, is the king of serpents, named Sejhanaga, who is exhibited in painting and sculpture, with a diadem and sceptre, in the same manner as Pluto. There is yet another attribute of Siva, or Mahádeva, by which he is visibly distinguished in the drawings and temples of Bengal. To destroy, according to the Vedantis of India, the Siva of Persia, and many philosophers of our European schools, is only to generate and reproduce in another form. Hence the god of destruction is holden in this country to preside over generation, as a symbol of which he rides on a white bull. Can we doubt that the loves and feats of Jupiter Genitor (not forgetting the white bull of Europa), and his extraordinary title of Lapis, for which no satisfactory reason is commonly given, have a connection with the Indian philosophy and mythology?\n\n**SIUM**, Water Parsnip, a genus of plants belonging to the class of *pentandria*, and order of *dipynia*, and in the natural system ranging under the 44th order, *Umbellaceae*. See Botany Index.\n\n**SIWA**, or Siwah, a town in Egypt to the westward of Alexandria, built on a small fertile spot, surrounded on all sides by desert land. A considerable portion of this space is filled with date trees, but there are also plantains, pomegranates, figs, apricots, and olives; and the gardens are in a very flourishing condition. The people cultivate rice, which is of a reddish colour, and different from that of the delta. The rest of the land furnishes abundance of wheat for the consumption of the inhabitants.\n\nThe greatest curiosity about Siwa is a ruin of undoubted antiquity, measuring 32 feet in length, 18 in height, and 15 in breadth, which does not appear ever to have been much larger. Mr Horneman estimates the dimensions of it at 36 feet long, 24 feet wide, and 27 high, which agrees with no other traveller whatever; and indeed Mr Horneman himself allows that the jealousy of the natives prevented him from pursuing any plan of accurate examination or admeasurement. The people of Siwa have no tradition respecting this edifice, nor attribute any quality to it, but that of concealing treasures, and as the haunt of demons. It has, however, been supposed, that Siwa is the *Sirocum* of Pliny, and that this building was coeval with the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and a dependency on it; yet neither the natives of Siwa, nor the various tribes of Arabs who frequent that place, know any thing of the ruins of that temple, about which Mr Browne made every possible enquiry.\n\nThe complexion of the people of Siwa is generally darker than that of the Egyptians, and their dialect is also different. They do not habitually make use of snuff or tobacco. Their feet is that of Malik. The dress of the lower clas is very simple, as they are almost naked; among those whose costume was discernible, it approaches nearer to that of the Arabs of the desert than the Egyptians or Moors. Their clothing consists of a shirt of white cotton, with large sleeves reaching to the feet, a red cap without a turban, and shoes of the same colour. Some earthen ware made by themselves, and a few mats, form the chief part of their household furniture, none but the higher ranks being possessed of copper utensils. They sometimes purchase a few slaves from the Mourzouk caravan. The rest of their wants are supplied from Cairo or Alexandria, whither their dates are transported, both in a dry state, and beaten into maff, which, when good, greatly resembles a sweet meat. They do not eat large quantities of animal food, and bread known to us is uncommon. They drink plentifully of the liquor extracted from the date tree, which they call date-tree water, though it has frequently the power of inebriating in the state in which they drink it. Their animals are the hairy sheep and goat of Egypt, the afs, and a very small number of oxen and camels. The women wear veils as in Egypt. After the rains, the ground in the vicinity of Siwa is covered with salt for many weeks.\n\nSiwa has sometimes been compared to a bee hive, which it very much resembles, whether in respect to the general appearance of the eminence covered with buildings, the swarm of its people crowded together, or the confused noise, or hum and buzz from its narrow passages and streets, and which reach the ear at a considerable distance. North-west of the town there is a stratum of salt extending a full mile, and near it salt is found on\nthe surface. There are numerous springs, and frequently a spring of water perfectly sweet is found within a few paces of one that is salt. The people, according to Hornean, are obtrusive and thieves. Siwa is situated in 29° 14' N. Lat. and 44° 53' E. Long.\n\nSIX-CLERKS, officers in chancery of great account, next in degree below the twelve masters, whose business it is to enrol commissions, pardons, patents, warrants, &c., which pass the great seal, and to transact and file all proceedings by bill, answer, &c. They were anciently clerici, and forfeited their places, if they married; but when the constitution of the court began to alter, a law was made to permit them to marry, Stat. 14. and 15. Hen. VIII. cap. 8. They are also solicitors for parties in suits depending in the court of chancery. Under them are six deputies and 60 clerks, who, with the under clerks, do the business of the office.\n\nSIX NATIONS. See NIAGARA.\n\nSIXTH, in Music, one of the simple original concords, or harmonical intervals. See INTERVAL.\n\nSIXTUS V. POPE, was born the 13th December, 1521, in La Marca, a village in the feignory of Montalto. His father, Francis Peretti, was a gardener, and his mother a servant maid. He was their eldest child, and was called Felix. At the age of nine he was hired out to an inhabitant of the village to keep sheep; but disobliging his master, he was soon after degraded to be keeper of the hogs. He was engaged in this employment when Father Michael Angelo Selleri, a Franciscan friar, asked the road to Alcoli, where he was going to preach. Young Felix conducted him thither, and struck the father so much with his conversation and eagerness for knowledge, that he recommended him to the fraternity to which he had come. Accordingly he was received among them, invested with the habit of a lay brother, and placed under the sacristan, to assist in sweeping the church, lighting the candles, and other offices of that nature; for which he was to be taught the responses, and the rudiments of grammar. His progress in learning was so surprising, that at the age of 14 he was thought qualified to begin his novitiate, and was admitted the year following to make his profession.\n\nHe pursued his studies with such unwearied assiduity, that he was soon reckoned equal to the best disputants. He was ordained priest in 1545, when he assumed the name of Father Montalto; soon after he took his doctor's degree, and was appointed professor of theology at Sienna. It was then that he so effectually recommended himself to Cardinal di Carpi, and his secretary Boffius, that they ever remained his steady friends. Meanwhile the severity and obstinacy of his temper incessantly engaged him in disputes with his monastic brethren. His reputation for eloquence, which was now spread over Italy, about this time gained him some new friends. Among these were the Colonna family, and Father Ghislieri, by whose recommendation he was appointed inquisitor-general at Venice; but he exercised that office with so much severity, that he was obliged to flee precipitately from that city. Upon this he went to Rome, where he was made procurator-general of his order, and soon after accompanied Cardinal Buon Compagnon into Spain, as a chaplain and consultor to the inquisition. There he was treated with great respect, and liberal offers were made him to induce him to continue in Spain, which, however, he could not be prevailed on to accept.\n\nIn the mean time, news were brought to Madrid that Pius IV. was dead, and that Father Ghislieri, who had been made Cardinal Alexandrino by Paul IV., had succeeded him under the name of Pius V. These tidings filled Montalto with joy, and not without reason, for he was immediately invested by the pontiff with new dignities. He was made general of his order, bishop of St Agatha, was soon after raised to the dignity of cardinal, and received a pension. About this time he was employed by the pope to draw up the bill of excommunication against Queen Elizabeth.\n\nHe began now to cast his eyes upon the papacy; and, in order to obtain it, formed and executed a plan of hypocrisy with unparalleled constancy and success. He became humble, patient, and affable. He changed his dress, his air, his words, and his actions, so completely, that his most intimate friends declared him a new man. Never was there such an absolute victory gained over the passions; never was a fictitious character so long maintained, nor the foibles of human nature so artfully concealed. He courted the ambassadors of every foreign power, but attached himself to the interests of none; nor did he accept a single favour that would have laid him under any peculiar obligation. He had formerly treated his relations with the greatest tenderness, but he now changed his behaviour altogether. When his brother Anthony came to visit him, he lodged him in an inn, and sent him home next day, charging him to inform his family that he was now dead to his relations and the world.\n\nWhen Pius V. died in 1572, he entered the conclave with the other cardinals, but seemed altogether indifferent about the election, and never left his apartment except to his devotion. When solicited to join any party, he declined it, declaring that he was of no consequence, and that he would leave the choice of a pope entirely to persons of greater knowledge and experience. When Cardinal Buon Compagnon, who assumed the name of Gregory XIII., was elected, Montalto assured him that he never wished for anything so much in his life, and that he would always remember his goodness, and the favours he had conferred on him in Spain. But the new pope treated him with the greatest contempt, and deprived him of his pension. The cardinals also, deceived by his artifices, paid him no greater respect, and used to call him, by way of ridicule, the Roman beast; the afs of La Marca.\n\nHe now assumed all the infirmities of old age; his head hung down upon his shoulders; he tottered as he walked, and supported himself on a staff. His voice became feeble, and was often interrupted by a cough so exceedingly severe, that it seemed every moment to threaten his dissolution. He interfered in no public transactions, but spent his whole time in acts of devotion and benevolence. Mean time he constantly employed the ablest spies, who brought him intelligence of every particular.\n\nWhen Gregory XIII. died in 1585, he entered the conclave with the greatest reluctance, and immediately shut himself up in his chamber, and was no more thought of than if he had not existed. When he went\nSixtus, to mas, for which purpose alone he left his apartment, he appeared perfectly indifferent about the event of the election. He joined no party, yet flattered all.\n\nHe knew early that there would be great divisions in the conclave, and he was aware that when the leaders of the different parties were disappointed in their own views, they all frequently agreed in the election of some old and infirm cardinal, the length of whose life would merely enable them to prepare themselves sufficiently for the next vacancy. These views directed his conduct, nor was he mistaken in his hopes of success.\n\nThree cardinals, the leaders of opposite factions, being unable to procure the election which each of them wished, unanimously agreed to make choice of Montalto. When they came to acquaint him with their intention, he fell into such a violent fit of coughing that every person thought he would expire on the spot. He told them that his reign would last but a few days; that, besides a continual difficulty of breathing, he wanted strength to support such a weight, and that his small experience rendered him very unfit for so important a charge. He conjured them all three not to abandon him, but to take the whole weight of affairs upon their own shoulders; and declared that he would never accept the mitre upon any other terms: \"If you are resolved,\" added he, \"to make me pope, it will only be placing yourselves on the throne. For my part, I shall be satisfied with the bare title. Let the world call me pope, and I make you heartily welcome to the power and authority. The cardinals swallowed the bait, and exerted themselves to effectually that Montalto was elected. He now pulled off the mask which he had worn for 14 years. No sooner was his election secured, than he started from his seat, flung down his staff in the middle of the hall, and appeared almost a foot taller than he had done for several years.\n\nWhen he was asked, according to custom, if he would accept of the papacy, he replied, \"It is trifling to ask whether I will accept what I have already accepted.—However, to satisfy any scruple that may arise, I tell you that I accept it with great pleasure, and would accept another if I could get it; for I find myself able, by the Divine assistance, to manage two papacies.\" His former complaisance and humility disappeared, together with his infirmities, and he now treated all around him with reserve and haughtiness. The first care of Sixtus V. the name which Montalto assumed, was to correct the abuses, and put a stop to the enormities, which were daily committed in every part of the ecclesiastical state. The lenity of Gregory's government had introduced a general licentiousness of manners, which burst forth with great violence, after that pontiff's death. It had been usual with former popes to release delinquents on the day of their coronation, who were therefore accustomed to surrender themselves voluntary prisoners immediately after the election of the pope. At present, however, they were fatally disappointed.—When the governor of Rome and the keeper of St Angelo waited on his Holiness, to know his intention in this particular, he replied, \"What have you to do with pardons, and releasing of prisoners? Is it not sufficient that our predecessor has suffered the judges to remain unemployed these 13 years? Shall we also slay our pontificate with the same neglect of justice? We have too long seen, with inexpressible concern, the prodigious degree of wickedness that reigns in the state, to think of granting pardons. Let the prisoners be brought to a speedy trial, and punished as they deserve, to show the world that Divine Providence has called us to the chair of St Peter, to reward the good, and chastise the wicked; that we bear not the sword in vain, but are the ministers of God, and a revenger to execute wrath on them that do evil.\"\n\nHe appointed commissioners to inspect the conduct of the judges, displaced those who were inclined to lenity, and put others of severe dispositions in their room. He offered rewards to any person who could convict them of corruption or partiality. He ordered the syndics of all the towns and signories to make out a complete list of the disorderly persons within their districts, and threatened the strappado for the smallest omission. In consequence of this edict, the syndic of Albino was scourged in the market-place, because he had left his nephew, an incorrigible libertine, out of his list.\n\nHe made very severe laws against robbers and assassins. Adulterers, when discovered, suffered death; and they who willingly submitted to the prostitution of their wives, a custom then common in Rome, received the same punishment. He was particularly careful of the purity of the female sex, and never forgave those who attempted to debauch them.\n\nHis execution of justice was as prompt as his edicts were rigorous. A Swiss happening to give a Spanish gentleman a blow with his halberd, was struck by him rudely with a pilgrim's staff that he expired on the spot. Sixtus informed the governor of Rome that he was to dine early, and that justice must be executed on the criminal before he sat down to table. The Spanish ambassador and four cardinals intreated him not to disgrace the gentleman by suffering him to die on a gibbet, but to order him to be beheaded. \"He shall be hanged (replied Sixtus), but I will alleviate his disgrace by doing him the honour to attend personally at his death.\" He ordered a gibbet to be erected before his own windows, where he continued sitting during the whole execution. He then called to his servants to bring in dinner, declaring that the act of justice which he had just seen had increased his appetite. When he rose from table, he exclaimed, \"God be praised for the good appetite with which I have dined!\"\n\nWhen Sixtus ascended the throne, the whole ecclesiastical state was infested with bands of robbers, who from their numbers and outrages, were exceedingly formidable; by his prudent and vigorous conduct, however, he in a short time extirpated the whole of these banditti.\n\nNor was the vigour of his conduct less conspicuous in his transactions with foreign nations. Before he had been pope two months he quarrelled with Philip II. of Spain, Henry III. of France, and Henry king of Navarre. His intrigues indeed in some measure influenced all the councils of Europe.\n\nAfter his accession to the pontificate he sent for his family to Rome, with express orders that they should appear in a decent and modest manner. Accordingly, his sister Camilla came thither, accompanied by her daughter and two grandchildren. Some cardinals, in order to pay court to the pope, went out to meet her, and introduced her in a very magnificent dress. Sixtus pretended not to know her, and asked two or three times:\ntimes who she was: Upon this one of the cardinals said, \"It is your sister, holy father,\" \"I have but one sister\" (replied Sixtus with a frown), and she is a poor woman at Le Grotte; if you have introduced her in this disguise, I declare I do not know her; yet I think I would know her again, if I saw her in the clothes she used to wear.\"\n\nHer conductors at last found it necessary to carry her to an inn, and strip her of her finery. When Camilla was introduced a second time, Sixtus embraced her tenderly, and said, \"Now we know indeed that it is our sister: nobody shall make a princess of you but ourselves.\" He stipulated with his sister, that she should neither ask any favour in matters of government, nor intercede for criminals, nor interfere in the administration of justice; declaring that every request of that kind would meet with a certain refusal. These terms being agreed to, and punctually observed, he made the most ample provision not only for Camilla but for his whole relations.\n\nThis great man was also an encourager of learning. He caused an Italian translation of the Bible to be published, which raised a good deal of discontent among the Catholics. When some cardinals reproached him for his conduct in this respect, he replied, \"It was published for the benefit of you cardinals who cannot read Latin.\"\n\nSixtus died in 1597, after having reigned little more than five years. His death was ascribed to poison, said to have been administered by the Spaniards; but the story seems rather improbable.\n\nIt was to the indulgence of a disposition naturally formed for severity, that all the defects of this wonderful man are to be ascribed. Clemency was a stranger to his bosom; his punishments were often too cruel, and seemed sometimes to border on revenge. Pasquin was dressed one morning in a very nasty shirt, and being asked by Marforio why he wore such dirty linen? replied, that he could get no other, for the pope had made his washerwoman a princess, alluding to Camilla, who had formerly been a laundress. The pope ordered strict search to be made for the author of this lampoon, and offered him his life and a thousand pistoles if he would discover himself. The author was simple enough to make his appearance and claim the reward. \"It is true (said the pope) we made such a promise, and we shall keep it; your life shall be spared, and you shall receive the money presently: but we have referred to ourselves the power of cutting off your hands and boring your tongue through, to prevent your being so witty for the future.\" It is needless to add, that the sentence was immediately executed. This, however, is the only instance of his resenting the many severe satires that were published against him.\n\nBut though the conduct of Sixtus seldom excites love, it generally commands our esteem, and sometimes our admiration. He strenuously defended the cause of the poor, the widow, and the orphan: he never refused audience to the injured, however wretched or forlorn their appearance was. He never forgave those magistrates who were capable of partiality or corruption; nor suffered crimes to pass unpunished, whether committed by the rich or the poor. He was frugal, temperate, sober, and never neglected to reward the smallest favour which had been conferred on him before his exaltation.\n\nWhen he mounted the throne, the treasury was not only exhausted, but in debt: at his death it contained five millions of gold.\n\nRome was indebted to him for several of her greatest embellishments, particularly the Vatican library: it was by him, too, that trade was first introduced into the Ecclesiastical State.\n\nSIYA-GHUSH, the caracal of Buffon, an animal of the cat kind. See Felis, Mammalia Index.\n\nSIZAR, or SIZER, in Latin Sizator, an appellation by which the lowest order of students in the universities of Cambridge and Dublin are distinguished, is derived from the word size, which in Cambridge, and probably in Dublin likewise, has a peculiar meaning. To size, in the language of the university, is to get any sort of victuals from the kitchens, which the students may want in their own rooms, or in addition to their commons in the hall, and for which they pay the cooks or butchers at the end of each quarter. A size of anything is the smallest quantity of that thing which can be thus bought: two sizes, or a part of beef, being nearly equal to what a young person will eat of that dish at dinner; and a size of ale or beer being equal to half an English pint.\n\nThe sizars are divided into two classes, viz. subfizators or sizars, and fizators or proper sizars. The former of these are supplied with commons from the table of the fellows and fellow commoners; and in former times, when these were more scanty than they are now, they were obliged to supply the deficiency by sizing, as is sometimes the case still. The proper sizars had formerly no commons at all, and were therefore obliged to size the whole. In St John's college they have now some commons allowed them for dinner, from a benefaction, but they are still obliged to size their suppers: in the other colleges they are allowed a part of the fellow-commons, but must size the rest; and from being thus obliged to size the whole or part of their victuals, the whole order derived the name of sizars.\n\nIn Oxford, the order similar to that of sizar is denominated servitor, a name evidently derived from the menial duties which they perform. In both universities these orders were formerly distinguished by round caps and gowns of different materials from those of the pensioners or commoners, the order immediately above them. But about 30 years ago the round cap was entirely abolished in both seminaries. There is still, however, in Oxford, we believe, a distinction in the gowns, and there is also a trifling difference in some of the small colleges in Cambridge; but in the largest colleges the dress of the pensioners and sizars is entirely the same.\n\nIn Oxford, the servitors are still obliged to wait at table on the fellows and gentlemen-commoners; but much to the credit of the university of Cambridge, this most degrading and disgraceful custom was entirely abolished about 10 or 12 years ago, and of course the sizars of Cambridge are now on a much more respectable footing than the servitors of Oxford.\n\nThe sizars are not upon the foundation, and therefore while they continue sizars are not capable of being elected.\nelected fellows; but they may at any time, if they choose, become pensioners; and they generally fit for scholarships immediately before they take their first degree. If successful, they are then on the foundation, and are entitled to become candidates for fellowships when they have got that degree. In the mean time, while they continue fizar, besides free commons they enjoy many benefactions, which have been made at different times, under the name of fizar's prætor, exhibitions, &c. and the rate of tuition, the rent of rooms, and other things of that sort within their respective colleges, is less than to the other orders. But though their education is thus obtained at a less expense, they are not now considered as a menial order; for fizar, pensioner-scholars, and even sometimes fellow-commoners, mix together with the utmost cordiality. It is worthy of remark, that at every period this order has supplied the university with its most distinguished officers; and that many of the most illustrious members of the church, many of the most distinguished men in the other liberal professions, have, when undergraduates, been fizar, when that order was on a less respectable footing than it is now.\n\nSIZE, the name of an instrument used for finding the bigness of fine round pearls. It consists of thin pieces or leaves, about two inches long, and half an inch broad, fastened together at one end by a rivet. In each of these are round holes drilled of different diameters. Those in the first leaf serve for measuring pearls from half a grain to seven grains; those of the second, for pearls from eight grains or two carats to five carats, &c.; and those of the third, for pearls from six carats and a half to eight carats and a half.\n\nSIZE, is also a sort of paint, varnish, or glue, used by painters, &c.\n\nThe threads and parings of leather, parchment, or vellum, being boiled in water and strained, make size. This substance is much used in many trades.—The manner of using size is to melt some of it over a gentle fire; and scraping as much whiting into it as will just colour it, let them be well incorporated together; after which you may whiten frames, &c. with it. After it dries, melt the size again, and put more whiting, and whiten the frames, &c. seven or eight times, letting it dry between each time: but before it is quite dry, between each rubbing with size, you must smooth and wet it over with a clean brush-pencil in fair water.\n\nTo make gold-size. Take gum-anime and saltpetre, of each one ounce; minium, litharge of gold, and amber, of each half an ounce: reduce all into a very fine powder, and add to them four ounces of linseed oil, and eight ounces of drying oil: digest them over a gentle fire that does not flame, so that the mixture may only simmer, but not boil; lest it should run over and set the house on fire, stir it constantly with a flisk till all the ingredients are dissolved and incorporated, and do not leave off stirring till it becomes thick and ropy; after being sufficiently boiled, let it stand till it is almost cold, and then strain it through a coarse linen cloth, and keep it for use.—To prepare it for working, put what quantity you please in a horse-muscle shell, adding as much oil of turpentine as will dissolve it; and making it as thin as the bottom of your feed-lac varnish, hold it over a candle, and then strain it through a linen-rag into another shell; add to these as much vermilion as will make it of a darkish red: if it is too thick for drawing, you may thin it with some oil of turpentine. The chief use of this size is for laying on metals.\n\nThe best gold size for burnishing is made as follows: Take fine hole, what quantity you please; grind it finely on a piece of marble, then scrape into it a little beef fat; grind all well together; after which mix in a small proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water, and it is done.\n\nTo make silver-size. Take tobacco-pipe clay in fine powder, into which scrape some black-lead and a little Genoa soap, and grind them all together with parchment size as already directed.\n\nSKATING, an exercise on ice, both graceful and healthy. Although the ancients were remarkable for their dexterity in most of the athletic sports, yet skating seems to have been unknown to them. It may therefore be considered as a modern invention; and probably it derived its origin in Holland, where it was practised, not only as a graceful and elegant amusement, but as an expeditious mode of travelling when the lakes and canals were frozen up during winter. In Holland long journeys are made upon skates with ease and expedition; but in general less attention is there paid to graceful and elegant movements, than to the expedition and celerity of what is called journey skating. It is only in those countries where it is considered as an amusement, that its graceful attitudes and movements can be studied; and there is no exercise whatever better calculated to set off the human figure to advantage. The acquirement of most exercises may be attained at an advanced period of life; but to become an expert skater, it is necessary to begin the practice of the art at a very early age. It is difficult to reduce the art of skating to a system. It is principally by the imitation of a good skater that a young practitioner can form his own practice. The English, though often remarkable for feats of agility upon skates, are very deficient in gracefulness: which is partly owing to the construction of the skates. They are too much curved in the surface which embraces the ice, consequently they involuntarily bring the users of them round on the outside upon a quick and small circle; whereas the skater, by using skates of a different construction, less curved, has the command of his stroke, and can enlarge or diminish the circle according to his own wish and desire. The metropolis of Scotland has produced more instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other country whatever; and the institution of a skating club about 50 years ago, has contributed not a little to the improvement of this elegant amusement. We are indebted for this article to a gentleman of that club, who has made the practice and improvement of skating his particular study; and as the nature of our work will not permit the insertion of a full treatise on skating, we shall present our readers with a few instructions.\n\nThose who wish to be proficient should begin at an early period of life; and should first endeavour to throw off the fear which always attends the commencement of an apparently hazardous amusement. They will soon acquire a facility of moving on the inside: when they have done this, they must endeavour to acquire the movement on the outside of the skates; which is nothing more than throwing themselves upon the outer edge of the skate, and making the balance of their body tend towards\ntowards that side, which will necessarily enable them to form a semicircle. In this, much assistance may be derived from placing a bag of lead-shot in the pocket next to the foot employed in making the outside stroke, which will produce an artificial poise of the body, which afterwards will become natural by practice. At the commencement of the outside stroke, the knee of the employed limb should be a little bended, and gradually brought to a rectilineal position when the stroke is completed. When the practitioner becomes expert in forming the semicircle with both feet, he is then to join them together, and proceed progressively and alternately with both feet, which will carry him forward with a graceful movement. Care should be taken to use very little muscular exertion, for the impelling motion should proceed from the mechanical impulse of the body thrown into such a position as to regulate the stroke. At taking the outside stroke, the body ought to be thrown forward easily, the unemployed limb kept in a direct line with the body, and the face and eyes directly looking forward; the unemployed foot ought to be stretched towards the ice, with the toes in a direct line with the leg. In the time of making the curve, the body must be gradually, and almost imperceptibly, raised, and the unemployed limb brought in the same manner forward; so that, at finishing the curve, the body will bend a small degree backward, and the unemployed foot will be about two inches before the other, ready to embrace the ice and form a correspondent curve. The muscular movement of the whole body must correspond with the movement of the skate, and should be regulated so as to be almost imperceptible to the spectators. Particular attention should be paid in carrying round the head and eyes with a regular and imperceptible motion; for nothing so much diminishes the grace and elegance of skating as sudden jerks and exertions, which are too frequently used by the generality of skaters. The management of the arms likewise deserves attention. There is no mode of disposing of them more gracefully in skating outside, than folding the hands into each other, or using a muff.\n\nThere are various feats of activity and manoeuvres used upon skates; but they are so various that we cannot pretend to detail them. Moving on the outside is the primary object for a skater to attain; and when he becomes an adept in that, he will easily acquire a facility in executing other branches of the art. There are few exercises but will afford him hints of elegant and graceful attitudes. For example, nothing can be more beautiful than the attitude of drawing the bow and arrow whilst the skater is making a large circle on the outside: the manual exercise and military salutes have likewise a pretty effect when used by an expert skater.\n\nSKELETON, in Anatomy, the dried bones of any animal joined together by wires, or by the natural ligament dried, in such a manner as to show their position when the creature was alive.\n\nWe have, in the Philosophical Transactions, an account of a human skeleton, all the bones of which were so united, as to make but one articulation from the back to the os sacrum, and downwards a little way. On sawing some of them, where they were unnaturally joined, they were found not to cohere throughout their whole substance, but only about a sixth of an inch deep all round. The figure of the trunk was crooked, the spine making the convex, and the inside of the vertebrae the concave part of the segment. The whole had been found in a charnel-house, and was of the size of a full grown person.\n\nSKIDS, or SKEEDS, in sea-language, are long compressing pieces of timber, notched below so as to fit closely upon the wales, extending from the main-wale to the top of the side, and retained in this position by bolts or spike-nails. They are intended for preserving the planks of the side, when any heavy body is hoisted or lowered.\n\nSKIE, ISLE OF. See SKYE.\n\nSKIFF, a small boat resembling a yawl, usually employed for patting rivers.\n\nSKIMMER, BLACK.

See BOTANY Index.\n\nSKIN, in Anatomy, the general covering of the body of any animal. See ANATOMY, No. 74.\n\nSKIN, in Commerce, is particularly used for the membrane stripped off the animal to be prepared by the tanner, skinner, parchment-maker, &c., and converted into leather, &c. See TANNING.\n\nSKINNER, STEPHEN, an English antiquarian, was born in 1622. He travelled, and studied in several foreign universities during the civil wars; and in 1634, returned and settled at Lincoln, where he practised physic with success until the year 1667, when he died of a malignant fever. His works were collected in folio in 1671, by Mr Henshaw, under the title of Etymologicum Linguae Anglicanae, &c.\n\nSKIPPER, or SAURY, a species of fish. See ESOX, Ichthyology Index.\n\nSKIRMISH, in War, a slight engagement between small parties, without any regular order; and is therefore easily distinguished from a battle, which is a general engagement between two armies continued for some time.\n\nSKIRMISH Bay, the name given by Lieutenant Broughton to a bay in an island which was discovered by him in latitude 43° 48' south, and in longitude 183° east. The Chatham armed tender worked up into the bay, and came to anchor about a mile from the shore. When the captain and some of the people landed, they found the natives so extremely inhospitable, that self-preservation made it necessary to fire upon them. The land is of considerable magnitude, whether island or continent, and what they saw of it extended nearly 40 miles from east to west, and the appearance of the country they regarded as very promising. The natives resemble those of New Zealand, from which they are distant about 100 leagues, but their skins were destitute of any marks, and they seemed to be cleanly in their persons. Their dresses were of seal skin, while some had fine mats fastened round the waist. Mr Broughton says, \"on our first landing, their surpise and exclamations can hardly be imagined; they pointed to the sun, and then to us, as if to ask whether we had come from thence?\" The arms they made use of were clubs, spears, and a small weapon resembling the patoo of New Zealand.\n\nSKULL, in Anatomy, the bony case in which the brain is enclosed. See ANATOMY, No. II, &c.\nSKY, the blue expanse of air or atmosphere. For the reason of its blue colour and concave figure, see Optics, No. 223.\n\nSKYE, one of the greatest of the Western islands of Scotland, so called from Skianach, which in the Erse dialect signifies winged, because the two promontories of Valernesh and Toternith, by which it is bounded on the north-west and north-east, are supposed to resemble wings. The island lies between the shire of Ross and the western part of Lewis. According to the computation of Mr Pennant, Dr Johnson, and Dr Campbell, it is 62 miles in length, and nearly the same in width where broadest; according to others it is 50 miles in length, and in some places 30 broad. The island of Skye was formerly divided between two proprietors; the southern part belonged to the laird of Macleod, said to be lineally descended from Leod son to the black prince of Man, but part of this division has fallen into other hands; the northern district is the property of Lord Macdonald, whose ancestor was Donald, king or lord of the isles, and chief of the numerous clan of Macdonalds, who are counted the most warlike of all the Highlanders. Skye is part of the shire of Inverness, and formerly belonged to the diocese of the isles: on the south it is parted from the main land by a channel three leagues in breadth; though, at the ferry of Glenelg, it is so narrow that a man may be heard calling for the boat from one side to the other. Skye is well provided with a variety of excellent bays and harbours.\n\nThe face of the country is roughened with mountains, some of which are so high as to be covered with snow on the top at midsummer; in general, their sides are clothed with heath and grass, which afford good pasture for sheep and black cattle. Between the mountains there are some fertile valleys, and the greater part of the land towards the sea-coast is plain and arable. The island is well watered with a great number of rivers, above 30 of which afford salmon; and some of them produce black mussels in which pearls are bred, particularly the rivers Kilmartin and Ord. Martin was assured by the proprietor of the former, that a pearl had been found in it valued at 20l. Sterling. Here is also a considerable number of fresh-water lakes well stored with trout and eels. The largest of these lakes takes its denomination from St Columba, to whom is dedicated a chapel that stands upon a small isle in the middle of the lake. Skye likewise affords several cataracts, that roar down the rocks with great impetuosity. That the island has been formerly covered with woods, appears from the large trunks of fir and other trees daily dug out of the bogs and peat-marches in every part of the country.\n\nFrom the height of the hills, and proximity of the sea, the air seldom continues long of the same temperature; sometimes it is dry, oftener moist, and in the latter end of winter and beginning of spring cold and piercing; at an average, three days in twelve throughout the year scarcely free from rain, far less from clouds. These, attracted by the hills, sometimes break in useful and refreshing showers; at other times suddenly bursting, pour down their contents with tremendous noise, in impetuous torrents that deluge the plains below, and render the smallest rivulet impassable; which, together with the stormy winds so common in this country in the months of August and September, frequently blast the hopes, and disappoint the expectations, of the husbandman. Snow has been often known to lie on the ground from three to seven weeks; and on the highest hills, even in the middle of June, some spots of it are to be seen. To this various temperature of the air, and uncertainty of weather, the fevers and agues, headaches, rheumatisms, colds, and dysenteries, which are the prevailing distempers, may be ascribed. That it is far, however, from being unwholesome, is sufficiently evinced by experience; for the inhabitants are, in general, as strong and healthy, and arrive at as advanced an age, as those who live in milder climates, and under a fitter sky. The gout is scarcely known in this island.\n\nThe soil is generally black, though it likewise affords clay of different colours; such as white, red, and blue, and in some places fuller's earth. It is, however, much less adapted for agriculture than for pasture, and seldom, unless in very good years, supplies itself with a sufficiency of provisions. Yet, though the soil is not very fertile or rich, it might with proper management be made to produce more plentiful crops. But the generality of the farmers are so prejudiced in favour of old customs, and indeed so little inclined to industry, that they will not easily be prevailed on to change them for better; especially if the alteration or amendment proposed be attended with expense. Therefore, with respect to improvements in agriculture, they are still much in the same state as they were 20 or 30 years ago. Ploughs, on a new and improved model, that in comparison to the advantages derived from them might be had at a moderate expense, have lately been introduced into several districts around, where their good effects are manifest in improving the crops and diminishing the labour of man and beast; but the laird of Raafay and one other gentleman are the only persons in Portree that have used them. The co/rovin, a crooked kind of spade, is almost the only instrument for labouring the ground used among the ordinary class of tenants. The average crops of corn are 8000 bolls.\n\nWhen Mr Knox visited this island in 1786, the number of inhabitants amounted to 15,000; but between 1790-98, according to the Statistical History of Scotland, the population is only 14,470.\n\nVarious minerals are found in Skye, but none have been brought to any advantage. Near the village of Sartle, the natives find black and white marbles, and variegated pebbles. The Applecrag, in the neighbourhood of Lochfallart, produces beautiful agates of different colours: stones of a purple hue are, after great rains, found in the rivulets: crystal, of different colours and forms, abounds in several parts of the island, as well as black and white marble, freestone, lime-stone, and talc: small red and white coral is found on the southern and western coasts in great abundance. The fuel consists chiefly of peat and turf, which are impregnated with iron ore; and coal has been discovered in several districts; but it does not appear to be worth working.\n\nThe wild birds of all sorts most common in the country, are, fowl, geese, gulls, cormorants, cranes, wild geese, and wild ducks; eagles, crows, ravens, rooks, cuckoos, rails, woodcocks, moor-fowl, partridges, plover, wild pigeons, and blackbirds, owls, hawks, knipes, and\na variety of small birds. In mild seasons, the cuckoo and rail appear in the latter end of April; the former disappears always before the end of June; the latter sometimes not till September. The woodcock comes in October, and frequently remains till March. The tame fowls of fowl are geese, ducks, turkeys, cocks, pullets, and tame pigeons.\n\nThe black cattle are here exposed to all the rigours of the severe winter, without any other provender than the tops of the heath and the alga marina; so that they appear like mere skeletons in the spring; though, as the grass grows up, they soon become plump and juicy, the beef being sweet, tender, and finely interlarded.—The amphibious animals are seals and otters. Among the reptiles may be reckoned vipers, afsps, frogs, toads, and three different kinds of serpents; the first spotted black and white, and very poisonous; the second yellow, with brown spots; and the third of a brown colour, the smallest and least poisonous.\n\nWhales, and cairnans or fun-fish, come in sometimes to the sounds after their prey, but are rarely pursued with any success. The fishes commonly caught on the coast are herrings, ling, cod, skate, haddock, mackerel, lythe, eye, and dog-fish. The average price of ling at home is £1. 13s. per ton; when sold, one by one, if fresh, the price is from 3d. to 5d.; if cured, from 3d. to 7d. The barrel of herrings seldom sells under 19s., which is owing to the great difficulty of procuring salt, even sometimes at any price; and the same cause prevents many from taking more than are sufficient for their own use.\n\nThe kyle of Scalpe teems with oysters, in such a manner, that after some spring-tides, 20 horse-loads of them are left upon the sands. Near the village of Bernsill, the beach yields mussels sufficient to maintain 60 persons per day; this providential supply helps to support many poor families in times of scarcity.\n\nThe people are strong, robust, healthy, and prolific. They generally profess the Protestant religion; are honest, brave, innocent, and hospitable. They speak the language, wear the habit, and observe the customs that are common to all the Hebrides. The meconium in new-born infants is purged away with fresh butter: the children are bathed every morning and evening in water, and grow up so strong, that a child of 10 months is able to walk alone: they never wear shoes or stockings before the age of eight or ten, and night-caps are hardly known; they keep their feet always wet; they lie on beds of straw or heath, which last an excellent restorative: they are quick of apprehension, ingenious, and very much addicted to music and poetry. They eat heartily of fish; but seldom regale themselves with flesh-meat: their ordinary food consists of butter, cheese, milk, potatoes, colewort, brochan, and a dish called oon, which indeed is no other than the froth of boiled milk or whey raised with a stick like that used in making chocolate.\n\nA sort of coarse woollen cloth called eloa, or caddoes, the manufacture of their wives, made into short jackets and trousers, is the common dress of the men. The philibeg is rarely worn, except in summer and on Sundays; on which days, and some other occasions, those in better circumstances appear in tartans, a bonnet, and short hose, and some in a hat, short coat, waistcoat, and breeches, of Scotch or English manufacture. The women are in general very cleanly, and so excessively fond of dress, that many maid-servants are often known to lay out their whole wages that way.\n\nThere are two fairs held annually at Portree, to which almost every part of Skye sends cattle. The first is held in the end of May, and the second in the end of July. The fair commonly continues from Wednesday till the Saturday following. The commodities which are sold in these are horses, cows, sheep, goats, hides, butter, cheese, fish, and wool. The cattle sold in these fairs swim over to the mainland through a mile or half a mile of sea. Thousands of these are yearly exported, at from 2l. to 3l. each. Many of them are driven to England, where they are fattened for the market, and counted delicious eating.\n\nIn Skye appear many ruins of Danish forts, watchtowers, beacons, temples, and sepulchral monuments. All the forts are known by the term Dun; such as Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skerinefs, Dun-David, &c.\n\nSKY-COLOUR. To give this colour to glass, set in the furnace a pot of pure metal of frit from rosetta or barilla, but the rosetta frit does best; as soon as the metal is well purified, take for a pot of twenty pounds of metal fix ounces of bras calcined by itself; put it by degrees at two or three times into the metal, stirring and mixing it well every time, and diligently skimming the metal with a ladle: at the end of two hours the whole will be well mixed, and a proof may be taken; if the colour be found right, let the whole stand 24 hours longer in the furnace, and it will then be fit to work, and will prove of a most beautiful sky colour.\n\nSLAB, an outside fappy plank or board sawed off from the sides of a timber-tree. The word is also used for a flat piece of marble.\n\nSLACK-LINE, in sea-language, a small cord passing up behind a ship's main-tail, or fore-tail, and being reved through a block attached to the lower part of the yard, is thence transmitted in two branches to the foot of the tail, to which it is fastened. It is used to truss up the sail as occasion requires, and more particularly for the convenience of the pilot or steersman, that they may look forward beneath it as the ship advances.\n\nSLACK-WATER, in sea-language, denotes the interval between the flux and reflux of the tide, or between the half of the ebb and the first of the flood, during which the current is interrupted, and the water apparently remains in a state of rest.\n\nSLACKEN, in Metallurgy, a term used by miners to express a spongy and semifluid substance which is mixed with the ores of metals, to prevent their fusion. It is the scoria or scum separated from the surface of the former fusions of metals. To this is frequently added limestone, and sometimes a kind of coarse iron-ore, in the running of the poorer gold ores.\n\nSLATE, a stone of a compact texture and laminated structure, splitting into fine plates, some varieties of which are employed for covering houses. See Clay-Slate, under Mineralogy, p. 185. See also Geology.\n\nSLAVE. See SLAVERY.\n\nSLAVERY is a word, of which though generally understood, it is not easy to give a proper definition. An excellent moral writer has defined it to be \"an obligation to labour for the benefit of the master, without the contract or consent of the servant.\" But may not he\nSlavery.\n\nbe properly called a slave who has given up his freedom to discharge a debt which he could not otherwise pay, or who has thrown it away at a game of hazard? In many nations, debts have been legally discharged in this manner; and in some savage tribes, such is the universal ardour for gaming, that it is no uncommon thing for a man, after having lost at play all his other property, to stake, on a single throw of dice, himself, his wife, and his children (a). That persons who have thus lost their liberty are slaves, will hardly be denied; and surely the infatuated gambler is a slave by his own contract. The debtor, too, if he was aware of the law, and contracted debts larger than he could reasonably expect to be able to pay, may justly be considered as having come under an obligation to labour for the benefit of a master with his own consent; for every man is answerable for all the known consequences of his voluntary actions.\n\nThis definition of slavery seems to be defective as well as inaccurate. A man may be under an obligation to labour through life for the benefit of a master, and yet that master have no right to dispose of him by sale, or in any other way to make him the property of a third person; but the word slave, as used among us, always denotes a person who may be bought and sold like a beast in the market (b). In its original sense, indeed, it was of the same import with noble, illustrious; but vast numbers of the people among whom it had that signification being, in the decline of the Roman empire, sold by their countrymen to the Venetians, and by them dispersed over all Europe, the word slave came to denote a person in the lowest state of servitude, who was considered as the absolute property of his master. See PHILOLOGY, No. 220.\n\nAs nothing can be more evident than that all men have, by the law of nature, an equal right to life, liberty, and the produce of their own labour (see RIGHT, No. 5.), it is not easy to conceive what can have first led one part of them to imagine that they had a right to enslave another. Inequalities of rank are indeed inevitable in civil society; and from them results that servitude which is founded in contract, and is of temporary duration. (See MORAL PHILOSOPHY, No. 141.) He who has much property has many things to attend to, and must be disposed to hire persons to assist and serve him; while those who have little or no property must be equally willing to be hired for that purpose. And if the master be kind, and the servant faithful, they will both be happier in this connection than they could have been out of it. But from a state of servitude, where the slave is at the absolute disposal of his master in all things, and may be transferred without his own consent from one proprietor to another, like an ox or an ass, happiness must be for ever banished. How then came a traffic so unnatural and unjust as that of slaves to be originally introduced into the world?\n\nThe common answer to this question is, that it took its rise among savages, who, in their frequent wars with each other, either massacred their captives in cold blood, or condemned them to perpetual slavery. In support of this opinion we have heard it observed, that the Latin word servus, which signifies not a hired servant, but a slave, is derived from servare, \"to preserve;\" and that such men were called servi, because they were captives, whose lives were preserved on the condition of their becoming the property of the victor.\n\nThat slavery had its origin from war, we think extremely probable (c), nor are we inclined to controvert this etymology of the word servus; but the traffic in men prevailed almost universally long before the Latin language or Roman name was heard of; and there is no good evidence that it began among savages. The word אָבִי, in the Old Testament, which in our version is rendered servant, signifies literally a slave, either born in the family or bought with money, in contradiction to אָבִי, which denotes a hired servant: and as Noah makes use of the word אָבִי in the curse which he delivered upon Ham and Canaan immediately after the deluge, it would appear that slavery had its origin before that event. If so, there can be little doubt but that it began among those violent persons whom our translators have called giants *, though the original word * Gen. vi. 4. אָבִי literally signifies affaulters of others. Those wretches seem first to have seized upon women, whom they forcibly compelled to minister to their pleasures; and from this kind of violence the progress was natural to that by which they enslaved their weaker brethren among the men, obliging them to labor for their benefit, without allowing them fee or reward.\n\nAfter the deluge the first dealer in slaves seems to have been Nimrod. \"He began,\" we are told, \"to be flayed his mighty one in the earth, and was a mighty hunter before the Lord.\" He could not, however, be the first hunter of wild beasts; for that species of hunting must have been practised from the beginning; nor is it probable that his dexterity in the chase, which was then the universal employment, could have been far superior to that of all his contemporaries, as to entitle him to the appellation of the \"the mighty hunter before the Lord.\" Hence most commentators have concluded, that he was a hunter of men; an opinion which they think receives some countenance from the import of his name, the word Nimrod signifying a rebel. Whatever\n\n---\n\n(a) Aleam (quod mirere) sobrii inter feria exercent, tanta lucrandi perdendive temeritate, ut cum omnia defecerunt, extremo ae novissimo jactu de libertate et corpore contendant. Vicit voluntariam servitutem adit; quamvis junior, quamvis robustior, alligari se ac venire patitur.—Tacitus de Mor. Germ.\n\nThe savages of North America are equally addicted to gaming with the ancient Germans, and the negroes on the Slave Coast of Guinea perhaps still more.\n\n(b) The Roman orator's definition of slavery, Parad. V. is as accurate as any that we have seen. \"Servitus est obedientia fracli animi et abjecti et arbitrio parentis suos;\" whether the unhappy person fell into that state with or without his own contract or consent.\n\n(c) In the article SOCIETY, the reader will find another account of the origin of slavery, which we think likewise probable, though we have not transferred it to this place; as it would, in our opinion, be wrong to give to one writer what we know to belong to another. It may be proper, however, to observe here, that between the two articles there is no contradiction, as barbarous wars were certainly one source of slavery.\nbe in this, there can be little doubt but that he became a mighty one by violence; for being the fifth son of his father, and apparently much younger than the other five, it is not likely that his inheritance exceeded theirs either in extent or in population. He enlarged it, however, by conquest; for it appears from Scripture, that he invaded the territories of Ashur the son of Shem, who had settled in Shinar; and obliging him to remove into Assyria, he seized upon Babylon, and made it the capital of the first kingdom in the world. As he had great projects in view, it seems to be in a high degree probable that he made bond-servants of the captives whom he took in his wars, and employed them in building or repairing the metropolis of his kingdom; and hence we think is to be dated the origin of postdiluvian slavery.\n\nThat it began thus early can hardly be questioned; for we know that it prevailed universally in the age of Abraham, who was born within seventy years after the death of Nimrod. That patriarch had three hundred and eighteen servants or slaves, born in his own house, and trained to arms, with whom he pursued and conquered the four kings who had taken captive his brother's son. And it appears from the conversation which took place between him and the king of Sodom after the battle, that both believed the conqueror had a right to consider his prisoners as part of his spoil. \"Give me (says the king) the persons, and take the goods to thyself.\" It is indeed evident from numberless passages of Scripture, that the domestics whom our translators call servants were in those days universally considered as the most valuable part of their master's property, and clasped with his flocks and herds. Thus when the sacred historian describes the wealth of Abraham, he says, that \"he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.\" And when Abimelech wished to make some reparation to the patriarch for the unintentioned injury that he had done him, \"he took sheep and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.\" The riches and power of Isaac and Jacob are estimated in the very same manner. Of the former it is said, that \"the man waxed great, and went forward and grew, until he became very great: for he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants, ἐργάτων of slaves; and the Philistines envied him.\" The latter, we are told, \"increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.\"\n\nThat the practice of buying and selling servants thus early begun among the patriarchs descended to their posterity, is known to every attentive reader of the Bible. It was expressly authorized by the Jewish law, in which are many directions how such servants were to be treated. They were to be bought only of the heathen; authorized for if an Israelite grew poor and sold himself either to pay the mortgage, debt, or to procure the means of subsistence, his law he was to be treated not as a slave ἐργάτης, but as a hired servant ἐργάτης, and restored to freedom at the year of Jubilee. \"Both thy bond-men and thy bond-maids (says Moses) shall be of the heathen that are round about you: of them shall ye buy bond-men and bond-maids. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bond-men for ever.\" Unlimited as the power thus given to the Hebrews over their bond-servants of ἐργάτων, ἐργάτης, heathen extraction appears to have been, they were strictly prohibited from acquiring such property by any other means than fair purchase: \"he that fleetheth a man and felleth him,\" said their great lawgiver, \"shall surely be put to death §.\"\n\nWhilst slavery, in a mild form, was permitted among the people of God, a much worse kind of it prevailed among the heathen nations of antiquity. With other abominable customs, the traffic in men quickly spread world-wide, from Chaldea into Egypt, Arabia, and over all the east, and by degrees found its way into every known region under heaven (D).\n\nOf this hateful commerce we shall not attempt to trace the progress through every age and country, but shall content ourselves with taking a transient view of it among the Greeks and Romans, and a few other nations, in whose customs and manners our readers must be interested.\n\nOne can hardly read a book of the Iliad or Odyssey, without perceiving that, in the age of Homer, all prisoners of war were liable to be treated as slaves, and compelled, without regard to their rank, sex, or years, to labour for their masters in offices of the vilest drudgery. So universally was this cruel treatment of captives admitted to be the right of the victor, that the poet introduces Hector in the very act of taking a tender and perhaps last farewell of his wife, when it was surely his business to afford her every consolation in his power, telling her, as a thing of course which could not be concealed, that, on the conquest of Troy, she would be compelled\n\nTo bear the victor's hard commands, or bring\n\nThe weight of water from Hyperia's spring (E).\n\nAt that early period, the Phoenicians, and probably the Greeks themselves, had such an established commerce in slaves, that, not satisfied with reducing to bondage their prisoners of war, they scrupled not to kidnap in cold blood\n\n(d) If credit be due to a late account of China, the people of that vast empire have never made merchandise of men or women. The exception, however, is so singular, that we should be glad to see it better authenticated; for it is apparent from works of the most undoubted credit, that over all the other eastern countries with which we are acquainted slavery has prevailed from time immemorial, and that some of the Indian nations make long journeys into Africa for the sole purpose of buying slaves.\n\n(e) In those early times drawing water was the office of the meanest slaves. This appears from Joshua's curse upon the Gibeonites who had deceived him.—\"Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the house of my God.\" To this state of bondage Homer makes Hector say, that Andromache would necessarily be brought upon the destruction of Troy; ἐπὶ τῆς ἀπολογίας τῆς Ἀνδρομάχης.—Iliad. lib. vi.\nblood persons who had never kindled their resentment, in order to supply their foreign markets. In the 14th book of the Odyssey, Ulysses represents himself as having narrowly escaped a snare of this kind laid for him by a false physician, who had doomed the hero to Libyan slavery; and as the whole narrative, in which this circumstance is told, is an artful fiction, intended to have the appearance of truth to an Ithacan peasant, the practice of kidnapping slaves could not then have appeared incredible to any inhabitant of that island.\n\nSuch were the manners of the Greeks in the heroic age; nor were they much improved in this respect at periods of greater refinement. Philip of Macedon having conquered the Thebans, not only sold his captives, but even took money for permitting the dead to be buried; and Alexander, who had more generosity than Philip, afterwards razed the city of Thebes, and sold the inhabitants, men, women, and children, for slaves. This cruel treatment of a brave people may indeed be supposed to have proceeded, in the first instance, from the avarice of the conqueror; and in the second, from the momentary resentment of a man who was savage and generous by turns, and who had no command of his passions. We shall not positively assign it to other causes; but from the manner in which the Spartans behaved to their slaves, there is little reason to imagine that had they received from the Thebans the same provocation with Alexander, they would have treated their captives with greater lenity. \"At Sparta (says a humane and elegant writer) slaves were treated with a degree of rigour that is hardly conceivable; although to them, as their husbandmen and artificers, their proud and idle masters were indebted for all the necessaries of life. The Lacedemonian youth, trained up in the practice of deceiving and butchering those poor men, were from time to time let loose upon them, in order to show their proficiency in stratagem and massacre. And once, without any provocation, and merely for their own amusement, we are told that they murdered three thousand in one night, not only with the connivance of law, but by its avowed permission. Such, in promoting the happiness of one part of society and the virtue of another, are the effects of slavery.\"\n\nIt has been said, that in Athens and Rome slaves were better treated than in Sparta; but in the former city their treatment cannot have been good, or their lives comfortable, when the Athenians relished that tragedy of Euripides in which Hecuba, the wife of Priam, is introduced as lamenting that she was chained like a dog at Agamemnon's gate? Of the estimation in which slaves were held in Rome, we may form a tolerable notion from the well-known fact, that one of those unhappy beings was often chained at the gate of a great man's house, to give admittance to the guests invited to a feast. In the early periods of the commonwealth it was customary, in certain sacred shows exhibited on solemn occasions, to drag through the circus a slave, who had been scourged to death holding in his hand a fork in the form of a gibbet. But we need not multiply proofs of the cruelty of the Romans to their slaves. If Div. lib. i., the inhuman combats of the gladiators (see GLADIATORS, cap. 26,) admit of any apology on account of the martial spirit with which they were thought to inspire the spectators, the conduct of Vettius Pollio must have proceeded from the most wanton and brutal cruelty. This man, who flourished not in the earliest periods of the republic, when the Romans were little better than a savage banditti, but in the polished age of Augustus, frequently threw such slaves as gave him the slightest offence into his fishponds to fatten his lampreys; and yet he was suffered to die in peace! The emperor, indeed, upon coming to the knowledge of his cruelty, ordered his lampreys to be destroyed, and his ponds to be filled up; but we do not recollect that any other punishment was inflicted on the savage matter. Till the reign of the same emperor the depredations of slaves were never admitted in the courts of judicature; and then they were received only when persons were accused of treasonable practices.\n\nThe origin of slavery in Rome was the same as in every other country. Prisoners of war were of course reduced to that state, as if they had been criminals. The dictator Camillus, one of the most accomplished generals of the republic, sold his Etrurian captives to pay the Roman ladies for the jewels which they had presented to Apollo. Fabius, whose cautious conduct saved his country when Hannibal was victorious in Italy, having subdued Tarentum, reduced 30,000 of the citizens to slavery, and sold them to the highest bidder. Coriolanus, when driven from Rome, and fighting for the Volsci, refused not to make slaves of his own countrymen; and Julius Caesar, among whose faults wanton cruelty has never been reckoned, sold at one time fifty-three thousand captives for slaves. Nor did the slaves in Rome consist only of foreigners taken in war. By one of the laws of the twelve tables, creditors were empowered to seize their insolvent debtors, and keep them in their housetops till, by their services or labour, they had discharged the sum they owed; and in the beginning of the commonwealth they were authorized to fell such debtors, and even to put them to death (p). The children of slaves were the property not of the commonwealth, or of their own parents, but of their masters; and thus was slavery perpetuated in the families of such unhappy\n\n(f) After a certain number of citations, the law granted to the debtor thirty days of grace to raise the sum for which he was accountable. The words of the law are: \"Æris confessi, rebusque jure judicatis, triginti dies justi sunt. Post dein manum endojaicio.—Vincito aut nervo, aut compeditus.\" When the debt is confessed, and the trial passed, let there be thirty days of forbearance; afterwards lay hands on him; bind him either with a cord or fetters. After the thirty days were expired, if the debtor had not discharged the debt, he was led to the praetor, who delivered him over to the mercy of his creditors; these bound him and kept him in chains for the space of sixty days. Afterwards, for three market-days successively, the debtor was brought to the tribunal of the praetor; then a public crier proclaimed in the forum the debt for which the prisoner was detained. It often happened, that rich persons redeemed the prisoner by paying his debts; but if nobody appeared in behalf of the debtor after the third market-day, the creditor had a right to inflict the punishments appointed by the law. \"Tertii nundinum capit.\"\nunhappy men as fell into that state, whether through the chance of war or the cruelty of a forid creditor (g). The consequence was, that the number of slaves belonging to the rich patricians was almost incredible. Caius Caecilius Idorus, who died about seven years before the Christian era, left to his heirs 4116 slaves; and if any one of those wretched creatures made an unsuccessful attempt to regain his liberty, or was even suspected of such a design, he was marked on the forehead with a red-hot iron (h). In Sicily, during the most flourishing periods of the commonwealth, it seems to have been customary for masters to mark their slaves in this manner; at least we know that such was the practice of Damophilus, who, not satisfied with this security, shut up his slaves every night in close prisons, and led them out like beasts in the morning to their daily labour in the field. Hence arose the servile war in Sicily.\n\nThough many laws were enacted by Augustus and other patriotic emperors to diminish the power of creditors over their insolvent debtors; though the influence of the mild spirit of Christianity tended much to meliorate the condition of slaves, even under Pagan masters; and though the emperor Adrian made it capital to kill a slave without a just reason; yet this infamous commerce prevailed universally in the empire for many ages after the conversion of Constantine to the religion of Christ. It was not indeed completely abolished even in the reign of Justinian; and in many countries which had once been provinces of the empire it continued long after the empire itself had fallen to pieces.\n\nIt has already been observed, that among the ancient Germans it was not uncommon for an ardent gamester to lose his personal liberty by a throw of the dice. This was indeed a strong proof of savage manners; but the general condition of slaves among those savages seems to have been much better than among the polished Greeks and Romans. In Germany the slaves were generally attached to the soil, and only employed in tending cattle, and carrying on the business of agriculture; for the menial offices of every great man's house were performed by his wife and children. Such slaves were seldom beaten, or chained, or imprisoned. Sometimes indeed they were killed by their masters in a fit of sudden passion; but none were considered as materials of commerce, except those who had originally been freemen, and lost their freedom by play. These, indeed, the successful gamester was very ready to sell, both because he felt them an useless burden, and because their presence continually put him in mind of that state to which a throw of the dice might one day reduce himself.\n\nSuch is the account which Tacitus gives * of slavery among the ancient Germans. The Anglo-Saxons, however, after they were settled in this island seem not to have carried on that traffic so honourably. By a statute of Alfred the Great †, the purchase of a man, a horse, or an ox, without a voucher to warrant the sale, was strictly forbidden. That law was, doubtless, enacted to prevent the fleecing of men and cattle; but it shows us that so late as the ninth or tenth century a man, when fairly purchased, was, in England, as much the property of the buyer as the horse on which he rode, or the ox which dragged his plough. In the same country, now so nobly tenacious of freedom and the rights of man, a species of slavery similar to that which prevailed among the ancient Germans subsisted even to the end of the sixteenth century. This appears from a commission issued by Queen Elizabeth in 1574, for inquiring into the lands and goods of all her bond-men and bond-women in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Gloucester, in order to compound with them for their manumission, that they might enjoy their lands and goods as freemen ‡. In Scotland there certainly existed an order of slaves or bond-men, who tillled the soil, ground, were attached to the soil, and with it were transferable from one proprietor to another, at a period so late as the thirteenth century; but when or how those villains, as they were called, obtained their freedom, seems to be unknown to every lawyer and antiquary of the present day. Coaliers and fitters were, in the same country, slaves till little more than 30 years ago, that they were manumitted by an act of the British legislature, and restored to the rights of freemen and citizens. Before that period the sons of coaliers could follow no business but that of their fathers; nor were they at liberty to seek employment in any other mines than those to which they were attached by birth, without the consent of the lord of the manor, who, if he had no use for their services himself, transferred them by a written deed to some neighbouring proprietor.\n\nThat the savage nations of Africa were at any period slavery among the Carthaginians,\n\ncapite penas dato aut trans Tiberim peregre venunduito;\" that is, \"Let him on the third market-day be punished with death, or sold beyond the Tiber as a slave.\" If there were several creditors, they were allowed, in consequence of this severe law, to divide the body of the prisoner into several parts, and share it among them in proportion to the sum which they demanded.\n\n(g) This is evident from the story of Appius and Virginia. See ROME, No 113.\n\n(h) How capriciously and unjustly this infamous mark was impressed, we learn from the story of Retio. This man being proscribed, and a reward offered for his head by the triumvirs Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus, concealed himself from the fury of the tyrants in the best way that he could. A slave whom he had marked with the hot iron having found out the place of his retreat, conducted him to a cave, and there supported him for some time with what he earned by his daily labour. At length a company of soldiers coming that way, and approaching the cave, the faithful slave, alarmed at the danger his master was in, followed them close, and falling upon a poor peasant, killed him in their presence, and cut off his head, crying out, \"I am now revenged on my master for the marks with which he has branded me.\" The soldiers, seeing the infamous marks on his forehead, and not doubting but he had killed Retio, snatched the head out of his hand, and returned with it in all haste to the triumvirs. They were no sooner gone, than the slave conveyed his master to the sea-side, where they had the good luck to find one of Sextius Pompeius's vessels, which transported them safe into Sicily.\nof history exempted from this opprobrium of our nature which spread over all the rest of the world, the enlightened reader will not suppose. It is indeed in that vast country that slavery has in every age appeared in its ugliest form. We have already observed, that about the era of the Trojan war, a commerce in slaves was carried on between Phoenicia and Libya; and the Carthaginians, who were a colony of Phoenicians, and revered the customs, manners, and religion of their parent state, undoubtedly continued the Tyrian traffic in human flesh with the interior tribes of Africa. Of this we might rest assured, although we had no other evidence of the fact than what results from the practice of human sacrifices so prevalent in the republic of Carthage. The genuine instincts of nature are often subdued by dire superstition, but they cannot be wholly eradicated; and the rich Carthaginian, when a human victim was demanded from him to the gods, would be ready to supply the place of his own child by the son of a poor stranger, piously purchased at whatever price. That this was, indeed, a very common practice among them, we learn from the testimony of various historians*, who assure us, that when Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuse had overthrown their generals Hanno and Bomilcar, and threatened Carthage itself with a siege, the people attributed their misfortunes to the just anger of Saturn for having been worshipped, for some years, by the sacrifices of children meanly born and secretly bought, instead of those of noble extraction. These substitutions of one offering for another were considered as a profane deviation from the religion of their forefathers; and therefore to expiate the guilt of so horrid an impiety, a sacrifice of 200 children of the first rank was on that occasion made to the bloody god. As the Carthaginians were a commercial people, we cannot suppose that they purchased slaves only for sacrifices. They undoubtedly condemned many of their prisoners of war to the state of servitude, and either sold them to foreigners, or distributed them among their senators and the leaders of their armies. Hanno, who endeavoured to usurp the supreme power in Carthage whilst that republic was engaged in war with Timoleon in Sicily†, armed 20,000 of his slaves in order to carry his nefarious purpose into execution; and Hannibal, after his decisive victory at Cannae, sold to the Greeks many of his prisoners whom the Roman senate refused to redeem‡. That illustrious commander was indeed more humane, as well as more politic, than the generality of his countrymen. Before his days it was customary with the Carthaginians either to massacre their captives in cold blood, that they might never again bear arms against them, or to offer them in sacrifice as a grateful acknowledgement to the gods by whose assistance they believed that they were vanquished; but this was not always done even by their most superstitious or most unprincipled leaders. Among other rich spoils which Agathocles, after his victory already mentioned, found in the camp of Hanno and Bomilcar, were twenty thousand pair of fetters and manacles, which those generals had provided for such of the Sicilian prisoners as they intended to preserve alive and reduce to a state of slavery.\n\nWith the ancient state of the other African nations we are but very little acquainted. The Numidians, Mauritanians, Getulians, and Garamantes, are indeed mentioned by the Roman historians, who give us ample details of the battles which they fought in attempting to preserve their national independence; but we have no particular account of their different manners and customs in that age when Rome was disputing with Carthage the sovereignty of the world. All the African states of which we know anything, were in alliance with one or other of those rival republics; and as the people of those states appear to have been less enlightened than either the Romans or the Carthaginians, we cannot suppose that they had purer morals, or a greater regard for the sacred rights of man, than the powerful nations by whom they were either protected or oppressed. They would, indeed, infamously adopt their customs; and the ready market which Marius found for the prisoners taken in the town Capfa, although Sallust acknowledges† that the sale was contrary to the laws of war, shows that slavery was then no strange thing to the Numidians. It seems indeed to have prevailed through all Africa from the very first peopling of that unexplored country; and we doubt if in any age of the world the unhappy negro was absolutely secure of his personal freedom, or even of not being sold to a foreign trader.\n\nIt is the common opinion that the practice of making slaves of the negroes is of a very modern date; that with the it owes its origin to the incursions of the Portuguese on the coast of Guinea begun by the Portuguese, and would never have existed. But all this is a complication of mistakes. A learned writer has lately proved, with a force of evidence which admits of no reply, that from the coast of Guinea a great trade in slaves was carried on by the Arabs some hundreds of years before the Portuguese embarked in that traffic, or had even seen a woolly-headed negro. Even the wandering Arabs of the desert, who never had any friendly correspondence with the Christians of Europe, early periods have from time immemorial been served by negro slaves. \"The Arab must be poor indeed (says M. de Briff.) not to have at least one negro slave. His sole occupation is the care of the herd. They are never employed in war, but they have it in their power to marry. Their wives, who are captive negresses, do all the domestic work, and are roughly treated by the Arabian women, and by the Arabs themselves. Their children are slaves like them, and put to all kinds of drudgery.\" Surely no man whose judgement is not completely warped by prejudice, will pretend that those roving tribes of savages, so remarkable for their independent spirit and attachment to ancient customs, learned to enslave the negroes from the Europeans. In all probability they have, without interruption, continued the practice of slavery from the days of their great ancestor Ishmael; and it seems evident, that none of the European nations had ever seen a woolly headed negro till the year 1159, when the crusaders fell in with a small party of them near the town of Hebron in Judea, and were so struck with the novelty of their appearance, that the army burst into a general fit of laughter*. Long before the crusades, however, we know with certainty that the natives of Guinea had been exposed to sale in foreign countries. In 651 the Mahometan Arabs of Egypt so harassed the king of Nubia or Ethiopia, who was a Christian, that he agreed to send them annually, by way of tribute, a vast number of Nubian or Ethiopic...\nSlavery.\n\npian slaves into Egypt. Such a tribute as this at that time, we are told, was more agreeable to the khalif than any other, as the Arabs then made no small account of those slaves.\n\nThe very proposal of such a tribute, and the estimation in which black slaves were held in Egypt, shows that a commerce in bond servants could not then be a new branch of trade either to the Arabs or the Ethiopians; but the vast number which the Ethiopian monarch was now compelled to furnish every year, induced him to feed this great drain upon his subjects from the natives of the neighbouring countries. He ranged accordingly into all that vast blank of geography upon the map of the world, the spreading bosom of the African continent; and even pushed through it to its farthest extremities in the west. He thus brought the blacks of Guinea, for the first time, into the service and families of the east; and the slaves which he paid in tribute to the Arabs, whether derived from the nearer neighbourhood of Ethiopia, fetched from the Mediterranean regions of Africa, or brought from the distant shores of the Atlantic, were all denominated Ethiopians, from the country by which they were conveyed into Egypt.\n\nAt this time, therefore, according to Mr Whitaker, began that kind of traffic in human flesh\n\n\"Which spoils unhappy Guinea of its sons.\"\n\nThere are not many authors from whom, in questions of antiquity, we differ with greater hesitation; but, as we meet with a female Ethiopian slave in the Eunuch of Terence, we cannot help suspecting that Guinea was occasionally \"spoiled of its sons\" at a much earlier period. At any rate, from the observations made by the European travellers who first penetrated into that continent, it appears undeniable that slavery must have prevailed from time immemorial among such of the tribes as had never carried on any commerce with foreign nations. When Battel first visited the Giagas, those people had never before seen a white man; yet they welcomed him and the English, with whom he had come, to their country, invited them to bring their goods on shore, and without hesitation loaded the ships with slaves. The Giagas were indeed waging war with the kingdom of Benguela; and being cannibals, who prefer human flesh to all others, the slaves whom they had sold to the English were probably prisoners whom they would have killed and eaten if they had not found an opportunity of otherwise disposing of them to greater advantage. But as they had not been incited by the Europeans to eat their prisoners, there can be no reason to suppose that by the Europeans they had been first induced to sell them; for we have seen that this kind of commerce prevailed in Africa among people much more polished than the Giagas so early as in the reign of Jugurtha.\n\nThat it was not introduced among the negroes either by the Arabs or by the Portuguese, appears still more evident from the behaviour of the Dahomans at the conquest of Whidah, and from the manner in which the people of Angola at the earliest stage of their foreign slavery trade procured a supply of slaves for the Portuguese market. The greater part of the slaves whom the Angolans exported from St Paulo de Loanda were brought from interior countries, some hundreds of leagues distant, where they could not have been regularly purchased had that commerce been till then unknown in those countries. The Dahomans, in the beginning of the year 1727, had never seen a white man; and when their victorious prince and his army, in their rout through Whidah, first met with some Europeans in the town of Sabi, they were so shocked at their complexion and their dress, that they were afraid to approach them, and could not be persuaded that they were men till they heard them speak, and were assured by the Whidanefe that these were the merchants who purchased all the slaves that were sold in Guinea. Slavery, therefore, if it prevailed among the Dahomans before that period, could not have been introduced among them by European or Arabian intrigues; but we are assured by Snelgrave, who was then in the army, that those people treated their captives with such horrid cruelty as was shocking to the natives of the sea-coast, and leaves no room for doubt but that slavery had been practised among them from the earliest ages. A great part of their prisoners were sacrificed to their gods or eaten by the soldiers; and when our author expressed to a colonel of the guard some surprize that a prince so enlightened as the sovereign of Dahomy should sacrifice so many men whom he might have sold to great advantage, he was gravely told, that it had been the custom of their nation, from time immemorial, to offer, after victory, a certain number of prisoners to the gods; and that they selected the old men for victims, because they were of less value at market, and more dangerous from their experience and cunning, than the young men. To those persons who fancy that the wars between the African princes are carried on for the sole purpose of supplying the European ships with slaves, it may be proper to remark, that one of the kings of Dahomy slaughtered at once not only all the captives taken in war, but also 127 prisoners of different kinds, that he might have a sufficiency of skulls to adorn the walls of his palace; though at the very time of that massacre he knew that there were six slave-ships in the road of Whidah, from which he could have got for every prime slave a price little short of thirty pounds sterling.\n\nThese facts, and numberless others which the reader will find detailed in the 13th volume of the Modern Universal History, by writers who were at the greatest pains to procure authentic information; who were neither biased by interest nor blinded by enthusiasm; and who appear to have held the infamous traffic in utter abhorrence—prove beyond the possibility of doubt, that slavery of the worst kind must have prevailed among all the negro nations before they were visited either by the Portuguese or by the Arabs (1). These two nations may\n\n(1) The same thing appears from the voyages of M. Saugnier, who had an opportunity of conversing with many tribes of negroes, and who always speaks of slavery as an established practice among them; adding, that such as are sold for crimes are put to death by their own countrymen if they fly from their master. It appears likewise in a still more striking light from Dalzel's History of Dahomy, where we are told that all the Dahomans,\nmay indeed have been the first who dragged the unhappy negro from his native continent, and made his slavery doubly severe, by compelling him to labour, without his own consent, for masters whom he hardly considered as human beings.\n\nOn the beginning of this commerce, or the dreadful cruelty with which it has been carried on to the present day, it is impossible to reflect without horror; but there is some consolation, however small, in knowing that its original authors were not Europeans. The purchase of Guinea blacks for slaves by foreign nations commenced ages before the Portuguese had laid that country open to the intercourse of Europe. Even after they had made many incursions into it, the inhabitants were as regularly purchased for slaves by some of the adjoining states as they are now by the maritime Europeans.\n\n\"The Arabs of Egypt having reduced all the north of Africa, and carrying with them their love of black servants, would be sure to open a ready communication for themselves to their country. They certainly had one so early as 1512, and before the Europeans had any for that purpose (k). They went from Barbary by a route that was so much practised, as to be denominated expressly 'the way of the camels.' Meeting together at the town of Cape Cantin, or that of Valadie near it, the commercial caravan traversed the vast deserts, those of Sarra, which run like the tropic of Cancer over them in a long line across the country; to a place of great population called Hoden, the Waden or Hoden of our maps, and a little to the south-west of Cape Blanco. From Hoden they turned to the left, and pushed directly into the interior of the continent, to reach Tezgaza, the Tagozel or Tagaza of our maps, and lying nearly east of Hoden. Here assuredly they did, as the caravan does certainly at this day; and added to the other wares upon their camels a quantity of salt from those mines of rock-salt, which are extraordinary enough to be noticed as rocks in our maps. This they carried, as they still carry it, to Tanbut, the Tombut of the maps, and a town in the heart of the African continent. And from this town they turned on the right for the sea coast again, and reached it in the great kingdom of Mele, the Meli of our maps, to the south of the Gambia, and just at the springing as it were of that grand arch of sea which curves so deeply into the body of the Slavery-land, and constitutes the extensive gulf of Guinea.\n\nAt Melli and at Tombut they received a measure of gold for a measure of salt. The caravan collects gold at Tombut to the present time; but at Melli they purchased gold, and also silver, in pieces as large as pebbles. And at Hoden they had a great mart for slaves; the blacks being brought thither from the countries adjoining, and bartered away to the traders. Such was the Slave Coast and the Gold Coast of former days. The staple commodity of Hoden is only transferred now to Whidah; and diverted from the Arabs of Barbary to the Christians of Europe,\" by whom the negroes are which is carried to the continent of America or to the Sugar-naw islands in the West Indies. In these countries they are treated as Europeans are, all fold like beasts in a market; but they experience very different degrees of servitude from the different masters who hold them as property. Such of them as are reconciled to the appearance of white men, or have been born in the European colonies, feel themselves as happy under a humane master as they could be in their native continent (l); and we believe that few of them in such circumstances have expressed a desire to return.\"\n\nIn the French West India islands, before the late revolution in the mother country, which has produced in all its dependencies anarchy and massacre, the condition of the negro slaves was better than that of the bond-men among the ancient Germans. \"Those of them old governors who cultivated the plantations were attached to the soil, and could not be drawn off to pay debts, or be sold separately from the estate on which they lived. This gave them a lasting property in their huts and little spots of ground, which they might safely cultivate without dread of being turned out of possession, or transferred contrary to their interest and feelings from one proprietor to another. They were under the protection of law as soon as they arrived in the colony. Proper missionaries were appointed for the purpose of training them up to a certain degree of religious knowledge, and ample funds were allotted for the maintenance of those ecclesiastics. On ill treatment received from his master, or on being deprived of his allowance of food and raiment, the slave was directed to apply to the king's attorney,\n\nmans, from the lowest to the highest, acknowledge the right of the sovereign to dispose of their persons and properties at pleasure; and where we learn, that the sovereign himself assured Mr Abson the English governor at Whidah, that all his ancestors had from time immemorial put to death every prisoner of war whom they could not fell as a slave.\n\n(k) In the year 1442, Anthony Gonzalez, a Portuguese adventurer, restored to their native country some Moorish prisoners whom he had two years before forcibly carried off from the coast of Africa. He landed them at Rio del Oro, and received from the Moors in exchange ten blacks and a quantity of gold dust. This transaction proves, that a commerce in black servants was then regularly carried on by the Moors and not by the Portuguese. So early as the year 1502, the Spaniards began to employ a few negroes in the mines of Hispaniola; but in the year following, Ovando, the governor of that island, forbade the further importation of them, alleging that they taught the Indians all manner of wickedness, and rendered them less tractable than formerly: and it was not till the year 1517 that the supply of negroes to the Spanish American plantations became an established and regular branch of commerce. Edwards's History of the West Indies, Book IV. chap. ii.\n\n(l) \"I have observed many of my slaves go on board the vessel with joy, on my assurance that they would be well treated and happy on the plantation where I was going to send them. When the Banbarans find that they are treated by the whites, they never think of making their escape, choosing to be the slaves of Europeans rather than of a black man who would treat them with the greatest cruelty.

That officer was also bound to prosecute, if by any other means he heard of the abuse; the law adding as the reason, This we will to be observed, to check the\n\nWe with it were in our power to say, that in the British West India colonies slaves are equally protected by law as they were in the French islands under the old government; and that the same care is taken of their moral and religious improvement. This, however, we are afraid, cannot be said with truth. In the island of Jamaica, before the passing of the consolidated slave act, not many years ago, a white man, whether proprietor or not, who had killed a negro, or by an act of severity been the cause of his death, was, for the first offence, entitled to benefit of clergy, and not liable to capital punishment till a repetition of the crime. By the present law, it is enacted, \"That if any person, whether owner or superintendent of slaves, shall be convicted of having, by any act of passion or cruelty, occasioned the death of any negro, it shall be capital for the first offence; and for the greater security of the property, and as a check on those who may have the punishment of slaves in their power, it is particularly required, that every surgeon or doctor belonging to each estate shall swear to the cause of the death of each negro, to the best of his knowledge and belief; and if any negro dies, and is interred by the owner or overseer, without the doctor's having been or been sent for to such negro, in this case the owner or overseer causing the negro to be so interred is liable to a prosecution for such conduct.\"\n\nThis law must doubtless be productive of good effects, but being a colonial act, it cannot have the vigour of the Code Noir; nor do we know of any attorney in the island who is obliged to defend the rights of the negroes, or prosecute the master whose cruelty has by any means come to his knowledge. The justices and vestry of each parish are indeed constituted a council of protection, for the express purpose of making full enquiry into the barbarities exercised on slaves, and bringing the authors to punishment at the public expense; and by a new slave act of Grenada, the justices are required annually to nominate three freeholders to be guardians of the slaves, who are to take an oath to see the law duly executed.\n\nThese are benevolent regulations; but we doubt if protection can be so promptly afforded by a council of guardians as by an individual attorney who has no other employment. In some of the other British islands, we have been confidently told that the unfortunate sons of Africa have no protection whatever against the tyranny of a lordly owner, or the caprice of a boyish overseer (at); though it is added, that the humanity of many masters more than supplies the want of laws in every respect but that of improvement, and that the attachment of others has in them a like effect. In some cases good sense, a regard for their reputation, and a well-informed conviction of their interest, induce men to treat their slaves with discretion and humanity. The slaves of Slavery, many a planter possess advantages beyond what the labourer even of Britain enjoys; yet these advantages all depend upon the good will of his master; and in no part of the British colonies are the slaves attached to the soil. This single circumstance, together with the total neglect of their moral and religious culture, makes their situation much less eligible than was that of the French slaves under the old government; and affords a striking proof of what the humane author whom we have just quoted well observes, that \"those men and nations whom liberty hath exalted, and who therefore ought to regard it tenderly in others, are constantly for restraining its blessings within their own little circle, and delight more in augmenting the train of their dependants than in adding to the rank of fellow-citizens, or in diffusing the benefits of freedom among their neighbours.\"\n\nHaving given this ample detail of the rise and progress of slavery in the world, and shown that it has prevailed in every age, and under all religions, we shall now proceed to enquire whether a practice so general be in any instance lawful; and if it be, how it must be modified, in order to be rendered consistent with the rights of man and the immutable laws of virtue.\n\nThat in a state of nature one man has a right to seize upon another, and to compel him by force to labour for his subsistence, is a position which we believe has never been seriously maintained. But independent communities stand to each other in the very same relation that individuals do in a state of nature; and therefore if in such a state the man of greater bodily strength or mental sagacity would have no right to convert his weaker neighbour into personal property, neither can the more powerful and enlightened nation have a right to carry off by force, or entice by fraud, the subjects of a weaker and more barbarous community for the purpose of reducing them to a state of servitude. This is a truth so obvious as to admit neither of proof nor of denial.\n\nIn thus stating the case between two independent nations, we have in our eye that traffic in slaves which is carried on between the civilized Europeans and the barbarous Africans; and the utmost length which we think an apologist for that trade can go is to contend, that we may lawfully purchase slaves in those countries where from time immemorial they have been a common branch of commerce. But the European right to purchase cannot be better than the African right to sell; and we have never yet been informed what gives one African a right to sell another. Such a right cannot be natural, for the reason which we have elsewhere assigned (see History): neither can it be adventitious; for adventitious rights are immediately derived from the municipal law, which is the public will of the state. But the state has no authority to deprive an innocent man of his personal freedom, or of the produce of his own labour; for it is only to secure these, by protecting the weak.\n\n---\n\n(M) In Barbadoes there is said to be a law for the protection of slaves, which is the most insolent trifling with justice and humanity that the writer of this article has ever seen. It is enacted, forsooth, \"That if any man shall, of wantonness, or only of bloody-mindedness, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro or other slave, if his own, he shall pay into the public treasury fifteen pounds sterling! See Dickson's Letters on Slavery, p. 4.\nweak from the violence of the strong, that states are formed, and individuals united under civil government.\n\nIt may perhaps be said, that by patiently submitting to governments which authorize the traffic in human flesh, men virtually give up their personal liberty, and vest their governors with a right to sell them as slaves; but no man can vest another with a right which he possesses not himself; and we shall not hesitate to affirm, that in a state of nature where all have equal rights, no individual can submit himself to the absolute disposal of another without being guilty of the greatest crime. The reason is obvious. From the relation in which men stand to one another as fellow-creatures, and to God as their common Creator, there are duties incumbent upon each peculiar to himself; in the performance of which he can be guided only by his own reason, which was given him for that very purpose. But he who renounces his personal freedom, and submits unconditionally to the caprice of a master, imprudently attempts to set himself free from the obligation of that law which is interwoven with his very being, and chooses a direction of his conduct different from that which God has assigned him. A man therefore cannot put himself in a state of unconditional servitude; and what he cannot do for himself, he surely cannot authorize others to do for him either by a tacit or by an open consent.\n\nThese considerations have often made us regret that writers, for whose talents and integrity we have the highest respect, should, without accurately defining what they mean by slavery, have peremptorily affirmed, that, consistently with the law of nature men may be reduced to that state as a punishment for crimes, or to differ charge debts which they cannot otherwise pay. That a criminal, who has forfeited his life to the laws of his country, may have his punishment commuted for hard labour, till death in the course of nature shall put a period to his terrestrial existence, is a truth which we apprehend cannot be controverted; but to make such a commutation of punishments consistent with the laws of nature and of nature's God, it appears to us that the kind and degree of labour must be precisely ascertained, and the conduct of the criminal not left to the capricious direction of any individual.\n\nPunishments can be justly inflicted only for one or other of two ends, or for both. They may be calculated either to reform the criminal or to be a warning to the innocent; and those which most effectually answer both these purposes are surely to be preferred to such as answer but one of them. For this reason we consider hard labour as a much fitter punishment for most crimes than death; but to entitle it to preference, the kind and degree of the labour must be ascertained by the law; for if these circumstances be omitted, and the offender delivered over as a slave to the absolute disposal and caprice of a private master, the labour to which he is condemned, instead of operating to his reformation, may be converted into the means of tempting him to the commission of new crimes. A young woman, in the state of servitude, would hardly be able to maintain her virtue against the solicitations of a master who should promise her liberty or a remission of toil upon her yielding to his desires; and the felon, who had long been accustomed to a life of vagrancy and idleness, would not strenuously object to the perpetration of any wickedness to obtain his freedom, or even a diminution of his daily task. Indeed such temptations might be thrown in his way, as human nature could not resist but by means of much better principles than felons can be supposed to possess. He might be scourged into compliance; or his labour might be so increased as to make him for a little refuse eagerly embrace the most nefarious proposal which his master could make: for being absolute property, there is no earthly tribunal to which he could appeal for justice; and felons do not commonly support themselves under trials by pious meditations on a future state.\n\nBy reasoning in this way, we are far from meaning to insinuate that slave-holders in general torture their slaves into the commission of crimes. God forbid! Many of them we know to be religious, humane, and benevolent; but they are not infallible; and some of them may be instigated, some of them undoubtedly have been inflamed, by avarice and other worse principles, to compel creatures, who are so absolutely their dependents, to execute deeds of darkness too hazardous for themselves. But the morality or immorality of any action, and the moral fitness of any state, are to be judged of by their natural tendency, if the one were universally practised and the other universally prevalent (see Moral Philosophy, No. 156.) and as the natural tendency of absolute domestic slavery among such creatures as men is to throw the most powerful temptations to vice in the way both of matter and of slave, it must be in every instance, even when employed as a punishment, inconsistent with the fundamental principles of moral virtue.\n\nSome writers indeed have maintained, and the civil children law seems to suppose, that children are the property of their parents, and may by them be sold as slaves in cases of urgent necessity: but if we duly consider how property is acquired (see Property), and attend to the natural consequences of slavery, we shall soon be convinced that this opinion is very ill founded. The rights of parents result from their duties; and it is certainly the duty of that man who has been the instrument of bringing into the world an intellectual and moral being, to do everything in his power to render the existence of that being happy both in the present life and in that which is to come. If this duty be conscientiously discharged, the parent has a manifest right to the gratitude, love, and reasonable obedience, of his child; but he cannot, in consequence of any duty performed, claim a right to transfer that child as property to the uncontrolled disposal of any private master; for this plain reason, that the man who is considered as the private property of another, cannot reasonably be supposed to enjoy happiness in this world, and is under many temptations to do what must necessarily render him miserable in the next. See Moral Philosophy, No. 138.\n\nIf criminals cannot be lawfully reduced to a state of absolute private slavery, much less surely can it be lawful to reduce insolvent debtors and prisoners-of-war to that state. Many a virtuous man, who has contracted debts with the fairest prospect of paying them, has been suddenly rendered insolvent by fire, by shipwreck, or by the bankruptcy of others with whom he was necessarily engaged in the course of his trade. Such a man can be considered in no respect as criminal. He has been indeed unfortunate; but it would be grossly unjust, as well\nwell as flockingly cruel, to add to his misfortune by reducing him to a state to which we have just seen that the vilest felon cannot be reduced without a violation of the laws of morality. Fraudulent bankrupts indeed, of whom we daily see many, might with great propriety and the strictest justice be compelled to extenuate their debts by labouring for the benefit of those whom they have injured; and criminals of other descriptions might be made to work for the benefit of the public: but in both cases the task to be performed should be ascertained by the law, and the persons of the labourers be protected by the state. If such can be called slaves, their slavery is undoubtedly consistent with every principle of virtue and religion; for they suffer nothing but the due reward of their deeds. Prisoners of war, however, can upon no honest principle be reduced even to this state of mitigated bondage; for they are so far from incurring guilt by fighting for their country, that even to their enemies their courage and conduct in such a cause must appear worthy of reward. A victorious general has certainly a right to prevent the prisoners taken in battle from again drawing their swords against him during the continuance of the war; but there are many ways by which this may be done effectually without chaining the unfortunate captives to the ear, or selling them like cattle to private purchasers, by whom they may be treated with capricious cruelty, and driven to the perpetration of the greatest crimes.\n\nTo these conclusions, and the reasoning on which they are built, we are aware it may be objected, that if private slavery were in every instance unlawful and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of morality, it would not have prevailed among the ancient patriarchs, and far less have been authorized by the Jewish law.\n\nIn reply to this objection, it may be observed, that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, though excellent men, were not characters absolutely perfect; that as their practice does not authorize polygamy or incest among us, it will not authorize the reducing of our fellow-creatures to a state of hopeless servitude; and that from the circumstances of the age in which they lived, many things were permitted to them, and were indeed harmless, which are forbidden to us, and would now be pernicious. The character of Abraham appears to have been much more perfect than that of his son or grandson; and was certainly equal, if not superior, to that of any other mere man of whom we read either in profane or even in sacred history. We are to remember, however, that he was born amidst idolaters, and was probably an idolater himself till enlightened by the inspiration of Jehovah, and called from his kindred and from his father's house. Before his conversion, he must have had much cattle and many slaves, which constituted the riches of that early period; and his case would indeed have been peculiarly hard, had he been commanded to divest himself of his servants, and to depart into a strange country very thinly inhabited, without people to protect his flocks and herds from beasts of prey. Nor would his loss have contributed in any degree to the benefit of his slaves, who, as the ranks of men were then adjusted, could not long have preserved their liberty. Had they not been forcibly reduced to their former state by their idolatrous countrymen, which in all probability they would have been, they must have soon submitted to it, or perished by hunger. Let it be remembered, too, that the bond-servants of Abraham, though constituting the most valuable part of his property, were not considered as a species of inferior beings, but were treated rather as children than as slaves. This is evident from his speaking of the reward of his house as his heir, when complaining to God of the want of seed. Indeed the manner in which this circumstance is mentioned, shows that it was then the general practice to consider domestic slaves as members of the family; for the patriarch does not say, \"I will leave my substance to this Eliezer of Damascus;\" but his words are, \"Behold to me thou hast given no seed; and lo, one born in my house is my heir.\" Gen. xv.\n\nFrom this mode of expression we are strongly inclined to think that captives taken in war were in that age of simplicity incorporated into the family or tribe of the conqueror, as they are said to be at present among the North American Indians, to supply the place of those who had fallen in battle. If so, slavery was then a very mild thing, unattended with the evils which are now in its train, and must often have been highly beneficial to the captive.\n\nThe other part of the objection appears at first sight more formidable; but perhaps a little attention to the other design of the Mosaic economy may enable us to remove it even more completely than this. We need not inform our theological readers, that one great purpose for which the posterity of Abraham were separated from the heathen nations around them, was to preserve the knowledge of the true God in a world run headlong into idolatry. As idolatry appears to have had something in its forms of worship extremely captivating to rude minds, and as the minds of the Israelites at the era of their departure from Egypt were exceedingly rude, every method was taken to keep their separation from their idolatrous neighbours as complete as possible. With this view they were commanded to sacrifice the animals which their Egyptian masters had worshipped as gods, and were taught to consider hogs and such other creatures as the heathen offered in sacrifice, when celebrating their mystical and magic rites, as too unclean to be eaten or even to be touched. Of this distinction between clean and unclean beasts, God himself assigns the reason: \"I am the Lord your God (says he), who have separated you from other people; ye shall therefore put difference between clean and unclean beasts, and between unclean fowls and clean.\" Lev. xx.\n\nFor the same reason they were prohibited from intermarrying with the heathen, or having any transaction whatever with them as neighbours; and the seven idolatrous nations of Canaan they were strictly commanded to exterminate. \"When the Lord thy God (says Moses) shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them: thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: neither shalt thou make marriages with them: thy daughter shalt thou take to thy son; for they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods.\" Deut. vii.\n\nUnder these laws, it is plain that no intercourse whatever could have place between an Israelite and a man of any other nation, unless the latter was reduced to such a state as that he could neither tempt the former, nor practise himself the rites of his idolatrous worship. But\nBut the Israelites were not separated from the rest of the world for their own sakes only: They were intended to be the repositories of the lively oracles of God, and gradually spread the light of divine truth through other nations, till the fulness of time should come, when in Christ all things were to be gathered together in one. To answer this end, it was necessary that there should be some intercourse between them and their Gentile neighbours; but we have seen that such an intercourse could only be that which fulfils between masters and their slaves.\n\nShould this apology for the slavery which was authorised by the Jewish law be deemed fanciful, we beg leave to submit to the consideration of our readers the following account of that matter, to which the same objection will hardly be made. It was morally impossible that between nations differing so widely in religion, customs, and manners, as the Jews and Gentiles, peace should for ever reign without interruption; but when wars broke out, battles would be fought, and prisoners would be taken. How were these prisoners to be disposed of? Cartels for exchange were not then known: it was the duty of the Israelites to prevent their captives from taking up arms a second time against them; they could not establish them among themselves either as artificers or as husbandmen; for their law enjoined them to have no communication with the heathen. There was therefore no other alternative but either to massacre them in cold blood, or to reduce them to the condition of slaves. It would appear, however, that those slaves were raised to the rank of citizens, or at least that their burdens were much lightened, as soon as they were convinced of the truth of the Mosaic revelation, and received into covenant with God by the rite of circumcision. They were then admitted to the celebration of the passover; concerning which one law was decreed to the stranger, and to him that was home-born. Indeed, when we consider who was the legislator of the Jews; when we reflect upon the number of laws enacted to mitigate slavery among them, and call to mind the means by which the due execution of all their laws was enforced, (see Theology), we cannot help being of opinion that the heathen, who was reduced to slavery in Judea, might be happier, if he pleased, than when living as a freeman in his own country. But whether this be so or not, is a matter with which we have no concern. On account of the hardness of their hearts, and the peculiarity of their circumstances, many things, of which slavery may have been one, were permitted to the Jews, which, if practised by Christians, would render them highly guilty.\n\nAfter treating thus largely of slavery in general, we need not occupy much of the reader's time with the\n\nSLAVE TRADE carried on by the merchants of Europe with the natives of Africa. It is well known that the Portuguese were the first Europeans who embarked in this trade, and that their example was soon followed by the Dutch and the English. Of the rise and progress of the English commerce in slaves, the reader will find a sufficient account in other articles of this work. That commerce, though long cherished by the government as a source of national and colonial wealth, was from its commencement considered by the thinking part of the nation as a traffic inconsistent with the rights of man, and suspected to be carried on by acts of violence. These suspicions were gradually spread through the people at large, and confirmed, in many instances, by evidence incontrovertible. Laws were in consequence enacted to make the negroes more comfortable on what is called the middle passage, and to protect them against the wanton cruelty of their masters in the West Indies; but the humanity of the nation was roused; and not many years ago a number of gentlemen of the most respectable characters, finding that no adequate protection could be afforded to persons in a state of hopeless servitude, formed themselves into a society at London, for the purpose of procuring a total abolition of the slave-trade. That the motives which influenced the leading men of this society were of the purest kind, cannot, we think, be questioned; for their object was to deliver those who had none to help them, and from whom they could expect no other reward for their labours of love than the blessings of them who were ready to perish. To a cause truly Christian, who did not pray for success? or who but must have felt the most pungent regret, if that success had been rendered doubtful, or even delayed, by the imprudence of some of the agents employed by the society? This we apprehend was really the case. Language calculated only to exasperate the planters could not serve the negroes; and the legislature of Great Britain would never suffer itself to be forced into any measure by the menaces of individuals.\n\nIn the year 1793, petitions were presented to parliament for the abolition of this inhuman traffic, which gave a pleasing picture of the philanthropy of the nation; but, unfortunately for the cause of freedom, it was discovered that many of the names subjoined to those petitions had been collected by means not the most honourable. The discovery, perhaps, would never have been made, had not the insulting epithets indiscriminately heaped upon the slave holders provoked those men to watch with circumspection over the conduct of their opponents. The consequence was, that suspicions of unfair dealing on the part of the petitioners were excited in the breasts of many who, though they ardently wished well to the cause, chose not to add their names to those of school-boys under age, and of peasants who knew not what they were subscribing. Let the rights of the Africans be maintained with ardour and firmness; but never let their advocates suppose that the cause of humanity requires the support of artifice. Absolute slavery, in which the actions of one man are regulated by the caprice of another, is a state demonstrably inconsistent with the obvious plan of the moral government of the world. It degrades the mental faculties of the slave, and throws, both in his way and in his master's, temptations to vice almost insurmountable. Let these truths be set in a proper light by those who have doubted; seen them exemplified; and they will surely have their full effect on the minds of a generous, and, we trust, not an impious people (n). The trade will be generally abolished; pains will be taken\n\n(n) We have not insisted upon the impolicy of the slave-trade, or endeavoured to prove that its abolition would\nken to cultivate the minds of the West Indian negroes; and the era may be at no great distance when slavery shall cease through all the British dominions.\n\nBut what benefit, it will be asked, will the negroes of Africa reap from an abolition of the slave trade? Should any thing so wildly incredible happen, as that all the nations of Christendom, in one common paroxysm of philanthropy, should abandon this commerce in servants, which has been prosecuted in all ages, and under all religions; they would only abandon it to those who were originally possessed of it, who still penetrate into the country, and who even push up to Gago at the very head of the Slave coast; and leave the wool-headed natives of it to Mahometan matters, in preference to Christian. Under such matters they were in Judea at the time of the crusades. Under such, as we learn from Mafirs Saugnier, Briffon, and others, they still are in the deserts of Africa, as well as in the islands of Johanna and Madagascar*; and it is universally known that they enslave one another as a punishment for the most whimsical crimes. Among them, indeed, slavery seems to be reduced to a system, and to descend, as it has done in more polished nations, from father to son; for both Saugnier and Waddlton speak of particular families of negroes who are exempted from that degrading state by the laws of the country.\n\nAll this we admit to be true. Most certainly the negroes would not be exempted from the miseries of servitude, though Europe and the West Indies were swallowed up in the ocean. The customs of the country, as the king of Dahomy assured Mr Abdon†, will be made as long as black men shall continue to possess their own territories, in their present state of depravity and ignorance; and these customs appear to involve slavery of the cruellest kind. But if slavery be in itself unlawful, is it a sufficient excuse for our continuing the traffic that it is carried on by the rude negroes and the savage Arabs? Are people, whom we sometimes affect to consider as an inferior order of beings, to furnish examples of conduct to those who boast of their advancements in science, in literature, and in refinement? Or will the benevolent Lord of all things pardon us for oppressing our helpless brethren, merely because they are cruelly oppressed by others? It is indeed true that the natives of Guinea cannot be made really free but by introducing among them the blessings of religion and the arts of civil life; but surely they would have fewer temptations than at present to kidnap one another, or to commence unprovoked wars for the purpose of making captives, were the nations of Europe to abandon the commerce in slaves (o). That commerce, we grant, would be continued by the Arabs, and perhaps by others of the eastern nations; but the same number of people could not be carried off by them alone that is now carried off both by them and by the Europeans.\n\nWere it indeed possible to put the slave-trade under proper regulations, so as to prevent all kidnapping and unjust wars among the Africans, to supply the markets; and were it likewise possible to ensure to the negroes in the West Indies mild treatment and religious instruction; we are far from being sure that while the natives of Guinea continue so rude, and their neighbours the Arabs so selfishly savage, it would be proper to abandon at once to hordes of barbarians the whole of this commerce in bond servants. \"The trade, which in its present form is a reproach to Britain, might be made to take a new shape, and become ultimately a blessing to thousands of wretches who, left in their native country, would have dragged out a life of miserable ignorance, unknowing the hand that framed them, unconscious of the reason of which they were made capable, and heedless of the happiness laid up for them in store §.\"\n\nSlavery is, indeed, in every form an evil; but it seems to be one of those many evils which, having long prevailed in the world, can be advantageously removed only by degrees, and as the moral cultivation of the slaves may enable them to support the rank and discharge the duties of free men. This is doubtless the reason why it was not expressly prohibited by the divine Author of our religion, but suffered to vanish gradually before the mild influence of his Heavenly doctrines. It has vanished before these doctrines in most countries of Europe, and it affords us no small gratification to have it in our power to record, what indeed must be fresh in the memory of our readers, that the abolition of the slave-trade was finally accomplished by the steady perseverance and generous exertions of some of the most enlightened and respectable characters in the kingdom, who, after a long and arduous struggle, obtained a decree of the legislature, prohibiting, after a limited period, the trade in slaves to be continued by subjects of Britain. The bill originated in the house of lords, and having undergone considerable discussion in the house of commons, finally passed on the 16th of March, and received his majesty's assent.\n\nwould be advantageous to the sugar-planters; for the planters surely understand their own interest better than those can do, who, having never been in the West Indies, are obliged to content themselves with what information they can glean on the subject from a number of violent and contradictory publications. To countenance slavery under any form is undoubtedly immoral. This we know; and therefore upon this ground have we opposed the slave-trade, which cannot be continued without preferring interest to virtue.\n\n(o) In a speech which Mr Dalzel says the king of Dahomy made to Mr Abdon, when he was informed of what had passed in England on the subject of the slave-trade, are these remarkable words: \"In the name of my ancestors and myself, I aver that no Dahoman ever embarked in war merely for the sake of procuring wherewithal to purchase your commodities.\" We must take the liberty to question the truth of this solemn averment. That the slave-trade is not the sole cause of the Dahoman wars every man will admit, who does not fancy that those people have neither passions nor appetites, but for the commodities of Europe; but the bare affirmation of this bloody delusion, who boasted of having killed many thousands at the custom-house, will not convince those who have read either Waddlton's Essay on Colonization, or the evidence reflecting the slave-trade given at the bar of the House of Commons, \"that no Dahoman ever embarked in war merely to procure slaves to barter for European commodities.\"\naffirm on the 25th March 1807. The time fixed by the bill, for the total abolition of the trade, we believe, was the beginning of the following year, viz. January 1808.\n\nWe cannot conclude without expressing a hope, that the period is not very distant when the slaves in the West Indies shall be so much improved in moral and religious knowledge, as that they may be safely trusted with their own freedom. To let them free in their present state of ignorance and depravity, is one of the wildest proposals that the ardour of innovation has ever made. Such freedom would be equally ruinous to themselves and to their masters; and we may say of it what Cicero said of some unreasonable indulgences proposed to be granted to the slaves in Sicily: *Quae cum accidant, nemo eft, quin intelligat ruere illam rempublicam; hec ubi veniant, nemo eft, qui ullam fpen salutis reliquam effe arbitretur.*\n\nThose of our readers who wish to enter into a detail of this subject, may consult, with much advantage, The History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the Abolition of the African Slave-Trade, by Mr Clarkfon, 2 vols 8vo.\n\nSLAUGHTER. See MANSLAUGHTER, HOMICIDE, MURDER, &c.\n\nSLEDGE, a kind of carriage, without wheels, for the conveyance of very weighty things, as huge stones, bells, &c. The pledge for carrying criminals, condemned for high treason, to execution, is called HURDLE. The Dutch have a kind of pledge on which they can carry a vessel of any burden by land. It consists of a plank of the length of the keel of a moderate ship, raised a little behind, and hollow in the middle; so that the sides go a little aloft, and are furnished with holes to receive pins, &c. The rest is quite even.\n\nSLEDGE is a large smith's hammer, to be used with both hands: of this there are two sorts, the up-hand sledge, which is used by under workmen, when the work is not of the largest sort; it is used with both the hands before, and they seldom raise it higher than their head. But the other, which is called the about-sledge, and which is used for battering or drawing out the largest work, is held by the handle with both hands, and swung round over their heads, at their arm's end, to strike as hard a blow as they can.\n\nSLEEP, that state of the body in which, though the vital functions continue, the senses are not affected by the ordinary impressions of external objects. See DREAMS and PHYSIOLOGY.\n\nSLEEP-Walker, one who walks in his sleep. Many instances might be related of persons who were addicted to this practice; but it will be sufficient to select one remarkable instance from a report made to the Physical Society of Lausanne, by a committee of gentlemen appointed to examine a young man who was accustomed to walk in his sleep.\n\nThe disposition to sleep-walking seems, in the opinion of this committee, to depend on a particular affection of the nerves, which both seizes and quits the patient during sleep. Under the influence of this affection, the imagination represents to him the objects that struck him while awake, with as much force as if they really affected his senses; but does not make him perceive any of those that are actually presented to his senses, except in so far as they are connected with the dreams which engross him at the time. If, during this state, the imagination has no determined purpose, he receives the impression of objects as if he were awake; only, however, when the imagination is excited to bend its attention towards them. The perceptions obtained in this state are very accurate, and, when once received, the imagination renews them occasionally with as much force as if they were again acquired by means of the senses. Lastly, these academicians suppose, that the impressions received during this state of the senses disappear entirely when the person awakes, and do not return till the return of the same disposition in the nervous system.\n\nTheir remarks were made on the Sieur Devaud, a lad thirteen years and a half old, who lives in the town of Vevey, and who is subject to that singular affection or disease called Somnambulism or sleep-walking. This lad possesses a strong and robust constitution, but his nervous system appears to be organized with peculiar delicacy, and to discover marks of the greatest sensibility and irritability. His senses of smell, taste, and touch, are exquisite; he is subject to fits of immoderate and involuntary laughter, and he sometimes likewise weeps without any apparent cause.\n\nThis young man does not walk in his sleep every night; several weeks sometimes pass without any appearance of a fit. He is subject to the disease generally two nights successively, one fit lasting for several hours. The longest are from three to four hours, and they commonly begin about three or four o'clock in the morning.\n\nThe fit may be prolonged, by gently passing the finger or a feather over his upper lip, and this slight irritation likewise accelerates it. Having once fallen asleep upon a staircase, his upper lip was thus irritated with a feather, when he immediately ran down the steps with great precipitation, and resumed all his accustomed activity. This experiment was repeated several times.\n\nThe young Devaud thinks he has observed, that on the evenings previous to a fit, he is sensible of a certain heaviness in his head, but especially of a great weight in his eyelids.\n\nHis sleep is at all times unquiet, but particularly when the fits are about to seize him. During his sleep, motions are observable in every part of his body, with starting and palpitations; he utters broken words, sometimes sits up in his bed, and afterwards lies down again. He then begins to pronounce words more distinctly, he rises abruptly, and acts as he is inflamed by the dream that then possesses him. He is sometimes in sleep subject to continued and involuntary motions.\n\nThe departure of the fit is always preceded by two or three minutes of calm sleep, during which he snores. He then awakes rubbing his eyes like a person who has slept quietly.\n\nIt is dangerous to awaken him during the fit, especially if it is done suddenly; for then he sometimes falls into convulsions. Having risen one night with the intention of going to eat grapes, he left the house, passed through the town, and went to a vineyard where he expected good cheer. He was followed by several persons, who kept at some distance from him, one of whom fired a pistol, the noise of which instantly awakened him, and he fell down without sense. He was carried home and brought to himself, when he recollected very well the having\nhaving been awakened in the vineyard; but nothing more, except the fright at being found there alone, which had made him swoon.\n\n\"After the fits he generally feels a degree of lassitude: sometimes, though rarely, of indisposition. At the end of one of those fits, of which the gentlemen of the committee were witnesses, he was affected with vomiting; but he is always soon restored.\n\n\"When he is awaked, he never for the most part recollects any of the actions he has been doing during the fit.\n\n\"The subject of his dreams is circumscribed in a small circle of objects, that relate to the few ideas with which at his age his mind is furnished; such as his lessons, the church, the bells, and especially tales of ghosts. It is sufficient to strike his imagination the evening before a fit with some tale, to direct his somnambulism towards the object of it. There was read to him while in this situation the story of a robber; he imagined the very next moment that he saw robbers in the room. However, as he is much disposed to dream that he is surrounded with them, it cannot be affirmed that this was an effect of the reading. It is observed, that when his supper has been more plentiful than usual, his dreams are more dismal.\n\n\"In their report, the gentlemen of the committee dwell much on the state of this young man's senses, on the impression made upon them by strange objects, and on the use they are of to him.\n\n\"A bit of strong smelling wood produced in him a degree of restlessness; the fingers had the same effect, whether from their smell or their transpiration. He knew wine in which there was wormwood by the smell, and said that it was not wine for his table. Metals make no impression on him.\n\n\"Having been presented with a little common wine while he was in a state of apathy, and all his motions were performed with languor, he drank it willingly; but the irritation which it occasioned produced a deal of vivacity in all his words, motions, and actions, and caused him to make involuntary grimaces.\n\n\"Once he was observed dressing himself in perfect darkness. His clothes were on a large table, mixed with those of some other persons; he immediately perceived this, and complained of it much; at last a small light was brought, and then he dressed himself with sufficient precision. If he is teased or gently pinched, he is always sensible of it, except he is at the time strongly engrossed with some other thing, and wishes to strike the offender; however, he never attacks the person who has done the ill, but an ideal being whom his imagination presents to him, and whom he pursues through the chamber without running against the furniture, nor can the persons whom he meets in his way divert him from his pursuit.\n\n\"While his imagination was employed on various subjects, he heard a clock strike, which repeated at every stroke the note of the cuckoo. There are cuckoos here, said he; and, upon being desired, he imitated the song of that bird immediately.\n\n\"When he wishes to see an object, he makes an effort to lift his eyelids; but they are so little under his command, that he can hardly raise them a line or two, while he draws up his eyebrows; the iris at that time appears fixed, and his eye dim. When anything is presented to him, and he is told of it, he always half opens his eyes with a degree of difficulty, and then flits them after he has taken what was offered to him.\n\n\"The report infers from these facts, and from many others relative to the different senses, that their functions are not suspended as to what the sleep-walker wishes to see, that is, to all those perceptions which accord with the objects about which his imagination is occupied; that he may also be disposed to receive those impressions, when his imagination has no other object at the time; that in order to see, he is obliged to open his eyes as much as he can, but when the impression is once made, it remains; that objects may strike his sight without striking his imagination, if it is not interested in them; and that he is sometimes informed of the presence of objects without either seeing or touching them.\n\n\"Having engaged him to write a theme, say the committee, we saw him light a candle, take pen, ink, and paper, from the drawer of his table, and begin to write, while his master dictated. As he was writing, we put a thick paper before his eyes, notwithstanding which he continued to write and to form his letters very distinctly; showing signs, however, that something was incommending him, which apparently proceeded from the obstruction which the paper, being held too near his nose, gave to his respiration.\n\n\"Upon another occasion, the young somnambulist arose at five o'clock in the morning, and took the necessary materials for writing, with his copy-book. He meant to have begun at the top of a page; but finding it already written on, he came to the blank part of the leaf, and wrote some time from the following words, *Fiant ignari priritie—Ils deviennent ignorans par la pareffe* and, what is remarkable, after several lines he perceived he had forgot the s in the word *ignorans*, and had put erroneously a double r in *pareffe*; he then gave over writing, to add the s he had forgotten, and to erase the superfluous r.\n\n\"Another time he had made, of his own accord, a piece of writing, in order, as he said, to please his master. It consisted of three kinds of writing, text, half text, and small text; each of them performed with the proper pen. He drew, in the corner of the same paper, the figure of a hat; he then asked for a penknife to take out a blot of ink which he had made between two letters, and he erased it without injuring them. Lastly, he made some arithmetical calculations with great accuracy.\n\n\"In order to explain some of the facts observed by the academicians which we have here mentioned, they establish two general observations, which result from what they have said with respect to the senses and the dreams of this sleep-walker.\n\n\"1. That he is obliged to open his eyes, in order to recognize objects which he wishes to see; but the impression once made, although rapidly, is vivid enough to supersede the necessity of his opening them again, to view the same objects anew; that is, the same objects are afterwards presented to his imagination with as much force and precision as if he actually saw them.\n\n\"2. That his imagination, thus warmed, represents to him objects, and such as he figures to himself, with as much vivacity as if he really saw them; and, lastly, that all his senses, being subordinate to his imagination, seem...\n"}
