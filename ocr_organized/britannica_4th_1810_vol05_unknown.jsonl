Finding his country involved in the confusion of the leaguers, he accepted of a professor's chair at Geneva, until he was patronized and employed by Henry IV.; but being afterwards stripped of his employments as a Huguenot, he at length retired to Heidelberg, from whence no offers were able to detach him. He was, however, disappointed of his intention to end his days there; for the disturbances that broke out in the Palatinate obliged him, in 1621, to take refuge in Strasbourg, where he died the following year. He wrote a great number of books; but his principal work is the Corpus Juris Civilis cum notis.\n\nGothofred, Theodore, son of the former, was born at Geneva in 1580. As soon as he had finished his studies, he went to Paris; where he conformed to the Romish religion, and applied with indefatigable industry to the study of history, that of France particularly, wherein he became very eminent, as appears by his works. In 1632, the king made him one of his historiographers, with a stipend of 3000 livres; and, in 1636, he was sent to Cologne, to assist at the treaty of peace negotiating there, on the part of France, by the cardinal of Lyons. This treaty being removed to Munster, Gothofred was sent thither, where he drew up Memoirs on the subject; and continued in that city, in the king's service, to his death in 1649. His principal work is his \"Account of the Ceremonial of the kings of France.\"\n\nGottingen, a rich and strong town of West Gothland, in Sweden, with a good harbour, at the mouth of the river Gotelba; which is the best situated for foreign trade of any in Sweden, as it lies without the Sound. It occupies the site of an ancient town, named Lode, which was built by Gustavus Vasa; and being endowed with considerable privileges, soon became the great emporium for the trade of the western provinces. Charles IX., when duke of Gothland, having in 1604 laid the foundations of a new town in the island of Hisingen at no great distance from Lode, called it Gottingen (since corrupted into Gottenburg,) in honour of his duchy. Upon his accession to the throne, he erected in his new town a trading company; drew thither many foreigners, particularly the Dutch, to whom he allowed an exemption from all duties of export and import during 20 years; a corps of English and Scotch troops, under the command of William Stewart; and granted to the Calvinists established therein the free exercise of their religion, the first place in Sweden where this toleration was permitted. The town being in 1611 reduced to ashes by the Danes, was rebuilt in the reign of Gustavus Adolphus in its present situation, and obtained a confirmation of its ancient rights, with the grant of several additional privileges.—It is built in a very singular situation. At a small distance from the sea is a marshy plain, scarcely more than half a mile in breadth, watered by the rivers Gotha and Moldal, and almost entirely enclosed with high ridges of rocks so bare and rugged, that they scarcely produce a single blade of grass, and exhibit as barren an appearance as the summits of the loftiest Alps. Gottenburg stands partly upon the ridges, and partly in the plain; and is divided from these different situations into the Upper and Lower Town. The latter is entirely level, intersected by several canals in the manner of the Dutch towns; and its houses are all constructed upon piles; the upper part hangs on the declivities; and rows of buildings rise one above the other like the seats of an amphitheatre. The whole is regularly fortified; and its circumference is near three miles, exclusive of the suburbs, called Haga, which lie toward the harbour. The streets are all uniformly straight; a few of the houses are of brick; but the generality are constructed with wood painted red. The harbour is formed by two chains of rocks, and is about a quarter of a mile in breadth. Its entrance is defended by the fort of New Elfsborg, which stands upon a small rocky island, and contains a garrison of 250 men. There has been lately established at Gottenburg a Royal Society of Sciences and Literature, upon the plan of that of Upsala.—Mr Coxe was informed by a merchant who had resided 22 years at Gottenburg, that, during that period, its population had increased considerably, and that it now contained about 30,000 inhabitants. This flourishing state is attributed to the extension of its commerce, particularly its East India Company, and the success of the herring-fishery. An English consul and several merchants of our nation reside at Gottenburg; and a chapel, with a regular chaplain, is appropriated to their use. E. Long. 11° 50'. N.

Being passionately fond of the arts, particularly painting and engraving, and desirous of engaging in them, he applied himself diligently to drawing, and made a great proficiency therein. He went to Rome to examine the works of the great masters in that city. Here he contracted an intimacy with that excellent artist Adam Elsheimer; studied his manner of pencilling, designing, and colouring; and made his works models for his own imitation. He pre-engaged all the pictures that his friend and favourite could finish, and even paid liberally for them before-hand; by which means he found himself in possession of a most desirable treasure. Those pictures which Goudt himself painted were neatly and delicately touched, in colour and pencil resembling Elsheimer, though they were in no degree equal to the paintings of that admirable master. On his return to his native country, a young woman who was in love with him, and desirous of fixing his affections upon her, gave him in his drink a love philtre: which, however, terminated in a very melancholy manner, by depriving him totally of his senses; and in the dreadful state of idiotism he dragged on a miserable life to the age of 69, his death happening in 1636. It is remarkable, that though loft to every other subject, when painting was spoken of he would discourse upon it in a very rational manner.\n\nGoudt practised engraving as well as painting, and made several beautiful prints after the pictures of Elsheimer, which are well known to the curious, and are to be met with in most choice collections. He worked with the graver only, in a very neat style; and produced a most powerful effect, not by strengthening the strokes, according to the usual method, but by crossing them with additional strokes, equally neat, and that five or six times, one over another, in the deep shadows. Considering the precision with which he executed his engravings, the freedom of handling the graver which may be discovered in them is very astonishing. The weeds and other parts of the fore-ground in that admirable print of the Ceres, are very finely expressed. The heads of the figures are correctly drawn, and the other extremities are managed in a judicious manner. The seven prints done by him, from Elsheimer, mentioned above, are, 1. Ceres drinking from a pitcher. An old woman appears holding a candle at the door of the cottage, and a boy naked standing by her is laughing and pointing at the goddess; for which contempt he was metamorphosed by her into a frog. The powerful and striking effect of this engraving cannot be properly described. This print is distinguished also by the name of the forcery. 2. The flight into Egypt: A night-scene, in which the moon and stars are introduced with great success. 3. The angel with Tobit, who is drawing a fish by his side. The back-ground is a landscape; the weeds in the fore-ground, and the branches of the trees in front, as well as the foliage and weeds hanging from them, are beautifully expressed. 4. The angel with Tobit, crossing a stream of water: The back-ground, a landscape. 5. Baucis and Philemon entertaining Jupiter and Mercury. 6. A landscape, called the Aurora, representing the dawn of day. The effect is very beautiful. 7. The beheading of St John in prison, a very small upright oval print, which is by far the rarest.\n\nGOVERNMENT, in general, is the polity of a state, or an orderly power constituted for the public good.\n\nCivil government was instituted for the preservation and advancement of men's civil interests, and for the better security of their lives, liberties, and properties. The use and necessity of government is such, that there never was an age or country without some form of civil authority: but as men are seldom unanimous in the means of attaining their ends, so their differences in opinion in relation to government have produced a variety of forms of it. To enumerate them would be to recapitulate the history of the whole earth. But, according to Montesquieu, and most other writers, they may, in general, be reduced to one of these three kinds. 1. The republican. 2. The monarchical. 3. The despotic.—The first is that, where the people in a body, or only a part of the people, have the sovereign power; the second, where one alone governs, but by fixed and established laws; but in the despotic government, one person alone, without law and without rule, directs everything by his own will and caprice. See the article LAW, No. 1, 3—10.—On the subject of government at large, see Montesquieu's L'Esprit des Lois, l. 2. c. i.; Locke, ii. 129, &c. quarto edition, 1768; Sidney on Government; Sir Thomas Smith de Republica Anglicana; and Achery's Britannic Constitution.—As to Gothic government, its original and faults, &c., see Montesquieu's L'Esprit des Lois, l. 11. c. 8.—With respect to the feudal policy, how it limited government, see Feudal System.\n\nGovernment is also a post or office, which gives a person the power or right to rule over a place, a city, or a province, either supremely or by delegation.\n\nGovernment is likewise used for the city, country, or place to which the power of governing is extended.\n\nGOUGE, an instrument used by divers artificers, being a sort of round hollow chisel; serving to cut holes, channels, grooves, &c. in wood, stone, &c.\n\nGOULART, SIMON, a famous minister of Geneva, was born at Senlis in 1543; and was one of the most indefatigable writers of his time. He made considerable additions to the Catalogue of witnesses of the truth, composed by Illyricus; and acquired a great reputation by his works; the principal of which are, 1. A translation of Seneca. 2. A collection of memorable histories. 3. A translation of St Cyprian De lappis. 4. Several devotional and moral treatises. He died at Geneva in 1628.\n\nGOURD. See Cucurbita, Botany Index.\n\nGOURGUES, DOMINIQUE DE, an illustrious French patriot.\nGow\n\nGournay patriot, a private gentleman of Galcony. The Spaniards having inhumanly massacred a colony of Frenchmen who had settled in Florida, Gourgues took a severe revenge on them, an account of which is given under the article Florida. On his return he was received with acclamations by his countrymen, but was forbidden to appear at court. Queen Elizabeth invited him to command an English fleet against the Spaniards in 1593; but he died at Tours in his way to England.\n\nGournay, a town of France, in the duchy of Normandy and territory of Bray, celebrated for its butter-market. It is situated on the river Ept, in E. Long. 0° 33'. N. Lat. 49° 25'.\n\nGournay, Mary de Jarde, a lady celebrated for her learning, was the daughter of William de Jarde, lord of Neufvi and Gournay. After the death of her father, she was protected by Montaigne and Cardinal Richelieu. To the daughter of the former she dedicated her Noegay of Pindus; and compoed several other works, the most considerable of which is Les Avis. She died at Paris in 1685, aged 80. The critics are divided concerning the reputation of this lady; some say she is styled the Syren of France; others say her works should have been buried with her.\n\nGout. See Medicine Index.\n\nGower, John, one of our most ancient English poets, was contemporary with Chaucer, and his intimate friend. Of what family, or in what country he was born, is uncertain. He studied the law, and was sometime a member of the society of Lincoln's-inn, where his acquaintance with Chaucer began. Some have asserted that he was a judge; but this is by no means certain. In the first year of Henry IV. he became blind; a misfortune which he laments in one of his Latin poems. He died in the year 1402; and was buried in St Mary Overie, which church he had rebuilt chiefly at his own expense, so that he must have lived in affluent circumstances. His tomb was magnificent, and curiously ornamented. It still remains, but hath been repaired in later times. From the collar of SS round the neck of his effigies, which lies upon the tomb, it is conjectured that he had been knighted. As to his character as a man, it is impossible, at this distance of time, to say anything with certainty. With regard to his poetical talents, he was undoubtedly admired at the time when he wrote, though a modern reader may find it difficult to discover much harmony or genius in any of his compositions. He wrote, 1. Speculum meditantis, in French, in ten books. There are two copies of this in the Bodleian library. 2. Vox clamantis, in Latin verse, in seven books. Preserved also in the Bodleian library, and in that of All-Souls. It is a chronicle of the insurrection of the commons in the reign of Richard II. 3. Confessio amantis; printed at Westminster by Caxton in 1493. Lond. 1532, 1554. It is a sort of poetical system of morality, interspersed with a variety of moral tales. 4. De rege Henrico IV. Printed in Chaucer's works. There are likewise several historical tracts, in manuscript, written by our author, which are to be found in different libraries; also some short poems printed in Chaucer's works.\n\nGown, robe, a long upper garment, worn by lawyers, divines, and other graduates; who are hence called men of the gown, or gowmen.\n\nThe gown is an ample sort of garment, worn over the ordinary clothes, hanging down to the feet. It is fashioned differently for ecclesiastics and for laymen.\n\nAt Rome they gave the name \"virile gown,\" toga virilis, to a plain kind of gown which their youth assumed when arrived at puberty. This they particularly denominated praetexta. See Toga, Praetexta, &c.\n\n\"The remarkable dress of our British ancestors (Mr Whitaker observes), which continued very nearly the same to the commencement of the last century among the natives of Ireland, and has actually descended to the present among the mountaineers of Scotland, and is therefore rendered very familiar to our ideas, carried in it an astonishing appearance to the Romans. And it seems to have been equally the dress of the men and women among the nobles of Britain. But in a few years after the erection of the Roman British towns in the north, and in the progress of refinement among them, this ancient habit began to be disesteemed by the chiefs of the cities, and looked upon as the badge of ancient barbarism. And the growing prejudices were soon to greatly improve, that within 20 years only after the construction of the towns, the British fagum was actually resigned, and the Roman toga or gown assumed by many of them.\n\n\"The gown, however, never became universal in Britain; and it seems to have been adopted only by the barons of the cities and the officers of the crown; and has therefore been transmitted to us as the robe of reverence, the ensign of literature, and the mantle of magistracy. The woollen and plaided garments of the chiefs having naturally superseeded the leathern veutres of their clients, the former were still wore by the generality of the Britons; and they were retained by the gentlemen of the country, and by the commonalty both in country and city. That this was the case, appears evident from the correspondent conduct of the Gauls and Britons; who kept their Virgata Sagula to the last, and communicated them to the Franks and Saxons. The plaided drapery of the Britons still appeared general in the streets of Manchester; and must have formed a striking contrast to the gown of the chief, the dark mantle of Italy: and it and the ornamented buttons on the shoulder are preferred among us even to the present moment, in the parti-coloured clothing and the tasseled shoulder knots of our footmen.\"\n\nIn some universities physicians wear a scarlet gown. In the Sorbonne, the doctors were always in gowns and caps. Beadles, &c., wear gowns of two or more colours.\n\nAmong the French officers, &c., they distinguish those of the short gown or robe; which are such as have not been regularly examined. They have also barbers of the short gown, who are such as are obliged to practice in an inferior way to those of the long robe.\n\nGown is also taken in the general for civil magistracy, or the profession opposite to that of arms. In this sense it was that Cicero said cedant arma toga.\n\nGowran, a borough town, in the county of Kilkenny and province of Leinster, Ireland. N. Lat.\nGOYEN, JOHN VAN, painter of landscapes, cattle, and sea pieces, was born at Leyden in 1596; and was for some time instructed by Isaac Nicholai, who was reputed a good painter; but afterwards he became the disciple of Esaias van der Velde, the most celebrated landscape painter of his time. Van Goyen very soon rose into general esteem; and his works are more universally spread through all Europe than the works of any other master, for he possessed an uncommon readiness of hand and freedom of pencil. It was his constant pleasure and practice to sketch the views of villages and towns situated on the banks of rivers or canals; of the sea-ports in the Low Countries; and sometimes of inland villages, where the scenes around them appeared to him pleasing or picturesque. Those he afterwards used as subjects for his future landscapes; enriching them with cattle, boats, and figures in character, just as the liveliness of his imagination directed. He understood perspective extremely well, and also the principles of chiaroscuro; which branches of knowledge enabled him to give his pictures a strong and agreeable effect. He died in 1656, aged 62.\n\nHis usual subjects were sea-pieces, or landscapes with views of rivers, enlivened with figures of peasants either ferrying over cattle, drawing their nets in still water, or going to or returning from market. Sometimes he represented huts of boors on the banks of rivers, with overhanging trees, and a beautiful reflection of their branches from the transparent surface of the waters. These were the subjects of his best time, which he generally marked with his name and the year; and the high finished pictures of Van Goyen will be for ever estimable. But as he painted abundance of pictures, some are flight, some too yellow, and some negligently finished; though all of them have merit, being marked with a free, expeditious, and easy pencil, and a light touch. His pictures frequently have a grayish cast; which did not arise from any mismanagement of the tints, or any want of skill in laying on the colours; but was occasioned by his using a colour called Haarlem blue, much approved of at that time, though now entirely disfused, because the artists found it apt to fade into that grayish tint; and it hath also rendered the pictures of this master exceedingly difficult to be cleaned without injuring the finer touches of the finishing. His best works are valued so highly in most parts of Europe, and especially in the Low Countries, that they deservedly afford large prices, being ranked in Holland with the pictures of Teniers; and at this time are not easily procured, particularly if they are undamaged, though his lighter performances are sufficiently common.\n\nGRAAF, REGNIER DE, a celebrated physician, born at Schoonhaven, in Holland, in 1641. He studied physic at Prussia. He was educated in Leyden, where he acquired great honour by publishing a treatise De Succo Pancreatico. He also published three pieces upon the organs of generation, both male and female; upon which subject he had a controversy with Swammerdam. He died young, in 1673; and his works, with his life prefixed, were published at Leyden in Grabe 1677, in 8vo.\n\nGRABE, JOHN ERNEST, a very learned writer in the beginning of the 18th century, a native of Konigsberg, in Prussia. He was educated in the Lutheran religion; but the reading of the fathers led him into doubts. He presented to the electoral consistory at Sambia in Prussia a memorial containing his doubts. The elector gave orders to three eminent divines to answer them. Their answers shook him a little in his resolution of embracing the Roman Catholic religion; and one of them, Spener, advised him to go to England. He went; and King William gave him a pension, which was continued by Queen Anne. He was ordained a priest of the church of England, and honoured with the degree of doctor of divinity by the university of Oxford; upon which occasion Dr George Smalridge pronounced two Latin orations, which were afterwards printed. He wrote, 1. Pseudepigrammum S. S. Patrum, ut et Hereticorum seculi post Christum natum, 8vo. 2. An edition of the Septuagint, from the Alexandrian manuscript in St James's library. 3. Notes on Justin, &c.; and other works, which are esteemed by the learned.\n\nGRACCHUS, TIBERIUS, elected tribune of the Roman people, demanded in the senate, in their name, the execution of the Agrarian law; by which all persons possessing above 200 acres of land were to be deprived of the surplus, for the benefit of the poor citizens, amongst whom an equal distribution of them was to be made. Having carried his plan into execution by violent measures, he fell a victim to his zeal, being assassinated by his own party, 133 B.C. Caius his brother, pursuing the same steps, was killed by the consul Opimius, 121 B.C. See (history of) Rome.\n\nGRACE, among divines, is taken, 1. For the free love and favour of God, which is the spring and source of all the benefits we receive from him. 2. For the work of the Spirit renewing the soul after the image of God; and continually guiding and strengthening the believer to obey his will, to resist and mortify sin, and overcome it.\n\nGrace is also used, in a peculiar sense, for a short prayer said before and after meat.\n\nThe proofs of the moral obligation of this ceremony, drawn from different passages of the New Testament, are so well known, that it is needless to insist on them here. Some others, drawn from the practice of different nations, and of very remote antiquity, may not be disagreeable to our readers.\n\n1. Athenaeus tells us, in his Deipnosoph. lib. ii. that in the famous regulation made by Amphictyon king of Athens with respect to the use of wine, both in sacrifices and at home, he required that the name of Jupiter the Sufferer should be decently and reverently pronounced. The same writer, in lib. iv. p. 149, quotes Hermeias, an author extant in his time, who informs us of a people in Egypt, inhabitants of the city of Naucratis, whose custom it was on certain occasions, after they had placed themselves in the usual posture of eating at the table, to rise again and kneel; when the priest or precentor of the solemnity began to chant a grace, according to a stated form amongst them; and when that was over, they joined in the meal in a solemn sacrificial manner. Heliodorus has a passage...\npallage in his *Ethiopics* to the same purpose, that it was the custom of the Egyptian philosophers to pour out libations and put up ejaculations before they sat down to meals. Porphyry, in his treatise *De abstin.* lib. iv. p. 458., gives a great character of the Samæan gymnosophists in Egypt for the strictness of their life: as one article in their favour, he observes, that at the founding of a bell before their meals, which consisted only of rice, bread, fruits, and herbs, they went to prayers; which being ended, and not before, the bell founded again, and they sat down to eating. In general this was a religious usage or rite among the ancient Greeks; and derived from yet older ages, if Clement of Alexandria rightly informs us. He mentions, that these people when they met together to refresh themselves with the juice of the grape, sung a piece of music, in imitation of the Hebrew psalms, which they called a scholion. Livy, lib. xxxix. speaks of it as a settled custom among the old Romans, that they offered sacrifice and prayer to the gods at their meals and comports. But one of the fullest testimonies to our purpose is given by Quintilian, *Declam.* 301. *Adiﬁi meniam*, says he, *ad quam cum venire capitum, Deos invocamus*; \"We approached the table (at supper together), and then invoked the gods.\"\n\nThe Jesuit Trigautius, in his very elegant and instructive narrative of the Christian expedition of their missionaries into China, book i. p. 69. gives this account of the people there in the particular now under consideration. \"Before they place themselves for partaking of an entertainment, the person who makes it sets a vessel, either of gold, or silver, or marble, or some such valuable material, in a charger full of wine, which he holds with both his hands, and then makes a low bow to the person of chief quality or character at the table. Then from the hall or dining-room, he goes into the porch or entry, where he again makes a very low bow, and turning his face to the south, pours out this wine upon the ground as a thankful oblation to the Lord of heaven. After this, repeating his reverential obeisance, he returns into the hall,\" &c.\n\nThe Turks pray for a blessing on their meat; and many more instances might be produced of infidels who have constantly observed the like custom in some way or other.\n\n2. The fact, therefore, with respect to the heathen world, being thus evident, we proceed to the sentiments and behaviour of the Jews in this particular. Their celebrated historian Josephus, giving a detail of the rites and customs of the Essenes, who were confessedly the strictest and most pious professors of the Jewish religion, has this remarkable passage to the present purpose: \"The priest,\" says he, \"begs a blessing before they presume to take any nourishment; and it is looked upon as a great sin to take or taste before.\" Then follows the thanksgiving before meat: and \"when the meal,\" proceeds he, \"is over, the priest prays again; and the company with him bless and praise God as their preserver, and the donor of their life and nourishment.\"\n\nPhilo, in his book *De vita contemplativa*, gives an account of a body of men and women stricter than even the Essenes themselves. He distinguishes them by no particular name, though his relation is very accurate and circumstantial; namely, that on certain special occasions, before \"they took their meals, they placed themselves in a proper decent order; when, lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven, they prayed to God that he would be pleased to be propitious to them in the use of those his good creatures.\"\n\nFrom the Hebrew ritual it appears, that the Jews had their hymns and psalms of thanksgiving, not only after eating their passover, but on a variety of other occasions, at and after meals, and even between their several courses and dishes; as when the best of their wine was brought upon the table, or their aromatic concoctions, or the fruit of the garden, &c. On the day of the passover was sung Psalm cxiv. \"When Israel came out of Egypt,\" &c.\n\nArrietus has a passage full on the present subject. \"Moses,\" says he, \"commands that when the Jews are going to eat or drink, the company should immediately join in sacrifice or prayer.\" Where Rabbi Eleazar (upon that author) met with this sentence, has been controverted. But supposing it not to be found in *scriptis*, it is sufficient for us to know that the Jews did constantly practise this custom, upon the foundation of an ancient and general tradition and usage. That the prophet Daniel gave thanks before meat, is evident from the Apocryphal book concerning Bel and the Dragon, where, ver. 38, 39, we find, that \"Daniel said, Thou hast remembered me, O God! neither hast thou forsaken them who seek thee and love thee. So Daniel arose, and did eat.\" Of this text Prudentia takes notice in Cathemerin, hymn iv.\n\n*His sumptis Danielis excitavit*\n*In caluit faciem, ciboque fortis,*\n*Amen reddidit, allelujah dixit.*\n*The much-belov'd took the repast,*\n*And up to heav'n his eyes he cast;*\n*By which refresh'd, he sung aloud,*\n*Amen, and allelujah to his God.*\n\nWhere, by the way, it may be observed, that the poet is a little mistaken in making the prophet give thanks after meat; whereas, according to the text, he did it before.\n\nGrace, or Gracefulness, in the human character; an agreeable attribute, inseparable from motion as opposed to rest, and as comprehending speech, looks, gesture, and loco-motion.\n\nAs some motions are homely, the opposite to graceful; it is to be inquired, With what motions is this attribute connected? No man appears graceful in a mask; and therefore, laying aside the expressions of the countenance, the other motions may be genteel, may be elegant, but of themselves never are graceful. A motion adjusted in the most perfect manner to answer its end, is elegant; but still somewhat more is required to complete our idea of grace or gracefulness.\n\nWhat this unknown more may be, is the nice point. One thing is clear from what is said, that this more must arise from the expressions of the countenance; and from what expressions so naturally as from those which indicate mental qualities, such as sweetness, benevolence, elevation, dignity? This promises to be a fair analysis: because of all objects mental qualities affect us the most; and\nand the impression made by graceful appearance upon every spectator of taste, is too deep for any cause purely corporeal.\n\nThe next step is, to examine what are the mental qualities, that, in conjunction with elegance of motion, produce a graceful appearance. Sweetness, cheerfulness, affability, are not separately sufficient, nor even in conjunction. Dignity alone, with elegant motion, produce a graceful appearance; but still more graceful with the aid of other qualities, those especially that are the most exalted. See DIGNITY.\n\nBut this is not all. The most exalted virtues may be the lot of a person whose countenance has little expression: such a person cannot be graceful. Therefore to produce this appearance, we must add another circumstance, viz. an expressive countenance, displaying to every spectator of taste, with life and energy, everything that passes in the mind.\n\nCollecting these circumstances together, grace may be defined, \"that agreeable appearance which arises from elegance of motion and from a countenance expressive of dignity.\" Expressions of other mental qualities are not essential to that appearance, but they heighten it greatly.\n\nOf all external objects, a graceful person is the most agreeable.\n\nDancing affords great opportunity for displaying grace, and haranguing still more. See DANCING, DECLAMATION, and ORATORY.\n\nBut in vain will a person attempt to be graceful who is deficient in amiable qualities. A man, it is true, may form an idea of qualities he is destitute of; and, by means of that idea, may endeavour to express these qualities by looks and gestures: but such studied expression will be too faint and obscure to be graceful.\n\nAct of Grace, the appellation given to the act of parliament 1696, c. 32, which allows prisoners for civil debts to be set at liberty, upon making oath that they have not therewithal to support themselves in prison, unless they are alimented by the creditors on whose diligences they were imprisoned, within ten days after intimation made for that purpose.\n\nDays of Grace, three days immediately following the term of payment of a bill, within which the creditor must protest it if payment is not obtained, in order to entitle him to recourse against the drawer.\n\nGrace is also a title of dignity given to dukes, archbishops, and in Germany to barons and other inferior princes.\n\nGraces, Gratiae, Charites, in the heathen theology, were fabulous deities, three in number, who attended on Venus. Their names are, Aglia, Thalia, and Euphrosyne; i.e. shining, flourishing, and gay; or, according to some authors, Pasitha, Euphrosyne, and Aegiale. They were supposed by some to be the daughters of Jupiter and Eurynome the daughter of Oceanus; and by others, to be the daughters of Bacchus and Venus.\n\nSome will have the Graces to have been four; and make them the same with the Hours (\"hours\"), or rather with the four seasons of the year. A marble in the king of Prussia's cabinet represents the three Graces in the usual manner, with a fourth seated and covered with a large veil, with the words underneath, Ad Sores IIII. But this group we may understand to be the three Graces, and Venus, who was their sister, as Gracilis being daughter of Jupiter and Dione.\n\nThe graces are always supposed to have hold of each other's hands, and never parted. They were painted naked, to show that the Graces borrow nothing from art, and that they have no other beauties than what are natural.\n\nYet in the first ages they were not represented naked, as appears from Pausanias, lib. vi. and lib. ix. who describes their temple and statues. They were of wood, all but their head, feet, and hands, which were white marble. Their robe or gown was gilt: one of them held in her hand a rose, another a dye, and the third a sprig of myrtle.\n\nGRACILIS, a muscle of the leg, thus called from its slender shape.

In the 24th year of his age, the elector of Brandenburg made him professor at Dörfelburg. In 1658, he was invited to Deventer to succeed his former master Gronovius. In 1661, he was appointed professor of eloquence at Utrecht; and 12 years after he had the professorship of politics and history conferred on him. He fixed his thoughts here, and refused several advantageous offers. He had, however, the satisfaction to be sought after by divers princes, and to see several of them come from Germany to study under him. He died in 1703, aged 71. His Theaurus antiquitatum et historiarum Italicae, &c., and other works are well known.\n\nGRAFTING, or ENGRAFTING, in Gardening, is the taking a shoot from one tree, and inserting it into another, in such a manner that both may unite closely and become one tree. By the ancient writers on horticulture and gardening, this operation is called incision, to distinguish it from inoculation or budding, which they call inferere oculos.\n\nGrafting has been practised from the most remote antiquity;\nantiquity; but its origin and invention is differently related by naturalists. Theophrastus tells us, that a bird having swallowed a fruit whole, cast it forth into a cleft or cavity of a rotten tree; where mixing with some of the putrid parts of the wood, and being washed with the rains, it budded, and produced within this tree another tree of a different kind. This led the husbandman to certain reflections, from which soon afterwards arose the art of engraving. For the different methods of performing this operation, see GARDENING Index.\n\nGRAHAM, JAMES, Marquis of Montrose, was comparable to the greatest heroes of antiquity. He undertook, against almost every obstacle that could terrify a less enterprising genius, to reduce the kingdom of Scotland to the obedience of the king; and his success was answerable to the greatness of the undertaking. By valour, he in a few months, almost effectuated his design; but, for want of supplies, was forced to abandon his conquests. After the death of Charles I, he, with a few men, made a second attempt, but was immediately defeated by a numerous army. As he was leaving the kingdom in disguise, he was betrayed into the hands of his enemy, by the Lord Afton, his intimate friend. He was carried to his execution with every circumstance of indignity that wanton cruelty could invent; and hanged upon a gibbet 30 feet high, with the book of his exploits appended to his neck. He bore this reverse of fortune with his usual greatness of mind, and expressed a just scorn at the rage and the insult of his enemies. We meet with many instances of valour in this active reign; but Montrose is the only instance of heroism. He was executed May 21, 1650. See BRITAIN, No 137, 138, 142, 165.\n\nGRAHAM, Sir Richard, lord viscount Preston, eldest son of Sir George Graham of Netherby, in Cumberland, Bart. was born in 1648. He was sent ambassador by Charles II, to Louis XIV, and was master of the wardrobe and secretary of state under James II. But when the revolution took place, he was tried and condemned, on an accusation of attempting the restoration of that prince; though he obtained a pardon by the queen's intercession. He spent the remainder of his days in retirement, and published an elegant translation of \"Boethius on the consolation of philosophy.\" He died in 1695.\n\nGRAHAM, George, clock and watch-maker, the most ingenious and accurate artist in his time, was born in 1675. After his apprenticeship, Mr Tompion received him into his family, purely on account of his merit; and treated him with a kind of parental affection as long as he lived. Besides his universally acknowledged skill in his profession, he was a complete mechanic and astronomer; the great mural arch in the observatory at Greenwich was made for Dr Halley, under his immediate inspection, and divided by his own hand; and from this incomparable original, the best foreign instruments of the kind are copies made by English artists. The sector by which Dr Bradley first discovered two new motions in the fixed stars, was of his invention and fabric; and when the French academicians were sent to the north to ascertain the figure of the earth, Mr Graham was thought the fittest person in Europe to supply them with instruments; those who went to the south were not so well furnished. He was for many years a member of the Royal Society, to which he communicated several ingenious and important discoveries; and regarded the advancement of science more than the accumulation of wealth. He died in 1751.\n\nGRAHAM'S Dyke. See ANTONINUS'S Wall.\n\nGRAIN, corn of all sorts, as barley, oats, rye, &c.

See ORNITHOLOGY.\n\nGRAMINA, GRASSES; one of the seven tribes or natural families, into which all vegetables are distributed by Linnaeus in his Philosophia Botanica. They are defined to be plants which have very simple leaves, a jointed stem, a husky calyx termed gluma, and a single seed. This description includes the several sorts of corn as well as grasses. In Tournefort they constitute a part of the fifteenth class, termed apetali; and in Linnaeus's sexual method, they are mostly contained in the second order of the third class, called triandra digynia.\n\nThis numerous and natural family of the grasses has engaged the attention and researches of several eminent botanists. The principal of these are, Ray, Monti, Michelii, and Linnaeus.\n\nM. Monti, in his Catalogus stirpium agri Bononiensis graminum ac hyjus modi-affinis complectens, printed at Bologna in 1719, divides the grasses from the disposition of their flowers, as Theophrastus and Ray have divided them before him, into three sections or orders.—These are, 1. Grasses having flowers collected in a spike. 2. Grasses having their flowers collected in a panicle or loose spike. 3. Plants that in their habit and external appearance are allied to the grasses.\n\nThis class would have been natural if the author had not improperly introduced sweet-rush, juncus, and arrow-headed grass, into the third section. Monti enumerates about 306 species of the grasses, which he reduces under Tournefort's genera; to these he has added three new genera.\n\nScheuchzer, in his Aridographia, published likewise in 1719, divides the grasses, as Monti, from the disposition of their flowers, into the five following sections: 1. Grasses with flowers in a spike, as phalaris, anthoxanthum, and frumentum. 2. Irregular grasses, as schoenanthus, and cornucopiae. 3. Grasses with flowers growing in a simple panicle or loose spike, as reed and millet. 4. Grasses with flowers growing in a compound panicle, or diffused spike, as oats and poa. 5. Plants by their habit nearly allied to the grasses, as cypres-grass, scirpus, linagroitis, ruth, and scheuchzeria.\n\nScheuchzer has enumerated about four hundred species, which he describes with amazing exactness.\nMicheli has divided the grasses into six sections, which contain in all 44 genera, and are arranged from the situation and number of the flowers.\n\nGramina, the name of the fourth order in Linnaeus's Fragments of a Natural Method, consisting of the numerous and natural family of the grasses, viz. agrostis, aira, alopecurus or fox-tail grass, anthoxanthum or vernal grass, arifida, arundo or reed, avena or oats, boharta, briza, bromus, cinna, cornucopiae or horn of plenty grass, cynosurus, dactylis, clymus, festuca or fescue-grass, hordeum or barley, lagurus or hare's-tail grass, lolium or darnel, lygeum or hooded matweed, Gramina melica, milium or millet, nardus, oryza or rice, panicum or panic-grass, paspalum, phalaris or canary-grass, phleum, poa, saccharum or sugar-cane, secale or rye, flupa or winged spike-grass, triticum or wheat, uniola or foxtail oats of Carolina, coix or Job's tears, olyra, pharus, triplicum, zea, Indian Turkey wheat or Indian corn, zizania, agilops or wild fescue-grass, andropogon, apulida, cenchrus, holcus or Indian millet, ichneumon. See Botany.\n\nGRAMMAR.\n\n1. Grammar is the art of speaking or of writing any language with propriety; and the purpose of language is to communicate our thoughts.\n\n2. Grammar, considered as an art, necessarily supposes the previous existence of language; and as its design is to teach any language to those who are ignorant of it, it must be adapted to the genius of that particular language of which it treats. A just method of grammar, therefore, without attempting any alterations in a language already introduced, furnishes certain observations called rules, to which the methods of speaking used in that language may be reduced; and this collection of rules is called the grammar of that particular language. For the greater distinctness with regard to these rules, grammarians have usually divided this subject into four distinct heads, viz. Orthography, or the art of combining letters into syllables, and syllables into words; Etymology, or the art of deducing one word from another, and the various modifications by which the sense of any one word can be diversified consistently with its original meaning or its relation to the theme whence it is derived; Syntax, or what relates to the construction or due disposition of the words of a language into sentences or phrases; and Prosody, or that which treats of the quantities and accents of syllables, and the art of making verses.\n\n3. But grammar, considered as a science, views language only as it is significant of thought. Neglecting particular and arbitrary modifications introduced for the sake of beauty or elegance, it examines the analogy and relation between words and ideas; distinguishes between those particulars which are essential to language and those which are only accidental; and thus furnishes a certain standard, by which different languages may be compared, and their several excellencies or defects pointed out. This is what is called Philosophic or Universal Grammar.\n\n4. The origin of language is a subject which has employed much learned investigation, and about which there is still a diversity of opinion. The design of speech is to communicate to others the thoughts and perceptions of the mind of the speaker; but it is obvious, that between an internal idea and any external sound there is no natural relation; that the word fire, for instance, might have denominated the substance which we call ice, and that the word ice might have signified fire. Some of the most acute feelings of man, as well as of every other animal, are indeed expressed by simple inarticulate sounds, which as they tend to the preservation of the individual or the continuance of the species, and invariably indicate either pain or pleasure, are universally understood; but these inarticulate and insignificant sounds are very few in number; and if they can with any propriety be said to constitute a natural and universal language, it is a language of which man as a mere sentient being partakes in common with the other animals.\n\n5. Man is endowed not only with sensation, but also with the faculty of reasoning; and simple inarticulate sounds are insufficient for expressing all the various modifications of thought, for communicating to others a chain of argumentation, or even for distinguishing between the different sensations either of pain or of pleasure: a man scorched with fire or unexpectedly plunged among ice, might utter the cry naturally indicative of sudden and violent pain; the cry would be the same, or nearly the same, but the sensations of cold and heat are widely different. Articulation, by which those simple sounds are modified, and a particular meaning fixed to each modification, is therefore absolutely necessary to such a being as man, and forms the language which distinguishes him from all other animals, and enables him to communicate with facility all that diversity of ideas with which his mind is stored, to make known his particular wants, and to distinguish with accuracy all his various sensations. Those sounds thus modified are called words; and as words have confessedly no natural relation to the ideas and perceptions of which they are significant, the use of them must either have been the result of human sagacity, or have been suggested to the first man by the Author of nature.\n\n6. Whether language be of divine or human origin, is a question upon which, though it might perhaps be soon resolved, it is not necessary here to enter. Upon either supposition, the first language, compared with those which succeeded it, or even with itself as afterwards enlarged, must have been extremely rude and narrow.\nmodifications of thought, for communicating to others a chain of argumentation, or even for distinguishing be-\nthose which succeeded it, or even with itself as afterwards enlarged, must have been extremely rude and narrow.\nDivision narrow. If it was of human contrivance, this will be readily granted; for what art was ever invented and brought to a state of perfection by illiterate savages? If it was taught by God, which is at least the more probable supposition, we cannot imagine that it would be more comprehensive than the ideas of those for whose immediate use it was intended; that the first men should have been taught to express pains or pleasures which they never felt, or to utter sounds that should be afterwards significant of ideas which at the time of utterance had not occurred to the mind of the speaker: man, taught the elements of language, would be able himself to improve and enlarge it as his future occasions should require.\n\n7. As all language is composed of significant words variously combined, a knowledge of them is necessary previous to our acquiring an adequate idea of language as constructed into sentences and phrases. But as it is by words that we express the various ideas which occur to the mind, it is necessary to examine how ideas themselves are suggested, before we can ascertain the various classes into which words may be distributed. It is the province of logic to trace our ideas from their origin, as well as to teach the art of reasoning; but it is necessary at present to observe, that our earliest ideas are all ideas of sensation, excited by the impressions that are made upon our organs of sense by the various objects with which we are surrounded. Let us therefore suppose a reasonable being, devoid of every possible prepossession, placed upon this globe; and it is obvious, that his attention would in the first place be directed to the various objects which he saw existing around him. These he would naturally endeavour to distinguish from one another; and if he were either learning or inventing a language, his first effort would be to give them names, by means of which the ideas of them might be recalled when the objects themselves should be absent. This is one copious source of words; and forms a natural class which must be common to every language, and which is distinguished by the name of nouns; and as these nouns are the names of the several substances which exist, they have likewise been called substantives.\n\n8. It would likewise be early discovered, that every one of these substances was endowed with certain qualities or attributes; to express which another class of words would be requisite, since it is only by their qualities that substances themselves can attract our attention. Thus, to be weighty, is a quality of matter; to think, is an attribute of man. Therefore in every language words have been invented to express the known qualities or attributes of the several objects which exist.\n\nVOL. X. Part I.\n\n(A) This is the doctrine of many writers on the theory of language, for whose judgment we have the highest respect: yet it is not easy to conceive mankind so far advanced in the art of abstraction as to view attributes by themselves independent of particular substances, and to give one general name to each attribute wherever it may be found, without having at the same time words expressive of affirmation. We never talk of any attribute, a colour for instance, without affirming something concerning it; as, either that it is bright or faint, or that it is the colour of some substance. It will be seen afterwards, that to denote affirmation is the proper office of what is called the substantive verb; as, \"Milk is white.\" That verb therefore appears to be as necessary to the communication of thought as any species of words whatever; and if we must range words under a few general classes, we should be inclined to say, that nouns, attributives, and affirmatives, comprehend all that is essential to language.\nwith the stones, it neither acquires nor loses any one of\nthe qualities essential to matter; it neither communicates\nits own softness, nor acquires their hardness. By this\nmode of reasoning therefore it would appear, that the\nwords called definitives and connectives, so far from ha-\nving of themselves no signification, are equally essen-\ntial to language and equally significant with those\nwhich are denominated substantive and attributives; and\nupon investigation it will be found that this is the truth.\nFor whatever is meant by the definition or connection of\nthe words which all men confess to be significant, that\nmeaning must be the sense of the words of which the\npurpose is to define and connect; and as there can be\nno meaning where there are no ideas, every one of these\ndefinitives and connectives must be significant of some idea,\nalthough it may not be always easy or even possible to\nexpress that idea by another word.\n\n11. These different modes of dividing the parts of\nspeech we have just mentioned, because they have been\nlargely treated of by grammarians of high fame. But\nit does not appear to us, that any man can feel himself\nmuch the wiser for having learned that all words\nare either substantives or attributives, definitives or connectives. The division of words into\nthose which are significant of themselves, and\nthose which are significant by relation, is abso-\nlute nonsense, and has been productive of much error\nand much mystery in some of the most celebrated trea-\ntises on grammar. It is indeed probable, that any at-\ntempt to establish a different classification of the parts\nof speech from that which is commonly received, will\nbe found of little utility either in practice or in speculation. As far as the former is concerned, the vulgar\ndivision seems sufficiently commodious; for every man\nwho knows anything, knows when he uses a noun\nand when a verb. With respect to the latter, not to\nmention that all the grammarians from Aristotle to\nHorne Tooke, have differed on the subject, it should\nseem to be of more importance, after having ascertained\nwith precision the nature of each species of words,\nto determine in what circumstances they differ than in\nwhat they agree.\n\n12. In most languages, probably in all cultivated\nlanguages, grammarians distinguish the following parts\nof speech: Noun, pronoun, verb, participle, adverb, pre-\nposition, conjunction. The Latin and English grammati-\ncians admit the interjection among the parts of speech,\nalthough it is confessedly not necessary to the construc-\ntion of the sentence, being only thrown in to express\nthe affection of the speaker: and in the Greek and\nEnglish tongues there is the article prefixed to nouns,\nwhen they signify the common names of things, to\npoint them out, and to show how far their signification\nextends. In the method of arrangement commonly\nfollowed in grammars, adjectives are clasped with sub-\nstantives, and both are denominated nouns; but it is cer-\ntain that, when examined philosophically, an essential\ndifference is discovered between the substantive and the\nadjective; and therefore some writers of eminence, when\ntreating of this subject, have lately given the following\nclassification of words, which we shall adopt: The\narticle, noun, pronoun, verb, participle, adjec-\ntive, adverb, preposition, conjunction, inter-\njection. All these words are to be found in the En-\nglish language; and therefore we shall examine each\nclass, endeavour to ascertain its precise import, and show\nin what respects it differs from every other class. It is\nimpossible to investigate the principles of grammar\nwithout confining the investigation in a great measure\nto some particular language from which the illustrations\nmust be produced; and that we should prefer the Eng-\nlish language for this purpose can excite no wonder, as\nit is a preference which to every tongue is due from\nthose by whom it is spoken. We trust, however, that\nthe principles which we shall establish will be found to\napply universally; and that our inquiry, though princi-\npally illustrated from the English language, will be an\ninquiry into philosophical or universal grammar.\n\nChap. I. Of the Noun or Substantive.\n\n13. Nouns are all those words by which objects or\nsubstances are denominated, and which distinguish them\nfrom one another, without marking either quantity, qua-\nlity, action, or relation. The substantive or noun is the\nname of the thing spoken of, and in Greek and Latin\nis called name; for it is vox in the one, and nomen in\nthe other; and if in English we had called it the\nname rather than the noun, the appellation would per-\nhaps have been more proper, as this last word, being\nused only in grammar, is more liable to be misunder-\nstood than the other, which is in constant and familiar\nuse. That nouns or the names of things must make a\npart of every language, and that they must have been\nthe words first suggested to the human mind, will not\nbe disputed. Men could not speak of themselves or\nof anything else, without having names for themselves\nand the various objects with which they are surrounded.\nNow, as all the objects which exist must be either in\nthe same state in which they were produced by nature,\nor changed from their original state by art, or abstract-\ned from substances by the powers of imagination, and\nconceived by the mind as having at least the capacity\nof being characterized by qualities; this naturally sug-\ngests a division of nouns into natural, as man, vege-\ntable, tree, &c., artificial, as house, ship, watch, &c.,\nand abstract, as whiteness, motion, temperance, &c.\n\n14. But the diversity of objects is so great, that had\neach individual a distinct and proper name, it would be\nimpossible for the most tenacious memory, during the\ncourse of the longest life, to retain even the nouns of\nthe narrowest language. It has therefore been found expedient, when a number of things resemble each other,\nin some important particulars, to arrange them\nall under one species; to which is given a name that\nbelongs equally to the whole species, and to each in-\ndividual comprehended under it. Thus the word man\ndenotes a species of animals, and is equally applicable to\nevery human being: The word horse denotes another\nspecies of animals, and is equally applicable to every in-\ndividual of that species of quadrupeds; but it cannot\nbe applied to the species of men, or to any individual\ncomprehended under that species. We find, however,\nthat there are some qualities in which several spe-\ncies resemble each other; and therefore we refer\nthem to a higher order called a genus, to which we give\na name that is equally applicable to every species and\nevery individual comprehended under it. Thus, men\nand horses and all living things on earth resemble each\nother in this respect, that they have life. We refer\nthem therefore to the genus called animal; and this world belongs to every species of animals, and to each individual animal. The same classification is made both of artificial and abstract substances; of each of which there are genera, species, and individuals. Thus in natural substances, animal, vegetable, and fowl, denote genera; man, horse, tree, metal, a species; and Alexander, Bacchus, oak, gold, are individuals. In artificial substances, edifice is a genus; house, church, tower, are species; and the Vatican, St Paul's, and the Tower of London, are individuals. In abstract substances, motion and virtue are genera; flight and temperance are species; the flight of Malomet and temperance in wine are individuals. By arranging substances in this manner, and giving a name to each genus and species, the nouns necessary to any language are comparatively few and easily acquired; and when we meet with an object unknown to us, we have only to examine it with attention; and comparing it with other objects, to refer it to the genus or species which it most nearly resembles. By this contrivance we supply the want of a proper name for the individual; and so far as the resemblance is complete between it and the species to which it is referred, and of which we have given it the name, we may converse and reason about it without danger of error: Whereas had each individual in nature a distinct and proper name, words would be innumerable and incomprehensible; and to employ our labours in language, would be as idle as that study of numberless written symbols which has been attributed to the Chinese.\n\n15. Although nouns are thus adapted to express not the individuals but the genera or species into which substances are clasped; yet, in speaking of these substances, whether natural, artificial, or abstract, all men must have occasion to mention sometimes one of a kind, and sometimes more than one. In every language, therefore, nouns must admit of some variation in their form, to denote unity and plurality; and this variation is called number. Thus in the English language, when we speak of a single place of habitation, we call it a house; but if of more, we call them houses. In the first of these cases the noun is said to be in the singular, in the last case it is in the plural, number. Greek nouns have also a dual number to express two individuals, as have likewise some Hebrew nouns: but this variation is evidently not essential to language; and it is perhaps doubtful whether it ought to be considered as an elegance or a deformity.\n\n16. But although number be a natural accident of nouns, it can only be considered as essential to those which denote genera or species. Thus we may have occasion to speak of one animal or of many animals, of one man, or of many men; and therefore the nouns animal and man must be capable of expressing plurality as well as unity. But this is not the case with respect to the proper names of individuals: for we can only lay Xenophon, Aristotle, Plato, &c., in the singular; as, were any one of these names to assume a plural form, it would cease to be the proper name of an individual, and become the common name of a species. Of this, indeed, we have some examples in every language. When a proper name is considered as a general appellative under which many others are arranged, it is then no longer the name of an individual but of a species, and as such admits of a plural; as the Cæsars, the Howards, the Pelhams, the Montagues, &c.; but Socrates can never become plural; to long as we know of no more than one man of that name. The reason of all this will be obvious, if we consider, that every genus may be found whole and entire in each of its species; for man, horse, and dog, are each of them an entire and complete animal: and every species may be found whole and entire in each of its individuals: for Socrates, Plato, and Xenophon, are each of them completely and entirely a man. Hence it is, that every genus, though one, is multiplied into many; and every species, though one, is also multiplied into many; by reference to those beings which are their subordinates: But as no individual has any such subordinates, it can never in strictness be considered as many; and so, as well in nature as in name, is truly an individual which cannot admit of number.\n\n17. Besides number, another characteristic, visible in all gender, substances, is that of sex. Every substance is either male or female; or both male and female; or neither one nor the other. So that with respect to sexes and their negation, all substances conceivable are comprehended under this fourfold consideration, which language would be very imperfect if it could not express. Now the existence of hermaphrodites being rare, if not doubtful, and language being framed to answer the ordinary occasions of life, no provision is made, in any of the tongues with which we are acquainted, for expressing, otherwise than by a name made on purpose, or by a periphrasis, duplicity of sex. With regard to this great natural characteristic, grammarians have made only a threefold distinction of nouns: those which denote males are said to be of the masculine gender; those which denote females, of the feminine; and those which denote substances that admit not of sex, are said to be neuter or of neither gender. All animals have sex; and therefore the names of all animals should have gender. But the sex of all is not equally obvious, nor equally worthy of attention. In those species that are most common, or of which the male and female are, by their size, form, colour, or other outward circumstances, eminently distinguished, the male is sometimes called by one name, which is masculine; and the female by a different name, which is feminine. Thus in English we say, husband, wife; king, queen; father, mother; son, daughter, &c. In others of similar distinction, the name of the male is applied to the female only by prefixing a syllable or by altering the termination; as man, woman; lion, lioness; emperor, empress; anciently emperors; master, mistress; anciently masters, &c. When the sex of any animal is not obvious, or not material to be known, the same name, in some languages, is applied, without variation, to all the species, and that name is said to be of the common gender. Thus in Latin bos albus is a white ox, and bos alba a white cow. Diminutive insects, though they are doubtless male and female, seem to be considered in the English language as if they were really creeping things. No man, speaking of a worm, would say he creeps, but it creeps, upon the ground. But although the origin of genders is thus clear and obvious; yet the English is the only language, with which we are acquainted, that deviates not, except in a very few instances, from the order of nature. Greek and Latin, and many of the modern tongues, have nouns,\nNoun. some masculine, some feminine, which denote substances where sex never had existence. Nay, some languages are so particularly defective in this respect, as to clas every object, inanimate as well as animate, under either the masculine or the feminine gender, as they have no neuter gender for those which are of neither sex. This is the case with the Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish. But the English, strictly following the order of nature, puts every noun which denotes a male animal, and no other, in the masculine gender; every name of a female animal, in the feminine; and every animal whose sex is not obvious, or known, as well as every inanimate object whatever, in the neuter gender. And this gives our language an advantage above most others in the poetical and rhetorical style: for when nouns naturally neuter are converted into masculine and feminine, the personification is more distinctly and more forcibly marked. (See Personification.) Some very learned and ingenious men have endeavoured, by what they call a more subtle kind of reasoning, to discern even in things without sex a distant analogy to that natural distinction, and to account for the names of inanimate substances being, in Greek and Latin, masculine and feminine. But such speculations are wholly fanciful; and the principles upon which they proceed are overturned by an appeal to facts. Many of the substances that, in one language, have masculine names, have in others names that are feminine; which could not be the case were this matter regulated by reason or nature. Indeed for this, as well as many other anomalies in language, no other reason can be assigned than that custom.\n\nQuem penes arbitrium est, et jus, et norma, loquendi.\n\n18. It has been already observed that most nouns are the names, not of individuals, but of whole classes of objects termed genera and species (b). In clasping a number of individuals under one species, we contemplate only those qualities which appear to be important, and in which the several individuals are found to agree, abstracting the mind from the consideration of all those which appear to be less essential, and which in one individual may be such as have nothing exactly similar in any other individual upon earth. Thus, in clasping the individuals which are comprehended under the species denominated horse, we pay no regard to their colour or the size; because experience teaches us, that no particular colour or size is essential to that individual living creature, and that there are not perhaps upon earth two horses whose colour and size are exactly alike. But the qualities which in this process we take into view, are the general shape, the symmetry, and proportion of the parts; and in short every thing which appears evidently essential to the life of the individual and the propagation of the race. All these qualities are strikingly similar in all the individuals which we call horses, and as strikingly dissimilar from the corresponding qualities of every other individual animal. The colour of a horse is often the same with that of an ox; but the shape of the one animal, the symmetry and proportion of his parts, are totally different from those of the other; nor could any man be led to clas the two individuals under the same species. It is by a similar process that we ascend from one species to another, and through all the species to the highest genus. In each species or genus in the ascending series fewer particular qualities are attended to than were considered as essential to the genus or species immediately below it; and our conceptions become more and more general as the particular qualities, which are the objects of them, become fewer in number. The use of a general term, therefore, can recall to the mind only the common qualities of the clas, the genus or species which it represents. But we have frequent occasion to speak of individual objects. In doing this, we annex to the general term certain words significant of particular qualities, which discriminate the object of which we speak, from every other individual of the clas to which it belongs, and of which the general term is the common name. For instance, in adverting a thief, we are obliged to mention his height, complexion, gait, and whatever may serve to distinguish him from all other men.\n\nThe process of the mind in rendering her conceptions particular, is indeed exactly the reverse of that by which the generalizes them. For as in the process of generalization, the abstracts from her ideas of any number of species certain qualities in which they differ from each other, and of the remaining qualities in which they agree, constitutes the first genus in the ascending series; so when she wishes to make her conceptions more particular, she annexes to her idea of any genus those qualities or circumstances which were before abstracted from it; and the genus, with this annexation, constitutes the first species in the descending series. In like manner, when she wishes to descend from any species to an individual, she has only to annex to the idea of the species those particular qualities which discriminate the individual intended from the other individuals of the same kind.\n\nThis particularizing operation of the mind points out the manner of applying the general terms of language for the purpose of expressing particular ideas. For as the mind, to limit a general idea, connects that idea with the idea of some particular circumstance; so language, as we have already observed, in order to limit a general term, connects that term with the word denoting the particular circumstance. Thus, in order to particularize the idea of horse, the mind connects that general idea with the circumstance, suppose, of whiteness; and in order to particularize the word horse, language connects that word with the term white; and so in other instances.—Annexation, therefore, or the connecting of general words or terms in language, fits it for expressing particular conceptions; and this must hold alike good in all languages. But the methods of denoting this annexation are various in various tongues. In English and most modern languages we commonly use for this purpose\n\n(b) It is almost needless to observe, that the words genus and species, and the phrases higher genus and lower species, are taken here in the logical sense; and not as the words genus, species, order, clas, are often employed by naturalists. For a farther account of the mental process of generalization, see Logic and Metaphysics.\nChap. I.\n\nNoun. pofe little words, which we have chosen to style particles; and in the Greek and Latin languages, the cases of nouns answer the same end.\n\n19. Cases, therefore, though they are accidents of nouns not absolutely necessary, have been often considered as such; and they are certainly worthy of our examination, since there is perhaps no language in which some cases are not to be found, as indeed without them or their various powers no language could readily answer the purposes of life.\n\nAll the oblique cases of nouns (if we except the vocative) are merely marks of annexation; but as the connections or relations subsisting among objects are very various, some cases denote one kind of relation, and some another. We shall endeavour to investigate the connection which each case denotes, beginning with the genitive.—This is the most general of all the cases, and gives notice that some connection indeed subsists between two objects, but does not point out the particular kind of connection. That we must infer, not from our nature or termination of the genitive itself, but from our previous knowledge of the objects connected. That the genitive denotes merely relation in general, might be proved by aducing innumerable examples, in which the relations expressed by this case are different; but we shall content ourselves with one observation, from which the truth of our opinion will appear beyond dispute. If an expression be used in which are, connected by the genitive case, two words significant of objects between which a twofold relation may subsist, it will be found impossible, from the expression, to determine which of these two relations is the true one, which must be gathered wholly from the context. Thus, for example, from the phrase injuria regis, no man can know whether the injury mentioned be an injury suffered or an injury inflicted by the king: but if the genitive case notified any particular relation, no such ambiguity could exist. This case therefore gives notice, that two objects are, somehow or other (c), connected, but it marks not the particular sort of connection. Hence it may be translated by our particle of, which will be seen afterwards to be of a signification equally general.\n\nThe dative and accussive cases appear to have nearly the same meaning: each of them denoting apposition, or the junction of one object with another. Thus when any one says, Comparo Virgilium Homero, Homer and Virgil are conceived to be placed beside one another, in order to their being compared; and this sort of connection is denoted by the dative case. In like manner, when it is said latus humeros, breadth is conceived as joined to or connected in apposition with shoulders; and the expression may be translated \"broad at the shoulders.\"\n\nThis apposition of two objects may happen either without previous motion, or in consequence of it. In the foregoing instances no motion is presupposed; but if one say, Misit aliquos subfadio eorum, the apposition is there in consequence of motion. In like manner, when it is said, Praefatus est Romam, his apposition with Rome is conceived as the effect of his motion thither.\n\nFrom this idea of the accusative, the reason is obvious why the object after the active verb is often put in that case; it is because the action is supposed to proceed from the agent to the patient. But the same thing happens with respect to the dative case, and for the same reason. Thus, Antonius legit Ciceronem, and Antonius nocuit Ciceronem, are expressions of the same import, and in each the action of hurting is conceived as proceeding from Antony to Cicero; which is finely illustrated by the passive form of such expressions, where the procedure above mentioned is expressly marked by the preposition ab: Cicero nocetur, Cicero luditur ab Antonio. It is therefore not true, that \"the accusative is that case, at least the only case, which to an efficient nominative and a verb of action subjoins either the effect or the passive subject; nor is the dative the only case which is formed to express relations tending to itself.\" The only thing essential to these two cases is to denote the apposition or junction of one object with another; and this they do nearly, if not altogether, in the same manner, although from the custom of language they may not be indifferently subjoined to the same verb.\n\nThe Greek language has no ablative case: but in the Latin, where it is used, it denotes concomitancy, or that one thing accompanies another. From this concomitancy we sometimes draw an inference, and sometimes not. For example, when it is said, Templum clamore petebant, clamour is represented as concomitant with their going to the temple; and here no inference is drawn: but from the phrase palloeo metu, although nothing more is expressed than that paleness is a concomitant of the fear, yet we instantly infer that it is also the effect of it. In most instances where the ablative is used, an inference is drawn, of which the foundation is some natural connection observed to subsist between the objects thus connected in language. When this inference is not meant to be drawn, the preposition is commonly added; as, interfectus est cum gladio, \"he was slain with a sword about him;\" interfectus est gladio, \"he was slain with a sword as the instrument of his death.\"\n\nThe remaining cases, which have not been noticed, are the nominative and the vocative. These are in most instances alike in termination, which makes it probable that they were originally one and the same case. The foundation of this conjecture will appear from considering the use to which each of these cases is applied. The nominative is employed to call up the idea of any object in the mind of the hearer. But when a man hears his own name mentioned, his attention is instantly roused, and he is naturally led to listen to what is to be said. Hence, when a man meant particularly to solicit one's attention, he would naturally pronounce that person's name; and thus the nominative case would pass into a vocative, of which the use is always to solicit attention (D).\n\n(c) The Greek grammarians seem to have been aware of the nature of this case when they called it ἀποστολή γνώμης, or the general case: of which name the Latin grammarians evidently mistook the meaning when they translated it caecus genitivus, or the generative case; a name totally foreign from its nature.\n\n(D) The chief objection to this conjecture, that the nominative and vocative were originally the same case, is taken from the Latin tongue, in which the nouns of the second declension ending in us terminate their vocatives.\n20. The Greek and Latin among the ancient, and the German among the modern languages, express different connections or relations of one thing with another by cases. In English this is done for the most part by prepositions; but the English, being derived from the same origin as the German, that is, from the Teutonic, has at least one variation of the substantive to answer the same purpose. For instance, the relation of possession, or belonging, is often expressed by a different ending of the substantive, which may be well called a case. This case answers nearly to the genitive case in Latin; but as that is not a denomination significant of the nature of the case in any language, it may perhaps in English be more properly called the possessive case. Thus, God's grace, anciently Godis grace, is the grace belonging to or in the possession of God: and may likewise be expressed by means of the preposition; thus,—the grace of God.\n\nAlthough the word Godis is as evidently an inflexion of the noun God as the word Dei is an inflexion of Deus, there are grammarians who have denied that in English there is any true inflexion of the original noun, and who have said that the noun with the addition of that syllable, which we consider as the sign of a case, ceases to be a noun, and becomes a definitive; a word which with them is devoid of signification. Thus, in the expression Alexander's house, the word Alexander's stands not as a noun, but as an article or definitive, serving to ascertain and point out the individuality of the house. But this is a palpable mistake: the word Alexander's serves not to point out the individuality of the house, but to show to whom the house belongs; and is therefore beyond dispute, not an article, but a noun in the possessive case. Again, when we say St Peter's at Rome and St Paul's at London, the words St Peter's and St Paul's are neither articles, nor, as has been absurdly imagined, the proper names of edifices, like the Rotundo or the Circus; but they are in the possessive case, the names of the two apostles to whom the churches were dedicated, and to whom they are supposed to belong.\n\nBut that this, which we have called the possessive case, is really not so, must be evident, it is said, because there are certain circumstances in which it cannot be substituted for the noun with the preposition prefixed. Thus, though a man may say, I speak of Alexander, I write of Caesar, I think of Pompey; he cannot say, I speak Alexander's, I write Caesar's, or I think Pompey's. This is indeed true, but it is nothing to the purpose: for though I may say, Loguor de Alexandro, Scribo de Caesare, Cogito de Pompeio; I cannot say, Loguor Alexandri, Scribo Caesarii, or Cogito Pompeii: and therefore all that can be inferred from this argument is, that as the Latin genitive is not always of the same import with the preposition de, so the English possessive is not always of the same import with the preposition of. Upon the whole, then, we may conclude, that English nouns admit of one inflexion; and that though cases are not so essential to nouns as gender and number, no language can be wholly without them or their various powers.\n\nCHAP. II. Of Articles or Definitives.\n\n21. The intention of language is to communicate thought, or to express those ideas which are suggested to us by our senses external and internal. The ideas first suggested to us are those of pain and pleasure, and of the objects with which we are surrounded; and therefore the words first learned must be nouns, or the names of objects natural, artificial, and abstract. Every object about which the human mind can be conversant is strictly and properly speaking particular; for all things in nature differ from one another in numberless respects, which, not to mention the idea of separate existence, so circumstance and individuate them, that no one thing can be said to be another. Now the use of language being to express our ideas or conceptions of these objects, it might naturally be expected that every object should be distinguished by a proper name. This would indeed be agreeable to the truth of things, but we have already seen that it is altogether impracticable. Objects have therefore been classified into genera and species; and names given, not to each individual, but to each genus and species. By this contrivance of language, we are enabled to ascertain in some measure any individual that may occur, and of which we know not the proper name, only by referring it to the genus or species to which it belongs, and calling it by the general or specific name; but as there is frequent occasion to distinguish individuals of the same species from one another, it became necessary to fall upon some expedient to mark this distinction. In many languages general and specific terms are modified and restricted by three orders of words; the article, the adjective, and the oblique cases of nouns. The cases of nouns we have already considered: the adjective will employ our study and attention afterwards: at present our observations are confined to the article; a word so very necessary, that without it or some equivalent invention men could not employ nouns to any of the purposes of life, or indeed communicate their thoughts at all. As the business of articles is to enable us, upon occasion, to employ general terms to denote particular objects, they must be considered, in combination with the general terms, as merely substitutes for proper names. They have, however, been commonly called definitives; because they serve to define and ascertain any particular object, so as to distinguish it from the other objects of the general class to which it belongs, and, of course, to denote its individuality. Of words framed for this purpose, whether they have by grammarians been termed articles or not, we know of no language that is wholly defective. The nature of them may be explained as follows.\n\n22. An object occurs with which, as an individual, we are totally unacquainted; it has a head and limbs, and\nand appears to possess the powers of self-motion and sensation; we therefore refer it to its proper species, and call it a dog, a horse, a lion, or the like. If it belongs to none of the species with which we are acquainted, it cannot be called by any of their names; we then refer it to the genus, and call it an animal.\n\nBut this is not enough. The object at which we are looking, and which we want to distinguish, is not a species or a genus, but an individual. Of what kind? Known or unknown? Seen now for the first time, or seen before and now remembered? This is one of the instances in which we shall discover the use of the two articles A and THE: for, in the case supposed, the article A respects our primary perception, and denotes an individual as unknown; whereas THE respects our secondary perception, and denotes individuals as known. To explain this by an example: I see an object pass by which I never saw till now: What do I say? There goes a beggar with a long beard. The man departs, and returns a week after: What do I then say? There goes the beggar with the long beard. Here the article only is changed, the rest remains unaltered. Yet mark the force of this apparently minute change. The individual once vague is now recognized as something known; and that merely by the efficacy of this latter article, which tacitly intimates a kind of previous acquaintance, by referring a present perception to a like perception already past.\n\nThis is the explanation of the articles A and THE as given by the learned Mr Harris, and thus far what he says on the subject is certainly just; but it is not true that the article THE always intimates a previous acquaintance, or refers a present perception to a like perception already past.—I am in a room crowded with company, of which the greater part is to me totally unknown. I feel it difficult to breathe from the grossness of the inclosed atmosphere; and looking towards the window, I see in it a person whom I never saw before. I instantly send my compliments to the gentleman in the window, and request, that, if it be not inconvenient, he will have the goodness to let into the room a little fresh air. Of this gentleman I have no previous acquaintance; my present perception of him is my primary perception, and yet it would have been extremely improper to send my compliments, &c. to a gentleman in the window.—Again, there would be no impropriety in saying—\"A man whom I saw yesterday exhibiting a show to the rabble, was this morning committed to jail charged with the crime of housebreaking.\" Notwithstanding the authority, therefore, of Mr Harris and his master Apollonius, we may venture to affirm, that it is not essential to the article A to respect a primary perception, or to the article THE to indicate a pre-established acquaintance. Such may indeed be the manner in which these words are most frequently used; but we see that there are instances in which they may be used differently. What then, it may be asked, is the import of each article, and in what respects do they differ?\n\n23. We answer, that the articles A and THE are both of them definitives, as by being prefixed to the names of genera and species they so circumscribe the latitude of those names as to make them for the most part denote individuals. A noun or substantive, without any article to limit it, is taken in its widest sense. Thus, the word man means all mankind;\n\n\"The proper study of mankind is man:\" where mankind and man may change places without making any alteration in the sense. But let either of the articles of which we are treating be prefixed to the word man, and that word is immediately reduced from the name of a whole genus to denote only a single individual; and instead of the noble truth which this line affords, the poet will be made to say, that the proper study of mankind is not the common nature which is diffused through the whole human race, but the manners and caprice of one individual. Thus far therefore the two articles agree; but they differ in this, that though they both limit the specific name to some individual, the article A leaves the individual itself unaffirmed; whereas the article THE affirms the individual also, and can be prefixed to the specific name only. The indefinite article is intended, of which something may finite and be predicated that distinguishes it from the other individuals of the species. Thus, if I say—a man is fit for treasons, my assertion may appear strange and vague; but the sentence is complete, and wants nothing to make it intelligible: but if I say—THE man is fit for treasons, I speak nonsense; for as the article THE shows that I mean some particular man, it will be impossible to discover my meaning till I complete the sentence, and predicate something of the individual intended to distinguish him from other individuals.\n\n\"The man that hath not music in himself, &c.\n\n\"Is fit for treasons.\"\n\nA man, therefore, means some one or other of the human race indefinitely; THE man means, definitely, that particular man who is spoken of; the former is called the indefinite, the latter the definite, article.\n\nThe two articles differ likewise in this respect, that the definite article serves only to separate one individual object from the general class to which it belongs; it cannot be applied to plurals. It has indeed the same signification nearly with the numerical word one; and in French and Italian, the same word that denotes unity is also the article of which we now treat. But the essence of the article THE being to define objects, by pointing them out as those of which something is affirmed or denied which is not affirmed or denied of the other objects of the same class, it is equally applicable to both numbers; for things may be predicated of one set of men, as well as of a single man, which cannot be predicated of other men. The use and import of each article will appear from the following example: \"Man was made for Society, and ought to extend his goodwill to all men; but a man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for the men with whom he has the most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with the man whose temper and disposition suit best with his own.\"\n\nWe have said, that the article A cannot be applied to plurals, because it denotes unity: but to this rule there is apparently a remarkable exception in the use of the adjectives few and many (the latter chiefly with the word great before it), which, though joined with plural substantives, yet admit of the singular article A;\nas, a few men, a great many men. The reason of this is manifest from the effect which the article has in these phrases: it means a small or a great number collectively taken, to which it gives the idea of a whole, that is, of unity. Thus likewise a hundred, a thousand, is one whole number, an aggregate of many collectively taken, and therefore still retains the article. A though joined as an adjective to a plural substantive; as, a hundred years. The exception therefore is only apparent; and we may affirm, that the article a universally denotes unity.\n\n24. The indefinite article is much less useful than the other; and therefore the Greek and Hebrew languages have it not, though they both have a definite article. In languages of which the nouns, adjectives, and verbs, have inflexion, no mistake can arise from the want of the indefinite article; because it can always be known by the terminations of the noun and the verb, and by the circumstances predicated of the noun, whether a whole species or one individual be intended. But this is not the case in English. In that language, the adjectives having no variation with respect to gender or number, and the tenses of the verbs being for the most part the same in both numbers, it might be often doubtful, had we not the indefinite article, whether the specific name was intended to express the whole species or only one individual. Thus, if we say in English, \"Man was born sent from God,\" we must be understood to mean that the birth of every man is from God, because to the specific term the indefinite article is not prefixed. Yet the words ἐγὼ ἦν ὁ Θεὸς, ἐξελέγχομαι παρὰ τὸν Θεόν convey no such meaning to any person acquainted with the Greek language; as the word ἐξελέγχομαι, without any article, is restricted to an individual by its concord with the verb and the participle; and the sense of the passage is, A man was born (or exiled) sent from God. But though the Greeks have no article correspondent to the article a, yet nothing can be more nearly related than their ὁ to our THE, O βασιλεὺς—THE king; ὁ δώρον—THE gift. In one respect, indeed, the Greek and English articles differ. The former is varied according to the gender and number of the noun with which it is associated, being ὁ—masculine, ἡ—feminine, τό—neuter; and ὅ—αι, τα, in the plural number: whereas the English article suffers no change, being invariably the before nouns of every gender and in both numbers. There are, however, some modern languages which, in imitation of the Greek, admit of a variation of their article which relates to gender; but this cannot be considered as essential to this species of words, and it may be questioned whether it be any improvement to the language. In tongues of which the nouns have no inflexion, it can only serve to perplex and confuse, as it always prefers a particular idea of sex where in many cases it is not necessary.\n\n25. The articles already mentioned are allowed to be strictly and properly used by every grammarian; but there are some words, such as this, that, any, some, all, other, &c., which are generally said to be sometimes articles and sometimes pronouns, according to the different modes of using them. That words should change their nature in this manner, so as to belong sometimes to one part of speech, and sometimes to another, must to every unprejudiced person appear very extraordinary; and if it were a fact, language would be a thing so equivocal, that all inquiries into its nature upon principles of science and reason would be vain. But we cannot perceive any such fluctuation in any word whatever; though we know it to be a general charge brought against words of almost every denomination, of which we have already seen one instance in the possessive case of nouns, and shall now see another in those words which are commonly called pronominal articles.\n\nIf it be true, as we acknowledge it to be, that the genuine PRONOUN always stands by itself, affuming the power of a noun, and supplying its place, then it is certain that the words this, that, any, some, &c. can never be PRONOUNS. We are indeed told, that when we say THIS is virtue, give me THAT, the words this and that are pronouns; but that when we say, THIS HABIT is virtue, THAT MAN defrauded me, then are they articles or definitives. This, however, is evidently a mistake occasioned by overlooking those abbreviations in construction which are frequent in every language, and which, on account of that very frequency, have perhaps escaped the attention of grammarians whose sagacity has been successfully employed on matters less obvious.—When we say THIS is virtue, it is evident that we communicate no intelligence till we add a substantive to the word thus, and declare what is virtue. The word this can therefore in no instance assume the power of a noun, since the noun to which it relates, though for the sake of dispatch it may be omitted in writing or conversation, must always be supplied by the mind of the reader or hearer, to make the sentence intelligible, or this itself of any importance.—\"When we have viewed speech analysed, we may then consider it as compounded. And here, in the first place, we may contemplate that synthesis, which by combining simple terms produces a truth; then by combining two truths produces a third; and thus others and others in continued demonstration, till we are led, as by a road to the regions of science. Now this is that superior and most excellent synthesis which alone applies itself to our intellect or reason, and which to conduct according to rule constitutes the art of logic. After this we may turn to those inferior compositions which are productive of the pathetic,\" &c.—Here, if anywhere, the word this may be thought to stand by itself, and to affume the power of a noun; but let any man complete the construction of each sentence, and he will perceive that this is no more than a definite article. Thus,—\"we may contemplate that synthesis which by combining simple terms produces a truth; then by combining two truths produces a third truth; and thus other truths and other truths in continued demonstration, till we are led, as by a road into the regions of science. Now this combination of truths is that superior and most excellent synthesis which alone applies itself to our intellect or reason, and which to conduct according to rule constitutes the art of logic. After we have contemplated this art, we may turn,\" &c.\n\nThe word that is generally considered as still more equivocal than this; for it is said to be sometimes an article, sometimes a pronoun, and sometimes a conjunction. In the following extract it appears in all these capacities; and yet, upon resolving the passage into parts and completing the construction, it will be found to be invariably a definite article.—\"It is necessary to that perfection,\nfection, of which our present state is capable, that the mind and body should both be kept in action; that neither the faculties of the one nor of the other be suffered to grow lax or torpid for want of use: but neither should health be purchased by voluntary submission to ignorance, nor should knowledge be cultivated at the expense of health; for that must enable it either to give pleasure to its possessor, or affluence to others.\" If this long sentence be resolved into its constituent parts, and the words be supplied which complete the construction, we shall see the import of the word THAT to be precisely the same in each clause. \"The mind and body should both be kept in action; that action is necessary to THAT perfection of which our present state is capable: neither the faculties of the one nor of the other should be suffered to grow lax or torpid for want of use; the degree of action proper to prevent THAT laxness is necessary: but neither should health be purchased by voluntary submission to ignorance, nor should knowledge be cultivated at the expense of health; for THAT health must enable it either to give pleasure to its possessor, or affluence to others.\" Again:\n\n\"He that's unskillful will not toss a ball.\"\n\n\"A man unskillful (he is that) will not toss a ball.\" Here the word THAT, though substituted for what is called the relative pronoun (E), still preserves unchanged its definitive import; and in every instance, except where it may be used very improperly, it will be found to be neither more nor less than a definite article.\n\n26. It appears then, that if the essence of an article be to define and ascertain, the words this and that as well as any, some, all, &c., which are commonly called pronominal articles, are much more properly articles than any thing else, and as such should be considered in universal grammar. Thus, when we say, THIS picture I approve, but THAT I dislike; what do we perform by the help of the words THIS and THAT, but bring down the common appellative to denote two individuals; the one as the more near, the other as the more distant? So when we say, SOME men are virtuous, but ALL men are mortal; what is the natural effect of this ALL and SOME, but to define that universality and particularity which would remain indefinite were we to take them away? The same is evident in such sentences as, SOME substances have sensation, OTHERS want it; Choose ANY way of acting, and SOME men will find fault, &c.; for here SOME, OTHER, and ANY, serve all of them to define different parts of a given whole; SOME, to denote any indeterminate part; ANY, to denote an indefinite mode of acting, no matter what; and OTHER, to denote the remaining part, when a part has been assumed already.\n\n27. We have said that the article is a part of speech so very necessary, that without it, or some equivalent invention (F), mankind could not communicate their thoughts; and that of words falling under this description, we know of no language which is wholly destitute. We are aware that these positions may be controverted; and that the Latin may be instanced as a language which, without articles, is not only capable of communicating the ordinary thoughts of the speaker to the mind of the hearer, but which, in the hands of Cicero, Virgil, and Lucretius, was made to serve all the purposes of the most profound philosopher, the most impassioned orator, and the sublimest poet. That the Latin has been made to serve all these purposes cannot be denied, although Lucretius and Cicero both complain, that on the subject of philosophy, where the use of articles is most conspicuous, it is a deficient language. But should we grant what cannot be demanded, that those two great men were unacquainted with the powers of their native tongue, our positions would still remain unshaken; for we deny that the Latin is wholly without articles. It has indeed no word of precisely the same import with our THE or the Greek ὁ; but the place of the indefinite article A might be always supplied, if necessary, with the numerical word unus. It may be so even in English; for we believe there is not a single instance where the words one man, one horse, one virtue, might not be substituted for the words a man, a horse, a virtue, &c., without in the slightest degree altering the sense of the passage where such words occur. This substitution, however, can be but very seldom if ever necessary in the Latin tongue, of which the precision is much greater than that of the English would be without articles; because the oblique cases of the Latin nouns, and the inflexion of its verbs, will almost always enable the reader to determine whether an appellative represents a whole species or a single individual.—The want of the definite article seems to be a greater defect; yet there are few instances in which its place might not be supplied by THIS or by THAT without obscuring the sense; and the Latin tongue is by no means deficient of articles corresponding to these two. Let us substitute the words ONE and THAT for A and THE in some of the foregoing examples, and we shall find, though the sound may be uncouth, the sense will remain. Thus,\n\n\"That man who hath not music in himself, &c.\n\n\"Is fit for treasons,\"\n\nconveys to the mind of the reader the very same sentiment which the poet expresses by the words \"the man that hath not music,\" &c. Again, \"Man was made for society, and ought to extend his good-will to all men; but one man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for those men with whom he has the most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with that man whose temper and disposition suit best with his own.\" Now the words HIC and ILLE being exactly of the same import with the words THIS and THAT; it follows, that wherever the place of the article THE may in English be supplied by THIS or by THAT, it may in Latin be supplied by HIC or by ILLE. This is the case with respect to Nathan's reproof of David, where the definite article is indeed most emphatical. The original words might have been translated into English, \"thou art that man,\" as well as \"thou\n\n(e) See more of this afterwards.\n\n(f) As in the Persian and other eastern languages, in which the place of our indefinite article is supplied by a termination to those nouns which are meant to be particularized.\nart the man;\" and in Latin they may with the utmost propriety be rendered, \"Tu es ille homo.\" Indeed the words HIC and ILLE, and we might instance many more, though they are commonly called pronouns, are in truth nothing but definite articles; HIC is evidently the Hebrew word al, in the plural ale; which may be translated indifferently, either THE or THAT. But what proves beyond dispute that these two words are not pronouns but articles, is, that in no single instance will they be found to stand by themselves and assume the power of nouns. For the sake of dispatch, or to avoid disagreeable repetitions, the noun may indeed be often omitted; but it is always supplied by the reader or hearer, when HIC and ILLE appear in their proper place, and are seen to be invariably definite articles.\n\nWe shall give an example of the use of each word, and dismiss the subject.\n\nIn the first oration against Catiline, Cicero begins with addressing himself in a very impassioned style to the traitor, who was present in the senate-house. He then exclaims pathetically against the manners of the age, and proceeds in these words: Senatus hoc intelligi, confutum videt: hic tamen vestit. Vivit? immo vere etiam in senatum venit: fit publici consilii participes. In this passage HIC cannot be a pronoun; for from the beginning of the oration there occurs not a single noun of which it can possibly supply the place. When the orator uttered it, he was probably pointing with his finger at Catiline, and every eye of his audience would supply the noun in his own mind, as we do when we translate it, \"Yet this traitor lives.\" When Virgil says,\n\nILLE ego, qui quondam gracilis modulatus avena\n\nCarmen,\n\nit is obvious that he means, I am THAT MAN, or THAT POET, who sang, &c.; and though we may translate the words \"I am he who tuned his song,\" &c., yet when we construe the passage, we are under the necessity of supplying either vates or vir, which shows that ILLE is nothing more than a definite article signifying THAT or THE. It appears then, that the Latin tongue is not wholly defective of articles, as few cases can occur where the Greek ἐν and ὁ may not be supplied by the words HIC and ILLE; which have in our opinion been very improperly termed pronouns. If there be any such cases, we can only confess that the Latin language is defective; whereas, had it no articles, it is not easy to conceive how it could answer, to a cultivated people, the ordinary purposes of speech.\n\n28. The articles THIS and THAT, unlike A and THE, are varied according as the noun, with which they are associated, is in the singular or in the plural number. Thus we say—this and that man in the singular, and these and those men in the plural. The Latin articles hic and ille, for such we will call them, are varied like the Greek ἐν, not only with the number, but also with the gender of their nouns. In languages, where the structure of a sentence may be so changed from the order of nature, as it commonly is in Greek and Latin, and where the reader is guided, not by the position but by the terminations of the words, to those which are in concord and those which are not, these variations of the article have their use; but in English they are of no importance. Were it not that the custom of the language—the forma loquendi, as Horace calls it—has determined otherwise, there would be no more impropriety in saying this, or that men, than in saying some men, or the men.\n\n29. As articles are by their nature definitives, it follows of course, that they cannot be united with such words as are in their own nature as definite as they may not be indefinite; nor with such words as, being undefinable, cannot properly be made otherwise; but only with those words which, though indefinite, are yet capable through the article of becoming definite. Hence the reason why it is absurd to say, THE 1, or THE THOU; because nothing, as will be seen afterwards, can make these pronouns more definite than they are of themselves; and the same may be said of proper names. Neither can we say, THE BORRI, because the word Borri is in its own nature perfectly defined. Thus, if it be said—\"I have read both poets\"—this plainly indicates a definite pair, of whom some mention has been made already. On the contrary, if it be said, \"I have read two poets,\" this may mean any pair out of all that ever existed. And hence this numeral being in this sense indefinite (as indeed are all others as well as itself), is forced to assume the article whenever it would become definite. Hence also it is, that as TWO, when taken alone, has reference to some primary and indefinite perception, while the article THE has reference to some perception secondary and definite, it is bad language to say, TWO THE MEN, as this would be blending of incompatibles, that is, it would be representing two men as defined and undefined at the same time. On the contrary, to say BOTH THE MEN, is good language; because the substantive cannot possibly be less apt, by being defined, to coalesce with a numerical adjective which is defined as well as itself. So likewise it is correct to say, THE TWO MEN, THESE TWO MEN, or THOSE TWO MEN; because here the article, being placed at the beginning, extends its power, as well through the numeral adjective as the substantive, and tends equally to define them both.\n\n30. As some of the above words admit of no article, because they are by nature as definite as may be; so there are others which admit it not, because they are not to be defined at all. Of this sort are all interrogatives. If we question about substances, we cannot say, THE WHO IS THIS, BUT WHO IS THIS? And the same as to qualities and both quantities: for we say, without an article, WHAT SORT OF, HOW MANY, HOW GREAT? The reason is, the article THE respects beings of which we can predicate something; but interrogatives respect beings about which we are ignorant, and of which we can therefore predicate nothing; for as to what we know, interrogation is superfluous. In a word, the natural affinities with articles are all those common appellatives which denote the several genera and species of beings: and it may be questioned whether, in strictness of speech, they are ever affixed with any other words.\n\n31. We have said that proper names admit not of the article, being, in their own nature, definite. This is true, whilst each name is confined to one individual; but as different persons often go by the same name, it is necessary to distinguish them from one another, to prevent the ambiguity which this identity of name would otherwise occasion. For this purpose we are obliged\nArticles obliged to have recourse to adjectives or epithets. For example, there were two Grecian chiefs who bore the name of Ajax; and it was not without reason that Menelaus used epithets when his intention was to distinguish the one from the other: \"If both Ajaxes cannot be spared (said he), at least let mighty Telamonian Ajax come.\" But as epithets are diffused through various subjects, in as much as the same adjective may be referred to many substantives, it has been said to be necessary, in order to render both parts of speech equally definite, that the adjective itself assume an article before it, which may indicate a reference to some single person only. It is thus we say—Trypho the Grammarian; Apollodorus the Cyrenian, &c. This is the doctrine of Mr Harris; from which, though we have the highest respect for the learning of the author, we feel ourselves obliged to dissent. In the examples given, the article THE is certainly not associated with the words Grammarian and Cyrenian, in the same manner in which it is associated with the word man in the sentence—\"The man that hath not music in himself,\" &c. When we say Apollodorus the Cyrenian, we may, without folly or impertinence, be asked—the Cyrenian WHAT (g)? And the moment this question is answered, it will be seen that the article defines, not an adjective, but a substantive. If the answer be, the Cyrenian philosopher, the article THE is associated with the word philosopher, and the phrase Apollodorus the Cyrenian, is an abbreviation of Apollodorus the philosopher of Cyrene.\n\nIn like manner, Trypho the grammarian, is Trypho the grammarian writer, or Trypho the writer of grammar. Such abbreviations are very common. We familiarly say THE SPEAKER, and are underfoot to mean a high officer in the British parliament; yet, as speaker is a name common to many men, we may, without impropriety, be asked, what speaker we mean? and if so, we must reply, the speaker of the house of commons. But that which is eminent is supposed to be generally known; and therefore, in common language, THE SPEAKER is deemed a sufficient designation of him who presides over the lower house of parliament. Hence, by an easy transition, the definite article, from denoting reference, comes to denote eminence also: that is to say, from implying an ordinary pre-acquaintance, to presume a kind of general and universal notoriety. Thus A KING is any king; but THE KING is that person whom we acknowledge for our sovereign, the king of Great Britain. In Greek too, as in English, the article is often a mark of eminence; for THE POET meant Homer, and THE STAGYRITE meant Arifotle; not but that there were many poets besides Homer, and many Stagyrites besides Arifotle, but none equally illustrious.\n\n32. Before we dismiss the ARTICLE, we shall produce one example to show the utility of this species of words; which, although they may seem to be of small importance, yet, when properly applied, serve to make a few general terms sufficient for expressing, with accuracy, all the various objects about which mankind can have occasion to converse. Let MAN be the general term, which I have occasion to employ for the purpose of denoting some particular. Let it be required to express this particular as unknown; I say A MAN: Pronouns. Known; I say THE MAN:—Definite; A CERTAIN MAN: Indefinite; ANY MAN:—Present, and near; THIS MAN: Present, and at some distance; THAT MAN:—Like to some other; SUCH A MAN:—Different from some other; ANOTHER MAN:—An indefinite multitude; MANY MEN:—A definite multitude; A THOUSAND MEN:—The ones of a multitude, taken throughout; EVERY MAN:—The same ones taken with distinction; EACH MAN:—Taken in order; FIRST MAN, SECOND MAN, &c.:—The whole multitude of particulars taken collectively; ALL MEN:—The negation of that multitude; NO MAN:—A number of particulars present and near; THESE MEN:—At some distance, or opposed to others; THOSE MEN:—A number of individuals separated from another number; OTHER MEN:—A small indefinite number; FEW MEN:—A proportionally greater number; MORE MEN:—A smaller number; FEWER MEN:—And so on we might go almost to infinitude. But not to dwell longer upon this subject, we shall only remark, \"that minute changes in principles lead to mighty changes in effects; so that principles are well entitled to regard, however trivial they may appear.\"\n\nCHAP. III. Of Pronouns, or Substantives of the second order.\n\n33. To men who are neither intoxicated with their own abilities, nor ambitious of the honour of building new systems, little pleasure can accrue from differing upon points of science from writers of great and deserved reputation. In such circumstances a man of modesty, although he will not upon the authority of a celebrated name adopt an opinion of which he perceives not the truth, must always advance his own notions with some degree of diffidence, as being conscious that the truth which he cannot perceive, may be visible to a keener and more perspicacious eye. In these circumstances we feel ourselves with regard to some of the most celebrated writers on grammar, from whom, concerning one or two points, comparatively indeed of but little importance, we have already been compelled reluctantly to differ. In treating of pronouns we are likely to deviate still farther from the beaten track; but that we may not be accused of acting the part of dogmatists in literature, and of claiming from others that implicit confidence which we refuse to give, we shall state with fairness the commonly received opinions, point out in what respects we think them erroneous, assign our reasons for calling them in question, and leave our readers to judge for themselves. The most celebrated writer in English who has treated of pronouns, and whom, since the publication of his Hermes, most other writers have implicitly followed, is Mr Harris, who, after a short introduction, proceeds thus:\n\n34. \"All conversation passes between individuals who will often happen to be till that instant unequainted, only supposing each other. What then is to be done? How shall the speaker address the other, when he knows not his personal name? or how explain himself by his own name, of pronouns, which the other is wholly ignorant?\" Nouns, as they have...\nhave been described, cannot answer this purpose. The first expedient upon this occasion seems to have been pointing, or indicating by the finger or hand; some traces of which are still to be observed, as a part of that action which naturally attends our speaking. But the authors of language were not content with this: they invented a race of words to supply this pointing; which words, as they always stood for substantives or nouns, were characterized by the name of pronouns. These also they distinguished into three several sorts, calling them pronouns of the first, the second, and the third person, with a view to certain distinctions, which may be explained as follows.\n\n\"Suppose the parties conversing to be wholly unacquainted, neither name nor countenance on either side known, and the subject of the conversation to be the speaker himself. Here to supply the place of pointing, by a word of equal power, the inventors of language furnished the speaker with the pronoun I; I write, I say, I desire, &c.; and as the speaker is always principal with respect to his own discourse, this they called, for that reason, the pronoun of the first person.\n\n\"Again, suppose the subject of the conversation to be the party addressed. Here, for similar reasons, they invented the pronoun thou; thou write, thou walk, &c.; and as the party addressed is next in dignity to the speaker, or at least comes next with reference to the discourse, this pronoun they therefore called the pronoun of the second person.\n\n\"Lastly, suppose the subject of conversation neither the speaker nor the party addressed, but some third object different from both. Here they provided another pronoun, he, she, or it; which, in distinction to the two former, was called the pronoun of the third person: And thus it was that pronouns came to be distinguished by their respective persons.\"\n\n36. The description of the different persons here given is taken, we are told, from Priscian, who took it from Apollonius. But whatever be the deference due to these ancient masters, their learned pupil, though guided by them, seems not to have hit upon the true and distinguishing characteristic of the personal pronouns. He supposes, that when the names of two persons conversing together are known to each other, they may, by the use of these names, express all that the personal pronouns express: but this is certainly not true. To us, at least, there appears to be a very material difference between saying, \"George did this,\" and \"I did this;\" nor do we think that the power of the pronoun would be completely supplied by the name, even with the additional aid of indication by the hand. So when one man says to another, with whom he is conversing, \"James did so and so,\" it is surely not equivalent to his saying, \"you did so and so.\" If such were the case, one might pertinently ask, when both persons are known to each other, Why do they use the personal pronouns? Mr Harris tells us, that \"when the subject of conversation is the speaker himself, he uses I; and when it is the party addressed, he uses thou.\" But in fact the nature of the personal pronouns has no sort of connection with the subject of conversation, whether that conversation relate to the speaker, the party addressed, or a Greek book. In this sentence, \"I say that the three angles of every triangle are equal to two right angles,\" the speaker is surely not the subject of the discourse; nor is the party addressed, but the truth of his assertion, the subject of discourse in the following sentence;—\"You say, that Horne Tooke's Diversion of Purley is the most matterly treatise on grammar, so far as it goes, that you have ever seen.\" Mr Harris uses the phrase, becoming the subject of conversation, in no other sense than that when the speaker has occasion to mention himself, he uses I; when the party addressed, thou; and when some other person or thing, he, she, or it: but we know that he may use other words, by no means equivalent to the two first of these pronouns, which will sufficiently mark himself, and the party addressed; and that he may use indifferently, and without the smallest injury to the sense, either the third pronoun, or the word for which it is merely a substitute. A man who bears various characters, may dignify himself by any one of them. Thus Mr Pitt may speak of himself as first lord of the treasury, chancellor of the exchequer, or member for the university of Cambridge; and in each case he would be what Mr Harris calls the subject of conversation: yet every one feels that none of these designations is equivalent to I. What then is the force of the personal pronouns?\n\n37. It appears to be simply this: The first denotes the real speaker, as characterized by the present act of import of speaking, in contradiction to every other character which he may bear. The second denotes the party addressed, as characterized by the present circumstance of being addressed, in contradiction to every other character, &c.: And what is called the pronoun of the third person is merely a negation of the other two, as the neuter gender is a negation of the masculine and feminine. If this account of the personal pronouns be true, and we flatter ourselves that its truth will be obvious to everybody, there is but one way of expressing by other words the force of the pronouns of the first and second person. Thus, \"The person who now speaks to you did so and so,\" is equivalent to \"I did so and so;\" and \"The person to whom I now address myself did so and so,\" is equivalent to \"You did so and so.\"\n\nHence we see why it is improper to say I or the thou; for each of these pronouns has itself the force of a noun with the definite article prefixed, and denotes a person of whom something is predicated, which distinguishes him from all other persons. I is the person who now speaks, thou is the person who is now addressed by the speaker. Hence too we see the reason why the pronoun I is said to be of the first, and the pronoun thou of the second person. These pronouns can have place only in conversation, or when a man, in the character of a public speaker, addresses himself to an audience; but it is obvious, that there must be a speaker before there can be a hearer; and therefore, that the pronouns may follow the order of nature, I, which denotes the person of the speaker, must take place of thou, which denotes the person of the hearer. Now the speaker and the hearer being the only persons engaged in conversation or declamation, I is with great propriety called the pronoun of the first, and thou the pronoun of the second person. We have said, that, with respect to pronouns, the third person, as it is called, is merely a negation of the other two. This is evident from the slightest attention to the import of those words which are called pronouns of the third person. He, she, or it, denotes not the person either of the speaker or of the hearer; and\nPronouns, and, as we have just observed, no other person can have a share in conversation or declamation. An absent person or an absent thing may be the subject of conversation, but cannot be the speaker or the person addressed. He, she, and it, however, as they stand by themselves, and assume the power of nouns, are very properly denominated pronouns; but they are not personal pronouns in any other sense than as the negation of sex is the neuter gender.\n\n38. We have already seen that nouns admit of number; pronouns, which are their substitutes, likewise admit of number. There may be many speakers at once of the same sentiment, as well as one, who, including himself, speaks the sentiment of many; speech may likewise be addressed to many at a time, as well as to one; and the subject of the discourse may likewise be many. The pronoun, therefore, of every one of the persons must admit of number to express this singularity or plurality. Hence the pronoun of the first person I, has the plural we; that of the second person thou, has the plural ye or you; and that of the third person he, she, or it, has the plural they, which is equally applied to all the three genders.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans, when addressing one person, used the pronoun in the singular number thou; whereas, in the polite and even in the familiar style, we, and many other modern nations, use the plural you. Although in this case we apply you to a single person, yet the verb must agree with it in the plural number; it must necessarily be, you have, not you hath. You was—the second person plural of the pronoun placed in agreement with the first or third person singular of the verb, is an enormous, though common, solecism, which ought to be carefully avoided. In very solemn style, as when we address the Supreme Being, we use thou—perhaps to indicate that he is God alone, and that there is none like unto him; and we sometimes use the same form of the pronoun in contemptuous or very familiar language, to intimate that the person to whom we speak is the meanest of human beings, or the dearest and most familiar of our friends. A king, exerting his authority on a solemn occasion, adopts the plural of the first person, \"we strictly command and charge;\" meaning, that he acts by the advice of counsellors, or rather as the representative of a whole people. But in all cases in which the use of the pronoun deviates from the nature of things, the verb in concord deviates with it; for, as will be seen afterwards, these two words universally agree in number and person.\n\n39. But though all these pronouns have number, neither in Greek, Latin, or any modern language, do those of the first and second person carry the distinctions of sex. The reason is obvious (H), namely, that sex and all other properties and attributes whatever, except pronouns, those mentioned above as descriptive of the nature of these pronouns, are foreign from the intention of the speaker, who, when he uses the pronoun I, means the person who now speaks—no matter whether man or woman; and when the pronoun thou—the person—no matter whether man or woman—to whom he now addresses himself—and nothing more. In this respect, the pronoun of the third person denoting neither object of the speaker nor the hearer, but the subject of the different pronoun of the third course, and being merely the substitute of a noun which person may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter, must of necessity agree with the noun which it represents, and the first and second admit of a triple distinction significant of gender. In English, which allows its adjectives no genders, this pronoun is he in the masculine, she in the feminine, and it in the neuter; the utility of which distinction may be better found in supposing it away. Suppose, for example, that we should in history read these words: He caused him to destroy him—and were informed that the pronoun, which is here thrice repeated, stood each time for something different; that is to say, for a man, for a woman, and for a city, whose names were Alexander, Thais, and Persepolis. Taking the pronoun in this manner—divested of its gender—how would it appear which was destroyed, which the destroyer, and which the cause that moved to the destruction? But there is no ambiguity when we hear the genders distinguished; when we are told, with the proper distinctions, that she caused him to destroy it, we know with certainty, that the prompter was the woman; that her instrument was the hero; and that the subject of their cruelty was the unfortunate city.—From this example we would be surprised how the Italians, French, and Spaniards, could express themselves with precision or elegance with no more than two variations of this pronoun.\n\n40. Although in every language with which we are acquainted, there is but but one pronoun for each of the first and second persons; and although it is obvious from the nature and import of those words, that no more can be necessary; yet the mere English reader may perhaps be puzzled with finding three distinct words applied to each; I, mine, and me, for the first person; thou, thine, and thee, for the second. The learned reader will see at once that the words mine and me, thine and thee, are equivalent to the genitive and accusative cases of the Latin pronouns of the first and second persons. That mine is a pronoun in the possessive case, is obvious; for if I were asked \"whole book is that before me?\" I should reply—\"It is mine (i);” meaning that it belongs to me.\n\nThat\nThat the word *me* is the same pronoun in the case which the Latin grammarians call the *accusative*, is evident from the import of that word in the sentence *HE ADMIRIES ME*, where the admiration is supposed to proceed from (k) the person spoken of to the person who speaks. It appears therefore, that though English nouns have only two cases, the nominative and possessive, the pronouns of that language have three, as *I, mine, me; thou, thine, thee; he, his, him,* &c.\n\nThat these are cases, can be questioned by no man who admits that *mei, mihi, me*, are cases of the Latin pronoun *ego*. Both pronouns, the Latin and the English, are irregularly inflected: and perhaps those words which are called the oblique cases of each may have originally been derived from nominatives different from *ego* and *I*; but these nominatives are now lost, and *mei* and *mine* have, beyond all dispute, the effect of the genitives of the Latin and English pronouns of the first person. These variations, however, cannot be looked upon as an essential part of language, but only as a particular refinement invented to prevent the disagreeable repetition of the pronoun, which must frequently have happened without such a contrivance. This seems to have been the only reason why pronouns have been endowed with a greater variety of cases than nouns. Nouns are in themselves greatly diversified: every genus and every species of objects has a distinct name, and therefore the sameness of sound does not so often occur among them as it would among the pronouns, without cases, where the same *I, thou, he, she*, or *it*, answers for every object which occurs in nature: but by this diversity in the form of the words, the cacophonia, which would be otherwise disagreeing, is in a great measure avoided. It is, probably, for the same reason, that the plural of each of these pronouns is so very different from the singular. Thus from *I, mine, me*, in the singular, is formed, in the plural, *we, ours, us*: from *thou, thine, and thee, ye or you, yours*: and from *he, she, it, his, hers, its, him, her, it*, in the singular, *they, theirs, them*, in the plural. In all of which there is not the least resemblance between the singular and plural of any one word: and except in *he, his, him; it, its; they, theirs, them*; there is not any similarity between the different cases of the same word in the same number.\n\n41. From the account here given of the personal pronouns, it appears that the first or second will, either of them, coalesce with the third, but not with each other. For example, it is good sense, as well as good grammar, to say in any language, *I AM HE—THOU ART HE—WE WERE THEY—YOU WERE THEY*; but we cannot say—I AM THOU—nor THOU ART I—nor WE ARE YOU, &c. The reason is, there is no absurdity for the speaker to be the subject also of the discourse, as when it is said—I am he; or for the person addressed, as when we say, thou art he. But for the same person, in the same circumstances, to be at once the speaker and the party addressed, is impossible; for which reason the coalescence of the pronouns of the first and second persons is likewise impossible.\n\n42. *I, thou, he, she*, and *it*, are all that are usually called personal pronouns. There is another class of personal adjectives, which are called sometimes pronominal adjectives, sometimes adjective pronouns, sometimes possessive pronouns; and by one writer of grammar they have been most absurdly termed pronominal articles. It is not worth while to dispute about a name; but the words in question are *my, thy, her, our, your, their*. These words are evidently in the form of adjectives: for, like other English adjectives, they have no variation to indicate either gender, number, or case; and yet they are put in concord with nouns of every gender and both numbers, as *my wife, my son, my book—her husband, her sons, her daughters*, &c. But, though in the form of adjectives, they have the power of the personal pronouns in the possessive case: *my book* is the book of *me*, or the book of *him who now speaks*; *our house* is the house of *us*, or the house occupied by the persons who now speak; *her husband*, is the husband of a woman who can be known only from something preceding in the discourse; and their property is the property of them—of any persons, whether men or women, or both, who have been previously mentioned. Words which have the form of adjectives, with the power of pronouns, may, without impropriety, be called pronominal adjectives; and such is the name by which we shall henceforth distinguish them. To these pronominal adjectives as well as to the personal pronouns, are subjoined the words *own* and *self—in the plural *selves*: in which case they are emphatic, and imply a silent contrariety or opposition. Thus, *I live in my own house*; that is, *not in a hired house*. *This I did with my own hand*; that is, *not by proxy*. *This was done by myself*; that is, *not by another*. The word *self* subjoined to a personal pronoun forms also the reciprocal pronoun; as we hurt ourselves, *pro se* by vain rage; he blamed himself for his misfortune. *Himself, itself, themselves*, are supposed by Wallis to be put, by corruption, for *his self, its self, their selves*; so that *self* is always a substantive or noun, and not a pronoun. This seems to be a just observation; for we say, *the man came himself*; they went *themselves*; where the words *himself* and *themselves* cannot be accusatives but nominatives, and were anciently written *his self, their selves*.\n\nThere are other words which are usually ranked under the class of pronouns; as *who, which, what*. These, when employed in asking questions, are called interrogative pronouns; though a name more characteristic might surely be found for them. Their import, however, will be more easily ascertained after we have considered another species of pronouns, which have been denominated relatives, and with which they are intimately connected.\n\n43. The pronouns already mentioned may be called the relative pronouns, as may indeed all substantives, because they are capable of introducing or leading a sentence; but\n\n(k) See Chap. I. 18, 19, on the Cases of Nouns.\nbut there is another pronoun which has a character peculiar to itself; and which, as it is never employed but to connect sentences, and must therefore have always a reference to something preceding, is called the subjunctive or relative pronoun. This pronoun is in Greek, ὅτι, ὅτε; in Latin, QUI, QUAE, QUOD; and in English, WHO, WHICH, WHAT.\n\n44. In order to determine with precision the nature and import of the relative pronoun, it will be necessary to ascertain the powers which it contains, or the parts of speech into which it is capable of being resolved. Now, it is obvious, that there is not a single noun, or prepositional pronoun, which the relative is not capable of representing; for we say, I, who saw him yesterday cannot be mistaken; they, who did not see him, may have been misinformed; they, who neither saw nor heard, can know nothing of the matter; the things, which were exhibited, were wonderful. From these examples it is apparent, in the first place, that the relative contains in itself the force of any other pronoun; but it contains something more.\n\n45. If from any sentence in which there is a relative, that relative be taken away, and the prepositional pronoun, which it represents, be substituted in its stead, the sentence will lose its bond of union, and stand quite loose and unconnected. Thus, if instead of saying the man is wise who speaks little, we should say the man is wise he speaks little, the sentence would be resolved into two; and what is affirmed of the man's wisdom, would have no connection with the circumstance of his speaking little. Hence it is evident, in the second place, that the relative contains the force of a connective as well as of the prepositional pronoun. What kind of connection it denotes, is next to be ascertained.\n\n46. It may be laid down as a general principle, \"that, by means of the relative pronoun, a clause of a sentence, in which there is a verb, is converted into the nature of an adjective, and made to denote some attribute of a substantive, or some property or circumstance belonging to the antecedent noun.\" Thus, when it is said, homo qui prudentia praeditus est, the relative clause—qui prudentia praeditus est—expresses nothing more than the quality of prudence in concrete with the subject homo, which might have been equally well expressed by the adjective prudent. In like manner, when we say, vir sapiens qui paucia loquitur, the relative clause expresses the property of speaking little as belonging to the man, and as being that quality which constitutes, or from which we infer, his wisdom; but if there were such a word as pauclloquentis, that quality might very properly be expressed by it, and the phrase vir sapiens pauclloquentis would express the same affection with vir sapiens qui paucia loquitur.\n\nNow if a relative clause expresses that which might be expressed by an adjective, the presumption is, that it may be resolved into the same constituent parts. But every adjective contains the powers of an abstract substantive, together with an expression of connection; and may be resolved into the genitive case of that substantive, or into the nominative with the particle of preposition, which, in English, corresponds to the termination of the genitive in the ancient languages. That the English member of a sentence, in which there is a relative, preposition may, in every instance, be analysed in the same manner, will be apparent from the following examples. Vir qui sapit, vir sapiens, and vir sapientiae; \"a man who is wise, a wise man, and a man of wisdom;\" are certainly phrases of the same import. Again, homo cui ingratus est animus, malus fit amicus, may be translated into Greek, ἀδέκατος ἀξιώσις ἄνωθεν, γινόμενος φίλος; and into English, \"the man of ingratitude is a bad friend.\"\n\n47. Thus then it appears, that the relative pronoun contains in itself the force of the prepositional pronoun, together with that connection implied in English by the preposition of, and in the ancient languages by the genitive case. When one says vir sapiens qui paucia loquitur, the relative clause qui paucia loquitur expresses that attribute of the man from which his wisdom is inferred: it is conceived by the mind, as stript of its propositional form, and standing in the place of a substantive noun governed in the genitive case by vir. The whole sentence might be thus translated, \"the man of little speaking is wise?\" or, did the use of the English language admit of it, \"the man of he speaks little is wise?\" In like manner, when it is said, \"Man who is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble?\"—the relative clause is equivalent to an abstract noun in the genitive case, and the whole might be expressed in the following manner, \"man of he is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.\"\n\nWe are sensible, that these expressions into which, in the instances adduced, we have resolved the relative clauses, will appear extremely uncouth and offensive; but we mean not to recommend them as common modes of phraseology. Against their being employed as such, present use loudly remonstrates (1). They are introduced only with a view to show the true import of the relative\n\n---\n\n(1) It is worthy of observation, however, that, repugnant as such expressions are to the present idiom of the English language, there is nothing in the nature of the thing that could render the use of them improper. All prepositions, as will be seen afterwards, are expressive of relations subsisting between those objects of which they connect the signs in discourse. Those objects may be denoted, either by single words, and then the preposition will govern a noun; or by affections, and then it will govern a nominative and a verb. Thus, when it is said, \"I came after his departure;\" the preposition after expresses the relation between two events—my coming and his departure, and governs a substantive noun: but if it be said, \"I came after he departed,\" the preposition in this case (for, as shall be shown afterwards, it is absurd to call it, in the one instance, a preposition, and in the other a conjunction) expresses the same relation as before, but governs a nominative and a verb.\n\nThis last expression is exactly similar to those employed above. When one says, for example, \"the man of he speaks little is wise;\"—however uncouth the expression may appear from its not being supported by the authority of custom, the preposition of is used precisely in the same manner, and serves the very same purpose, as when it is said, \"the man of little speaking is wise.\" In both cases it denotes the relation between the two objects.\nPronouns, relative pronoun; and for that purpose they are well adapted. That pronoun seems to be of use only when there is a deficiency of adjectives or substantives to denote some complex attribute by which we want to limit a general term or expression. Where such adjectives or substantives exist in language, we may indeed use the relative or not at pleasure. Thus we may say, homo qui grandia loquitur, or homo grandiloquus; because the adjective and the relative clause are precisely of the same meaning. But if the Latins were called upon to translate ἀνθρώποις αὐδεῖας ἀκούσαις, we believe they must have made use of the relative pronoun, as we know not any correspondent adjective in their language.\n\n48. The learned and ingenious Mr Harris has, in his Treatise on Universal Grammar, given an analysis of the relative pronoun very different from that which has been given by us. The result of his inquiry is, that the relative is equivalent to another pronoun, together with an expression of connection of that kind which is denoted by the particle and. This analysis he exemplifies, and endeavours to confirm by the following sentence: \"Light is a body which moves with great celerity.\" Now, says he, instead of which substitute the words and it, and in their united powers you see the force and character of the pronoun here treated. But let any one attentively consider these two expressions—“Light is a body which moves with great celerity,” and “Light is a body and it moves with great celerity,” and he will find that they are not precisely equivalent. For to speak in the language of logic, there is in the first but one proposition, of which the subject is light, and the predicate a complex term expressed by the words—body which moves with great celerity. In the second there are two propositions, or two predications concerning light—first, that it is a body; and secondly, that it moves with great celerity. The relative clause, in the first case, expresses a property of the antecedent body, which with that property is predicated of the subject light; in the second case, this property is removed from the predicate of which it was an essential part, and is improperly converted into a new predication of the subject. The sentence may be resolved upon our Pronouns principles, and its precise import preserved; as—\"Light is a body of it moves with great celerity,\" the clause—\"it moves with great celerity,\" is conceived by the mind as having the force of an abstract substantive, and is connected with the antecedent body by the preposition of, answering to the termination of the genitive case. This abstract substantive thus connected expresses a quality of the body light. But by this example Mr Harris's doctrine is not exhibited in all its absurdity: let us try it by another.\n\nSuppose the following assertion to be true; \"Charles XII. was the only monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends.\" Here it is evident there is but one proposition, of which the predicate is expressed by the words—\"only monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends;\" so that the relative clause is a necessary part of the predicate, and has, like an abstract noun in the genitive case, the effect of modifying the general term monarch. Resolve this sentence on Mr Harris's principles, and you have two propositions of which the first is a notorious falsehood:—\"Charles XII. was the only monarch; and he conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends.\" But instead of and substitute of saying, \"Charles XII. was the only monarch of he conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends,\" and you preserve the true import of the expression (M).\n\n49. Are there no cases, then, in which the relative may be resolved into the connective and with a prepositional pronoun? Undoubtedly there are, and we shall now endeavour to ascertain them.\n\nAdjectives in language have two different effects upon the substantives to which they belong, according to the nature of the attribute which they express. If cases Mr Harris's all the species of which the substantive is the specific name, it is plain that the adjective does not modify or may be limit the substantive, for this obvious reason, that nothing can modify which is not discriminative. Thus,\n\nobjects—man and little speaking; only in the one it is prefixed to a noun, in the other to an afflatory clause of a sentence, the import of which is to be taken as a noun. Custom hath indeed determined that prepositions shall more frequently govern a noun than a nominative and a verb; but they are, in their own nature, equally well adapted to answer both purposes.\n\nBut, as the pronoun of the third person is merely the substitute of some noun, an objector may ask, What noun is here represented by he? \"The man of he speaks little is wife!\" Who is meant by the pronoun he? We answer, the man who is declared to be wife. The objection proceeds from inattention to the radical signification of the word of, which a late ingenious writer has shown to be the fragment of a Gothic or Anglo-Saxon word, signifying consequence or offspring. If this be admitted, and, after the proofs which he has given, we think it cannot be denied, the unctuous phrase, \"The man of he speaks little is wife,\" may be thus refuted, \"The man, a consequence (of his mind is) he speaks little, is wife;\" or, in other words, \"The man, in consequence of his speaking little, is wife.\" The same acute writer, Mr Horne Tooke, has shown that of and for, though of different radical meanings, may often be substituted the one for the other without injury to the sense. Let this substitution be made in the present instance, and the propriety of the phrase will be apparent: \"The man is wife for he speaks little.\" It must be remembered, however, that such a substitution cannot be made in every instance, because for signifies cause, and of signifies consequence.\n\n(M) Mr Harris was probably led into his opinion, from considering the Latin qui or quis as compounded of que and is (see Hermes, page 81, 82 edit. 3d.) But the notion of Perizotius is perhaps better founded, who in his notes ad Sanct. Minerv. considers it as immediately taken from the Greek τις, which in the Doric mode κις, and in the Latin quis. For it seems highly probable, as some ingenious writers have endeavoured to show, that the Latin is a dialect of the Greek. Of this at least we are certain, that many words in the former are immediately adopted from the latter.\nWhen Horace says, \"Prata canis albicant pruinis,\" the adjective *canis* denotes a quality common to all hearthogs; and therefore cannot modify the substantive, because it adds nothing to the conception of which that substantive is the name. But when the attribute expressed by the adjective is competent to some individuals only of the species of which the substantive is the name, the adjective has then the effect of modifying or limiting the substantive. Thus, when one says *vir bonus*, he makes use of an adjective which modifies the substantive *vir*, because it expresses a quality or attribute which does not belong to all men.\n\nThe clause of a sentence, in which there is a relative, as it is in every other respect, so is it in this, equivalent to an adjective; it either modifies, or does not modify, the antecedent, according as the attribute which it expresses is or is not characteristic of the species to which the antecedent belongs. Thus, when it is said, \"Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble,\" the relative clause—who is born of a woman—expresses an attribute common to all men, and therefore cannot modify. In like manner when we say—\"Socrates, who taught moral philosophy, was virtuous?\"—the clause, who taught moral philosophy, does not modify. In both these instances the relative clause might be omitted; and it might be said with equal truth, \"Man is of few days and full of trouble;\"—and \"Socrates was virtuous.\"\n\nBut if it be said, *vir sapi qui paucia loquitur*, the relative clause—*qui paucia loquitur*, modifies the antecedent *vir*; for it is not affirmed of every man, that he is wise, but only of such men as speak little. So—\"Charles XII. was the only monarch who conquered kingdoms to below then on his friends;\" and, \"the man that endures to the end shall be saved;\" with many more examples that will occur to every reader.\n\nNow it will be found, that it is only when the relative clause expresses such a property or circumstance of the antecedent as does not limit its signification, that the relative pronoun can be resolved into a prepositive pronoun with the conjunction *and*, and that in these cases the relative clause itself is of very little importance. Thus in the assertion,—\"Charles XII. was the only monarch who conquered kingdoms to below them on his friends;\"—where the relative clause is restrictive, the who cannot be resolved into *and* he confidently with truth or common sense. But in the expression, \"Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days and full of trouble,\" the relative who may be so resolved, at least without violating truth;—\"Man is of few days and full of trouble, and he is born of a woman.\" The only difference between the sentence with the relative *who*, and the same sentence thus resolved,—is—that, in the former case, it contains but one predication; in the latter two, and these but loosely connected.\n\nThus then it appears that the general analysis of the relative pronoun is into the particle *of*, and a prepositive pronoun; but that there are also occasions on which it may be resolved into a prepositive pronoun and the particle *and*, without materially altering the sense. Now what is the reason of this distinction?\n\nIf the relative clause be equivalent to an adjective, or to an abstract substantive in the genitive case, it is easy to see that the relative itself may, in every instance, be resolved into another pronoun and the particle *of*; but it will not perhaps be quite so evident how it should in any instance be resolved by *and*. This last analysis has its foundation in the nature of the particles *of* and *and*; or, to speak more properly, in the nature of the attribute which the relative clause expresses. Both the particles of *of* and *and* are used to link or join conceptions together; but with this difference, that *of* has the effect of making the conceptions it connects figure in the mind as one object; whereas the conceptions connected by *and* are still conceived separately as before. To explain ourselves by an example: suppose we take two words, *man* and *virtue*, which denote two distinct ideas or conceptions, and join them together by the particle *of*, saying *man of virtue*; the mind no longer views them separately as significant of two conceptions, but of one. Take the same words, and join them together by the particle *and*, saying *man and virtue*: the conceptions denoted by *man* and *virtue* are still viewed separately as two; notice is only given that they are collaterally connected.\n\nThis being the case, it follows, that when the relative modifies the antecedent, or, in other words, when the relative clause and the antecedent denote but one conception, the relative must then be resolved by *of*, in order to preserve this unity of conception. But when the relative does not modify the antecedent; that is, when its clause does not express any necessary part of a complex conception, then the conceptions or ideas denoted by the relative clause and the antecedent may be viewed separately as two; and therefore the relative may be resolved into the corresponding prepositive pronoun and the particle *and*.\n\nTo state this reasoning in a light somewhat different. As every relative clause, which expresses an attribute that is not applicable to a whole genus or species, must necessarily modify some general term, that is, restrict its signification; and as that general term must belong either to the subject or to the predicate of a proposition; it is evident, that every such relative clause is a necessary part of that subject or predicate in which its antecedent stands. If therefore a relative clause, which modifies, be taken away either from the subject or the predicate of a proposition; or if that connection, in consequence of which it modifies, be dissolved (which is always done when the relative is resolved by *and*); the proposition itself will not hold true. The reason is, that the subject or the predicate becomes then too general: for, in the one case, something is predicated of a whole genus or species, which can be predicated only of some individuals of that genus or species; and in the other, a general predication is made where only a particular one can be applied. Thus, if it be said, \"All men who transgress the laws are deserving of punishment;\" the subject of the proposition is expressed by the words, \"all men who transgress the laws.\" Take the clause of the relative \"who transgresses the laws\"—away, and say, \"all men are deserving of punishment;\" and you have a proposition which is not true, because that is affirmed of the whole species which can be affirmed only of some individuals. Retaining now the clause of the relative, but resolving it by *and*, you have the same proposition as before; and together with it, in this instance, another which is equally false:—\"All men, and they transgress the laws, are deserving of punishment;\" that is, \"all men are deserving of punishment, and all men transgress the laws.\"\nBut when the attribute expressed by the clause of the relative is characteristic of the genus or species of the antecedent, and consequently applicable to every individual which that genus or species comprehends, the relative clause may be entirely omitted without affecting the truth of the proposition, which is already as general as it can be. As in this case the import of the relative clause is not restrictive of the signification of the antecedent, it is of little consequence whether the attribute be represented by the connective part of the relative, as of the antecedent, or be affirmed to belong to the antecedent in a separate assertion. Thus it matters not much, whether we say, \"Man, who is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated;\" that is, according to our analysis,—\"Man of he is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated;\" or, forming the relative clause into a separate assertion, and connecting the two by the particle and, we say, \"Man, and he is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated.\"\n\nIn the one sentence, indeed, the reason is implied why man should not be too much elated, viz. his being subject to death; in the other, no reason is assigned for this; we only affirm that man is subject to death, and likewise that he should not be too much elated: but as both affirmations are equally true and evident, it is of little consequence, in such a case as this, whether the reason upon which either is founded be implied or not.\n\n51. From the whole of this tedious investigation, we flatter ourselves that the following conclusions are deduced and sufficiently established: 1st, That the relative pronoun contains in itself the united powers of a connective and another pronoun. 2dly, That of is the connective of which, together with another pronoun, it contains the powers, as in every possible instance it may be resolved into these constituent parts, and the import of the sentence in which it has place remain unaltered. 3dly, That the relative clause of a sentence has the import of an abstract substantive, in the ancient languages, in the genitive case; in English, with the particle of prefixed. 4thly, That the relative pronoun is of necessary use only where there is a deficiency of adjectives or substantives to denote some complex attribute, by which we want to limit a general term or expression; but that where such adjectives or substantives exist in language, we may use the relative or not at pleasure. And, 5thly, That though, in cases where the relative clause does not limit a general term, the relative pronoun may, without violating truth, be analysed by and; yet such analysis is never proper, as it gives two predicates to the same subject, which, in the original proposition, had but one predicate.\n\n52. If the clause of the relative be equivalent to an adjective, as in every instance it seems to be, it will naturally occur, that in the ancient languages, the relative should agree with its antecedent in gender, number, and case. They do agree for the most part in gender and number; in case they cannot often, because the very intention of introducing a relative into language is to represent the antecedent in a different case. Whenever we have occasion to use a substantive or noun in a clause of a sentence, and afterwards to express by another clause, in which there is a verb, an attribute of Pronouns, the object denoted by that substantive, we then employ the relative pronoun. Now it seldom happens that the two clauses admit of the same regimen; and hence the case of the relative is often necessarily different from that of the antecedent, as the case of each must be accommodated to the clause in which it is found. Thus we cannot say, \"Deus qui colimus bonus est;\" but, \"Deus quem colimus bonus est;\" because the regimen of the verb colo is always the accusative.\n\nThis shows the necessity of introducing a relative in those languages which give inflections to their nouns, relative is more useful Were all the nouns of a language indeclinable, there would be little occasion for a relative; and accordingly in English it is often omitted. Examples are frequent in our best authors. Suffice it to quote the following.\n\n\"For I have busines would employ an age.\"\nJane Shore.\n\n\"I had several men died in my ship of calentures.\"\nSwift.\n\n\"They who affect to guess at the object they cannot see.\"\nBolingbroke.\n\nWe are not ignorant that our most eminent grammarians consider such expressions as chargeable with impropriety; and we are far from recommending them in any dignified or solemn composition. But in the instances adduced there is not the smallest degree of obscurity; at least there is none occasioned by the omission of the relative. The reason seems to be, that the mind can easily, by an effort of its own, make the antecedent unite, first with the one clause, and then with the other. Thus when it is said—\"I have busines would employ an age:\" the mind can, without any difficulty, as the word busines has no inflexions, consider it first as the objective case after have, and then as the nominative to would employ; but this cannot be so easily done in the ancient languages, where the termination of the noun is changed by the variation of its cases.\n\n53. Both in the learned and in the living languages the relative has different forms, corresponding to the different genders of nouns; and by these it gives notice whether it is applied to persons, or to things without life. Thus in the English language we say, The man or the woman who went to Rome; The tree which stands on yonder plain. It admits likewise, when applied to males or females, a variation of cases similar to that of the personal pronouns. Thus we say, The man whose book is now before me; The man or woman whom I saw yesterday; but the neuter admits of no such distinction (N); as we say the tree which I saw, as well as the tree which stands on yonder plain. In modern languages the relative admits not of any distinction to denote number; for we say, The man or the men who came yesterday; The man or the men of whom I speak.\n\n54. In English, the word THAT, which by some has been called a demonstrative pronoun, by others a pronoun—that often supplies the place of the relative, as in the following examples: this pro-\n\n\"He is the same man that I saw yesterday.—He was seen.\"\n\n(N) \"Who's is by some authors made the possessive case of which, and applied to things as well as persons; I think, improperly.\" Lowth.\nPronouns, the ablest prince that ever filled a throne.\" With regard to the principle upon which this acceptation of the word that depends, we offer the following conjecture.\n\nIn English, from the cool and phlegmatic arrangement of the language, occasioned by the want of inflexions and conjugations, the place of every part of a sentence is almost uniformly determined, and very little variety is allowed in the collocation of the words. The adjective is almost always placed in apposition with its substantive, and the nominative with its verb. In consequence of this uniformity in the collocation of the words, the mind acquires a habit of connecting in idea any kind of word with the place in which it is used to stand; and is naturally led to consider every word that stands in such a place as belonging to such a class. Hence it is, we imagine, that the definitive that passes into the nature of the relative pronoun; as in those instances in which it occupies the place of the relative, it was natural to consider it as having the same import. Yet the word that has undoubtedly in itself no more the force of the relative pronoun than the or this, or any other definitive whatever. In such expressions as the foregoing, it is not improbable that originally the clause of the definitive that, which we now call the relative clause, was thrown in as a kind of modifying circumstance in the following manner: \"The book (I read that) is elegant;\" where the speaker, finding the word book too general for his purpose, throws in a clause to qualify and restrict it, or to confine his affirmation to that particular book which he is then reading. We can easily suppose, that through time the definitive that in such an expression might be transferred or removed from its own place to that of the relative: so that the expression would run thus, \"The book that I read is elegant;\" which would be considered as precisely equivalent to \"The book which I read is elegant.\" This opinion is not a little confirmed by a similar use of the article in Greek, which, though undoubtedly a definitive like the English the, is often used instead of the relative pronoun. Numberless examples may be found in Homer and Herodotus, especially in the latter, who seldom uses what is properly called the relative. We shall produce one instance from each.\n\n55. We have said that the interrogative pronouns, as they are called, who, which, what, are intimately connected with relatives; we now affirm, that the two first of these words are nothing but relatives, and that the last contains in itself the united powers of a relative and definitive. With respect to cases, number, and gender, the words who and which, when employed as interrogatives, differ not from the same words when employed as relatives; and we hold it as a maxim, without which science could not be applied to the subject of language, that the same word has always the same radical import in whatever different situations it may be placed. To understand this, it is necessary to observe, that all men have a natural propensity to communicate their thoughts in the fewest words possible; hence it follows, that words are often omitted which are necessary to complete the construction of the sentence; and this nowhere happens more frequently than in the use of who and which. In sentences where these words are confessedly relatives, we often find them without an antecedent; as,\n\n\"Who steals my purse steals trash,\" Shakespeare.\n\n\"Which who would learn, as soon may tell the lands,\" Dryden.\n\n\"Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina,\" Mervi. Virg.\n\n\"That is, 'He who steals my purse, &c.;' 'Which he who would learn, as soon, &c.;' and 'Ille qui Bavium non odit,' &c. Such abbreviations occasion no obscurity, because from previous circumstances the hearer knows the mind of the speaker and the persons to whom he refers. But it is not with respect to the relative and antecedent only that such abbreviations have place: in sentences of a different form, whole clauses are sometimes omitted, while the meaning of the speaker is made sufficiently plain. Thus when King Richard III. having lost his horse in battle, exclaims,\n\n\"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!\n\nthere is no complete thought expressed; but the circumstances in which the king then was, enabled those about him to understand that he wanted a horse. Accordingly Catesby answers him,\n\n\"Withdraw, my lord, I'll help you to a horse.\"\n\nIn like manner, when a person asks a question, his expression is frequently incomplete; but the tone of his voice, or some other circumstance, enables us to ascertain his meaning, and to supply, if we please, the words that are omitted. Thus when it is said, An fecisti? nothing more is expressed than, If you did it (the Latin an being nothing else but the Greek ἢ, ἢ); but some circumstance enables the person who hears it to know that the meaning is, \"Say if you did it.\" Let us apply these observations to the words who and which. If these words be relatives, and if our analysis of the relative be just, it is obvious, that no complete meaning can be contained in the clause, \"Who is your principal friend?\" for that clause contains nothing more than the circumstance of being your principal friend predicated of some unknown person; \"of he is your principal friend.\" That this is indeed the case, every man may be convinced, by asking himself what he merely means by the interrogative who in such a sentence; relative; for he will find it impossible to affix to it any meaning and without supplying an antecedent clause, by which that which is called an interrogative will be immediately converted into the relative pronoun. The custom, however, of language, and the tone of voice with which the relative clause is uttered, intimates, without the help of the antecedent, the wish of the speaker to be informed by the person addressed of the name and designation of his principal friend; and we know that the sentence when completed is, \"Tell me the name and designation of the person who is your principal friend.\" Again, when the prophet says, \"who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah?\" he utters but part of a sentence, which when completed will run thus: \"Describe the person who cometh from Edom (this is that person), with dyed garments from Bozrah.\" He sees a person coming from Edom, of whose name and designation he is ignorant;\nnorant; he calls upon some one for information concerning these particulars; and that there may be no mistake, he describes the unknown person as having dyed garments from Bozrah; but let even that description should not be sufficiently accurate, he throws in the definitive clause, this is that person, pointing at him, we may suppose, with his finger.—Which, used as an interrogative, indicates a wish of knowing a particular person or thing out of more than one mentioned; as, \"Which of the two did it?\" that is, \"Tell me the one of the two which did it?\" for in old English which as a relative is often used, where in modern English we should say who; and that mode of speech is still retained when the antecedent is omitted, and the relative clause employed to indicate such a wish as that before us. What includes in itself the signification of a definitive and a relative pronoun; as, \"from what has gone before, what follows may easily be guessed;\" where the word what is equivalent to that which. When therefore we say, \"What rude fellow is that?\" our meaning is, \"Describe that person who is that rude fellow.\" Upon the whole, then, it is evident, that the words called interrogatives are merely relative pronouns; and that interrogative sentences are relative clauses uttered in such circumstances as to enable the hearer to supply the antecedents necessary to complete the meaning.\n\n56. To conclude: We have seen that substantives are either primary or secondary; or, in other words, nouns or pronouns. Nouns denote substances, and those either natural, artificial, or abstract. They moreover denote things either general, or special, or particular; and a general or specific name is made to denote an individual by means of words called articles or definitives. Pronouns are the substitutes of nouns, and are either prepositive or subjunctive. The prepositive is distinguished into three orders, called the first, the second, and the third person. The subjunctive, otherwise called the relative, includes the powers of all those three, having superadded as of its own the peculiar force of a connective.\n\nCHAP. IV. Of Verbs.\n\n57. The words which we have hitherto considered are commonly called substantives primary or secondary, and definitives; because nouns are significant of substances; pronouns are the substitutes of nouns; and the article serves to ascertain the extent of the noun, and to determine whether on any occasion it be significant of a whole class of substances, or only of one individual. But substances are of importance to mankind only on account of their various qualities or attributes; for their internal texture is a thing of which we are profoundly ignorant, and with which we have no manner of concern. Thus, experience teaches us, that certain vegetables are pleasant to the taste, and wholesome food; whilst others are unpleasant and poisonous. The former kinds are valuable only for their qualities or attributes; and they are the qualities or attributes of the latter that make them worthless or hurtful. A horse is strong, and swift, and docile; and may be trained to carry a man on a journey, or to drag a plough. It is for his strength, swiftness, and docility, that he is the most valuable of all quadrupeds. One man is brave, another learned, and another eloquent; and by positing these different qualities, or attributes, each is fitted for a different station in society. It is plain, therefore, that in contemplating substances, our attention must be chiefly principally bestowed upon their qualities, and that the words called words which serve to denote these qualities must be an essential part of language. Such words are in general called attributives; and are of three sorts, Verbs, Participles, and Adjectives.\n\n58. Of all the constituent parts of speech none has given the grammarians greater trouble than the verb. The vast variety of circumstances which it blends together in one word, throws very considerable difficulties in the way of him who attempts to analyze it and ascertain its nature; at the same time, that by its eminent use in language, it is entitled to all the attention which can be bestowed upon it. To the diffusion of the verb, Mr Harris, whose notions of this as of the other parts of speech have been generally adopted by the subsequent writers on grammar, has dedicated a large proportion of his book, in which he has thrown out many excellent observations, mixed, as it appears to us, with several errors. We have already observed, that no man is ignorant when he uses what is called a verb and when a noun. Every schoolboy knows, that the words is, lovethe, walketh, standeth, in English; and est, amat, amatur, ambulat, stat, in Latin, are verbs: he knows likewise that they are of different kinds; that some of them are said to be active, some passive, and some neuter. But it should seem that the first object of our investigation ought to be the characteristic of the verb, or that which all these words have in common, and which constitutes them verbs, distinguishing them from every other species of words. Now it is obvious to the slightest attention, that every verb, whether active, passive, or neuter, may of the verb be resolved into the substantive verb is, and another attributive: for lovethe is of the same import with is loving; walketh, with is walking; and amat, with amans est. But loving, walking, and amans, are not verbs; whence it follows, that the characteristic of the verb, that which constitutes it what it is, and cannot be expressed by other words, must be that which is signified by the word is; and to us that appears to be neither more nor less than assertion.\n\nAssertion therefore, or predication, is certainly the very essence of the verb, as being that part of its office, and that part only, which cannot be discharged by other kinds of words. Every other circumstance which the verb includes, such as attribute, mode, time, &c. it may be possible to express by adjectives, participles, and adverbs; but without a verb it is impossible to predicate, to affirm or deny, any one thing of any other thing. The office of the verb, then, when stript of all accidental circumstances, seems to be merely this, \"To join together the subject and predicate of a proposition:\" its powers are analogous to those of the sign + in Algebra, which does not affect the separate value of the quantities between which it is placed, but only indicates their union or coexistence. To explain by an example: When we say, Cicero eloquens, Cicero wise; these are imperfect sentences, though they denote a substance and an attribute. The reason is, that they want an assertion, to show that such an attribute pertains to such a substance. But when we infert the word was, we\nwe join the substance and attribute together; we give notice that the wisdom and eloquence are applied to Cicero, and we do nothing more: we neither increase the wisdom nor diminish it, we neither make it real nor imaginary; for it was supposed in all its extent when the words Cicero and wise stood independent of each other. We may indeed use the verb in a form which implies not an affixture only, but likewise an attribute; as when we say George writeth, or George walketh: But as whitenefs or any other particular colour is not of the effence of a horse, an animal which is found of all colours; so in the phrases quoted, the attribute, though implied, is not of the effence of the verb; for it may be equally well expressed by other words: George is writing, and George is walking, are phrases of the very same import with George writeth and George walketh.\n\n59. In resolving every verb, whether active, passive, or neuter, into the substantive-verb is and another attributive, we have the honour to agree with all the grammarians; but to the word is itself the learned author of Hermes has given a meaning which, as a verb, it does not admit. He observes, that before anything can be the subject of a proposition, it must exist: that all existence is either absolute or qualified, mutable or immutable: that the verb is can by itself express absolute existence, but never the qualified, without subjoining the particular form; and that it signifies both mutable and immutable existence, having in these cases different meanings; although the sentences which he gives as examples are evidently constructed in the same manner and consist of the same parts of speech. His examples are:\n\nof absolute existence, B is; of qualified, B is an animal;\nof mutable, This orange is ripe; of immutable, The diagonal of the square is inconceivable with its sides. But if predication be the essence of verb, all this is nothing to the purpose, and part of it is not true. It is not true that the verb is ever varies its signification; for it hath as verb no connection with existence of any kind. All such circumstances are superadded to its verbal nature; or, to speak more accurately, we infer such circumstances from our previous knowledge of the objects concerning which the predication is made. When we say, \"this orange is ripe,\" we do indeed mean, as Mr Harris observes, that it is so now at this present in opposition to past and future time: but it is not the verb is, but the definitive this, which fixes the time of maturity, as well as the place of the orange; for had we said, oranges are ripe, we might have been properly asked, When and where are they ripe? although the same verb is used in both sentences. Even in the sentence \"B is,\" absolute existence (the most simple of all) is inferred, and not expressed by the verb; and the inference is made from this obvious principle, \"That when one utters a mark of predication, we naturally conclude that he means to predicate something of the subject.\" If he adds no specific predication, as B is\n\nROUND, we apply to B the most general that we can; and what other species is so general as existence?\n\nThat the idea of existence, considered as mutable or immutable, is not contained in the verb is itself, but is derived from our knowledge of the objects concerning which the predication is made, appears manifestly from this: That if a person be supposed ignorant of the meaning of the words God and man, whilst he knows that of is; the uttering of the two propositions God is happy, and this man is happy, will give him no notice of existence considered as mutable or immutable, temporary or eternal (o). His conclusion with respect to these modes of existence, if any such conclusion be drawn at all, must be derived entirely from his previous knowledge of the nature of God and the nature of man.\n\nSome of our readers may possibly think this notion of verb too abstract and metaphysical; yet what other circumstance than mere predication is essential to that species of words? We say essential; for we are here inquiring, not what is expressed by each individual verb, but what it is which is equally expressed by all verbs, and which distinguishes them from the other parts of speech. And if it be true, that every thing which the verb implies, predication alone excepted, may be expressed by other parts of speech, and that no other parts of speech can predicate; then we think ourselves warranted to affirm, that simple predication is the essential characteristic of verb, that every word which predicates is a verb, and that nothing is so which does not predicate.\n\nIt must not, however, be concealed, that a doctrine very different from this has been lately maintained by a writer of distinguished abilities. \"We have energy expressed,\" says Dr Gregory (v), \"and of course a verb constituted without affirmation, when we will or command; without command, when we affirm or will; without will, when we command or affirm: yet in all these cases we have equally and indubitably a verb.\"\n\nThat in all these cases we have a verb, is indeed indisputable; but we hold it to be equally indisputable, that in all these cases we have affirmation. The ingenious author has given no direct example of a will or command uttered without affirmation; and a feeling or sentiment which is not uttered has nothing to do with language: but he has given a sentence in which there are three verbs, that in his opinion denote no affirmation, but a very plain supposition. If a supposition can be expressed without affirmation, we shall very readily allow that a will or command may be so expressed likewise. The Doctor's supposition is thus expressed:\n\n\"Had any punishment ever overtaken you for your broken vows; were but one of your teeth growing black, or even were but one of your nails growing less beautiful, I should believe you.\" It is almost superfluous to observe, that to every verb not in the infinitive mode there must be a nominative, and to every active verb an object, whatever be the arrangement of the sentence in which such verbs are found. These\n\n(o) The truth of this observation may be proved by experiment, by uttering to a man of good common sense these two propositions, taking care to express the words God and man in a language which he does not understand. Thus, Deus is happy, and hic homo is happy, uttered to a man totally unacquainted with the Latin tongue, will convey no notice of existence considered as mutable or immutable, &c.\n\n(v) Theory of the Moods of Verbs, published in Vol. II. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\nare truths known to every schoolboy; the reasons of them shall be given afterwards. It is likewise undeniable, that in the sentence before us, the nominative to had is any punishment; to the first were, one of your teeth; and to the second, one of your nails. But the sentence arranged in grammatical order, with the several nominatives before their respective verbs, is evidently elliptical; and the conjunction if must be supplied as well to complete the construction as to make sense of the passage. If any punishment had ever overtaken you; if but one of your teeth were growing black, or even if but one of your nails were growing less beautiful, I should believe you.\" Now it has lately been proved, by such evidence as leaves no room for doubt, that if, though called a conjunction, is in fact a verb in the imperative mode, of the same import with give; so that we may substitute the one for the other without in the smallest degree altering the sense. The sentence will then run thus: \"Give any punishment had ever overtaken you; give but one of your teeth were growing black, &c. I should believe you.\" It is therefore so far from being true, that had and were, when the sentence is completed, express no affirmation; that it is only upon granting the truth of the affirmation which they denote, that the speaker says, \"I should believe you.\" \"Any punishment had ever overtaken you,\" is plainly an affirmation; if, give that affirmation, admit its truth, \"I should believe you.\" But it cannot be supposed that had and were change their significations by a mere change of place, or that by being removed from the middle to the beginning of the clause, they lose their original import, and come to denote something entirely different. Were this the case, every attempt to ascertain and fix the general principles of grammar would be as ridiculous as an attempt to arrest the course of time. For what purpose then, it may be asked, if the verb always denotes affirmation, is it removed from the middle to the beginning of the clause, when supposition is implied as in the present instance? We answer, that supposition is neither more nor less than conditional affirmation; that when such affirmation is completely expressed, the verb is not removed to the beginning of the clause; and that such removal takes place only when the clause is elliptical, being merely an artificial contrivance in language, to show the reader or hearer that some such word, as if, demanding the truth of the affirmation, is omitted for the sake of dispatch. This is evident; for when the word requiring the affirmation to be granted is supplied, the verb must be restored to its place in the middle of the clause. Such abbreviations, and such contrivances to mark them, are frequent in all languages, as will be seen more clearly when we come to treat of modes.\n\nUpon the whole, notwithstanding the deference which we willingly pay to this very masterly writer, we are compelled reluctantly to differ from him, and still to think that simple predication is the essence of the verb.\n\nShould we be required to exemplify our theory by language, and to produce instances of this simplified verb in practice, we might answer, that the not being able to produce such instances would be no good argument against the truth of our principles. It is the nature of language to express many circumstances by the same word, all of which however are not essential to distinguish the species to which that word belongs from the other species of words; and it is the nature of man to infer from discourse many things which are not actually expressed. Perhaps, however, something nearly approaching to an exemplification of our idea of a simple verb will be found in the following proposition:\n\n\"The three angles of every plane triangle are equal to two right angles.\" What other office the verb here performs than simply to join the subject and predicate, it is difficult to perceive. It does not give notice of time; or such notice, if given, is an imposition; for the truth of the proposition is independent on time. Neither ought it to imply existence; for the proposition would be true, were there neither a triangle nor a right angle in nature.\n\nThis idea of verb, when it is well considered, we hope will be found just; but should any of our readers suspect it of novelty, and on that account be disposed to condemn it, we have only to request that he will restrain his censure till he has examined the writings of others, and nicely observed the several postures of his own mind in discourse; for meditation may perhaps show him that our theory is not false, and inquiry will satisfy him that it is not novel (Q).\n\nBut although it is certain that affirment, and af. The great-ferention only, is essential to the verb, yet the greater part of that species of words which grammarians call verbs do not an attribute, or, in the language of logic, they express both the copula and the predicate of a proposition: thus, he liveth, he walketh, he writeth, he walketh, are phrases equivalent in all respects—to—he is living, he is writing, he is walking. Now, of attributes some have their essence in motion, as walking; some in the privation of motion, as resting; and others have nothing to do with either motion or its privation, as white and black. But all motion and all privation of motion imply time as their concomitant; and a substance may have an attribute today which it had not yesterday, and will not have tomorrow. This is self-evident; for a man may be at rest today who yesterday was walking, and tomorrow will be on horseback; and a fleet of paper may have been white yesterday, which today is black.\n\n(Q) \"Besides words, which are names of ideas in the mind, there are a great many others that are made use of, to signify the connection that the mind gives to ideas or propositions one with another. The mind in communicating its thoughts to others, does not only need signs of the ideas it has then before it, but others also to show or intimate some particular action of its own at that time relating to those ideas. This it does several ways; as is and is not are the general marks of the mind affirming or denying.\" Locke on Human Understanding.\n\n\"Verbum est pars orationis variabilis, aliquid de re aliqua dici seu aliquam significans.

See also Dr Beattie's Theory of Language.\nblack, and at some future time will be of a different colour. As, therefore, all motions and their privation imply time; and as a proposition may be true, at one time, which is not true at another; all verbs, as well those which denote both an attribute and an affeotion, as those which denote an affeotion only, come to denote time also: Hence the origin and use of tenses, which are so many different forms assigned to each verb, to show, without altering its principal signification, the various times in which the affeotion expressed by it may be true. Whether these various forms of the verb be essential to language, it is vain to dispute. They have place in every language with which we are acquainted; and as the use of the verb is to affirm one thing of another, it is absolutely necessary that the time, when such or such an affirmation is true, be marked by tense, or some other contrivance. Concerning tenses, therefore, we shall throw together some observations equally applicable to every language, after premising a general remark or two which seem necessary in order to proceed with precision.\n\n61. Time, although its essence consists in succession continued and unbroken, may yet be considered by the mind as divided into an infinite number of parts. There is, however, one grand division which necessarily occurs, and to which the different tenses of verbs are in all languages adapted.—Computing from some portion conceived to be present, all time is either past or to come. Hence the tenses of verbs are threefold; some denoting time present, some time past, and others time future.\n\nAgain, from the very nature of time, it must be obvious, that all its parts are relative; i.e. that no portion of it can be ascertained by any thing inherent in itself; but only by referring it to some other portion, with respect to which it is past, present, or to come. In this respect time is perfectly analogous to space: for as the space in which any object exists, cannot be described but by stating its relation to some other space; so neither can the time of any attribute or action be determined, but by stating its relation to some other time. When, therefore, we would mark the time of any action or event, we must previously fix upon some point to which we may refer it. If this point be known, the time referred to it will be known also; but if the former be not known, neither will the latter.\n\nLastly, in contemplating an action, we may have occasion to consider it as going on, or as finished. This distinction is likewise denoted by the different tenses of verbs. In treating, therefore, of the tenses, there are two things to which attention ought principally to be turned—-the relation which the several tenses have to one another in respect of time; and the notice which they give of an action's being completed or not completed.\n\n62. Having premised these remarks, we proceed now to the tenses themselves; of which Mr Harris has enumerated no fewer than twelve. Of this enumeration we can by no means approve; for, without entering into a minute examination of it, nothing can be more obvious, than that his INCEPTIVE PRESENT—I am going to write—is a FUTURE TENSE; and his COMPLETIVE PRESENT—I have written—a PAST TENSE. But, as was before observed of the classification of words, we cannot help being of opinion, that, to take the tenses as they are commonly received, and endeavour to ascertain their nature and their differences, is a much more useful exercise, as well as more proper for a work of this kind, than to raise, as might easily be done, new and hypothetical theories on the subject.\n\nIt has been already observed, that all the tenses must necessarily mark relative time. In one sense, this is extremely obvious. The present tense is used in contradiction to both the past and future, and marks an attribute or action as existing in neither. The past and the future are in like manner used in contradiction to the present; and mark an attribute or action which exists not now, but which in the one case has existed formerly, in the other will exist at some time coming. But besides this relation of contradiction subsisting among the tenses, there is another of co-existence, as we may call it, to which it is of great consequence to attend—especially in examining the nature of the present.\n\n63. The present tense refers not only to something of the present, which is past or future, but also to something with which the attribute or action of the verb is contemporary. This reference is necessarily implied in its very name; for we cannot say of any thing that it is present, without implying at the same time that there is something else with which it is present. Hence it appears with how little reason Mr Harris and others have given us an aorist of the present, as marking present time indefinitely in contradiction to other presents, which have been called inceptive, extended, and completive presents. For from what has been said it follows, that the present tense is necessarily and from its very nature perfectly indefinite, and can of itself give notice of no precise or determinate portion or point of time whatever. A thing may have been present fifty years ago, may be present now, or at any future period. This tense implies the relation of co-existence between two or more things; but, without some auxiliary circumstance, it cannot in any language mark the particular portion of time in which those things exist. The indefinite nature of this tense is indeed most clearly seen in that use of it in which Mr Harris has styled it the aorist of the present; that is, in cases where it is employed to denote the repetition of an action which the agent is accustomed frequently to perform, or to express propositions of which the truth is evinced by general experience; as in the following examples:\n\n\"Hypocrisy—the only evil that walks\n\"Invincible, except to God alone.\"\n\"Ad penitendum properat qui cito judicat,\" &c.\n\nIn these instances it is plain there is no particular time pointed out: the propositions are true, or apprehended as true, at all times. Although the actions, therefore, of walking and hastening are expressed as present, it is impossible from the expressions to determine any precise point of time when they are present.\n\nBut if the present tense be thus indefinite, how, it may be asked, are we to ascertain the particular time which is intended? We answer, it is to be ascertained, either by stating the action of the verb as existing in some time already known, or by inference. If, for example, we say—\"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth unseen,\"—the proposition is general, and the time of walking undetermined. But if we add—\"both when we wake and when we sleep,\"—the time is by this addition ascertained and specified; for if the time when men wake and sleep be known, the time when these spirits walk the earth is known also.—When no specifying clause is given by which to determine the time of the present tense, it is very commonly determined by inference.\nThus, if one use such an expression as—\"He sleeps while I am speaking to him,\"—the time of his sleeping is ascertained by the subsequent clause of the sentence; but if it be said simply—\"he sleeps\"—without assigning any data from which it may be concluded when his sleeping is present, we very naturally infer that it is at the instant we receive the information of his sleeping. Such inferences as these are common in language. The mind is desirous to obtain complete information on every subject; and therefore frequently supplies to itself what is not expressed in the speech of others.\n\nBoth these ways of ascertaining the precise time of the present tense, are excellently illustrated by the use of the word present as applied to space. Take a familiar example:—\"His brother and he were present when I read the letter.\" It is at first sight evident that this expression is perfectly indefinite. But if it be said—\"His brother and he were present at your house when I read the letter,\"—the place of action is then determined by being referred to a portion of space which is known. If no such reference be made, the person who hears the speech uttered must either remain ignorant of the place intended, or he must ascertain it to himself by inference; and he will probably infer it to be that in which the speaker is at the time of his uttering the indefinite sentence. This leads us to observe, that such inferences are not often made without sufficient foundation. Various circumstances may assist the reader or hearer in making them, and prevent all danger of mistake. He may have the evidence of sense, or of something preceding in the discourse, and a number of other particulars, to justify and warrant his conclusion: Thus, if when sitting by a large fire, one pronounces the words—\"I am too warm;\" those to whom he addresses his speech are authorized to conclude, that he is too warm at the time of speaking, unless he expressly prevent the drawing of that conclusion by adding some such clause as—\"When I wear a great coat.\"\n\nIt is strictly demonstrable, and hath by Mr Harris been in fact demonstrated, that there is no such thing as present time. Yet do we not only conceive time as present and existing, but frequently as extended to a very great degree. We speak not only of the present instant, or the present day, but also of the present year, and even of the present century. This manner of conceiving time is indeed loose and unphilosophical; but it is sufficient for the ordinary purposes of language. To express time as it really is, we ought to say, the passing day, the passing year, and the passing century; but in common discourse we denominate any portion of time present, in which the present now or instant is included, although it is obvious that part of that portion is past, and the remainder of it future. From the very nature of time thus conceived to be present, the tense now under consideration must represent the action of the verb as commenced, and not finished; for as time is in continued succession, and accompanies every action; when any action is not commenced, it exists not in any time, though it may exist hereafter in time which is now future; and when it is finished, it exists no longer in time present, but in time past. Hence the absurdity of introducing into a theory of the tenses an inceptive present and a completive present; for these terms imply each a direct contradiction.\n\n64. After having laid so much of the present tense, we shall have but little to say of the praeter imperfect. It states an action in respect of time as past; and in respect of progress, as unfinished. Legebam—I was reading at some past time, but my reading was then incomplete; I had not finished the book or the letter. We imperf. must here observe, however, as we did with respect to fact, the present tense, that although the praeter imperfect represents the action as past, it does not inform us in what precise portion of past time the unfinished action was going on: this circumstance must either be given in separate words, or be inferred by the hearer. If one say simply—Legebam, the person to whom he addrestes his speech will conclude, that the time of his reading is past with respect to the present time of his speaking. But if he say—Legebam antequam venisti, he expressly states the action of reading as past with respect to the time in which his hearer came to the place where they both are at the time of speaking. The time of the praeter imperfect is always past with respect to the present instant when the imperfect is used, and of this the tense itself gives notice; but it may also be past with respect to some other time, and of this it conveys no information.\n\nIf we join two praeter imperfects together, the expression will state the co-existence of two progressive actions, both of which were going on at a time past in respect of some determinate time given or supposed. \"Cum tu ferrebeas ego legebam;\" \"when you were writing I was reading.\" Hence the praeter imperfect has by some grammarians been called the relative present; a name which, however, is by no means exclusively applicable to this tense. When the praeter imperfect is by the conjunction and joined in the same sentence with a pluperfect, the two tenses express two actions, both prior to the time of speaking; but the one as having continued after the other was finished. Thus, Eneas speaking of the destruction of Troy, says, that after having escaped with his father and followers, he returned to the city in quest of his wife, and went directly to his own house; but there, continues he, \"irruerant Danaei, et tectum omne tenebant;\" \"the Greeks had rushed in;\" that action was over and completed before his arrival; but the act of \"polluting the whole house,\" tenebant, was not over, but still continuing.\n\n65. But it is necessary that the verb denote actions which were complete or perfect in past time, as well as those which were incomplete or imperfect. For this purpose, the Greek and English verbs have an aorist, a praeter perfect, and a pluperfect. Of these the Latin has only the two last. The praeter perfect in that language sustains a twofold character: it performs the office of the Greek and English aorist, as well as of the praeter perfect properly so called; that is, it denotes a finished action at some indefinite past time, as well as at some time which is both past and definite.\n\nIn attempting to analyze the signification of complex terms, by which we here mean words that include in their signification a variety of particulars, it is of great advantage to have these particulars separately expressed by different words in another language. Now the English has resolved the tense, which in the Greek and Latin languages are denominated the aorist and the praeter perfect, by means of what are commonly called auxiliary verbs, expressing the former by the verb did, and the latter by the verb have. In examining therefore...\nThe principal distinction in practice between the aorist and preter-perfect (for the difference seems little in their real import) consists in the time by which the performance of the action admits of being particularly specified. The preter-perfect is always joined with a portion of time which includes the present now or instant; for otherwise it could not signify, as it always does, the present possession of the finishing of an action. But the aorist, which signifies no such possession, is as constantly joined with a portion of past time which excludes the present now or instant. Thus we say, \"I have written a letter this day, this week,\" &c.; but, \"I wrote a letter yesterday, last week,\" &c.; and to interchange these expressions of time in Greek and English, where the aorist and preter-perfect have different forms, would be improper. In Latin, indeed, where they have but one form, the impropriety does not appear.\n\n66. Besides the tenses already examined, which are the pluperfective of past time, in most languages the verb has another tense called the plusquam-perfect, in which, however, no difficulty occurs to detain our attention. What the preter-imperfective is to the present tense, that the plusquam-perfective is to the preter-perfective. The verb had, by which it is resolved in English, being evidently the past time of have, sufficiently explains its meaning and relation to the other tenses: \"I had written a letter,\" is equivalent to the phrase, \"I possessed at some past time, the finished action of writing a letter.\"\n\nIt is justly observed by Dr Beattie, that the imperfect and plusquam-perfective are very useful, and may be the sources of much elegant expression; and that if one were not taught to distinguish, in respect of meaning as well as of form, these tenses from each other, and the präterite from both, one could not pretend to understand, far less to translate, any good classic author.\n\n67. Having considered the tenses which imply present and past time, it now remains that we examine the import of those which are expressive of time future. In Latin and English there are two tenses for this purpose; of which the first represents an action in point of time as not yet existing, but as about to exist at some period to come; but it does not bring the completion of the action into view. The other affects the futurity of an action together with its completion. Scribam, \"I shall be writing,\" denotes future time and complete action; for it does not lay whether I am to write for a long or for a short time, or whether I shall finish what I promised to begin. This part of the verb, therefore, to which the Greek ἔρχομαι corresponds, is an imperfect future, and likewise an aorist. The futurity of any action, it should seem, may always be computed from the time of speaking; for every action must be future with respect to the time at which its futurity is declared; but the time of its futurity may be more precisely specified by fixing on some other future time to which to refer it: \"I shall be writing after he shall have departed.\" Shall or will refers to future time indefinitely; and write or writing refers to an action which is indeed to begin and so far to proceed, but of which nothing is said concerning the completion.\n\nOn the other hand, scribere, \"I shall have written,\" is a perfect future denoting complete action; for shall denotes future time; written, finished action; and have, present possession. So that the meaning of the whole affixion\nis, that \"at some future period of time I shall possess the finished action of writing. The completion of the action, together with the possession of it, is always future with respect to the time of assertion; but, with respect to some other time expressed or understood, the completion of the action is to be past: Promissis te scripturum si rogavero, \"you promise to write if I shall have asked you.\" In this sentence the action of asking is future with relation to the time of promising, but it is past with relation to that of writing. This tense the Latin grammarians call the future of the subjunctive mode; but very improperly. The notice which it communicates, respects not the power or liberty of acting, which, as will be seen by and bye, is the characteristic of that mode; but the action itself. It ought therefore to be ranked among the tenses of the indicative mode; for scribendo is, in every sense, as really indicative as scribam or scripturus ero.\n\n68. There are all the tenses, essentially different from each other, which have place in the indicative mode of any language with which we are acquainted (r); but as there are tenses in the mode called Subjunctive, which bear the same names with those already examined, and which have yet a different import, it will be necessary to consider them before we dismiss the subject of tenses.\n\nOf modes in general something must be said hereafter; at present we shall only observe, that the mode with which we are now concerned, is not very properly distinguished by the name assigned to it by the Latin grammarians. They call it the subjunctive, because it is often subjoined to another verb, and forms the secondary clause of a sentence; but the mode called indicative frequently appears in the same circumstances. The difference between these two modes appears to us to consist in this, that the indicative affects something directly concerning the action; the subjunctive, something concerning the power or liberty of the agent to perform it: for that the latter affects as well as the former, admits not of dispute.\n\n69. The present tense of the subjunctive mode, in the learned languages, answers to the English auxiliaries may and can. Let us consider these a little.—May is evidently a verb of the present tense denoting liberty. When I assert that I may write, I give notice that I am under no compulsion to abstain from writing; that there is no impediment from without by which I am restrained from writing. Can is also a verb of the present tense, expressive of internal power or skill. \"I can write\" is equivalent to—\"There is nothing in myself which incapacitates me for performing the operation of writing.\" This verb seems originally to have denoted knowledge or skill, and to have been afterwards extended to signify power or ability of any kind. There is little doubt of its being the same with the old English verb to con, which signifies to know.—The difference between the import of these two verbs may and can will be best perceived in a familiar example. Suppose we say to one of our transcribers, \"You may write a treatise on grammar, to which he returns an answer \"I cannot;\" our assertion evidently supposes him at liberty to write the treatise; his answer implies, that he is unable or unfitted to do it. We may conclude, then, that the present tense of this mode contains a declaration of present liberty, ability, or skill; and its other tenses will be found to have reference to the same capacities.\n\nThe observation is here to be repeated which was enlarged upon under the present of the indicative. The liberty or ability signified by this tense is always represented as present; let the time of this presence be indefinite. If no particular time be specified, we generally refer it to the time of speaking; but another point may be given from which we are to compute, \"When he shall have finished, you may then proceed as you propose.\" Here the liberty of proceeding is stated as present, not at the time of speaking, but at the time of his finishing, which is future to the time of speaking. But though the liberty, ability, or skill, denoted by this tense, be represented as present, the action itself is stated as contingent; for it is not necessary that a man should perform an action because he has the capacity to perform it.\n\nFrom this idea of the present of the subjunctive some of its most peculiar uses seem capable of being explained. —And, in the first place, it appears to have a near affinity with the future of the indicative; inasmuch that in many instances they may be used promiscuously. Without materially altering the effect of the expression, we may say, \"Dico me facturum esse quae imperet,\" or \"quae imperabit.\" The reason of this, perhaps, may be, that with respect to us, futurity and contingency are in most cases nearly the same, both being involved in equal obscurity; and therefore it is often of little consequence which mode of expression we employ.\n\nSecondly, The present of the subjunctive is used to denote\n\n(r) On this point we subscribe to the opinion of the elegant and ingenious Dr Beattie.—\"It will perhaps occur (says he), that there are two Greek tenses, of which I have given no account; namely, the second aorist, and the second future. The truth is, that I consider them as unnecessary. Their place, for anything I know to the contrary, might at all times be supplied by the first aorist and the first future. Some grammarians are of opinion, that the first aorist signifies time past in general, and the second, indefinite time past; and that the first future denotes a nearer, and the second a more remote, futurity. But this, I apprehend, is mere conjecture, unsupported by proof; and therefore I incline rather to the sentiments of those who teach, that the second future and the second aorist have no meaning different from the first future and the first aorist; and that they are the present and imperfect of some obsolete theme of the verb; and, when the other theme came into use, happened to be retained for the sake of variety perhaps, or by accident, with a pretense and future signification. Be this as it will, as these tenses are peculiar to the Greek, and have nothing corresponding to them in other tongues, we need not scruple to overlook them as superfluous.\"—The Theory of Language, Part II. Chap. ii.\n\nTo these judicious observations we have nothing to add, but that they acquire no small degree of confirmation from this circumstance, that there are many Greek verbs which have no second future, and which are yet employed to denote every possible modification of future time. Of the paulo-past-futurum of the Greeks we have taken.\nChap. IV.\n\nVerbs. note the right of which a person is possessed. \"I may, or I can,\" tell this book.\" This application, which Dr Priestley considers as the primary signification of the tense, is easily deduced, or rather follows immediately, from the foregoing account of its import. For if one be under no restraint, either external or internal, to prevent him from performing an action, he has surely a right to perform it.\n\nThirdly, The present of the subjunctive is often used to signify command or request; as when one says, \"You may give my compliments to such a person.\" This use of the tense under consideration seems to have arisen from a desire to soften the harshness of a command, by avoiding the appearance of claiming superiority. When a man utters the above sentence, he certainly utters no command, but only affirms that the person to whom he speaks has liberty or power to do him a favour. This affirmation, however, may contain no new information; and therefore the person addressed, reflecting upon the intention of the speaker in making it, infers that it indicates a wish or desire that \"his compliments should be made to such a person.\"\n\n70. Of the subjunctive as well as of the indicative, the praeter-imperfect is evidently the past time of the present. As the latter affords liberty, or ability, to perform some action, as existing at present, the former affords the same liberty or ability to have existed in time past; but the precise portion of time past, in which these capacities existed, must be specified by other words, or it will remain unknown. Thus in the following sentence, \"Dixi me facturum esse quae imperaret,\" the time of imperaret is referred to that of dixi: the person having the right to command, is supposed to have had it at the time when the other said that he would obey. This tense, as well as the present, states the action as going on and incomplete; and also as future with respect to the liberty or ability to perform it. It is rendered into English by the verbs could or might; of which the first is the past time of can, the second of may.\n\nFrom the near affinity which the present of the subjunctive has to the future of the indicative, the tense now under consideration appears, in many instances, as the past time of the latter as well as the former. Thus Dixi me facturum quae imperaret, may be rendered \"I said that I would do whatever he might, or whatever he should, command.\"\n\n71. Of the praeter-perfect, it is sufficient to observe, that as the present states the agent as at liberty to be performing an unfinished action; so this tense states him as at liberty to perform the action considered as finished. \"I may be writing a letter when you come, i.e. I am at liberty to be writing a letter when you come.\" I may have written a letter when you come,\" i.e. I am at liberty to be in possession of the finished action of writing a letter when you come.\"\n\nIt is a common mode of expression to say, \"I may have done such or such a thing in my time,\" when he who speaks can have little doubt whether he has done the thing or not. In that case, the words may have done, cannot be considered as the praeter-perfect of the subjunctive of the verb do; for it is nonsensical to talk of liberty, with respect to the performance of an action, which, at the time of speaking, is supposed to be past and completed. What then is the import of the phrase? We are persuaded that it is elliptical, and that the word say or affirm is understood: \"I may (say that I) have done such or such a thing in my time;\" for liberty or contingency can relate to actions only as they are conceived to be present or future.\n\n72. Of all the tenses, the most complex is the pluperfective of this mode. It combines a past and a quam-perfective time with a finished action. It may be considered as the past time both of the perfect future and of the praeter-perfect of the subjunctive: for it represents an action, future and contingent at some past time, as finished before another period specified; which period therefore, though past at the time of speaking, was itself future with respect to the time when the futurity or contingency of the action existed. \"Promissisti te scripturam fulle si rogasti sem,\" \"You promised that you would write, if I should have asked you.\" Here the futurity of the action of asking, which is represented as complete and finished, is stated as co-existing with the past promise; but the action itself must be posterior to that promise; it is however supposed to be past with respect to the action of writing, which is also posterior to the promise.\n\n73. Before we dismiss the subject of tenses, it may be improper just to mention number and person; for person, there have place in every tense of the verb in the learned languages, and in many tenses even of the English verb. They cannot, however, be deemed essential to the verb; for affirmation is the same, whether it be made by you, by me, or by a third person, or whether it be made by one man or by a thousand. The most that can be said is, that verbs in the more elegant languages are provided with a variety of terminations which respect the number and person of every substantive, that we may know with more precision, in a complex sentence, each particular substance with its attendant verbal attributes. The same may be said of sex with respect to adjectives. They have terminations which vary as they respect beings male or female, though it is past dispute that substances alone are susceptible of sex. We therefore pass over these matters, and all of like kind, as being rather among the elegancies of particular languages, and therefore to be learned from the particular grammar of each tongue, than among the essentials of language; which essentials alone are the subject of inquiry in a treatise on universal grammar.\n\n74. Besides tenses, number, and person, in every tongue of modes, with which we are acquainted, verbs are subject to another variation, which grammarians have agreed to call Modes. Of modes, as of tenses, it has been warmly disputed whether or not they be essential to language. The truth seems to be, that the only part of the verb absolutely necessary for the purpose of communicating thought is the indicative mode; for all the others, as has been well observed by Dr Gregory, are resolvable, by means of additional verbs and a word denoting the action of the primary verb, into circuitous expressions which taken no notice, because it is found only in the passive voice; to which if it were necessary, it is obvious that it would be necessary in all voices, as a man may be about to act as well as to suffer immediately.\nwhich fully convey their meaning (s). But such expressions continually repeated would make language very prolix and wholly inanimated; for which reason, the import of each of the commonly received modes is a subject worthy of the philologist's investigation. About the number of modes, whether necessary or only expedient, as well as about the import of each, the writers on grammar have differed in opinion. Mr Harris, one of the most celebrated of those writers, has enumerated four modes of the verb, besides the infinitive; viz. The indicative or declarative, to assert what we think certain; the potential or subjunctive, for the purpose of whatever we think contingent; the interrogative, when we are doubtful, to procure us information; and the requisitive, to assist us in the gratification of our volitions. The requisitive too, according to him, appears under two distinct species; either as it is imperative to inferiors, or precative to superiors.\n\nFor establishing such a variety of modes as this, no sort of foundation whatever appears. The same reasoning which induced the author to give us an interrogative and requisitive mode, might have made him give us a hortative, a disjunctive, a volitive, and innumerable other modes, with which no language is acquainted. But besides perplexing his reader with useless distinctions, we cannot help thinking that Mr Harris has fallen into some mistakes with regard to the import of those modes which are universally acknowledged. According to him, assertion is the characteristic of the indicative, and that which distinguishes it from the subjunctive or potential: but this is certainly not true, for without an assertion, the verb cannot be used in any mode. Of this the learned author, indeed, seems to have been aware, when he observed of the subjunctive mode, that it is employed \"when we do not strictly affirm,\" and that \"it implies but a dubious and conjectural assertion.\" The truth is, that the assertion implied in this mode, though it is not concerning the same thing, is equally positive and absolute with that conveyed by the indicative. An example quoted by himself should have set him right as to this matter:\n\n*Sed tacitus paci si posset corsus, HABEBET*\n*Plus dapis, &c.*\n\nWho does not feel that the assertion contained in habebet, is as absolute and positive as any assertion whatever?\n\n75. Perhaps we may be asked to define what we mean by a mode. We know not that we can define it to universal satisfaction. Thus much, however, seems to be obvious, that those variations which are called modes do not imply different modifications of the action of the verb. Amo, Amem, Anna, do not signify modes of loving; for modes of loving are, loving much, loving little, loving long, &c.—Shall we then get over the difficulty by saying, with Mr Harris, that \"modes exhibit some way or other the soul and its affections?\" This is certainly true; but it is nothing to the purpose; for it does not distinguish the meaning of mode from the object of language in general, all languages being intended to exhibit the soul and its affections.\n\nGrammatical modes of verbs have been defined by Dr Gregory to be \"concise modes of expressing some fixed, of those combinations of thoughts which occur most frequently, and are most important and striking.\" This is a just observation; but perhaps he would have given a more complete definition had he said, that grammatical modes of verbs are concise modes of expressing some of those combinations of thoughts which occur most frequently, and of which assertion is an essential part (t). This indeed seems to be the real account of the matter, especially if our notion of the nature of verb be well founded,\n\n(s) The imperative, for instance, may be resolved into a verb of commanding in the first person of the present of the indicative, and a word denoting the action of the primary verb, commonly called the infinitive mode of that verb. Thus, *I nunc et versus tecum meditare canoros,* and \"*Jubeo te nunc ire et tecum meditari,*\" &c., are sentences of the very same import. The subjunctive may be resolved in the same manner by means of a verb denoting power or capacity; for credam, and possim credere, may be often used indifferently. The indicative mode, however, is not thus convertible with another verb of affirming in the first person of the present of the indicative, and a word denoting the action of the primary verb; for Titius scribit, \"*Titius writes,*\" is not of the same import with *dico Titium scribere, quod Titius scribat,* \"I say that Titius writes.\" The first of these sentences, as has been already shown, contains but one assertion; the second obviously contains two. Titius writes, is equivalent to Titius is writing; I say that Titius writes, is equivalent to I am saying that Titius is writing. The reason why the imperative and subjunctive are resolvable into expressions into which the indicative cannot be resolved, will be seen when the import of each of those modes is ascertained.\n\n(t) Every verb, except the simple verb *am, art, is,* &c., expresses without modes a combination of thoughts, viz. affirmation and an attribute. The affirmation, however, alone is essential to the verb, for the attribute may be expressed by other words. It is indeed extremely probable, that in the earliest ages of the world, the affirmation and attribute were always expressed by different words; and that afterwards, for the sake of conciseness, one word, compounded perhaps of these two, was made to express both the affirmation and the attribute: hence arose the various classes of verbs, active, passive, and neuter. Of a process of this kind there are evident signs in the Greek and some other tongues. But the improvers of language stopped not here. The same love of conciseness induced them to modify the compound verb itself, that it might express various combinations of thought still more complex; but in all these combinations assertion was of necessity included; for if the word had ceased to assert, it would have ceased to be a verb of any kind.\n\nSoon after this short note was written, and the whole article finished for the press, we accidentally met with Pickbourn's Dissertation on the English Verb. Of that work it belongs not to us to give a character. Such of our readers as shall peruse it, will see that on many points we differ widely in opinion from the author; but we have no painful apprehension of any comparison which may be made. It gives us pleasure, however, to find,\nthat his notions respecting the origin of such verbs as express at once assertion and an attribute, are the same with those which had occurred to ourselves.\n\n\"The copula is appears (says Mr Pickbourn) to have been coeval with language itself. But we have not the same evidence to convince us, that that must necessarily have been the case of any other finite verb; for the copula is, containing only an affirmation, is much more simple than a verb which unites in one word both an attribute and an affirmation. Since therefore people, in their first attempts to express their ideas by words, would scarcely think of anything more than what was absolutely necessary, it is probable they would be some time before they invented any other word containing in itself an affirmation or affirmation; for they would not very early think of contriving words so complex in their nature as to include in them both the name of an action and an affirmation.\n\n\"I conjecture, that the first mode of expressing actions or passions would be by participles or verbal nouns, i.e., words signifying the names of the actions or passions they wanted to describe; and these words connected with their subject by the copula is, might in those rude beginnings of language tolerably well supply the place of verbs: e.g., from observing the operations of nature, such words as rain or raining, thunder or thundering, would soon be invented; and by adding the copula is, they would say, thundering or thunder is or is not, raining or rain is; which, by the rapidity of pronunciation, might in time form the verbs rains, thunders, &c. The observation of their own actions, or the actions of the animals around them, would soon increase their stock of ideas, and put them upon contriving suitable expressions for them. Hence might arise such words as these: sleep or sleeping, stand or standing, run or running, bite or biting, hurt or hurting; and by joining these to substantives by means of the copula is, they might form such sentences as these,—Lion is sleeping, or perhaps lion sleep is, stand is, &c., which would soon be contracted into lion sleeps, stands, runs, bites, hurts, &c. Thus our little inflated family might become possessed of verbs including an attribute and an affirmation in one word.\"\n\nThis account of the origin of active, passive, and neuter verbs, is certainly ingenious; and, in our opinion, it is not more ingenious than just when applied to the Greek and other ancient languages, though it is not applicable to the English; but it seems to be quite irreconcilable with the definition of verb, which the author has adopted from Bishop Lowth; and indeed with every other definition except that which makes the essence of verb to consist in simple affirmation.\n\n(v) Of a question put in the form of an assertion we have a remarkable instance in the Gospel of St Matthew. When Christ stood before Pilate, the governor asked him, saying, Σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεύς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. That this sentence was pronounced with a view to obtain some answer, is evident from the context; yet it is as plainly an affirmation, though uttered probably in a scoffing tone, as the serious confession of Nathaniel, Σὺ εἶ ὁ βασιλεύς τῶν Ἰουδαίων. Had not the question been put in this form, which affirms Christ to be the king of the Jews, the reply could not have been Σὺ λέγεις; for without an assertion the governor would have said nothing. See Dr Campbell's Translation of the Gospels, where the form used in the original is with great propriety retained in the version.\ntence may either be an abbreviation for *die an fecisti*, \"tell me if you did it?\" or *an* may perhaps be, as if certainly is, the imperative mode of some obsolete verb equivalent to *give*; and in that case, *an fecisti* will be a complete interrogative sentence, signifying, \"you did it, give that.\"—But of the interrogative mode of Mr Harris we have said enough; perhaps our readers will think too much, since it is a useless distinction not found in any language. It will, however, be proper to say something of his optative mode, as far as it is the same with the optative mode of the Greek grammarians. And,\n\n77. Nothing, we think, can be clearer, than that the Greek optative constitutes no distinct mode of the verb, whatever meaning be annexed to the word mode. The different tenes of the optative are evidently nothing but the past tenes of the corresponding tenes of the subjunctive. Pref. sub. *τυχοίμην*, I may strike. Pref. opt. *τυχοίμην*, I might strike, &c. This is proved to be indubitably the case by the uniform practice of the Greek writers. Examples might be found without number were one to read in search of them. The following sentence will illustrate our meaning: *Εξερευνήσαντες Ἀθηναῖοι τὸ παράλιον τῶν Ἀργείων*, \"the Athenians came that they may afflict the Argives.\" Here the leading verb *ἐξερευνήσαντες* being of the present tense, the dependent verb *παράλιον* is the present subjunctive. But change the former to the past time, and the latter must also be changed. *Ἔξερεν Ἀθηναῖοι παράλιον τῶν Ἀργείων*, \"the Athenians came that they might afflict the Argives.\" Here it is plain that *παράλιον*, the present of the optative, is the past time of *παράλιον*, the present of the subjunctive; and the same in other instances.\n\nIt is almost unnecessary to add, that when this mode is employed to denote a wish, the wish is not expressed by the verb, but is underwood. Such abbreviated expressions to denote a wish are common in all languages. Thus, in Greek,\n\n*Τρέχει με τὸ δόξα, ἀναπτύξει δόξαν εὐχόμενος*\n\n*Ἐκπροσώπει Περσικὸν πάλιν*, &c.\n\nsignifies, \"The gods might give you (or, as we say in English, changing the position of the verb, might the gods give you) to destroy,\" &c. So in Latin, *Ut te omnes dii deoque perdant*, \"That all the gods and goddesses may curse you!\" Again, in English, \"O that my head were waters!\" &c. In all these, and such like sentences, the words equivalent to *I wish*, I pray, are underwood. In Greek a wish is sometimes introduced by the particle *ὅ* or *ὅτι*, if; as in Homer,\n\n*Ἤδη ἔρχεται ἐξέρευνε τῆς ῥώμης, ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἀνευρέσθαι*\n\n\"If it had been your fate not to be born, or to die unmarried! The supplement is, \"It would have been happy for your country,\" or some such thing. In like manner, a poor person not uncommonly intreates a favour by saying, \"Sir, if you would be so good!\" Here he stops; but the completion of his sentence is, \"It would make me happy.\" In all these cases a wish is not formally expressed by the speaker, but inferred by the hearer. They are therefore instances of that tendency which mankind universally discover to abbreviate their language, especially in cases where the passions or feelings are interested.\n\n78. The interrogative and optative modes being set aside as superfluous, it would appear from our investigation, that the real distinct modes of the verb, which are only three found in the most copious and varied language, are on-modes nearly three; the indicative, the subjunctive, and the imperative; the indicative, the subjunctive, and the imperative; the first to indicate the speaker's feeling or acting, and the second to indicate his capacity of feeling or acting, and the third to indicate his desire that the person to whom he speaks should feel or act.\n\nHere again we have the misfortune to find ourselves differ in opinion with Dr Gregory; who seems to think, that a greater number of modes, if not absolutely necessary, would, however, be highly useful. His words are: \"All languages, I believe, are defective in respect of that variety and accuracy of combination and of distinction, which we know with infallible certainty take place in thought. Nor do I know of any particular in which language is more deficient than in the expressing of those energies or modifications of thought; some of which always are, and all of which might be, expressed by the grammatical moods of verbs. Of this there cannot be a clearer proof than the well-known fact, that we are obliged to express by the same mood very different modifications or energies of thought. As, for instance, in the case of the grammatical mood called the imperative, by which we express occasionally prayer to God, command to a slave, request to a superior, advice to an equal or to any one, order as from an officer to his subaltern, supplication to one whom we cannot refuse.\"—If these be, as the author calls them, specific differences of thought, he will not surely object to their being all ranked under one genus, which may be called desire (x). That the internal feelings, which prompt us to pray to God, to command a slave, to request a superior, to advise an equal, to give an order to an inferior, and to supplicate one whom we cannot refuse, are all different in degree, cannot be denied. Each of them, however, is desire; and the predication, by which the desire is made known to the person whom we address, is the same in all, when we utter a prayer as when we utter a command, when we request as when we supplicate. But predication alone is that which constitutes the verb; for desire by itself, however modified, can be expressed only by an abstract noun; and the mere energy of desire, when not applied to a particular energizer, can be expressed only by a participle, or by what is commonly, though improperly, called the infinitive mode. Now it is certainly conceivable, that a few shades of meaning, or a few (y) degrees of one general energy, might be marked\n\n(x) \"Desire;—wish; with eagerness to obtain or enjoy.\" Johnson.\n\n\"The uneasiness a man finds in himself upon the absence of any thing, whose present enjoyment carries the idea of delight with it, is that we call Desire. Good and evil, present and absent, work upon the mind; but that which immediately determines the will, from time to time, to every voluntary action, is the uneasiness of Desire, fixed upon some absent good.\" Locke.\n\nThis whether it be found philosophy or not, is surely sufficient authority for using the word desire to denote the genus; of which prayer, command, advice, supplication, &c., may be considered as so many distinct species.\n\n(y) Dr Gregory seems to think, that not barely a few, but a vast number, of these energies might be so marked.\nby corresponding variations of such verbs as combine energy with predication; and there could be no great propriety in calling those variations modes, or rather modes of modes: but that such a multiplication of modes would be an improvement in language, is by no means evident. The verb, with the modes and tenses which it has in all languages, is already a very complex part of speech; which few are able, and still fewer inclined, to analyze: and it would surely be of no advantage to make it more complex by the introduction of new modes, especially when those degrees of energy which could be marked by them are with equal and perhaps greater precision marked, in the living speech, by the different tones of voice adapted to them by nature; and, in written language, by the reader's general knowledge of the subject, and of the persons who may be occasionally introduced. If there be any particular delicacy of sentiment, or energy, which cannot thus be made known, it is better to express it by a name appropriated to itself, together with the simple and original verb of affirmation, than to clog the compound verb with such a multiplicity of variations as would render the acquisition of every language as difficult as is said to be that of the Chinese written characters.\n\nThe indicative, subjunctive, and imperative, are therefore all the modes of the verb which to us appear to be in any degree necessary or expedient; and they are in fact all the modes that are really found in any language with which we are acquainted.\n\nFor the infinitive, as has been already observed, seems on every account to be improperly styled a mode. To that name it has no title which we can perceive, except that its termination sometimes (for even this is not true universally) differs in the learned languages from the terminations of the other parts of the verb. Nay, if affirmation be, as it has been proved to be, the very essence of verb, it will follow, that the infinitive is no part of the verb at all; for it expresses no affirmation. It forms no complete sentence by itself, nor even when joined to a noun, unless it be aided by some real part of a verb either expressed or underflowed.\n\nScribo, scriberebam, scripsit, scripsitrem, scribamus, scripsero; \"I am writing, I was writing, I have written, I had written, I shall write, I shall have written,\" do each of them contain an affirmation, and constitute a complete sentence: but scribere \"to write,\" scripsisse \"to have written,\" affirm nothing, and are not more applicable to any one person than to another. In a word, the infinitive is nothing more than an abstract noun (z), denoting the simple energy of the verb, in conjunction with\n\nAffirming (says he), denying, testifying, foretelling, asking, answering, wishing, hoping, expecting, believing, knowing, doubting, supposing, stipulating, being able, commanding, praying, requesting, supplicating, loving, hating, fearing, despairing, being accustomed, wondering, admiring, wavering, swearing, advising, refusing, exhorting, diffusing, encouraging, promising, threatening, &c., all admit very readily of being combined with the general import of a verb.\" He adds, that \"if every one of them had been expressed in all languages by variations as striking as those of vivere, vivendi, and vivit, they must have been acknowledged as distinct moods of the verb.\"\n\nIf all these words denote different energies of thought, which, however, may be doubted, and if all those different energies, with many others for which, as the author justly observes, it is not easy to find names, could, like capacity and desire, be combined with the general action or energy of one verb; and if those combinations could be marked by corresponding variations of that verb; we should indeed acknowledge such variations to be distinct modes, or modes of modes, of the verb. But we doubt much if all this be possible. We are certain that it would be no improvement: for it seems to be evident, either that, in some of the modes, the radical letters of the original verb must be changed, and then it would cease to be the same verb; or that many of the modes must be expressed by words of very unmanageable length; not to mention that the additional complication introduced by so many minute distinctions into a part of speech already exceedingly complex, would render the import of the verb absolutely unintelligible to nine-tenths even of those who are justly styled the learned.\n\n(z) In our idea of the infinitive, we have the honour to agree with the learned and excellent Ruddiman; whose words are, \"Non ineptè hic modus a veteribus quibusdam verbi nomen est appellatum. Est enim (si non verè ac semper, quod nonnulli volunt, nomen substantivum) significatione certè ei maximè affinis; ejusque vices fullinct per omnes causas. Et quidem manifestè substantivum videtur, cum adjectivum et additur neutri generis: ut, Cic. Att. xiii. 28. Cum vivere ipsum turpe fit nobis.—Perf. v. 53. Velle suum cuoque eft.—Cic. Fin. i. r. Totum hoc displicet philosophari.—Petron. c. 52. Meum intelligere nulla pecunia vendo. Item, absque adjectivo: ut, Ovid Met. ii. 483. Posse loqui eripitur, i.e. potefias loquendi.—Plaut. Bacch. i. 2. 50. Hic vereri perditit, i.e. verecundiam.—Cic. Tufc. v. 38. Loquor de docto homine et erudito, cui vivere eft cogitare, i.e. cujus vita eft cogitatio. [Grammaticae Latinae Institutiones: Pars secunda, lib. i. cap. 2. where the reader will find examples of the infinitive used by the best Roman writers as a substantive noun in every case.]\n\nThis opinion of Ruddiman and his ancient grammarians has been lately controverted with much ingenuity by Dr Gregory; who seems to think, that in the infinitive alone we should look for the essence of the verb divested of every accidental circumstance, time only excepted. If this be indeed the case, almost everything which we have said of the verb, its tenses, and its modes, is erroneous; and he who takes his principles of grammar from the Encyclopaedia, will fill his head with a farrago of absurdities. The writer of the article, however, has been at much pains to acquire correct notions of the subject; he has studied the writings of others; he\nwith time; and is not a mode, as far as we can conceive, of any thing. Thus, Scire tuum nihil est, is the same with Scientia tua nihil est; and, \"Death is certain,\" with \"To die is certain.\"\n\n79. Before we dismiss the subject of mode, it may not be improper to take notice of the connection which Mr Harris, after Apollonius, has found between commanding and futurity. \"Intreating and commanding (he says) have a necessary respect to the future only. For what have they to do with the present and the past, the natures of which are immutable and necessary?\" This is surely confounding commands with the execution of commands. But the learned writer proceeds to inform us, that \"it is from the connection of futurity with commands, that the future of the indicative is sometimes used for the imperative mode.\" The connection, of which he speaks, appears to us entirely imaginary; for futurity has nothing to do with commands, though it may\n\nhas consulted several persons of undoubted learning, who have devoted a great part of their time to grammatical investigations; and he is extremely unwilling to suppose, that all his inquiries respecting the most important part of speech have ended in error. He trusts, therefore, that he shall not be deemed a petulant caviller, though he examine with some severity the principal observations and arguments upon which the Doctor has built his theory. Upon that examination he enters with diffidence: for the learned Professor's knowledge of the various powers of the mind appears, even in this essay, to be such as eminently qualifies him for ascertaining the precise import of every species of words employed for the purpose of communicating thought; and with such a man the present writer would be much happier to agree than to differ in opinion.\n\nThe Doctor acknowledges (Trans. of the Royal Society, Edinburgh, vol. ii. lit. clas. p. 195), that the infinitive is most improperly called a mode: and on that account he thinks we ought to turn our thoughts exclusively to it, \"when we endeavour to investigate the general import of the verb, with a view to ascertain the accident which it denotes; and be led, step by step, to form a distinct notion of what is common in the accidents of all verbs, and what is peculiar in the accidents of the several classes of them, and thereby be enabled to give good definitions, specifying the essence of the verb,\" &c. It may be true, that to the infinitive exclusively we should turn our attention, when we wish to ascertain the accident denoted by a particular verb or class of verbs; i.e., the kind of action, passion, or state of being, of which, superadded to affirmation, that verb or class of verbs is expressive: but in accidents of this kind it may be doubted if there be any thing that with propriety can be said to be common to all verbs. There seems indeed to be nothing common to all verbs but that which is essential to them, and by which they are distinguished from every other part of speech; but every kind of action, passion, and state of being, may be completely expressed by participles and abstract nouns; and therefore in such accidents we cannot find the essence of the verb, because such accidents distinguish it not from other parts of speech. Were a man called upon to specify the essence of verbs or metre, he would not say, that it consists in the meaning of the words, or in the using of these words according to the rules of syntax. In every kind of verse where words are used they have indeed a meaning, and in all good verses they are grammatically constructed; but this is likewise the case in prose, and therefore it cannot be the essence of verbs. The essence of verbs must consist in something which is not to be found in prose, viz. a certain harmonic succession of sounds and number of syllables: and the essence of the verb must likewise consist in something which is not to be found in any other part of speech; and that, we are persuaded, is nothing but affirmation. But if affirmation be the very essence of the verb, it would surely be improper, when we endeavour to ascertain the general import of that part of speech, to turn our thoughts exclusively to a word which implies no affirmation; for what does not affirm, cannot in strictness of truth be either a verb or the mode of a verb.\n\nIn the same page it is said, that \"the infinitive denotes that kind of thought or combination of thoughts which is common to all the other modes.\" In what sense this is true, we are unable to conceive: it denotes indeed the same accident, but certainly not the same thought or combination of thoughts. In the examples quoted, Non eft vivere, sed valere vita, &c., the infinitives have evidently the effect of abstract nouns, and not of verbs; for though vivere and valere express the same states of being with vivo and valeo, they by no means express the same combination of thoughts. Vivo and valeo affirm that I am living, and that I am well; and he who utters these words must think not of life and health in the abstract, but of life and health as belonging to himself. Vivere and valere, on the other hand, affirm nothing; and he who utters them thinks only of the states of living and of being in health, without applying them to any particular person.\n\nThe exquisitely learned author of The Origin and Progress of Language, having said that the infinitive is used either as a noun, or that it serves to connect the verb with another verb or a noun, and so is useful in syntax, the Doctor combats this opinion and infers the infinitive to be truly a verb; because \"the thought expressed\nVerbs. still commonly employed. In English, therefore, the foregoing process of inferring a command from an affirmation of futurity seems to have been reversed; and the word itself, from denoting a command or obligation, has come to denote futurity simply.\n\n86 Of verbs, as they are active, passive, or neuter, and its modes, we might seem to have exhausted the subject; but there is still something more to be done. Grammarians have distinguished verbs into several species: and it remains with us to inquire upon what principle in nature this distinction is made, and how far it proceeds. Now it must be obvious, that if predication be the essence of verb, all verbs, as such, must be of the same species; for predication is the same in every proposition, under every possible circumstance, and by whomsoever it is made. But the greater part of verbs contain the predicate as well as the predication of a proposition; or, to speak in common language, they denote an attribute as well as an affirmation. Thus, lego is \"I am reading;\" ambulo, \"I am walking;\" flo, \"I am standing;\" verbero, \"I am striking;\" verberor, \"I am strucken.\" But the attributes expressed by these verbs are evidently of different kinds; some consisting in action, some in suffering, and some in a state of being which is neither active nor passive. Hence the distinction of verbs, according to the attributes which they denote, into active, passive, and neuter. Lego, which is an assertion that I am employed in the act of reading, is an active verb; verberor, which is an assertion that I am suffering under the rod, is a passive verb, because it denotes a passion; and flo, which is an assertion that I am standing still, is said to be a neuter verb, because it denotes neither action nor passion. But it is self-evident that there cannot be action without an agent, nor passion without\n\nVol. X. Part I.\n\nby means of it, may be expressed in synonymous and convertible phrases, in different languages, by means of other parts or moods of the verb.\" Of these synonymous and convertible phrases he gives several examples, of which the first is taken from Hamlet's soliloquy. \"To be or not to be, that is the question,\" he thinks equivalent in meaning to, \"The question is, whether we shall be or shall not be?\" But we are persuaded he is mistaken. \"Whether we shall be or shall not be,\" is a question asking, whether we shall exist at some future and indefinite time? but the subject of Hamlet's debate with himself was not, Whether, if his conscious existence should be interrupted, it would be afterwards at some future and indefinite time restored? but whether it was to continue uninterrupted by his exit from this world? This, we think, must be self-evident to every reader of the Soliloquy. It is likewise very obvious, that the word question in this sentence does not signify interrogatory, but subject of debate or affair to be examined; and that the word that serves for no other purpose than to complete the verse, and give additional emphasis, perhaps, to an inquiry so important. \"To be or not to be, that is the question,\" is therefore equivalent in all respects to \"The continuance or non-continuance of my existence, is the matter to be examined;\" and the infinitive is here indubitably used as an abstract noun in the nominative case. Should it be said, that the Doctor may have taken the sentence by itself, unconnected with the subject of Hamlet's soliloquy; we beg leave to reply that the supposition is impossible; for, independent of the circumstances with which they are connected, the words \"To be or not to be,\" have no perfect meaning. Were it not for the subject of the soliloquy, from which every reader supplies what is wanting to complete the sense, it might be asked, \"To be or not to be—What? A coward, a murderer, a king, or a dead man! Questions all equally reasonable, and which in that case could not be answered.\n\nWith the same view, to prove the infinitive to be truly a verb, the Doctor proceeds to remark upon the following phrases, Dico, credo, puto, Titium exsiliere, valere, jacerere, eccidifere, procumbere, proiectum fuisse a Mæno; which, he says, have the very same meaning with dico, quod Titius exsilit, quod jaceat, quod occiderit, &c. He adds, that \"the infinitives, as thus used, acquire not any further meaning, in addition to the radical import of the verb with tense, like the proper moods; but the subjunctives after quod lose their peculiar meaning as moods, and signify no more than bare infinitives.\" In the sense in which this observation is made by the author, the very reverse of it seems to be the truth. The infinitives, as thus used, acquire, at least in the mind of the reader, something like the power of affirmation, which they certainly have not when standing by themselves; whereas, the subjunctives neither lose nor acquire any meaning by being placed after quod. Dico, credo, puto, Titium exsiliere, valere, jacerere, &c. when translated literally, signify, I say, believe, think, Titius to exsili, to lie well, to lie along; a mode of speaking which, though now not elegant, was common with the best writers in the days of Shakespeare, and is frequently to be found in the writings of Warburton at the present day. Dico, credo, puto, quod Titius exsilit, quod jaceat, &c. signifies literally, I say, believe, think, that Titius may exsili, may lie along, &c. Remove the verbs in the indicative mode from the former set of phrases, and it will be found that the infinitives had acquired a meaning, when conjoined with them, which they have not when left by themselves; for Titium exsiliere, jacerere; \"Titius to exsili, to lie along,\" have no complete meaning, because they affirm nothing. On the other hand, when the indicative verbs are removed, together with the wonder-working quod, from the latter set of phrases, the meaning of the subjunctives remains in all respects as it was before the removal; for Titius exsilit, jaceat, &c. signify, Titius may exsili, may lie along, as well when they stand by themselves as when they make the final clauses of a compound sentence. Every one knows that quod, though often called a conjunction, is always in fact the relative pronoun. Dico, credo, puto, quod Titius exsilit, must therefore be construed thus: Titius exsilit (est id) quod dico, credo, &c. \"Titius may exsili is that thing, that proposition, which I say, believe, think.\" In the former set of phrases, the infinitives are used as abstract nouns in the accusative case, denoting, in conjunction with Titium, one complex conception, the existence, &c. of Titius: Dico, credo, puto; I say, believe, think; and the object of my speech, belief, thought, is Titium exsiliere, \"the existence of Titius.\"\nwithout a passive being; neither can we make a predication of any kind, though it denote neither action nor passi-\non, without predicating of something. All verbs, there-\nfore, whether active, passive, or neuter, have a neces-\nsary reference to some noun expressive of the sub-\nstance, of which the attribute, denoted by the verb,\nis predicated. This noun, which in all languages must\nbe in the nominative case, is said to be the nominative\nto the verb; and in those languages in which the verb\nhas person and number, it must in these respects agree\nwith its nominative.\n\nOf action, and consequently of verbs denoting action,\nthere are obviously two kinds. There is an action which\npasses from the agent to some subject, upon which he is\nemployed; and there is an action which respects no ob-\nject beyond the agent himself. Thus lego and ambulo\nare verbs which equally denote action; but the action of\nlogo refers to some external object as well as to the agent;\nfor when a man is reading, he must be reading some-\nthing, a book, a newspaper, or a letter, &c.; whereas,\nthe action of ambulo is confined wholly to the agent; for\nwhen a man is walking, he is employed upon nothing\nbeyond himself,—his action produces no effect upon any-\nthing external. These two species of verbs have been\ndenominated transitive and intransitive; a designation ex-\ntremely proper, as the distinction which gave rise to it\nis philosophically just. Verbs of both species are active; participles,\nbut the action of those only which are called transitive\nrespects an external object; and therefore in those lan-\nguages of which the nouns have cases, it is only after\nthe verbs which are transitive as well as active, that the only\nnoun denoting the subject of the action is put in the ac-\ncusative or objective case. Verbs which are intransitive,\nthough they be really active, are in the structure of the\nsentences considered as neuter, and govern no case.\n\nAnd so much for that most important of all words\nthe verb. We proceed now to the consideration of\nparticiples, adjectives, and adverbs; which as they have\na near relation to one another, we shall treat of in the\nsame chapter.\n\nCHAP. V. Of Participles, Adjectives, and Adverbs.\n\nSECT. I. Of Participles.\n\n81. The nature of verbs being understood, that of participles\nparticiples is not of difficult comprehension. Every\nverb, except that which is called the substantive verb, is ex-\npressive of an attribute, of time, and of an afflention. Now\nif we take away the afflention, and thus destroy the verb,\nthere will remain the attribute and the time; and these\ncombined make the essence of that species of words call-\n\nIn confirmation of the same idea, that the infinitive is truly a verb, the author quotes from Horace a passage,\nwhich, had we thought quotations necessary, we should have urged in support of our own opinion:\n\nNec quicquam tibi prodest\nAërias tentasse domos, animoque rotundum\nPercurrire polum, moritura.\n\nTo our apprehension, nothing can be clearer than that tentasse and percurrire are here used as nouns; for if\nthey be not, where shall we find a nominative to the verb prodest? It was certainly what was signified by tentasse\naërias domos, animoque rotundum percurrire polum, that is said to have been no advantage to Archytas at his\ndeath. This indeed, if there could be any doubt about it, would be made evident by the two prose versions,\nwhich the professor subjoins to these beautiful lines. The first of which is as follows: Nec quicquam tibi prodest\nquod aërias domos tentaveris, et animo percurreris polum; which must be thus constructed: Tentaveris aërias\ndomos, et percurreris animo polum (cf id.) quod nec quicquam tibi prodest. This version, however, is not perfectly\naccurate; for it contains two propositions, while Horace's lines contain but one. The second, which, though it\nmay be a crabbed inelegant sentence, expresses the poet's sense with more precision, is in these words: Nec\nquicquam tibi prodest moritura tua tentatio domum aëriarum, et cursus tuus circa polum. Having observed, with\ntruth, that this sentence has the very same meaning with the lines of Horace, Dr Gregory asks, \"Why are\nnot tentatio and cursus reckoned verbs as well as tentasse and percurrire?\" Let those answer this question who\nbelieve that any of these words are truly verbs; for they are surely, as he adds, all very near akin; indeed so\nnear, that the mind, when contemplating the import of each, cannot perceive the difference. Meanwhile,\nwe beg leave in our turn to ask, Why are not tentasse and percurrire reckoned abstract nouns as well as tentatio\nand cursus? To this question it is not easy to conceive what answer can be returned upon the Doctor's\nprinciples. In his theory there is nothing satisfactory; and what has not been done by himself, we expect\nnot from his followers. On the other hand, our principles furnish a very obvious reason for excluding\ntentatio and cursus from the class of verbs; it is, because these words express no predication. Tentasse and\npercurrire indeed denote predication no more than tentatio and cursus; and therefore upon the same principle we\nexclude them likewise from a class to which, if words are to be arranged according to their import, they certainly\ndo not belong.\n\nShould the reader be inclined to think that we have dwelt too long on this point, we beg him to reflect, that if\nour ideas of the essence of the verb and of the nature of the infinitive be erroneous, every thing which we have\nsaid of modes and tenses is erroneous likewise. We were therefore willing to try the solidity of those principles\nwhich hold the essence of the verb to consist in energy: and we selected Dr Gregory's theory for the subject of\nexamination, not from any disrespect to the author, whom the writer of this article never saw; but because we be-\nlieve his abilities to be such, that\n\nSi Pergama dextrá\nDefendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent.\nParticiples. ed PARTICIPLES. Thus, take away the affeotion from the verb γραφω write, and there remains the participle γραφον writing; which, without the affeotion, denotes the same attribute and the same time. After the same manner, by withdrawing the affeotion, we discover γραφες written in γραφεια wrote; γραφων about to write in γραφων shall be writing. This is Mr Harris's doctrine respecting participles; which, in our opinion, is equally elegant, perspicuous, and just. It has, however, been controverted by an author, whose rank in the republic of letters is such, that we should be wanting in respect to him, and in duty to our readers, were we to pass his objections wholly unnoticed.\n\n82. It is acknowledged by Dr Beattie, that this, which we have taken, is the most convenient light in which the participle can be considered in universal grammar: and yet he affirms that present participles do not always express present time, nor preterite participles past time; nay, that participles have often no connection with time at all. He thus exemplifies his affeotion, in Greek, in Latin, and in English:\n\n\"When Cebes says, Ἐπεγέννησεν περιπατώντες, εἰς τὸ τοῦ Χρόνου ἰσχυρόν 'We were walking in the temple of Saturn,' the participle of the present walking, is, by means of the verb were, applied to time past; and therefore of itself cannot be understood to signify any sort of time.\" Again, after observing, that in English we have but two simple participles, such as writing and written, of which the former is generally considered as the present and the latter as the past, the Doctor adds, But \"the participle writing, joined to a verb of different tenses, may denote either past or future action; for we may say not only, I am writing, but also I was writing yesterday, and I shall be writing tomorrow;\" whence he infers that no time whatever is denoted by the present participle. But surely this is a hasty inference, drawn from the doctrine of absolute time and a definite present, which we have already shown to be groundless and contradictory. When we speak simply of an action as present, we must mean that it is present with respect to something besides itself, or we speak a jargon which is unintelligible, but we do not ascertain the time of its presence. From the very nature of time, an action may be present now, it may have been present formerly, or it may be present at some future period; but the precise time of its presence cannot be ascertained even by the present of the indicative of the verb itself; yet who ever supposed that the present of the indicative denotes no time? The participle of the present represents the action of the verb as going on; but an action cannot be going on without being present in time with something. When, therefore, Cebes says, \"We were walking in the temple of Saturn,\" he represents the action of the verb walk as present with something; but by using the verb expressive of his affeotion in a past tense, he gives us to understand that the action was not present with anything at the period of his speaking, but at some portion of time prior to that period; what that portion of time was, must be collected from the subsequent parts of his discourse. The same is to be said of the phrase I was writing yesterday, and I shall be writing tomorrow. They indicate, that the action of the verb write was present with me yesterday, and will again be present with me tomorrow. The action, and the time of action, are denoted by the participle; that action is affirmed to belong to me by means of the verb; and the time at which it belongs. Adjectives, ed to me is pointed out by the tenses of that verb, am, was, and shall be. All this is so plain, that it could not have escaped Dr Beattie's penetration, had he not hastily adopted the absurd and contradictory notion of a definite present.\n\nOf the truth of his affeotion respecting past participles, he gives a Greek and a Latin example. The former is taken from St Mark: ἐνεργοῦσα, καθολίζων; and the latter is that which is commonly called the perfect future of the passive verb amor, amatus fuero. In the first instance, he says that the participle, though belonging to the aorist of the past time, must be rendered either by the indefinite present, \"he who believeth;\" or by the future, \"he who will believe;\" and the reason which he gives for this rendering of the word is, that \"the believing here spoken of is considered as posterior in time to the enunciation of the promise.\" This is indeed true, but it is not to the purpose; for with the enunciation of the promise, the time of the participle has no manner of concern. The time of enunciation depends entirely upon the time of συμβαίνειν, with respect to which it must undoubtedly be past. Our Lord is not here affirming, that he who shall believe at the day of final retribution, shall be saved; but that he who shall on that day be found to have believed in time past, shall be saved; and if the participle had not been expressive of a finished action and a past time, the whole sentence would have conveyed a meaning not friendly to the interests of the gospel. In like manner, the time of amatus is referred, not to the time of speaking, but to the time of fuero, with respect to which, who sees not that it is past? The two words, taken together, contain a declaration, that he who utters them shall, at some time posterior to that of speaking, have been loved; shall have been loved denotes two times, both future with respect to the time of speaking; but when the time, denoted by shall have, comes to be present, that of the participle loved must be past, for it is declared that the action of it shall then be complete and finished.\n\nWe conclude, then, that it is essential to a participle to express both an attribute and time; and that such words as denote no time, though they may be in the form of participles, as doctus \"learned,\" eloquens \"eloquent,\" &c. belong to another part of speech, which we now proceed to consider.\n\nSECT. II. Of Adjectives.\n\n83. The nature of verbs and participles being un-Adjectives, that of ADJECTIVES becomes easy. A verb denotes attributes (as we have said) an attribute, time, and an affeotion; a participle implies only an attribute and time; and to subjoin an adjective implies only an attribute as belonging to some substance. In other words, an adjective has no affeotion, and it denotes only such an attribute as has not its essence either in motion or its privation. Thus, in general, the attributes of quantity, quality, and relation, such as many, few, great, little, black, white, good, bad, double, treble, &c. are all denoted by adjectives.\n\n84. To understand the import and the use of this They have species of words, it must be observed that every adjective the import is refolvable into a substantive and an expression of connection equivalent to of. Thus, a good man is a man of therewith goodness; where we see the attribute denoted by the adjective fully expressed by an abstract noun. But it is of a con-\nAdjectives, evident that the noun goodness does not express the whole meaning of the adjective good; for every adjective expresses not only an attribute, but also the connection between the attribute and its substance; whereas in the abstract noun, the attribute is considered as a substance unconnected with any other substance.\n\nIn the next place, it is to be observed, that the connection expressed by adjectives, like that expressed by of, is of a nature to general and indefinite, that the particular kind of connection must, in some languages, be inferred from our previous knowledge of the objects between which it subsists, or it will for ever remain unknown. This might be proved by a variety of examples, but will perhaps be sufficiently evident from the following. Color salubris signifies colour that indicates health; exercitium salubris, exercise that preserves health; victus salubris, food that improves health; medicina salubris, medicine that restores health. In all these examples the connection expressed by the adjective form of salubris is different; and though it may be known from previous experience, there is nothing in any of the expressions themselves by which it can be ascertained. Thus, adjectives are each significant of an attribute and connection; but the particular kind of connection is ascertained by experience.—The usual effect of adjectives in language, is to modify or particularise a general term, by adding some quality or circumstance which may distinguish the object meant by that term, from the other objects of the same species. I have occasion, for example, to speak of a particular man, of whose name I am ignorant. The word man is too general for my purpose, it being applicable to every individual of the human species. In what way then do I proceed, in order to particularise it, so as to make it denote that very man whom I mean to specify? I annex or conjoin to it such words as are significant of objects and qualities with which he is connected, and which are not equally applicable to others from whom I mean to distinguish him. Thus I can say, a man of prudence or a prudent man, a wife man, a good man, a brave man, &c. By these additions the general term man is limited, or modified, and can be applied only to certain men to whom belong the attributes expressed by the adjectives prudent, wife, good, and brave. If it be still too general for my purpose, I can add to it other qualities and circumstances, till I make it so particular as to be applicable to but one individual man in the universe.\n\nThis is the way in which adjectives are commonly used, but this is not the only way. Instead of being employed to modify a substantive, they sometimes appear as the principal words in the sentence, when the sole use of the substantive seems to be to modify the abstract noun, contained under the adjective to which that substantive is joined. In order to understand this, it will be necessary to attend to the following observations.\n\nIt may be laid down as a general proposition, that when any term or phrase is employed to denote a complex conception, the mind has a power of considering, in what order it pleases, the simple ideas of which the complex conception is composed. To illustrate this observation by an example: The word eques in Latin denotes a complex conception, of which the constituent simple ideas are those of a man and a horse; with this connection subsisting between them, that the man is conceived as on the back of the horse. In the use of this word, it is well known that the idea first in order, as being the adjective's principal subject of the proposition, is commonly the man on the back of the horse; but it is not so always, for the mind may consider the horse as the principal object. Thus when Virgil says,\n\nFrana Pelethronti Lapitho gyrosque dedere,\nImpofiri dorfo; atque equitem docere sub armis\nInsultare solo, et gressus glomerare superbos—\n\nthe energies attributed to the object signified by equitem, make it evident that the horse and not the man is meant; for it is not the property of a man, insultare solo, et gressus glomerare superbos.\n\nThe same observation holds true where the complex object is denoted by two or more words; an adjective, for instance, and a substantive. Thus in the phrase summum montis inter nubila condit, the words summum montis represent a complex conception, of which the constituent ideas are those of height and mountain, connected together by the adjective form of summum. Either of these ideas may be the subject of the proposition; and the expression will accordingly admit of two different significations. If montis be made the subject of the proposition, the meaning will be, \"the highest mountain hides itself among the clouds.\" If the substantive included in the radical part of summum be made the subject of the proposition, the expression will signify, \"the summit, or highest part of the mountain, hides itself among the clouds.\" The latter is the true import of the sentence.\n\nFrom these observations and examples, we shall be enabled to understand the two uses of the adjective of the adjective. It is either employed, as has been already observed, adjective to restrict or modify, a general term; or the abstract substantive contained in the adjective is modified by the noun, with which, in the concrete or adjective form, that abstract substantive is joined. The first may be called the direct, the second the inverse, acceptation of adjectives.\n\nThe inverse acceptation of adjectives and participles (for both are used in the same manner) has not, except in a very few instances, been noticed by any grammarians; yet the principle is of great extent in language. In order to explain it, we shall produce a few examples; which on any other principle it is impossible to understand.\n\nLivy, speaking of the abolition of the regal authority at Rome, says, Regnatum efl Romae ab urbe condita ad libertatem annos ducentos quadraginta quattuor, \"Monarchy subsisted at Rome, not from the city built (which would convey no meaning), but from the building of the city, to its deliverance,\" &c. Both the participles condita and liberata are here used inversely; that is, the abstract substantives contained in condita and liberata are modified or restricted by the substantives urbe and urbem, with which they unite. Again, Ovid, speaking of the contest between Ajax and Ulysses for the arms of Achilles, has these lines:\n\nQui, licet eloquio fidum quoque Nestora vincat,\nNaud tamen efficit, desertum ut Nestora crimen\nNullum effe rear.\n\nHere also the adjective or participle desertum is taken inversely, and the general notion of desertion contained in it is modified or rendered particular by being joined with the substantive Nestora. The meaning of the passage\nAdjectives, passage is, \"I will never be induced to believe that the derivation of Nestor was not a crime.\" Were defertive to be taken directly as an adjective modifying its substantive, the sentence must be translated, \"I cannot believe that Nestor defertive was not a crime.\" But it is evident that this is nonsense: as Nestor, whether defertive or not defertive, could not be a crime.\n\nIt were easy to produce many more examples of adjectives taken inversely; but these may suffice to illustrate the general principle, and to show, that without attending to it, it is impossible to understand the ancient authors. We shall adduce one instance of it from Shakespeare, to evince that it is not confined to the ancient languages, though in these it is certainly more frequent than in the modern:\n\n\"Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky;\nThou canst not bite so nigh\nAs benefits forgot:\nThough thou the waters warp,\nThy sting is not so sharp\nAs friends remember'd not.\"\n\nHere it is evident, that the adjective forgot is taken inversely; for it is not a benefit, but the forgetting of a benefit, which bites more than the bitter sky; and therefore, in this passage, the adjective serves not to modify the noun; but the noun benefits is employed to modify the abstract substantive contained in the adjective forgot, which is the subject of the proposition, and the principal word in the sentence.\n\nHad Mr Harris attended to this principle, and reflected upon what he could not but know, that all adjectives denote substances; not indeed subsisting by themselves, as those expressed by nouns, but concretely, as the attributes of other substances; he would not have clasped adjectives with verbs, or have passed so severe a censure upon the grammarians for clasping them with nouns. It matters very little how adjectives are clasped, provided their nature and effect be understood; but they have at least a title to be ranked with nouns as with verbs, and in our opinion a better. To adopt Mr Harris's language, they are homogeneous with respect to nouns, as both denote substances; they are heterogeneous with respect to verbs, as they never do denote affections.\n\nBesides original adjectives, there is another class, which is formed from substantives. Thus, when we say, the party of Pompey, the style of Cicero, the philosophy of Socrates; in these cases, the party, the style, and the philosophy spoken of, receive a stamp and character from the persons whom they respect: Those persons, therefore, perform the part of attributes. Hence they actually pass into attributives, and assume as such the form of adjectives. It is thus we say, the Pompeian party, the Ciceronian style, and the Socratic philosophy. In like manner, for a trumpet of brass, we say a brass trumpet, and for a crown of gold, a golden crown, &c. Even pronominal substantives admit the like mutation. Thus, instead of saying, the book of me, and of thee, we say my book, and thy book; and instead of saying, the country of us, and of you, we say our country, and your country. These words my, thy, our, your, &c., have therefore been properly called pronominal adjectives.\n\n88. It has been already observed, and must be obvious to all, that substances alone are susceptible of sex; and that therefore substantive nouns alone should have distinctions reflecting gender. The same is true with respect to number and person. An attribute admits of no change in its nature, whether it belong to you from their or to me, to a man or a woman, to one man or to nature many; and therefore the words expressive of attributes, should have no variation on all occasions, and in every situation, to be fixed and invariable. For as the qualities good and bad, hot and cold, black and white, are the same, whether they be applied number, or to a man or a woman, to many or to few; so the word person, which expresses any one of these attributes ought in strictness to admit of no alteration with whatever substantive it may be joined. Such is the order of nature; and that order, on this as on other occasions, the English language most strictly observes; for we say equally, a good man or a good woman; good men or good women; a good house or good houses. In some languages, indeed, such as Greek and Latin, of which the nouns admit of cases, and the sentences of an inverted structure, it has been found necessary to endow adjectives with the threefold distinction of gender, number, and person; but as this is only an accidental variation, occasioned by particular circumstances, and not in the least essential to language, it belongs not to our subject, but to the particular grammars of these tongues.\n\nThere is, however, one variation of the adjective, which has place in all languages, is founded in the nature of things, and properly belongs to universal grammar. It is occasioned by comparing the attributes of one substance with a similar attribute of another, and falls naturally to be explained under the next section.\n\nSect. III. Of Adverbs, and the Comparison of Adjectives.\n\n89. As adjectives denote the attributes of substances, so there is an inferior class of words which denote the modifications of these attributes. Thus, when we say \"Cicero and Pliny were both of them eloquent; Statius and Virgil both of them wrote;\" the attributes expressed by the words eloquent and wrote are immediately referred to Cicero, Virgil, &c.; and as denoting the attributes of substances, these words, the one an adjective, and the other a verb, have been both called attributives of the first order. But when we say, \"Pliny was moderately eloquent, but Cicero exceedingly eloquent; Statius wrote indifferently, but Virgil wrote admirably;\" the words moderately, exceedingly, indifferently, and admirably, are not referable to substantives, but to other attributes; that is, to the words eloquent and wrote, the significations of which they modify. Such words, therefore, having the same effect upon adjectives that adjectives have upon substantives, have been called attributives of the second order. By grammarians they have been called adverbs; and, if the reason we take the word verb in its most comprehensive signification (A), as including not only verbs properly so called, but also every species of words, which, whether essentially or accidentally, are significant of the attributes of substances, we shall find the name adverb to\n\n(A) Aristotle and his followers called every word a verb, which denotes the predicate of a proposition. This classification was certainly absurd; for it confounds not only adjectives and participles, but even substantives, with verbs; but the authority of Aristotle was great; and hence the name of adverb, though that word attaches itself only to an adjective or participle, or a verb significant of an attribute; it does not attach itself to the pure verb.\nto be a very just appellation, as denoting a part of speech, the natural appendage of such verbs. So great is this dependence in grammatical syntax, that an adverb can no more subsist without its verb, i.e., without some word significant of an attribute, than a verb or adjective can subsist without its substantive. It is the same here as in certain natural subjects. Every colour, for its existence, as much requires a superficies, as the superficies for its existence requires a solid body.\n\n90. Among the attributes of substances are reckoned quantity and quality; thus we say a white garment, a high mountain, &c. Now some of these quantities and qualities are capable of intension or remission; or, in other words, one substance may have them in a greater or less degree than another. Thus we say, a garment exceedingly white, a mountain tolerably or moderately high. Hence, then, one copious source of secondary attributive or adverbs to denote these two, that is, intension and remission; such as greatly, tolerably, vastly, extremely, indifferently, &c.\n\nBut where there are different intentions of the same attribute, they may be compared together: Thus, if the garment A be exceedingly white, and the garment B be moderately white, we may say, the garment A is more white than the garment B. This paper is white, and snow is white; but snow is more white than this paper. In these instances, the adverb more not only denotes intension, but relative intension: nay, we stop not here, as we not only denote intension merely relative, but relative intension than which there is none greater. Thus we say, Sophocles was wise, Socrates was more wise than he, but Solomon was the most wise of men. Even verbs properly so called, which denote an attribute as well as an afflatus, must admit both of simple and also of comparative intentions; but the simple verb to be admits of neither the one nor the other. Thus, in the following example, Fame he loveth more than riches; but virtue of all things he loveth most; the words more and most denote the different comparative intentions of the attribute included under the verb loveth; but the afflatus itself, which is the essential part of the verb, admits neither of intension nor remission, but is the same in all possible propositions.\n\n91. From this circumstance of quantities and qualities being capable of intension and remission, arise the comparison of adjectives, and its different degrees, which cannot well be more than the two species above mentioned; one to denote simple excess, and one to denote superlative. Were we indeed to introduce more degrees than these, we ought perhaps to introduce infinite, which is absurd. For why stop at a limited number, when in all subjects susceptible of intension, the intermediate excellences are in a manner infinite? Between the first simple white and the superlative whitest, there are infinite degrees of more white; and the same may be said of more great, more strong, more minute, &c. The doctrine of grammarians about three such degrees of comparison, which they call the positive, the comparative, and the superlative, must be absurd; both because in their positive there is no comparison at all, and because their superlative is a comparative as much as their comparative itself. Examples to evince this may be met with everywhere: Socrates was the most wise of all the Athenians; Homer was the most sublime of all poets, &c. In this sentence Socrates is evidently compared with the Adverbs, Athenians, and Homer with all other poets. Again, if it be said that Socrates was more wise than any other Athenian, but that Solomon was the most wise of men; is not a comparison of Solomon with mankind in general, as plainly implied in the last clause of the sentence, as a comparison of Socrates with the other Athenians in the first?\n\nBut if both imply comparison, it may be asked, in what consists the difference between the comparative and superlative? Does the superlative always express a greater excess than the comparative? No; for though Socrates was the most wise of the Athenians, yet is Solomon affirmed to have been more wise than he; so that here a higher superiority is denoted by the comparative more than by the superlative most. Is this then the difference between these two degrees, that the superlative implies a comparison of one with many, while the comparative implies only a comparison of one with one? No; this is not always the case neither. The Psalmist says, that \"he is wiser (or more wise) than all his teachers;\" where, though the comparative is used, there is a comparison of one with many. The real difference between these two degrees of comparison may be explained thus:\n\nWhen we use the superlative, it is in consequence of having compared individuals with the species to which they belong, or one or more species with the genus under which they are comprehended. Thus, Socrates was the most wise of the Athenians, and the Athenians were the most enlightened of ancient nations. In the first clause of this sentence, Socrates, although compared with the Athenians, is at the same time considered as one of them; and in the last, the Athenians, although compared with ancient nations, are yet considered as one of those nations. Hence it is that in English the superlative is followed by the preposition of, and in Greek and Latin by the genitive case of the plural number; to show, that the object which has the pre-eminence is considered as belonging to that class of things with which it is compared.\n\nBut when we use the comparative degree, the objects compared are set in direct opposition; and the one is considered not as a part of the other, or as comprehended under it, but as something altogether distinct and belonging to a different class. Thus, were one to say, \"Cicero was more eloquent than the Romans,\" he would speak absurdly; because every body knows, that of the class of men expressed by the word Romans Cicero was one, and such a sentence would affirm that orator to have been more eloquent than himself. But when it is said that \"Cicero was more eloquent than all the other Romans, or than any other Roman,\" the language is proper, and the affirmation true; for though the persons spoken of were all of the same class or city, yet Cicero is here set in contradiction to the rest of his countrymen, and is not considered as one of the persons with whom he is compared. It is for this reason that in English the comparative degree is followed by a noun governed by the word of contradiction than, and in Latin by a noun in the ablative case governed by the preposition praec (B) either expressed or understood. We have already observed, that the ablative case denotes concomitancy; and therefore when\n\n(B) See Ruddimanni Grammaticae Institutiones, Pars secunda, lib. i. cap. 2.\n\nAlthough it is certainly true, that when we use the superlative, we ought in propriety to consider the things\nChap. V.\n\nAn adjective in the comparative degree is prefixed to a noun, that noun is put in the ablative case, to denote that two things are compared together in comparison; but by means of the preposition, expressed or understood, that which is denoted by the comparative adjective is seen to be preferred before that which is denoted by the noun.\n\n92. We have hitherto considered comparatives as expressed by the words more and most; but the authors, or improvers of language, have contrived a method to retrench the use of these adverbs, by expressing their force by an inflection of the adjective. Thus, instead of more fair, they say fairer; instead of most fair, fairest; and the same method of comparison takes place both in the Greek and Latin languages; with this difference, however, between the genius of these languages and ours, that we are at liberty to form the comparison either in the one method or in the other; whereas in those languages the comparison is seldom if ever formed by the affluence of the adverb, but always by the inflection of the adjective. Hence this inflection is by the Greek and Latin grammarians considered as a necessary accident of the adjective; but it has reached no farther than to adjectives, and participles sharing the nature of adjectives. The attributes expressed by verbs are as susceptible of comparison as those expressed by adjectives; but they are always compared by means of adverbs, the verb being too much diversified already to admit of more variations without perplexity.\n\n93. It must be confessed that comparatives, as well as the simple as the superlative, seem sometimes to part with their relative nature, and to retain only their intensive. Thus in the degree denoting simple excess:\n\nTristior, et lacrymis oculos suffusa nitentis. Virg.\n\nTristior means nothing more than that Venus was very sad. In the degree called the superlative this is more usual. Phrases extremely common are, Vir doctissimus, vir fortissimus, \"a most learned man, a most brave man;\" i.e., not the bravest and most learned man that ever existed, but a man possessing those qualities in an eminent degree. In English, when we intimate that a certain quality is possessed in an eminent degree, without making any direct comparison between it and a similar quality, we do it by the intensive word very, more commonly than by most: as, Cicero was very eloquent; the mind of Johnson was very vigorous. This mode of expression has been called the superlative of eminence, to distinguish it from the other superlative, which is superlative upon comparison. Yet it may be said, that even in the superlative of eminence something of comparison must be remotely or indirectly intimated, as we cannot reasonably call a man very eloquent without comparing his eloquence with the eloquence of other men. This is indeed true; but we cannot therefore affirm that comparison is more clearly intimated in this superlative than in the simple adjective eloquent: for when we say that a man is eloquent, we mark between his eloquence and that of other men a distinction of the same kind, though not in the same degree, as when we say that he is very eloquent.\n\nIn English we distinguish the two superlatives, by prefixing to the one the definite article the, to show that something is predicated of the object expressed by it, which cannot be predicated of any other object; and by subjoining the preposition of, to show that the objects with which it is compared are of the same class with itself; as, \"Solomon was the wisest of men; Hector was the most valiant of the Trojans.\" To the other (c) superlative we only prefix the indefinite article a: as, \"he was a very good man: he was a most valiant folder.\"\n\n94. As there are some qualities which admit of comparison, so there are others which admit of none: such, for example, are those which denote that quality of bodies arising from their figure; as when we say, a circular compassable, a quadrangular court, a conical piece of metal, &c. The reason is, that a million of things participating the same figure, participate it equally, if they do it at all. To say, therefore that while A and B are both quadrangular, A is more or less quadrangular than B, is absurd. The same holds true in all attributives denoting definite quantities of whatever nature: for as there can be no comparison without intensification, and as there can be no intensification or remission in things always definite, therefore these attributives can admit of no comparison. By the same method of reasoning, we discover the cause why no substantive is susceptible of these degrees of comparison. A mountain cannot be said more to be or to exist than a mole-hill; but the more or less must be sought for in their quantities. In like manner, when we refer many individuals to one species, the lion A cannot be called more a lion than the lion B (D); but if more anything, he is more fierce, more swift, or exceeding in some such attribute. So again, in referring many species to one genus, a crocodile is not more an animal than a lizard; nor a tiger more than a cat; but, if anything, the crocodile and tiger are more bulky, more strong, &c., than the animals with which they are compared; the excess, as before, being derived from their attributes.\n\n(c) In English, the termination est is peculiar to the superlative of comparison, to which the definite article is prefixed. Thus we may say, \"Homer was the sublimest of poets;\" but we cannot say, \"Homer was a sublime poet.\" Again, we may say, \"Homer was a very sublime poet;\" but not, \"Homer was the very sublime poet.\"\n\n(d) When Pope says of a certain person, that he is \"a tradesman, meek, and much a liar;\" the last phrase is the same with much given to lying, the word liar having the effect of an attributive.\n95. Of the adverbs or secondary attributes already mentioned, those denoting intensity and remission may be called **adverbs of quantity continuous**, as greatly, vastly, tolerably, &c.; once, twice, thrice, &c. (E) are **adverbs of quantity discrete**; more and most, less and least, to which may be added equally, proportionally, &c., are **adverbs of relation**. There are others of **quality**: as when we say, honestly industrious, prudently brave; they fought bravely, he painted finely.\n\nAnd here it may be worth while to observe, how the same thing, participating the same essence, assumes different grammatical forms from its different relations. For example, suppose it should be asked, How differ honest, honestly, and honesty? The answer is, They are in essence the same; but they differ in as much as honesty is the attributive of a noun; honestly, of verb or adjective; and honesty being divested of these its attributive relations, assumes the power of a noun or substantive, so as to stand by itself.\n\n96. The adverbs hitherto mentioned are common to verbs of every species; but there are some which are confined to verbs properly so called, that is, to such verbs as denote motions or energies with their privations. All motion and rest imply time and place as a kind of necessary coincidence. Hence, when we would express the place or time of either, we have recourse to adverbs formed for this purpose; of place, as when we say, he stood there, he went hence, he came thither; of time, as when we say, he stood then, he went afterwards, he travelled formerly. To these may be added the adverbs which denote the intensities and remissions peculiar to motion, such as speedily, hastily, swiftly, slowly, &c.; as also adverbs of place made out of prepositions, such as upward and downward from up and down. It may, however, be doubted whether some of these words, as well as many others, which do not so properly modify attributes, as mark some remote circumstance attending an attribute or our way of conceiving it, are truly adverbs, though so called by the grammarians. The simple affirmative and negative yes and no are called adverbs, though they surely do not signify that which we hold to be the very essence of the adverb, a modification of attributes. \"Is he learned? No.\" \"Is he brave? Yes.\" Here the two adverbs, as they are called, signify not any modification of the attributes brave and learned, but a total negation of the attribute in the one case, and in the other a declaration that the attribute belongs to the person spoken of.\n\nAdverbs are indeed applied to many purposes; and their general nature may be better understood by reading a list of them, and attending to their etymology, than by any general description or definition. Many of them seem to have been introduced into language in order to express by one word the meaning of two or three; and are mere abbreviations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Thus, the import of the phrase, in what place, is expressed by the single word where; to what place, by whither; from this place, by hence; in a direction ascending, by upwards; at the present time, by now; at what time, by when; at that time, by then; many times, by often; not many times, by seldom, &c.\n\n(E) These words were anciently written one's, twie's, thrie's; and are merely the genitives of one, two, three, the substantive time or turn being omitted. Thus, How often did you write? Answer, Once, i.e., one's time. See Horne Tooke's Diversions of Purley.\n\n97. Mr Horne Tooke has, with great industry and accuracy, traced many of the English adverbs from their origin in the ancient Saxon and other northern tongues, and shown them to be either corruptions of other words or abbreviations of phrases and sentences. He observes, \"that all adverbs ending in ly, the most prolific branch of the family, are insufficiently understood; the termination being only the word like corrupted; and the corruption so much the more easily and certainly discovered, as the termination remains more pure and distinguishable in the other fifteen languages, in which it is written lick, lyk, lig, ligen.\" He might have added, that in Scotland the word like is, at this day, frequently used instead of the English termination ly; as for a goodly figure, the common people say a good-like figure. Upon this principle the greater part of adverbs are resolved into those parts of speech which we have already considered, as honestly into honest-like, vastly into vast-like, &c. So that when we say of a man he is honestly industrious, we affirm that he is honest-like industrious, or that his industry has the appearance of being honest. Adverbs of a different termination the same acute writer resolves thus; AGHAST into the past participle AGAZED;\n\n\"The French exclaimed,—the devil was in arms.\"\n\n\"All the whole army flood agazed on him?\" Shakesp.\n\nAgo, into the past participle AGONE or GONE. Asunder he derives from ASUNDRID, separated; the past participle of the Anglo-Saxon verb afundrian: a word which, in all its varieties, is to be found, he says, in all the northern tongues; and is originally from fond, i.e. fond. To wit, from wittan to know; as videlicet and seidicet, in Latin, are abbreviations of videre-licet and seire-licet. Needs, he resolves into NEED IS, used parenthetically; as, \"I must needs do such a thing;\"—i.e., \"I must (need is) do such a thing;\" i.e., \"I must do it, there is need of it.\" Anon, which our old authors use for immediately, instantly, means, he says, in one; i.e., in one instant, moment, minute. As,\n\n\"And right anon withouten more abode.\"\n\n\"Anon in all the haste I can.\"\n\nALONE and ONLY are resolved into ALL ONE, and ONE-LIKE. In the Dutch, EEN is one; and ALL EEN alone; and ALL-EEN-LIKE, only, anciently aloneonly. ALIVE is on live, or in life. Thus,\n\n\"Christ eterne on live,\" Chaucer.\n\nAUGHT or OUGHT; A WHIT or O WHIT; o being formerly written for the article A, or for the numeral ONE; and whit or hwit, in Saxon, signifying a small thing, a point or jot. AWHELLE, which is usually clasped with adverbs; a while, i.e., a time. Whilst, anciently and more properly WHILES, is plainly the Saxon HWILE-ES, time that. ALOFT was formerly written ON-LOFT:\n\n\"As,\n\n\"And ye, my mother, my sovereigne pleasance\n\n\"Over al thing, out take Christ on lofte.\" Chaucer.\n\nNow, says Mr Horne Tooke, lyft, in the Anglo Saxon,\nChap. VI.\n\nGRAMMAR.\n\nVerbs. is the air or the clouds, as in LYFT, CUMMENDE, coming in the clouds (St Luke). In the Danish, LUFT is air; and \"at spronge i luften,\" to blow up into the air, or ALFOT. So in the Dutch, de loef hebben, to fail before the wind; LOVEN, to ply to windward; LOOF, the weather page, &c. From the same root are our other words; Loft, lofty, to luff, lee, leeward, lift, &c. It would be needless, as the ingenious author observes, to notice such adverbs as, aflood, adays, abore, afraze, afloze, aright, abed, aback, abraze, aflood, aloud, afide, afield, aground, aland, &c. These are at first view seen for what they are. Nor shall we follow him through the analysis which he has given of many other adverbs, of which the origin is not so obvious as of these. Of the truth of his principles we are satisfied; and have not a doubt, but that upon those principles a man conversant with our earliest writers, and thoroughly skilled in the present languages, may trace every English (s) adverb to its source, and show that it is no part of speech separate from those which we have already considered. The adverbs, however, of affirmation and negation, are of too much importance to be thus passed over; and as we have never seen an account of them at all satisfactory, except that which has been given by Horne Tooke, we shall transcribe the substance of what he says concerning AYE, YEA, YES, and NO. To us these words have always appeared improperly clasped with adverbs upon every definition which has been given of that part of speech. Accordingly, our author says, that AYE or YEA is the imperative of a verb of northern extraction; and means, have, possess, enjoy. And YES is a contraction of AY-ES, have, possess, enjoy, that. Thus, when it is asked whether a man be learned, if the answer be by the word YES, it is equivalent to have that, enjoy that, belief or that proposition. (See what was said of the nature of interrogation, Chap. IV. No 76.)\n\nThe northern verb of which YEA is the imperative, is in Danish EJER, to possess, have, enjoy. EJA, eye or yea; EJE, possession; EJER, possessor. In Swedish it is EGA, to possess; of which the imperative is JA, eye, yea; EGARE, possessor. In German, JA signifies eye, or yea; EIGENER, possessor, owner; EIGEN, own. In Dutch, EIGENEN is to possess; JA, yea.\n\nGreenwood derives NOT and its abbreviation NO from the Latin; Minshew, from the Hebrew; and Junius, from the Greek. Our author very properly observes, that the inhabitants of the north could not wait for a word expressive of dissent till the establishment of these nations and languages; and adds, that we need not be inquisitive nor doubtful concerning the origin and signification of NOT and NO; since we find that, in the Danish, NODIG, in the Swedish NODIG, and in the Dutch, NOODE, NODE, and NO, mean averse, unwilling. So that when it is asked whether a man be brave, if the answer be NO, it is a declaration that he who makes it is averse from or unwilling to admit that proposition.\n\n98. Most writers on grammar have mentioned a species of adverbs, which they call adverbs of interrogation, such as where, whence, whither, how, &c. But the truth is, that there is no part of speech, which, of itself, denotes interrogation. A question is never asked otherwise than by abbreviation, by a single word, whether that word be a noun, a pronoun, a verb, or an adverb. The word WHERE is equivalent to—in what place; WHENCE to—from what place; and HOW—to—in what manner, &c. In these phrases, IN WHAT PLACE, FROM WHAT PLACE, AND IN WHAT MANNER, the only word that can be supposed to have the force of an interrogative, is what, which is resolvable into that which: But we have already explained, in the chapter of Pronouns, the principles upon which the relative is made to denote interrogation, and the same reasoning will account for the adverbs where, whence, whither, how, &c. being employed as interrogatives. When we say, where were you yesterday? whence have you come? whither are you going? how do you perform your journey? We merely use many abbreviations for the following sentences; tell us, or describe to us, THE PLACE where (or in which) you were yesterday; THE PLACE whence (or from which) you have come; THE PLACE to which you are going; THE MANNER in which you perform your journey? And so much for adverbs. We now proceed to those parts of speech which are usually called prepositions and conjunctions, and of which the use is to connect the other words of a sentence, and to combine two or more simple sentences into one compound sentence.\n\nCHAP. VI. Of Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections.\n\n99. It has been observed, that a man while awake is conscious of a continued train of perceptions and ideas passing in his mind, which depends little upon his own will; that he cannot to the train add a new idea; and that he can but very seldom break its connexion. To the slightest reflection these truths must be apparent. Our first ideas are those which we derive from external objects making impressions on the senses; but all the external objects which fall under our observation are linked together in such a manner as indicates them to be parts of one great and regular system.\n\n(s) The same resolution might probably be made of the Greek and Latin adverbs, were we as intimately acquainted with the sources of those tongues as Mr Horne Tooke is with the sources of the English language. Many of the Latin adverbs (says the learned Ruddiman) are nothing else but adjective nouns or pronouns, having the preposition and substantive understood; as, quo, eo, eodem, for ad quem, ea, eadem (loci) or cui, ei, eisdem (loci); for of old these datives ended in o. Thus, qua, hac, illac, &c. are plainly adjectives in the abl. sing. femin. the word via, \"a way,\" and the preposition in, being understood. Many of them are compounds; as, quonodo, i.e. quo modo; quamodumodum, i.e. ad quem modum; quamobrem, i.e. ob quam rem; quare, i.e. (pro) quare; quorquam, i.e. quibus quem (locum); feliciter, i.e. se ferre licet; videlicet, i.e. vide licet; illicet, i.e. ire licet; illicio, i.e. in loco; magnopere, i.e. magna opere; nimium, i.e. ni (e) mirum; hodie, i.e. hoc die; postdie, i.e. postero die; pridie, i.e. praedie. Profecto, certe, sane, male, bene, plane, are obviously adjectives. Forte is the ablative of fors; and if we had leisure to pursue the subject, and were masters of all the languages from which the Latin is derived, we doubt not but we should be able to resolve every adverb into a substantive or adjective.\nIn English, however, the case is otherwise; for were we to say, \"He rode Edinburgh, went the parliament-house, walked his counsel till the court met,\" we should speak unintelligibly; as in these expressions there is either a total want of connexion, or such a connection as produces falsehood and nonsense. In order to give meaning to the passage, the several gaps must be filled up by words significant of the various relations by which the different ideas are connected in the mind; as, \"He rode to Edinburgh, went to the parliament-house, and walked with his counsel till the court met.\" By prepositions, and with are called prepositions and conjunctions, and till are usually called conjunctions.\n\nAlthough these prepositions and conjunctions are not absolutely necessary in Greek and Latin as they are in English; yet as there is no language wholly without them, nor any language in which it is not of importance to understand their force, they well deserve a place in universal grammar.\n\n100. The sole use of conjunctions and prepositions in language is to connect either sentences or other words; but the theory of these connectives themselves has certainly never been understood, unless Horne Tooke has words at last hit upon the truth. Mr Harris writes about them and about them, quoting passages from Greek and Latin authors, and produces at last no information. His definitions of both, as parts of speech void of signification, are highly absurd; and even the principal distinction which he makes between them seems not to be well founded. Prepositions and conjunctions denote the relations subsisting between the ideas expressed by those words or sentences which they serve to connect; and as relations are contemplated by the mind as well as positive ideas themselves, the words which denote those relations cannot be insignificant. The essential difference between the conjunction and preposition, according to the same author, consists in this, that the former connects sentences, and the latter words; but the fact is often otherwise. An obvious example occurs where the conjunction and connects not sentences but words. \"A man of wisdom and virtue is a perfect character.\" Here it is not meant to be asserted, \"that the man of wisdom is a perfect character, and that the man of virtue is a perfect character:\" both these assertions would be false. This sentence therefore (and many such will occur) is not resolvable into two; whence it follows, that the conjunction and does not always connect sentences; and the same is frequently the case with other conjunctions.\n\nHorne Tooke's idea of prepositions and conjunctions is, that they do not form distinct classes of words, but are merely abbreviations of nouns and verbs: and with respect to the English language, he has been remarkably successful in proving his position. But though such be undeniably the case in English, it would be rash to conclude a priori that it is so in all other tongues. To establish this general conclusion would require a long and tedious deduction in each particular language: and how much learning, leisure, industry, and acuteness, such an undertaking would require, even in one tongue, it is not easy to determine. In the languages with which we are best acquainted, many conjunctions, and most prepositions, have the appearance at least of original words; and though this most acute grammarian, from his knowledge of the northern tongues, has been able to trace the most important of those in English to very\nvery plausible sources, the same thing would be difficult in other languages of which the sources are obscure, and absolutely impossible in those of which they are wholly unknown. It is, however, a strong presumption in favour of his opinion, that grammarians have never been able to assign any general characteristic of those species of words; which, did they constitute distinct parts of speech, one would think could not have so long remained undiscovered. It is a farther presumption in his favour, that many words in Greek and Latin, as well as in English, which have been called conjunctions, are obviously resolvable upon his principles, and indeed discover their meaning and origin upon mere inspection. We shall therefore content ourselves with retailing the common doctrine respecting these parts of speech so far as it is intelligible; subjoining at the bottom of the page the analysis given by Horne Tooke of the most important English conjunctions and prepositions; and requesting our readers, who would understand the subject, to attend more to the relations between their various ideas, than to the frivolous distinctions which, in compliance with custom, we are compelled to lay before them. We shall treat first of the conjunction.\n\nSect. I. Of Conjunctions.\n\n101. A conjunction is a part of speech of which, as its name indicates, the use is to connect either two or more words in a sentence, or to make of two simple sentences one compound sentence. It is usually said, that conjunctions never connect words, but sentences only, and that this is the circumstance which distinguishes them from prepositions. We have already given one example which proves this distinction to be ill founded; we shall now give from Horne Tooke one or two more, which will place its absurdity in a still clearer light: Two and two are four; John and Jane are a handsome couple; AB and BC and CA form a triangle. Are two four? Is John a couple and Jane a couple? Does one straight line form a triangle? From the subjoined note it appears, that AND (g) may connect any two things which can be connected, as it signifies addition.\n\nConjunctions connecting sentences, sometimes connect their meaning, and sometimes not. For example, let us take these two sentences, Rome was enslaved, Caesar was ambitious, and connect them together by the conjunction BECAUSE; Rome was enslaved BECAUSE Caesar was ambitious. Here the meanings, as well as the sentences, appear to be connected by that natural relation which subsists between an effect and its cause; for the enslaving of Rome was the effect of Caesar's ambition. That particular relation therefore is that which is denoted by the conjunction BECAUSE (h), which would be improperly used to connect two sentences between which the relation of an effect to its cause exists not. But if it be said, manners must be reformed, or liberty will be lost; here the conjunction OR, though it join the sentences, yet as to their meaning is a perfect disjunctive. Between the reformation of manners and the loss of liberty there is certainly a natural relation; but it is not the relation of contiguity or similitude, or of cause and effect, but of contrariety. The relation of contrariety therefore is the signification of the word OR (i). And thus it appears, that though all conjunctions may combine sentences, yet, with respect to the senses, some are conjunctive and others are disjunctive.\n\n102. Those conjunctions which conjoin both sentences and their meanings are either copulative or continuative. The principal copulative in English is AND, which we have already considered. The continuatives are much more numerous; IF, AN, BECAUSE, THEREFORE, WHEREFORE, HENCE, &c. The difference between them is this: The copulative does no more than barely couple words or sentences, and is therefore applicable to all subjects of which the natures are not incompatible (k). The relation which it denotes is that of juxtaposition, or of one thing added to another. Continuatives, on the contrary, by a more intimate connection, consolidate sentences into one continuous whole; and are therefore applicable only to subjects which have an essential relation to each other, such as that of an effect to its cause or of a cause to its effect. For example, it is no way improper to say, Lyhippus was a flatuary, and Priscian a grammarian; the sun shineth, and the sky is clear; because these are things that may coexist, and yet imply no absurdity. But it would be absurd to say, Lyhippus was a flatuary BECAUSE Priscian was a grammarian; though not to say, the sun shineth BECAUSE the sky is clear. With respect to the first, the reason is, that the word BECAUSE denotes the relation which an effect bears to its cause: but the skill of Priscian in grammar could not possibly be the cause of Lyhippus's skill in flatuary; the coincidence between the skill of the one and that of the other, in arts so very different, was merely accidental. With respect to the shining of the sun and the clearness of the sky, the case is widely different; for the clearness of the sky is the cause of the sun's shining, at least so as to be seen by us.\n\nAs to the continuatives, they are either suppositive, such as if, an; or positive, such as because, therefore, as, &c. Take examples of each: You will live happily IF you live honestly; you live happily BECAUSE you live honestly; you live honestly, THEREFORE you live happily. The difference between these continuatives is this: The suppositives denote connection, but do not assert actual existence:\n\n(g) AND is a Saxon word, being (according to Mr H. Tooke) an abbreviation of ANAD, the imperative of the verb ANANAD, to add to or heap up. So that when we say two AND two are four, we only declare that two added to two are four.\n\n(h) BECAUSE is compounded of the Saxon BE—by, and cause; and by some of our most ancient authors it was written BY CAUSE. Rome was enslaved BECAUSE Caesar was ambitious, is therefore equivalent to, Rome was enslaved by the cause Caesar was ambitious; taking the phrase, Caesar was ambitious as an abstract noun in concord with the other noun cause.\n\n(i) OR seems to be a mere contraction of the Saxon ODER, which signifies other, i.e. something different and often contrary. So that the conjunction OR must always denote diversity, and very often contrariety.\n\n(k) As day and night, heat and cold: for we cannot say of the same portion of time, it is day AND it is night; or of the same body, it is both hot AND cold.\nThe positives above mentioned are either causal; such as, because, since, as (m), &c.; or collective; such as, therefore, wherefore, &c. The difference between these is this: The causals subjoin causes to effects; as, the sun is in eclipse, because the moon intervenes; the collectives subjoin effects to causes; as, the moon intervenes, therefore.\n\n(1.) The reason of all this will be apparent from the analysis given by Horne Tooke of those words which we have called suppositive conjunctions. If and an may be used mutually and indifferently to supply each other's place; for they are both verbs, and of the same import. If is merely the imperative of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon verb gifan, to give; and in those languages, as well as in the English formerly, this supposed conjunction was pronounced and written as the common imperative gif. Thus,\n\n\"My lassie,\nHath lotted her to be your brother's mistress,\nGif fleec can be reclaimed; gif not, his prey.\"\n\nSad Shepherd, Act ii. scene i.\n\nGavin Douglas almost always uses gif for if, as the common people in some counties of Scotland do even at this day; and it is obvious, that our if has always the signification of the English imperative give, and no other. So that the resolution of the construction in the sentence, if you live honestly you will live happily, is simply this, give you live honestly (taking you live honestly as an abstract noun) you will live happily. Your living happily is declared to depend upon your living honestly as the condition; but give that, and your happiness is positively asserted. In like manner may such sentences be resolved as,\n\n\"I wonder he can move! that he's not fixed!\nIf that his feelings be the same with mine.\"\n\nThus, \"His feelings be the same with mine, give that, I wonder he can move,\" &c. And here we cannot forbear giving our assent to the truth of Mr Tooke's observation, that when the datum upon which any conclusion depends is a sentence, the article that, if not expressed, may always be inserted. We do not, however, think the insertion at all times absolutely necessary to complete the syntax; for active verbs govern whole sentences and clauses of sentences as well as substantive nouns. Instances of this occur so frequently in the Latin classics, that they can have escaped no man's notice who has ever read Horace or Virgil with attention. We agree likewise with our most ingenious author, that where the datum is not a sentence, but some noun governed by the verb if or give, the article that can never be inserted. For example, if we be asked, how the weather will dispose of us to morrow? we cannot say: If that fair, it will send us abroad; if that foul, it will keep us at home;\" but \"if fair, it will send us abroad,\" &c. The reason is obvious: the verb in this case directly governs the noun; and the resolved construction is, \"give fair weather, it will send us abroad; give foul weather, it will keep us at home.\"\n\nAn, the other suppositive conjunction mentioned, is nothing else than the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb anan, which likewise means to give or to grant. As, \"An you had an eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you?\" that is, \"Grant you had an eye behind you, you might see,\" &c.\n\nThis account of the two conditional conjunctions in English is so rational and satisfactory, that we are strongly inclined to believe that all those words which are so called, are in all languages to be accounted for in the same manner: Not indeed that they must all mean precisely to give or grant, but some word equivalent; such as, be it, suppose, allow, permit, &c.; which meaning is to be sought for in the particular etymology of each respective language.\n\n(m) Of the causal conjunctions mentioned in the text, because has been already considered; and some account must be now given of the two words since and as. The former of these, according to Mr H. Tooke, is a very corrupt abbreviation, confounding together different words and different combinations of words. To us it appears to be compounded of seand, seeing; and es, that or it; or of sin, seen, and es. Seand and sin are the present and past participles of the Anglo-Saxon verb seon, to see. In modern English since is used four ways; two as a preposition affecting words, and two as a conjunction affecting sentences. When used as a preposition, it has always the signification of the past participle seen joined to thence (i.e., seen and thenceforward), or else the signification of the past participle seen only. When used as a conjunction, it has sometimes the signification of the present participle seeing, or seeing that; and sometimes the signification of the past participle seen, or seen that. We shall give examples of all these significations. 1st, As a preposition signifying seen and thenceforward: \"A more amiable sovereign than George III. has not swayed the English sceptre since the conquest.\" That is, \"The conquest seen (or at the completion of the fight of the conquest), and thenceforward, a more amiable sovereign than George III. has not swayed the English sceptre.\" Since, taken in this sense, seems rather to be a corruption of siththan or sithence, than a compound of seand and es. 2ndly, As a preposition signifying seen simply: Did George III. reign before or since that example? 3rdly, As a conjunction, since means seeing that: as, \"If I should labour for any other satisfaction but that of my own mind, it would be an effect of phrenzy in me, not of hope; since (or seeing that) it is not truth but opinion that can travel through the world without a passport.\" 4thly, It means seen that or that seen; as, \"Since death in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one, it were a foolish madness in the shipwreck of worldly things, when all sinks but the sorrow, to save that;\" i.e.—\"Death in the end takes from all whatsoever fortune or force takes from any one; that seen, it were a foolish madness,\" &c.\n\nAs, the other causal conjunction mentioned in the text, is an article meaning always it, or that, or which. Take the following example:\n\n\"She glides away under the foamy seas\nAs swift as darts or feather'd arrows fly.\"\n\nThat\nTherefore (n) the sun is in eclipse. We therefore use causals in those instances where, the effect being conspicuous, we seek its cause; and collectives, in demonstration and science, properly so called, where the cause being first known, by its help we deduce effects.\n\nAs to causal conjunctions, we may further observe, that there is no one of the four species of causes which they are not capable of denoting. For example, the material cause; The trumpet sounds because it is made of metal. The formal; The trumpet sounds because it is long and hollow. The efficient; The trumpet sounds because an artist blows it. The final; The trumpet sounds that it may raise our courage. It is worth observing, that the three first causes are expressed by the strongest affirmation; because if the effect actually be, these must be also. But this is not the case with respect to the last, which is only affirmed as a thing that may happen. The reason is obvious; for whatever may be the end which set the artist first to work, that end it may still be beyond his power to obtain; as, like all other contingents, it may either happen or not. Hence also it is connected by a particular conjunction, that (o), absolutely confined to this cause.\n\n103. We come now to the disjunctive conjunctions; a species of words which bear this contradictory name, because while they conjoin the sentences, they disjoin the sense; or, to speak a language more intelligible, they denote relations of diversity or opposition.\n\nThat there should be such words, whether called conjunctions or not, is extremely natural. For as there is a principle of union diffused through all things, by which this whole is kept together and preserved from dissipation; so is there in like manner a principle of diversity diffused through all, the source of distinction, of number, and of order. Now it is to express in some degree the modifications of this diversity, that those called disjunctive conjunctions are employed.\n\nOf these disjunctives some are simple and some ad- either affirmative: Simple; as when we say, either it is day or night; Adversative; as when we say, it is not day nor is it night. The difference between these is, that the simple expresses nothing more than a relation of diversity; the adversative expresses a relation not barely of diversity, but also of opposition. Add to this, that the adversatives are definite, the simple indefinite. Thus when we say, the number three is not an even number but (p) an odd, we not only disjoin two opposite attributes, but we definitely affirm the one to belong to the\n\nThat is, \"She glides away (with) that swiftness (with) which darts or feathered arrows fly.\" In German, where as still retains original signification and use, it is written es. So is another conjunction of the same import with as, being evidently the Gothic article sa or so, which signifies it or that.\n\n(n) As Mr Harris has called therefore, wherefore, &c. collective conjunctions, we have retained the denomination, though perhaps a more proper might be found. It is indeed of little consequence by what name any class of words be called, provided the import of the words themselves be understood. Wherefore and therefore evidently denote the relation of a cause to its effects. They are compounds of the Saxon words hwer and ther with for, or voor; and signify, for which, for those, or that. It is worthy of remark, that in some parts of Scotland the common people even at this day use thir for these.\n\n(o) We have already considered the word that, and seen that it is never a conjunction, but uniformly a definite article. \"The trumpet sounds (for) that it may raise our courage;\" taking the clause it may raise our courage as an abstract noun in concord with that and governed by for. Or the sentence may be resolved thus: \"The trumpet may raise our courage (for) that (purpose) it finds.\"\n\n(p) Mr Home Tooke has favoured us with some ingenious remarks on the two different derivations of the word but, when used in the two acceptations that are usually annexed to it, viz. that which it bears in the beginning of a sentence, and that which it has in the middle. He has given it as his opinion, that this word, when employed in the former way, is corruptly put for not, the imperative of the Saxon verb botan, to boat, to superadd, to supply, &c. and that when used in the latter it is a contraction of be-utan, the imperative of beonutan, to be out. Our ancient writers made the proper distinction between the orthography of the one word and that of the other. Gawin Douglas, in particular, although he frequently confounds the two words, and uses them improperly, does yet abound with many instances of their proper use; and so contrasted, as to awaken, says our author, the most inattentive reader. Of the many examples quoted by him, we shall content ourselves with the two following:\n\n\"But thy worke shall endure in laude and glorie,\n\"But spot or fault condigne eterne memorie.\"\n\"But gif the fates, but pleid,\n\"At my pleasure suffer it me life to leid.\"\n\nIf this derivation of the word but from botan, to superadd, be just, the sentence in the text, \"the number three is not an even number but an odd,\" will be equivalent to, \"the number three is not an even number, superadd (it is) an odd number;\" and if so, the opposition is not marked (at least directly) by the word but, but by the adjectives even and odd, which denote attributes in their own nature opposite. It is only when but has this sense that it answers to sed in Latin, or to mais in French. In the second line of the quotation from Gawin Douglas's Preface, the word but is evidently a contraction of be-utan, and has a sense very different from that of nor in the preceding line. The meaning of the couplet is, \"Superadd (to something said or supposed to be said before) thy work shall endure in laude and glorie, be out (i.e. without) spot or fault,\" &c. In the following passage from Donne, the word but, although written in the same manner, is used in both its meanings: \"You must answer, that she was brought very near the fire, and as good as thrown in; or else, that she was provoked to it by a divine inspiration. But that another divine inspiration moved the beholders to believe that she did therein a noble act, this act of her's might have been calumniated.\"\nthe subject, and deny the other. But when we say, the number of the stars is either (q) even or odd; though we assert one attribute to be, and the other not to be, yet the alternative is notwithstanding left indefinite.\n\nAs to adverbial disjunctives, it has been already said, after Mr Harris, that they imply opposition: but the truth seems to be, that they only unite in the same sentence words or phrases of opposite meanings. Now it is obvious, that opposite attributes cannot belong to the same subject; as when we say, Nereus was beautiful, we cannot superadd to this sentence, that he was ugly; we cannot say, he was beautiful, but ugly. When there is opposition, it must be either of the same attribute in different subjects; as when we say, \"Brutus was a patriot, but Caesar was not;\" Or of different attributes in the same subject; as when we say Gorgias was a sophist, but not a philosopher.\" Or of different attributes in different subjects; as when we say, \"Plato was a philosopher, but Hippas was a sophist.\"\n\nThe conjunctions used for all these purposes have been called absolute adverbials, we think improperly, as the opposition is not marked by the conjunctions, but by the words or sentences which they serve to connect. Mr Locke, speaking of the word but, says, that \"it sometimes intimates a stop of the mind, in the course it was going, before it came to the end of it:\" to which Mr Tooke replies with truth, that but itself is the farthest of any word in the language from intimating a stop. On the contrary, it always intimates something to follow; inasmuch, that when any man in discourse finishes his words with but, instead of supposing him to have stopped, we always ask, but what?\n\nBesides the adverbials already mentioned, there are two other species, of which the most important are un-\n\nless and although. For example, \"Troy will be taken, unless the palladium be preserved; Troy will be taken, although Hector defend it.\" The nature of these adverbials may be thus explained. As every event is naturally allied to its cause, so by parity of reason it is opposed to its preventive; and as every cause is either adequate or inadequate (inadequate when it endeavours without being effectual), so in like manner is every preventive. Now adequate preventives are expressed by such adverbials as unless; \"Troy will be taken, unless the palladium be preferred;\" that is, this alone is sufficient to prevent it. The inadequate are expressed by such adverbials as although; \"Troy will be taken although Hector defend it;\" that is, Hector's defence will prove ineffectual. These may be called adverbials adequate and inadequate.\n\nSuch is the doctrine of Mr Harris; which although we can discover in it no determinate meaning, we have ventured with others to retail, in respect to our readers, who may be more perspicacious than ourselves. The author was a man of great learning; and the subject, as he has treated it, appears to be intricate. But whatever sense or nonsense there may be in what he says of causes and preventives adequate and inadequate, we have no hesitation to affirm that he has totally mistaken the import of the words unless and although. From these being called both preventives, the one adequate and the other inadequate, an unwary reader might be led to infer, that they denote the same idea or the same relation; and that the whole difference between them is, that the expression of the one is more forcible than that of the other. Nothing, however, can be farther than this from the truth. The meaning of unless is directly opposite to that of although. Unless (r) and though\n\n(q) Either is nothing more than a distributive pronoun, which every body understands; and or we have already explained.\n\n(r) So low down as in the reign of Queen Elizabeth (says Horne Tooke) this conjunction was sometimes written onelles or onellef; but more anciently it was written onles and sometimes onlesse. Thus, in the trial of Sir John Oldcastle in 1413, \"It was not possible for them to make whole Christ's cote without feme, onlesse certeyn great men were brought out of the way.\" So, in \"The image of governance,\" by Sir T. Eliot, 1541, \"Men do fere to approache unto their sovereigne Lord, onelles they be called.\" So again, in \"A necessary doctrine and erudition for any Christian man, set furthe by the king's majestie of England,\" 1543, \"Onles ye believe, ye shall not understand.\" \"No man shall be crowned, onles he lawfully fight.\" \"The foul waxeth feeble, onlesse the same be cherished.\" \"It cannot begynne, onelse by the grace of God.\" Now, onles is the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb onlesan, to dismiss or remove.\n\nLes, the imperative of lesan (which has the same meaning as onlesan), is likewise used sometimes by old writers instead of unless. Instances might be given in abundance from G. Douglas and Ben Jonson; but perhaps it may be of more importance to remark, that it is this same imperative les, which, placed at the end of nouns and coalescing with them, has given to our language such adjectives as hopeles, restless, deathless, motionless, &c. i.e. dismiss hope, rest, death, motion, &c.\n\nMr Tooke observes, that all the languages which have a conjunction corresponding to less or unless, as well\nare both verbs in the imperative mode: the former signifying take away or dismiss; the latter allow, permit, grant, yield, affect. This being the case, \"Troy will be taken unless the palladium be preserved,\" is a sentence equivalent to \"Remove the palladium be preserved (taking the palladium be preserved as an abstract noun, the preservation of the palladium) Troy will be taken.\" Again, \"Troy will be taken, although Hector defend it,\" is the same as \"Troy will be taken allow Hector (to) defend it.\" The idea, therefore, expressed by unless is that of the removal of one thing to make way for another; the idea expressed by although (s) is that of allowing one thing to coexist with another, with which it is apparently incompatible.\n\n104. Before we take leave of this subject, we might treat, as others have treated, of adverbial conjunctions, and conjunctions (r) of various other denominations. But of multiplying subdivisions there is no end; and systems, in which they abound, convey for the most part no information. The nature of conjunctions can be thoroughly understood only by tracing each to its original in some parent or cognate tongue; and when that shall be done in other languages with as much success as it has lately been done by Mr Horne Tooke in English, then, and not till then, may we hope to see a rational, comprehensive, and consistent theory of this part of speech. Then too shall we get rid of all that farrago of useless distinctions into conjunctive, adjunctive, disjunctive, subjunctive, copulative, continuative, subcontinuative, positive, suppositive, causal, collective, pre-ventive adequate and inadequate, adverbal, conditional, illative, &c. &c.; which explain nothing, and which serve only to veil ignorance and perplex sagacity.\n\nThat Mr Tooke's principles will apply exactly to the conjunctions of every language both dead and living, is what our limited knowledge of these languages does not authorise us positively to affirm. It is, however, a strong presumption in favour of his opinion, that illiterate savages, the first cultivators of language, are little likely to have sent out their faculties in quest of words to denote the abstract relations subsisting among their ideas, when we have such evidence as his book affords that the names of the most common substances and qualities could answer that and every other purpose, which in the ordinary intercourse of life can be answered by the faculty of speech. It is a farther presumption in his favour,\n\nwell as the manner in which the place of these words is supplied in the languages which have not a conjunction correspondent to them, strongly justify her derivation which we have adopted. The Greek ἢ, the Latin nisi, the Italian se non, the Spanish sino, the French si non, all mean be it not. And in the same manner do we sometimes supply its place in English by but, without, be it not, but if, &c. It may be proper just to add, that, according to the same author, the conjunction lest is a contraction of lesed, the past participle of lesen; and that lest, with the article that, either expressed or understood, means no more than hoc dimissio or quo dimissio.\n\n(s) Although is compounded of al or all, and tho', though, that, or, as the vulgar more purely pronounce it, thaf, thaf, and thof. Now, thaf or thaf, is evidently the imperative thaf or thafic of the verb thafian or thafican to allow, permit, grant, yield, affect; and thafic becomes thah, though, thong, (and thoch, as G. Douglass, and other Scotch authors write it) by a transition of the same sort, and at least as easy as that by which hafic becomes hawk. It is no small confirmation of this etymology, that antiently they often used all be, albeit, all had, all were, all give, instead of although; and that as the Latin si (if) means be it, and nisi and sine (unless and without) mean be not, so etsi (although) means and be it.\n\n(r) In a work of this kind, which professes to treat of universal grammar, it would be impertinent to waste our own and our readers' time on a minute analysis of each conjunction which may occur in any one particular language. We shall therefore pursue the subject no farther; but shall subjoin Mr Horne Tooke's table of the English conjunctions, referring those who are desirous of fuller satisfaction to his ingenious work entitled The Diversions of Purley.\n\n| IF | GIFAN | To give. |\n| AN | ANAN | To grant. |\n| UNLESS | ONLESAN | To dismiss. |\n| EKE | EAKAN | To add. |\n| YET | GETAN | To get. |\n| STILL | STELLAN | To put. |\n| ELSE | ALESAN | To diminish. |\n| THOUGH | THAFICAN | To allow. |\n| or | THAFIAN | To boot, to superadd. |\n| Tho' | BOTAN | To be out. |\n| BUT | BEON-UTAN | To be out. |\n| BUT | WYRTH-UTAN | To be out. |\n| WITHOUT | AN AD | Dare congeriem. |\n\nLest is the participle lesed of lesan, to dismiss.\n\nSince | Siththan | is the participle of Seon, to see. |\n| SIN-ES | |\n\nThat is the article or pronoun that.\n\nAs is es, a German article, meaning it, that, or which. And so is sa or so, a Gothic article of the same import with as.\nfavours, that in the rudest languages there are few if any conjunctions; and that even in others which are the most highly polished, such as Greek and Latin, as well as English, many of those words which have been called conjunctions are obviously resolvable into other parts of speech. Thus ἀλλά translated but, is evidently the neuter gender of either the nominative or accusative plural of ἄλλος another; and when used as a conjunction, it intimates that you are going to add something to what you have already said. Ceterum has the same meaning, and is nothing but ἀλλά τινος. MAIS (but in French) is the Latin majus; ut, uti, uti, quod, is the relative pronoun. Of quoque, quia, praetera, antequam, quoniam, quemvis, quantumvis, quamlibet, &c., the resolution is too obvious to require being mentioned. Where such resolutions as these can be made, or when the conjunctions of any particular tongue can be traced to their origin in any other, there need be no dispute about their true import; but when the case is otherwise, and the conjunction either appears to be an original word, or is derived from a source to which it cannot be traced, we would advise such of our readers as wish to speak or write correctly, to dismiss from their minds all consideration of copulatives, continuatives, causal, and disjunctives, with the rest of that jargon which we have already mentioned; and to inquire diligently in what manner and for what purpose the conjunction in question is used by the best writers, both ancient and modern, of the particular language which they are studying. This will indeed be found a work of labour; but it appears to us to be the only means left of discovering the precise relations which such conjunctions were intended to express; and, by consequence, of knowing what words or sentences they are fitted to connect, so as to produce a style at once accurate and perspicuous.\n\nSect. II. Of Prepositions.\n\n105. By Mr Harris and his followers, a preposition is defined to be a part of speech devoid itself of signification, but so formed as to unite two words that are significant, and that refuse to coalesce or unite of themselves. We have already expressed our opinion of that theory which holds certain words to be devoid of signification; but its absurdity, in the present instance, is more than ever glaring. Concerning the number of prepositions, it is well known that hitherto authors have never agreed. The ancient Greek grammarians admitted only 18; the ancient Latin grammarians above 50; though the moderns, Sanctius, Scipio, Perizonius, Vossius, and Ruddiman, have endeavoured to lessen the number without fixing it. Bishop Wilkins thinks that 36 are sufficient; and Girard says that the French language has done the business effectually with 32. But if prepositions be words devoid of signification, why should there be disputes respecting their numbers? or why in any language should there be more than one preposition, since a single unmeaning mark of connection would certainly answer the purpose as well as a thousand? The cipher, which has no value of itself, and only serves (if we may use the language of grammarians) to connote and signify, and to change the value of figures, is not several and various, but uniformly one and the same. That \"the preposition is so formed, as to unite two words which refuse to coalesce or unite of themselves,\" is indeed true; and this union it effects, not by having no signification of its own, but by signifying the relation by which the things expressed by the united words are connected in nature. Prepositions are to be accounted for in much the same manner as the cases of nouns. The necessity of this species of words, or of some equivalent invention, follows from the impossibility of behaving in language a distinct complex term for each distinct collection of ideas which we may have occasion to put together in discourse. The addition or subtraction of any one idea to or from a collection of ideas, makes it a different collection; and if, after either of these operations, it were to be expressed by the same word as before, nothing could ensue but misrepresentation and falsehood. Now, to use in language a different and distinct complex term for each different and distinct collection of ideas, is equally impossible, as to use a distinct particular term for each particular and individual idea. To supply, therefore, the place of the complex terms which are wanting in a language, are the cases of nouns and prepositions employed; by the aid of which, complex and general terms are prevented from being infinite or too numerous, and are used only for those collections of ideas which we have most frequent occasion to mention in discourse. By means of prepositions this end is obtained in the most simple manner. For, having occasion to mention a collection of ideas for which there is no single complex term in the language, we either take that complex term which includes the greatest number, though not all of the ideas we would communicate; or else we take that complex term which includes all, and the fewest ideas more than those we would communicate; and then, by the help of the preposition, we either make up the deficiency in the one case, or retrench the superfluity in the other. For instance, having occasion to mention a house of a particular description, and knowing that the term house is too general for our purpose, and that the building we have in view has no appropriate name, we say, perhaps, a house with a party-wall, or a house without a roof.—In the first instance, the complex term house is deficient, and the preposition directs to add what is wanting.—In the second instance, the complex term is redundant as it denotes a complete house; the preposition, therefore, directs to take away what is superfluous.\n\nNow, considering prepositions in this the most simple light, as serving only to limit or modify general terms, it is absolutely necessary that they should have meanings of their own; for otherwise, how could we, in the instance before us, make known by them our intention, whether of adding to, or retrenching from, the same general term house. If, to a disciple of Mr Harris, we should say, a house join; he would reply, join what? But he would not contend that join is an indeclinable word which has no meaning of its own, because he knows that it is the imperative of a verb, of which the other parts are still in use; and its own meaning is clear, though the sentence is not completed. If, instead of join, we should say to him, a house with; he would still ask the same question, with what? But if we were to discourse with him concerning the word with, he would probably tell us, that with is a preposition, an indeclinable word, which is itself devoid of signification, but so formed as to unite two words that are significant. And yet it would be evident by his question, that he felt it had a meaning of its own; which is\nis in reality the same as JOIN (u). Indeed, so far has always been plainly perceived, that WITH and WITHOUT are directly opposite and contradictory; and it would puzzle the most acute philosopher to discover opposition and contradiction in two words where neither of them had any signification. Wilkins, therefore, has well expressed their meaning, where he says, that WITH is a preposition \"relating to the notion of social, or circumstance of society AFFIRMED;\" and that WITHOUT is a preposition relating to the same notion of social, or circumstance of society DENIED.\"\n\n106. But to denote the relations of adding and taking away, is not the only purpose for which prepositions are employed. They all indeed serve to modify some general term or general affirmation, but not precisely in the same way as WITH and WITHOUT. It has been already observed, that words significant of those things which coincide in nature, coalesce with one another in syntax, without being beholding to any auxiliary tie. For instance, an adjective coalesces with its substantive, a verb with its nominative; a noun expressing an object acted upon, with a verb denoting action; and an adverb with its verb. Take the following example: THE SPLENDID SUN GENIALLY WARMETH THE FERTILE EARTH.\n\nBut suppose we were desirous to modify this affirmation by the addition of other substantives, AIR, for instance, and BEAMS; how would these coincide with the other words of the sentence, or under what character could they be introduced? Not as nominatives or accusatives to the verb, for both these places are already filled the nominative by the substantive SUN, which is certainly the agent in this operation; the accusative by the substantive EARTH, which is as certainly the object acted upon. Not as qualities of the SUN and EARTH; for qualities inhering in their substances can only be expressed by adjectives, and the words air and beams are both substantives. Here then we must have recourse to prepositions; but we can employ only such prepositions as point out the relations which the air and the beams have to the sun warming the earth. In English we should say, \"The splendid sun WITH his beams genially warmeth THROUGH the air the fertile earth.\" The sentence, as before, remains entire and one; the substantives required are both introduced; and not a word which was there before is detracted from its proper place. The import of WITH we have already discovered; it directs to UNITE the beams to the sun, as JOINTLY with him performing the operation. But the air has no other connexion with this operation, than as the MEDIUM OF PASSAGE between the SUN and the EARTH: and therefore the preposition THROUGH (x) must denote that relation which subsists between an object in motion, and the medium in which it moves; nor could a preposition of a different import have been employed, without altering the meaning of the whole sentence (y.)\n\n107. Mr Harris is of opinion that most, if not all,\n\nVol. X. Part I.\n\n(u) This account of prepositions is taken from Horne Tooke, who adds, that the only difference between the two words WITH and JOIN, is, that the other parts of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon verb WITHAN, to join (of which WITH is the imperative), have ceased to be employed in the language. As WITH means join, so the correspondent French preposition AVEC means, and have that, or, have that also. But though WITH, as the imperative of WITHAN, means join, it has sometimes a very different signification. Mr Tyraubit in his Glossary has truly observed, that WITH and BY are often synonymous. They certainly are so; but then WITH seems to be an abbreviation of the imperative of WYRTHAN, to be; as WITHOUT is of WYRTHAN-UTAN, to be out. This being the case, our two instances in the text will stand thus: a house JOIN a party-wall; a house BE-OFF a roof. Nor let any one be surprized that we make no difference between the conjunction WITHOUT and the preposition WITHOUT. The word is the same, whether it be employed to unite words or sentences. Prepositions were originally, and for a long time, clasped with conjunctions; and when first separated from them, they were only distinguished by the name of prepositional conjunctions. They are generally used to unite words, but not always; for we may say indifferently, I came after HIS DEPARTURE, or I came after HE DEPARTED. By the greater part of grammarians, indeed, AFTER, when employed as in the first sentence, is clasped with the prepositions; when employed as in the second, it is clasped with the conjunctions. The word, however, is the same in both sentences; its meaning is the same, and its effect precisely the same. The only circumstance of discrimination is, that in the first example it is prefixed to a noun, his departure; in the second, it is prefixed to a nominative and a verb, he departed. But even the nominative and the verb, thus applied, express no more than a specifying circumstance annexed to the other proposition, I came; and whenever they are rightly apprehended by the mind, they are stript of their prepositional form, and considered abstractly under a new phasis, his departure. Thus, then, the two sentences are synonymous in every respect, excepting the apparent grammatical nature of the words his departure, and be departed; and even these are reduced to one grammatic form in the mind, whenever the import of the propositions is rightly apprehended. WITHOUT, and many other prepositions, especially in the learned languages, are used exactly as AFTER is used in the two instances which we have given. Horne Tooke quotes Lord Mansfield for saying, \"It cannot be read WITHOUT the Attorney-General consents to it.\" This, in modern English, is not the common phraseology; but it offends not against any principle of grammar. The nominative and the verb are here, as in the former instance, considered as an abstract noun. \"It cannot be read WITHOUT the consent of the Attorney-General.\"\n\n(x) THOROUGH, THOROUGH, THOROUGH, THROUGH, or THRO', is no other, says Horne Tooke, than the Gothic substantive DAURO, or the Teutonic substantive THURUH, and, like them, means door, gate, passage. So that the sentence in the text, resolved upon his principles, stands thus: \"The splendid sun—JOIN his beams—genially warmeth—PASSAGE the air, (or, the air being the passage or medium)—the fertile earth.\" And in the same manner may we translate the preposition through in every instance where through is used in English, or its equivalent preposition in any language; as from the Latin and Italian word porta (in Spanish puerta and in French porte), have come the Latin and Italian preposition per, the French par, and the Spanish por.\n\n(y) If, for instance, we were to substitute WITH or OF instead of THROUGH, we should in the one case alter the meaning.\nprepositions were originally formed to denote the relations of place. For this opinion we see not sufficient evidence. If indeed we could suppose the inventors or earliest improvers of language to have at all concerned themselves with relations as abstracted from the objects related, we must believe that those which first attracted their attention were the relations subsisting among themselves, and the various bodies with which they were surrounded. We must likewise agree with our author, that place is the grand relation which bodies or natural substances maintain at all times to one another; but we do not therefore think that it would attract the earliest notice of untaught barbarians. On the contrary, we are of opinion that mankind must have made very considerable progress in science before they attempted to abstract place from body; an attempt which, according to some of the most profound philosophers (z), is not only difficult, but absolutely impracticable. But whatever be in this, the relations of cause and effect, of duration and motion, are in themselves as obvious, and as likely to arrest the attention and obtain names, as those of place.\n\nAmong men totally illiterate they are evidently more so; for pain and pleasure would suggest some idea of cause and effect as matters of importance. There is, however, no probability that the inventors of any language had the least idea of abstract relations. They doubtless expressed complex conceptions by nouns and verbs, significant at once of the particular ideas and of the various relations by which they viewed those ideas as combined together in a complex conception. Afterwards, when men's minds became enlarged, and when, from the fluctuation inseparable from a living language, objects or ideas received new names, the old words, whether nouns or verbs, which were originally employed to express a particular complex\n\nmeaning, and in the other speak nonsense. \"The sun warmth with the air the fertile earth,\" is an affirmation that the sun warmth both the air and the earth; whereas the original sentence affirmed nothing more than that he warmed the earth. \"The sun warmth of the air the fertile earth,\" is nonsense, as it makes the earth a part, or a consequence, of the air. So necessary is it that prepositions have a meaning, and that the meaning of each be attended to.\n\n(z) The Bishops Berkeley and Law, with the very learned and ingenious Principal Campbell of Aberdeen. See The Principles of Human Knowledge, Law's Notes on King's Origin of Evil, and The Philosophy of Rhetoric.\n\n(a) As the Italian substantive casa, a house, race, family, nation, &c., in passing to the French, becomes the preposition chez, to which there is not, so far as we know, a preposition of precisely the same import in any language. Senza or senze, in Italian, becomes sans in French, and means absence. Nor is it necessary that verbs and nouns should always pass from one language to another, in order to be converted into prepositions. The Greek preposition κατά is evidently the corrupted imperative of κατάζων, to cover, to disjoin, to separate. The Latin sine is sit ne, be not. The German Sonder is the imperative of Sondern, which has the same meaning as κατάζων.\n\n(b) Up, upon, over, bove, above, have all, says Horne Tooke, one common origin and signification. In the Anglo-Saxon, ufa, ufera, ufeamæst, are the adjectives altus, altior, altissimus. Ufa or ufana, up; comparative ufera, ofere or ofer, over or upper; superlative ufeamæst, upmost or uppermost. Beufan, bufan, on-bufan, bove, above. If this be a just account of the origin of these words, the sentences in the text, where upon, over, and above, occur, will run thus: \"The statue stood on high a pedestal;\" \"the river ran higher a sand;\" \"the sun is risen on high hills.\" And here we may observe, that the mere relation between standing, running, &c. and place, is rather inferred from the verb itself, than expressed by a separate word; and the reason is obvious. For if a statue stand, every one knows that it must stand on some thing as well as at some time. There is therefore no necessity, whatever elegance there may be in it, for employing any word to denote that relation, which is commonly believed to be signified by on; but it is necessary to insert, between the verb and pedestal, a word significant of place, that pedestal may not be mistaken, by an ignorant person, for a portion of time, or anything else connected with the standing of the statue.\n\n(c) That to is significant of detached relation, is the language of Mr Harris, which, though it may be allowed in a loose and vulgar sense, is certainly not philosophically just. The preposition to (in Dutch written toe and tor) is the Gothic substantive; taui or tauihts signifying act, effect, result, or conjunction; which Gothic substantive is itself no other than the past participle tauid or tauids of the verb taujan ager. And it\nEND (of his journey) Italy; the sun is risen above the hills, i.e. the sun is risen (the place) the top of the hills; these figs came from Turkey, i.e. these figs came beginning (their journey at) Turkey.\n\nBesides the detached relation of body, Mr Harris is of opinion that the preposition FROM denotes two other relations not less different than those of motion and rest. Thus if we say, \"That lamp hangs from the ceiling,\" the preposition FROM assumes a character of quiescence.\n\nBut if we say, \"That lamp is falling from the ceiling,\" the preposition in such case assumes a character of motion.\" But this is evidently a mistake: the detached relation in the former instance of the figs, as well as the motion and rest in the present instances, are expressed not by the preposition, but by the verbs came, falls, hangs. The word from has as clear, as precise, and at all times as uniform and unequivocal a meaning, as any word in the language. From means merely BEGINNING, and nothing more.\n\nIt is obvious, that what is done, is terminated, ended, finished. In the Teutonic, this verb is written TUAN or TUON; whence the modern German THUN, and its preposition TO. In the Anglo-Saxon, the verb is TEOGAN, and the preposition TO. DO, the auxiliary verb, as it has been called, is derived from the same root, and is indeed the same word as TO. The difference between a T and a D is so very small, that an etymologist knows by the practice of languages, and an anatomist by the reason of that practice, that in the derivation of words it is scarce worth regarding. To support this etymology of TO, Mr Horne Tooke gives a similar instance in the Latin tongue. The preposition AD, he says, is merely the past participle of AGERE, which past participle is likewise employed as a Latin substantive. He exhibits the derivation of AD thus:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Agitum} & \\rightarrow \\text{agium} \\\\\n\\text{Actum} & \\rightarrow \\text{actum}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe most superficial reader of Latin verse (he observes), knows how readily the Romans dropped their final um. And a little consideration of the organs and practice of speech will convince him how easily AGD or ACT would become AD or AT; as indeed this preposition was indifferently written either way by the ancients. By the later writers of Rome, the preposition was written AD with D only, in order to distinguish it from the other corrupt word called the conjunction AT; which for the same reason was written with the T only, though that likewise had anciently been written, as the preposition, either AD or AT. The preposition TO and the conjunction TOO in English, are both in syntax and in meaning used exactly as the preposition AD and the conjunction AT in Latin. From the specimens prefixed to Johnston's dictionary, as a history of our language, it appears that, as late as the reign of Elizabeth, the preposition and conjunction were both written with one o. And it has been shown in the first volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that TO and TOO, as well as AD and AT, are precisely of the same import. The only difference, in either language, between the preposition and the conjunction, is that the former directs, as a modification of some previous proposition, the addition of some substantive or noun; the latter, sometimes a sentence or clause of a sentence considered abstractly as a noun; and that, when the former is used, the preposition, to which the modifying circumstance is to be added, is formally expressed, but omitted when the latter is employed. Thus Denham says,\n\n\"Wisdom he has, and, TO his wisdom courage;\nTemper TO that, and, UNTO all, succeeds.\"\n\nIn this example, every succeeding circumstance is by the preposition TO marked as an addition to the preceding. \"Wisdom he has, and courage additional to his wisdom.\" But Denham might with equal propriety have omitted the object which TO governs, or to which it directs something to be added, though he must then, from the custom of the language, have employed the conjunction instead of the preposition. As,\n\n\"Wisdom he has, and courage too,\" &c.\n\nThis mode of expression would have been more concise, and as intelligible as the other, \"Wisdom he has, and courage TO his wisdom,\" &c.\n\nNot only is the object governed by TO omitted, when it is represented by a substantive in the context, but also when it is involved in a preposition; and then the conjunction, as it is called, is always used. Thus,\n\n\"The daring crime, behold the vengeance TOO.\"\n\nSo, \"He made him prisoner, and killed him TOO.\" In the one example, the circumstance of beholding the vengeance is stated as an addition to the viewing of the crime; and in the other, the killing him is stated as an addition to the making him a prisoner. In both examples, the object governed by TOO is the amount of the preceding proposition taken abstractly as a noun or substantive. Thus then it appears, that TO and TOO, though clasped the one with the prepositions, and the other with the conjunctions, are really one and the same word. The same is true of AD and AT. Thus, \"AD hoc, promissa barba et capilli effaverant speciem oris,\" signifies \"Additional to this, his long beard and hair had given a wildness to his aspect.\" But when the object governed by AD is not formally stated, AD itself is clasped with the conjunction, and written differently, AT. Thus Terence, \"PH. Fac ita ut juvi, educantur illi. PA. Faciam. PH. AT diligenter. PA. Fiet. PH. AT mature.\" By the means of AT, the circumstances of diligence and haste are superadded to the action commanded. \"PH. It is not enough that you do it, you must do it carefully TOO. PA. Well, it shall be carefully done. PH. In good time TOO.\" AT, taken in this sense, is most commonly employed, like the English BUT, to mark the unexpected union of incongruous objects: AS, \"Aulam tyranni frequentabat, AT patriam amabat;\" literally, \"He frequented the court of the tyrant; joined EVEN to that he loved his country.\" \"He was a courtier and a patriot TOO.\" But if AD and AT in Latin, and TO and TOO in English, be derived from verbs which signify TO DO or ACT, it may be asked how they come themselves to denote addition. The answer is obvious.\nthing else. It is simply the Anglo-Saxon and Gothic noun *frum*, meaning *beginning, origin, source, fountain, author* (n). Now if this meaning be applied to Mr Harris's instances, *from* will speak clearly for itself, without the assistance of the interpreting verbs, which are supposed by him to vary its character.\n\n\"The figs came from Turkey.\"\n\"That lamp falls from the ceiling.\"\n\"That lamp hangs from the ceiling.\"\n\n*Game* is a complex term for one species of motion; *fall* is a complex term for another species of motion; and *hang* is a complex (E) term for a species of attachment. Have we occasion to communicate or mention the commencement or beginning of these motions, and of this attachment, and also the place where they commence or begin? To have complex terms for each occasion of this sort is absolutely impossible; and therefore nothing can be more natural or more simple than to add the signs of those ideas, viz., the word *beginning* (which will remain always the same) and the name of the place (which will perpetually vary). Thus,\n\n\"The figs came—beginning Turkey.\"\n\"That lamp falls—beginning ceiling.\"\n\"That lamp hangs—beginning ceiling.\"\n\nThat is,\n\n\"Turkey the place of beginning to come.\"\n\"Ceiling the place of beginning to fall.\"\n\"Ceiling the place of beginning to hang.\"\n\nIt has been said by no less a man than Bishop Wilkins, that *from* refers primarily to place, and secondarily to time. But the truth is, that *from* relates to every thing to which beginning relates, and to nothing else.\n\n\"From morn till night the eternal larum rang.\"\nThat is, \"The larum rang beginning morning (or morning being the time of its beginning) till night.\"\n\nAs *from* always denotes beginning, so *to* and *till* always denote the end. There is, however, this difference between them, that *to* denotes the end of any thing; *till* the end only of time. We may say indifferently—\"From morn to night,\" or \"from morn till night, the eternal larum rang;\" but we cannot say—\"These figs came from Turkey till England.\"\n\nThat *till* can, with propriety, be opposed to *from* only when we are talking of time, is evident; for it is a word compounded of *to* and *while*, i.e., *time*. And as the coalescence of these two words *to*-while, took place in the language long before the present superfluous use of the article *the*, the phrase—\"From morn till night\"—is neither more nor less than—\"From morn to time night.\" When we say, \"from morn to night,\" the word *time* is omitted as unnecessary.\n\nBesides *from*, Mr Harris mentions *over* as significant sometimes of motion and sometimes of rest; and quotes as instances the two following passages from Milton:\n\n\"To support uneasy steps\nOver the burning marl.\"\n\nHere, says he, *over* denotes motion. Again,\n\n\"He with looks of cordial love\nHung over her enamoured.\"\n\nHere *over* denotes rest. But the truth is, that *over* denotes neither motion nor rest in either of the passages. In the first quotation, indeed, motion is implied; but it is implied in the word *steps*; and not in *over*, which denotes only that the place of the steps was the top of the burning marl. In the second quotation *rest* is implied, and that too a particular species of rest; but it is implied or rather expressed by the verb *hung*, and *over* denotes the place of that species of rest.\n\n108. But though the original use of prepositions was to denote the relations of body, they could not be confined to this office only. They by degrees extended themselves to subjects incorporeal; and came to denote relations, as well intellectual as local. Thus, because in extended to place he who is above has commonly the advantage over him who is below; hence we transfer *over* and *under* (f) to dominion and obedience. Of a king, we say, be ruled over his people; of a soldier, be served under his general. So too we say, with thought; without attention; thinking over a subject; under anxiety; from fear; through jealousy, &c. All which instances, with many others of like kind, show, that the first words of men, like their first ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects; and that in after days, when they began to discern with their intellect, they took those words which they\n\nIf a man should utter a sentence, and to the end of it subjoin the very general word *do*, the person to whom he spoke, would naturally ask, *do what?* and this question would, of course, produce an additional sentence or clause of a sentence. Besides, it is to be observed, that *agere*, from which the Latin preposition is derived, as well as the Gothic verb, which is the source of the English particles, means not only to do, but also to aduce or bring; so that when we say, \"he is going to Italy,\" we do nothing more than affirm that \"he is going,\" and define the person to whom we speak, \"to add Italy to the journey.\"\n\nFrom this derivation of the preposition *to*, it will be seen at once upon what principle it is employed to mark the infinitive mode. In the learned languages that mode is generally known by its termination; but in English it would be impossible, without the aid of *to* or of some other word significant of action, to distinguish the verb *love* from the noun or substantive.\n\n(d) This derivation is Mr Horne Tooke's; and he supports it by the following sentence: *Ne redd ge se the on frumman worthe, he worithe wæpman and wifmen*; which is the Anglo-Saxon of St Matt. xix. 4.\n\n\"Amnon legitlis, quod qui eos in principio creavit, creavit eos marem et feminam?\"\n\n(e) These are complex terms because they are verbs. Each denotes an affirmation and time; and combined with these, *came* and *falls* denote motion, and *hangs* denotes rest.\n\n(f) Under and beneath, though by the found they seem to have little connection, are yet in fact almost the same word, and may very well supply each other's place. Under is nothing but on-neder, and beneath is compounded of the imperative *be* and the noun *neath*. Neath uncompounded having slipped away from our language, would perhaps be unintelligible, had not the noun *nether* and nethermost still continued in common use. Neath; Anglo-Saxon, neothan, neotha; Dutch, nedden; Danish, ned; German, niedre; and Swedish, nedre and nedder; is undoubtedly as much a substantive, and has the same meaning, as the word *nadir*. In common language it denotes the bottom.\nthey found already made, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual conceptions.\n\nAmong the relations which may be considered rather as intellectual than corporeal, are those of cause and consequence; and for the denoting of these we have two prepositions, which sometimes appear in direct opposition to one another, and at other times may exchange places without injury to the sense.\n\n\"Well! 'tis e'en so! I have got the London dilette they call love. I am sick or my husband, and for my gallant.\"\n\nHere of and for seem almost placed in opposition; at least their effects in the sentence appear to be very different; for, by the help of these two prepositions alone, and without the assistance of any other words, the expression of the contrary affections of loathing and desire. The truth, however, is, that the author, if it had pleased him, might have used of where he has employed for, and for where he has put of. This is evident from the following quotation:\n\n\"Marian. Come, Amie, you'll go with us.\"\n\"Amie. I am not well.\"\n\"Lionel. She's sick or the young shepherd that be kisses her.\"\n\nSad Shepherd.\n\nIn the same manner we may, with equal propriety, say—\"We are sick or hunger;\" or—\"We are sick for hunger.\" And in both cases we shall have expressed precisely the same thing, with only this difference, that, in the former sentence, we declare sickness to be a consequence; in the latter, we declare hunger to be a cause. But to return to the country wife; that poor lady seems to have had a complication of distempers; she had, at least, two disorders—a sickness or loathing, and a sickness or love. She was sick for disgust, and sick for love. She was\n\nSick or disgust for her husband;\nSick or love for her gallant.\n\nSick for disgust of her husband.\nSick for love of her gallant.\n\nIn the first sentence, as thus stated, sickness is declared to be the consequence of disgust, of which her husband is declared to be the cause. In the second, sickness is declared to be the consequence of love, of which her gallant is declared to be the cause. In the third sentence, disgust is declared to be the cause of her sickness, and the consequence or offspring of her husband. In the fourth, love is declared to be the cause of her sickness, and the consequence or offspring of her gallant.\n\nThus, then, it appears, that though the two first of these sentences, taken entire, convey the very same meaning with the two last, yet the import of the preposition for is as different from that of or, as cause is from consequence (G). When two words or sentences are linked together by the former of these prepositions, the object expressed by the last word or sentence is declared to be the cause of that which is expressed by the preceding; when two words or sentences are linked together by the latter preposition, the object expressed by the first word or sentence is declared to be the consequence of, or to proceed from, the object expressed by the second. It is therefore a matter of perfect indifference to the sense, whether we say sickness or hunger, or sickness for hunger; the man, or he speaks little, is wise, or the man is wise, or he speaks little. By means of the preposition of, we declare sickness to be the consequence proceeding from hunger, and wisdom to be the consequence we infer from the man's speaking little; by means of for, we declare hunger to be the cause of sickness, and the circumstance of speaking little to be the cause from which we infer the man's wisdom. In the one sentence, of is to be considered as a noun in apposition to sickness; in the other, as a noun in apposition to the man is wise taken abstractly as a noun. In the one sentence for (i.e., cause) is to be considered as a noun in apposition to hunger; in the other, as the same noun in apposition to he speaks little taken abstractly as a noun.\n\nIn the foregoing use of prepositions, we have preposed how they are applied by way of juxta-position; that is to say, where they are prefixed to a word without becoming a part of it. But they are used also with other way of composition; that is, they are prefixed to other words, so as to become real parts of them. Thus in Greek we have συνειδητος; in Latin intelligere; and in English understand. So also, to forget, to overact, to undervalue, to outrage, &c.; and in Greek and Latin other instances innumerable. In this case the prepositions commonly transmute something of their own meaning into the word with which they are compounded.\n\nFor example, if we suppose some given space, E and EX transmute signify out of that space; PER, through it; IN, within it; SUB under it. Hence E and PER, in composition, augment; and mean Enormis is something not simply big, but big in excess; into something got out of the rule, and beyond the measure, those words Dico, \"to speak;\" edicio, \"to speak out;\" whence edificium \"an edifice,\" something to effectually spoken as all are supposed to hear and all to obey.—On the contrary, IN and SUB diminish and lessen. Injustus, iniquus, \"unjust, inequitable;\" something that lies within justice and equity, that reaches not so far, that falls short of them. Subniger, \"blackish;\" subrubicundus \"reddish;\" tending to black, and tending to red; but yet under the standard, and below perfection.\n\nBefore we dismiss this part of our subject, we shall make the same general remark on prepositions that import how we formerly made on conjunctions; viz., that the precise import of each can with certainty be known only by tracing it to its source in some word of known and determinate meaning, either in the language where the preposition itself has place, or in some parent or cognate tongue. And it may be laid down as an infallible rule, that where different languages use the same or a similar particle, that language ought to be considered as its legitimate parent, in which the true meaning of the word can be found, and where its use is as common and familiar as that of any other verbs and substantives.\n\n(G) Junius derives FOR from the Greek προ; Skinner, from the Latin pro; but I believe, says Horne Tooke, that it is no other than the Gothic substantive FAIRIN, \"causa.\" He imagines also that OF (in the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon AF) is a fragment of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon words AFARA and AFORA, polleritar, proler, &c. In a word, he considers FOR and OF as nouns or substantives; the former always meaning cause, the latter always meaning consequence, offspring, successor, follower, &c. If this account of these words be just, and we have no doubt of it, the prepositions FOR and OF are in syntax to be considered as nouns in apposition with other nouns, or with sentences taken abstractly as nouns.\nInterjections. When prepositions can be traced to such sources as these, no room can be left for disputes concerning their meaning. In carrying on this etymological pursuit, we find advantages in the nature of prepositions which conjunctions do not afford us. With and without, from and to, with many other words belonging to this class, have meanings directly opposite and contradictory to each other. If, then, by the total or partial extinction of an original language, the root of any one preposition be lost, whilst that of its opposite remains, the philosopher ought to be satisfied with reasoning from contrariety; as nothing is more evident, than that the meaning of a word is known when we know with precision the meaning of its opposite. When we meet, however, with a luckless preposition of which no root is left to be dug up, and which itself no direct opposite in the language, nothing remains but that we inquire for what purpose it is used by the best writers both ancient and modern; and if we can fix upon one meaning which will apply, however awkwardly, to all the places where it occurs, or to the greater part of them, the probability is, that we have discovered the true and original (H) meaning of the preposition; and by keeping that meaning constantly in view, we shall ourselves be enabled to use the word with perspicuity and precision.\n\nSect. III. Of Interjections.\n\n111. Besides the above parts of speech, there is another acknowledged in all the languages of Europe, called the interjection; a word which cannot be comprehended under any of the foregoing classes. The genuine interjections are very few in number, and of very little importance, as they are thrown into a sentence without altering its form either in syntax or in signification. In the words of Horne Tooke, the brutish inarticulate interjection has nothing to do with speech, and is only the miserable refuge of the speechless. The dominion of speech, according to the same author, is erected on the downfall of interjections. Without the artful contrivances of languages, mankind would have nothing but interjections with which to communicate orally any of their feelings. \"The neighing of a horse, the lowing of a cow, the barking of a dog, the purring of a cat, sneezing, coughing, groaning, shrieking, and every other involuntary convulsion with oral sound, have almost as good a title to be called parts of speech as interjections. In the intercourse of language, interjections are employed only when the suddenness or vehemence of some affection or passion returns men to their natural state, and makes them for a moment forget the use of speech; or when, from some circumstance, the shortness of time will not permit them to exercise it.\" The genuine interjection, which is always expressive of some very strong sensation, such as AH! when we feel pain, does not owe its characteristic expression to the arbitrary form of articulation, but derives its whole force from the tone of voice and modification of countenance and gesture. Of consequence, these tones and gestures express the same meaning, without any relation to the articulation which they may assume; and are therefore universally understood by all mankind. Voluntary interjections are used in books only for embellishment, and to mark forcibly a strong emotion. But where speech can be employed, they are totally useless; and are always insufficient for the purpose of communicating thought, Dr Beattie ranks strange, prodigious, amazing, wonderful, O dear, dear me, &c., when used alone, and without apparent grammatical syntax, among the interjections; but he might with as much propriety have considered hardly, truly, really, and even many Latin verbs, as interjections; for these two are often used alone, to supply the place of whole sentences. The truth is, that all men, when suddenly and violently agitated, have a strong tendency to shorten their discourse by employing a single word to express a sentiment. In such cases, the word employed, whether noun, adjective or verb, would be the principal word of the sentence, if that sentence were completed; and the agitation of the speaker is such, and the cause of it so obvious, that the hearer is in no danger of mistaking the sense, and can himself supply the words that are wanting. Thus if a person, after listening to a romantic narrative, were to exclaim, strange! would any man of common sense suppose, that the word strange, because uttered alone, had lost the power of an adjective and become an interjection? No, surely: Every one sees, that the exclamation is equivalent to, That is strange, or That is a strange story. Real interjections are never employed to convey truth of any kind. They are not to be found amongst laws, in books of civil institutions, in history, or in any treatise of useful arts or sciences; but in rhetoric and poetry, in novels, plays and romance, where in English, so far from giving pathos to the style, they have generally an effect that is disgusting or ridiculous.\n\nHaving now analysed every part of speech which can be necessary for the communication of thought, or which is acknowledged in any language with which we are acquainted; we shall dismiss the article of Grammar, after annexing a Table, which may present at one view the several classes and subdivisions of words. Of the different modes of dividing the parts of speech, as well as of the little importance of systematic classifications, we have already declared our decided opinion: but for the sake of those who may think differently from us, we shall in the annexed Table adopt Mr Harris's classification as far as it is intelligible; after informing our readers that Mr Horne Tooke admits only three parts of speech, the article, the noun, and the verb, and considers all other words as corruptions or abbreviations of the two last of these.\n\n---\n\n(n) For instance, let us suppose that Horne Tooke's derivation of FOR, from the Gothic substantive FAIRINA, is fanciful and ill-founded; yet there can be little doubt but CAUSE is its true and original meaning, when it is found, that of fifteen examples brought by Greenwood, and forty-five by Johnson, of different significations of the word FOR, there is not one where the noun CAUSE may not be substituted instead of the preposition FOR; sometimes indeed awkwardly enough, but always without injury to the sense. Even where FOR seems to be loco alterius, which Lowth affords to be its primary sense, it will be found to be CAUSE, and nothing else: Thus He made considerable progress in the study of the law before he quitted that profession for this of poetry; i.e. before he quitted that profession, this of poetry being the cause of his quitting it.\nGRAMMARIAN, one that is skilled in or teaches grammar.\n\nAnciently the name grammarian was a title of honour, literature, and erudition, being given to persons accounted learned in any art or faculty whatever. But it is otherwise now, being frequently used as a term of reproach, to signify a dry plodding person employed about words and phrases, but inattentive to the true beauties of expression and delicacy of sentiment. The ancient grammarians, called also philologists, must not be confounded with the grammatici, whose sole business was to teach children the first elements of language. Varro, Cicero, Maffa, and even Julius Caesar, thought it no dishonour to be ranked grammarians, who had many privileges granted to them by the Roman emperors.\n\nGRAMMONT, a town of France, in Upper Vienne, remarkable for its abbey, which is the chief of the order. E. Long. 1° 30'. N. Lat. 46° 1'.\n\nGRAMPION HILLS; a chain of high mountains in Scotland, which run from east to west almost the whole breadth of the kingdom. See (Scottish) ALPS and SCOTLAND.—They take their name from only a single hill, the Mons Grampius of Tacitus, where Gallicus waited the approach of Agricola, and where the battle was fought so fatal to the brave Caledonians.\n\nGRAMPOUND, a town of Cornwall in England, seated on the river Valle, over which there is here a bridge. W. Long. 5° 25'. N. Lat. 50° 20'. The inhabitants have a considerable manufacture of gloves; and the town sends two members to parliament. Some think that this town is the Voluba of the ancients, because it stands on the same river; and that on the building of the bridge, the name was changed into Grandpont. It was made a borough in the reign of Edward III., by whose charter it was endowed with large privileges, particularly freedom from toll through all Cornwall, a market on Saturday, and three fairs in the year; which the burgesses hold of the duchy of Cornwall in fee-farm, at the rent of about 12 guineas. Its privileges were confirmed by King Henry VIII., but it did not send members to parliament till the reign of Edward VI. It is a corporation with a mayor, eight magistrates, a recorder, and town-clerk. The mayor is chosen annually the Tuesday before Michaelmas, and the members by the majority of the magistrates and freemen, who are such of the inhabitants as pay scot and lot. There is a chapel of ease in the town to the parish-church, which is at Creed about a quarter of a mile off.\n\nGRAMPUS, a species of delphinus. See DELPHINUS, CETOLOGY Index.\n\nGRANADA, a province of Spain, which for a long time was a kingdom distinct from the rest of that country. See the article SPAIN.—It made a part of the ancient Baetica; and was inhabited by the Bastuli, the Sextiani, &c. At present it is sometimes called Upper Andalusia. It is bounded to the south and east by the Mediterranean, to the west and north by Lower Andalusia, and to the north-east by Murcia. Its extent from west to east is two hundred and ten miles; but its greatest breadth exceeds not eighty. The air here is temperate and healthy; and though there are many mountains in the province, and some of them very high, yet they are almost everywhere covered with vines and fruit-trees, together with laurel, myrtle, sweet-basil, thyme, lavender, marjoram, and other aromatic herbs, which give an exquisite taste to the flesh of their sheep and cattle. A great deal of silk and sugar, flax and hemp, honey and wax, is also produced here; besides dates and acorns, superior to the finest nuts; good stone for building; several sorts of gems; sumach, used in dressing goat-skins; and galls, of which a dye is made for leather. The valleys, with which the mountains are interperforated, are extremely beautiful and fertile. The inhabitants of some of the highest mountains are said to be descendants of the Moors; and, though they are become Roman Catholics, retain, in a great measure, their ancient customs, manners, and language. The principal rivers in the province are the Genil or Xenil, and Guadalentin, besides which there are many lesser streams. Abundance of salt is made in this province; which, though neither so populous nor so well cultivated as when subject to the Moors, yet is as much so as in any Spain. It was the last of the kingdoms possessed by the Moors, and was not reduced and annexed to the crown of Castile until 1492.\n\nGranada, the capital of the above province, is situated at the foot of the Sierra Nevada, or the Snowy Mountain, in a wholesome air and fruitful country, an hundred and eighty miles south of Madrid, in W. Long. 2° 30'. N. Lat. 36° 56'. It stands upon two hills separated by the Darro. The Genil runs under the walls, and these two rivers are formed from the melting of the snow with which the mountain is constantly covered. The Darro is said to carry with it small particles of gold; and its name, derived from dat aurum, may be alleged as a proof of this: the Genil, in like manner, rolls with its stream little pieces of silver. When Charles V. came to Granada in 1526, with the empress Isabella, the city presented him with a crown made of gold gathered from the Darro. The city is large and magnificent, containing a great number of very handsome public and private buildings. Its walls, which are adorned with many towers at equal distances, are said to be ten miles in compass. Here are two castles; the one built by the Moors, and the other by Charles V. and Philip II. They both command a very fine prospect; and the first is so large, that it looks like a city by itself; and, it is said, has room enough to accommodate forty thousand people, exclusive of the royal palace, and the convent of St Francis. Here is also a court of inquisition; a royal tribunal; and an university, founded in 1531; with the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of forty thousand ducats per annum. A great many noblemen, clergymen, and wealthy citizens, reside in this city, of which the silk trade and manufacture is very great, and the arsenal is said to be the best furnished of any in Spain. The inhabitants, who are partly descended of the Moors, are well supplied with water. There are several fine squares, particularly that called the Bivaramba, or Plaza Mayor; where the bull-fights are held; and without the city is a large plain, full of towns and villages, called La Vega de Granada.\n\nThe Moors are said to regret nothing but Granada, amongst all the losses they have sustained in Spain; they mention it in all their evening prayers, and supplicate heaven\nGranada, heaven to restore it to their possession. The last Moorish ambassador who came into Spain obtained permission of the king to see Granada; he fled tears on entering the Alhambra, and could not refrain from exclaiming, that the folly of his ancestors had deprived them and their posterity of that delightful country.\n\nGranada had formerly twenty gates: the first, that of Elvira, which still remains; the second, that of Bibalmaraz, or of conference, because, with the Moors, it was a kind of place of resort where they conferred on affairs; the third, Vivambla, so called from its leading to a grand square which still bears the same name; the fourth, Bib Racha, or of provisions; the fifth, Bitaum, or the gate of the hermits, which led to different solitudes, the abodes of dervishes; the sixth, Bibmitre, or Biblicina, the first gate; the seventh, the mill gate; the eighth, that of the sun, because it opened to the east; the ninth, the gate of the Alhambra, called by the Moors Bib Luxar; the tenth, Bib Adain, or the gate of the bones of Adam; the twelfth, Bib Cieda, the gate of the nobles; the Moors kept this gate shut for a long time, because it had been predicted that the enemies which should one day take the city, would enter by that gate; the thirteenth, that of Faxalauza, or of the hills of almond trees; the fourteenth, the lion gate, in Arabic, Bib Elceei; the fifteenth, the court gate, called by the Moors Alacabar; the sixteenth, Bib Alboum, or the gate of the Banners, at present the magdalen gate; the seventeenth, that of the Darro; the eighteenth, that of the Moaiyaca; the nineteenth, that called the gate of Ecce Homo; the twentieth, that by the side of the Alhambra.\n\nThe Moors have left more monuments in Granada than in any other city in Spain. From the great number of inscriptions in and about the city, and the fine edifices of the Alhambra and the Generalife, it might be supposed these people intended to make Granada the greatest depository of their religion, manners, customs, and magnificence. There is not a wall which does not bear some marks of their power; but notwithstanding this abundance of monuments, the reign of the Moors in Spain is still buried in confusion and obscurity. The ignorance of the Spaniards, their superstition, and the hatred they bore the Moors, have much contributed to this darkness; they have either destroyed, or suffered to be effaced by time, everything which bore the mark of Mahometanism, instead of preserving the monuments of antiquity, which at the same time were those of their own glory; and it may be said, that chance alone, and the folly of their construction, much more than curiosity or a love of the arts, has preserved those which still exist, though daily going to ruin.\n\nAn account of the Alhambra has been already given under its name in the order of the alphabet. From the hall of Comares there mentioned, there is a modern little staircase; the old one, which corresponded to the beauty of the edifice, having been destroyed. At the top of the staircase is a gallery, a part of which is inclosed with an iron railing: this kind of cage is called the prison of the queen. It was here the wife of the last king of Granada was imprisoned. The Gomels and Legris, two families of distinction, bore false witness against her virtue, and occasioned the destruction of the greatest part of the Abencerrages, another powerful and numerous family of Granada of whom Granada they were jealous. The history of this event is given as follows:\n\nIn the year 1491, Abdali, nicknamed the Little, still reigned in Granada; but this city was upon the brink of ruin, for the principal families were divided against each other. The Moors had carried their arms against Jaen, and had been bravely repulsed. Abdali was confining himself in one of his pleasure houses for the ill success of his enterprise, when the Zegris, who long had been the secret enemies of the Abencerrages, took the opportunity of this defeat to represent them to the king as rebellious subjects, who employed their immense riches to gain the favour of the people and dethrone their sovereign. They accused Alon Hamet, the most rich and powerful among them, of having an adulterous commerce with the queen, and produced witnesses who asserted they had seen a certain festival scene, at Generalife, under a bower of oleo trees, Albin Hamet in the arms of that princess. The fury of Abdali may easily be imagined; he swore the destruction of the Abencerrages. But the Zegris, too prudent to let his anger break forth, advised him to dissemble, and not to suffer it to be known to that numerous and powerful family that he was informed of their perfidy. It will be better, said they, to entice them into the snare, and, before they can unite and put themselves into a state of defence, revenge upon their heads the insult offered to the crown. This advice was followed; Abdali went to the Alhambra, having ordered thirty of his guards to arm themselves, and the executioner to attend. The Abencerrages were sent for one by one, and beheaded as soon as they entered the hall of the lions, where there is still a large vase of alabastrum, which was quickly filled with blood and the heads of expiring bodies. Thirty-five heads had already been struck off, and all the Abencerrages would have died in the same manner, had not a page, who had followed his master, and remained unperceived in the hurry of the execution, taken an opportunity of withdrawing and giving information to the rest of the unhappy family of what had passed. These immediately assembled their friends in arms, crying out through the city of Granada, \"Treason! treason! Let the king die! he unjustly puts to death the Abencerrages!\" The people, with whom they were favourites, did not hesitate in assailing them: fourteen thousand men were soon found in arms, and immediately proceeded towards the Alhambra, shouting all the way, \"Let the king die! Abdali, surprised his secret should have been so soon discovered, and feverishly repenting of having followed the pernicious counsels he had received, ordered the castle gates to be shut; but they were presently set on fire. Muley Hacen, who had been forced to abdicate the throne in favour of his son, hearing the tumult of the people, had one gate opened, and presented himself to appease the rage of the citizens; but he no sooner appeared, than he was lifted up by the multitude near the gate, who cried out, \"Behold our king, we will have no other, long live Muley Hacen!\" and leaving him surrounded by a strong guard, the Abencerrages, and other nobles, entered the castle, accompanied by upwards of a hundred soldiers. But they found the queen only, with her women, and in the utmost consternation at the\nudden revolution, of which he knew not the cause. They asked for the king; and being informed he was in the hall of the lions, entered it furiously, and found him defended by the Zegris and the Gomels, and in less than two hours killed upwards of two hundred of them. Abdali had the good fortune to escape. The bodies of the beheaded Abencerrages were laid upon black cloth, and carried to the city. Muza, brother to Abdali, and who by his great actions had gained the favour of the people, seeing the Abencerrages were revenged, found means to appease them; and having learned that the king had taken refuge in a mosque near the mountain now called Saint Helena, went and brought him back to the castle of the Alhambra. For several days nothing but sighs and groans were heard throughout the city. Abdali shut himself up in the castle, and refused to see the queen. Those who had accused her of adultery, however, persisted in their false accusation, and said, they would maintain, with arms in their hands, against all who should contradict them, that the queen was guilty. The unhappy princess was imprisoned, and the day arriving on which she was to perish by the hands of the executioner, when none among the Moors offering to defend her, she was advised to commit her cause to some Christian knights, who presented themselves at the time appointed, and conquered her false accusers, so that she was immediately set at liberty. The taking of Granada soon followed this combat; Muza and the Abencerrages having, it is said, facilitated the conquest of it by Ferdinand and Isabella.\n\nFrom the Alhambra you enter the Generalife by a low gate, which favoured the escape of Abdali when Ferdinand took Granada. Generalife is said to signify, in Arabic, the house of love, of dance, and pleasure. It was built by a prince of the name of Omar, who was so fond of music, that he retired to this palace, entirely to give himself up to that amusement. The Generalife is the most pleasing situation in the environs of Granada. It is built upon a very high mountain, whence waters rush from every side, which escape in torrents, and fall in beautiful cascades in the courts, gardens, and halls of that ancient palace. The gardens form an amphitheatre, and are full of trees, venerable from their antiquity. Two cypresses in particular are noted, called the Cypresses of the queen, because it was near them the perfidious Gomel impeached the virtue of that princess and the honour of the Abencerrages. Of this place, travellers observe, that the writers of romances have never imagined a scene equal to it.\n\nGranada was formerly called Illiberia, and founded, if we will believe some writers, by Liberia, a great-grand-daughter of Hercules, daughter of Hispan, and wife to Hesperus, a Grecian prince, and brother to Atalanta. Others, who support their assertions by proofs so full as satisfactory, maintain that it was founded by Iberus, grandson of Tubal, and that it took the name of Granada, or Garnata, from Nata the daughter of Liberia; this word being composed of Gar (which in the language of the time signified grotto) and Nata; that is, \"the grotto of Nata,\" because that princess studied astrology and natural history, and delighted in the country. It is certain that such a person as Nata, or Natayda, existed in the first ages of the foundation of Granada; and that in the place where the Alhambra now stands, there was a temple dedicated to Nativala. The date of the foundation of Granada is said to be 2808 years before Christ. We know that in the time of the Romans it was a municipal colony.—A description in Latin of Granada, such as it was in 1560, written by a merchant at Antwerp, named George Hofnabbel, who travelled into Spain, is to be found in the work intitled Civitatis orbis terrarum, printed at Cologne in 1576. This book also contains a good plan of the city of Granada.\n\nGranada, or Grenada, one of the Caribbee islands. See Grenada.\n\nGranada, a town of America, in the province of Nicaragua, and in the audience of Guatemala, seated on the lake Nicaragua, 70 miles from the South sea. It was taken twice by the French buccaneers, and pillaged. The inhabitants carry on a great trade by means of the lake, which communicates with the North sea. W. Long. 85° 10' N. Lat. 11° 8'.\n\nGranada, New, a province of South America, in Terra Firma, about 75 miles in length, and as much in breadth. It is bounded on the north by Carthagena and St Martha, on the east by Venezuela, on the south by Popayan, and on the west by Darien. It contains mines of gold, copper, and iron; horses, mules, good pastures, corn, and fruits. It belongs to the Spaniards, and Santa-Fe de-Bagota is the capital town.\n\nGranadilloes, the name of some islands of the Caribbees, in America, having St Vincent to the north and Granada to the south. They are so insignificant that they are quite neglected; but were ceded to England by the treaty of peace in 1763.\n\nGranadier, a soldier armed with a sword, a firelock, a bayonet, and a pouch full of hand grenades. They wear high caps, are generally the tallest and briskest fellows, and are always the first upon all attacks.\n\nEvery battalion of foot has generally a company of grenadiers belonging to it; or else four or five grenadiers belong to each company of the battalion, which, on occasion, are drawn out, and form a company of themselves. These always take the right of the battalion.\n\nGranado or Grenade, in the art of war, a hollow ball or shell of iron or other metal, of about 2½ inches diameter, which being filled with fine powder, is set on fire by means of a small fuse driven into the fuse-hole, made of well-seasoned beech-wood, and thrown by the grenadiers into those places where the men stand thick, particularly into the trenches and other lodgements made by the enemy. As soon as the composition within the fuse gets to the powder in the granado, it bursts into many pieces, greatly to the damage of all who happen to be in its way. Granadoes were invented about the year 1594. The author of the Military Dictionary has the following remark on the use of granadoes. \"Grenades have unaccountably sunk into disuse; but I am persuaded there is nothing more proper than to have grenades to throw among the enemy who have jumped into the ditch. During the siege of Cassel under the count de la Lippe, in the campaign of 1762, a young engineer undertook...\"\nundertook to carry one of the outworks with a much smaller detachment than one which had been repulsed, and succeeded with ease from the use of grenades; which is a proof that they should not be neglected, either in the attack or defence of forts.\"—The word Granado takes its rise from hence, that the shell is filled with grains of powder, as a pomegranate is with kernels.\n\nGRANARD, a borough, market, fair, and post town in the county of Longford, province of Leinster; it gives title of earl to the family of Forbes; situated 52 miles from Dublin, and about 16 north-east of Longford, N. Lat. 53° 44'. W. Long. 7° 30'. Here is a remarkable hill or mound, called the Moat of Granard, thought to be artificial, and the site of a Danish castle or fort; which commands from its summit a most extensive prospect into five or seven adjoining counties. In this town have lately been given annual prizes to the best performers on the Irish harp. Granard has a barrack for a company of foot; and returns two members to parliament; patronage in the families of Macartney and Greville. Fairs held 3d May and 1st October. This place takes its name from Granard, or \"the height of the fun,\" and was formerly the residence of the chiefs of North Teffia. It is sometimes written Grenard.\n\nGRANARY, a building to lay or store corn in, especially that designed to be kept a considerable time. Sir Henry Wotton advises to make it look towards the north, because that quarter is the coolest and most temperate. Mr. Worlidge observes, that the best granaries are built of brick, with quarters of timber wrought in the inside, to which the boards may be nailed, with which the inside of the granary must be lined so close to the bricks, that there may not be any room left for vermin to shelter themselves. There may be many stories one above another, which should be near the one to the other; because the shallower the corn lies, it is the better, and more easily turned.\n\nThe two great cautions to be observed in the erecting of granaries are, to make them sufficiently strong, and to expose them to the most drying winds. The ordering of the corn in many parts of England, particularly in Kent, is thus: To separate it from dust and other impurities after it is threshed, they toss it with shovels from one end to the other of a long and large room; the lighter substances fall down in the middle of the room, and the corn only is carried from side to side, or end to end of it. After this they screen the corn, and then bringing it into the granaries, it is spread about half a foot thick, and turned from time to time about twice in a week; once a-week they also repeat the screening it. This sort of management they continue about two months, and after that they lay it a foot thick for two months more; and in this time they turn it once a-week, or twice if the season be damp, and now and then screen it again. After about five or six months they raise it to two feet thickness in the heaps, and then they turn it one or twice in a month, and screen it now and then. After a year, they lay it two and a half or three feet deep, and turn it once in three weeks or a month, and screen it proportionately. When it has lain two years or more, they turn it once in two months, and screen it once a-quarter; and how long forever it is kept, the oftener the turning and screening are repeated, the better the grain will be found to be.—It is proper to leave an area of a yard wide on every side of the heap of corn, and other empty spaces, into which they turn and toss the corn as often as they find occasion. In Kent they make two square holes at each end of the floor, and one round in the middle, by means of which they throw the corn out of the upper into the lower rooms, and so up again, to turn and air it the better. Their screens are made with two partitions, to separate the dust from the corn, which falls into a bag, and when sufficiently full this is thrown away, the pure and good corn remaining behind. Corn has by these means been kept in our granaries 30 years; and it is observed, that the longer it is kept the more flour it yields in proportion to the corn, and the purer and whiter the bread is, the superfluous humidity only evaporating in the keeping. At Zurich in Switzerland, they keep corn 80 years, or longer, by the same sort of methods.\n\nThe public granaries at Dantick are seven, eight or nine stories high, having a funnel in the midst of each floor to let down the corn from one to another. They are built so securely, that though every way surrounded with water, the corn contracts no damp, and the vessels have the convenience of coming up to the walls for their lading. The Ruthians preserve their corn in subterranean granaries of the figure of a sugar-loaf, wide below and narrow at top; the sides are well plastered, and the top covered with stones. They are very careful to have the corn well dried before it is laid into these storehouses, and often dry it by means of ovens; the summer dry weather being too short to effect it sufficiently.—Dantick is the grand storehouse or repository of all the fruitful kingdom of Poland. The wheat, barley, and rye, of a great part of the country, are there laid up in parcels of 20, 30, or 60 lasts in a chamber, according to the size of the room; and this they keep turning every day or two, to keep it sweet and fit for shipping. A thunderstorm has sometimes been of very terrible consequences to these stores. All the corn of the growth of former years has been found so much altered by one night's thunder, that though over night it was dry, fit for shipping or keeping, and proper for uses of any sort, yet in the morning it was found clammy and sticking. In this case, there is no remedy but the turning of all such corn two or three times a-day for two months or longer; in which time it will sometimes come to itself, though sometimes not. This effect of thunder and lightning is only observed to take place in such corn as is not a year old, or has not sweated thoroughly in the straw before it was threshed out. The latter inconvenience is easily prevented by a timely care; but as to the former, all that can be done is carefully to examine all stores of the last year's corn after every thunderstorm, that if any of this have been so affected, it may be cured in time; for a neglect of turning will certainly utterly destroy it.\n\nAccording to Vitruvius's rules, a granary should always be at the top of a house, and have its openings only to the north or east, that the corn may not be exposed to the damp winds from the south and west, which are very destructive to it; whereas the contrary ones are very necessary and wholesome to it, serving\nGranary, to cool and dry it from all external humidity, from whatever cause. There must also be openings in the roof to be set open in dry weather, partly to let in fresh air, and partly to let out the warm effluvia which are often emitted by the corn. The covering of the roofs should always be of tiles, because in the worst seasons, when the other openings cannot be safe, there will always be a considerable inlet for fresh air, and a way out for the vapours by their joinings, which are never close. If there happen to be any windows to the south, great care must be taken to shut them up in moist weather, and in the time of the hot southern winds. There must never be a cellar, or any other damp place under a granary, nor should it ever be built over tables; for in either of these cases the corn will certainly suffer by the vapours, and be made damp, in one, and ill tasted in the other.\n\nM. du Hamel and Dr Hales recommend various contrivances for ventilating or blowing fresh air through corn laid up in granaries or ships, in order to preserve it sweet and dry, and to prevent its being devoured by weevils or other insects. This may be done by nailing wooden bars or laths on the floor of the granary about an inch distant from each other, when they are covered with hair-cloth only; or at the distance of two or three inches, when coarse wire-work, or basket-work of osier is laid under the hair cloth, or when an iron plate full of holes is laid upon them. These laths may be laid across other laths, nailed at the distance of 15 inches, and two or more deep, that there may be a free passage for the air under them. The under laths must come about six inches short of the wall of the granary at one end of them; on which end a board is to be set edgewise, and sloping against the wall; by this disposition a large air-pipe is formed, which having an open communication with all the interfaces between and under the bars, will admit the passage of air below forcibly through a hole at the extremity of it, into all the corn in the granary, that will consequently carry off the moist exhalations of the corn. The ventilators for supplying fresh air may be fixed against the wall, on the inside or outside of the granary, or under the floor, or in the ceiling; but wherever they are fixed, the handle of the lever that works them must be out of the granary, otherwise the person who works them would be in danger of suffocation, when the corn is fumigated with burning brimstone, as is sometimes done for destroying weevils. Small moveable ventilators will answer the purpose for ventilating corn in large bins in granaries, and may be easily moved from one bin to another. If the granary or corn ship be very long, the main air-pipe may pass lengthwise along the middle of it, and convey air, on both sides, under the corn. In large granaries, large double ventilators laid on each other, may be fixed at the middle and near the top of the granary, that they may be worked by a wind-mill fixed on the roof of the building, or by a water-mill. The air is to be conveyed from the ventilators through a large trunk or trunks, reaching down through the several floors to the bottom of the granary, with branching trunks to each floor, by means of which the air may be made to pass into a large trunk along the adjoining crofs walls; from these trunks several lesser trunks, about four inches wide, are to branch off, at the distance of three or four feet from each other, which are to reach through the whole length of the granary, and their farther ends are to be closed: seams of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch, are to be left open at the four joinings of the boards, where they are nailed together, that the air may pass through them into the corn. In some of these lesser trunks there may be sliding flutters, in order to stop the passage of the air through those trunks which are not covered with corn; or to ventilate one part of the granary more briskly than others, as there may be occasion. There must also be wooden flutters, hung on hinges at their upper part, so as to shut close of themselves; these must be fixed to the openings in the walls of the granary on their outside: by these means they will readily open to give a free passage for the ventilating air, which ascends through the corn, to pass off; but will instantly shut when the ventilation ceases, and thereby prevent any dampness of the external air from entering: to prevent this, the ventilation should be made only in the middle of dry days, unless the corn, when first put in, is cold and damp.\n\nIn lesser granaries, where the ventilators must be worked by hand, if these granaries stand on staddles, so as to have their lowest floor at some distance from the ground, the ventilators may be fixed under the lowest floor, between the staddles, so as to be worked by men standing on the ground, without or within the granary. A very commodious and cheap ventilator may be made for small granaries, by making a ventilator of the door of the granary; which may be easily done by making a circular screen, of the size of a quarter of a circle, behind the door; but in order to this, the door must be open, not inwards but outwards of the granary, so that as it falls back, it may be worked to and fro in the screen; which must be exactly adapted to it in all parts of the circular side of the screen, as well as at the top and bottom. But there must be a flap at about eight or ten inches distance from the wall, to prevent the door's falling back farther; that there may be room for a valve in the screen to supply it with air; which air will be driven in by the door, through a hole made in the wall near the floor, into the main air-trunk, in which there must be another valve over the hole in the wall, to prevent the return of the air.\n\nTo destroy weevils and other insects with which granaries are apt to be infested.—The preservation of grain from the ravages of insects may be best effected by timely and frequent screening, and ventilation; as little or no inconvenience will follow corn or malt lodged dry, but what evidently results from a neglect of these precautions. For, whether the obvious damage arise from the weevil, the moth, or the beetle, that damage has ceased at the time the vermin make their appearance under either of these species, they being, when in this last state of existence, only propagators of their respective kinds of vermiculi; which, while they continue in that form, do the mischief.\n\nIn this last, or infect state, they eat little, their principal business being to deposit their ova (eggs), which unerring instinct prompts them to do where large collections of grain furnish food for their successors while in a vermicular state. It is therefore the business of industry to prevent future generations of these ravagers, by destroying the eggs previous to their hatching; and\nthis is best accomplished by frequent screening, and exposure to draughts of wind or fresh air. By frequently stirring the grain, the cohesion of their ova is broken, and the nidus of those minute worms is destroyed, which on hatching collect together, and spin or weave numerous nests of a cobweb-like substance for their security. To these nests they attach, by an infinity of small threads, many grains of corn together, first for their protection, and then for their food. When their habitations are broken and separated by the screen, they fall through its small interstices, and may be easily removed from the granary with the dust. Those that escape an early screening will be destroyed by subsequent ones, while the grain is but little injured; and the corn will acquire thereby a superior purity. But by inattention to this, and sometimes by receiving grain already infected into the granary, these vermin, particularly the weevil, will in a short time spread themselves in that state everywhere upon its surface, and darken even the walls by their number. Under such circumstances a hen or hens, with new hatched chickens, if turned on the heap, will traverse, without feeding (or very sparingly so) on the corn, wherever they spread; and are seemingly insatiable in the pursuit of these insects. When the numbers are reduced within reach, a hen will fly up against the walls, and brush them down with her wings, while her chickens seize them with the greatest avidity. This being repeated as often as they want food, the whole species will in a day or two be destroyed. Of the phalena (moth), and the small beetle, they seem equally voracious: on which account they may be deemed the most useful instruments in nature for eradicating these noxious and destructive vermin.\n\nGRANATE, or GARNET, a species of mineral belonging to the filaceous genus. See MINERALOGY Index.\n\nGRANATE-Paste. See GARNET.\n\nGRAND, a term rather French than English, though used on many occasions in our language. It has the same import with great, being formed of the Latin grandis. In this sense we say, the grand-master of an order, the grand-master of Malta, of the free-masons, &c. So also the grand-father, the grand-viril, &c., grand-father, grand-mother, &c.\n\nAmong the French there were formerly several officers thus denominated, which we frequently retain in English; as grand almoner, grand ecuyer, grand chamberlain, grand voyer, &c.\n\nGRAND Affaire. See ASSISE.\n\nGRAND Distrés (districtio magna), in English Law, a writ of distrés, so called on account of its extent, which reaches to all the goods and chattels of the party within the county. This writ lies in two cases: either when the tenant or defendant is attached and appears not, but makes default; or where the tenant or defendant hath once appeared, and after makes default. On such occasions, this writ lies by common law, in lieu of a petit cape.\n\nGRAND GUSTO, among painters, a term used to express that there is something in the picture very great and extraordinary, calculated to surprise, please, and instruct.—Where this is found, they say, the painter was a man of grand gusto; and they use the words sub-\n\ntime and marvellous, when they speak of a picture, in much the same sense.\n\nGRAND Jury, larceny, serjeanty, &c. See JURY, &c.\n\nGRANDEE, is understood of a lord of the first rank or prime quality.\n\nIn Spain, the term grandees is used absolutely to denote the prime lords of the court, to whom the king has once given leave to be covered in his presence: there are some grandees for life only; made by the king's saying simply, Be covered. Others are grandees by descent; made by the king's saying, Be covered for thyself and heirs. These last are reputed far above the former.\n\nThere are some who have three or four grandeeships in their family.\n\nGRANDEUR and SUBLIMITY. These terms have a double signification: they commonly signify the quality or circumstance in objects by which the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are produced; sometimes the emotions themselves.\n\nIn handling the present subject, it is necessary that the impression made on the mind by the magnitude of an object, abstracting from its other qualities, should be ascertained. And because abstraction is a mental operation of some difficulty, the safest method for judging is, to choose a plain object that is neither beautiful nor deformed, if such a one can be found. The plainest that occurs, is a huge mass of rubbish, the ruins perhaps of some extensive building; or a large heap of stones, such as are collected together for keeping in memory a battle or other remarkable event. Such an object, which in miniature would be perfectly indifferent, makes an impression by its magnitude, and appears agreeable. And supposing it so large as to fill the eye, and to prevent the attention from wandering upon other objects, the impression it makes will be so much the deeper. See ATTENTION.\n\nBut though a plain object of that kind be agreeable, it is not termed grand: it is not entitled to that character, unless, together with its size, it be possessed of other qualities that contribute to beauty, such as regularity, proportion, order, or colour: and according to the number of such qualities combined with magnitude, it is more or less grand. Thus St Peter's church at Rome, the great pyramid of Egypt, the Alps towering above the clouds, a great arm of the sea, and above all a clear and serene sky, are grand; because, beside their size, they are beautiful in an eminent degree. On the other hand, an overgrown whale, having a disagreeable appearance, is not grand. A large building agreeable by its regularity and proportions, is grand; and yet a much larger building destitute of regularity, has not the least tincture of grandeur. A single regiment in battle-array, makes a grand appearance; which the surrounding crowd does not, though perhaps ten for one in number. And a regiment where the men are all in one livery, and the horses of one colour, makes a grander appearance, and consequently strikes more terror, than where there is confusion of colour and dress.\n\nThus greatness or magnitude is the circumstance that distinguishes grandeur from beauty; agreeableness is the distinguishing genus, of which beauty and grandeur are species.\n\nThe emotion of grandeur, duly examined, will be found\nGrandeur found an additional proof of the foregoing doctrine.\n\nThat this emotion is pleasanter in a high degree, requires no other evidence but once to have seen a grand object; and if an emotion of grandeur be pleasant, its cause or object, as observed above, must infallibly be agreeable in proportion.\n\nThe qualities of grandeur and beauty are not more distinct than the emotions which these qualities produce in a spectator. It is observed in the article Beauty, that all the various emotions of beauty have one common character, that of sweetness and gaiety. The emotion of grandeur has a different character: a large object that is agreeable, occupies the whole attention, and swells the heart into a vivid emotion, which, though extremely pleasant, is rather serious than gay. And this affords a good reason for distinguishing in language these different emotions. The emotions raised by colour, by regularity, by proportion, and by order, have such a resemblance to each other, as readily to come under one general term, viz. the emotion of beauty; but the emotion of grandeur is so different from those mentioned, as to merit a peculiar name.\n\nThough regularity, proportion, order, and colour, contribute to grandeur as well as to beauty, yet these qualities are not by far so essential to the former as to the latter. To make out that proposition, some preliminaries are requisite. In the first place, the mind, not being totally occupied with a small object, can give its attention at the same time to every minute part; but in a great or extensive object, the mind, being totally occupied with the capital and striking parts, has no attention left for those that are little or indifferent. In the next place, two similar objects appear not similar when viewed at different distances: the similar parts of a very large object, cannot be seen but at different distances; and for that reason, its regularity, and the proportion of its parts, are in some measure lost to the eye; neither are the irregularities of a very large object so conspicuous as of one that is small. Hence it is, that a large object is not so agreeable by its regularity, as a small object; nor so disagreeable by its irregularities.\n\nThese considerations make it evident, that grandeur is satisfied with a less degree of regularity, and of the other qualities mentioned, than is requisite for beauty; which may be illustrated by the following experiment. Approaching to a small conical hill, we take an accurate survey of every part, and are sensible of the slightest deviation from regularity and proportion. Supposing the hill to be considerably enlarged, so as to make us less sensible of its regularity, it will upon that account appear less beautiful. It will not, however, appear less agreeable, because some slight emotion of grandeur comes in place of what is lost in beauty. And at last, when the hill is enlarged to a great mountain, the small degree of beauty that is left, is sunk in its grandeur. Hence it is, that a towering hill is delightful, if it have but the slightest resemblance of a cone; and a chain of mountains not less so, though deficient in the accuracy of order and proportion. We require a small surface to be smooth; but in an extensive plain, considerable inequalities are overlooked. In a word, regularity, proportion, order, and colour, contribute to grandeur as well as to beauty; but with a remarkable difference, that in passing from small to great, they are not required in the same degree of perfection. This remark serves to explain the extreme delight we have in viewing the face of nature, when sufficiently enriched and diversified with objects. The bulk of the objects in a natural landscape are beautiful, and some of them grand: a flowing river, a spreading oak, a round hill, an extended plain, are delightful; and even a rugged rock, or barren heath, though in themselves disagreeable, contribute by contrast to the beauty of the whole: joining to these the verdure of the fields, the mixture of light and shade, and the sublime canopy spread over all, it will not appear wonderful, that so extensive a group of splendid objects should swell the heart to its utmost bounds, and raise the strongest emotion of grandeur. The spectator is conscious of an enthusiasm which cannot bear confinement, nor the strictness of regularity and order: he loves to range at large; and is so enchanted with magnificent objects, as to overlook slight beauties or deformities.\n\nThe same observation is applicable in some measure to works of art. In a small building, the slightest irregularity is disagreeable: but in a magnificent palace, or a large Gothic church, irregularities are less regarded. In an epic poem, we pardon many negligences that would not be permitted in a fonnct or epigram. Notwithstanding such exceptions, it may be justly laid down for a rule, That in works of art, order and regularity ought to be governing principles; and hence the observation of Longinus, \"In works of art we have regard to exact proportion; in those of nature, to grandeur and magnificence.\"\n\nThe same reflections are in a good measure applicable to sublimity: particularly that, like grandeur, it is a species of agreeableness; that a beautiful object placed high, appearing more agreeable than formerly, produces in the spectator a new emotion, termed the emotion of sublimity; and that the perfection of order, regularity, and proportion, is less required in objects placed high, or at a distance, than at hand.\n\nThe pleasant emotion raised by large objects, has not escaped the poets:\n\nHe doth bestride the narrow world\nLike a colossus; and we petty men\nWalk under his huge legs.\n\nJulius Cæsar, act i. sc. 3.\n\nCleopatra. I dreamt there was an emperor Antony:\nOh such another sleep, that I might see\nBut such another man!\nHis face was as the heav'ns: and therein stuck\nA sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted\nThe little O o' th' earth.\nHis legs bestrid the ocean, his rear'd arm\nCrested the world.\n\nAntony and Cleopatra, act v. sc. 3.\n\nMajesty\nDies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw\nWhat's near it with it. It's a maffy wheel\nFix'd on the summit of the highest mount;\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are\nAre mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\nAttends the boit'rous ruin. *Hamlet*, act iii. sc. 8.\n\nThe poets have also made good use of the emotion produced by the elevated situation of an object:\n\n*Quod si me lyricis vatibus inferes,\nSublimi feriam fidera vertice.*\n\n*Horat. Carm.* i. ii. ode 1.\n\nO thou! the earthly author of my blood,\nWhole youthful spirit, in me regenerate,\nDoth with a twofold vigour lift me up,\nTo reach at victory above my head.\n\n*Richard II.*, act i. sc. 4.\n\nNorthumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\nThe mounting Bolinbroke ascends my throne.\n\n*Richard II.*, act v. sc. 2.\n\nAntony. Why was I rais'd the meteor of the world,\nHung in the skies: and blazing as I travell'd,\nTill all my fires were spent; and then cast downward,\nTo be trod out by Caesar?\n\n*Dryden, All for Love*, act i.\n\nThe description of Paradise in the fourth book of Paradise Lost, is a fine illustration of the impression made by elevated objects.\n\nSo on he fares, and to the border comes\nOf Eden, where delicious Paradise,\nNow nearer, crowns with her inclosure green,\nAs with a rural mound, the champain head\nOf a steep wilderness; whose hairy sides\nWith thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,\nAccels deny'd; and over head up grew\nInuperable height of loftiest shade,\nCedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,\nA silvan scene; and as the ranks ascend,\nShade above shade, a woody theatre\nOf stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops\nThe verd'rous wall of Paradise up sprung;\nWhich to our general fire gave prospect large\nInto his nether empire, neighb'ring round,\nAnd higher than that wall a circling row\nOf goodliest trees, loaded with fairest fruit,\nBlooms and fruits at once of golden hue,\nAppear'd, with gay enamell'd colours mix't.\n\nThough a grand object is agreeable, we must not infer that a little object is disagreeable; which would be unhappy for man, considering that he is surrounded with so many objects of that kind. The same holds with respect to place: a body placed high is agreeable; but the same body placed low, is not by that circumstance rendered disagreeable. Littlefolds and lowness of place are precisely similar in the following particular, that they neither give pleasure nor pain. And in this may visibly be discovered peculiar attention in fitting the internal constitution of man to his external circumstances. Were littlefolds and lowness of place agreeable, greatness and elevation could not be so; were littlefolds and lowness of place disagreeable, they would occasion uninterrupted uneasiness.\n\nThe difference between great and little with respect to agreeableness, is remarkably felt in a series when we pass gradually from the one extreme to the other. A mental progress from the capital to the kingdom, from that to Europe—to the whole earth—to the planetary system—to the universe, is extremely pleasant: the heart swells, and the mind is dilated at every step. The returning in an opposite direction is not positively painful, though our pleasure lessens at every step, till it vanishes into indifference: such a progress may sometimes produce pleasure of a different sort, which arises from taking a narrower and narrower inspection. The same observation holds in a progress upward and downward. Ascend is pleasant because it elevates us; but descend is never painful: it is for the most part pleasant from a different cause, that it is according to the order of nature. The fall of a stone from any height, is extremely agreeable by its accelerated motion. We feel it pleasant to descend from a mountain, because the descent is natural and easy. Neither is looking downward painful; on the contrary, to look down upon objects, makes part of the pleasure of elevation: looking down becomes then only painful when the object is so far below as to create dizzines; and even when that is the case, we feel a sort of pleasure mixed with the pain: witness Shakespeare's description of Dover cliffs:\n\nHow fearful\nAnd dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eye so low!\nThe crows and choughs, that wing the midway air,\nShow scarce so grofs as beetles. Half-way down\nHangs one that gathers farnhire; dreadful trade!\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\nAppear like mice; and yon tall anchoring bark\nDiminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\nAlmost too small for sight. The murm'ring surge,\nThat on th' unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,\nCannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,\nLest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\nTopple down headlong. *King Lear*, act iv. sc. 6.\n\nA remark is made above, that the emotions of grandeur and sublimity are nearly allied. And hence it is, that the one term is frequently put for the other: an increasing series of numbers, for example, producing an emotion similar to that of mounting upward, is commonly termed an ascending series: a series of numbers gradually decreasing, producing an emotion similar to that of going downward, is commonly termed a descending series: we talk familiarly of going up to the capital, and of going down to the country: from a lesser kingdom we talk of going up to a greater; whence the ana-basis in the Greek language, when one travels from Greece to Persia. We discover the same way of speaking in the language even of Japan; and its universality proves it the offspring of a natural feeling.\n\nThe foregoing observation leads us to consider Grandeur and sublimity in a figurative sense, and as applicable to the fine arts. Hitherto these terms have been taken in their proper sense as applicable to objects of sight only: and it was of importance to below some pains upon that article: because, generally speaking, the figurative sense of a word is derived from its proper sense, which holds remarkably at present. Beauty\nGrandeur Beauty, in its original signification, is confined to objects of sight; but as many other objects, intellectual as well as moral, raise emotions resembling that of beauty, the resemblance of the effects prompts us to extend the term beauty to these objects. This equally accounts for the terms grandeur and sublimity taken in a figurative sense. Every emotion, from whatever cause proceeding, that resembles an emotion of grandeur or elevation, is called by the same name: thus generosity is said to be an elevated emotion, as well as great courage; and that firmness of soul which is superior to misfortunes obtains the peculiar name of magnanimity. On the other hand, every emotion that contracts the mind, and fixeth it upon things trivial or of no importance, is termed low, by its resemblance to an emotion produced by a little or low object of sight: thus an appetite for trifling amusements is called a low taste. The same terms are applied to characters and actions: we talk familiarly of an elevated genius, of a great man, and equally so of littleness of mind: some actions are great and elevated, and others are little and grovelling. Sentiments, and even expressions, are characterised in the same manner: an expression or sentiment that raises the mind is denominated great or elevated; and hence the sublime in poetry. In such figurative terms, we lose the distinction between great and elevated in their proper sense; for the resemblance is not so entire as to preserve their terms distinct in their figurative application. We carry this figure still farther. Elevation, in its proper sense, imports superiority of place; and townships, inferiority of place; and hence a man of superior talents, of superior rank; of inferior parts, of inferior taste, and such like. The veneration we have for our ancestors, and for the ancients in general, being similar to the emotion produced by an elevated object of sight, justifies the figurative expression of the ancients being raised above us, or possessing a superior place. The notes of the gamut, proceeding regularly from the blunter or groser sounds to the more acute and piercing, produce in the hearer a feeling somewhat similar to what is produced by mounting upward; and this gives occasion to the figurative expressions, a high note, a low note.\n\nSuch is the resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur, that among the nations on the east coast of Africa, who are directed purely by nature, the officers of state are, with respect to rank, distinguished by the length of the baton each carries in his hand; and in Japan, princes and great lords show their rank by the length and size of their sedan-poles. Again, it is a rule in painting, that figures of a small size are proper for grotesque pieces: but that an historical subject, grand and important, requires figures as great as the life. The resemblance of these feelings is in reality so strong, that elevation in a figurative sense is observed to have the same effect, even externally, with real elevation:\n\nK. Henry. This day is call'd the feast of Cripian. He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tiptoe when this day is nam'd, And rouse him at the name of Cripian.\n\nHenry V. act iv. sc. 8.\n\nThe resemblance in feeling between real and figurative grandeur is humorously illustrated by Addison in criticising upon English tragedy. \"The ordinary Spectator method of making an hero is to clap a huge plume of feathers upon his head, which rises so high, that there is often a greater length from his chin to the top of his head than to the sole of his foot. One would believe, that we thought a great man and a tall man the same thing. As these superfluous ornaments upon the head make a great man, a princess generally receives her grandeur from those additional incumbrances that fall into her tail: I mean the broad sweeping train that follows her in all her motions, and finds constant employment for a boy who stands behind her to open and spread it to advantage.\" The Scythians, impressed with the fame of Alexander, were astonished when they found him a little man.\n\nA gradual progress from small to great is not less remarkable in figurative than in real grandeur or elevation. Every one must have observed the delightful effect of a number of thoughts or sentiments, artfully disposed like an ascending series, and making impressions deeper and deeper: such disposition of members in a period is termed a climax.\n\nWithin certain limits grandeur and sublimity produce their strongest effects, which lessen by excess as well as by defect. This is remarkable in grandeur and sublimity taken in their proper sense: the grandest emotion that can be raised by a visible object is where the object can be taken in at one view; if so immense as not to be comprehended but in parts, it tends rather to distract than satisfy the mind (A): in like manner, the strongest emotion produced by elevation is where the object is seen distinctly; a greater elevation lessens in appearance the object, till it vanishes out of sight with its pleasant emotions. The Figurative fame is equally remarkable in figurative grandeur and grandeur-elevation; which shall be handled together, because, as observed above, they are scarcely distinguishable. Sentiments may be so strained as to become obscure, or to exceed the capacity of the human mind: against such licence of imagination, every good writer will be upon his guard. And therefore it is of greater importance to observe, that even the true sublime may be carried beyond that pitch which produces the highest entertainment. We are undoubtedly susceptible of a greater elevation than can be inspired by human actions the most heroic and magnanimous; witness what we feel from Milton's description of superior beings: yet every man must be sensible of a more constant and sweet elevation when the history of his own species is the\n\n(A) It is justly observed by Addison, that perhaps a man would have been more astonished with the majestic air that appeared in one of Lytippus's statues of Alexander, though no bigger than the life, than he might have been with Mount Athos, had it been cut into the figure of the hero, according to the proposal of Phidias, with a river in one hand and a city in the other. Spectator, No 415.\nthe subject: he enjoys an elevation equal to that of the greatest hero, of an Alexander or a Cæsar, of a Brutus or an Epaminondas: he accompanies these heroes in their sublimest sentiments and most hazardous exploits, with a magnanimity equal to theirs; and finds it no stretch to preserve the same tone of mind for hours together without flinching. The case is not the same in describing the actions or qualities of superior beings: the reader's imagination cannot keep pace with that of the poet; the mind, unable to support itself in a strained elevation, falls as from a height; and the fall is inimodrate like the elevation: where that effect is not felt, it must be prevented by some obscurity in the conception, which frequently attends the descriptions of unknown objects. Hence the St Francis, St Dominics, and other tutelary saints among the Roman Catholics. A mind unable to raise itself to the Supreme Being self-existent and eternal, or to support itself in a strained elevation, finds itself more at ease in using the intercession of some faint whole piety and penances while on earth are supposed to have made him a favourite in heaven.\n\nA strained elevation is attended with another inconvenience, that the author is apt to fall suddenly as well as the reader; because it is not a little difficult to descend, sweetly and easily, from such elevation to the ordinary tone of the subject. The following passage is a good illustration of that observation:\n\n*Saepe etiam immensus coelo venit agmen aquarum,\nEt fecdam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris\nColleget ex alto nubes. Ruit ardus aether,\nEt pluvia ingenti fata lucta, bonoque labores\nDiluit. Implentur fossae, et cava flumina crescunt\nCum fonte, fervetque freis spirantibus æquor.\nIpse Pater, media nimborum in nocte, coruca\nFulmina molitur dextra. Quo maxima motu\nTerra tremit: fugere fere, et mortalia corda\nPer gentes humilis stravit pavor. Ille flagrant\nAut Atho, aut Rhodopen, aut alta Ceraunia telo\nDejicit: ingeminant Aupiri, et densiflumus imber.*\n\n*Virg. Georg. i. 322.*\n\nIn the description of a storm, to figure Jupiter throwing down huge mountains with his thunderbolts, is hyperbolically sublime, if we may use the expression: the tone of mind produced by that image is so distant from the tone produced by a thick shower of rain, that the sudden transition must be unpleasant.\n\nObjects of sight that are not remarkably great nor high, scarce raise any emotion of grandeur or of sublimity: and the same holds in other objects; for we often find the mind roused and animated, without being carried to that height. This difference may be discerned in many sorts of music, as well as in some musical instruments: a kettle-drum roules, and a hautboy is animating; but neither of them inspires an emotion of sublimity: revenge animates the mind in a considerable degree; but it never produceth an emotion that can be termed grand or sublime; and perhaps no disagreeable passion ever has that effect.\n\nNo desire is more universal than to be exalted and honoured; and upon that account, chiefly, are we ambitious of power, riches, titles, fame, which would suddenly lose their relish did they not raise us above others, and command submission and deference: and it may be thought, that our attachment to things grand and lofty, proceeds from their connection with our favourite passion. This connection has undoubtedly an effect; but that the preference given to things grand and lofty must have a deeper root in human nature, will appear from considering, that many bestow their time upon low and trifling amusements, without having the least tincture of this favourite passion: yet these very persons talk the same language with the rest of mankind; and prefer the more elevated pleasures: they acknowledge a more refined taste, and are ashamed of their own as low and grovelling. This sentiment, constant and universal, must be the work of nature; and it plainly indicates an original attachment in human nature to every object that elevates the mind: some men may have a greater relish for an object not of the highest rank; but they are conscious of the preference given by mankind in general to things grand and sublime, and they are sensible that their peculiar taste ought to yield to the general taste.\n\nWhat is said above suggests a capital rule for reaching the sublime in such works of art as are susceptible of it; and that is, to present those parts or circumstances only which make the greatest figure, of manner, keeping out of view every thing low or trivial; for the mind, elevated by an important object, cannot, without reluctance, be forced down to bestow any share of its attention upon trifles. Such judicious selection of capital circumstances, is by an eminent critic styled *grandeur de maniere*. In none of the fine arts is there so great scope for that rule as in poetry; which, by that means, enjoys a remarkable power of bestowing upon objects and events an air of grandeur: when we are spectators, every minute object presents itself in its order; but in describing at second hand, these are laid aside, and the capital objects are brought close together. A judicious taste in thus selecting the most interesting incidents, to give them an united force, accounts for a fact that may appear surprising; which is, that we are more moved by spirited narrative at second hand, than by being spectators of the event itself, in all its circumstances.\n\nLonginus exemplifies the foregoing rule by a comparison of two passages.\n\n*Ye pow'rs, what madness! how on ships so frail\n(Tremendous thought!) can thoughtless mortals fail?\nFor stormy seas they quit the pleasing plain,\nPlant woods in waves, and dwell amidst the main.\nFar o'er the deep (a trackless path) they go,\nAnd wander oceans in pursuit of woe.\nNo safe their hearts, no rest their eyes can find,\nOn heaven their looks, and on the waves their mind;\nSunk are their spirits, while their arms they rear,\nAnd gods are wearied with their fruitless prayer.*\n\n*Aristæus.*\n\nBurst as a wave that from the cloud impends,\nAnd swell'd with tempests on the ship descends.\nWhite are the decks with foam: the winds aloud\nHowl o'er the masts, and ring through every throud.\nPale, trembling, tir'd, the sailors freeze with fears,\nAnd instant death on every wave appears.*\nIn the latter passage, the most striking circumstances are selected to fill the mind with terror and astonishment. The former is a collection of minute and low circumstances, which scatter the thought, and make no impression: it is at the same time full of verbal antitheses and low conceit, extremely improper in a scene of distress.\n\nThe following description of a battle is remarkably sublime, by collecting together, in the fewest words, those circumstances which make the greatest figure.\n\n\"Like autumn's dark storms pouring from two echoing hills, toward each other approached the heroes; as two dark streams from high rocks meet and roar on the plain, loud, rough, and dark in battle, meet Lochlin and Inisfail. Chief mixes his strokes with chief, and man with man: steel sounds on steel, and helmets are cleft on high: blood bursts and smokes around; strings murmur on the polished yew: darts rush along the sky: spears fall like sparks of flame that gild the stormy face of night.\n\n\"As the noise of the troubled ocean when roll the waves on high, as the last peal of thundering heaven, such is the noise of battle. Though Cormac's hundred bards were there, feeble were the voice of a hundred bards to send the deaths to future times; for many were the deaths of the heroes, and wide poured the blood of the valiant.\" Fingal.\n\nThe following passage in the 4th book of the Iliad is a description of a battle wonderfully ardent.\n\n\"When now gathered on either side, the host plunged together in fight; shield is harshly laid to shield; spears clash on the brazen corsets; boffy buckler with buckler meets; loud tumult rages over all; groans are mixed with boasts of men; the slain and slayer join in noise; the earth is floating round with blood. As when two rushing streams from two mountains come roaring down, and throw together their rapid waters below, they roar along the gulphy vale; the startled shepherd hears the sound as he stalks o'er the distant hills: so, as they mixed in fight, from both armies clamour with loud terror arose.\" But such general descriptions are not frequent in Homer. Even his single combats are rare. The fifth book is the longest account of a battle that is in the Iliad; and yet contains nothing but a long catalogue of chiefs killing chiefs, not in single combat neither, but at a distance with an arrow or a javelin; and these chiefs named for the first time and the last. The same scene is continued through a great part of the fifth book. There is at the same time a minute description of every wound, which for accuracy may do honour to an anatomist, but in an epic poem is tiresome and fatiguing. There is no relief from horrid languor, but the beautiful Greek language and melody of Homer's verification.\n\nIn the twenty-first book of the Odyssey, there is a passage which deviates widely from the rule above laid down: it concerns that part of the history of Penelope and her suitors, in which she is made to declare in favour of him who should prove the most dexterous in shooting with the bow of Ulysses:\n\nNow gently winding up the fair ascent,\nBy many an easy step the matron went:\nVol. X. Part I.\n\nThen o'er the pavements glides with grace divine\n(With polish'd oak the level pavements shine).\nThe folding gates a dazzling light display'd,\nWith pomp of various architrave o'erlaid.\nThe bolt, obedient to the silken string,\nForsakes the staple as the pulls the ring;\nThe wards respondant to the key turn round;\nThe bars fall back; the flying valves resound.\nLoud as a bull makes hill and valley ring,\nSo roar'd the lock when it releas'd the spring.\nShe moves majestic through the wealthy room,\nWhere treasur'd garments cast a rich perfume:\nThere, from the column where aloft it hung,\nReach'd, in its splendid case, the bow unstrung.\n\nVirgil sometimes errs against this rule; in the following passages minute circumstances are brought into full view; and what is still worse, they are described with all the pomp of poetical diction, Aeneid, lib. i. l. 214, to 219. lib. vi. l. 176, to 182. lib. vi. l. 212, to 231: and the last, which describes a funeral, is the least excusable, as the man whose funeral it is makes no figure in the poem.\n\nThe speech of Clytemnestra, descending from her chariot, in the Iphigenia of Euripides *, is stuffed with *Act iii., a number of common and trivial circumstances.\n\nBut of all writers, Lucan in this article is the most injudicious: the sea-fight between the Romans and Massilians + is described so much in detail, without Lib. iii., exhibiting any grand or total view, that the reader is so fatigued with endless circumstances, without ever feeling any degree of elevation; and yet there are some fine incidents, those, for example, of the two brothers, and of the old man and his son, which, taken separately, would affect us greatly. But Lucan, once engaged in a description, knows no end. See other passages of the same kind, lib. iv. l. 292, to 337. lib. iv. l. 759, to 765. The episode of the sorcerer Eriotho, end of book sixth, is intolerably minute and prolix.\n\nThis rule is also applicable to other fine arts. In painting it is established, that the principal figure must be put in the strongest light; that the beauty of attitude consists in placing the nobler parts most in view, and in suppressing the smaller parts as much as possible; that the folds of the drapery must be few and large; that foreshortenings are bad, because they make the parts appear little; and that the muscles ought to be kept as entire as possible, without being divided into small sections. Every one at present subscribes to that rule as applied to gardening, in opposition to parterres split into a thousand small parts in the stiffest regularity of figure. The most eminent architects have governed themselves by the same rule in all their works.\n\nAnother rule chiefly regards the sublime, though it General is applicable to every sort of literary performance intended for amusement: and that is, to avoid as much as possible abstract and general terms. Such terms, (sublimity is similar to mathematical signs, are contrived to express intended our thoughts in a concise manner; but images, which are the life of poetry, cannot be raised in any perfection but by introducing particular objects. General terms, that comprehend a number of individuals, must be excepted from that rule: our kindred, our clan, our country, and words of the like import, though they scarce\nGrandeur scarce raise any image, have, however, a wonderful power over the passions: the greatness of the complex object overbalances the obliquity of the image.\n\nGrandeur, being an extremely vivid emotion, is not readily produced in perfection but by reiterated impressions. The effect of a single impression can be but momentary; and if one feel suddenly somewhat like a swelling or exaltation of mind, the emotion vanishes as soon as felt. Single thoughts or sentiments are often cited as examples of the sublime; but their effect is far inferior to that of a grand subject displayed in its capital parts. We shall give a few examples, that the reader may judge for himself. In the famous action of Thermopylae, where Leonidas the Spartan king, with his chosen band, fighting for their country, were cut off to the last man, a saying is reported of Dieneces, one of the band, which, expressing cheerful and undisturbed bravery, is well entitled to the first place in examples of that kind: talking of the number of their enemies, it was observed, that the arrows shot by such a multitude would intercept the light of the sun; \"So much the better (says he), for we shall then fight in the shade.\"\n\nSomerfet. Ah! Warwick, Warwick, wert thou as we are,\nWe might recover all our loss again.\nThe Queen from France hath brought a puissant power.\nEv'n now we heard the news. Ah! couldst thou fly!\nWarwick. Why, then I would not fly.\n\nThird part, Henry VI. act v. sc. 3.\n\nSuch a sentiment from a man expiring of his wounds, is truly heroic; and must elevate the mind to the greatest height that can be done by a single expression; it will not suffer in a comparison with the famous sentiment Qui mourut of Corneille: the latter is a sentiment of indignation merely, the former of firm and cheerful courage.\n\nTo cite in opposition many a sublime passage, enriched with the finest images, and dressed in the most nervous expressions, would scarce be fair. We shall produce but one instance, from Shakespeare, which sets a few objects before the eye, without much pomp of language: it operates its effect by representing these objects in a climax, raising the mind higher and higher till it feel the emotion of grandeur in perfection:\n\nThe cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, &c.\n\nThe cloud-capt tow'rs produce an elevating emotion, heightened by the gorgeous palaces; and the mind is carried still higher and higher by the images that follow. Successive images, making thus stronger and stronger impressions, must elevate more than any single image can do.\n\nAs, on the one hand, no means directly applied have more influence to raise the mind than grandeur and sublimity; so, on the other, no means indirectly applied have more influence to sink and depress it: for in a state of elevation, the artful introduction of an humbling object, makes the fall great in proportion to the elevation. Of this observation Shakespeare gives a beautiful example in the passage last quoted:\n\nThe cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces,\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\nAnd like the baseless fabric of a vision\nLeave not a wreck behind—Tempo, act iv. sc. 4.\n\nThe elevation of the mind in the former part of this beautiful passage, makes the fall great in proportion, when the most humbling of all images is introduced, that of an utter dissolution of the earth and its inhabitants. The mind, when warmed, is more susceptible of impressions than in a cool state; and a depressing or melancholy object listened to, makes the strongest impression when it reaches the mind in its highest state of elevation or cheerfulness.\n\nBut a humbling image is not always necessary to produce that effect: a remark is made above, that in describing superior beings, the reader's imagination, unable to support itself in a strained elevation, falls often as from a height, and sinks even below its ordinary tone. The following instance comes luckily in view; for a better cannot be given: \"God said, Let there be light, and there was light.\" Longinus quotes this passage from Moses as a shining example of the sublime; and it is scarce possible, in fewer words, to convey so clear an image of the infinite power of the Deity: but then it belongs to the present subject to remark, that the emotion of sublimity raised by this image is but momentary; and that the mind, unable to support itself in an elevation so much above nature, immediately sinks down into humility and veneration for a Being so far exalted above grovelling mortals. Every one is acquainted with a dispute about that passage between two French critics*, the one positively affirming it to be sublime, the other as positively denying. What has been remarked, shows, that both of them have reached the truth, but neither of them the whole truth: the primary effect of the passage is undoubtedly an emotion of grandeur; which so far justifies Boileau: but then every one must be sensible, that the emotion is merely a flash, which, vanishing instantaneously, gives way to humility and veneration. That indirect effect of sublimity justifies Huet, on the other hand, who being a man of true piety, and probably not much carried by imagination, felt the humbling passions more sensibly than his antagonist did. And laying aside difference of character, Huet's opinion may perhaps be defended as the more solid; because, in such images, the depressing emotions are the more sensibly felt, and have the longer endurance.\n\nThe straining an elevated subject beyond due bounds, false sublime and beyond the reach of an ordinary conception, is a vice so frequent as to require the correction of criticism. But false sublime is a rock that writers of more fire than judgment commonly split on; and therefore a collection of examples may be of use as a beacon to future adventurers. One species of false sublime, known by the name of bombast, is common among writers of a mean genius: it is a ferious endeavour, by strained description, to raise a low or familiar subject above its rank; which, instead of being sublime, fails not to be ridiculous. The mind, indeed, is extremely prone, in some animating passions, to magnify its objects.\nAn actor on the stage may be guilty of bombast as Grandeur does beyond natural bounds: but such hyperbolical description has its limits; and when carried beyond the impulse of the propensity, it degenerates into burlesque. Take the following examples:\n\n**Sejanus.**\n\nGreat and high\nThe world knows only two, that's Rome and I.\nMy roof receives me not: 'tis air I tread,\nAnd at each step I feel my advanc'd head\nKnock out a star in heav'n.\n\n**Ben Johnson, Sejanus, act v.**\n\nA writer who has no natural elevation of mind deviates readily into bombast: he strains above his natural powers; and the violent effort carries him beyond the bounds of propriety.\n\n**Guildford.**\n\nGive way, and let the gushing torrent come;\nBehold the tears we bring to swell the deluge,\nTill the flood rise upon the guilty world,\nAnd make the ruin common.\n\n**Lady Jane Grey, act iv. near the end.**\n\nAnother species of false sublime is still more faulty than bombast; and that is, to force elevation by introducing imaginary beings without preserving any propriety in their actions; as if it were lawful to ascribe every extravagance and inconsistence to beings of the poet's creation. No writers are more licentious in that article than Johnson and Dryden.\n\nMethinks I see Death and the Furies waiting\nWhat we will do, and all the heaven at leisure\nFor the great spectacle. Draw then your swords:\nAnd if our destiny envy our virtue\nThe honour of the day, yet let us care\nTo fell ourselves at such a price, as may\nUndo the world to buy us, and make Fate,\nWhile she tempts ours, to fear her own estate.\n\n**Catiline, act v.**\n\nThe Furies stood on hills\nCircling the place, and trembled to see men\nDo more than they: whilst Piety left the field,\nGriev'd for that side, that in so bad a cause\nThey knew not what a crime their valour was.\nThe sun stood still, and was, behind the cloud\nThe battle made, seen sweating to drive up\nHis frighted horse, whom still the noise drove backwards.\n\n**Ibid. act v.**\n\nOf myn. While we indulge our common happiness,\nHe is forget by whom we all poise,\nThe brave Almanzor, to whose arms we owe\nAll that we did, and all that we shall do;\nWho like a tempest that outrides the wind,\nMade a just battle ere the bodies join'd.\n\n**Adalla.** His victories we scarce could keep in view,\nOr polish 'em so fast as he rough drew.\n\n**Abdemelech.** Fate after him below with pain did move,\nAnd Victory could scarce keep pace above.\nDeath did at length so many slain forget,\nAnd lost the tale, and took 'em by the great.\n\n**Conquest of Granada, act ii. at beginning.**\n\nGRANDGOR is used in Scotland for the pox. In the Philosophical Transactions, no. 469, sect. 5, we have a proclamation of King James IV. of Scotland, ordering all who had this disease, or who had attended others under it, forthwith to repair to an island in the firth of Forth. If the grandgor was the pox, and this distemper came into Europe at the siege of Naples in 1495, it must have made a very quick progress to cause such an alarm at Edinburgh in 1497.\n\n**Grange,** an ancient term for a barn or place wherein to lay up and thresh corn. The word is formed of the Latin *granum,* or of *granum,* \"grain, corn,\" &c. Hence also *granger* or *granger,* \"a grange-keeper or farmer.\"\n\n**Grange** is also used, in a more extensive sense, for a whole farm, with all the appendages of stables for horses, stalls for cattle, &c., and for an inn.\n\n**Grani,** in our ancient writers, mustaches or whiskers of a beard. The word seems formed from the ancient British or Irish *greann,* \"a beard.\" It is given for a reason why the cup is refused to the laity, *Quia barbati, & prolixos habent granos, dum poculum inter epulas sumunt, prius liquore pilos inficiunt, quam ori infundunt.*\n\n**Granicus,** a small river near the Hellespont in Lesser Asia, remarkable for the first victory gained by Alexander the Great over the armies of Darius.—Authors disagree very much about the number of the Persians, though all agree that they were vastly more numerous than the Greeks. Justin and Orosius tell us, that the Persian army consisted of 600,000 foot and 20,000 horse; Arian makes the foot amount to 200,000; but Diodorus tells us, that they were not more than 100,000 foot and 10,000 horse. The Macedonian army did not exceed 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. The Persian cavalry lined the banks of the Granicus, in order to oppose Alexander wherever he should attempt a passage; and the foot were posted behind the cavalry on an easy ascent. Parmenio would have had Alexander allow his troops some time to refresh themselves; but he replied, that after having crossed the Hellespont, it would be a disgrace to him and his troops to be stopped by a rivulet. Accordingly a proper place for crossing the river was no sooner found, than he commanded a strong detachment of horse to enter; he himself followed with the right wing, which he commanded in person; the trumpets in the mean time sounding, and loud shouts of joy being heard through the whole army. The Persians let fly such showers of arrows against the detachment of Macedonian horse as caused some confusion; several of their horses being killed or wounded. As they drew near the bank a most bloody engagement ensued; the Macedonians attempting to land, and the Persians pushing them back into the river. Alexander, who observed the confusion they were in, took the command of them himself; and landing in spite of all opposition, obliged the Persian cavalry, after an obstinate resistance,\nrefusal, to give ground. However, Spithrobes, governor of Ionia, and son-in-law to Darius, still maintained his ground, and did all that lay in his power to bring them back to the charge. Alexander advanced full gallop to engage him; neither did he decline the combat, and both were slightly wounded at the first encounter. Spithrobes having thrown his javelin without effect, advanced sword in hand to meet his antagonist, who ran him through with his pike as he raised his arm to discharge a blow with his scimitar. But Rofaces, brother to Spithrobes, at the same time gave Alexander such a furious blow on the head with his battle-ax, that he beat off his plume, and slightly wounded him through the helmet. As he was ready to repeat the blow, Clitus with one stroke of his scimitar cut off Rofaces's head, and thus in all probability saved the life of his sovereign. The Macedonians then, animated by the example of their king, attacked the Persians with new vigour, who soon after betook themselves to flight. Alexander did not pursue them; but immediately charged the enemy's foot with all his forces, who had now passed the river. The Persians, disheartened at the defeat of their cavalry, made no great resistance. The Greek mercenaries retired in good order to a neighbouring hill, whence they sent deputies to Alexander, desiring leave to march off unmolested. But he, instead of coming to a parley with them, rushed furiously into the middle of this small body, where his horse was killed under him, and he himself in great danger of being cut in pieces. The Greeks defended themselves with incredible valour for a long time, but were at last almost entirely cut off. In this battle the Persians are said to have lost 20,000 foot and 2,500 horse, and the Macedonians only 55 foot and 60 horse.\n\nGRANITE, a compound rock which is considered as one of the oldest of which the earth is composed. See GEOLOGY and MINERALOGY Index.\n\nGRANITE, a kind of rock, belonging to the compound stones. It is composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica, in variable proportions. See MINERALOGY and GEOLOGY Index.\n\nGRANITILLO, or GRANITEL, a name given by some mineralogists to a particular species or variety of granite.\n\nGRANIVOROUS, an appellation given to animals which feed on corn or seeds. These are principally of the bird kind.\n\nGRANT, in Law, a conveyance in writing of such things as cannot pass or be conveyed by word only; such are rents, reversions, services, &c.\n\nGRANT, Francis, Lord Cullen, an eminent lawyer and judge in Scotland, was descended from a younger branch of the family of the Grants of Grant in that kingdom, and was born about the year 1660. When he commenced advocate, he made a distinguished figure at the revolution, by opposing the opinion of the old lawyers, who warmly argued on the inability of the convention of estates to make any disposition of the crown. The abilities which he discovered in favour of the revolution introduced him to extensive practice; in which he acquired so much reputation, that when the union between the two kingdoms was in agitation, Queen Anne, without solicitation, created him a baronet, with a view of securing his interest in that measure; and upon the same principle, she soon after created him a judge, or one of the lords of session. From this time, according to the custom of Scotland, he was styled, from the name of his estate, Lord Cullen: and the same good qualities that recommended him to this honourable office, were very conspicuous in the discharge of it; which he continued for 20 years with the highest reputation, when a period was put to his life by an illness which lasted but three days. He died March 16th, 1726. His character is drawn to great advantage in the Biographia Britannica; where it is observed, among other remarks to his honour, \"That as an advocate he was indefatigable in the management of business; but at the same time that he spared no pains, he would use no craft. He had so high an idea of the dignity of his profession, that he held it equally criminal to neglect any honest means of coming to justice, or to make use of any arts to elude it. In respect to fortune, though he was modest and frugal, and had a large practice, yet he was far from being avaricious. His private charities were very considerable, and grew in the same proportion with his profits. He was, besides, very scrupulous in many points; he would not suffer a just cause to be lost through a client's want of money. He was such an enemy to oppression, that he never denied his assistance to such as laboured under it; and with respect to the clergy of all professions (in Scotland), his conscience obliged him to serve them without a fee. When this merit had raised him to the bench, he thought himself accountable to God and man for his conduct in that high office: and that deep sense of his duty, at the same time that it kept him strictly to it, encouraged and supported him in the performance. Whenever he sat as lord ordinary, the paper of causes was remarkably full; for his reputation being equally established for knowledge and integrity, there were none, who had a good opinion of their own pretensions, but were delirious of bringing them before him, and not many who did not sit down satisfied with his decision. This prevailed more especially after it was found that few of his sentences were reversed; and when they were, it was commonly owing to himself: for if, upon mature reflection, or upon new reasons offered at the re-hearing, he saw any just ground for altering his judgment, he made no scruple of declaring it; being persuaded that it was more manly, as well as more just, to follow truth, than to support opinion: and his conduct in this respect had a right effect; for instead of lessening, it raised his reputation. He would not, however, with all this great stock of knowledge, experience, and probity, trust himself in matters of blood, or venture to decide in criminal cases on the lives of his fellow-creatures; which was the reason that, though often solicited, he could never be prevailed upon to accept of a seat in the judiciary court.—In his private character he was as amiable as he was respectable in his public. He was charitable without ostentation, disinterested in his friendships, and beneficent to all who had any thing to do with him. He was not only strictly just; but to free from any species of avarice, that his lady, who was a woman of great prudence and discretion, finding him more intent on the business committed to him by others than on his own, took upon herself the care of placing out his mo-\nGranville, nay; and to prevent his postponing, as he was apt to do, such kind of affairs, when securities offered, the cau- fed the circumstances of them to be stated in the form of cases, and so procured his opinion upon his own concerns as if they had been those of a client. He was so true a lover of learning, and was so much ad- dicted to his studies, that notwithstanding the multi- plicity of his business while at the bar, and his great attention to his charge when a judge, he nevertheless found time to write various treatises on very different and important subjects: Some political, which were remarkably well timed, and highly serviceable to the government: others of a most extensive nature, such as his essays on law, religion, and education, which were dedicated to George II. when prince of Wales; by whose command, his then secretary, Mr Samuel Mo- lyneaux, wrote him a letter of thanks, in which were many gracious expressions, as well in relation to the piece as to its author. He composed, besides these, many discourses on literary subjects, for the exercise of his own thoughts, and for the better discovery of truth: which went no farther than his own closet, and from a principle of modesty were not communicated even to his most intimate friends.\"\n\nGRANTHAM, a town of Lincolnshire, 110 miles from London, situated on the river Witham. It is sup- posed to have been a Roman town by the remains of a castle which have been formerly dug up here. It is governed by an alderman and 12 justices of the peace, a recorder, a coroner, &c. Here is a fine large church with a stone spire, one of the loftiest in England, being 288 feet high, and, by the deception of the sight, seems to stand away, which, by the church being situated too low, appears to a very great disadvantage. Here is a good free-school, where Sir Isaac Newton received his first education, besides two charity- schools.\n\nGRANVILLE, GEORGE, Lord Lansdowne, was descended from a very ancient family, derived from Rollo the first duke of Normandy. At eleven years of age he was sent to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he remained five years: but at the age of 13 was admitted to the degree of master of arts; having, before he was 12, spoken a copy of verses of his own composition to the duchess of York at his college, when she paid a visit to the University of Cambridge. In 1696, his comedy called the She-gallants was acted at the theatre-royal in Lincoln's-inn-fields, as his tragedy called Heroic Love was in the year 1698. In 1702 he translated into English the second Olymian of Democritus. He was member for the county of Cornwall in the parliament which met in 1710; was afterwards secretary of war, comptroller of the household, then treasurer, and sworn one of the privy council. The year following, he was created Baron Lansdowne. On the accession of King George I. in 1714, he was removed from his treasurer's place; and the next year entered his protest against the bills for attainting Lord Bolingbroke and the duke of Ormond. He entered deeply into the scheme for raising an insurrection in the west of England; and being seized as a suspected person, was committed to the Tower, where he continued two years. In 1719, he made a speech in the house of lords, against the bill to prevent occasional conformity. In 1722, he withdrew to France, and continued abroad almost ten years. At his return in 1732, he published Granville a fine edition of his works in 2 vols quarto. He died in 1735, leaving no male issue.\n\nGRANVILLE, a sea-port town of France, in Lower Normandy, partly seated on a rock and partly on a plain. It gave title to an English earl, now extinct. W. Long, i. 32. N. Lat. 48° 58'.\n\nGRANULATED, something that has undergone granulation, or has been reduced to grains.\n\nGRANULATION, in Chemistry, an operation by which metallic substances are reduced into small grains, or roundish particles; the use of which is, to facilitate their combination with other substances.—This operation is very simple; it consists only in pouring a melted metal slowly into a vessel filled with water, which is in the mean time to be agitated with a broom. Lead or tin may be granulated by pouring them when melted into a box; the internal surface of which is to be rubbed with powdered chalk, and the box strongly shaken till the lead has become solid. Metals are granulated, because their ductility renders them incapable of being pounded, and because filing is long and tedious, and might render the metal impure by an admixture of iron from the file.\n\nGRAPE, the fruit of the vine. See VINE and WINE. See also Currant and RAISIN.\n\nGRAPE-Shot, in artillery, is a combination of small shot, put into a thick canvas bag, and corded strongly together, so as to form a kind of cylinder, whose diameter is equal to that of the ball adapted to the cannon. The number of shot in a grape varies according to the service or size of the guns: in sea-service nine is always the number; but by land it is increased to any number or size, from an ounce and a quarter in weight to three or four pounds. In sea-service the bottoms and pins are made of iron, whereas those used by land are of wood.\n\nGRAPES, in the manege, a term used to signify the arrefts or mangy tumours that happen in the horse's legs.\n\nGRAPHOMETER, a mathematical instrument, otherwise called a semicircle; the use of which is to observe any angle whose vertex is at the centre of the instrument in any plane (though it is most commonly horizontal, or nearly so), and to find how many degrees it contains. See Mensuration.\n\nGRAPNEL, or GRAPPLING, a sort of small anchor, fitted with four or five flukes or claws, and commonly used to ride a boat or other small vessel.\n\nFire-GRAPPLING, an instrument nearly resembling the former, but differing in the construction of its flukes, which are furnished with strong bars on their points. These machines are usually fixed on the yard-arms of a ship, in order to grapple any adversary whom she intends to board. They are, however, more particularly useful in Fire Ships for the purposes described in that article.\n\nGRASS, in Botany, a plant having simple leaves, a stem generally jointed and tubular, a husky calyx (called gluma), and the seed single. For the classification of grasses, see Botany Index; and for an account of the culture, see Agriculture Index.\n\nGRASSHOPPER, a species of gryllus. See Gryllus, Entomology Index.\n\nGRATES for Fires, are composed of ribs of iron placed...\nplaced at small distances from one another, so that the air may have sufficient access to the fuel, and the accumulation of the ashes, which would choke the fire, may be prevented.—Grates seem peculiarly adapted to the use of pit-coal, which requires a greater quantity of air to make it burn freely than other kinds of fuel. The hearths of the Britons seem to have been fixed in the centre of their halls, as is yet practised in some parts of Scotland, where the fire is nearly in the middle of the house, and the family sit all around it. Their fire-place was perhaps nothing more than a large stone, depressed a little below the level of the ground, and thereby adapted to receive the ashes. About a century ago, it was only the floor of the room, with the addition of a bauk or hob of clay. But it was now changed among the gentlemen for a portable firespan, raised upon low supports, and fitted with a circular grating of bars. Such were in use among the Gauls in the first century, and among the Welsh in the tenth.\n\nGRATIAN, the son of Valentinian I. by his first wife, was declared Augustus by his father at the city of Amiens in 365, and succeeded him in 367; a prince equally extolled for his wit, eloquence, modesty, chastity, and zeal against heretics. He associated Theodosius with him in the empire, and advanced the poet Ausonius to the consulate. He made a great slaughter of the Germans at Strasbourg *, and hence was surnamed Alemannicus. He was the first emperor who refused the title of Pontifex Maximus, upon the score of its being a Pagan dignity. He was assassinated by Andragathius in 375, in the 24th year of his age.\n\nGRATIAN, a famous Benedictine monk, in the 12th century, was born at Chiusi in Tuscany, and employed above 24 years in composing a work, entitled Decretum, or Concordantia Discordantium Canonum, because he there endeavoured to reconcile the canons which seemed contradictory to each other. This work was first printed at Mentz in 1472. As he is frequently mistaken, in taking one canon of one council, or one passage of one father for another, and has often cited false decretals, several authors have endeavoured to correct his faults; and chiefly Anthony Augustine, in his excellent work, entitled De emendatione Gratiani. To the decretals of Gratian, the popes principally owed the great authority they exercised in the 13th and following centuries.\n\nGRATINGS, in a ship, are small edges of sawed plank, framed one into another like a lattice or prison grate, lying on the upper deck, between the mainmast and foremast, serving for a defence in a close fight, and also for the coolness, light, and convenience of the ship's company.\n\nGRATIOLA, hedge hyssop; a genus of plants belonging to the diandria clas. See BOTANY Index.\n\nGRATITUDE, in Ethics, a virtue disposing the mind to an inward sense and outward acknowledgment of benefits received.\n\nExamples of ingratitude, Mr Paley observes, check and discourage voluntary beneficence; hence the cultivation of a grateful temper is a consideration of public importance. A second reason for cultivating in ourselves that temper is: That the same principle which is touched with the kindness of a human benefactor, is capable of being affected by the divine goodness, and of becoming, under the influence of that affection, Gratitude, a source of the purest and most exalted virtue. The love of God is the sublimest gratitude. It is a mistake, therefore, to imagine, that this virtue is omitted in the Scriptures; for every precept which commands us \"to love God, because he first loved us,\" presupposes the principle of gratitude, and directs it to its proper object.\n\nIt is impossible to particularise the several expressions of gratitude, which vary with the character and situation of the benefactor, and with the opportunities of the person obliged; for this variety admits of no bounds. It may be observed, however, that on one part gratitude can never oblige a man to do what is wrong, and what by consequence he is previously obliged not to do: On the other part, it argues a total want of every generous principle, as well as of moral probity, to take advantage of that ascendency, which the conferring of benefits justly creates, to draw or drive those whom we have obliged into mean or dishonest compliances.\n\nThe following pleasing example of genuine gratitude is extracted from Hackwood's Apol. lib. xiv. c. io. p. 436. —Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant descended of a noble family in Italy, had gained a plentiful fortune, of which he was liberal-handed to all in necessity; which being well known to others, though concealed by himself, a young stranger applied to him for charity. Signior Frescobald, seeing something in his countenance more than ordinary, overlooked his tattered clothes; and compassionating his circumstances, asked him \"What he was, and of what country?\" \"I am (answered the young man) a native of England; my name is Thomas Cromwell, and my father-in-law is a poor sheerman. I left my country to seek my fortune; came with the French army that were routed at Gatlyon, where I was a page to a footman, and carried his pike and burgonet after him.\" Frescobald commiserating his necessities, and having a particular respect for the English nation, clothed him gently; took him into his house till he had recovered strength by better diet; and, at his taking leave, mounted him upon a good horse, with 16 ducats of gold in his pockets. Cromwell expressed his thankfulness in a very sensible manner, and returned by land towards England; where, being arrived, he was preferred into the service of Cardinal Wolsey. After the cardinal's death, he worked himself effectually into the favour of King Henry VIII., that his majesty made him a baron, viscount, earl of Essex, and at last made him lord high chancellor of England. In the mean time, Signior Frescobald, by repeated losses at sea and land, was reduced to poverty; and calling to mind (without ever thinking of Cromwell), that some English merchants were indebted to him in the sum of 15,000 ducats, he came to London to procure payment. Travelling in pursuit of this affair, he fortunately met with the lord chancellor as he was riding to court; who thinking him to be the same gentleman that had done him such great kindness in Italy, he immediately alighted, embraced him, and with tears of joy asked him, \"If he was not Signior Francis Frescobald, a Florentine merchant?\" \"Yes, Sir (said he) and your most humble servant.\" \"My servant!\" (said the chancellor) No; you are my special friend, that relieved me\nGratitude, in my wants, laid the foundation of my greatness, and, as such, I receive you; and, since the affairs of my sovereign will not now permit a longer conference, I beg you will oblige me this day with your company at my house to dinner with me.\" Signior Frecobald was surprized and affronted with admiration who this great man should be that acknowledged such obligations, and so passionately expressed a kindness for him; but, contemplating a while his voice, his mien, and carriage, he concludes it to be Cromwell, whom he had relieved at Florence; and therefore not a little overjoyed, goes to his house, and attended his coming. His lordship came soon after; and immediately taking his friend by the hand, turns to the lord high admiral and other noblemen in his company, saying, \"Don't your lordships wonder that I am so glad to see this gentleman? This is he who first contributed to my advancement.\" He then told them the whole story; and, holding him still by the hand, led him into the dining-room, and placed him next himself at table. The company being gone, the chancellor made use of this opportunity to know what affair had brought him into England. Frecobald in few words gave him the true state of his circumstances: To which Cromwell replied, \"I am sorry for your misfortunes, and I will make them as easy to you as I can; but, because men ought to be just before they are kind, it is fit I should repay the debt I owe you.\" Then leading him into his closet, he locked the door; and opening a coffer, first took out six ducats, delivering them to Frecobald, and said, \"My friend, here is the money you lent me at Florence, with ten pieces you laid out for my apparel, and ten more you paid for my horse; but, considering you are a merchant, and might have made some advantage by this money in the way of trade, take these four bags, in every one of which is 400 ducats, and enjoy them as the free gift of your friend.\" These the modesty of Frecobald would have refused, but the other forced them upon him. He next cauled him to give him the names of all his debtors, and the sums they owed: which account he transmitted to one of his servants, with a charge to find out the men, and oblige them to pay him in 15 days under the penalty of his displeasure; and the servant to well discharged his duty, that in a short time the entire sum was paid. All this time Signior Frecobald lodged in the chancellor's house, where he was entertained according to his merits, with repeated persuasions for his continuance in England, and an offer of the loan of 60,000 ducats for four years if he would trade there: but he desired to return to Florence, which he did, with extraordinary favours from the lord Cromwell.\n\nThere is a species of grateful remorse, which sometimes has been known to operate forcibly on the minds of the most hardened in impudence. Of this Mr Andrews, who makes the remark, gives an instance in the following anecdote, said to have been a favourite one with the late Dr Campbell. \"Towards the beginning of this century, an actor, celebrated for mimicry, was to have been employed by a comic author, to take off the person, the manner, and the singularly awkward delivery of the celebrated Dr Woodward, who was intended to be introduced on the stage in a laughable character, (viz. in that of Dr Foliole, in Three Hours after Marriage). The mimic dressed himself as a countryman, and waited on the doctor with a long catalogue of ailments, which he said attended on his wife. The physician heard with amazement diseases and pains of the most opposite nature, repeated and redoubled on the wretched patient. For, since the actor's greatest wish was to keep Dr Woodward in his company as long as possible, that he might make the more observations on his gestures, he loaded his poor imaginary spouse with every infirmity which had any probable chance of prolonging the interview. At length, being become completely master of his errand, he drew from his purse a guinea, and, with a scrape, made an uncouth offer of it. 'Put up thy money, poor fellow (cried the doctor); thou hast need of all thy cash and all thy patience too, with such a bundle of diseases tied to thy back.' The actor returned to his employer, and recounted the whole conversation, with such true feeling of the physician's character, that the author trembled with approbation. His raptures were soon checked; for the mimic told him, with the emphasis of sentibleness, that he would sooner die than prostitute his talents to the rendering such genuine humanity a public laughing-stock. The player's name was Griffin.\"\n\nGRATZ, a strong town of Germany, and capital of Styria, with a castle seated on a rock, and an university. The Jesuits had a college here; and there are a great number of handsome palaces, and a fine arsenal. The castle stands on a very lofty hill, and communicates with the river by means of a deep well. The empress-dowager was obliged to retire hither during the war of 1741 and 1742. It is seated on the river Muer, in E. Long. 16. 25. N.

The grave accent is expressed thus ('); and shows, that the voice is to be depressed, and the syllable over which it is place pronounced in a low deep tone.\n\nGRAVE, in Music, is applied to a sound which is in a low or deep tone. The thicker the chord or string, the more grave the tone or note, and the smaller the acuter. Notes are supposed to be the more grave, in proportion as the vibrations of the chord are less quick.\n\nGRAVE, in the Italian music, serves to denote the slowest movement.\n\nGRAVE is also used for a tomb, wherein a person deceased is interred.\n\nGraves, among the Jews, were generally out of the city, though we meet with instances of their interring the dead in towns. Frequent mention is made of graves upon mountains, in highways, in gardens, and private houses. So that nothing on this head seems to have been determined. The same may be observed with respect to the Greeks. The Thebans had a law that every person who built a house should provide a burial-ground. Men who had distinguished themselves were frequently buried in the public forum. The most general custom was, however, to bury out of the city, chiefly by the highway side. The Romans were forbidden by the law of the 12 tables to bury or burn the\nthe dead in the city; but some we find had their sepulchres in Rome, though they paid a fine for the indulgence.\n\nGRAVE, a very strong town of the Netherlands, in Dutch Brabant, seated on the river Maese, beyond which there is a fort. E. Long. 5° 41'. N. Lat. 51° 46'.\n\nGRAVEL, in Natural History and Gardening, a congeries of pebbles, which, mixed with a stiff loam, makes lasting and elegant gravel-walks; an ornament peculiar to our gardens, and which gives them an advantage over those of other nations.\n\nGRAVEL. See Medicine Index.\n\nGRAVEL-WALKS. To make these properly, the bottom should be laid with lime rubbish, large flint-stones, or any other hard matter, for eight or ten inches thick, to keep weeds from growing through, and over this the gravel is to be laid six or eight inches thick. This should be laid rounding up in the middle, by which means the larger stones will run off to the sides, and may be raked away; for the gravel should never be screened before it is laid on. It is a common mistake to lay these walks too round, which not only makes them uneasy to walk upon, but takes off from their apparent breadth. One inch in five feet is a sufficient proportion for the rise in the middle; so that a walk of 25 feet wide should be four inches higher at the middle than at the edges, and so in proportion. As soon as the gravel is laid, it should be raked, and the large stones thrown back again: then the whole should be rolled both lengthwise and crosswise; and the person who draws the roller should wear shoes with flat heels, that he may make no holes; because holes made in a new walk are not easily remedied. The walks should always be rolled three or four times in very hard showers, after which they will bind more firmly than otherwise they could ever be made to do.\n\nGravel with some loam among it, binds more firmly than the rarer kinds; and when gravel is naturally very harsh and sharp, it is proper to add a mixture of loam to it. The best gravel for walks is such as abounds with smooth round pebbles, which, being mixed with a little loam, are bound so firmly together, that they are never afterwards injured either by wet or dry weather. These are not liable to be turned up by the feet in walking, as the more irregularly shaped pebbles, and remain much more firmly in their places after rolling.\n\nGRAVELINES, a strong sea-port town of the Netherlands, in French Flanders, with a castle and harbour, seated in a marshy country on the river Aa, near the sea, in E.

He studied the civil law at Leyden, but mathematical learning was his favourite amusement. When he had taken his doctor's degree in 1707, he settled at the Hague, and practised at the bar, in which situation he cultivated an acquaintance with learned men; with a society of whom, he published a periodical review entitled Le Journal Litteraire, which was continued without interruption from the year 1713 to the year 1722, when he died. The most considerable of his works are, \"A treatise on perspective; An introduction to the Newtonian philosophy, or a treatise on the elements of physics confirmed by experiments; A treatise on the elements of algebra, for the use of young students;\" and \"A course of logic and metaphysics.\" He had intended to have presented the public with a system of morality, but his death prevented the execution. The ministers of the republic consulted him on all occasions wherein his talents were requisite; and his skill in calculation was often of service to them; as was his address in deciphering, for detecting the secret correspondence of their enemies. As professor of mathematics and astronomy at Leyden, none ever applied the powers of nature with more success, or to more useful purposes.\n\nGRAVESEND, a town of Kent in England, situated on the banks of the Thames. It is 25 miles from London; and has a blockhouse well mounted with cannon, to command the ships and river, directly opposite to Tilbury fort in Essex. The town was plundered and burnt by the French and Spaniards in the reign of Richard II., to compensate which, the king, at the request of the abbot of St Mary-le-Grace of Tower-hill, to whom he had granted a manor there called Parrock, vested it and Milton with the sole privilege of carrying passengers by water from hence to London at 4s. the whole fare, or 2d. a-head; which was confirmed by Henry VIII.; but now the fare is 9d. a-head in the tilt-boat, and 1s. in the wherry. The former must not take in above 40 passengers, the latter no more than 8. Coaches ply here at the landing of people from London, &c. to carry them to Rochester, at 1s. 6d. each. This town and Milton were incorporated by Queen Elizabeth by the name of the portreeve (now the mayor), jurats, and inhabitants of Gravesend and Milton: And as Gravesend is the place where most passengers through Kent from foreign parts take boat for London, that queen, in order to show the grandeur of the metropolis of her kingdom, ordered the lord mayor, aldermen, and city companies, to receive all ambassadors and eminent strangers here in their formalities, and to attend them to London in barges if by water; or if they chose to come by land, they were to meet them on horseback on Blackheath in their livery gowns. The towns for several miles round are supplied from hence with garden stuffs; of which great quantities are also sent to London, where theparagus of Gravesend is preferred to that of Battersea. All outward-bound ships are obliged to anchor in this road till they have been visited by the customhouse officers; and for this purpose a sentinel at the blockhouse fires a musket; but the homeward-bound all pass by without notice, unless it be to put waters on board, if they are not supplied before. As the outward-bound generally take in provisions here, the place is full of seamen, who are all in a hurry. The whole town being burnt down in 1727, 5000.\nGRAVINA was granted by the parliament in 1731 for rebuilding its church, as one of the 50 new ones. In 1624, one Mr Pinnock gave 21 dwelling-houses here, besides one for a matter weaver, to employ the poor; and here is a charity-school for 24 boys, who are both taught and clothed. The town-house was erected in 1764; and in 1772 an act of parliament empowered the inhabitants to pave and light their streets.\n\nGRAVINA, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and Terra di Bari, with a bishop's see, and the title of a duchy. E. Long, 17. N. Lat. 41.\n\nGRAVITATION, in Natural Philosophy, is sometimes distinguished from gravity. Thus M. Maupertuis takes gravity for that force whereby a body would fall to the earth; but gravitation for the same diminished by the centrifugal force. See NEWTONIAN Philosophy.\n\nGRAVITY, or Gravitation (for the words are most commonly used synonymously), signifies either the force by which bodies are pressed towards the surface of the earth, or the manifest effect of that force; in which last sense the word has the same signification with weight or heaviness.\n\nConcerning gravity in the first sense of the word, or that active power by which all bodies are impelled towards the earth, there have been great disputes. Many eminent philosophers, and among the rest Sir Isaac Newton himself, have considered it as the first of all second causes; an incorporeal or spiritual substance, which never can be perceived any other way than by its effects; an universal property of matter, &c. Others have attempted to explain the phenomena of gravitation by the action of a very subtle ethereal fluid; and to this explanation Sir Isaac, in the latter part of his life, seems not to have been adverse. He hath even given a conjecture concerning the manner in which this fluid might occasion these phenomena. But for a full account of the discoveries of this great philosopher concerning the laws of gravitation, the conjectures made by him and others concerning its cause, the various objections that have been made to his doctrine, and the state of the dispute at present, see the articles NEWTONIAN Philosophy and ASTRONOMY.\n\nSpecific Gravity denotes the weight belonging to an equal bulk of every different substance. Thus the exact weight of a cubic inch of gold, compared with a cubic inch of water, tin, lead, &c., is called its specific gravity.

See GREY.\n\nGRAY, Thomas, an admired English poet, was the youngest and only surviving son of a reputable citizen of London, and was born in Cornhill in 1716. He was educated at Eton, where he contracted a friendship with Mr Horace Walpole, and with Mr Richard West son of the lord chancellor of Ireland. Mr West and Mr Gray were both intended for the bar; but the former died early in life, and the latter was diverted from that pursuit by an invitation to accompany Mr Walpole in his travels; which he accepted without any determined plan for his future life. During Mr Gray's travels, he wrote a variety of letters to Mr West and to his parents, which are printed with his poems; and when he returned, finding himself in narrow circumstances, yet with a mind disposed for active employment, he retired to Cambridge, and devoted himself to study. Soon after his return, his friend West died; and the melancholy impressed on him by this event may be traced in his admired \"Elegy written in a country churchyard,\" which is thought to have been begun, if not finished, at this time; though the conclusion, as it stands at present, is certainly different from what it was in the first manuscript copy. The first impulse of his sorrow for the death of his friend gave birth to a very tender sonnet in English, on the Petrarchian model; and also to a sublime apostrophe in hexameters, written in the genuine strain of classical majesty, with which he intended to begin one of his books De Principiis cognitandi.\n\nFrom the winter of the year 1742, to the day of his death, his principal residence was at Cambridge: from which he was seldom absent any considerable time, except between the years 1759 and 1762; when on the opening of the British Museum, he took lodgings in Southampton-row, in order to have recourse to the Harleian and other manuscripts there deposited, from which he made several curious extracts, amounting in all to a tolerable sized folio, at present in the hands of Mr Walpole.\n\nAbout the year 1747, Mr Mason, the editor of Mr Gray's poems, was introduced to him. The former had written, a year or two before, some imitations of Milton's juvenile poems, viz. A Monody on the death of Mr Pope, and two pieces entitled Il Bellissimo and Il Pacifico on the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle; and the latter revised them at the request of a friend. This laid the foundation of an intimacy which continued without interruption to the death of Mr Gray.\n\nAbout the year 1759, Mr Gray had put his last hand to his celebrated Elegy written in a country church-yard, and had communicated it to his friend Mr Walpole, whose good taste was too much charmed with it to suffer him to withhold the sight of it from his acquaintance. Accordingly it was shown about for some time in manuscript, and received with all the applause it so justly merited. At last the publisher of one of the magazines having obtained a surreptitious copy of it, Mr Gray wrote to Mr Walpole, desiring that he would put his own manuscript into the hands of Mr Doddley, and order him to print it immediately. This was the most popular of all our author's publications. It ran through eleven editions in a very short space of time; was finely translated into Latin by Messrs Anstey and Roberts; and in the same year by Mr Lloyd.\n\nFrom July 1759 to the year 1762, he generally re-\nfided in London, with a view, as we have already ob-\nserved, of having recourse to the British Museum. In\nJuly 1768, his grace the duke of Grafton wrote him\na polite letter, informing him, that his majesty had\nbeen pleased to offer to him the professorship of Mo-\ndern History in the university of Cambridge, then va-\ncant by the death of Mr Laurence Brocket. This\nplace was valuable in itself, the salary being £400l. a-\nyear; but what rendered it particularly acceptable to\nMr Gray was its being given him without any solic-\nitation. He was indeed remarkably disinterested in all\nhis pursuits. Though his income, before this addi-\ntion, was very small, he never read or wrote with a\nview of making his labours useful to himself. He may\nbe said to have been of those few personages in the\nannals of literature, especially in the poetical class,\nwho are devoid of self-interest, and at the same time\nattentive to economy; and also was among mankind\nin general one of those very few economists, who pos-\nsess that talent, untinctured with the slightest stain of\navarice. When his circumstances were at the lowest,\nhe gave away such sums in private charity, as would\nhave done credit to an ampler purse. But what chief-\nly deterred him from seeking any advantage by his\nliterary pursuits, was a certain degree of pride, which\nled him to despise the idea of being thought an author\nby profession.\n\nHowever, it is probable, that early in life he had\nan intention of publishing an edition of Strabo; for\nhis papers contain a great number of notes and geo-\ngraphical disquisitions on that author, particularly\nwith respect to that part of Asia which comprehends\nPersia and India. The indefatigable pains which he\ntook with the writings of Plato, and the quantity of\ncritical as well as explanatory observations which he\nhas left upon almost every part of his works, plainly\nindicate, that no man in Europe was better prepared\nto publish and illustrate that philosopher than Mr\nGray. Another work, on which he bestowed uncom-\nmon labour, was the Anthologia. In an interleaved\ncopy of that collection of Greek epigrams, he has tran-\nscribed several additional ones, which he selected in his\nextensive reading; has inserted a great number of cri-\ntical notes and emendations, and subjoined a copious\nindex. But whether he intended this performance for\nthe press or not, is uncertain. The only work which\nhe meditated upon with this direct view from the be-\nginning was a history of English poetry, upon a plan\nsketched out by Mr Pope. He has mentioned this\nhimself in an advertisement to those three fine imita-\ntions of Norse and Welch poetry, which he gave the\nworld in the last edition of his poems. But after he\nhad made some considerable preparations for the exe-\ncution of this design, and Mr Mason had offered him\nhis assistance, he was informed, that Mr Warton, of\nTrinity College, Oxford, was engaged in a work of\nthe same kind. The undertaking was therefore relin-\nquished, by mutual consent; and soon after, on that\ngentleman's desiring a sight of the plan, our author\nreadily sent him a copy of it.\n\nAmong other sciences, Mr Gray had acquired a\ngreat knowledge of Gothic architecture. He had seen\nand accurately studied in his youth, while abroad, the\nRoman proportions on the spot, both in ancient times,\nand in the works of Palladio. In his later years he\napplied himself to consider those stupendous structures\nof more modern date that adorn our own country;\nwhich, if they have not the same grace, have undoubt-\nedly equal dignity. He endeavoured to trace this\nmode of building from the time it commenced through\nits various changes, till it arrived at its perfection in\nthe reign of Henry VIII. and ended in that of Eliza-\nbeth. For this purpose, he did not too much depend\nupon written accounts, as that internal evidence which\nthe buildings themselves give of their respective antiq-\nuity; since they constantly furnish to the well-informed\neye, arms, ornaments, and other marks, by which\ntheir several ages may be ascertained. On this account\nhe applied himself to the study of heraldry as a prepa-\nratory science; and has left behind him a number of\ngenealogical papers, more than sufficient to prove him\na complete master of it. By these means he arrived at\nso very extraordinary a pitch of sagacity, as to be en-\nabled to pronounce, at first sight, on the precise time\nwhen every particular part of any of our cathedrals was\nerected. But the favourite study of Mr Gray for the\nlast ten years of his life was natural history, which he\nthen rather resumed than began; as by the instruc-\ntions of his uncle Antrobus, he was a considerable bo-\ntanist at 15. The marginal notes which he has left on\nLinnaeus and other writers on the vegetable, animal,\nand fossil kingdoms, are very numerous; but the most\nconsiderable are on Hudson's Flora Anglica, and the\ntenth edition of the Systema Naturae; which latter he\ninterleaved and filled almost entirely. While employ-\ned on zoology, he read Aristotle's treatise on that sub-\nject with great care, and explained many difficult pas-\nsages of that obscure ancient by the lights he had re-\nceived from modern naturalists. In a word, excepting\npure mathematics, and the studies dependent on that\nscience, there was hardly any part of human learning\nin which he had not acquired a competent skill, and\nin most of them a consummate mastery. To this ac-\ncount of his literary character we may add, that he\nhad a fine taste in painting, prints, gardening, and\nmusic; and was moreover a man of good breeding,\nvirtue, and humanity.\n\nHe died in 1771: and an edition of his poems, with\nmemoirs of his life and writings, were published in 4to,\nin 1773, by Mr Mason. This gentleman, however,\ninstead of employing his own pen in drawing Mr Gray's\ncharacter, has adopted one drawn by the reverend Mr\nTemple, rector of Mamhead in Devonshire, in a letter to\nMr Bolwell; to whom the public are indebted for com-\nmunicating it. \"Perhaps (says Mr Temple) he was the\nmost learned man in Europe. He was equally acquainted\nwith the elegant and profound parts of science, and\nthat not superficially but thoroughly. He knew every\nbranch of history, both natural and civil; had read all\nthe original historians of England, France, and Italy:\nand was a great antiquarian. Criticism, metaphysics,\nmorals, politics, made a principal part of his plan of\nstudy; voyages and travels of all sorts were his favour-\nite amusement; and he had a fine taste in painting,\nprints, architecture, and gardening. With such a\nfund of knowledge, his conversation must have been\nequally instructing and entertaining; but he was also\na good man, a well-bred man, a man of virtue and hu-\nmanity. There is no character without some speck,\nsome imperfection; and I think the greatest defect in\nhis\nGrayling his was an affectation in delicacy, or rather effeminacy, and a visible fastidiousness, or contempt and disdain of his inferiors in science. He also had, in some degree, that weakness which disgusted Voltaire so much in Mr Congreve: though he seemed to value others chiefly according to the progress they had made in knowledge, yet he could not bear to be considered himself merely as a man of letters; and though without birth, or fortune, or station, his desire was to be looked upon as a private independent gentleman, who read for his amusement. Perhaps it may be said, What signifies so much knowledge, when it produces so little? Is it worth taking so much pains to leave no memorial but a few poems? But let it be considered, that Mr Gray was, to others, at least innocently employed; to himself, certainly beneficially. His time passed agreeably; he was every day making some new acquisition in science; his mind was enlarged, his heart softened, and his virtue strengthened; the world and mankind were shown to him without a mask; and he was taught to consider every thing as trifling, and unworthy the attention of a wise man, except the pursuit of knowledge, and the practice of virtue in that state wherein God hath placed us.\"\n\nGRAYLING.

See TONE.\n\nGREAVES, JOHN, an eminent physician and antiquary, was the eldest son of John Greaves rector of Colemore, near Alresford in Hampshire, and born in 1602. He was educated at Balliol College in Oxford, from which he removed to Merton. He was afterwards, on the foot of his great merit, chosen geometry professor of Gresham college. His ardent thirst of knowledge soon carried him into several parts of Europe, where he eagerly seized every opportunity of improving it. His next voyage was into the eastern countries; where nothing remarkable in the heavens, earth, or even subterraneous places, seems to have escaped his nice observation. He, with indefatigable industry, and even at the peril of his life, collected a considerable number of Arabic, Peric, and Greek manuscripts, for Archbishop Laud. Of these he well knew the value, as he was a master of the languages in which they were written. He also collected for that prelate many oriental gems and coins. He took a more accurate survey of the pyramids than any traveller who went before him. On his return from the East, he visited several parts of Italy a second time. During his stay at Rome, he made a particular inquiry into the true state of the ancient weights and measures. Soon after he had finished his second voyage, he was chosen Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford. He was eminently qualified for this professorship, as the works of ancient and modern astronomers were familiar to him. His books relating to oriental learning, his Pyramidographia, or a description of the pyramids in Egypt, his Epochae Celebriorum, and other curious and useful pieces, of which Mr Ward has given us a catalogue, show him to have been a great man. Those which he intended to publish would have shown him to be a greater; but he was stopped in his great career by death in 1652.\n\nGREBE. See COLUMBUS, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nGREECE, the present Romelia, and in many respects one of the most deservedly celebrated countries in the world, was anciently bounded on the north by Macedonia and the river Strymon; on the west by the Ionian sea; on the north by the Mediterranean; on the east by the Egean sea and Archipelago. It extended from the Strymon, by which it was parted from Thrace, to the promontory of Tenaurus, the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus, now the Morea, about 6° 20' of latitude, or nearly 440 English miles, and in breadth from east to west about 359 miles.\n\nThe general names by which the inhabitants of this country were known to the ancients were those of Graioi, or Graicoi, from whence the name of Greece is plainly derived. These names are thought to come from Grecus, the father, or (according to some) the son, of Thestius, who gave name to Thestia; but some modern critics choose to derive it from Ragau, the same with Reu, the son of Peleg, by the transposition of a letter to soften the sound.—These names were afterwards changed for Achai and Hellenes; the first, as is supposed from Achaeus, the son of Xuthus, the son of Hellen, and father of Ion; or, according to the fable, the son of Jupiter: the other from Hellen, above-mentioned, the son of Deucalion, and father of Dorus, from whom came the Dorae, afterwards a famous nation among the Greeks. Another name by which the Greeks were known in some parts of the country, was that of Pelaegia, which the Arcadians, the most ancient people in Greece, deduced from their pretended founder Pelaegius, who is said to have got such footing in Peloponnesus, that the whole peninsula from him was called Pelaegia. But the most ancient name of all is universally allowed to have been that of Iones, which the Greeks themselves derived from Ion the son of Xuthus;\nXuthus; or, as the fable hath it, of Apollo, by Creusa the daughter of Erechtheus the grandson of Deucalion. Jofephus, however, affirms, that their original is of much older date; and that Javan, the son of Japhet, and grandson of Noah, was the first who peopled these countries; which Bochart hath also rendered very probable. It is true, indeed, that among the Greeks themselves, only the Athenians, and such colonies as sprung from them, were called Ionics; but it is also plain beyond exception, that other nations gave this name to all the inhabitants of Greece.\n\nThe inhabitants of Greece in the first ages, even by the confession of their own historians, appear to have been savages scarce a degree removed from brutes. They lived indifferently on every fruit, herb, or root that came in their way; and lay either in the open fields, or at best sheltered themselves in dens, caves, and hollow trees: the country itself in the meantime remaining one continued uncultivated desert. The first improvement they made in their way of living, was the exchanging of their old food for the more wholesome acorns, building huts for themselves to sleep in, and covering their bodies with the skins of beasts. For all this, it seems, they were beholden to Pelagius above-mentioned (supposed by some to be Peleg spoken of in Scripture), and who was highly reverenced by them on that account.—This reformation in their way of life, however, it seems wrought none in their manners. On the contrary, they who had nothing to fight for but a hole to sleep in, began now to envy and rob one another of these slender acquisitions. This, in process of time, put them under a necessity of joining themselves into companies under some head, that they might either more safely plunder their neighbours, or preserve what they had got. Laws they had none, except that of the sword: so that those only lived in safety who inhabited the most barren and craggy places; and hence Greece for a long time had no settled inhabitants, the weakest always turned out by the strongest. Their gigantic size and strength, if we may believe Plutarch, added so much to their insolence and cruelty, that they seemed to glory in committing the greatest acts of violence and barbarity on those that unhappily fell into their hands.\n\nThe next advance towards civilization, was their forming themselves into regular societies, to cultivate the lands, and build themselves towns and cities for their safety. Their original barbarity and mutual violences against each other naturally prevented them from uniting as one nation, or even into any considerable community; and hence the great number of states into which Greece was originally divided. The most remarkable of these small principalities mentioned in history are the following: In Peloponnesus were those of Sicyon, Argos, and Messenia, Achaia Propria, Arcadia, and Laconia. In Graecia Propria (that part of Greece which lay without Peloponnesus), were those of Attica, Megara, Bœotia, Lucris, Epichnemidia, Doris, Phocis, Locris, Ozelea, and Ætolia. In Epirus were the Molossi, Amphilochi, Calydonii, Dracopes, Chaecos, Thesprotii, Almeni, and Acarnani. In Thessaly were those of Thessalotis, Eritotis, Pelaigotis, Magnesia and Phthia.—All these have at one time or other been severally governed by kings of their own, though we only find the names of many of them mentioned in the histories of the more considerable kingdoms of Sparta, Attica, Thebes, &c.—The erection of these kingdoms, however, for some time, did not much alter the case; the inhabitants of the new kingdoms plundered and destroyed one another without mercy. Attica was the only place in any degree free from these incursions, because it was naturally destitute of every thing that could invite a plundering enemy; but those cities fared much worse which were situated on the sea-coasts; because they were in continual danger of being plundered either by sea or land: for pirates at that time did not less infest all those seas than robbers did the land. And this was one main cause why most of the ancient cities of Greece were situated at some considerable distance from the shore; but even in these, as all their safety consisted in the resistance they could make against an invader, their inhabitants were under the necessity of going constantly armed, and being ever on their guard.\n\nAnother mischief arising from these continual piracies and robberies was, that they occasioned the far greater part of the lands to lie uncultivated, so that the people only planted and sowed as much as was barely necessary for their present support; and where there was such an universal neglect of agriculture, there could be as little room for any discoveries in other useful arts and trades. Hence, when other nations, as the Jews, Egyptians, Midianites, Phœnicians, &c. had improved themselves to a very high degree, the Greeks seem to have been utter strangers to every useful art.\n\nDuring this period of savage barbarity, the most renowned Grecian heroes, as Hercules, Theseus, &c. performed their exploits; which, however exaggerated by poetical fiction, no doubt had a foundation in truth. Some indeed are of opinion that the Grecian heroes are entirely fictitious, and their exploits derived from those of the Hebrew worthies, such as Samson, Gideon, &c. Yet, considering the extreme degree of barbarity which at that time prevailed throughout Greece, it seems not at all improbable that some persons of extraordinary strength and courage might undertake the cause of the oppressed, and travel about like the more modern knights-errant in quest of adventures.\n\nThe first expedition in which we find the Greeks united, was that against Troy, the particulars of which are recited under the article Troy. Their success here (which happened about 1184 B.C.) cost them very dear; vast numbers of their bravest warriors being slain; great numbers of the survivors being cast away in their return; and many of those who had the good luck to get back again, being soon after murdered, or driven out of their country. It is probable, however, that their having flaid for such a long time in Asia, might contribute to civilize the Greeks somewhat sooner than what they otherwise would have been; and accordingly from this time, we find their history somewhat less obscure, and as it were beginning to emerge out of darkness. The continual wars, indeed, in which they were engaged among themselves, no doubt, for a long time, prevented them from making any considerable advances in those arts in which they afterwards made so great progress. These wars, which\nwhich indeed never ceased as long as the Greeks preserved their liberty, rendered them brave, and skilled in the military art above all other nations; but at the same time they effectually prevented them from making permanent conquests, and confined them within the bounds of their own country; while the different states were one way or other so equally balanced, that scarce one of them was able perfectly to subdue another. The Spartans, however, having with great difficulty, reduced the kingdom of Messene, and added its territories to their own, became the leading people in Greece. Their superiority was long disputed by Athens; but the Peloponnesian war at last determined that point in favour of the Spartans, when the city of Athens was taken, and its walls demolished by Ly- sander the Spartan general. See Attica, No. 164.\n\n—By the battle of Leuctra, the Spartans lost that superiority which they had maintained for 500 years, and which now devolved on the Thebans. After the death of Epaminondas, the celebrated Theban general, however, as no person was found possessed of his abilities, the Thebans were again obliged to yield the superiority to the Spartans. But by this time the Greeks had become acquainted with the luxuries and elegancies of life; and all the rigour of their original laws could not prevent them from valuing these as highly as other people. This did not indeed abate their valour, but it heightened their mutual animosities; at the same time that, for the sake of a more easy and comfortable life, they became more disposed to submit to a master. The Persians, whose power they had long dreaded, and who were unable to resist them by force of arms, at last found out (by the advice of Alcibiades) the proper method of reducing the Grecian power; namely, by afflicting them by turns, and supplying one state with money to fight against another till they should be all so much reduced, that they might become an easy prey. Thus the Greeks were weakened, though the Persians did not reap any benefit from their weakness. Philip of Macedon entered into the same political views; and partly by intrigue, partly by force, got himself declared generalissimo of Greece. His successor Alexander the Great completed their subjection; and by destroying the city of Thebes, and exterminating its inhabitants, struck such a terror throughout Greece, that he was as fully obeyed by all the states as by any of the rest of his subjects. During his absence in Persia, however, they attempted to shake off the Macedonian yoke, but were quelled by his general Antipater. The news of Alexander's death was to them a matter of the utmost joy; but their mutual animosities prevented them from joining in any solid plan for the recovery of their liberties, and hence they continued to be oppressed by Alexander's successors, or other tyrants, till Aratus, an Achaean, about 268 B.C. formed a design of setting his country free from these oppressors. He persuaded a number of the small republics to enter into a league for their own defence, which was called the Achaean league; and notwithstanding that the republics, taken singly, had very little strength, they not only maintained their independency, but soon became formidable when united. This association continued to become daily more and more powerful; but received a severe check from Cleomenes, king of Sparta, which obliged them to call in Antigonus to their assistance. This prince overcame Cleomenes, at the battle of Sellasia, and afterwards made himself master of Sparta. Thus he became a more formidable enemy than the one he had conquered, and the recovery of the Grecian liberties was incomplete.\n\nSoon after this, the Greeks began to feel the weight of a power more formidable than any which they had yet experienced; namely, that of the Romans. That insidious and haughty republic first intermeddled with the Grecian affairs, under pretence of setting them at liberty from the oppression of Philip of Macedon. This, by a proper union among themselves, they might have accomplished; but in this they acted as though they had been infatuated; receiving with the utmost joy the decree of the Roman consul, who declared them free; without considering, that he who had thus given them liberty, might take it away at his pleasure. This lesson, however, they were soon taught, by the total reduction of their country to a Roman province; yet this can scarce be called a misfortune, when we look back to their history, and consider their outrages upon one another: nor can we sympathize with them for the loss of that liberty which they only made use of to fill their country with slaughter and bloodshed. After their conquest by the Romans, they made no united effort to recover their liberty. They continued in quiet subjection till the beginning of the 15th century. About that time, they began to suffer under the tyranny of the Turks, and their sufferings were completed by the taking of Constantinople in 1453. Since that time they have groaned under the yoke of a most despotic government; so that all traces of their former valour, ingenuity, and learning, are now in a manner totally extinct.\n\nModern Greece comprehends Macedon; Albania, now called Arnaut; Epirus; Thessaly, now Jana; Achaia, now Livadia; the Peloponnesus, now Morea; together with the islands on its coast, and in the Archipelago. The continent of Greece is seated betwixt the 36th and 43rd degrees of north latitude; and between the 19th and 27th degrees of longitude, east of London. To the north, it is bounded by Bulgaria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains; to the south by the Mediterranean sea; to the east by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the west by the Adriatic or gulf of Venice. Its length is said to be about 400 miles, and its utmost breadth about 350 miles. The air is extremely temperate and healthy: and the soil fruitful, though badly cultivated; yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and venison. As to religion, Christianity was planted in Greece soon after the death of our Saviour, and flourished there for many ages in great purity; but since the Greeks became subject to the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into the most deplorable ignorance, in consequence of the slavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their religion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and absurdities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Constantinople; who is chosen by the neighbouring archbishops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a person of great dignity, being the head and director of the eastern church.\nThe other patriarchs are those of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. Mr Tournefort tells us, that the patriarchates are now generally set at nought, and bestowed upon those who are the highest bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, are always chosen from among the Caloyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a vest of linen-wool, or some other stuff, presented by the grand signior to ambassadors, and other persons newly invested with some considerable dignity, they are obliged to make large presents to the vizier, &c. The income of the patriarch of Constantinople is said to amount to no less than one hundred and twenty thousand guilders, of which he pays the one-half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman Porte, adding five thousand guilders besides as a present at the feast of Bairam. The next person to a bishop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then come the abbot, the arch-priest, the priest, the deacon, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lector. The secular clergy are subjected to no rules, and never rise higher than high-priest. They are allowed to marry once; but it must be with a virgin, and before they are ordained. They have neither glebe nor tithes, but depend upon the perquisites that arise from their office; and they seldom preach but in Lent. The Greeks have few numeraries; but a great many convents of monks, who are all priests, and, students excepted, obliged to follow some handicraft employment, and lead a very austere life. The Greeks deny the supremacy of the pope, and abhor the worship of images; but have a multitude of pictures of saints in their churches, whom they pray to as mediators. Their fasts are very severe. They believe also in the doctrine of transubstantiation, and that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son. They admit not of purgatory, says Mr Thevenot; but yet they allow a third place, where they say the blessed remain, in expectation of the day of judgment. At mats they consecrate with leavened bread; and communicate under both kinds, as well laics as priests, and as well women and children as men. When they carry the sacrament to the sick, they do not prostrate themselves before it, nor expose it to be adored; neither do they carry it in procession, or have any particular feast in honour of it. Baptism is performed among them by plunging the whole body of the child thrice into water. Immediately after baptism, they give it confirmation and the communion; and seven days after that, it undergoes the ceremony of ablution. When a priest is married, among other ceremonies, the bridegroom and bride drink each two glasses of wine; then the glass is given to the priest, who merrily drinks off the rest of the wine, and breaking the glass, says, So may the bridegroom break the virginity of the bride. As to the character of the modern Greeks, they are said to be very covetous, hypocritical, treacherous, great pederasts, and at the same time revengeful to the highest degree; but very superstitious. They are so much despised by the Turks, that they do not value even a Greek who turns Mahometan. The Turks are remarkable for their taciturnity; they never use any unnecessary words; but the Greeks, on the contrary, are very talkative and lively. The Turks generally practise what their religion enjoins, but the Greeks do not; and their misery puts them upon thousand mean shifts and scandalous practices, authorized by bad example, and perpetuated from father to son. The Greek women have fine features and beautiful complexions: their countenances still very much resemble those of the ancient Greek statues.\n\nGreek, or Grecian, anything belonging to ancient Greece.\n\nThe Greek language, as preserved in the writings of the celebrated authors of antiquity, as Homer, Hesiod, Demosthenes, Aristotle, Plato, Xenophon, &c., has a great variety of terms and expressions, suitable to the genius and occasions of a polite and learned people, who had a taste for arts and sciences. In it, proper names are significative; which is the reason that the modern languages borrow so many terms from it. When any new invention, instrument, machine, or the like, is discovered, recourse is generally had to the Greek for a name to it; the facility wherewith words are there compounded, affording such as will be expressive of its use: such are, barometer, hygrometer, microscope, telescope, thermometer, &c. But of all sciences, medicine most abounds with such terms; as diaphoretic, diagnosis, diarrhoea, hemorrhagy, hydrophobia, phthisis, atrophy, &c. Besides the copiousness and significance of the Greek, wherein it excels most, if not all, other languages, it has also three numbers, viz. a singular, dual, and plural: also abundance of tenses in its verbs, which makes a variety in discourse, prevents a certain dryness that always accompanies too great an uniformity, and renders that language peculiarly proper for all kinds of verse. The use of the participles, of the aorist and preterite, together with the compound words already mentioned, give it a peculiar force and brevity, without taking anything from its perspicuity.\n\nIt is no easy matter to assign the precise difference between the modern and ancient Greek; which consists in the terminations of the nouns, pronouns, verbs, &c., not unlike what obtains between some of the dialects of the Italian or Spanish. There are also in the modern Greek many new words, not to be met with in the ancient. We may therefore distinguish three ages of the Greek tongue: the first of which ends at the time when Constantinople became the capital of the Roman empire; the second lasted from that period to the taking of Constantinople by the Turks; and the third from that time to this.\n\nGreek Bible. See Bible.\n\nGreek Church, is that part of the Christian church which is established in Greece; extending likewise to some other parts of Turkey. See Greece.—It is thus called in Europe, Asia, and Africa, in contradistinction from the Latin or Romish church; as also the Eastern church, in distinction from the Western.\n\nThe Romanists call the Greek church the Greek schism; because the Greeks do not allow the authority of the pope, but depend wholly, as to matters of religion, on their own patriarchs. They have treated them as schismatics ever since the revolt, as they call it, of the patriarch Photius.\n\nGreek Monks and Nuns, of whatever order, consider St Basil as their founder and common father, and esteem\nGreek Orders, in Architecture, are the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian; in contradistinction to the two Latin orders, the Tuscan and Composite. See ORDER.\n\nGREEN, one of the original prismatic colours, exhibited by the refraction of the rays of light. See CHROMATICS and COLOUR.\n\nGREEN, among painters and dyers. See COLOUR-Making, No. 27, and DYEING, No. 367.\n\nGREEN-Cloth, a board or court of justice held in the compting-house of the king's household, composed of the lord steward and officers under him, who sit daily. To this court is committed the charge and oversight of the king's household in matters of justice and government, with a power to correct all offenders, and to maintain the peace of the verge, or jurisdiction of the court-royal; which is every way about 200 yards from the last gate of the palace where his majesty resides.\n\nIt takes its name, board of green cloth; from a green cloth spread over the board where they sit.\n\nWithout a warrant first obtained from this court, none of the king's servants can be arrested for debt.\n\nClerks of the Green Cloth were two officers of the board of green cloth, who appointed the diet of the king and his household; and kept all records, ledgers, and papers relating thereto; made up bills, parcels, and debentures for salaries, and provisions and necessaries for the officers of the buttery, pantry, cellar, &c. They also waited upon foreign princes when entertained by his majesty. But this has been lately abolished.\n\nGREEN-Finch, the English name of the greenish fringilla, with the wings and tail variegated with yellow. See FRINGILLA, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nGREEN-House, or Conservatory, a house in a garden, contrived for sheltering and preserving the most curious and tender exotic plants, which in our climate will not bear to be exposed to the open air, especially during the winter season. These are generally large and beautiful structures, equally ornamental and useful.\n\nThe length of green-houses must be proportioned to the number of plants intended to be preserved in them, and cannot therefore be reduced to rule; but their depth should never be greater than their height in the clear; which, in small or middling houses, may be 16 or 18 feet, but in large ones from 20 to 24 feet; and the length of the windows should reach from about one foot and a half above the pavement, and within the same distance of the ceiling, which will admit of a corniche round the building over the heads of the windows. Their breadth cannot be in proportion to their length; for if in the largest buildings they are more than seven or seven feet and a half broad, they will be extremely heavy and inconvenient. The piers between the windows must be as narrow as may be to support the building; for which reason they should either be of stone or of hard burnt bricks. If the piers are made of stone, they should be 30 inches wide in front, and flopped off behind to about 18 inches, by which means there will be no corners to take off the rays of the sun. If they are of brick, they will require to be at least three feet in front, but they should be in the same manner flopped off behind. Over the green-house may be rooms for drying and preserving seeds, roots, &c., and behind it a place for tools and other purposes; and both these behind, and the rooms above, will be of great use in keeping off the frosts, so that the wall between these need not be of more than two bricks and a half in thickness.\n\nThe floor of the green-house, which should be laid either with Bremen squares, Purbeck stone, or flat tiles, must be raised two feet above the surface of the adjoining ground, or if the situation be damp, at least three feet; and if the whole is arched with low brick arches under the floor, they will be of great service in preventing damps; and under the floor, about two feet from the front, it will be very advisable to make a flue of ten inches wide and two feet deep: this should be carried the whole length of the house, and then returned back along the hinder part, and there be carried up into funnels adjoining to the tool-house, by which the smoke may be carried off. The fire-place may be contrived at one end of the house, and the door at which the fuel is put in, as also the ash-grate, may be contrived to open into the tool-house, and the fuel being laid in the same place, the whole will be out of sight. Bradley advises, that the front of greenhouses, in the colder parts of England, be built in a sweep or semicircle, so that one part or other of it may receive the sun's rays all day. The use of fires must, however, be very sparing in this place; and it is not one winter in three or four that will require them in any part, only when the weather is very severe, and the frost cannot well be kept out any other way, this is an expedient that is good to have in readiness, as it may save a whole house of plants. Withinside of the windows, in front of the green-house, there should be good strong shutters, made with hinges, to fold back close to the piers, that they may not obstruct the rays of the sun. The back part of the house should be either laid over with flueco or plastered with mortar, and whitewashed, in order to prevent the frothy air from penetrating through the walls. When the green-house is wainscoted, the walls should be plastered with lime and hair behind the wainscot, to keep out the cold; and the wainscot, as well as the ceiling, and every part within the house, should be painted white, for the reflection of the sun's rays. There must be a number of trellises with forms of wood upon them, to support the pots of plants; the tallest to be placed hindmost, the lowest within four feet of the windows; and the rows of plants should rise gradually, so that the heads of the second row should be entirely above the first; and behind them there should be a space of at least five feet, for the convenience of watering the plants, and for a free circulation of air. It has been observed, that the placing of the euphorium, cereus, and other succulent plants among orange-trees, and other common green-house plants, is always destructive of them, by making them receive an improper sort of effluvia, which plants of that kind imbibe very freely. They should therefore be placed in two wings built...\nbuilt at each end of the green-house; which, if well contrived, will be a great beauty as well as use to the building. These wings may be made capable of a great warmth also by more flues, and may be made to contain a hot-bed of tanner's bark for the raising many of the tender plants, natives of warm climates.\n\nWhilst the front of the green-house is exactly south, one of the wings may be made to face the south-east and the other the south-west. By this disposition the heat of the sun is reflected from one part of the building to the other all day, and the front of the main green-house is guarded from the cold winds. These two wings may be so contrived as to maintain plants of different degrees of hardiness, which may be easily affected by the situation and extent of the fire-place, and the manner of conducting the flues: the wing facing the south-east is evidently the most proper for the warmest flows; this may be divided in the middle by a partition of glass, with glass-doors opening from one division to the other. In each of these there should be a fire-place, with flues carried up against the back-wall, through which the smoke should be made to pass as many times the length of the house as the height will admit of the number of flues; for the longer the smoke is in passing, the more heat will be given to the house with a less quantity of fuel. The other wing, facing the south-west, should be divided and furnished with flues in the same manner; and thus different degrees of heat may be obtained, according to the seasons and the particular sorts of plants that are to be preserved. If there are no sheds behind these wings, the walls should not be less than three bricks thick; and the back part, having sloping roofs, which are covered with tiles or slates, should be lined with reeds, &c., under the covering. The sloping glases of these houses should be made to slide and take off, so that they may be drawn down more or less in warm weather to admit air to the plants; and the upright glases in front may be so contrived as that every other may open as doors upon hinges, and the alternate glases may be divided into two, the upper part of each should be so contrived as to be drawn down like shades, so that either of them may be used to admit air in a greater or less quantity as there may be occasion.\n\nAs to the management of the plants in the green-house, Mortimer recommends the opening of the mould about them from time to time, and sprinkling a little fresh mould in them, and a little warm dung on that; as also to water them when the leaves begin to wither and curl, and not oftener, which would make them fade and be sickly; and to take off such leaves as wither and grow dry.\n\n**GREEN-Sickness.** See Chlorosis, Medicine Index.\n\n**GREEN-Silver,** the name of an ancient custom within the manor of Writtle in the county of Essex in England; which is, that every tenant whose fore-door opens to Greenbury, shall pay an halfpenny yearly to the lord, by the name of green-fisher.\n\n**GREEN-Wax,** is used where estates are delivered to the sheriffs out of the exchequer, under the seal of that court, made in green wax, to be levied in the several counties. This word is mentioned the 43rd stat. Ed. III. c. 9, and 7 Hen. IV. c. 4.\n\n**GREENLAND,** a general name by which are denoted the most easterly parts of America, stretching towards the north pole, and likewise some islands to the Greenland-northward of the continent of Europe, lying in very high latitudes.\n\nThis country is divided into West and East Greenland.—West Greenland is now determined by our latest describe maps to be a part of the continent of America, though upon what authority is not very clear. That part of it which the Europeans have any knowledge of is bounded on the west by Baffin's bay, on the south by Davis's straits, and on the east by the northern part of the Atlantic ocean. It is a very mountainous country, and some parts of it so high that they may be discerned 30 leagues off at sea. The inland mountains, hills, and rocks, are covered with perpetual snow; but the low lands on the sea-side are clothed with verdure in the summer season. The coast abounds with inlets, bays, and large rivers; and is surrounded with a vast number of islands of different dimensions. In a great many places, however, on the eastern coast especially, the shore is inaccessible by reason of the floating mountains of ice. The principal river, called Baal, falls into the sea in the 64th degree of latitude, where the first Danish lodge was built in 1721; and has been navigated above 40 miles up the country.\n\nWell Greenland was first peopled by Europeans in Peopled by the eighth century. At that time a company of Ice—a colony landers, headed by one Ericke Rande, were by accident from Ice-driven on that coast. On his return he represented the land, country in such a favourable light, that some families again followed him thither, where they soon became a thriving colony, and bestowed on their new habitation the name of Greenland or Greenland, on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to Christianity by a missionary from Norway, sent thither by the celebrated Olaf, the first Norwegian monarch who embraced the true religion. The Greenland settlement continued to increase and thrive under his protection; and in a little time the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bishops, &c., under the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Drontheim. A considerable commerce was carried on between Greenland and Norway; and a regular intercourse maintained between the two countries till the year 1406, when All correspondence the last bishop was sent over. From that time all correspondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Greenland only cut off.\n\nThis strange and abrupt cessation of all trade and intercourse has been attributed to various causes; but the most probable is the following: The colony, from its first settlement, had been harried by the natives, a barbarous and savage people, agreeing in customs, garb, language, and appearance, with the Equimaux found about Hudson's bay. This nation, called Schrellings, at length prevailed against the Iceland settlers who inhabited the western district, and exterminated them in the 14th century: inasmuch, that when their brethren Colony fur of the eastern district came to their affluence, they found nothing alive but some cattle and flocks of sheep exterminating running wild about the country. Perhaps they themselves afterwards experienced the same fate, and were totally destroyed by these Schrellings, whose descendants still inhabit the western parts of Greenland, and from tradition confirm this conjecture. They affirm that the houses and villages, whose ruins still appear, were inhabited by a nation of strangers, whom their ancestors\nGreenland ancestors destroyed. There are reasons, however, for believing that there may be still some descendants of the ancient Iceland colony remaining in the eastern district, though they cannot be visited by land, on account of the stupendous mountains, perpetually covered with snow, which divide the two parts of Greenland; while they have been rendered inaccessible by sea, by the vast quantity of ice driven from Spitzbergen, or East Greenland. One would imagine that there must have been some considerable alteration in the northern parts of the world since the 15th century, so that the coast of Greenland is now become almost totally inaccessible, though formerly visited with very little difficulty. It is also natural to ask, By what means the people of the eastern colony surmounted the above-mentioned obstacles when they went to the assistance of their western friends; how they returned to their own country; and in what manner historians learned the success of their expedition? Concerning all this we have very little satisfactory information.\n\nAccount of All that can be learned from the most authentic records, is that Greenland was divided into two districts, called West Bygd and East Bygd: that the western division contained four parishes and 100 villages; that the eastern district was still more flourishing, as being nearer to Iceland, sooner settled, and more frequented by shipping from Norway. There are also many accounts, though most of them romantic and slightly attested, which render it probable that part of the eastern colony still subsists, who, at some time or other, may have given the imperfect relation above-mentioned. This colony, in ancient times, certainly comprehended twelve extensive parishes, one hundred and ninety villages, a bishop's see, and two monasteries. The present inhabitants of the western district are entirely ignorant of this part, from which they are divided by rocks, mountains, and deserts, and still more effectually by their apprehensions: for they believe the eastern Greenlanders to be a cruel, barbarous nation, that destroy and eat all strangers who fall into their hands. About a century after all intercourse between Norway and Greenland had ceased, several ships were sent successively by the kings of Denmark in order to discover the eastern district; but all of them miscarried. Among these adventurers, Mogens Heinson, after having surmounted many difficulties and dangers, got sight of the land; which, however, he could not approach. At his return, he pretended that the ship was arrested in the middle of her course by certain rocks of loadstone at the bottom of the sea. The same year, 1576, in which this attempt was made, has been rendered remarkable by the voyage of Captain Martin Frobisher, sent upon the same errand by Queen Elizabeth. He likewise desired the land; but could not reach it, and therefore returned to England; yet not before he had sailed sixty leagues in the strait Greenland, which still retains his name, and landed on several islands, where he had some communication with the natives. He had likewise taken possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth; and brought away some pieces of heavy black stone, from which the refiners of London extracted a certain proportion of gold. In the ensuing spring he undertook a second voyage, at the head of a small squadron, equipped at the expense of the public; entered the straits a second time; discovered upon an island a gold and silver mine; bestowed names upon different bays, islands, and headlands; and brought away a lading of ore, together with two natives, a male and a female, whom the English kidnapped.\n\nSuch was the success of this voyage, that another armament was fitted out under the auspices of Admiral Frobisher, consisting of 15 sail, including a considerable number of soldiers, miners, smelters, carpenters, and bakers, to remain all the winter near the mines in a wooden fort, the different pieces of which they carried out in the transports. They met with boisterous weather, impenetrable fogs, and violent currents upon the coast of Greenland, which retarded their operations until the season was far advanced. Part of their wooden fort was lost at sea; and they had neither provision nor fuel sufficient for the winter. The admiral therefore determined to return with as much ore as he could procure; of this they obtained large quantities out of a new mine, to which they gave the name of the Countess of Sussex. They likewise built a house of stone and lime, provided with ovens; and here, with a view to conciliate the affection of the natives, they left a quantity of small morrice-bells, knives, beads, looking-glasses, leaden pictures, and other toys, together with several loaves of bread. They buried the timber of the fort where it could be easily found next year; and sowed corn, peas, and other grain, by way of experiment, to know what the country would produce. Having taken these precautions, they sailed from there in the beginning of September; and after a month's stormy passage, arrived in England: but this noble design was never prosecuted.\n\nChristian IV. king of Denmark, being desirous of discovering the old Greenland settlement, sent three ships thither, under the command of Captain Godike Lindenow; who is said to have reached the east coast of Greenland, where he traded with the savage inhabitants, such as they are still found in the western district, but saw no signs of a civilized people. Had he actually landed in the eastern division, he must have perceived some remains of the ancient colony, even in the ruins of their convents and villages. Lindenow kidnapped two of the natives, who were conveyed to Copenhagen; and the same cruel fraud (a) was practised.\n\n(a) Nothing can be more inhuman and repugnant to the dictates of common justice than this practice of tearing away poor creatures from their country, their families, and connections; unless we suppose them altogether destitute of natural affection: and that this was not the case with those poor Greenlanders, some of whom were brought alive to Copenhagen, appears from the whole tenor of their conduct, upon their first capture, and during their confinement in Denmark. When first captivated, they rent the air with their cries and lamentations: they even leaped into the sea; and, when taken on board, for some time refused all sustenance. Their eyes were continually turned towards their dear country, and their faces always bathed in tears. Even\ntised by other two ships which sailed into Davis's straits, where they discovered divers fine harbours, and delightful meadows covered with verdure. In some places they are said to have found a considerable quantity of ore, every hundred pounds of which yielded twenty-five ounces of silver. The same Admiral Lindenow made another voyage to the coast of Greenland in the year 1606, directing his course to the westward of Cape Farewell. He coasted along the straits of Davis; and having made some observations on the face of the country, the harbours, and islands, returned to Denmark. Carsten Richards, being detached with two ships on the same discovery, descried the high land on the eastern side of Greenland; but was hindered by the ice from approaching the shore.\n\nOther expeditions of the same nature have been planned and executed with the same bad success, under the auspices of a Danish company of merchants. Two ships returned from the western part of Greenland loaded with a kind of yellow sand, supposed to contain a large proportion of gold. This being assayed by the goldsmiths of Copenhagen, was condemned as useless, and thrown overboard; but from a small quantity of this sand, which was referred as a curiosity, an expert chemist afterwards extracted a quantity of pure gold. The captain, who brought home this adventure, was so chagrined at his disappointment, that he died of grief, without having left any directions concerning the place where the sand had been discovered. In the year 1654, Henry Moller, a rich Dane, equipped a vessel under the command of David de Nelles, who sailed to the west coast of Greenland, from which he carried off three women of the country. Other efforts have been made, under the encouragement of the Danish king, for the discovery and recovery of the old Iceland colony in Greenland; but all of them miscarried, and people began to look upon such expeditions as wild and chimerical. At length the Greenland company at Bergen in Norway, transported a colony to the western coast, about the 64th degree of latitude; and these Norwegians failed in the year 1712, accompanied by the Reverend Hans Egede, to whose care, ability, and precision, we owe the best and most authentic account of modern Greenland.\n\nThis gentleman endeavoured to reach the eastern district, by coasting southwards, and advanced as far as the States promontory; but the season of the year, and continual storms, obliged him to return; and as he could not even find the strait of Frobisher, he concluded that no such place ever existed. In the year 1724, a ship, being equipped by the company, sailed on this discovery, with a view to land on the east side opposite to Iceland; but the vast floes of ice, which barricaded that part of the coast, rendered this scheme impracticable. His Danish majesty, in the year 1728, caused horses to be transported to Greenland, in hope that the settlers might by their means travel over land to the eastern district; but the icy mountains were found impassable. Finally, Lieutenant Richards, in a ship which had wintered near the new Danish colony, attempted, in his return to Denmark, to land on the eastern shore; but all his endeavours proved abortive.\n\nMr Egede is of opinion, that the only practicable method of reaching that part of the country, will be to coast north about in small vessels, between the great floes of ice and the shore; as the Greenlanders have declared, that the currents continually rushing from the bays and inlets, and running north-westwards along the shore, hinder the ice from adhering to the land; so that there is always a channel open, through which vessels of small burden might pass, especially if lodges were built at convenient distances on the shore, for the convenience and direction of the adventurers.\n\nThat part of the country which is now visited and settled by the Danes and Norwegians, lies between the 64th and 68th degrees of north latitude; and thus far it is said the climate is temperate. In the summer, which continues from the end of May to the middle of September, the weather is warm and comfortable, while the wind blows easterly; though even at this time storms frequently happen, which rage with incredible violence; and the sea-coasts are infested with fogs that are equally disagreeable and unhealthy.—Near the shore, and in the bays and inlets, the low land is clothed with the most charming verdure; but the inland mountains are perpetually covered with ice and snow. To the northward of the 68th degree of latitude the cold is prodigiously intense; and towards the end of August all the coast is covered with ice, which never thaws till April or May, and sometimes not till the latter end of June. Nothing can exhibit a more dreadful, and at the same time a more dazzling appearance, than those prodigious masses of ice that surround the whole coast in various forms, reflecting a multitude of colours from the sun-beams, and calling to mind the enchanted scenes of romance. Such prospects they yield in calm weather; but when the wind begins to blow, and the waves to rise in vast billows, the violent shocks of those pieces of ice dashing against one another, fill the mind with horror.—Greenland is seldom visited with thunder and lightning, but the Aurora Borealis is very frequent and bright. At the time of new and full moon, the tide rises and falls upon this coast.\n\nthe countenance of his Danish majesty, and the cares of the court and people, could not alleviate their grief. One of them was perceived to shed tears always when he saw an infant in the mother's arms; a circumstance from whence it was naturally concluded, that he had left his wife with a young child in Greenland. Two of them went to sea in their little canoes in hope of reaching Greenland; but one of them was retaken. Other two made the same attempt: but were driven by a storm on the coast of Schonen, where they were apprehended by the peasants, and reconveyed to Copenhagen. One of them afterwards died of a fever, caught in fishing pearl, during the winter, for the governor of Kolding. The rest lived some years in Denmark; but at length, seeing no prospect of being able to revisit their native country, they sunk into a kind of melancholy disorder, and expired.\nGreenland coast about three fathoms; and it is remarkable, that the springs and fountains on shore rise and fall with the flux and reflux of the ocean.\n\nThe soil of Greenland varies like that of all other mountainous countries. The hills are very barren, being indeed frozen throughout the whole year; but the valleys and low grounds, especially near the sea, are rich and fruitful. The ancient Norwegian chronicles inform us, that Greenland formerly produced a great number of cattle; and that considerable quantities of butter and cheese were exported to Norway; and, on account of their peculiar excellency, set apart for the king's use. The same histories inform us, that some parts of the country yielded excellent wheat; and that large oaks were found here, which carried acorns as big as apples. Some of these oaks still remain in the southern parts, and in many places the marks of ploughed land are easily perceived. At present, however, the country is destitute of corn and cattle, though in many places it produces excellent pasture; and, if properly cultivated, would probably yield grain also. Mr Egede sowed some barley in a bay adjoining to the Danish colony. It sprang up so fast, that by the latter end of July it was in the full ear; but being nipped by a night-frost, it never arrived at maturity. This seed was brought from Bergen, where the summer is of greater heat and duration than in Greenland; but in all probability the corn which grows in the northern parts of Norway would also thrive here. Turnips and coleworts of an excellent taste and flavour are also produced here. The sides of the mountains near the bays are clothed with wild thyme, which diffuses its fragrance to a great distance. The herb tormentil is very common in this country, and likewise many others not described by the botanists. Among the fruits of Greenland we number juniper-berries, blue-berries, bil-berries, and bramble-berries.\n\nGreenland is thought to contain many mines of metal, though none of them are wrought. To the southward of the Danish colony are some appearances of a mine of copper. Mr Egede once received a lump of ore from one of the natives; and here he found calamine of a yellow colour. He once sent a considerable quantity of sand of a yellow colour, intermixed with streaks of vermillion, to the Bergen company. They probably found their account in this present; for they desired him by a letter to procure as much of that sand as possible; but he was never able to find the place where he saw the first specimen. It was one of the smallest among a great number of islands; and the mark he had set up was blown down by a violent storm. Possibly this might be the same mineral of which Captain Frobisher brought so much to England. This country produces rock-crystals both red and white, and whole mountains of the asbestos or inflammable flax. Around the colony, which is known by the name of Good Hope, they find a kind of bastard marble of various colours, which the natives form into bowls, lamps, pots, &c. All that has been said of the fertility of Greenland, however, must be understood only of that part which lies between the 60th and 65th degrees of latitude. The most northern parts are totally destitute of herbs and plants. The wretched inhabitants cannot find grass in sufficient quantities to stuff into their shoes to keep their feet warm, but are obliged to buy it from those who inhabit the more southern parts.\n\nThe animals which abound most in Greenland are, rein-deer, foxes, hares, dogs, and white bears. The hares are of a white colour, and very fat; the foxes are of different colours, white, grayish, and bluish; and smaller than those of Denmark and Norway. The natives keep a great number of dogs, which are large, white, or speckled, and rough, with ears standing upright, as is the case with all the dogs peculiar to cold climates. They are timorous and stupid; and neither bay nor bark, but sometimes howl dismally. In the northern parts the natives yoke them in sledges; which, though heavy laden, they will draw on the ice at the rate of 70 miles in a short winter's day. These poor animals are very ill rewarded for their service; being left to provide for themselves, except when their masters happen to catch a great number of seals. On these occasions the dogs are regaled with the blood and entrails; at other times they subsist, like wild beasts, upon mussels and berries. Here also are found great numbers of ravens, eagles of a prodigious size, falcons, and other birds of prey; and likewise a kind of linnet, which warbles very melodiously. Whales, sword-fish, porpoises, &c., abound on the coasts; also halibut, turbot, cod, haddock, &c.\n\nThe people who now inhabit the western coast of Greenland, and who, without doubt, are the descendants of the ancient Schrelingi, who exterminated the inhabitants of the ancient Iceland colony, bear a near resemblance to the Samoiedes and Laplanders in their persons, complexions, and way of life. They are short, brawny, and inclined to corpulency; with broad faces, flat noses, thick lips, black hair and eyes, and a yellowish tawny complexion. They are for the most part vigorous and healthy, but remarkably short-lived; few of them reaching the grand climacteric; and many dying in their infancy, and in the prime of youth. They are subject to a weakness in the eyes, occasioned by the piercing winds and the glare of the snow in the winter time. The leprosy is known among them, but is not contagious. Those that dwell in the northern parts are miserably tormented with dysenteries, rheums, and pulmonary disorders, boils, and epilepsy. The smallpox being imported among them from Copenhagen in the year 1734, made terrible havoc among these poor people, who are utterly destitute of any knowledge of the medicinal art, and depend entirely for affluence upon their angels or conjurers. In their dispositions the Greenlanders are cold, phlegmatic, indolent, and slow of apprehension; but very quiet, orderly, and good-natured. They live peaceably together; and have everything in common, without strife, envying, or animosity. They are civil and hospitable, but frivolously to a degree almost beyond the Hottentots themselves. They never wash themselves with water; but lick their paws like the cat, and then rub their faces with them. They eat after their dogs without washing their dishes; devour the lice which devour them; and even lick the sweat, which they scrape off from their faces with their knives. The women wash themselves with their own urine, which they imagine makes their hair grow; and in the winter-time go out immediately after, to let the liquor freeze upon their skin.\nThey will often eat their victuals off the dirty ground, without any vessel to hold them in; and devour rotten flesh with the greatest avidity. In times of scarcity they will subsist on pieces of old skin, reeds, seaweed, and a root called tugloronet, dressed with train-oil and fat. The dung of reindeer taken from the intestines, the entrails of partridges, and all sorts of offals, are counted dainties among these savages; and of the scrapings of seal skins they make delicate pan-cakes. At first they could not taste the Danish provisions without abhorrence; but now they are become extremely fond of bread and butter, though they still retain an aversion to tobacco and spirituous liquors; in which particular they differ from almost all savages on the face of the earth.\n\nThe Greenlanders commonly content themselves with one wife; who is condemned, as among other savage nations, to do all the drudgery, and may be corrected, or even divorced, by the husband at pleasure. Heroes, however, and extraordinary personages, are indulged with a plurality of wives. Their young women are generally chaste and faithful; but at some of their feasts, in the midst of their jollity, a man retires with his neighbour's wife behind a curtain made of skins; and all the guests, thus coupled, retire in their turns. The women think themselves happy if an angekut or prophet will thus honour them with his cares. These people never marry within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity, nor is it counted decent in a couple to marry who have been educated in the same family.—They have a number of ridiculous and superstitious customs; among which the two following are the most remarkable. While a woman is in labour the gossips hold a chamber-pot over her head, as a charm to hasten the delivery. When the child is a year old, the mother licks and slathers it all over, to render it, as she imagines, more strong and hardy.\n\nAll the Greenlanders hitherto known speak the same language, though different dialects prevail in different parts of the country. It abounds with double consonants; and is so guttural, that the pronunciation of many words is not to be learned except by those who have been accustomed to it from their infancy. The letters C, D, F, Q, and X, are not known in their alphabet. Like the North Americans, and inhabitants of Kamtschatka, they have a great number of long polyyllables. Their words, nouns as well as verbs, are inflected at the end by varying the termination, without the help of articles: but their language being found defective, they have adopted a good many words from the Norwegian dialect. Notwithstanding the endeavours of the Danish missionaries, they have no great reason to boast of the profelytes they have made of the natives of Greenland. These savages pay great deference and respect to the Danes, whom indeed they obey as their masters, and hear the truths of the Christian religion expounded without doubting the veracity of their teachers; but at the same time they listen with the most mortifying indifference, without being in the least influenced by what they have heard. They believe in the immortality of the soul, and the existence of a spirit whom they call Torngarfsuk; but of whom they have formed the most ridiculous notions. The angekuts, who are supposed to be his immediate ministers, differ concerning the principles of his existence; some affirming that he is without form or shape; others, that he has the shape of a bear; others, that he has a large human body with only one arm; while others affirm that he is no larger than a man's finger, with many other absurdities of a similar kind. They have also a peculiar kind of mythology, by which they believe all the elements to be full of spirits, from among which every one of their prophets is supplied with a familiar which they name Torngarfsuk, and who is always ready when summoned to his assistance.\n\nThe Greenlanders are employed all the year round either in fishing or hunting. At sea they pursue the whales, morays, seals, fish for eating, and sea fowl. On shore they hunt the rein-deer in different parts of the country. They drive these animals, which feed in large herds, into a narrow circle or defile, where they are easily slain with arrows. Their bow is made of fir-tree, wound about with the twisted sinews of animals; the string is composed of the same fluff, or of seal skin: the arrow is a full fathom in length, pointed with a bearded iron, or a sharp bone; but those with which they kill birds are blunt, that they may not tear the flesh. Sea-fowls they kill with lances, which they throw to a great distance with surprising dexterity. Their manner of catching whales is quite different from that practised by the Europeans. About 50 persons, men and women, set out in one long boat, which is called a kone-boat, from kone, a \"woman,\" because it is rowed by females only. When they find a whale, they strike him with harpoons, to which are fastened with long lines, some seal skins blown up like bladders. These, by floating on the surface, not only discover the back of the whale, but hinder him from diving under water for any length of time. They continue to pursue him until he loses strength, when they pierce him with spears and lances till he expires. On this occasion they are clad in their spring coats, consisting of one piece, with gloves, boots, caps made of seal-skin so closely laced and sewed that they keep out water. Thus accoutred, they leap into the sea; and begin to slice off the fat, even under water, before the whale is dead.—They have many different ways of killing seals; namely, by striking them with a small harpoon equipped also with an air-bag; by watching them when they come to breathe at the air-holes in the ice, and striking them with spears; by approaching them in the disguise of their own species, that is, covered with a seal-skin, creeping upon the ice, and moving the head from side to side as the seals are accustomed to do. By this stratagem, the Greenlanders move towards the unsuspecting seal, and kills him with a spear. The Greenlanders angle with lines made of whale-bone cut very small, by means of which they succeed wonderfully. The Greenland canoe, like that used in Nova Zembla and Hudson's bay, is about three fathoms in length, pointed at both ends, and three quarters of a yard in breadth. It is composed of thin rafts fastened together with the sinews of animals. It is covered with dressed seal-skins both below and above, in such a manner that only a circular hole is left in the middle, large enough to admit the body of one man. Into this the Greenlanders thrusts himself up to the waist, and fastens the skin so tight about...\nGreenland, about him that no water can enter. Thus secured, and armed with a paddle broad at both ends, he will venture out to sea in the most stormy weather to catch seals and sea-fowl; and if he is overfed, he can easily raise himself by means of his paddle. A Greenlander in one of these canoes, which was brought with him to Copenhagen, outstripped a pinnace of 16 oars, manned with choice mariners.—The canoe-boat is made of the same materials, but more durable; and so large, that it will contain 50 persons with all their tackle, baggage, and provisions. She is fitted with a mast, which carries a triangular sail made of the membranes and entrails of seals, and is managed without the help of braces and bowlines. These canoes are flat bottomed, and sometimes 60 feet in length. The men think it beneath them to take charge of them; and therefore they are left to the conduct of the women, who indeed are obliged to do all the drudgery, including even the building and repairing their houses, while the men employ themselves wholly in preparing their hunting implements and fishing tackle.\n\nThis country is but thinly inhabited. In the winter time the people dwell in huts built of stone or turf: on the one side are the windows, covered with the skins of seals or rein-deer. Several families live in one of these houses, possessing each a separate apartment, before which is a hearth with a great lamp placed on a trevity, over which hangs their kettle: above is a rack or shelf on which their wet clothes are dried. They burn train oil in their lamps; and instead of wick, they use a kind of moss, which fully answers the purpose. These fires are not only sufficient to boil their victuals; but likewise to produce such a heat, that the whole house is like a bagnio. The door is very low, that as little cold air as possible may be admitted. The house within is lined with old skins, and surrounded with benches for the convenience of strangers. In the summer-time, they dwell in tents made of long poles fixed in a conical form, covered in the inside with deer skins, and on the outside with seal skins, dressed so that the rain cannot pierce them.\n\nEast Greenland was for a long time considered as a part of the continent of West Greenland, but is now discovered to be an assemblage of islands lying between 76° 46' and 80° 30' of north latitude, and between 9° and 20° of east longitude. It was discovered by Sir Hugh Willoughby in the year 1553, who called it Greenland; supposing it to be a part of the western continent. In 1595, it was again visited by William Barentz and John Cornelius, two Dutchmen, who pretended to be the original discoverers, and called the country Spitzbergen, or Sharp Mountains, from the many sharp pointed and rocky mountains with which it abounds. They alleged that the coast discovered by Sir Hugh Willoughby was some other country; which accordingly the Hollanders delineated on their maps and charts by the name of Willoughby Land; whereas in fact no such land ever existed; and long before the voyage of these Dutchmen, Stephen Barrows, an English shipmaster, had coasted along a desolate country from N. Lat. 78° to 80° 11', which was undoubtedly Spitzbergen. The sea in the neighbourhood of the islands of Spitzbergen abounds very much with whales, and is the common resort of the whale-Greenland fishing ships from different countries, and the country itself is frequently visited by these ships; but till the voyage of the Hon. Capt. Phipps (afterwards Lord Mulgrave), by order of his majesty, the situation of it was erroneously laid down. It was imagined that the land stretched to the northward as far as 82° of north latitude; but Capt. Phipps found the most northerly point of land, called Seven Islands, not to exceed 80° 30' of latitude. Towards the east he saw other lands lying at a distance, so that Spitzbergen plainly appeared to be surrounded by water on that side, and not joined to the continent of Asia, as former navigators had supposed. The north and west coasts also he explored, but was prevented by the ice from sailing so far to the northward as he wished. The coast appeared neither habitable nor accessible. It is formed of high, barren, black rocks, without the least marks of vegetation; in many places bare and pointed; in others covered with snow, appearing even above the clouds. The valleys between the high cliffs were filled with snow and ice.\n\n\"This prospect,\" says Capt. Phipps, \"would have suggested the idea of perpetual winter, had not the mildness of the weather, the smooth water, bright sunshine, and constant day-light, given a cheerfulness and novelty to the whole of this romantic scene.\" The current ran along this coast half a knot an hour north. The height of one mountain seen here was found by geometrical mensuration to be at one time 1503½ feet, at another 1503½ feet. By a barometer constructed after De Luc's method, the height was found to be 1588½ feet. On this occasion Capt. Phipps has the following remarks. \"I can account for the great difference between the geometrical measure and the barometrical according to M. de Luc's calculation, which amounts to 84½ feet. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of Dr Irving's observations, which were made with great care. As to the geometrical measure, the agreement of so many triangles, each of which must have discovered even the smallest error, is the most satisfactory proof of its correctness. Since my return I have tried both the theodolite and barometer, to discover whether there was any fault in either; and find them, upon trial, as I had always done before, very accurate.\"\n\nThere is good anchorage in Schmeerburgh harbour, lying in N. Lat. 74° 44', E. Long. 9° 50' 45\", in 13 fathoms, sandy bottom, not far from the shore, and well sheltered from all winds. Close to this harbour is an island called Amsterdam Island, where the Dutch used formerly to boil their whale-oil; and the remains of some conveniency erected by them for that purpose are still visible. The Dutch ships, excepting in time of war, still resort to this place for the last feston of the whale-fishery.—The rocks about this place are chiefly a kind of marble or limestone. No appearances of metals were observed, nor any signs of ancient or modern volcanoes. No insects, or any species of reptiles, were seen, not even the common earth-worm. There were no springs or rivers; but great plenty of water was produced from the snow which melted on the mountains.\n\nThe most remarkable views which these dreary regions present are those called Icebergs. They are large bodies of ice filling the valleys between the high mountains.\nGRE\n\nGreenland, mountains. Their face towards the sea is nearly perpendicular, and of a very lively light-green colour. One was about 300 feet high, with a cascade of water issuing from it. The black mountains on each side, the white snow, and greenish coloured ice, composed a very beautiful and romantic picture. Large pieces frequently broke off from the icebergs, and fell with great noise into the water. One piece was observed to have floated out into the bay, and grounded in 24 fathoms; it was 50 feet high above the surface of the water, and of the same beautiful colour with the iceberg from which it had separated.\n\nThese islands are totally uninhabited, though it doth not appear but that human creatures could subsist on them, notwithstanding their vicinity to the pole.—Eight English sailors, who were accidentally left here by a whale-fishing ship, survived the winter, and were brought home next season. The Dutch then attempted to settle a colony on Amsterdam island above mentioned; but all the people perished, not through the severity of the climate, but of the scurvy, owing to the want of those remedies which are now happily discovered, and which are found to be so effectual in preventing and curing that dreadful disease.—The late account also of six Russian sailors who staid four years in this inhospitable country, affords a decisive proof, that a colony might be settled on East Greenland, provided the doing so could answer any good purpose.\n\nGREENLAND Company. A joint stock of 40,000l. was by statute to be raised by subscribers, who were incorporated for 14 years from the first of October 1693, and the company to use the trade of catching whales, &c. into and from Greenland, and the Greenland seas; they may make bye-laws for the government of the persons employed in their ships, &c. Stat. 4 and 5 W. III. cap. 17. This company was farther encouraged by parliament in 1696; but partly by unskilful management, and partly by real losses, it was under the necessity of entirely breaking up, before the expiration of the term assigned to it, ending in 1707. But any person who will adventure to Greenland for whale-fishing, shall have all privileges granted to the Greenland company, by 1 Anne, cap. 16, and thus the trade was again laid open. Any subject may import whale-fins, oil, &c. of fish caught in the Greenland seas, without paying any customs, &c. Stat. 10 Geo. I. cap. 16. And ships employed in the Greenland-fishery are to be of such burden, provided with boats, so many men, fishing-lines, harping irons, &c. and be licensed to proceed; and on their return shall be paid 20s. per ton bounty, for whale-fins, &c. imported; 6 Geo. II. cap. 33. The bounty was afterwards increased; but has been lately diminished, and since this diminution, the trade has increased. See Whale-Fishery.\n\nGREENOCK, a sea-port town of Scotland, and one of the ports of the city of Glasgow. It is distant 22 miles from that city. The frith of Clyde here expands into a fine basin four miles wide, and is landlocked on all sides.\n\nGreenock is divided into what are called the old and new parishes. Certain lands were disjoined from Innerkip and Houston, in the year 1636, by virtue of a petition from the proprietors to the lords of commission for plantation of kirks, &c. which received the name of Greenock when erected into a parish. There are different opinions entertained respecting the origin of the name, but the most probable opinion is, that it is derived from the Gaelic Grianeg, which signifies the bay of the sun. It lies in the north-west part of the county of Renfrew, in the presbytery of Paisley, and synod of Glasgow and Ayr, with the frith of Clyde on the north.\n\nThe parish of Greenock is hilly, with the exception of a small strip of level ground of various breadths, stretching along the shore. It abounds with peat for fuel to the inhabitants, vast quantities of which they can afford to dispose of to the neighbouring towns and villages.\n\nThe soil upon the shore is full of gravel, light and sandy, which needs much rain to produce even a tolerable crop. It produces, however, large quantities of excellent potatoes, and by the affluence of sea ware, much good barley and oats.\n\nAs far as is yet known, the parish of Greenock produces no minerals which are in the least remarkable. Freestone is the most common to be met with, while limestone, which has been but lately discovered, has been found in very small quantities. No traces of coal have yet been met with, and the hills contain no metallic substances, except iron-stone of a poor quality, and a little copper, which is rarely found in freestone.\n\nIn descending from the hills, there are some rivulets which form beautiful cascades, and appear like wreaths of snow, when seen from the shore. The chief of them bears the name of Wallace, the celebrated champion of the liberties of Scotland.\n\nOn the west side of the bay of Greenock and Crawfordside, formerly denominated the bay of St Lawrence, from a chapel in the vicinity consecrated to that saint, lies the new town of Greenock. In the beginning of the 18th century it consisted only of one row of houses covered with thatch, and had no vestige of a harbour for vessels; but at present it extends along the Clyde rather more than an English mile, but not more than a furlong in breadth. Before the year 1745, a new parish was erected in Greenock, by the permission of Sir John Shaw, who gave up to the heritors and elders the right of patronage.\n\nBoth the parishes did not contain more than 4000 persons about the year 1745, and in 10 years after, they had suffered a diminution of 142 persons, as appears from the return transmitted to Dr Webster. The increase of population has been rapid since that time, being now estimated at upwards of 15,000 souls.\n\nPeople of opulence in Greenock, and even those whose circumstances are much more circumscribed, have the valuable character of being uncommonly generous and liberal, which dispositions it is said, have been more tried than those of almost any other class of people in Scotland. The annual amount of charitable donations for the relief of the poor is not less than 1200l. sterling. The Merchants House Society was erected in 1787, for admission into which every member pays 5l. 5s.; and 5s. a year afterwards. The funds are not to be touched till they amount to 1000l. at which time the interest may be distributed among decayed members. There are in Greenock a chapel of ease, a Gaelic chapel,\nThe town of Greenock is governed by a council of nine elders, of whom two are bailies. It is a burgh of barony, erected by Sir John Shaw in the year 1757, who was at that time superior. The inhabitants of Greenock petitioned the Scotch parliament in 1700, for a fund to build a harbour, which was absolutely and unaccountably refused. This made them enter into a contract with Sir John Shaw, paying a voluntary assessment of fifteen pence on each pack of malt brewed into ale within the limits of the town. In the year 1740 the whole debt was extinguished, and a surplus remained of £27,000.\n\nIn Greenock there are several dock manufactories, three soap and candle works, one saddle and shoe manufacture, and two sugar-houses, all carried on for exportation to a great extent.\n\nIn the year 1784, after peace with America, 436 vessels British and foreign, including outward and homeward bound, carrying 14,911 tons, were entered at the port of Greenock; and in 1791, there were 1962 vessels, the tonnage of which amounted to 31,704. From January 1790 to 1791, there were imported of grain, 87,395 quarters, 81,674 cwt. of sugar, 1,757,524 lbs. of cotton, 221,649 gallons of rum, and 744 tons of different wines.\n\nGREENWICH, a town of the county of Kent, in England, pleasantly situated on the bank of the Thames, about five miles east from London. Here was formerly a royal palace, built by Humphry duke of Gloucester, enlarged by Henry VII, and completed by Henry VIII. The latter often chose this town for his place of residence; as did also the queens Mary and Elizabeth, who were born in it. The same Duke Humphry began a tower on the top of the steep hill in the park, which was finished by Henry VII, but afterwards demolished, and a royal observatory erected in its place by Charles II, furnished with mathematical instruments for astronomical observations, and a deep dry well for observing the stars in the daytime. The palace being afterwards much neglected, King Charles II, (who had enlarged the park, walled it about and planted it), pulled it down, and began another, of which he lived to see the first wing magnificently finished. But King William III, in 1694, granted it, with nine acres of ground thereto belonging, to be converted into a royal hospital for old and disabled seamen, the widows and children of those who lost their lives in the service, and for the encouragement of navigation. This wing, which cost King Charles £6,000, is now the first wing of the hospital towards London. The front to the Thames consists of two ranges of stone buildings, with the ranger's house in the centre of the area, but detached from any part of the hospital. These buildings perfectly correspond with each other, and have their tops crowned with a stone balustrade. The buildings which are facing the area, correspond with them, though in a finer and more elegant style; and have domes at their ends, which are 120 feet high, supported on coupled columns. Under one of these is the hall, which is finely painted by Sir James Thornhill, and contains many royal portraits; and under the other the chapel, which by accident was destroyed by fire. This fire broke out in the hospital on the second of January 1779, and Greenwich totally consumed the dome at the S.E. quarter of the building, with the chapel which was the most elegant in the world, the great dining hall, and eight wards, containing the lodgings of near 600 pensioners. The dome was rebuilt about the year 1785; but the reparation of the whole damage is not yet completed. On the sides of the gate which opens to the buildings from the park, are placed a large terrestrial and celestial globe, in which the stars are gilt; and in the centre of the area is a statue of George II. About 2000 old disabled seamen are maintained in this hospital. Besides private benefactions, to the amount of near £6,000l. (which appear in tables hung up at the entrance of the hall,) the parliament, in the year 1732, settled upon it the earl of Derwentwater's estate, to the value of £600l. per annum. All strangers who see it, pay twopence each; and this income is applied to the support of the mathematical school for the sons of sailors. For the better support of which, every seaman in the royal navy, and in the merchant service, pays sixpence a month, stopped out of their pay, and delivered in at the six-penny receiver's office in Tower-hill. On this account, a seaman, who can produce an authentic certificate of his being disabled, and rendered unfit for service, by defending any ship belonging to his majesty's British subjects, or in taking any ship from the enemy, may be admitted into this hospital, and receive the same benefit from it as if he had been in his majesty's immediate service. Besides the seamen and widows above-mentioned, about 100 boys, the sons of seamen, are bred up for the service of the royal navy; but there are no out-pensioners as at Chelsea. Each of the mariners has a weekly allowance of seven loaves, weighing 16 ounces each; three pounds of beef, two of mutton, a pint of pease, a pound and a quarter of cheese, two ounces of butter, fourteen quarts of beer, and one shilling a-week tobacco-money; the tobacco-money of the boatman is two shillings and sixpence a-week each, that of their mates one shilling and sixpence, and that of the other officers in proportion to their rank; besides which, each common pensioner receives once in two years, a suit of blue clothes, a hat, three pairs of stockings, two pairs of shoes, five neckcloths, three shirts, and two night-caps. Out of all that is given for flowing the hall, only three-pence in the shilling is allowed to the person that shows them; the rest makes an excellent fund for the yearly maintenance of not less than 20 poor boys, who are the sons of mariners that have been either slain or disabled in the service of their country. The park is well stocked with deer, and affords as much variety, in proportion to its size, as any in the kingdom; but the views from the Observatory and the One-tree hill are beautiful beyond imagination, particularly the former. The projection of these hills is so bold, that you do not look down upon a gradually falling slope or flat inclosures, but at once upon the tops of branching trees, which grow in knots and clumps out of deep hollows and embrowned dells. The cattle which feed on the lawns, which appear in breaks among them, seem moving in a region of fairy land. A thousand natural openings among the branches of the trees break upon little picturesque views of the swelling turf, which, when illumined by the sun, have an effect pleasing beyond the power\npower of fancy to paint. This is the fore-ground of the landscape: a little farther, the eye falls on that noble structure the hospital, in the midst of an amphitheatre of wood; then the two reaches of the river make that beautiful serpentine which forms the Isle of Dogs, and present the floating millions of the Thames. To the left appears a fine tract of country, leading to the capital, which there finishes the prospect. The parish-church of Greenwich, rebuilt by the commissioners for erecting the 50 new churches, is a very handsome structure, dedicated to St Alphege, archbishop of Canterbury, who is said to have been slain by the Danes in the year 1012, on the spot where the church now stands. There is a college at the end of the town, fronting the Thames, for the maintenance of 20 decayed old house-keepers, 12 out of Greenwich, and eight who are to be alternately chosen from Snottisham and Cattle-Rhing in Norfolk. This is called the duke of Norfolk's College, though it was founded and endowed in 1613 by Henry earl of Northampton, the duke of Norfolk's brother, and by him committed to the care of the Mercers company. To this college belongs a chapel, in which the earl's body is laid; which, as well as his monument, was removed hither a few years ago from the chapel of Dover castle. The pensioners, besides meat, drink, and lodging, are allowed one shilling and sixpence a-week, with a gown every year, linen once in two years, and hats once in four years. In 1560, Mr Lambard, author of the Perambulation of Kent, also built an hospital, called Queen Elizabeth's college, said to be the first erected by an English Protestant. There are likewise two charity-schools in this parish. The river Thames is here very broad, and the channel deep; and at some very high tides the water is salt. This is the chief harbour for the king's yachts. The town contains about 1500 houses; and a market on Wednesday and Saturday was erected here in 1737, the direction of which is in the governors of the royal hospital, to which the profits arising from it were to be appropriated.\n\nGREGARIOUS, among zoologists, a term applied to such animals as do not live solitary, but associate in herds or flocks.\n\nGREGORIAN CALENDAR, that which shows the new and full moon, with the time of Easter, and the moveable feasts depending thereon, by means of epacts, disposed through the several months of the Gregorian year. See CHRONOLOGY, No. 26.\n\nGREGORIAN TELESCOPE. See OPTICS INDEX.\n\nGREGORIAN YEAR. See CHRONOLOGY, No. 26.\n\nGREGORY the Great, was born at Rome of a patrician family. He discovered such abilities in the exercise of the senatorial employments, that the emperor Justin the younger appointed him prefect of Rome. Pope Pelagius II. sent him nuncio to Constantinople, to demand succour against the Lombards. When he thought of enjoying a solitary life, he was elected pope by the clergy, the senate, and the people of Rome. Besides his learning and diligence in instructing the church, both by writing and preaching, he had a very happy talent in winning over princes in favour of the temporal as well as spiritual interest of religion. He undertook the conversion of the English, and sent over some monks of his order, under the direction of Augustin their abbot. His morality with respect to the chastity of churchmen was very rigid, afflicting that Gregory, a man who had ever known a woman ought not to be admitted to the priesthood; and he always caused the candidates for it to be examined upon that point. He likewise vigorously exerted himself against such as were found guilty of calumny. However, he flattered the emperor Phocas, while his hands were yet reeking with the blood of Mauritius, and of his three children, who had been butchered in his flight. He likewise flattered Brunehaut, a very wicked queen of France. He is accused of destroying the noble monuments of ancient Roman magnificence, that those who visited the city might not attend more to the triumphal arches than to holy things; and burnt a multitude of heathen books, Livy in particular. He died in 604.\n\nGREGORY of Nazianzen, surnamed the Divine, was one of the most illustrious ornaments of the Greek church in the fourth age. He was made bishop of Constantinople in 379; but finding his election contested by Timotheus archbishop of Alexandria, he voluntarily resigned his dignity about 382, in the general council of Constantinople. His works are extant, in two volumes, printed at Paris in 1609. His style is said to be equal to that of the most celebrated orators of ancient Greece.\n\nGREGORY, Theodorus, surnamed Thaumaturgus on account of his miracles, was the scholar of Origen; and was elected bishop of Neocaesarea, the place of his birth, about the year 240, during his absence. He assisted at the council of Antioch, in 255, against Paulus Samosetanus; and died in 270. He had the satisfaction of leaving only seventeen idolaters in his diocese, where there were but seventeen Christians when he was ordained. There is still extant of his, A gratulatory oration to Origen, A canonical epistle, and some other works.\n\nGREGORY, bishop of Nyssa, one of the fathers of the church, and author of the Nicene creed, was born in Cappadocia, about the year 331. He was chosen bishop of Nyssa in 372, and banished by the emperor Valens for adhering to the council of Nice. He was nevertheless afterwards employed by the bishops in several important affairs, and died in 396. He wrote Commentaries on the Scriptures; Sermons on the mysteries; Moral discourses; Dogmatical treatises; Panegyrics on the saints; some letters on church discipline; and other works. His style is very allegorical and affected.\n\nGREGORY of Tours, or Georgius Florentius Gregorius, one of the most illustrious bishops and celebrated writers of the fifth century, was descended from a noble family in Auvergne. He was educated by his uncle Gallus, bishop of Clermont; and distinguished himself so much by his learning and virtue, that in 573 he was chosen bishop of Tours. He afterwards went to Rome to visit the tomb of the apostles, where he contracted a friendship with Gregory the Great, and died in 595. This author was extremely credulous with regard to miracles. He wrote, 1. The history of France. 2. The lives of the saints; and other works. The best edition is that published by Father Rumart, 1699.\n\nGREGORY, David, the son of the reverend John Gregory, minister of Drumoak, in the county of Aberdeen.\nGregory. dean. He was born about the year 1628, educated by his father for busines, and bound apprentice to a mer-\ncantile house in Holland. But as his love of letters exceeded his desire for money, he relinquished commerce in the year 1655, and on the death of an elder brother he succeeded to the estate of Kinneiride, about 40 miles from Aberdeen, where he resided many years, and had no fewer than 32 children born to him by two wives. Three of his sons became eminent for their extensive literature, and were at one time professors of mathematics in the universities of Oxford, Edinburgh, and St Andrews.\n\nThe neighbouring gentlemen made a jest of Mr Gregory for his ignorance of what was doing on his own farm, but esteemed him highly as a man of letters. Having studied physic merely for amusement, he practised gratis among the poor; and his knowledge of it being so extensive, he was employed by the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood, but he would take no fees. Having much business during the day, he went very early to bed, rose to his studies about two or three in the morning, and then slept an hour or two before breakfast.\n\nIn the country where he dwelt he was the first person who had a barometer, to the changes in which, according to the changes in the weather, he paid great attention, and was once in great danger of being tried by the presbytery for witchcraft or conjuration. He was waited upon by a deputation of ministers, who inquired into the truth of certain reports which had come to their ears, whom he so far satisfied as to induce them to waive a prosecution against a man who, by the extensive knowledge of medicine which he possessed, was a public blessing to the country.\n\nAbout the beginning of last century he removed to Aberdeen, and during Queen Anne's war he turned his attention to the improvement of artillery, to make great guns more destructive, and executed a model of his intended engine. We are informed by Dr Reid, that he knew a clock-maker who had been employed in making this model; but as he made so many different pieces without knowing their design, or the method of uniting them, he could give no confident account of the whole. Mr Gregory being satisfied with his invention by various experiments, he desired his son to show it to Sir Isaac Newton, concealing the name of the inventor; but Sir Isaac was much displeased with it, and declared that the inventor was more entitled to punishment than reward, as it was solely calculated for destruction, and might come to be known to the enemy. That great man urged the necessity of destroying it, and it is probable that Mr Gregory's son, the Savilian professor, followed his advice, for the model was never found.\n\nWhen the rebellion broke out in 1715, the old gentleman went a second time to Holland, and returned when it was over to Aberdeen, where he died about 1720, in the 93rd year of his age, leaving behind him a history of his own times, which was never published.\n\nGregory, James, one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 17th century, was a son of the Rev. Mr John Gregory minister of Drumoak in the county of Aberdeen, and was born at Aberdeen in 1638. His mother was a daughter of Mr David Anderson of Finzaugh, a gentleman who possessed a singular turn for mathematical and mechanical knowledge. This genius was hereditary in the family of the Gregories, and from them seems to have been transmitted to their descendants of the name of Gregory. Alexander Anderson, cousin-german of the above-mentioned David, was professor of mathematics at Paris in the beginning of the 17th century, and published there in 1612, Supplementum Apollonii redivi, &c. The mother of James Gregory inherited the genius of her family; and observing in her son, while yet a child, a strong propensity to mathematics, she instructed him herself in the elements of that science. He received his education in the languages at the grammar-school of Aberdeen, and went through the usual course of academical studies in the Marischal college.\n\nAt the age of 24 he published his treatise, entitled Optica Promota, seu abdita radiorum reflexorum et refractorum mysteria, geometricè enucleata; cui subnecitur appendix subtilissimorum affrononim problematum resolutionem exhibens, London 1663; a work of great genius, in which he gave the world an invention of his own, and one of the most valuable of the modern discoveries, the construction of the reflecting telescope. This discovery immediately attracted the attention of the mathematicians, both of our own and of foreign countries, who were soon convinced of its great importance to the sciences of optics and astronomy. The manner of placing the two specula upon the same axis appearing to Sir Isaac Newton to be attended with the disadvantage of losing the central rays of the larger speculum, he proposed an improvement on the instrument, by giving an oblique position to the smaller speculum, and placing the eye-glass in the side of the tube. But it is worth remarking, that the Newtonian construction of that instrument was long abandoned for the original or Gregorian, which is at this day universally employed where the instrument is of a moderate size; though Mr Herschel has preferred the Newtonian form for the construction of those immense telescopes, which of late years he has so successfully employed in observing the heavens.\n\nThe university of Padua being at that time in high reputation for mathematical studies, James Gregory went thither soon after the publication of his first work; and fixing his residence there for some years, he published, in 1667, Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae quadratura; in which he propounded another discovery of his own, the invention of an infinitely converging series for the areas of the circle and hyperbola. To this treatise, when republished in 1668, he added a new work, entitled, Geometricè pars universalis, infervens quantitatum curvarum transmutationi et mensurae; in which he is allowed to have thrown, for the first time, a method for the transmutation of curves. These works engaged the notice, and procured Mr Gregory the correspondence, of the greatest mathematicians of the age, Newton, Huygens, Halley, and Wallis; and their author being soon after chosen a fellow of the royal society of London, contributed to enrich the Philosophical Transactions at that time by many excellent papers. Through this channel, in particular, he carried on a dispute with Mr Huygens, upon the occasion of his treatise on the quadrature of the circle and hyperbola, to which\nGregory, which that able mathematician had started some objections. Of this controversy, it is unnecessary to enter into particulars. It is sufficient to say, that, in the opinion of Leibnitz, who allows Mr Gregory the highest merit for his genius and discoveries, Mr Huygens has pointed out, though not errors, some considerable deficiencies in the treatise above mentioned, and shown a much simpler method of attaining the end in view.\n\nIn 1668, Mr James Gregory published at London another work, entitled *Exercitationes Geometricae*, which contributed still to extend his reputation. About this time he was elected professor of mathematics in the university of St Andrew's; an office which he held for six years. During his residence there, he married, in 1669, Mary, the daughter of George Jamison the celebrated painter, whom Mr Walpole has termed the Vandyke of Scotland, and who was fellow-disciple with that great artist in the school of Rubens at Antwerp.\n\nIn 1674, he was called to Edinburgh, to fill the chair of mathematics in that university. This place he had held for little more than a year, when, in October 1675, being employed in showing the satellites of Jupiter through a telescope to some of his pupils, he was suddenly struck with total blindness, and died a few days after, at the early age of 37.\n\nHe was a man of an acute and penetrating genius. His temper seems to have been warm, as appears from the conduct of his dispute with Mr Huygens; and, conscious perhaps of his own merits as a discoverer, he seems to have been jealous of losing any portion of his reputation by the improvements of others upon his inventions.\n\n**Gregory, David**, Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, whom Dr Smith has termed *subtilissimi ingenii mathematici*, was the eldest son of Mr Gregory of Kinmaid, brother of the above-mentioned Mr James Gregory. He was born at Aberdeen in 1661, and received the earlier parts of his education in that city. He completed his studies at Edinburgh; and, being possessed of the mathematical papers of his uncle, soon distinguished himself likewise as the heir of his genius. In the 23rd year of his age, he was elected professor of mathematics in the university of Edinburgh; and published, in the same year, *Exercitatio Geometrica de dimensione figurarum, five specimen methodi generalis diometriendi quasvis figurarum*, Edinburgh, 1684, 4to. He saw very early the excellence of the Newtonian philosophy; and had the merit of being the first who introduced it into the schools by his public lectures at Edinburgh. \"He had (says Mr Whiston) already caused several of his scholars to keep acts, as we call them, upon several branches of the Newtonian philosophy; while at Cambridge, poor wretches, were ignominiously studying the fictitious hypotheses of the Carte.\"\n\nIn 1691, on the report of Dr Bernard's intention of resigning the Savilian professorship of astronomy at Oxford, David Gregory went to London; and being patronized by Sir Isaac Newton, and warmly befriended by Mr Flamsteed, the astronomer royal, he obtained the vacant professorship, for which Dr Halley was a competitor. This rivalry, however, instead of animosity, laid the foundation of friendship between these eminent men; and Halley soon after became the colleague of Gregory, by obtaining the professorship of geometry in the same university. Soon after his arrival in London, Mr Gregory had been elected a fellow of the royal society; and, previously to his election into the Savilian professorship, had the degree of doctor of physic conferred on him by the university of Oxford.\n\nIn 1693, he published in the Philosophical Transactions a solution of the Florentine problem *de Telescopio sveliformi quadribilis*; and he continued to communicate to the public, from time to time, many ingenious mathematical papers by the same channel. In 1695, he printed at Oxford *Catoptrice et Dioptrice Sphaerica Elementa*; a work which, as he informs us in his preface, contains the substance of some of his public lectures read, eleven years before, at Edinburgh. This valuable treatise was republished first with additions by Dr William Brown, with the recommendation of Mr Jones and Dr Deaguliers; and afterwards by the latter of these gentlemen, with an appendix containing an account of the Gregorian and Newtonian telescopes, together with Mr Hadley's tables for the construction of both those instruments. It is not unworthy of remark, that, in the end of this treatise, there is an observation which shows, that what is generally believed to be a discovery of a much later date, the construction of achromatic telescopes, which has been carried to great perfection by Mr Dollond and Mr Ramsden, had suggested itself to the mind of David Gregory, from the reflection on the admirable contrivance of nature in combining the different humours of the eye. The passage is as follows: \"Quod si ob difficulitates physicas in speculis idoneis torno elaborandis et poliendis, etiammum lentibus uti oporteat, fortassis media diversa densitate ad lentem objectivam componendam adhibere utile foret, ut a natura factum observamus in oculi fabrica, ubi cribrallinus humor (fere ejusdem cum vitro virtutis ad radius lucis refringendos) aquo et vitreo (aquea quoad refractionem habet abilim) conjungitur, ad imaginem quam distincte fieri poterit, a natura nihil frustra moliente, in oculi fundo depingendam.\" *Catopt. et Diopi. Sphaer. Elem. Oxon.* 1695, p. 98.\n\nIn 1702 our author published at Oxford, *Astronomiae Physicae*\n\n---\n\n(a) On obtaining the above professorship, he was succeeded in the mathematical chair at Edinburgh by his brother James, likewise an eminent mathematician; who held that office for 33 years, and retiring in 1725 was succeeded by the celebrated MacLaurin. A daughter of this professor James Gregory, a young lady of great beauty and accomplishments, was the victim of an unfortunate attachment, which furnished the subject of Mallet's well-known ballad of William and Margaret.\n\nAnother brother, Charles, was created professor of mathematics at St Andrew's by Queen Anne in 1707. This office he held with reputation and ability for 32 years; and, resigning in 1739, was succeeded by his son, who eminently inherited the talents of his family, and died in 1763.\nGregory, Physice et Geometrice Elementa; a work which is accounted his masterpiece. It is founded on the Newtonian doctrines, and was esteemed by Sir Isaac Newton himself as a most excellent explanation and defence of his philosophy. In the following year he gave to the world an edition in folio of the works of Euclid in Greek and Latin; in prosecution of a design of his predecessor Dr Bernard, of printing the works of all the ancient mathematicians. In this work, although it contains all the treatises attributed to Euclid, Dr Gregory has been careful to point out such as he found reason, from internal evidence, to believe to be the productions of some inferior geometrician. In prosecution of Dr Bernard's plan, Dr Gregory engaged, soon after, with his colleague Halley, in the publication of the Conics of Apollonius; but he had proceeded but a little way in this undertaking when he died, in the 49th year of his age, at Maidenhead in Berkshire, A.D. 1716.\n\nTo the genius and abilities of David Gregory, the most celebrated mathematicians of the age, Sir Isaac Newton, Dr Halley, and Dr Keill, have given ample testimonies. Indeed it appears that he enjoyed, in a high degree, the confidence and friendship of Sir Isaac Newton. This philosopher entrusted him with a manuscript copy of his Principia, for the purpose of making observations on that work. Of these observations there is a complete copy preserved in the library of the University of Edinburgh. They contain many valuable commentaries on the Principia, many interesting anecdotes, and various sublime mathematical difficulties. Some of the paragraphs are in the handwriting of Huygens, and they relate to the theory of light of this philosopher. The observations of Dr Gregory had come too late for the first edition of Newton's great work; but he availed himself of them in the second. Besides those works published in his lifetime, he left in manuscript, A Short Treatise of the Nature and Arithmetic of Logarithms, which is printed at the end of Dr Keill's translation of Commandine's Euclid; and a Treatise of Practical Geometry, which was afterwards translated, and published in 1745, by Mr MacLaurin.\n\nDr David Gregory married in 1695, Elizabeth the daughter of Mr Oliphant of Langtown in Scotland. By this lady he had four sons, of whom, the eldest, David, was appointed regius professor of modern history at Oxford by King George I., and died in 1767, in an advanced age, after enjoying for many years the dignity of dean of Christ-church in that university.\n\nGregory, Dr John, professor of medicine in the university of Edinburgh, was the son of Dr James Gregory professor of medicine in King's college Aberdeen, and grandson of James the inventor of the Gregorian telescope. His father was first married to Catharine Forbes, daughter of Sir John Forbes of Monymusk; by whom he had six children, most of whom died in infancy. He married afterwards Ann Chalmers, only daughter of the Rev. Mr George Chalmers principal of King's college, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. John, the youngest of the three, was born at Aberdeen, June 3, 1724. Losing his father when only in the 7th year of his age, the care of his education devolved on his grandfather Principal Chalmers, and on his elder brother Dr James Gregory, who, upon the resignation of their father a short time before his death, had been appointed to succeed him in the professorship of medicine in King's college. He likewise owed much in his infant years, and during the whole course of his studies, to the care and attention of his cousin, the celebrated Dr Reid, afterwards of the university of Glasgow.\n\nThe rudiments of our author's classical education he received at the grammar-school of Aberdeen; and under the eye of his grandfather, he completed, in King's college, his studies in the Latin and Greek languages, and in the sciences of ethics, mathematics, and natural philosophy. His master in philosophy and in mathematics was Mr Thomas Gordon, philosophy professor of King's college, who ably filled an academical chair for above half a century.\n\nIn 1742, Mr Gregory went to Edinburgh, where the school of medicine was then rising to that celebrity which has since so remarkably distinguished it. Here he attended the anatomical lectures of the elder Dr Monro, of Dr Sinclair on the theory of medicine, and of Dr Rutherford on the practice. He heard likewise the prelections of Dr Alston on the materia medica and botany, and of Dr Plumer on chemistry. The medical society of Edinburgh, instituted for the free discussion of all questions relative to medicine and philosophy, had begun to meet in 1737. Of this society we find Mr Gregory a member in 1742, at the time when Dr Mark Akenside, his fellow student and intimate companion, was a member of the same institution.\n\nIn the year 1745 our author went to Leyden, and attended the lectures of those celebrated professors Gaubius, Albins, and Van Royen. While at this place he had the honour of receiving from the King's college of Aberdeen, his alma mater, who regarded him as a favourite son, an unsolicited degree of doctor of medicine; and soon after, on his return thither from Holland, he was elected professor of philosophy in the same university. In this capacity he read lectures during the years 1747, 1748, and 1749, on mathematics, on experimental philosophy, and on moral philosophy. In the end of 1749, however, he chose to resign his professorship of philosophy, his views being turned chiefly to the practice of physic, with which he apprehended the duties of this professorship, occupying a great portion of his time, too much interfered. Previously, however, to his settling as a physician at Aberdeen, he went for a few months to the continent; a tour of which the chief motive was probably amusement, though, to a mind like his, certainly not without its profit in the enlargement of ideas, and an increased knowledge of mankind.\n\nSome time after his return to Scotland, Dr Gregory married in 1752, Elisabeth daughter of William Lord Forbes; a young lady who, to the exterior endowments of great beauty and engaging manners, joined a very superior understanding, and an uncommon share of wit. With her he received a handsome addition of fortune; and during the whole period of their union, which was but for the space of nine years, enjoyed the highest portion of domestic happiness. Of her character it is enough to say, that her husband, in that admired little work, A Father's Legacy to his Daughters, the last proof of his affection for them, declares, that \"while he endeavours to point out what they should be, he draws but a very faint and imperfect picture of what their mother was.\" The field of medical practice at Aberdeen being at that time in a great measure occupied\nGregory, occupied by his elder brother Dr James Gregory, and others of some note in their profession, our author determined to try his fortune in London. Thither accordingly he went in 1754; and being already known by reputation as a man of genius, he found an easy introduction to many persons of distinction both in the literary and polite world. The late George Lord Lyttelton was his friend and patron. An attachment, which was founded on a striking similarity of manners, of tastes, and of dispositions, grew up into a firm and permanent friendship; and to that nobleman, to whom Dr Gregory was wont to communicate all his literary productions, the world is indebted for the publication of the Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man, which made him first known as an author. Dr Gregory likewise enjoyed the friendship of the late Edward Montagu, Esq. and of his lady, the celebrated champion of the fame of Shakespeare, against the cavils and calumnies of Voltaire. At her assemblies, or conversations, the resort of taste and genius, our author had an opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance with many of the most distinguished literary characters of the present times.\n\nIn 1754 Dr Gregory was chosen fellow of the royal society of London; and daily advancing in the public esteem, it is not to be doubted, that, had he continued his residence in that metropolis, his professional talents would have found their reward in a very extensive practice. But the death of his brother, Dr James Gregory, in November 1755, occasioning a vacancy in the professorship of physic in King's college, Aberdeen, which he was solicited to fill, he returned to his native country in the beginning of the following year, and took upon him the duties of that office to which he had been elected in his absence.\n\nHere our author remained till the end of the year 1764, when urged by a very laudable ambition, and presuming on the reputation he had acquired as affording a reasonable prospect of success in a more extended field of practice, he changed his place of residence for Edinburgh. His friends in that metropolis had represented to him the situation of the college of medicine as favourable to his views of filling a professorial chair in that university; which accordingly he obtained in 1766, on the resignation of Dr Rutherford, professor of the practice of physic. In the same year he had the honour of being appointed first physician to his majesty for Scotland on the death of Dr Whytt.\n\nOn his first establishment in the university of Edinburgh, Dr Gregory gave lectures on the practice of physic during the years 1767, 1768, and 1769. Afterwards, by agreement with Dr Cullen, professor of the theory of physic, these two eminent men gave alternate courses of the theory and of the practice.—As a public speaker, Dr Gregory's manner was simple, natural, and animated. Without the graces of oratory, which the subject he had to treat in a great degree precluded, he expressed his ideas with uncommon perspicuity, and in a style happily attempted between the formality of studied composition and the ease of conversation. It was his custom to premeditate, for a short time before entering the college, the subject of his lecture, consulting those authors to whom he had occasion to refer, and marking in short notes the arrangement of his intended discourse; then fully master of his subject, and confident of his own powers, he trusted to his natural facility of expression to convey those opinions which he had maturely deliberated. The only lectures which he committed fully to writing, were those introductory discourses which he read at the beginning of his annual course, and which are published in these volumes under the title of Lectures on the Duties and Qualifications of a Physician. Of these, which were written with no view to publication, many copies were taken by his pupils, and some from the original manuscript, which he freely lent for their perusal. On hearing that a copy had been offered for sale to a bookseller, it became necessary to anticipate a fraudulent, and perhaps a mutilated publication, by authorising an impression from a corrected copy, of which he gave the profits to a favourite pupil. These lectures were first published in 1770, and afterwards in an enlarged and more perfect form in 1772.\n\nIn the same year, 1772, Dr Gregory published Elements of the Practice of Physic, for the use of Students: a work intended solely for his own pupils, and to be used by himself as a text-book to be commented upon in his course of lectures. In an advertisement prefixed to this work, he signified his intention of comprehending in it the whole series of diseases of which he treated in his lectures on the Practice of Physic; but this intention he did not live to accomplish, having brought down the work no further than to the end of the class of Febrile Diseases.—In his academical lectures, Dr Gregory never attempted to mislead the flatterer by flattering views of the perfection of the science; but was, on the contrary, anxious to point out its defects; wisely judging that a thorough sense of the imperfection of an art or science is the first step towards its improvement. In this view he was careful to expose the fallaciousness of the several theories and hypotheses which have had the most extensive currency, and perpetually inculcated the danger of systematizing with limited experience, or an imperfect knowledge of facts. Yet in the work last mentioned it will appear from the order in which he has treated of the several diseases, that he did not entirely neglect the systematic arrangements of other authors. These, however, he warned his pupils, that he had not adopted from any conviction of the rectitude of those theories to which they referred, but only as affording that degree of method, and regularity of plan, which is found to be the best help to the study of any science. Considering a rational theory of physic to be as yet a desideratum, it was his object to communicate to his pupils the greatest portion of practical knowledge, as the only basis on which such a theory could ever be reared. His method, in treating of the several diseases, was first to mention those symptoms which are understood among physicians to characterize or define a disease; proceeding from the general to the more particular series of symptoms and their occasional varieties; to point out accurately the diagnostic symptoms, or those by which one disease is essentially distinguished from others that resemble it, and to mark likewise the prognostics by which a physician is enabled to conjecture of the probable event of a disease, whether favourable or otherwise. He then proceeded to specify the various causes, predisposing, occasional, and proximate; accounting, as far as he thought could be done\nGregory, on just principles, for the appearance of the several symptoms; and, finally, he pointed out the general plan of cure, the particular remedies to be employed, and the cautions requisite in the administration of them. Thus desirous of establishing the science of medicine upon the solid foundation of practice and experience; and knowing that many things asserted as facts by medical writers have been assumed on a very careless observation, while confirming a favourite theory; and that, on the other hand, many real and important facts have, from the same spirit of system, been explained away and discredited; he constantly endeavoured, both by his precept and example, to inculcate to his pupils the necessity of extreme caution either in admitting or in denying medical facts, or what are commonly given as such. To the desire of enforcing this necessary caution is owing that multitude of queries respecting matters of fact, as well as matters of opinion, which occurs in the Elements of the Practice of Physic.\n\nDr Gregory, soon after the death of his wife, and, as he himself says, \"for the amusement of his solitary hours,\" employed himself in the composition of that admirable tract, entitled, A Father's Legacy to his Daughters; a work which, though certainly never intended by its author for the public eye, it would have been an unwarrantable diminution of his fame, and a capricious refusal of a general benefit to mankind, to have limited to the sole purpose for which it was originally designed. It was, therefore, with great propriety, published after the author's death by his eldest son. This work is a most amiable display of the piety and goodness of his heart, and his consummate knowledge of human nature and of the world. It manifests such solicitude for their welfare, as strongly recommends the advice which he gives. He speaks of the female sex in the most honourable terms, and labours to increase its estimation, whilst he plainly, yet gently, and tenderly, points out the errors into which young ladies are prone to fall.—It is particularly observable, in what high and honourable terms he speaks of the Holy Scriptures, of Christian worship, and faithful ministers; how warmly he recommends to his daughters the serious and devout worship of God in public and private. He dwells largely on that temper and behaviour, which were particularly suited to their education, rank, and circumstances; and recommends that gentleness, benevolence, and modesty, which adorn the character of the ladies, and do particular honour to their sex. His advices, with regard to love, courtship, and marriage, are peculiarly wise, and interesting to them. They show what careful observation he had made on female domestic conduct, and on the different effects of possessing or wanting the virtues and qualities which he recommends. There is something peculiarly curious, animated, and useful, in his directions to them, how to judge of, and manifest an honourable passion in, and towards the other sex, and in the very accurate and useful distinction which he makes between true and false delicacy. Nothing can be more striking and affecting, nothing more likely to give his paternal advices their desired effect, than the respectful and affectionate manner in which he mentions his lady their mother, and the irreparable loss which he and they sustained by her early death. In short, in this tract, the professor shines with peculiar lustre as a husband and father, and it is admirably adapted to promote domestic happiness.\n\nThese letters to his daughters were evidently written under the impression of an early death, which Dr Gregory had reason to apprehend from a constitution subject to the gout, which had begun to show itself at irregular intervals even from the 18th year of his age. His mother, from whom he inherited that disease, died suddenly in 1770, while sitting at table. Dr Gregory had prognosticated for himself a similar death; an event of which, among his friends, he often talked, but had no apprehension of the nearness of its approach. In the beginning of the year 1773, in conversation with his son Dr James Gregory, the latter remarking, that having for the three preceding years had no return of a fit, he might make his account with a pretty fever attack at that season; he received the observation with some degree of anger, as he felt himself then in his usual state of health. The prediction, however, was too true; for having gone to bed on the 9th of February 1773, with no apparent disorder, he was found dead in the morning. His death had been instantaneous, and probably in his sleep; for there was not the smallest discomposure of limb or of feature.—a perfect Euthanasia.\n\nDr Gregory, in person, was considerably above the middle size. His frame of body was compacted with symmetry, but not with elegance. His limbs were not active; he stooped somewhat in his gait; and his countenance, from a fulness of feature and a heaviness of eye, gave no external indication of superior power of mind or abilities. It was otherwise when engaged in conversation. His features then became animated, and his eye most expressive. He had a warmth of tone and of gesture which gave a pleasing interest to every thing which he uttered: But, united with this animation, there was in him a gentleness and simplicity of manner, which, with little attention to the exterior and regulated forms of politeness, was more engaging than the most finished address. His conversation flowed with ease; and, when in company with literary men, without affecting a display of knowledge, he was liberal of the stores of his mind. He possessed a large share of the social and benevolent affections, which, in the exercise of his profession, manifested themselves in many names, but important, attentions to those under his care; attentions which, proceeding in him from an extended principle of humanity, were not squared to the circumstances or rank of the patient, but ever bestowed most liberally where they were most requisite. In the care of his pupils, he was not satisfied with a faithful discharge of his public duties. To many of these strangers in the country, and far removed from all who had a natural interest in their concerns, it was matter of no small importance to enjoy the acquaintance and countenance of one so universally respected and esteemed.\n\nGRE-HOUND. See Canis, Mammalia Index.—Among a litter of greyhound puppies, the best are always those which are lightest. These will make the nimblest dogs as they grow up. The greyhound is best for open countries where there is little covert. In these places there will sometimes be a course after a hare of two or three miles or more, and both the dogs and the game...\ngame in fight all the while. It is generally supposed that the gre-hound bitch will beat the dog in running; but this seems to be an error; for the dog is both longer made, and considerably stronger, than the bitch of the same kind. In the breeding these dogs the bitch is principally to be regarded; for it is found by experience, that the best dog and a bad bitch will not get so good puppies as an indifferent dog with a good bitch. The dog and bitch should be as nearly as may be of the same age; and for the breeding of fine and perfect dogs, they should not be more than four years old. An old bitch may be used with a young dog, but the puppies of a young bitch and an old dog will never be good for anything.\n\nThe general food for a gre-hound ought to be chippings or raspings of bread, with soft bones and grittles; and those chippings ought always to be soaked in beef or mutton broth.\n\nThe proper exercise for a gre-hound is courting him three times a-week, and rewarding him with blood; which will animate him in the highest degree, and encourage him to prosecute his game. But the hare also should ever have fair play. She should have the law, as it is called; that is, have leave to run about twelve score yards before the dog is flipped at her, that he may have some difficulty in the course, and not pick up the game too easily. If he kills the hare, he must never be suffered to tear her; but the hounds must be taken from him, his mouth cleaned of the wool, and the liver and lights given him by way of encouragement. Then he is to be led home, and his feet washed with butter and beer, and about an hour after he is to be fed.\n\nWhen the dog is to be taken out to course, he should have nothing in the morning but a toast and butter, and then he is to be kennelled till taken out to the field. The kennelling these dogs is of great use, always giving them spirit and nimbleness when they are set loose: and the best way of managing a fine gre-hound is, never to let him stir out of the kennel, except at the times of feeding, walking, or courting.\n\nGRENADE, one of the Caribbee islands, lying in W. Long. 61° 49'. N. Lat. 12° 0. It is the last of the Windward Caribbees; and lies 30 leagues north of New Andalufia, on the continent. It is about 30 miles in length, and in some places 15 in breadth. The chief port, formerly called Louis, now St George's, stands on the west side of the island, in the middle of a large bay, with a sandy bottom. It is pretended that 1000 barks, from 300 to 400 tons, may ride secure from storms; and that 100 ships, of 1000 tons each, may be moored in the harbour. A large round bank, which is parted from it by a bank of sand, would contain a considerable number of ships, if the bank was cut through: but by reason of the large ships are obliged to pass within 80 paces of one of the mountains lying at the mouth of the harbour; the other mountain lying about half a mile distant. The island abounds with wild game and fish; it produces also very fine timber, but the cocoa tree is observed not to thrive here so well as in the other islands. A lake on a high mountain, about the middle of the island, supplies it with fresh-water streams. Several bays and harbours lie round the island, some of which might be fortified to great advantage; so that it is very convenient for shipping, not being subject to hurricanes. The soil is capable of producing tobacco, sugar, indigo, peas, and millet.\n\nIn 1638, M. Poincy, a Frenchman, attempted to make a settlement in Grenada; but was driven off by the Caribbeans, who resorted to this island in greater numbers than to the neighbouring ones, probably on account of the game with which it abounded. In 1650, Mons. Parquet, governor of Martinico, carried over from that island 200 men, furnished with presents to reconcile the savages to them; but with arms to subdue them, in case they should prove intractable. The savages are said to have been frightened into submission by the number of the Frenchmen: but, according to some French writers, the chief not only welcomed the new-comers; but, in consideration of some knives, hatchets, scissors, and other toys, yielded to Parquet the sovereignty of the island, referring to themselves their own habitations. The Abbé Raynal informs us, that these first French colonists, imagining they had purchased the island by these trifles, assumed the sovereignty, and soon acted as tyrants. The Caribs, unable to contend with them by force, took their usual method of murdering all those whom they found in a defenceless state. This produced a war; and the French settlers having received a reinforcement of 300 men from Martinico, forced the savages to retire to a mountain; from whence, after exhausting all their arrows, they rolled down great logs of wood on their enemies. Here they were joined by other savages from the neighbouring islands, and again attacked the French, but were defeated anew; and were at last driven to such desperation, that 40 of them, who had escaped from the slaughter, jumped from a precipice into the sea, where they all perished, rather than fall into the hands of their implacable enemies. From thence the rock was called le morne des sauteurs, or \"the hill of the leapers,\" which name it still retains. The French then destroyed the habitations and all the provisions of the savages; but fresh supplies of Caribbeans arriving, the war was renewed with great vigour, and great numbers of the French were killed. Upon this they resolved totally to exterminate the natives: and having accordingly attacked the savages unawares, they inhumanly put to death the women and children, as well as the men; burning all their boats and canoes, to cut off all communication between the few survivors and the neighbouring islands. Notwithstanding all these barbarous precautions, however, the Caribbeans proved the irreconcilable enemies of the French; and their frequent insurrections at last obliged Parquet to sell all his property in the island to the Count de Cerillac in 1657. The new proprietor, who purchased Parquet's property for 30,000 crowns, sent thither a person of brutal manners to govern the island. He behaved with such intolerable tyranny, that most of the colonists retired to Martinico; and the few who remained condemned him to death after a formal trial. In the whole court of justice that tried this miscreant, there was only one man (called Archangel) who could write. A farrier was the person who impeached; and he, instead of the signatures, sealed with a horse-hoe; and Archangel, who performed\nGrenada, formed the office of clerk, wrote round it these words in French, \"Mark of M. de la Brie, counsel for the court.\"\n\nIt was apprehended that the court of France would not ratify a sentence passed with such unusual formalities; and therefore most of the judges of the governor's crimes, and witnesses of his execution, disappeared. Only those remained whose obscurity screened them from the pursuit of the laws. By an estimate, taken in 1700, there were at Grenada no more than 251 white people, 53 free savages or mulattoes, and 525 slaves. The useful animals were reduced to 64 horses and 569 head of horned cattle. The whole culture consisted of three plantations of sugar and 52 of indigo.—The island had been sold in 1664 to the French West India company for 100,000 livres.\n\nThis unfavourable state of the affairs of Grenada was changed in 1714. The change was owing to the flourishing condition of Martinique. The richest of the ships from that island were sent to the Spanish coasts, and in their way touched at Grenada to take refreshments. The trading privateers, who undertook this navigation, taught the people of that island the value of their soil, which only required cultivation. Some traders furnished the inhabitants with slaves and utensils to erect sugar plantations. An open account was established between the two colonies. Grenada was clearing its debts gradually by its rich produce; and the balance was on the point of being closed, when the war in 1744 interrupted the communication between the two islands, and at the same time stopped the progress of the sugar-plantations. This loss was supplied by the culture of coffee, which was pursued during the hostilities with all the activity and eagerness that industry could inspire.—The peace of 1748 revived all the labours, and opened all the former sources of wealth. In 1753 the population of Grenada consisted of 1262 white people, 175 free negroes, and 11,991 slaves. The cattle amounted to 2298 horses or mules, 2456 head of horned cattle, 3278 sheep, 902 goats, and 331 hogs. The cultivation rose to 83 sugar plantations, 2,725,600 coffee trees, 1,503,300 cocoa-trees, and 800 cotton plants. The provisions consisted of 5,740,450 trenches of cattaila, 933,596 banana trees, and 143 squares of potatoes and yams. The colony made a rapid progress, in proportion to the excellence of its soil; but in the course of the last war but one the island was taken by the British. At this time one of the mountains at the side of St George's harbour was strongly fortified, and might have made a good defence, but surrendered without firing a gun; and by the treaty concluded in 1763 the island was ceded to Britain. On this cession, and the management of the colony after that event, the abbé Raynal has the following remarks.—\"This long train of evils [the ambition and mismanagement of his countrymen] has thrown Grenada into the hands of the English, who are in possession of this conquest by the treaty of 1763. But how long will they keep this colony? Or, will it never again be restored to France?—England has not made a fortunate beginning. In the first enthusiasm raised by an acquisition, of which the highest opinion had been previously formed, every one was eager to purchase estates there. They paid for much more than their real value. This caprice, by expelling old colonists who were ruined to the climate, has sent about 1,553,000l. out of the mother-country. This imprudence has been followed by another. The new proprietors, misled, no doubt, by national pride, have substituted new methods to those of their predecessors. They have attempted to alter the mode of living among their slaves. The negroes, who from their very ignorance are more attached to their customs than other men, have revolted. It hath been found necessary to send out troops, and to shed blood. The whole colony was filled with suspicions. The masters who had laid themselves under a necessity of using violent methods, were afraid of being burnt or massacred in their own plantations. The labours have declined, or been totally interrupted. Tranquillity has at length been restored. The number of slaves has been increased as far as 40,000, and the produce has been raised to the treble of what it was under the French government. The plantations will still be improved by the neighbourhood of a dozen of islands, called the Grenadines or Grenadilloes, that are dependent on the colony. They are from three to eight leagues in circumference. The air is wholesome. The ground, covered only with thin bushes, has not been screened from the sun. It exhales none of those noxious vapours which are fatal to the husbandman. Caracou, the only one of the Grenadines which the French have occupied, was at first frequented by turtle fishermen; who, in the leisure afforded them by so easy an occupation, employed themselves in clearing the ground. In process of time, their small number was increased by the accession of some of the inhabitants of Guadeloupe; who, finding that their plantations were destroyed by a particular sort of ants, removed to Caracou. The island flourished from the liberty that was enjoyed there. The inhabitants collected about 1200 slaves, by whose labours they made themselves a revenue of near 20,000l. a-year in cotton.—The other Grenadines do not afford a prospect of the same advantages, though the plantation of sugar is begun there. It has succeeded remarkably well at Becouya, the largest and most fertile of these islands, which is no more than two leagues distant from St Vincent.\"\n\nIn the year 1779 the conquest of this island was accomplished by D'Eftaigne, the French admiral, who had been prevented from attempting it before by his enterprise against St Vincent. Immediately after his conquest of St Lucia, however, being reinforced by a squadron under M. de la Motte, he set sail for Grenada with a fleet of 26 sail of the line and 12 frigates, having on board 10,000 land forces. Here he arrived on the second of July; and landed 3000 troops, chiefly Irish, being part of the brigade composed of natives of Ireland in the service of France. These were conducted by Count Dillon, who disposed them in such a manner as to surround the hill that overlooks and commands George's town, together with the fort and harbour. To oppose these, Lord M'Cartney, the governor, had only about 150 regulars, and 300 or 400 armed inhabitants; but though all resistance was evidently vain, he determined nevertheless to make an honourable and gallant defence. The preparations he made were such as induced D'Eftaigne himself to be present at the attack; and, even with his vast superiority of force, the first attack on the entrenchments proved unsuccessful.\nThe second continued two hours; when the garrison were obliged to yield to the immense disparity of numbers who assailed them, after having killed or wounded 300 of their antagonists. Having thus made themselves masters of the intrenchments on the hill, the French turned the cannon of them towards the fort which lay under it; on which the governor demanded a capitulation. The terms, however, were so extraordinary and unprecedented, that both the governor and inhabitants agreed in rejecting them; and determined rather to surrender without any conditions at all than upon those which appeared so extravagant. On this occasion D'Ettigny is said to have behaved in a very haughty and severe manner; indulging his soldiers also in the most unwarrantable liberties, and in which they would have proceeded much farther had they not been restrained by the Irish troops in the French service.\n\nIn the mean time Admiral Byron, who had been convoying the homeward-bound West India fleet, hastened to St Vincent, in hopes of recovering it; but being informed, by the way, that a descent had been made at Grenada, he changed his course, hoping that Lord McCartney would be able to hold out till his arrival. On the fifth of July he came in sight of the French fleet; and, without regarding D'Ettigny's superiority of five ships of the line and as many frigates, determined if possible to force him to a close engagement. The French commander, however, was not so confident of his own prowess as to run the risk of an encounter of this kind; and having already achieved his conquest, had no other view than to preserve it. His designs were facilitated by the good condition of his fleet; which being more lately come out of port than that of the British, sailed faster, so that he was thus enabled to keep at what distance he pleased. The engagement began about eight in the morning, when Admiral Barrington with his own and two other ships got up to the van of the enemy, which they attacked with the greatest spirit. As the other ships of his division, however, were not able to get up to his assistance, these three ships were necessarily obliged to encounter a vast superiority, and of consequence suffered exceedingly. The battle was carried on from beginning to end in the same unequal manner; nor were the British commanders, though they used their utmost efforts for this purpose, able to bring the French to a close engagement. Thus Captains Collingwood, Edwards, and Cornwallis, stood the fire of the whole French fleet for some time. Captain Fanshawe of the Monmouth, a 64 gun ship, threw himself singly in the way of the enemy's van; and Admiral Rowley and Captain Butchart fought at the same disadvantage: so that finding it impossible to continue the engagement with any probability of success, a general cessation of firing took place about noon. It recommenced in the same manner about two in the afternoon; and lasted, with different interruptions, till the evening. During this action some of the British ships had forced their way into St George's harbour, not imagining that the enemy were already in possession of the island. They were soon undeceived, however, by perceiving the French colours flying ashore, and the guns and batteries firing at them. This discovery put an end to the design which had brought on the engagement; and as it was now high time to think of providing for the safety of the British transports, which were in danger from the number of the enemy's frigates, the engagement was finally discontinued. During this action some of Admiral Byron's ships had suffered extremely. The Lion of 64 guns, Captain Cornwallis, was found incapable of rejoining the fleet which were plowing to windward; and was therefore obliged to bear away alone before the wind. Two other ships lay far astern in a very distressed situation; but no attempt was made to capture them, nor did the French admiral show the least inclination to renew the engagement.\n\nGrenada was restored to Great Britain by the treaty of peace of 1783—George's town, or St George's, is the residence of the governor.\n\nWhen the levelling spirit of the French revolution threatened to banish all rational liberty and subordination from the face of the earth, the ill-fated island of Grenada did not escape the contagion. The slaves in this island were early tinctured with the love and admiration of those principles which subverted the monarchy of France. They were of consequence ready to revolt at the instigations of republican emissaries, who in 1795 effected a landing from the island of Guadeloupe in considerable numbers. Yet many of the slaves hesitated at first to take an active part in this unnatural rebellion against the British government; but their perseverance was at length shaken by the alluring temptations which were held out to them, of participating in the property of their plundered masters, and the flattering promises of total emancipation.\n\nIt is astonishing, as it seems repugnant to every feeling of human nature with which we are acquainted, that such of the slaves, both male and female, as had experienced the most humane treatment, and enjoyed the greatest share of their masters confidence, were the most active and cruel in this horrible insurrection. This seems to be a melancholy proof of an affection often made by those who are inimical to the abolition of the slave-trade, that the most humane and benevolent treatment can make no impression on their native ferocity.\n\nAs the French troops had been too successful in their attack upon Guadeloupe, the disaffected negroes in Grenada who spoke the French language, as well as numbers of white people who were charmed with the extravagant doctrine of liberty and equality, were encouraged to project and execute a revolt from the British government, every step of which they marked with plunder and with blood. Having effected a landing at Grenville or La Baye, and Charlotte town, on different sides of the island, the insurgents, to the number of 100, surrounded the former place, and about one o'clock in the morning (March 6, 1795) plundered the dwelling and store houses, and dragging the innocent, the affrighted inhabitants into the streets, set them up as marks to be shot at. When they fell before the discharge of their musketry, the inhuman banditti mangled their bodies with cutlasses in the most shocking manner. At this time there were 14 English inhabitants in the town, only three of whom escaped the infatiable vengeance of those pretended lovers of freedom! Some escaped by swimming to the vessels which were then lying in the roads, while others captured by the insurgents, were murdered on their way to the camp of the rebel\nGRENADES' rebel chief Fedon, because they could not march so quickly as desired.\n\nGrenadines committed at this place, and the plunder and devastation which marked their steps in other parts of the island, are shocking to humanity; and it is too notorious that the insurgents were instigated to the whole by the restless emissaries of the French republic. The insurrection was not finally suppressed till June 1796.\n\nGRENADINES, or GRENADILLOS. See the preceding article.—In these islands, fresh water is found only in one place. A small spring has been discovered in the principal island Caricou, by digging; but being of great value, it is kept locked by the proprietor. The capital of that island is called Hilborough, in which there is a small church.\n\nGRENAILLE, a name given by the French writers to a preparation of copper, which the Chinese use as a red colour in some of their finest china, particularly for that colour which is called oil-red or red in oil. The china-ware coloured with this is very dear. The manner in which they procure the preparation is thus: they have in China no such thing as silver-coined money, but they use in commerce bars or muffs of silver; these they pay and receive in large bargains; and among a nation so full of fraud as the Chinese, it is no wonder that these are too often adulterated with too great an alloy of copper. They pass, however, in this state, in the common payments. There are some occasions, however, such as the paying the taxes and contributions, on which they must have their silver pure and fine: on this occasion they have recourse to certain people, whose sole business it is to refine the silver, and separate it from the copper and the lead it contains. This they do in furnaces made for the purpose, and with very convenient vessels. While the copper is in fusion, they take a small broth, and dip the end of it into water; then striking the handle of the brush, they sprinkle the water by degrees upon the melted copper; a sort of pellicle forms itself by this means on the surface of the matter, which they take off while hot with pincers of iron, and immediately throwing it into a large vessel of cold water, it forms that red powder which is called the grenaille; they repeat the operation every time they in this manner separate the copper; and this furnishes them with as much of the grenaille as they have occasion for in their china works.\n\nGRENOBLE, a large, populous, and ancient town of France, in the department of Isère, with a bishop's see. It contains a great number of handsome structures, particularly the churches and convents. The leather and gloves that are made here are highly esteemed.

He was, as his father had been before him, appointed king's agent at Antwerp, for taking up money of the merchants; and in 1531 he removed to that city with his family. This employment was suspended on the accession of Queen Mary; but on proper representations, was restored to him again. Queen Elizabeth conferred the honour of knighthood upon him, and made him her agent in foreign parts. It was at this time he thought proper to provide himself with a mansion-house in the city, suitable to his station and dignity; with which intention he built a large house on the west side of Bishopsgate-street, afterwards known by the name of Gresham-college. His father had proposed building a house or exchange for the merchants to meet in, instead of walking in the open street; but this design remained for the son to accomplish. Sir Thomas went beyond his father: he offered, if the citizens would provide a proper piece of ground, to build a house at his own expense; which, being accepted, he fulfilled his promise after the plan of the exchange at Antwerp. When the new edifice was opened, the queen (Jan. 29, 1570) came and dined with the founder; and caused a herald with a trumpet to proclaim it by the name of the Royal Exchange. In pursuance also of a promise to endow a college for the profession of the seven liberal sciences, he made a testamentary disposition of his house in London for that purpose; leaving one moiety of the royal exchange to the corporation of London, and the other to the mercers company, for the salaries of seven lecturers in divinity, law, physic, astronomy, geometry, music, and rhetoric, at £50 each per annum. He left several other considerable benefactions, and died in 1579. As to the college, it was afterwards pulled down in consequence of an application to parliament from the city, and the excise-office erected in its place. The lectures are read, or rather hurried through, in a chamber over the Royal Exchange.—Those who have drawn Sir Thomas's character observe, that he had the happiness of a mind every way suited to his fortune; generous and benign; ready to perform any good actions, and encourage them in others. He was a great friend and patron of our celebrated martyrologist John Fox. He was well acquainted with the ancient and several modern languages; he had a very comprehensive knowledge of all affairs relating to commerce, whether foreign or domestic; and his success was not less, being in his time esteemed the highest commoner in England. He transacted Queen Elizabeth's mercantile affairs so constantly, that he was called the royal merchant; and his house was sometimes appointed for the reception of foreign princes upon their first arrival at London.\n\nGREUSSEN, a town of Upper Saxony, in the county of Schwartzburg, 16 miles north of Erfurt, and 18 east of Mühlhausen. Long. 10° 45' east, Lat. 51° 6' north.\n\nGREVILLE, FULKE, Lord Brook, of Beauchamp's Court in Warwickshire, a poet and miscellaneous writer, was born in the year 1554, and descended from the noble families of Beauchamps of Powick and Willoughby de Brook. In company with his cousin Sir Philip Sidney, he began his education at a school in Shrewsbury; thence he went to Oxford, where he remained for some time a gentleman commoner, and then removed to Trinity-College in Cambridge. Having left the university, he visited foreign courts, and thus added to his knowledge of the ancient languages a perfect knowledge of the modern. On his return to England he was introduced to Queen Elizabeth by\nhis uncle Robert Greville, at that time in her majesty's service; and by means of Sir Henry Sidney, lord president of Wales, was nominated to some lucrative employments in that principality.\n\nIn the year 1581, when the French commissioners who came to treat about the queen's marriage with the duke of Anjou were sumptuously entertained with tilts and tournaments, Mr Greville, who was one of the challengers, so signalized himself, as to \"win the reputation of a most valiant knight.\" He continued a constant attendant at court, and a favourite with the queen to the end of her reign; during which he obtained the office of treasurer of marine causes, also a grant of the manor of Wedgnoeck, and likewise the honour of knighthood. In this reign he was several times elected member for the county of Warwick; and from the journals of the house seems to have been a man of business, as his name frequently appears in committees.\n\nOn the accession of King James I. he was installed knight of the Bath; and soon after obtained a grant of the ruinous castles of Warwick, which he repaired at a considerable expense, and where he probably resided during the former part of this reign: but in the year 1614, the twelfth of James I. he was made under-treasurer, and chancellor of the exchequer, one of the privy council, and gentleman of the bed-chamber; and in 1620, was raised to the dignity of a baron by the title of Lord Brook of Beauchamp's Court. He was also privy-councillor to King Charles I. in the beginning of whose reign he founded a history-lecture in Cambridge.\n\nHaving thus attained the age of 74, through a life of continued prosperity, universally admired as a gentleman and a scholar, he fell by the hand of an assassin, one of his own domestics, who immediately stabbed himself with the same weapon with which he had murdered his master. This fellow's name was Haywood; and the cause is said to have been a severe reprimand for his presumption in upbraiding his master for not providing for him after his death. It seems he had been witness to Lord Brook's will, and knew the contents. Some say he stabbed him with a knife in the back, others with a sword. This affair happened at Brook-house in Holborne.—Lord Brook was buried with great pomp in St Mary's church at Warwick, in his own vault, over which he had erected a monument of black and white marble, ordering at his death the following inscription to be engraved upon the tomb: \"Fulke Greville, servant to Queen Elizabeth, counsellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney. Trophaeum Peccati.\" He wrote several works both in verse and prose; among which are, 1. Two tragedies, Alaham and Mustapha. 2. A Treatise of Human Learning, &c. in verse, folio. 3. The Life of Sir Philip Sidney. 4. An Inquisition upon Fame and Honour, in 86 stanzas. 6. Caecilia, a collection of 109 songs. 7. His Remains, consisting of political and philosophical poems.\n\nGREVIUS. See Graevius.\n\nGREW, Nehemiah, a learned English writer, in the 17th century, had a considerable practice as a physician in London, and succeeded Mr Oldenburg in the office of secretary to the royal society. In this capacity, pursuant to an order of council, he drew up a catalogue of the natural and artificial rarities belonging to the society, under the title of Museum Regalis Societatis, &c. 1681. He also wrote, besides several pieces in the Philosophical Transactions, 1. The Comparative Anatomy of the Stomach and Guts, folio. 2. The Anatomy of Plants, folio. 3. Tractatus de falsis Cathartici naturae usu. 4. Cosmologia Sacra, or a Discourse of the Universe as it is the Creature and Kingdom of God, folio.

See Botany Index.\n\nGREY, or Gray colour. See Gray.\n\nGREY, Lady Jane, a most illustrious and unfortunate lady, descended of the blood-royal of England by both parents, was the eldest daughter of Henry Grey marquis of Dorset, and Frances the daughter of Charles Brandon Lord Suffolk, by Mary the dowager of Louis XII. king of France, who was the youngest daughter of Henry VII. king of England. She was born in the year 1537, at Broadgate, her father's seat in Leicestershire. She discovered an early propensity to all kinds of good literature; and having a fine genius, improved under the tuition of Mr Elmer, she made a most surprising progress in the languages, arts, and sciences. She understood perfectly both kinds of philosophy, and could express herself very properly at least in the Latin and Greek tongues; and we are informed by Sir Thomas Chaloner (in Strype's Memorials, vol. iii. p. 93.), that she was well versed in Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, French, and Italian; \"and (he adds) she played well on instrumental music, wrote curious hand, and was excellent at the needle.\" Chaloner also tells us, that she accompanied her musical instrument with a voice exquisitely sweet in itself, afflited by all the graces that art could bestow.\n\nIn the year 1553, the dukes of Suffolk and Northumberland, who were now, after the fall of Somerset, arrived at the height of power, began, on the decline of the king's health, to think how to prevent that reverse of fortune which, as things then stood, they foretold must happen upon Edward's death. To obtain this end, no other remedy was judged sufficient but a change in the succession of the crown, and transferring it into their own families, by rendering Lady Jane queen. Those most excellent and amiable qualities which had rendered her dear to all who had the happiness to know her, joined to her near affinity to the king, subjected her to become the chief tool of an ambition to notoriously not her own. Upon this very account she was married to Lord Guilford Dudley, fourth son of the duke of Northumberland, without discovering to her the real design of the match; which was celebrated with great pomp in the latter end of May, so much to the king's satisfaction, that he contributed bounteously to the expense of it from the royal wardrobe. The young king Edward VI. died in July following; and our fair scholar, with infinite reluctance, overpowered by the solicitations of her ambitious friends, allowed herself to be proclaimed queen of England, on the strength of a deed of settlement extorted from that prince by her father-in-law the duke of Northumberland, which set aside the succession of Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and Mary queen.\nGrey queen of Scots. Her regal pageantry continued but a few days. Queen Mary's undoubted right prevailed; and the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey and her husband were committed to the Tower, and on the 13th of November arraigned and found guilty of high treason. On the 12th of February following they were both beheaded on Tower-hill. Her magnanimity in this dreadful catastrophe was astonishing. Immediately before her execution, she addressed herself to the weeping multitude with amazing composure and coherence: she acknowledged the justice of the law, and died in charity with that wretched world which she had so much reason to execrate. Thus did the pious Mary begin her reign with the murder of an innocent young creature of 18; who for simplicity of manners, purity of heart, and extensive learning, was hardly ever equalled in any age or country. But, alas! Jane was an obstinate heretic.—A few days before her execution, Fleckenham, the queen's chaplain, with a pious intention to rescue her poor soul from eternal misery, paid her frequent visits in the Tower, and used every argument in his power to convert her to the Popish religion; but he found her so much his superior in argument, that he gave up the contest: resigning her body to the block, and her soul to the devil.\n\nHer writings are, 1. Four Latin Epistles; three to Bullenger, and one to her sister Lady Catherine. The last was written the night before her execution, in a blank leaf of a Greek Testament. Printed in a book entitled Epistolae Helvetiae Reformatoribus, vel ad eos scriptae, &c. Tiguri, 1742, 8vo. 2. Her Conference with Fleckenham. (Ballard). 4. A letter to Dr Harding, her father's chaplain. Printed in the Phoenix, vol. ii. p. 28. 4. A prayer for her own use during her confinement. In Fox's acts and monuments. 5. Four Latin verses; written in prison with a pin. They are as follows:\n\nNon aliena putes, homini quaestione possunt:\nSors hodierna mihi, tunc erit illa tibi.\n\nDeo juvante, nil nocet livor malus:\nEt non juvante, nil juvat labor gravis.\n\nPost tenebras spero lucem.\n\n6. Her Speech on the Scaffold. (Ballard). It began thus: \"My Lords, and you good Christian people who come to see me die; I am under a law, and by that law, as a never-erring judge, I am condemned to die: not for any thing I have offended the queen's majesty; for I will wash my hands guiltless thereof, and deliver to my God a foul as pure from such trespasses as innocence from injustice; but only for that I confessed to the thing I was enforced unto, constraint making the law believe I did that which I never underflood;\" &c.\n\n—Hollinshed, Sir Richard Baker, Bale, and Fox, tell us that she wrote several other things, but do not mention where they are to be found.\n\nGREY-Hound.

The influence of this passion on the body is very great. Its effects resemble in several instances those of fear, with, however, some variations, owing perhaps to its being in general of longer duration. Grief diminishes the bodily strength in general, and particularly the force of the heart and circulation; as appears by the frequent sighs and deep respirations which attend it, which seem to be necessary exertions, in order to promote the passage of the blood through the lungs. It diminishes perspiration, obstructs the menstrual discharge, produces paleness of the skin, and oedematous complaints, and chirrhus of the glandular parts. It aggravates the feverly, and the malignity of putrid and contagious distempers, and renders people more apt to receive the infection of them. When it comes on suddenly, and in a great degree, it causes a palpitation of the heart, and renders the pulse irregular. Blindness, gangrene, and sudden death, have followed the excess of this sensation. Its effects of changing the colour of the hair are well known. Opiates, if not given in large doses, are good cordials in this case.\n\nGRIEFFENHAKEN, a town of Prussian Pomerania, in the duchy of Stein, seated on the Oder, opposite to Gartz. E. Long. 14. 42. N.

She was an excellent Greek and Latin scholar; and understood history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics. She proved her skill in Latin by her dedication of the Dublin edition of Tacitus to Lord Carteret, and by that of Terence to his son; to whom she also addressed a Greek epigram. She wrote many elegant English poems, several of which were inserted by Mrs Barber among her own. When Lord Carteret was lord lieutenant of Ireland, he obtained a patent for Mr Grierson to be the king's printer; and to reward the uncommon merit of his wife, caused her life to be included in it.\n\nGRIESEWALDE, a town of Upper Saxony, 24 miles south-east of Stralsund.

They represented it with four legs, wings, and a beak; the upper part representing an eagle, and the lower a lion: they supposed it to watch over gold mines, hidden treasures, &c. The animal was consecrated to the sun; and the ancient painters represented the chariot of the sun as drawn by griffons. M. Spanheim observes the same of those of Jupiter and Nemesis.\n\nThe griffin in Scripture is that species of the eagle called in Latin gryphus, the \"oprey;\" and ἀγριος, of the verb ἀγριέω, πάρα, \"to break.\"\n\nThe griffin is frequently seen on ancient medals; and is still borne in coat-armour. Guillim blazons it rampant; alleging, that any very fierce animal may be so blazoned as well as the lion.

See Botany Index.\n\nGRIMALDI, FRANCISCO, an eminent painter, generally known by the appellation of Bolognese, was born at Bologna in 1666, where he became a disciple of Annibal Caracci, and proved an honour to that illustrious matter. From the school of Annibal he went to complete his studies at Rome, and improved himself daily, by copying the works of those artists in which he observed the greatest excellence, until his superior talents recommended him to the favour of Innocent X., who afforded him immediate opportunities of exerting his genius in the gallery of his palace at Monte Cavallo, and also in the Vatican. The merit of his performances very soon engaged the attention and applause of the public, and increased the number of his admirers and friends; among whom were the prince Pamphilio, and many of the principal nobility of Rome. His reputation reached Cardinal Mazarine at Paris, who sent for him, settled a large pension on him, and employed him for three years in embellishing his palace and the Louvre, by the order of Louis XIII. The troubles of the state, and the clamours raised against the cardinal, whose party he warmly espoused, put him in much danger, that his friends advised him to retire among the Jesuits. He did so, and was of use to them; for he painted them a decoration for the exposition of the sacrament during the holy days, according to the custom of Rome. This piece was mightily relished at Paris: the king honoured it with two visits, and commanded him to paint such another for his chapel at the Louvre. Grimaldi after that returned to Italy; and at his arrival at Rome found his great patron Innocent X. dead: but his two successors Alexander VII. and Clement IX. honoured him equally with their friendship, and found him variety of employment. Grimaldi was amiable in his manners, as well as skilful in his profession: he was generous without profusion, respectful to the great without meanness, and charitable to the poor. The following instance of his benevolence may serve to characterise the man. A Sicilian gentleman, who had retired from Messina with his daughter during the troubles of that country, was reduced to the misery of wanting bread. As he lived over-against him, Grimaldi was soon informed of it; and in the dusk of the evening, knocking at the Sicilian's door, without making himself known, tossed in money and retired. The thing happening more than once, raised the Sicilian's curiosity to know his benefactor; who finding him out, by hiding himself behind the door, fell down on his knees to thank the hand that had relieved him. Grimaldi remained confused, offered him his house, and continued his friend till his death. He died of a dropy at Rome in 1680, and left a considerable fortune among six children. The genius of Grimaldi directed him chiefly to landscape, which he executed most happily. His colouring is strong; his touch light and delicate; his situations are uncommonly pleasing; and the leafing of his trees is admirable. Sometimes, indeed, his colouring appears rather too green: but those landscapes, which he painted in the manner of Caracci, may serve as models for all those who admire the style of that school; and he designed his figures in an elegant taste. The pictures of this matter are very rare, especially those of his best time; and whenever they are to be purchased, they afford large prices. Of his children above-mentioned, the youngest, named Alexander, proved a good painter, in the same style and taste with his father, though very far inferior to him: some of the pictures of Alexander, however, are either artfully, or judiciously, ascribed to Francesco.\n\nGRIMBERGEN, a town of Austrian Brabant, with an abbey and a castle, six miles north of Brussels.

See Pulverisation and Levigation.\n\nThe painters colours are ground on a marble or porphyry, either with oil or gum-water.\n\nGrinding is also used for rubbing or wearing off the irregular parts of the surface of a body, and reducing it to the defined figure, whether that be flat, concave, or the like.\n\nThe grinding and polishing of glass is a considerable art; for which see Glass Grinding. For the grinding of optical glasses, see Optics, the Mechanical Part.\n\nGrinding, in cutlery, is an operation universally understood, by which edge-tools are sharpened. According to the usual practice, this operation is attended with considerable inconvenience, occasioned by the extraction of heat from friction. The steel very soon becomes ignited when the friction is performed on a dry stone; and even when immersed in water, the operation must be slow, to prevent the water from being thrown off by the centrifugal force; and if the water is poured on the stone from above by means of a cock, the quantity will be too small to preserve a sufficiently low temperature. But let the quantity of water be ever so great, if the instrument to be sharpened has not its point or edge so held as to meet the stream, it will almost inevitably be made softer.\n\nTo remedy these defects in the common mode of grinding, Mr Nicholson made an experiment with a grindstone.\nGrinding, grindstone from Newcastle of a fine grit, 10 inches in diameter, with a block of mahogany to be employed with emery on the face of it. The grindstone and block were fixed on an axis, to be applied occasionally between the centres of a strong lathe. Both were cylindrical, and of the same diameter; the wood was grooved in opposite directions, in which the emery might be lodged. The face of the stone was left smooth, with a trough under it to hold the water. The cylinder of wood was faced with emery and oil, and the stone was used with water. A file was the instrument ground, and it was propelled to efface all the teeth. The mechanism of the lathe produced the rotation, by which the grinding apparatus made five revolutions in a second. The operation of the stone was slow, and the workman soon found inconvenience from the water in the trough being soon exhausted; but the emery cylinder cut rather faster. The friction operated by quick changes on the whole surface of the file, yet it soon became too hot to be held conveniently by the uncovered hand; and even when it was held with a cloth, such was the rapid increase of heat as to decompose the oil, which emitted an empyreumatic odour. When the stone became dry, the file was tried on the face of it, which soon became blue, and then nearly red-hot. After this both cylinders were covered with tallow, and emery was sprinkled upon the wooden cylinder, when the same instrument was held to the stone in rapid motion. The friction at first was scarcely apparent, but the prelude of the tool soon fused the tallow, and the stone cut very fast. When the tool after some time began to be a little heated, it was removed to a new zone of the cylinder, by which means the temperature was diminished. Similar effects accompanied the use of the wooden cylinder.\n\nWhen oil was used upon the cylinder of wood, the heat occasioned by the friction raised the temperature of the instrument and of the oil in a state of fluidity; but when tallow instead of oil was employed, most of the heat was used in fusing that substance. The increased capacity of the melted tallow absorbed this heat, which became latent, and did not raise the temperature; and when the tallow already melted began to grow hot, as well as the tool, the employing another zone of congealed tallow reduced the temperature.\n\nThis discovery may yet be of considerable importance, for which we are indebted to the ingenuity of the learned editor of the Journal which bears his name, a performance which is much esteemed upon the continent as well as at home, by every man of literature and science.\n\nGRINSTED, East and West; two towns near Salisbury in Wiltshire.\n\nGrinsted, Eo/, a town 29 miles from London, seated on a hill near the borders of Surrey, near Ashdown forest. It has a handsome church, which was rebuilt after being burnt down 1683. On November 12, 1785, the beautiful tower having lately fallen to decay, fell down, and part lighting on the church very considerably damaged it. An hospital in the reign of King James I, for 31 poor people of this town, was built and endowed with 330l. a-year. It is a borough by prescription, governed by a bailiff and his brethren; has sent burgesses to parliament ever since the first of Edward II, who are elected by about 35 burgage-holders; had a charter for a monthly market from Henry VII, and is generally the place for the affizes. The returning officer here is the bailiff, who is chosen by a jury of burgage-holders. Its market is on Thursday; and its fairs, which are well frequented, are July 13 and December 11; which last is a great one for Welsh runts, that are bought up here by the Kentish and Suffolk farmers, and for fat hogs and other cattle.\n\nGrinsted, We/, in Sussex, a town above 10 miles to the south-west of East-Grinstead.\n\nGRIPES, in Medicine, a sort of choleric or painful disorder of the lower belly, occasioned by irritating matters, or by wind pent up in the intestines.

Lat. 54. 12.\n\nGRISGRIS, a superstition greatly in vogue among the negroes in the interior parts of Africa. The grigris, according to Le Maire, are certain Arabic characters mixed with magical figures drawn by the marabouts or priests upon paper. Labat affirms, that they are nothing else than scraps of the Koran in Arabic; but this is denied by Barbot, who brought over one of these grigris to Europe, and showed it to a number of persons deeply skilled in oriental learning. None of these could find the least trace of any character they understood. Yet, after all, this might be owing to the badness of the handwriting; and the words are probably of the Mandingo language, though the characters are an attempt to imitate the Arabic. The poorest negro never goes to war without his grigris, as a charm against wounds; and if it proves ineffectual, the priest transfers the blame on the immorality of his conduct. These priests invent grigris against all kinds of dangers, and in favour of all desires and appetites; by virtue of which the petitioners may obtain or avoid whatever they like or dislike. They defend them from storms, enemies, diseases, pains, and misfortunes; and preserve health, long life, wealth, honour, and merit, according to the marabouts. No clergy in the world are more honoured and revered by the people than these impostors are by the negroes; nor are any people in the world more impoverished by their priests than these negroes are, a grigris being frequently sold at three slaves and four or five oxen. The grigris intended for the head is made in the form of a cross, reaching from the forehead to the neck behind, and from ear to ear; nor are the arms and shoulders neglected. Sometimes they are planted in their bonnets in the form of horns; at other times, they are made like serpents, lizards, or some other animals, cut out of a kind of pasteboard, &c. There are not wanting Europeans, and otherwise intelligent seamen and merchants, who are in some degree infected with this weakness of the country, and believe that the negro sorcerers have an actual communication with the devil, and that they are filled with the malignant influence of that evil spirit, when they see them distort their features and muscles, make horrid grimaces, and at last imitate all the appearance of epileptics.\n\nGRISONS, a people situated among the Alps, and allies of the Swiss. Their country is bounded on the\nnorth by the counties of Sargans and Bludenz, the canton of Glaris, and the principality of Lichtenstein; on the south by the canton's Italian bailiwics, the county of Chavanne, and the Valteline; on the east by the territories of Venice and Milan; and on the west by some of the Italian bailiwics, and the canton of Uri. It is divided into three leagues, viz. the Grifon or gray league, the league of the house of God, and that of the ten jurisdictions; which unite and form one republic. The two first lie towards the south, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above 70 miles, and the breadth about 60. The inhabitants are said to have had the name of Grifons from the gray coats they wore in former times. This country, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous; but the mountains yield good pasture for cattle, sheep, and goats, with some rye and barley: in the valleys there is plenty of grain, pulse, fruits, and wine. This country also abounds with hogs and wild-fowl; but there is a scarcity of fish and salt, and their horses are mostly purchased of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are also several lakes, most of which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Grifons is either a corrupt Italian or the German. Each of the leagues is subdivided into several lesser communities, which are so many democracies; every male above 16 having a share in the government of the community, and a vote in the election of magistrates. Deputies from the several communities constitute the general diet of the Grifon leagues, which meets annually, and alternately at the capital of each league; but they can conclude nothing without the consent of their constituents. This country was anciently a part of Rhetia. After the extinction of the Roman empire in the west, it was some time subject to its own dukes, or those of Swabia. Then the bishop of Coire, and other petty princes, dependent on the emperors of Germany, became masters of great part of it: at last, by the extinction of some, purchase, voluntary grants, and force, it got rid of all its lords, and erected itself into three distinct republics, each of which, as we observed already, is subdivided into a certain number of communities, which are a sort of republics, exercising every branch of sovereignty, except that of making peace or war, sending embassies, concluding alliances, and enacting laws relating to the whole country, which belong to the provincial diets of the several leagues. The communities may be compared to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the several leagues to the provincial states. The particular diets are composed of a deputy from each community; and both in them and the communities every thing is determined by a majority of votes. In the communities, every male above 16 has a vote. Besides the annual provincial diets for choosing the chiefs and other officers, and deliberating on the affairs of the respective leagues, there are general diets for what concerns all the three leagues or whole body. In both these, the representatives can do nothing of themselves, but are tied down to the instructions of their principals. There is a general seal for all the three leagues; and each particular league has a separate seal. Besides the stated times of meeting, extraordinary diets are sometimes summoned, when either the domestic affairs of the state or any foreign minister require it. In the general diets, the Grey League has 23 votes; that of Grifons, the House of God, 23; and that of the Ten Jurisdictions, 15. These leagues, at different times, have entered into close alliances with the neighbouring cantons and their associates. The bailiwics belonging in common to the three leagues are those of the Valteline, Chievane, Bormio, Meyenfeld, Malans, and Jenins; the officers of which are nominated successively by the several communities every two years. The yearly revenues arising to the Grifons from their bailiwics is said to amount to about 13,500 florins. The public revenues altogether are but small, though there are many private persons in the country that are rich. However, in case of any extraordinary emergency, they tax themselves in proportion to the necessity of the service and the people's abilities. They have no regular troops, but a well-disciplined militia; and upon occasion, it is said, can bring a body of 30,000 fighting men into the field; but their chief security arises from the narrow passes and high mountains by which they are surrounded.\n\nOf the jurisprudence, religion, &c. of the Grifons, the following account is given by Mr. Cox in his travels in Switzerland. Throughout the three leagues the Roman law prevails, modified by the municipal customs. The courts of justice in each community are composed of the chief magistrate, who presides, and a certain number of jurymen, chosen by the people: they have no regular salaries, but receive for their attendance, a small sum, arising in some communities from the expenses of the process, which are defrayed by the criminals; in others from a share of the fines. They enjoy the power of pardoning or diminishing the penalty, and of receiving a composition in money. This mode of proceeding supposes what is as absurd in theory as it is contrary to experience, that judges will incline to mercy when it is their interest to convict; or will impartially inflict punishment, even when injurious to their own private advantage.—The prisoners are examined in private; frequently tortured for the purpose of forcing confession, when the judges either divide the fines, or remit the punishment for a composition. In some districts a criminal trial is a kind of festival to the judges, for whom a good repast is provided at the expense of the prisoner if convicted; and thus the following allusion, in Garth's Dispensary, applied with more wit than truth to our courts of justice, is literally fulfilled:\n\n\"And wretches hang, that jurymen may dine.\"\n\nCapital punishments, however, are extremely rare; a circumstance arising not from a want of severity in the penal statutes, or from a propensity to mercy in the judges: but because the latter draw more advantages from fining than executing an offender. In a word, to use the expression of Burnet, which is as true at present as it was in his time, \"Many crimes go unpunished, if the persons who commit them have either great credit or much money.\" It is remarkable, that torture is more frequently applied, and for smaller delinquencies, in these independent republics, than in the subject provinces. The infliction of it depends entirely upon the arbitrary will of the judges; a majority of whom may order it for an offence which is not capital, nor even punishable by corporal penalties. Thus\nit is not uncommon, in those communities where fines are divided among the judges, to torture women of loose conduct, for the purpose of compelling them to confess with whom they have been connected; for as such offences are punishable by fines, the more persons are convicted, the larger share of money is distributed among the judges for the trouble of their attendance.\n\nEven in the districts where the fines are paid to the community, torture is often no less wantonly inflicted, because when the prisoner is not found guilty, the expenses of the process fall upon the public, and the judges receive little emolument. Even in the civil courts most causes are decided by bribing the judges; and appeals in those communities, wherein they are admitted, scarcely serve any other end than to enlarge the sphere of corruption. Coire and a few other places are excepted from this general reflection.\n\nThe religion of the Grisons is divided into catholic and reformed. The doctrines of the reformation were first preached about the year 1524, and received at Fläsch, a small village in the Ten Juridictions upon the confines of Sargans; from thence they were extended to Mayenfeld and Malantz, and soon afterwards through the whole valley of Prättigau. The new opinions spread with such celerity, that before the end of the 16th century they were embraced by the whole league of the ten jurisdictions (excepting part of the community of Altenrhein), the greatest part of the House of God, and a few communities in the Grey League.\n\nThe difference of religion nearly excited a civil war between the two sects, as well as the first introduction of the Reformation as at the beginning of the troubles in the Valteline. In the latter instance, the two parties rose in arms; but the Catholics being overpowered by the Protestants, matters were amicably adjusted. Since that period all religious concerns have been regulated with perfect cordiality. According to the general consent of the three leagues, each community being absolute within its little territory, has the power of appointing its own particular worship, and the inhabitants are free to follow either the Catholic or Reformed persuasion. In the administration of civil affairs religion has no interference: the deputies of the general diet may be members of either communion, as chosen by the communities which they represent. By this moderate and tolerating principle, all religious dissensions have been suppressed as much as possible; and the most perfect amity subsists between the two sects.\n\nIn spiritual concerns, the Catholics for the most part are under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Coire. For the affairs of the Reformed churches, each league is divided into a certain number of districts, the ministers whereof assemble twice every year: these assemblies are called colloquia. Each colloquium has its president, and each league a superintendent called a dean. The supreme authority in spiritual concerns is vested in the synod, which is composed of the three deans, and the clergy of each league; the synod assembles every year alternately in each of the three leagues. Candidates for holy orders are examined before the synod. The necessary qualifications for admission into the church ought to be the knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and Latin; but this rule is not strictly adhered to; many being ordained without the least acquaintance with either of those languages. Formerly Latin was solely used, as well in the debates of the synod as for the purpose of examining the candidates; but at present that tongue grows more and more into disuse, and German is employed in its stead.\n\nThe number of reformed parishes in the whole three leagues amounts to 135, in the following proportion:\n\n—In the Grey League 46, in that of God's House 53, and in the League of Ten Jurisdictions 36. The ministers of these churches enjoy but very small salaries. The richest benefices do not perhaps yield more than 20l. or at most 25l. per annum, and the poorest sometimes scarcely 6l. This scanty income is attended with many inconveniences. It obliges the clergy who have families to follow some branch of traffic, to the neglect of their ecclesiastical studies, and to the degradation of the professional character. Another inconvenience is superadded to the narrowness of their income. In most communities the ministers, though confirmed by the synod, are chosen by the people of the parish, and are solely dependent on their bounty. For these reasons, the candidates for holy orders are generally extremely ignorant. They cannot support that expense which is requisite to pursue their studies; they are not animated with the expectation of a decent competence; and, from the dependent mode of their election, are not encouraged to deserve their promotion by a confident dignity of character.\n\nGRIST, in country affairs, denotes corn ground, or ready for grinding.\n\nGRIT, or gritstone, a kind of stone which is used for building and for millstones and grindstones; and sometimes for filtering water.\n\nGROAT, an English money of account, equal to four pence. Other nations, as the Dutch, Poles, Saxons, Bohemians, French, &c. have likewise their groats, groots, groches, gros, &c. In the Saxon times, no silver coin bigger than a penny was struck in England, nor after the conquest, till Edward III. who, about the year 1351, coined groatles, i.e. groats, or great pieces, which went for 4d. a-piece: and so the matter stood till the reign of Henry VIII. who, in 1504, first coined shillings.\n\nGROATS, in country affairs, oats after the hulls are off, or great oat-meal.\n\nGROCERS, anciently were such persons as engrossed all merchandise that was vendible; but now they are incorporated, and make one of the companies of the city of London, which deals in sugar, foreign fruits, spices, &c.\n\nGROENLAND, or SPITZBERGEN. See GREENLAND.\n\nGROGRAM, a kind of stuff made of silk and mohair.\n\nGROIN, that part of the belly next the thigh.\n\nGROIN, among builders, is the angular curve made by the intersection of two semi-cylinders or arches; and is either regular or irregular.—A regular groin is when the intersecting arches, whether semicircular or semielliptical, are of the same diameters and heights. An irregular groin is where one of the arches is semicircular and the other semielliptical.\n\nGROMWELL. See LITHOSPERMUM, BOTANY.\n\nGRONINGEN, the most northerly of the Seven United\nGroningen United Provinces, is bounded on the north by the German ocean; on the south, by the county of Drenthe; on the east, by the bishopric of Munster, and the principality of East-Friesland; and on the west by the province of Friesland, from which it is parted by the river Lavers. Its greatest length from south-east to north-west is about 47 miles; but its breadth is very unequal, the greatest being about 33 miles. Here are rich pastures, large herds of great and small cattle, plenty of sea and river fish, and of turf, with some forests and corn-land. There are several rivers in the province, of which the principal is the Hunse; and a great number of canals and dykes. The States consist of the deputies of the town of Groningen, and the Ommeland, or circumjacent country; and hold their assemblies always in the town of Groningen. The province had anciently governors, under the title of burggraves; but their power being limited, the people enjoyed great privileges. Afterwards it became subject to the bishop of Utrecht; but shook off his yoke at last, and recovered its liberty. In 1536 it submitted to Charles V. and in 1579 acceded to the union of Utrecht. The colleges before the revolution were much the same here as in the other provinces, viz. the provincial states, council of state, provincial tribunal, and chamber of accounts; and fix deputies were sent to the states-general. Of the established clergy there are 160 ministers, which form seven classes, whose annual synod is held, by turns, at Groningen and Appingedam.\n\nGroningen, the capital of the province of that name, is situated about 12 miles from the nearest shore of the German ocean, at the confluence of several rivulets, which form the Hunse and Fivel. Ships of considerable burden can come up to the city, in consequence of which it enjoys a pretty good trade. It was formerly very strong, but its fortifications are now much neglected. The university here was founded in 1615, and is well endowed out of the revenues of the ancient monasteries. The town, which was formerly one of the Hanse, and has still great privileges, is large and populous, being the seat of the high colleges, and containing three spacious market-places, and 27 streets, in which are many fine houses, besides churches and other public structures. By the river Fivel and the Ems, it has a communication with Westphalia. In 1672 it made such a gallant resistance against the bishop of Munster, that he is said to have lost 10,000 men before it. Rodolphus Agricola and Veselius, two of the most learned men of the age in which they lived, were born here. Under the jurisdiction of this city is a considerable district, called the Gorrecht. E. Long. 6. 25. Lat. 53. 10.\n\nGronovia, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clasps; and in the natural method ranking under the 34th order, Cucurbitaceae. See Botany Index.\n\nGronovius, John Frederic, a very learned critic, was born at Hamburg in 1613; and having travelled through Germany, Italy, and France, was made professor of polite learning at Deventer, and afterwards at Leyden, where he died in 1671. He published, 1. Diatribe in Statii, &c. 2. De sefertiss. 3. Correct editions of Seneca, Statius, T. Livy, Pliny's Natural History, Tacitus, Aulus Gellius, Phaedrus's Fables, &c. with notes; and other works.\n\nGronovius, James, son of the preceding, and a very learned man, was educated first at Leyden, then went over to England, where he visited the universities, consulted the curious MSS., and formed an acquaintance with several learned men. He was chosen by the grand duke to be professor at Pila, with a considerable stipend. He returned into Holland, after he had resided two years in Tuscany, and consulted the MSS. in the Medicean library. In 1679, he was invited by the curators of the university to a professorship; and his inaugural dissertation was so highly approved of, that the curators added 400 florins to his stipend, and this augmentation continued to his death in 1716. He refused several honourable and advantageous offers. His principal works are, The Treasure of Greek Antiquities, in 13 vols. folio; and a great number of dissertations and editions of ancient authors. He was compared to Schiopppus for the vivacity of his style; and the severity with which he treated other great men who differed from him, exposed him to just censure.\n\nGroom, a name particularly applied to several superior officers belonging to the king's household, as groom of the chamber, groom of the stole. See Stole, and Wardrobe.\n\nGroom is more particularly used for a servant appointed to attend on horses in the stable.—The word is formed from the Flemish grom, \"a boy.\"\n\nGroove, among miners, is the shaft or pit sunk into the earth, sometimes in the vein, and sometimes not.\n\nGroove, among joiners, the channel made by their plough in the edge of a moulding, flake, or rail, to put their panels in, in wainscotting.\n\nGrose, Francis, Esq. F. A. S. was born about the year 1731, and was the son of Mr. Francis Grose, a jeweller of Richmond, by whom the coronation crown of George II. was filled up. Young Grose obtained an independent fortune by the death of his father, which happened in the year 1769. He was paymaster and adjutant in the Surrey militia, but dissipation so far prevented him for some time from paying proper attention to his duty, that in his own humorous mode of expressing himself, he kept but two books of accounts, his right and left hand pockets. The losses which this thoughtless conduct occasioned him, awakened his dormant talents, and he resolved to turn his attention to literary pursuits. His education was classical, to which he united an excellent taste for drawing, which induced him to commence his \"Views of Antiquities in England and Wales.\" He began this work in numbers in 1773, and completed it in 1776; and by it he obtained both reputation and profit, the latter of which his almost unpardonable liberality had rendered extremely needful. In 1777 he added other two volumes to his English views, which included the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, finished in 1778. All his expectations were fully gratified by the publication of this work, and during the remainder of his life he continued to publish others, which in general increased his reputation as an author, and always tended to augment his wealth. In the summer of 1789 he paid a visit to Scotland, and in 1790\n1790 began to publish in numbers, his views taken in that country. He next proceeded to Ireland, with a view to give a similar description of that country; but on the 6th of May 1791, while at Dublin in the house of Mr. Horne, he was instantly seized at table with an apoplectic fit, and immediately expired. He was buried in Drumcondra churchyard near Dublin.\n\nAlthough his literature was very respectable, it was even exceeded by his good humour, by his convivial and friendly turn of mind. As both at home and abroad he was always in the best company, his knowledge of the world was so extensive, that his conversation was always useful and entertaining. He was free from the malignity and pride of some authors, for as he felt the independence of his own talents, he scorned to degrade others. Of the most careless, open, and artless disposition, he was often the prey of the designing, and has more than once embarrassed himself by too implicit confidence in the probity of others. A tale of distress never failed to touch his heart, and make the tear of commiseration glide down his cheek.\n\nBesides the works formerly mentioned, he published a treatise on ancient armour and weapons; a classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue, military antiquities, &c.\n\nGROSS, a foreign money, in divers countries, answering to our groat.\n\nGross is used among us for the quantity of twelve dozen.\n\nGross weight, is the weight of merchandises and goods, with their dust and dross, as also, of the bag, cask, chest, &c., wherein they are contained; out of which gross weight, allowance is to be made of tare and tret.\n\nGross, or Groffus, in our ancient law-writers, denotes a thing absolute, and not depending on another. Thus, villain in grofs, villanus in groffo, was a servant, who did not belong to the land, but immediately to the person of the lord; or a servile person not appendant, or annexed to the lord or manor, and to go along with the tenures as appurtenant to it; but like other personal goods and chattels of his lord, at his lord's pleasure and disposal.\n\nGross, advowson in. See Advowson.\n\nGross-beak, the trivial name of the cocothraustes, or hawfinch, which is the Loxia cocothraustes. See Ornithology Index.\n\nGrossularia, the gooseberry. See Ribes, Botany Index.\n\nGrotesque, or Grotesk, in sculpture and painting, somewhat whimsical, extravagant, and monstrous; consisting either of things that are merely imaginary, and have no existence in nature; or of things so distorted, as to raise surprize and ridicule. The names arise hence, that figures of this kind were anciently much used to adorn the grottoes wherein the tombs of eminent persons or families were inclosed. Such was that of Ovid, whose grotto was discovered near Rome about one hundred years ago.\n\nGrotius, Hugo, or more properly Hugo de Groot, one of the greatest men in Europe, was born at Delft in 1583. He made so rapid a progress in his studies, that at the age of 15 he had attained a great knowledge in philosophy, divinity, and civil law; and a yet greater proficiency in polite literature, as appeared by the commentary he had made at that age on Martianus Capella. In 1598, he accompanied the Dutch ambassador into France, and was honoured with several marks of esteem by Henry V. He took his degree of doctor of laws in that kingdom; and at his return to his native country, devoted himself to the bar, and pleaded before he was 17 years of age. He was not 24 when he was appointed attorney-general. In 1613 he settled in Rotterdam, and was nominated syndic of that city; but did not accept of the office till a promise was made him that he should not be removed from it. This prudent precaution he took from his foreseeing, that the quarrels of the divines on the doctrine of grace, which had already given rise to many factions in the state, would occasion revolutions in the chief cities. The same year he was sent into England, on account of the divisions that reigned between the traders of the two nations, on the right of fishing in the northern seas; but he could obtain no satisfaction. He was afterwards sent to England, as it is thought, to persuade the king and the principal divines to favour the Arminians; and he had several conferences with King James on that subject. On his return to Holland, his attachment to Barneveld involved him in great trouble; for he was seized, and sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in 1619, and to forfeit all his goods and chattels. But after having been treated with great rigour for above a year and a half in his confinement, he was delivered by the advice and artifice of his wife, who having observed that his keepers had often fatigued themselves with searching and examining a great trunk full of foul linen which used to be walked at Gorkum, but now let to pass without opening it, she advised him to bore holes in it to prevent his being stifled, and then to get into it. He complied with this advice, and was carried to a friend's house in Gorkum; where dressing himself like a mason, and taking a rule and trowel, he passed through the marketplace, and stepping into a boat went to Vallet in Brabant. Here he made himself known to some Arminians, and hired a carriage to Antwerp. At first there was a design of prosecuting his wife, who stood in the prison; and some judges were of opinion that she ought to be kept there in her husband's stead; however, she was released by a plurality of voices, and universally applauded for her behaviour. He now retired into France, where he met with a gracious reception from that court, and Louis XIII. settled a pension upon him. Having resided there eleven years, he returned to Holland, on his receiving a very kind letter from Frederic Henry prince of Orange: but his enemies renewing their persecution, he went to Hamburgh; where, in 1634, Queen Christina of Sweden made him her counsellor, and sent him ambassador into France. After having discharged the duties of this office above eleven years, he returned, in order to give an account to Queen Christina of his embassy; when he took Holland in his way, and received many honours at Amsterdam. He was introduced to her Swedish majesty at Stockholm; and there begged that she would grant his dismissal, in order that he might return to Holland. This he obtained with difficulty; and the queen gave him many marks of her esteem, though he had many enemies at this court. As he was returning, the ship in which\nwhich he embarked was cast away on the coast of Pomerania; and being now sick, he continued his journey by land; but was forced to stop at Rostock, where he died, on the 28th of August 1645. His body was carried to Delft, to be interred in the sepulchre of his ancestors. Notwithstanding the embassies in which he was employed, he composed a great number of excellent works; the principal of which are,\n\n1. A treatise De jure belli et pacis, which is esteemed a master-piece.\n2. A treatise on the truth of the Christian religion.\n3. Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures.\n4. The history and annals of Holland.\n5. A great number of letters. All which are written in Latin.\n\nGROTSKAW, a town of Turkey in Europe, in the province of Servia, where a battle was fought between the Germans and Turks, in the year 1739, in which the Germans were forced to retreat with loss. E. Long. 21°. N. Lat. 45°.\n\nGROTSKAW, a strong town of Germany, capital of a province of the same name in Silegia. It is very agreeably seated in a fruitful plain. E. Long. 17°. N. Lat. 50°.\n\nGROTTA, or GROTTA, a large deep cavern or den in a mountain or rock. The word is Italian, grotta, formed, according to Menage, &c., from the Latin crypta. Du Cange observes, that grotta was used in the same sense in the corrupt Latin.\n\nThe ancient anchorites retired into dens and grottoes, to apply themselves the more attentively to meditation.\n\nOkey-hole, Elden-hole, Peak's-hole, and Pool's-hole, are famous among the natural caverns or grottoes of our country.\n\nThe entrance to Okey-hole, on the south side of Mendip-hills, is in the fall of those hills, which is beset all about with rocks, and has near it a precipitate descent of near twelve fathoms deep, at the bottom of which there continually issues from the rocks a considerable current of water. The naked rocks above the entrance show themselves about 30 fathoms high, and the whole ascent of the hill above is about a mile, and is very steep. As you pass into this vault, you go at first upon a level, but advancing farther, the way is found to be rocky and uneven, sometimes ascending and sometimes descending. The roof of this cavern, in the highest part, is about eight fathoms from the ground, but in many particular places it is so low, that a man must stoop to get along. The breadth is not less various than the height, for in some places it is five or six fathoms wide, and in others not more than one or two. It extends itself in length about two hundred yards. People talk much of certain stones in it, resembling men and women, and other things; but there is little matter of curiosity in these, being only shapeless lumps of a common spar. At the farthest part of the cavern there is a good stream of water, large enough to drive a mill, which passes all along one side of the cavern, and at length slides down about six or eight fathoms among the rocks, and then pressing through the clefts of them, discharges itself into the valley. The river within the cavern is well stored with eels, and has some trouts in it; and these cannot have come from without, there being no great a fall near the entrance. In dry summers, a great number of frogs are seen all along this cavern, even to the farther part of it; and on the roof of it, at certain places, hang vast numbers of bats, as they do in almost all caverns, the entrance of which is either level, or but slightly ascending or descending; and even in the more perpendicular ones they are sometimes found, provided they are not too narrow, and are sufficiently high. The cattle that feed in the pastures through which this river runs, have been known to die suddenly sometimes after a flood; this is probably owing to the waters having been impregnated, either naturally or accidentally, with lead ore.\n\nElden hole is a huge profound perpendicular chasm, three miles from Buxton, ranked among the natural wonders of the Peak. Its depth is unknown, and is pretended to be unfathomable. Cotton tells us he sounded 884 yards; yet the plummet still drew. But he might easily be deceived, unless his plummet was very heavy; the weight of a rope of that length might well make the landing of the plummet scarce perceptible.\n\nPeak's-hole, and Pool's-hole, called also the Devil's A—se, are two remarkable horizontal springs under mountains; the one near Cafferton, the other just by Buxton. They seem to have owed their origin to the springs which have their current through them; when the water had forced its way through the horizontal fissures of the strata, and had carried the loose earth away with it, the loose stones must fall down of course; and where the strata had few or no fissures, they remained entire; and so formed these very irregular arches, which are now so much wondered at. The water which passes through Pool's hole is impregnated with particles of limestone, and has incrusted the whole cavern in such a manner that it appears as one solid rock.\n\nIn grottoes are frequently found crystals of the rock, stalactites, and other natural conglomérations, and those often of an amazing beauty. M. Homberg conjectures, from several circumstances, that the marble pillars in the grotto of Antiparos vegetate or grow. That author looks on this grotto as a garden, whereof the pieces of marble are the plants; and endeavours to show, that they could only be produced by some vegetative principle. See ANTIPAROS.\n\nAt Foligno in Italy is another grotto, consisting of pillars and orders of architecture of marble, with their ornaments, &c., scarcely inferior to those of art; but they all grow downwards: so that if this too be a garden, the plants are turned upside down.\n\nGrotto del Cani, a little cavern near Pozzuoli, four leagues from Naples, the air of which is of a mephitical or noxious quality; whence also it is called bocca venenosa, the poisonous mouth.\n\nTwo miles from Naples (says Dr Mead), just by the Lago de Agnano, is a celebrated mofeta, commonly called la Grotto del Cani, and equally destructive to all within the reach of its vapours. It is a small grotto about eight feet high, twelve long, and six broad; from the ground arises a thin, fustle, warm fume, visible enough to a discerning eye, which does not spring up in little parcels here and there, but in one continued stream, covering the whole surface of the bottom of the cave; having this remarkable difference from common vapours, that it does not like smoke disperse itself into the air, but quickly after its rise falls back again, and returns\nreturns to the earth; the colour of the sides of the grotto being the measure of its ascent: for so far it is of a darkish-green, but higher only common earth. And as I myself found no inconvenience by standing in it, for no animal, if its head be above this mark, is the least injured. But when, as the manner is, a dog, or any other creature, it forcibly kept below it; or, by reason of its smallness, cannot hold its head above it, it presently loses all motion, falls down as dead, or in a swoon; the limbs convulsed and trembling, till at last no more signs of life appear than a very weak and almost insensible beating of the heart and arteries; which, if the animal be left a little longer, quickly ceases too, and then the case is irrecoverable; but if it be snatch out, and laid in the open air, it soon comes to life again, and sooner if thrown into the adjacent lake.\" The fumes of the grotto, the same author argues, are no real poison, but act chiefly by their gravity; else the creatures could not recover so soon, or if they did, some symptoms, as faintness, &c. would be the consequence of it. He adds, \"that in creatures killed therewith, when dissected, no marks of infection appear; and that the attack proceeds from a want of air, by which the circulation tends to an entire stoppage; and this so much the more, as the animal inspires a fluid of a quite different nature from the air, and so in no respect fit to supply its place. Taking the animal out, while yet alive, and throwing it into the neighbouring lake, it recovers: this is owing to the coldness of the water, which promotes the contraction of the fibres, and assists the retarded circulation; the small portion of air which remains in the vesicles, after every expiration, may be sufficient to drive out the noxious fluid. After the same manner, cold water acts in a deliquium animi: the lake of Agnano has no greater virtue in it than others.\"\n\nThe air in this grotto was for a long time reckoned to be of a poisonous nature, and thought to suffocate the animals which breathed it. Dr Hales imagined that it destroyed the elasticity of the air, caused the vesicles of the lungs to collapse, and thus occasioned sudden death.—It is now, however, found that this air is nothing else than fixed air, or carbonic acid gas, which issues from the earth in that place in great quantity.\n\nGrotto del Serpi, is a subterraneous cavern near the village of Saffa, eight miles from the city of Bracciano in Italy, described by Kircher thus: \"The grotto del serpi is big enough to hold two persons. It is perforated with several fissural apertures, somewhat in manner of a sieve; out of which, at the beginning of the spring season, issues a numerous brood of young snakes of divers colours, but all free from any particular poisonous quality. In this cave they expose their lepers, paralytics, arthritics, and elephantiac patients, quite naked; where, the warmth of the subterraneous streams resolving them into a sweat, and the serpents clinging variously all around, licking and sucking them, they become so thoroughly freed of all their vicious humours, that, upon repeating the operation for some time, they become perfectly restored.\"\n\nThis cave Kircher visited himself; and found it warm, and every way agreeable to the description given of it. He saw the holes, and heard a murmuring hissing noise in them. Though he missed feeding the serpents, it not being the season of their creeping out; yet he saw a great number of their exuviae, or sloughs, and an elm growing hard by laden with them.\n\nThe discovery of this cave was by the cure of a Museum leper going from Rome to some baths near this place. Losing his way, and being benighted, he happened upon this cave. Finding it very warm, he pulled off his clothes; and being weary and sleepy, had the good fortune not to feel the serpents about him till they had wrought his cure.\n\nMilky Grotto, Crypta Lactea, a mile distant from the ancient village of Bethlehem, is said to have been thus denominated on occasion of the blest Virgin, who let fall some drops of milk in giving suck to Jesus in this grotto. And hence it has been commonly supposed, that the earth of this cavern has the virtue of restoring milk to women that are grown dry, and even of curing fevers. Accordingly, they are always digging in it, and the earth is sold at a good rate to such as have faith enough to give credit to the fable. An altar has been built on the place, and a church just by it.\n\nGrotto, is also used for a little artificial edifice made in a garden, in imitation of a natural grotto. The outsides of these grottoes are usually adorned with rustic architecture, and their inside with shell-work, fossils, &c. finished likewise with jets d'eau or fountains, &c.\n\nA cement for artificial grottoes may be made thus: Take two parts of white rosin, melt it clear, and add to it four parts of bees wax: when melted together, add two or three parts of the powder of the stone you design to cement, or so much as will give the cement the colour of the stone: to this add one part of flower of sulphur: incorporate all together over a gentle fire, and afterwards knead them with your hands in warm water. With this cement the stones, shells, &c. after being well dried before the fire, may be cemented.\n\nArtificial red coral branches, for the embellishment of grottoes, may be made in the following manner: Take clear rosin, dissolve it in a brass-pan; to every ounce of which add two drams of the finest vermilion: when you have stirred them well together, and have chosen your twigs and branches, peeled and dried, take a pencil and paint the branches all over whilst the composition is warm; afterwards shape them in imitation of natural coral. This done, hold the branches over a gentle coal fire, till all is smooth and even as if polished. In the same manner white coral may be prepared with white lead, and black-coral with lamp-black.\n\nA grotto may be built with little expense, of glaas, cinders, pebbles, pieces of large flint, shells, mofs, stones, counterfeit coral, pieces of chalk, &c. all bound or cemented together with the above described cement.\n\nGROVE, in Gardening, a small wood impervious to the rays of the sun.\n\nGroves have been in all ages held in great veneration. The profeuchæ, and high-places of the Jews, whither they resorted for the purposes of devotion, were probably situated in groves: See Joshua xxiv. 26. The profeuchæ in Alexandria, mentioned by Philo, had\nGROVE had groves about them, because he complains that the Alexandrians, in a tumult against the Jews, cut down the trees of their profeciae.\n\nThe ancient Romans had a sort of groves near several of their temples, which were consecrated to some god, and called luci, by antiphrasis, à non lucendo, as being shady and dark. The veneration which the ancient druids had for groves is well known.\n\nModern groves are not only great ornaments to gardens; but are also the greatest relief against the violent heats of the sun, affording shade to walk under in the hottest parts of the day, when the other parts of the garden are useless; so that every garden is defective which has not shade.\n\nGroves are of two sorts, viz. either open or close. Open groves are such as have large shady trees, which stand at such distances, as that their branches approach so near to each other as to prevent the rays of the sun from penetrating through them.\n\nClose groves have frequently large trees standing in them; but the ground under these is filled with shrubs or underwood; so that the walks which are in them are private, and screened from winds: by which means they are rendered agreeable for walking, at those times when the air is either too hot or too cold in the more exposed parts of the garden. These are often contrived so as to bound the open groves, and frequently to hide the walls or other inclosures of the garden: and when they are properly laid out, with dry walks winding through them, and on the sides of these sweet-smelling shrubs and flowers irregularly planted, they have a charming effect.\n\nGROVE, Henry, a learned and ingenious Presbyterian divine, was born at Taunton in Somersetshire, in 1683. Having obtained a sufficient stock of classical literature, he went through a course of academical learning, under the reverend Mr Warren of Taunton, who had a flourishing academy. He then removed to London, and studied some time under the reverend Mr Rowe, to whom he was nearly related. Here he contracted a friendship with several persons of merit, and particularly with Dr Watts, which continued till his death, though they were of different opinions in several points warmly controverted among divines. After two years spent under Mr Rowe, he returned into the country, and began to preach with great reputation; when an exact judgment, a lively imagination, and a rational and amiable representation of Christianity, delivered in a sweet and well-governed voice, rendered him generally admired; and the spirit of devotion which prevailed in his sermons procured him the esteem and friendship of Mrs Singer, afterwards Mrs Row, which she expressed in a fine ode on death, addressed to Mr Grove. Soon after his beginning to preach, he married; and on the death of Mr Warren, was chosen to succeed him in the academy at Taunton. This obliging him to reside there, he preached for 18 years to two small congregations in the neighbourhood; and though his salary from both was less than twenty pounds a-year, and he had a growing family, he went through it cheerfully. In 1708, he published a piece, entitled, The Regulation of Diversions, drawn up for the use of his pupils. About the same time, he entered into a private dispute by letter with Dr Samuel Clarke: but they not being able to convince each other, the debate was dropped with expressions of great mutual esteem. He next wrote several papers printed in the Spectator, viz. Numbers 588, 601, 626, 635. The last was republished, by the direction of Dr Gibbon bishop of London, in the Evidences of the Christian Religion, by Joseph Addison, Esq. In 1725, Mr James, his partner in the academy, dying, he succeeded him in his pastoral charge at Fulwood, near Taunton, and engaged his nephew to undertake the other parts of Mr James's work as tutor; and in this situation Mr Grove continued till his death, which happened in 1738. His great concern with his pupils, was to inspire and cherish in them a prevailing love of truth, virtue, liberty, and genuine religion, without violent attachments or prejudices in favour of any party of Christians. He represented truth and virtue in a most engaging light; and though his income, both as a tutor and a minister, was insufficient to support his family, without breaking into his paternal estate, he knew not how to refuse the call of charity. Besides the above pieces, he wrote,\n\n1. An Essay towards a demonstration of the Soul's Immortality. 2. An Essay on the Terms of Christian Communion. 3. The Evidence of our Saviour's Resurrection considered. 4. Some Thoughts concerning the Proof of a Future State from Reason. 5. A Discourse concerning the Nature and Design of the Lord's Supper. 6. Wisdom the first spring of Action in the Deity. 7. A Discourse on Saving Faith. 8. Miscellanies in prose and verse. 9. Many Sermons, &c. After his decease, his posthumous works were published by subscription, in four volumes octavo, with the names of near 700 subscribers, among whom were some of the best judges of merit in the established church.\n\nGROUND, in painting, the surface upon which the figures and other objects are represented.\n\nThe ground is properly understood of such parts of the piece as have nothing painted on them, but retain the original colour upon which the other colours are applied to make the representations.\n\nA building is said to serve as a ground to a figure when the figure is painted on the building.\n\nThe ground behind a picture in miniature is commonly blue or crimson, imitating a curtain of satin or velvet.\n\nGROUND, in etching, denotes a gummy composition smeared over the surface of the metal to be etched, to prevent the aquafortis from eating, except in such places where this ground is cut through with the point of a needle.

They are long narrow slips of land, ranging in all directions, some of them ten miles or upwards in length, but not more than a quarter of a mile broad. They abound in trees, particularly those of the cocoa nut. They are inhabited by well-made people, of a brown complexion. Most of them carried in their hands a slender pole about 14 feet in length, pointed like a spear; they had likewise something shaped like a paddle, about four feet long. Their canoes were of different sizes, carrying from three to six or seven people, and some of them hoisted a sail.\n\nGROUSE, or GROWSE, Moor-fowl, or Moor-game. See TETRAO, ORNITHOLOGY Index.\n\nGROUTHEAD, or GREATHEID, ROBERT, a learned and famous bishop of Lincoln, was born at Stow in Lincolnshire, or (according to others) at Stradbroke in Suffolk, in the latter part of the twelfth century. His parents were so poor, that when a boy he was reduced to do the meanest offices, and even to beg his bread; till the mayor of Lincoln, struck with his appearance and the quickness of his answers to certain questions, took him into his family, and put him to school. Here his ardent love of learning, and admirable capacity for acquiring it, soon appeared, and procured him many patrons, by whose affluence he was enabled to prosecute his studies, first at Cambridge, afterwards at Oxford, and at last at Paris. In these three famous seats of learning, he spent many years in the most indefatigable pursuit of knowledge, and became one of the best and most universal scholars of the age. He was a great master not only of the French and Latin, but also of the Greek and Hebrew languages, which was a very rare accomplishment in those times. We are assured by Roger Bacon, who was intimately acquainted with him, that he spent much of his time for almost forty years in the study of geometry, astronomy, optics, and other branches of mathematical learning, in all which he very much excelled. Theology was his favourite study, in which he read lectures at Oxford with great applause. In the mean time, he obtained several preferments in the church, and was at length elected and consecrated bishop of Lincoln, A.D. 1235. In this station he soon became very famous, by the purity of his manners, the popularity of his preaching, the vigour of his discipline, and the boldness with which he reproved the vices and opposed the arbitrary mandates of the court of Rome; of this last it may be proper to give one example. Pope Innocent IV. had granted to one of his own nephews named Frederick, who was but a child, a provision to the first canon's place in the church of Lincoln that should become vacant; and sent a bull to the archbishop of Canterbury, and Innocent, then papal legate in England, commanding them to see the provision made effectual; which they transmitted to the bishop of Lincoln. But that brave and virtuous prelate Grouthead, boldly refused to obey this unreasonable mandate, and sent an answer to the papal bull containing the following severe reproaches against his holiness for abusing his power: \"If we except the sins of Lucifer and Antichrist, there neither is nor can be a greater crime, nor anything more contrary to the doctrine of the gospel, or more odious and abominable in the sight of Jesus Christ, than to ruin and destroy the souls of men, by depriving them of the spiritual aid and ministry of their pastors. This crime is committed by those who command the benefices intended for the support of able pastors, to be bestowed on those who are incapable of performing the duties of the pastoral office. It is impossible therefore that the holy apostolic see, which received its authority from the Lord Jesus Christ, for edification, and not for destruction, can be guilty of such a crime, or anything approaching to such a crime, so hateful to God and so hurtful to men. For this would be a most manifest corruption and abuse of its authority, which would forfeit all its glory, and plunge it into the pains of hell.\" Upon hearing this letter, his holiness became frantic with rage, poured forth a torrent of abuse against the good bishop, and threatened to make him an object of terror and abomination to the whole world. \"How dare (said he) this old, deaf, dozing fool, disobey my commands? Is not his master the king of England my subject, or rather my slave? Cannot he cast him into prison, and crush him in a moment?\" But the cardinals by degrees brought the pope to think more calmly, and to take no notice of this letter. \"Let us not (said they) raise a tumult in the church without necessity, and precipitate that revolt and separation from us, which we know must one day take place.\" Remarkable words, when we reflect when and by whom they were spoken! The bishop did not long survive this noble stand against the grofs corruptions and tyranny of the church of Rome; for he fell sick at his castle of Bidden that same year; and when he became sensible that his death was drawing near, he called his clergy into his apartment, and made a long discourse to them, to prove that the reigning pope Innocent IV. was Antichrist. With this exertion his strength and spirits were so much exhausted, that he expired soon after, October 9, 1253. A contemporary historian, who was perfectly well acquainted with him, hath drawn his character in the following manner. \"He was a free and bold reprimander of the pope and the king; an admonisher of the prelates; a corrector of the monks; an instructor of the clergy; a supporter of the studious; a censor of the incendiary; a scourge and terror to the court of Rome; a diligent learner of the scriptures; and a frequent preacher to the people. At his table he was hospitable, polite, and cheerful. In the church he was contrite, devote, and solemn; and in performing all the duties of his office he was venerable, active, and indefatigable. The illustrious Roger Bacon, who was most capable, and had the best opportunities of forming a true judgment of the extent of his learning, by perusing his works, and by frequently conversing with him, hath given this honourable testimony in his favour. \"Robert Grouthead bishop of Lincoln, and his friend Friar Adam de Marisco, are the two most learned men in the world, and excel\nGrowth, excel all the rest of mankind both in divine and human knowledge.\" This most excellent and learned prelate was a very voluminous writer, and composed a prodigious number of treatises on a great variety of subjects in philosophy and divinity, a catalogue of which is given by Bale.\n\nGROWTH, the gradual increase of bulk and stature that takes place in animals or vegetables, to a certain period.—The increase of bulk in such bodies as have no life, owing to fermentations excited in their substance, or to other causes, is called EXPANSION, SWELLING, &c.\n\nThe growth of animals, nay even of the human species, is subject to great variations. A remarkable instance in the last was observed in France in the year 1729. At this time the Academy of Sciences examined a boy who was then only seven years old, and who measured four feet eight inches and four lines high without his shoes. His mother observed the signs of puberty on him at two years old, which continued to increase very quick, and soon arrived at the usual standard. At four years old he was able to lift and toss the common bundles of hay in stables into the horses racks; and at five years old could lift as much as a sturdy fellow of twenty. But though he thus increased in bodily strength, his understanding was no greater than is usual with children of his age, and their playthings were also his favourite amusements.\n\nAnother boy, a native of the hamlet of Bouzanquet, in the diocese of Alais, though of a strong constitution, appeared to be knit and stiff in his joints till he was about four years and a half old. During this time nothing farther was remarkable of him than an extraordinary appetite, which was satisfied no otherwise than by giving him plenty of the common aliments of the inhabitants of the country, consisting of rye-bread, chestnuts, bacon, and water; but his limbs soon becoming supple and pliable, and his body beginning to expand itself, he grew up in so extraordinary a manner, that at the age of five years he measured four feet three inches; some months after, he was four feet eleven inches; and at six, five feet, and bulky in proportion. His growth was so rapid, that one might fancy he saw him grow; every month, his clothes required to be made longer and wider; and what was still very extraordinary in his growth, it was not preceded by any sickness, nor accompanied with any pain in the groin or elsewhere. At the age of five years his voice changed, his beard began to appear, and at six he had as much as a man of thirty; in short, all the unquestionable marks of puberty were visible in him. It was not doubted in the country but this child was, at five years old, or five and a half, in a condition of begetting other children; which induced the rector of the parish to recommend to his mother that she would keep him from too familiar a conversation with children of the other sex. Though his wit was riper than is commonly observable at the age of five or six years, yet its progress was not in proportion to that of his body. His air and manner still retained something childish, though by his bulk and stature he resembled a complete man, which at first sight produced a very singular contrast. His voice was strong and manly, and his great strength rendered him already fit for the labours of the country.\n\nAt the age of five years, he could carry to a good distance three measures of rye, weighing 84 pounds; when turned of six, he could lift up easily on his shoulders and carry loads of 150 pounds weight a good way off; and these exercises were exhibited by him as often as the curious engaged him thereto by some liberality. Such beginnings made people think that he would soon shoot up into a giant. A mountebank was already soliciting his parents for him, and flattering them with hopes of putting him in a way of making a great fortune. But all these hopes suddenly vanished. His legs became crooked, his body shrunk, his strength diminished, his voice grew feebly weaker, and he at last sunk into a total imbecility.\n\nIn the Paris Memoirs also there is an account of a girl who had her menes at three months of age. When four years old, she was four feet six inches in height, and had her limbs well proportioned to that height, her breasts large and plump, and the parts of generation like those of a girl of eighteen; so that there is no doubt but that she was marriageable at that time, and capable of being a mother of children. These things are more singular and marvellous in the northern than in the southern climates, where the females come sooner to maturity. In some places of the East Indies, the girls have children at nine years of age.\n\nMany other instances of extraordinary growth might be brought, but the particulars are not remarkably different from those already related.—It is at first sight astonishing that children of such early and prodigious growth do not become giants; but when we consider, that the signs of puberty appear so much sooner than they ought, it seems evident that the whole is only a more than usually rapid expansion of the parts, as in hot climates; and accordingly it is observed, that such children, instead of becoming giants, always decay and die apparently of old age, long before the natural term of human life.\n\nGRUB, in Zoology, the English name of the hexapode worms, produced from the eggs of beetles, and which at length are transformed into winged insects of the same species with their parents.\n\nGRUBBING, in Agriculture, the digging or pulling up of the stubs and roots of trees.\n\nWhen the roots are large, this is a very troublesome and laborious task; but Mr Mortimer hath shown how it may be accomplished in such a manner as to save great expense by a very simple and easy method. He proposes a strong iron hook to be made about two feet four inches long, with a large iron ring fastened to the upper part of it. This hook must be put into a hole in the side of the root, to which it must be fastened; and a lever being put into the ring, three men, by means of this lever, may wring out the root, and twist the sap-roots afunder. Stubs of trees may also be taken up with the same hook, in which work it will save a great deal of labour, though not so much as in the other; because the stubs must be first cleft with wedges, before the hook can enter the sides of them, to wrench them out by pieces.\n\nGRUBENHAGEN, a town and castle of the duchy\nGruiiales duchy of Brunswick, in Lower Saxony, remarkable for its mines of silver, copper, iron, and lead.

He was but a child when his father and mother, being persecuted for the Protestant religion by the duches of Parma, governors of the Netherlands, carried him into England. He imbibed the elements of learning from his mother, who was one of the most learned women of the age, and besides French, Italian, and English, was a complete mistress of Latin, and well skilled in Greek. He spent some years in the university of Cambridge; after which he went to that of Leyden to study the civil law; but at last applied himself wholly to polite literature. After travelling much, he became professor in the university of Heidelberg; near which city he died in 1627. He wrote many works; the most considerable of which are, 1. A large collection of ancient inscriptions. 2. Theaurus criticus. 3.

Lat. 16. 30. W. Long. 61. 20. It was taken by the French in 1794, but retaken the same year.\n\nThis island, which is of an irregular figure, may be about 80 leagues in circumference. It is divided into two parts by a small arm of the sea, which is not above two leagues long, and from 15 to 40 fathoms broad. This canal, known by the name of the Salt River, is navigable, but will only carry vessels of 50 tons burden.\n\nThat part of the island which gives its name to the whole colony is, towards the centre, full of craggy rocks, where the cold is so intense, that nothing will grow upon them but fern, and some useless shrubs covered with moss. On the top of these rocks, a mountain called La Souphriere, or the Brimstone Mountain, rises to an immense height. It exhales, through various openings, a thick black smoke, intermixed with sparks that are visible by night. From all these hills flow numberless springs, which fertilize the plains below, and moderate the burning heat of the climate by a refreshing stream, so celebrated, that the galleons which formerly used to touch at the Windward islands, had orders to renew their provision with this pure and salubrious water. Such is that part of the island properly called Guadalupe. That which is commonly called Grand Terre, has not been so much favoured by nature. It is indeed less rugged; but it wants springs and rivers. The soil is not so fertile, or the climate so wholesome or so pleasant.\n\nNo European nation had yet taken possession of this island, when 550 Frenchmen, led on by two gentlemen named Loline and Duplessis, arrived there from Dieppe on the 28th of June 1635. They had been very imprudent in their preparations. Their provisions were too ill chosen, that they were spoiled in the passage, and they had shipped so few, that they were exhausted in two months. They were supplied with more from the mother-country. St Christopher's, whether from scarcity or design, refused to spare them any; and the first attempts in husbandry they made in the country could not as yet afford anything. No resource was left for the\nGuadalupe the colony but from the savages; but the superfluities of a people, who cultivate but little, and therefore had never laid up any flores, could not be very considerable. The new comers, not content with what the savages might freely and voluntarily bring, came to a resolution to plunder them; and hostilities commenced on the 16th of January 1636.\n\nThe Caribs, not thinking themselves in a condition openly to resist an enemy who had so much the advantage from the superiority of their arms, destroyed their own provisions and plantations, and retired to Grande Terre, or to the neighbouring islands. From thence the most desperate came over to the island from which they had been driven, and concealed themselves in the thickest parts of the forests. In the daytime, they shot with their poisoned arrows, or knocked down with their clubs, all the Frenchmen who were scattered about for hunting or fishing. In the night, they burned the houses and destroyed the plantations of their unjust spoilers.\n\nA dreadful famine was the consequence of this kind of war. The colonists were reduced to graze in the fields, to eat their own excrements, and to dig up dead bodies for their subsistence. Many who had been slaves at Algiers, held in abhorrence the hands that had broken their fetters; and all of them cursed their existence. It was in this manner that they atoned for the crime of their invasion, till the government of Aubert brought a peace with the savages at the end of the year 1640. The remembrance, however, of hardships endured in an invaded island, proved a powerful incitement to the cultivation of all articles of immediate necessity; which afterwards induced an attention to those of luxury consumed in the mother-country. The few inhabitants who had escaped the calamities they had drawn upon themselves, were soon joined by some discontented colonists from St Christopher's, by Europeans fond of novelty, by sailors tired of navigation, and by some sea-captains, who prudently chose to commit to the care of a grateful soil the treasures they had saved from the dangers of the sea. But still the prosperity of Guadalupe was stopped or impeded by obstacles arising from its situation.\n\nThe facility with which the pirates from the neighbouring islands could carry off their cattle, their slaves, their very crops, frequently brought them into a desperate situation. Intestine broils, arising from jealousies of authority, often disturbed the quiet of the planters. The adventurers who went over to the Windward islands, disdaining a land that was fitter for agriculture than for naval expeditions, were easily drawn to Martinico by the convenient roads it abounds with. The protection of those intrepid pirates brought to that island all the traders who flattered themselves that they might buy up the spoils of the enemy at a low price, and all the planters who thought they might safely give themselves up to peaceful labours. This quick population could not fail of introducing the civil and military government of the Caribbean islands into Martinico. From that time the French ministry attended more seriously to this than to the other colonies, which were not immediately under their direction; and hearing chiefly of this island, they turned all their encouragements that way.\n\nIt was in consequence of this preference, that in 1700 the number of inhabitants in Guadalupe amounted only to 3825 white people, 325 savages, free negroes, mulattoes, and 6725 slaves, many of whom were Caribs.\n\nAt the end of the year 1755, the colony was peopled with 9643 whites, 41,140 slaves of all ages and of both sexes. Her saleable commodities were the produce of 330 sugar-plantations, and 15 plots of indigo; besides cocoa, coffee, and cotton. Such was the state of Guadalupe when it was conquered by the British in the month of April 1759.\n\nFrance lamented this loss; but the colony had reason to comfort themselves for this disgrace. During a siege of three months, they had seen their plantations destroyed, the buildings that served to carry on their works burnt down, and some of their slaves carried off. Had the enemy been forced to retreat after all these devastations, the island was ruined. Deprived of all assistance from the mother-country, which was not able to send her any succours; and expecting nothing from the Dutch (who, on account of their neutrality, came into her roads), because she had nothing to offer them in exchange; she could never have subsisted till the ensuing harvest.\n\nThe conquerors delivered them from these apprehensions. The British, indeed, are no merchants in their colonies. The proprietors of lands, who mostly reside in Europe, send to their representatives whatever they want, and draw the whole produce of the estate by the return of their ship. An agent settled in some sea-port of Great Britain is intrusted with the furnishing the plantation and receiving the produce. This was impracticable at Guadalupe; and the conquerors in this respect were obliged to adopt the custom of the conquered. The British, informed of the advantage the French made of their trade with the colonies, hastened, in imitation of them, to send their ships to the conquered island; and so multiplied their expeditions, that they overflocked the market, and sunk the price of all European commodities. The colonists bought them at a very low price; and, in consequence of this plenty, obtained long delays for the payment.\n\nTo this credit, which was necessary, was soon added another arising from speculation, which enabled the colony to fulfil its engagements. A great number of negroes were carried thither, to hasten the growth and enhance the value of the plantations. It has been said in various memorials, all copied from each other, that the English had stocked Guadalupe with 30,000 during the four years and three months that they remained masters of the island. The registers of the custom-houses, which may be depended on, as there could be no inducement for an imposition, attest that the number was no more than 18,721. This was sufficient to give the nation well-grounded hopes of reaping great advantages from their new conquest. But their hopes were frustrated; and the colony, with its dependencies, was restored to its former possessors by the treaty of peace in July 1763.\n\nBy the survey taken in 1767, this island, including the smaller islands, Defeada, St Bartholomew, Marigalante, and the Saints, dependent upon it, contains 11,863 white people of all ages and of both sexes, 752 free blacks and mulattoes, 72,761 slaves; which makes in all a population of 85,376 souls.\nThe produce of Guadalupe, including what is poured in from the small islands under her dominion, ought to be very considerable. But in 1768 it yielded to the mother-country no more than 140,418 quintals of fine sugar, 23,623 quintals of raw sugar, 34,205 quintals of coffee, 11,955 quintals of cotton, 456 quintals of cocoa, and 1854 quintals of ginger. Guadalupe was taken by the British in 1794; but it was retaken the same year.\n\nGUADIANA, a large river of Spain, having its source in New Castile, and, passing across the high mountains, falls down to the lakes called Ojos de Guadiana; from whence it runs to Calatrava, Medelin, Merida, and Badajoz in Estremadura of Spain; and after having run for some time in Alentejo in Portugal, it passes on to separate the kingdom of Algarve from Andalusia, and falls into the bay or gulf of Cadiz, between Castro Marino and Agramonte.\n\nGUADIX, a town of Spain, in the kingdom of Granada, with a bishop's see. It was taken from the Moors in 1253, who afterwards retook it, but the Spaniards again got possession of it in 1489. It is seated in a fertile country, in W. Long. 2° 47'. N.

See BOTANY and MATERIA MEDICA Index.\n\nGUALEOR, GUALIOR, or Goualier, a large town of Hindoostan in Asia, and capital of a province of the same name, with an ancient and celebrated fortress of great strength. It is situated in the very heart of Hindoostan Proper, being about 80 miles to the south of Agra, the ancient capital of the empire, and 130 from the nearest part of the Ganges. From Calcutta it is, by the nearest route, upwards of 800 miles, and 910 by the ordinary one; and about 280 from the British frontiers. Its latitude is 26° 14' and longitude 78° 26' from Greenwich.\n\nIn the ancient division of the empire it is clasped in the foubah of Agra, and is often mentioned in history. In the year 1088, and during the two following centuries, it was thrice reduced by famine. It is probable that it must in all ages have been deemed a military post of the utmost consequence, both from its situation in respect to the capital, and from the peculiarity of its site, which was generally deemed impregnable. With respect to its relative position, it must be considered that it stands on the principal road leading from Agra to Malwa, Guzerat, and the Decan; and that too, near the place where it enters the hilly tract which advances from Bundelcund, Malwa, and Agimere, to a parallel with the river Jumna, throughout the greatest part of its course. And from all these circumstances of general and particular situation, together with its natural and acquired advantages as a fortress, the possession of it was deemed as necessary to the ruling emperors of Hindoostan as Dover castle might have been to the Saxon and Norman kings of England.—Its palace was used as a state prison as early as 1317, and continued to be such until the downfall of the empire.—On the final dismemberment of the empire, Gualior appears to have fallen to the lot of a rajah of the Jat tribe; who assumed the government of the district in which it is immediately situated, under the title of Rana of Gualior, or Goldh. Since that period it has changed masters more than once; the Mahrattas, whose dominions extend to the neighbourhood of it, having sometimes possessed it, and at other times the Rana; but the means of transfer were always either famine or treachery, nothing like a siege having ever been attempted.\n\nGualior was in the possession of Madajee Scindia, a Mahratta chief, in 1779; at the close of which year the council-general of Bengal concluded an alliance with the Rana; in consequence of which four battalions of sepoys of 500 men each, and some pieces of artillery, were sent to his assistance, his district being overrun by the Mahrattas, and himself almost shut up in his fort of Goldh. The grand object of this alliance was to penetrate into Scindia's country, and finally to draw Scindia himself from the western side of India, where he was attending the motions of General Goddard, who was then employed in the reduction of Guzerat; it being Mr Hastings's idea, that when Scindia found his own dominions in danger, he would detach himself from the confederacy, of which he was the principal member, and thus leave matters open for an accommodation with the court of Poonah. It fell out exactly as Mr Hastings predicted. Major William Popham was appointed to the command of the little army sent to the Rana's assistance; and was very successful, as well in clearing his country of the enemy, as in driving them out of one of their own most valuable districts, and keeping possession of it; and Mr Hastings, who justly concluded that the capture of Gualior, if practicable, would not only open the way into Scindia's country, but would also add to the reputation of our arms in a degree much beyond the risk and expense of the undertaking, repeatedly expressed his opinion to Major Popham, together with a wish that it might be attempted; and founding his hopes of success on the confidence that the garrison would probably have in the natural strength of the place. It was accordingly undertaken; and the following account of the place, and the manner of our getting possession of it, was written by Captain Jonathan Scott, at that time Persian interpreter to Major Popham, to his brother Major John Scott.\n\n\"The fortress of Gualior stands on a vast rock of about four miles in length, but narrow, and of unequal breadth, and nearly flat at the top. The sides are so steep as to appear almost perpendicular in every part; for where it was not naturally so, it has been scraped away; and the height from the plain below is from 200 to 300 feet. The rampart conforms to the edge of the precipice all round; and the only entrance to it is by steps running up the side of the rock, defended on the side next the country by a wall and bastions, and farther guarded by seven stone gateways, at certain distances from each other. The area within is full of noble buildings, reservoirs of water, wells, and cultivated land; so that it is really a little district in itself. At the north-west foot of the mountain is the town, pretty large, and well built; the houses all of stone. To have besieged this place would be vain, for nothing but a surprize or blockade could have carried it.\n\n\"A tribe of banditti from the district of the Rana had...\"\nGualear had been accustomed to rob about this town, and once in the dead of night had climbed up the rock and got into the fort. This intelligence they had communicated to the Rana, who often thought of availing himself of it, but was fearful of undertaking an enterprise of such moment with his own troops. At length he informed Major Popham of it, who sent a party of the robbers to conduct some of his own spies to the spot. They accordingly climbed up in the night, and found that the guards generally went to sleep after their rounds. Popham now ordered ladders to be made; but with so much secrecy, that until the night of surprise only myself and a few others knew it. On the 3rd of August, in the evening, a party was ordered to be in readiness to march under the command of Captain William Bruce; and Popham put himself at the head of two battalions, which were immediately to follow the storming party. To prevent as much as possible any noise in approaching or ascending the rock, a kind of shoes of woollen cloth were made for the sepoys, and stuffed with cotton. At 11 o'clock the whole detachment marched from the camp at Keypour, eight miles from Gualear, through unfrequented paths, and reached it at a little before daybreak. Just as Captain Bruce arrived at the foot of the rock, he saw the lights which accompanied the rounds moving along the rampart, and heard the sentinels cough (the mode of signifying that all is well in an Indian camp or garrison), which might have damped the spirit of many men, but served only to inspire him with more confidence, as the moment for action, that is, the interval between the passing the rounds was now ascertained. Accordingly when the lights were gone, the wooden ladders were placed against the rock, and one of the robbers first mounted, and returned with an account that the guard was retired to sleep. Lieutenant Cameron, our engineer, next mounted, and tied a rope-ladder to the battlements of the wall; this kind of ladder being the only one adapted to the purpose of scaling the wall in a body (the wooden ones only serving to ascend from crag to crag of the rock, and to assist in fixing the rope-ladders). When all was ready, Captain Bruce with 20 sepoys, grenadiers, ascended without being discovered, and squatted down under the parapet; but before a reinforcement arrived, three of the party had so little recollection as to fire on some of the garrison who happened to be lying asleep near them. This had nearly ruined the whole plan: the garrison were of course alarmed, and ran in great numbers towards the place; but ignorant of the strength of the assailants (as the men fired on had been killed outright), they suffered themselves to be stopped by the warm fire kept up by the small party of the grenadiers, until Major Popham himself, with a considerable reinforcement, came to their aid. The garrison then retreated to the inner buildings, and discharged a few rockets, but soon afterwards retreated precipitately through the gate; whilst the principal officers, thus deserted, assembled together in one house, and hung out a flag. Major Popham sent an officer to give them assurance of quarter and protection; and thus, in the space of two hours, this important and astonishing fortress was completely in our possession. We had only 20 men wounded and one killed. On the side of the enemy, Bapogee the governor was killed, and most of the principal officers wounded.\n\nThus fell the strongest fortress in Hindostan, garnished by a chosen body of 1200 men, on August 4, 1783; and which, before the capture of it by the British, was pronounced by the princes of Hindostan, as far as their knowledge in the military art extended, to be impregnable. In 1783 Madajee Scindia besieged this fortress, then possessed by the Rana of Golnud, with an army of 70,000 men, and effected the reduction by the treachery of one of the Rana's officers, who formed the plan of admission of a party of Scindia's troops; these were immediately supported by another party, who attacked an opposite quarter, and got admission also.\n\nGUAM, the largest of the Ladrones islands in the South sea, being about 40 leagues in circumference. It is the only one among the innumerable islands that lie scattered in the immense South sea which has a town built in the European style, with a regular fort, a church, and civilized inhabitants. The air is excellent, the water good, the garden stuffs and fruits are exquisite, the flocks of buffaloes innumerable, as are those of goats and hogs, and all kinds of poultry abound in an astonishing degree. There is no port in which worn-out sailors can be more speedily restored, or find better or more plentiful refreshments, than in this.\n\nBut Guam did not formerly enjoy this state of abundance. When it was first discovered by Magellan in 1521, with the other eight principal islands that lie north of it, which, with a multitude of smaller ones, form together that archipelago known by the name of the Ladrones, they were all crowded with inhabitants, but afforded no refreshments to navigators except fish, bananas, cocoa nuts, and bread fruit; and even these could not be procured but by force, amidst showers of the arrows and lances of the natives. The Spaniards carried thither from America the first stock of cattle, of fowls, of plants, and seeds, and fruits, as well as garden stuffs, which are all now found in such abundance.\n\nThe Ladrones islands, and Guam in particular, were covered with inhabitants when they were discovered. It is said that Guam alone contained upon its coast more than 20,000 people. These men were ferocious savages and bold thieves, as all the islanders in the South seas are, undoubtedly because they were unacquainted with the rights of property; but they were so savage, so incapable of supporting the yoke of civilization, that the Spaniards, who undertook to bring them under the regulations of law and order, have seen their numbers almost annihilated within the space of two centuries. Under the government of their missionaries, these fierce islanders, after having long defended, by cruel wars, the right of living like wild beasts under the guidance of instinct, being at last obliged to yield to the superiority of the Spanish arms, gave themselves up to despair: they took the resolution of administering potions to their women, in order to procure abortions, and to render them sterile, that they might not bring into the world, and leave behind them, beings that were not free, according to the ideas that they had of liberty. A resolution so violent,\nlent, and so contrary to the views and intentions of nature, was persisted in with so much obstinacy in the nine Ladrones islands, that their population, which at the time of the discovery consisted of more than 60,000 souls, does not now exceed 800 or 900 in the whole extent of the archipelago. About 20 or 30 years ago, the scattered fragments of the original natives were collected and established in the island of Guam, where they now begin to recover by the wise precautions, and prudent, though tardy, exertions of a government more adapted to the climate of these islands and to the genius of their inhabitants.\n\nThe principal settlement, which the Spaniards call the town of Agana, is situated about four leagues north-east of the landing-place, on the sea-shore, and at the foot of some hills, not very high, in a beautiful well-watered country. Besides this, there are 21 smaller settlements of Indians round the island, all on the sea-shore, composed of five or six families, who cultivate fruits and grain, and employ themselves in fishing.\n\nThe centre of the island is still uncleared. The trees are not very tall, but they are fit for the building of housetops and of boats. The forests are in general very thick. The Spaniards at first cleared certain portions of land to turn them into savannahs for the feeding of cattle. The formation of savannahs consists in multiplying within the forests small cleared spots separated only by thickets and rows of trees, and kept clean from shrubs of every kind. The Spaniards sow these spots with grass seeds, and other indigenous plants that are fit for pasturage. These meadows, being effectually shaded on every quarter, preserve their freshness, and afford the flocks and herds a shelter from the sun and the great heat of noon. The cattle that were formerly brought to the savannahs of Guam from America have multiplied astonishingly: they are become wild, and must be shot when wanted, or taken by stratagem.\n\nThe woods are likewise full of goats, of hogs, and fowls, which were all originally brought thither by the Spaniards, and are now wild. The flesh of all these animals is excellent. In the savannahs, and even in the heart of the forests, there is a vast multitude of pigeons, of parrots, of thrushes, and of blackbirds.\n\nAmong the indigenous trees of the country, the most remarkable are, the cocoa-nut tree and the bread-fruit tree. The woods are also filled with guavas, bananas, or plantains of many varieties, citrons, lemons, and oranges, both sweet and bitter, and the small dwarf thorny china-orange with red fruit. The caper-bush abounds in all the Ladrones islands; and as it is constantly in flower, as well as the citron and orange shrubs, with many other of the indigenous plants, they perfume the air with the most agreeable smells, and delight the eye with the richest colours.\n\nThe rivers of Guam, which are either rivulets or torrents, abound in fish of an excellent quality: the Indians, however, eat none of them, but prefer the inhabitants of the sea. The turtle, which grow here as large as those in the island of Alcendón, are not eaten either by the Indians or Spaniards.\n\nThe cultivated crops lately introduced are, the rice, the maize, the indigo, the cotton, the cocoa, the sugar-cane, which have all succeeded. That of the Guam maize, especially, is of astonishing fertility: it is common to find in the fields where this grain is cultivated plants of twelve feet high, bearing eight or ten spikes from nine to ten inches in length, set round with well-filled seeds. The gardens are stored with mangoes and pine-apples. The former is one of the finest fruits imaginable: it was brought from Manila, and may be eaten in great quantity without any bad consequences.—Horses have been brought to Guam from Manila, and asses and mules from Acapulco. The Indians have been taught to tame and domesticate the ox, and to employ him in the draught.\n\nThis island, the land of which rises gradually from the sea-shore towards the centre by a gentle acclivity, is not very mountainous. The inhabitants say, that its soil is equally rich and fertile over the whole island, except in the northern part, which forms a peninsula almost destitute of water. But in the rest, you cannot go a league without meeting a rivulet. Upon penetrating a little way into the interior part of the country, to the east and the south of Agana, many springs of fine water are found, forming, at little distances, basins of pure water, which, being shaded by thick trees, preserve a most agreeable coolness in spite of the heat of the climate.\n\nThe indigenous inhabitants, are such as they were described by Magellan; of small stature, sufficiently ugly, black, and in general dirty, though they are continually in the water. The women are for the most part handsome, well made, and of a reddish colour. Both sexes have long hair. This scanty people have become by civilization, gentle, honest, and hospitable. They have, however, at the same time acquired a vice that was unknown to their savage ancestors. The men are a little addicted to drunkennels, for they drink freely of the wine of the cocoa-nut. They love music and dancing much, but labour little. They are passionately fond of cock-fighting. On Sundays and holidays they gather together in crowds after the service, at the door of the church; where each Indian brings his cock to match him with that of his neighbour, and each bets upon his own.—The mission of Guam is now in the hands of the Augustinian friars, who have supplanted the Jesuits.

See Warranty.\n\nGUARANTY, in matters of policy, the engagement of mediatorial or neutral states, whereby they plight their faith that certain treaties shall be inviolably observed, or that they will make war against the aggressor.\n\nGUARD, in a general sense, signifies the defense or preservation of anything; the act of observing what passes, in order to prevent surprise; or the care, precaution, and attention, we make use of to prevent anything from happening contrary to our intentions or inclinations.\n\nGUARD, in the military art, is a duty performed by a body of men, to secure an army or place from being surprised by an enemy. In garrison the guards are relieved every day; hence it comes that every soldier mounts guard once every three or four days in time of peace, and much oftener in time of war. See Honours.\n\nAdvanced Guard, is a party of either horse or foot, that marches before a more considerable body, to give notice of any approaching danger. These guards are either made stronger or weaker, according to situation, the danger to be apprehended from the enemy, or the nature of the country.\n\nVan Guard. See Advanced Guard.\n\nArtillery Guard, is a detachment from the army to secure the artillery when in the field. Their corps de garde is in the front of the artillery park, and their sentries dispersed round the same. This is generally a 48-hours guard; and, upon a march, this guard marches in the front and rear of the artillery, and must be sure to leave nothing behind: if a gun or waggon breaks down, the officer that commands the guard is to leave a sufficient number of men to assist the gunners and matroffs in getting it up again.\n\nArtillery Quarter-Guard, is frequently a non-commissioned officer's guard from the royal regiment of artillery, whose corps de garde is always in the front of their encampment.\n\nArtillery Rear-Guard, consists in a corporal and six men, posted in the rear of the park.\n\nCorps de Garde, are soldiers entrusted with the guard of a post, under the command of one or more officers. This word also signifies the place where the guard mounts.\n\nGrand Guard; three or four squadrons of horse, commanded by a field-officer, posted at about a mile or a mile and a half from the camp, on the right and left wings, towards the enemy, for the better security of the camp.\n\nForage Guard, a detachment sent out to secure the foragers, and who are posted at all places, where either the enemy's party may come to disturb the foragers, or where they may be spread too near the enemy, so as to be in danger of being taken. This guard consists both of horse and foot, and must remain on their posts till the foragers are all come off the ground.\n\nMain Guard, is that from which all other guards are detached. Those who are for mounting guard assemble at their respective captain's quarters, and march from thence to the parade in good order; where, after the whole guard is drawn up, the small guards are detached to their respective posts: then the subalterns throw lots for their guards, who are all under the command of the captain of the main guard. This guard mounts in garrison at different hours, according as the governor pleases.\n\nPiquet Guard, a good number of horse and foot, always in readiness in case of an alarm: the horses are generally saddled all the time, and the riders booted.\n\nThe foot draw up at the head of the battalion, frequently at the beating of the tat-too; but afterwards return to their tents, where they hold themselves in readiness to march upon any sudden alarm. This guard is to make resistance in case of an attack, until the army can get ready.\n\nBaggage Guard, is always an officer's guard, who has the care of the baggage on a march. The waggons should be numbered by companies, and follow one another regularly: vigilance and attention in the passage of hollow ways, woods, and thickets, must be strictly observed by this guard.\n\nQuarter Guard, is a small guard commanded by a subaltern officer, posted in the front of each battalion, at 222 feet before the front of the regiment.\n\nRear Guard, that party of the army which brings up the rear on a march, generally composed of all the old grand guards of the camp. The rear-guard of a part is frequently eight or ten horse, about 500 paces behind the party. Hence the advance-guard going out upon a party, form the rear-guard in their retreat.\n\nRear Guard, is also a corporal's guard placed in the rear of a regiment, to keep good order in that part of the camp.\n\nStandard Guard, a small guard under a corporal, out of each regiment of horse, who mount on foot in the front of each regiment, at the distance of 20 feet from the streets, opposite the main street.\n\nTrench Guard, only mounts in the time of a siege, and sometimes consists of three, four, or five battalions, according to the importance of the siege. This guard must oppose the besieged when they fall out, protect the workmen, &c.\n\nProvost Guard, is always an officer's guard that attends the provost in his rounds, either to prevent defection, marauding, rioting, &c. See Provost.\n\nGuard, in fencing, implies a posture proper to defend the body from the sword of the antagonist.\n\nOrdinary Guards, such as are fixed during the campaign, and relieved daily.\n\nExtraordinary Guards, or detachments, which are only commanded on particular occasions, either for the further security of the camp, to cover the foragers, or for convoys, escorts, or expeditions.\n\nGuards, also imply the troops kept to guard the king's person, and consist both of horse and foot.\n\nHorse Guards, in England, are gentlemen chosen for their bravery, to be entrusted with the guard of the king's person; and were divided into four troops, called the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th troop of horse-guards. The first troop was raised in the year 1665, and the command\ncommand given to Lord Gerard; the second in 1661, and the command given to Sir Philip Howard; the third in 1693, and the command given to Earl Feversham; the fourth in 1702, and the command given to Earl Newburgh. Each troop had one colonel, two lieutenant-colonels, one cornet and major, one guidon and major, four exempts and captains, four brigadiers and lieutenants, one adjutant, four sub-brigadiers and cornets, and 60 private men. But the four troops are now turned into two regiments of life-guards.\n\nHorse-Grenadier Guards, are divided into two troops called the 1st and 2nd troops of horse-grenadier guards. The first troop was raised in 1693, and the command given to Lieutenant-general Cholmondeley; the second in 1702, and the command given to Lord Forbes. Each troop has one colonel, lieutenant-colonel, one guidon or major, three exempts and captains, three lieutenants, one adjutant, three cornets, and 60 private men.\n\nYeomen of the Guard, first raised by Henry VII. in the year 1485. They are a kind of pompous footguards to the king's person; and are generally called by a nickname the Beef-Eaters. They were anciently 250 men of the first rank under gentry; and of larger stature than ordinary, each being required to be six feet high. At present there are but 100 in constant duty, and 70 more not on duty; and when any one of the 100 dies, his place is supplied out of the 70. They go drested after the manner of King Henry VIII.'s time. Their first commander or captain was the earl of Oxford, and their pay is 2s. 6d. per day.\n\nFoot Guards, are regiments of foot appointed for the guard of his majesty and his palace. There are three regiments of them, called the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd regiments of foot-guards. They were raised in the year 1660; and the command of the first given to Colonel Ruffell, that of the second to General Monk, and the third to the earl of Linlithgow. The first regiment is at present commanded by one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, three majors, 23 captains, one captain-lieutenant, 31 lieutenants, and 24 ensigns; and contains three battalions. The second regiment has one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, two majors, 14 captains, one captain-lieutenant, 18 lieutenants, 16 ensigns, and contains only two battalions. The third regiment is the same as the second.\n\nThe French Guards are divided into those within, and those without the palace.—The first are the gardes du corps, or body-guards; which consist of four companies, the first of which companies was anciently Scots. See Scots Guards, infra.\n\nThe guards without are the Gens d'Armes, light horse, musqueteers, and two other regiments, the one of which is French and the other Swiss.\n\nNew arrangements, however, have taken place in this department as well as others since the late revolution.\n\nScots Guards, a celebrated band, which formed the first company of the ancient gardes du corps of France.\n\nIt happened from the ancient intercourse between France and Scotland, that the natives of the latter kingdom had often distinguished themselves in the service of the former. On this foundation the company of Scots guards, and the company of Scots gendarmes, were instituted.—Both of them owed their institution to Charles VII. of France, by whom the first standing army in Europe was formed, anno 1454; and their fates cannot but be interesting to Scotchmen. See Gendarmes.\n\nValour, honour, and fidelity, must have been very conspicuous features of the national character of the Scots, when so great and civilized a people as the French could be induced to choose a body of them, foreigners as they were, for guarding the persons of their sovereigns.—Of the particular occasion and reasons of this predilection we have a recital by Louis XII., a succeeding monarch. After setting forth the services which the Scots had performed for Charles VII. in expelling the English out of France, and reducing the kingdom to his obedience, he adds—\"Since which His Majesty, for reduction, and for the service of the Scots upon that occasion, and for the great loyalty and virtue which he found in them, he selected 200 of them for the guard after the manner of his person, of whom he made an hundred men at quarters, and an hundred life-guards: And the hundred that princes men at arms are the hundred lances of our ancient ordinances; and the life-guard men are those of our guard who still are near and about our person.\"—As to their fidelity in this honourable station, the historian speaking of Scotland says, \"The French have to ancient a friendship and alliance with the Scots, that of 400 men appointed for the king's life-guard, there are an hundred of the said nation who are the nearest to his person, and in the night keep the keys of the apartment where he sleeps. There are, moreover, an hundred complete lances and two hundred yeomen of the said nation, besides several that are dispersed through the companies: And for so long a time as they have served in France, never hath there been one of them found that hath committed or done any fault against the kings or their state; and they make use of them as of their own subjects.\"\n\nThe ancient rights and privileges of the Scottish life-guards were very honourable; especially of the twenty-four first. The author of the Ancient Alliance says, \"On high holidays, at the ceremony of the royal touch, the election of knights of the king's order, the reception of extraordinary ambassadors, and the public entries of cities, there must be six of their number next to the king's person, three on each side; and the body of the king must be carried by these only, wherefoeever ceremony requires. They have the keeping of the keys of the king's lodging at night, the keeping of the chair of the chapel, the keeping the boats where the king passes the rivers; and they have the honour of bearing the white silk fringe in their arms, which in France is the coronation colour. The keys of all the cities where the king makes his entry are given to their captain in waiting or out of waiting.—He has the privilege, in waiting or out of waiting, at ceremonies, such as coronations, marriages, and funerals of the kings, and at the baptism and marriage of their children, to take duty upon him. The coronation robe belongs to him; and this company, by the death or change of a captain, never changes its rank, as do the three others.\"\n\nThis company's first commander, who is recorded as a person of great valour and military accomplishments, was Robert Patilloch, a native of Dundee.\nand the band, ever ardent to distinguish itself, continued in great reputation till the year 1578. From that period, the Scots guards were let's attended to, and their privileges came to be invaded. In the year 1612, they remonstrated to Louis XIII. on the subject of the injustice they had suffered, and set before him the services they had rendered to the crown of France. Attempts were made to re-establish them on their ancient foundation; but no negotiation for this purpose was effectual. The troops of France grew jealous of the honours paid them: the death of Francis II., and the return of Mary to Scotland, at a time when they had much to hope, were unfortunate circumstances to them: the change of religion in Scotland was an additional blow; and the accession of James VI. to the throne of England diminished altogether the interests of France and Scotland. The Scots guards of France had therefore, latterly, no connection with Scotland but the name.\n\n**Guard-Boat**, a boat appointed to row the rounds amongst the ships of war which are laid up in any harbour, &c. to observe that their officers keep a good looking-out, calling to the guard-boat as she passes, and not suffering her crew to come on board, without having previously communicated the watch-word of the night.\n\n**Guard-Ship**, a vessel of war appointed to superintend the marine affairs in a harbour or river, and to see that the ships which are not commissioned have their proper watchword kept duly, by sending her guard-boats around them every night. She is also to receive seamen who are impressed in the time of war.\n\n**Guardian**, in Law, a person who has the charge of any thing; but more commonly it signifies one who has the custody and education of such persons as have not sufficient discretion to take care of themselves and their own affairs, as children and idiots.\n\nTheir business is to take the profits of the minor's lands to his use, and to account for the same: they ought to sell all moveables within a reasonable time, and to convert them into land or money, except the minor is near of age, and may want such things himself; and they are to pay interest for the money in their hands that might have been so placed out; in which case it will be presumed that the guardians made use of it themselves. They are to sustain the lands of the heir, without making destruction of any thing thereon, and to keep it safely for him: if they commit waste on the lands, it is a forfeiture of the guardianship, 3 Edw. I. And where persons, as guardians, hold over any land, without the consent of the person who is next entitled, they shall be adjudged trespassers, and shall be accountable; 6 Ann. cap. xviii.\n\n**Guardian, or Warden, of the Cinque ports**, is an officer who has the jurisdiction of the cinque-ports, with all the power that the admiral of England has in other places.\n\nCamden relates, that the Romans, after they had settled themselves and their empire in our island, appointed a magistrate, or governor, over the east parts where the Cinque-ports lie, with the title of comes littoris Saxonici per Britanniam; having another, who bore the like title, on the opposite side of the sea. Their business was to strengthen the sea coast with munition, against the outrages and robberies of the barbarians; Guardian and that antiquity takes our warden of the Cinque-ports to have been erected in imitation thereof. The wardenship is a place of value, supposed worth 7000l. per annum.\n\n**Guardian of the Spiritualities**, the person to whom the spiritual jurisdiction of any diocese is committed, during the time the see is vacant. A guardian of the spiritualities may likewise be either such in law, as the archbishop is of any diocese within his province; or by delegation, as he whom the archbishop or vicar-general for the time appoints. Any such guardian has power to hold courts, grant licences, dispensations, probates of wills, &c.\n\n**Guarea**, a genus of plants belonging to the octandria clas. See Botany Index.\n\n**Guarini, Battista**, a celebrated Italian poet, born at Ferrara in 1538. He was great-grandson to Guarino of Verona, and was secretary to Alphonso duke of Ferrara, who intrusted him with several important commissions. After the death of that prince, he was successively secretary to Vincenzo de Gonzaga, to Ferdinand de Medicis grand duke of Tuscany, and to Francis Maria de Feltri duke of Urbino. But the only advantages he reaped under these various masters were great encomiums on his wit and compositions. He was well acquainted with polite literature; and acquired immortal reputation by his Italian poems, especially by his *Pafior Fido*, the most known and admired of all his works, and of which there have been innumerable editions and translations. He died in 1612.\n\n**Guardia, or Guarda**, a town of Portugal, in the province of Beira, with a bishop's see. It contains about 2300 inhabitants, is fortified both by art and nature, and has a stately cathedral. W. Long. 6° 37'. N. Lat. 40° 20'.\n\n**Guardia-Alferez**, a town of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, and in the Contado di Molife, with a bishop's see. E. Long. 14° 56'. N. Lat. 41° 39'.\n\n**Guargala, or Guerguela**, a town of Africa, and capital of a small kingdom of the same name, in Biledulgerid, to the south of Mount Atlas. E. Long. 9° 55'. N. Lat. 28° 0'.\n\n**Guariba**, the name of a species of monkey. See Simia, Mammalia Index.\n\n**Guastalla**, a strong town of Italy, in the duchy of Mantua, with the title of a duchy, remarkable for a battle between the French and Imperialists in 1734. It was ceded to the duke of Parma in 1748, by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. It is seated near the river Po, in E. Long. 10° 38'. N. Lat. 44° 55'.\n\n**Guatimala**, the audience and province of, in New Spain, is above 750 miles in length, and 450 in breadth. It is bounded on the west by Soconusco, on the north by Verapax and Honduras, on the east by Nicaragua, and on the south by the South sea. It abounds in chocolate, which they make use of instead of money. It has 12 provinces under it; and the native Americans, under the dominions of Spain, profess Christianity, mixed indeed with many of their own superstitions. There is a great chain of high mountains, which runs across it from east to west, and it is subject to earthquakes and storms. It is, however, very fertile; and produces besides chocolate, great quantities\nGuatemala ties of cochineal and cotton, indigo, woad, balsam, and honey.\n\nGuatemala, St Jago de, is the capital of the above audience, with a bishop's fee, and an university. It carries on a great trade, especially in chocolate. W. Long. 90° 30'. N. Lat. 14° 0'.\n\nSt Jago de Guatemala was almost ruined in 1541, by a storm and an eruption from the volcanic mountain Guatemala. It was afterwards rebuilt at a good distance from this mountain. But in 1773, it was again destroyed by a terrible earthquake. The town then contained 60,000 inhabitants; but no traces of it now remain; 8000 persons perished by this earthquake, and the loss has been estimated at 15 millions sterling.\n\nGUAVA. See Psidium, Botany Index.\n\nGUAXACA, a province in the audience of Mexico, in New Spain, which is very fertile in wheat, Indian corn, cochineal, and caffia. It is bounded by the gulf of Mexico on the north, and by the South Sea on the south. It contains mines of gold and silver. Guaxaca is the capital town.\n\nGUAXACA, the capital town of the above province, with a bishop's fee. It is without walls, and does not contain above 2000 inhabitants; but it is rich, and they make very fine sweet-meats and chocolates. It has several rich convents, both for men and women. W. Long. 100°. N. Lat. 17° 25'.\n\nGUAYRA, a district of the province of La Plata, in South America, having Brazil on the east, and Paraguay on the west.\n\nGUBEN, a handsome town of Germany, in Lower Lusatia, seated on the river Neisse, and belonging to the house of Saxo Mansburg. E. Long. 14° 59'. N. Lat. 51° 55'.\n\nGUBER, a kingdom of Africa, in Negroland. It is surrounded with high mountains; and the villages, which are many, are inhabited by people who are employed in taking care of their cattle and sheep. There are also abundance of artificers, and linen-weavers, who send their commodities to Tombuto. The whole country is overflowed every year by the inundations of the Niger, and at that time the inhabitants sow their rice. There is one town which contains almost 6000 families, among whom are many merchants.\n\nGUBIO, a town of Italy, in the territory of the church, and in the duchy of Urbino, with a bishop's fee. E. Long. 12° 38'. N. Lat. 43° 18'.\n\nGUDGEON, a species of cyprinus. See Cyprinus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nThis fish, though small, is of pleasant taste, that it is very little inferior to smelt. They spawn twice in the summer season; and their feeding is much like the barbels in streams and on gravel, feeding all manner of flies; but they are easily taken with a small red worm, fishing near the ground; and being a leather-mouthed fish, will not easily get off the hook when struck.—The gudgeon may be fished for with float, the hook being on the ground; or by hand, with a running line on the ground, without cork or float. But although the small red worm above-mentioned is the best bait for this fish, yet wafps, gentles, and cadbaits will do very well. You may also fish for gudgeons with two or three hooks at once, and find very pleasant sport, where they rise any thing large. When you angle for them, stir up the sand or gravel with a long pole; this will make them gather to that place, Gudgeon bite faster, and with more eagerness.\n\nSea Gudgeon, Rock-fish, or Black Goby. See Gobius, Guericle.\n\nIchthyology Index.\n\nGUEBRES, or Gabres. See Gabres.\n\nGuelphs, or Guelfs, a celebrated faction in Italy, antagonists of the Gibelins. See Gibelins.\n\nThe Guelphs and Gibelins filled Italy with blood and carnage for many years. The Guelphs stood for the Pope, against the emperor. Their rise is referred by some to the time of Conrad III. in the twelfth century; by others to that of Frederick I.; and by others to that of his successor Frederick II. in the thirteenth century.\n\nThe name of Guelph is commonly said to have been formed from Welf, or Welfo, on the following occasion: the emperor Conrad III., having taken the duchy of Bavaria from Welf VI., brother of Henry duke of Bavaria, Welfe, assisted by the forces of Roger king of Sicily, made war on Conrad, and thus gave birth to the faction of the Guelphs.\n\nOthers derive the name Guelfs from the German Wolff, on account of the grievous evils committed by that cruel faction: others deduce the denomination from that of a German called Guelle, who lived at Pi-floey; adding, that his brother, named Gibel, gave his name to the Gibelins. See the article Gibelins.\n\nGelderland, one of the united provinces, bounded on the west by Utrecht and Holland, on the east by the bishopric of Munster and the duchy of Cleves, on the north by the Zuider Sea and Overijssel, and on the south it is separated from Brabant by the Maes. Its greatest extent from north to south is about 47 miles, and from west to east near as much; but its figure is very irregular. The air here is much healthier and clearer than in the maritime provinces, the land lying higher. Excepting some part of what is called the Veluwe, the soil is fruitful. It is watered by the Rhine, and its three branches, the Wahal, the Yssel, and the Leek, besides lesser streams. In 1079, it was raised to a county by the emperor Henry IV. and in 1339 to a duchy by the emperor Louis of Bavaria. It had dukes of its own till 1528, when it was yielded up to the emperor Charles V. In 1576, it acceded to the union of Utrecht. It is divided into three districts, each of which has its states and diets. Those for the whole province are held twice a-year at the capital towns. The province sends 19 deputies to the states-general. Here are computed 285 Calvinist ministers, 14 Roman Catholic congregations, 4 of the Lutheran persuasion, besides 3 others of Remonstrants and Anabaptists. The places of most note are Nimuegen, Zutphen, Arnhem, Harderwyk, Loo, &c.\n\nGeldres, a strong town of the Netherlands, in the duchy of the same name. It was ceded to the king of Prussia, by the peace of Utrecht, and is seated among marshes. E. Long. 6°. N. Lat. 51° 30'. It surrendered to the French in 1794.\n\nGuercino. See Barberi.\n\nGuericke, Otto or Ortho, a German philosopher of considerable eminence, was born in 1602, and died at Hamburg in 1686. In conjunction with Torricelli, Pafchel, and Boyle, he contributed much to the farther explanation of the properties of air. He was counsellor to the elector of Brandenburg, and burgomaster.\nGuericke, gomaller of Magdeburg, but his greatest celebrity was derived from his philosophical discoveries, in a particular manner the invention of the air-pump. Mr Boyle indeed made approaches towards the discovery of it much about the same time, but with that candour which is ever the characteristic of great and enlightened minds, he confessed that the merit of it belonged exclusively to Guericke, the account of whose experiments first enabled him to bring his design to anything like maturity. Our author has also the merit of inventing the two brass hemispheres, by which the pressure of the air is illustrated, and an instrument for determining the changes in the state of the atmosphere, which fell into disuse on the invention of the barometer. By consulting his tube he predicted approaching storms, on which account he was deemed a sorcerer by the ignorant multitude. It is worthy of observation, that when his brass hemispheres were applied to each other, and the air exhausted, it resisted the efforts of fifteen horses to draw them asunder. He composed several treatises in natural philosophy, the principal of which is entitled *Experimenta Magdeburgica,* 1672, folio, which contains his experiments on a vacuum.\n\nGUERNSEY, an island in the English channel, on the coast of Normandy, subject to Britain; but (as well as the adjacent islands) governed by its own laws. See JERSEY. It extends from east to west in the form of a harp, and is thirteen miles and a half from the south-west to north-east, and twelve and a half, where broadest, from east to west. The air is very healthy, and the soil naturally more rich and fertile than that of Jersey; but the inhabitants neglect the cultivation of the land for the sake of commerce: they are, however, sufficiently supplied with corn and cattle, both for their own use and that of their ships. The island is well fortified by nature with a ridge of rocks, one of which abounds with emery, used by lapidaries in the polishing of stones, and by various other artificers.—Here is a better harbour than any in Jersey, which occasions its being more resorted to by merchants; and on the south side the shore bends in the form of a crescent, enclosing a bay capable of receiving very large ships. The island is full of gardens and orchards; whence cider is so plentiful, that the common people use it instead of small beer, but the more wealthy drink French wine.\n\nGUELTARDA, a genus of plants belonging to the monocota class, and in the natural method ranking under the 38th order, Tricocca. See BOTANY Index.\n\nGUIANA, a large country of South America, is bounded on the east and north by the Atlantic ocean, and the river Oroomoko; on the south, by the river of the Amazons; and on the west, by the provinces of Grenada and New Andalusia, in Terra Firma, from which it is separated both on the west and north by the river Oroomoko. It extends above 1200 miles from the north-east to the south-west, that is, from the mouth of the river Oroomoko to the mouth of the river of the Amazons, and near 600 in the contrary direction.\n\nMost geographers divide it into two parts, calling the country along the coast Caribbeana Proper, and the interior country Guiana Proper: The last is also styled El Dorado by the Spaniards, on account of the immense quantity of gold it is supposed to contain.\n\nThe Portuguese, French, and Dutch, have all settlements along the coast. What lies south of Cape North belongs to the first of these nations; the coast between Cape North and Cape Orange is possessed by the natives; French Guiana, Old Cayenne, or Equinoctial France, extends from Cape Orange, about 240 miles along the coast, to the river Maran; where the Dutch territory begins, and extends to the mouth of the Oroomoko.\n\nAlong the coast, the land is low, marshy, and subject to inundations in the rainy season, from a multitude of rivers which descend from the inland mountains. Hence it is, that the atmosphere is suffocating, hot, moist, and unhealthful, especially where the woods have not been cleared away. Indeed, the Europeans are forced to live in the most disagreeable situations, and fix their colonies at the mouths of the rivers, amidst stinking marshes, and the putrid ooze of salt marshes, for the convenience of exportation and importation.\n\n\"Dutch Guiana (according to the account of a physician who resided several years at Surinam) was first discovered by Columbus in 1498. It lies between the 5° of north and the 5° of south latitude, and between the 53° and 65° of longitude west from London. It is bounded on the north and east, by the Atlantic; on the west, by the rivers Oroomoko and Negroes; and on the south, by the river of the Amazons.\n\n\"It was formerly divided among the Spaniards, Dutch, French, and Portuguese; but, except its sea coast, and lands adjacent to its rivers, it has hitherto remained unknown to all but its original natives; and even of these, it is only what were the Dutch territories that foreigners have any knowledge of; for those of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese, are inaccessible to them.\n\n\"This country, on account of the diversity and fertility of its soil, and of its vicinity to the equator, which passes through it, affords almost all the productions of the different American countries between the tropics, besides a variety peculiar to itself.\"\n\nDutch Guiana was formerly the property of the English, who made settlements at Surinam, where a kind of corrupt English is still spoken by the negroes. The Dutch took it in the reign of Charles the Second; and it was ceded to them by a treaty in 1674, in exchange for what they had possessed in the province now called New York.\n\nThe land for 50 miles up the country from the sea-coast is flat; and, during the rainy seasons, covered two feet high with water. This renders it inconceivably fertile, the earth, for 12 inches deep, being a stratum of perfect manure: an attempt was once made to carry some of it to Barbadoes; but the wood-ants so much injured the vessel, that it was never repeated. The excessive richness of the soil is a disadvantage, for the canes are too luxuriant to make good sugar; and therefore, during the first and second crops, are converted into rum.\n\nThere are some trees on this part; but they are small and low, consisting chiefly of a small species of palm, intermixed with a leaf near 30 feet long and three feet wide, which grows in clumps, called a Troelie, and at the edges of running-water, with mangroves.\nGuiana. Farther inward the country rises; and the soil, though still fertile, is less durable. It is covered with forests of valuable timber, that are always green; and there are some sandy hills, though no mountains; in the French territories, however, there are mountains, according to the report of the Indians, for they have never been visited by any other people.\n\nIn this country the heat is seldom disagreeable: the trade-winds by day, the land breezes in the evening, and the invariable length of the nights, with gentle dews, refresh the air, and render it temperate and salubrious. There are two wet seasons and two dry, of three months each, in every year; and during more than a month in each wet season, the rain is incessant. The dry seasons commence six weeks before the equinoxes, and continue six weeks after. The wet seasons are more wholesome than the dry, because the rains keep the waters that cover the low lands, next the sea, fresh and in motion; but during the dry season it stagnates, and, as it wastes, becomes putrid, sending up very unwholesome exhalations. Blooms, green and ripe fruit, are to be found upon the same tree in every part of the year. There are some fine white and red agates in Guiana, which remain untouched; and mines of gold and silver, which the Dutch will not suffer to be brought.\n\nThe inhabitants of Guiana are either natives, who are of a reddish brown; or negroes and Europeans; or a mixed progeny of these in various combinations. The natives are divided into different tribes, more or less enlightened and polished, as they are more or less remote from the settlements of the Europeans. They allow polygamy, and have no division of lands. The men go to war, hunt, and fish; and the women look after domestic concerns, spin, weave in their fashion, and manage the planting of cassava and manioc, the only things which in this country are cultivated by the natives. Their arms are bows and arrows; sharp poisoned arrows, blown through a reed, which they use in hunting; and clubs made of a heavy wood called iron-wood. They eat the dead bodies of those that are slain in war; and sell for slaves those they take prisoners; their wars being chiefly undertaken to furnish the European plantations. All the different tribes go naked. On particular occasions they wear caps of feathers; but, as cold is wholly unknown, they cover no part but that which distinguishes the sex. They are cheerful, humane, and friendly; but timid, except when heated by liquor, and drunkennels is a very common vice among them.\n\nTheir huts consist of four stakes set up in a quadrangular form, with cross poles, bound together by flit nibbes, and covered with the large leaves called tracelies. Their life is ambulatory; and their house, which is put up and taken down in a few hours, is all they have to carry with them. When they remove from place to place, which, as they inhabit the banks of rivers, they do by water in small canoes, a few vessels of clay made by the women, a flat stone on which they bake their bread, and a rough stone on which they grate the roots of the cassava, a hammock and a hatchet, are all their furniture and utensils; most of them, however, have a bit of looking-glass framed in paper, and a comb.\n\nTheir poisoned arrows are made of splinters of a hard heavy wood, called cacario; they are about 12 inches long, and somewhat thicker than a coarse knitting needle; one end is formed into a sharp point; round the other is wound some cotton, to make it fit the bore of the reed through which it is to be blown. They will blow these arrows 40 yards with absolute certainty of hitting the mark, and with force enough to draw blood, which is certain and immediate death. Against this poison no antidote is known. The Indians never use these poisoned arrows in war, but in hunting only, and chiefly against the monkeys; the flesh of an animal thus killed may be safely eaten, and even the poison itself swallowed with impunity.\n\nGUAYAQUIL, also denominated by some GUAYAQUIL, a city, bay, harbour, and river, in Peru, South America. The city is the second of Spanish origin, being as old as the year 1534. It lies on the west side of the river of the same name, in 1° 11' S. Lat. and 79° 17' W. Long. It is divided into the old and new towns, between which there is a communication by means of a wooden bridge. It is two miles in extent, and defended by two forts. The churches, convents, and houses, are of wood, and it contains about 20,000 inhabitants. The women are celebrated for their personal charms, polite manners, and elegant dress. This place is most of all noted for a shell-fish no larger than a nut, which produces the most beautiful purple dye in the world. It is the blood of the fish, pressed out by a particular process. The commerce here is very considerable, the productions of the country alone forming the greatest part of it, which consist of timber, salt, horned cattle, mules, and colts, pepper, drugs, and a kind of wool, much finer than cotton, made use of for mattresses and beds.\n\nGUIARA, a sea-port town of South America, and on the Caraca coast. The English attempted to take it in 1739 and 1743; but they were repulsed both times. W. Long. 66° 5'. N. Lat. 10° 35'.\n\nGUICCIARDINI, FRANCISCO, a celebrated historian, born at Florence in 1482. He professed the civil law with reputation, and was employed in several embassies. Leo X. gave him the government of Modena and Reggio, and Clement VII. that of Romagna and Bologna. Guicciardini was also lieutenant-general of the pope's army, and distinguished himself by his bravery on several occasions; but Paul III., having taken from him the government of Bologna, he retired to Florence, where he was made counsellor of state, and was of great service to the house of Medici. He at length retired into the country to write his history of Italy, which he composed in Italian, and which comprehends what passed from the year 1494 to 1532. This history is greatly esteemed; and was continued by John Baptist Adriani, his friend. He died in 1540.\n\nGUICCIARDINI, LEWIS, his nephew, composed a history of the Low Countries, and memoirs of the affairs of Europe, from 1530 to 1560. He wrote with great spirit against the persecution of the duke d'Alva, for which he imprisoned him. Died in 1583.\n\nGUIDES, in military language, are usually the country people in the neighbourhood of an encampment; who give the army intelligence concerning the country, the roads by which they are to march, and the probable route of the enemy.\nGUIDI, ALEXANDER, an eminent Italian poet, born at Pavia in 1650. Having a desire to see Rome, he there attracted the notice of Queen Christina of Sweden, who retained him at her court; he also obtained a considerable benefice from Pope Innocent XI. and a pension from the duke of Parma. For a good office he did the state of Milan with Prince Eugene, he was enrolled among the nobles and decurions of that town; and died in 1712. Nature had been kinder to his intellects than to his exterior form; his body was small and crooked, his head was large, and he was blind of his right eye. A collection of his works was published at Verona in 1726.\n\nGUIDO ARETIN. See ARETIN.\n\nGUIDO RENI, an illustrious Italian painter, born at Bologna in 1595. In his early age he was the disciple of Denis Calvert, a Flemish master of good reputation; but afterwards entered himself in the school of the Caracci. He first imitated Ludovico Carracci; but fixed at last in a peculiar style of his own, that secured him the applause of his own time and the admiration of posterity. He was much honoured, and lived in splendor; but an unhappy attachment to gaming ruined his circumstances; the reflection of which brought on a languishing disorder, that put an end to his life in 1642. There are several designs of this great master in print, etched by himself.\n\nGUIDON, a sort of flag or standard borne by the king's life-guard; being broad at one extreme, and almost pointed at the other, and slit or divided into two. The guidon is the ensign or flag of a troop of horse-guards. See GUARD.\n\nGUIDON, also denotes the officer who bears the guidon. The guidon is that in the horse-guards which the ensign is in the foot. The guidon of a troop of horse takes place next below the cornet.\n\nGUIDONS, guidones, or schola guidonum, was a company of priests established by Charlemagne, at Rome, to conduct and guide pilgrims to Jerusalem, to visit the holy places; they were also to assist them in case they fell sick, and to perform the last offices to them in case they died.\n\nGUIENNE, a large province of France, now forming the department of Gironde and that of Lot and Garonne, bounded on the north by Saintonge, Angoumois, and Limousin; on the east by Limosin, Auvergne, and Languedoc; on the south by the Pyrenees, Lower Navarre, and Bearn; and on the west by the ocean. It is about 225 miles in length, and 200 in breadth. It is divided into the Upper and Lower. The Upper comprehends Querci, Rouergue, Armagnac, the territory of Comminges, and the county of Bigorre. The Lower contains Bourdelois, Perigord, Agenois, Condomois, Bazadois, the Lander, Proper Galcony, and the district of Labour. The principal rivers are, the Garonne, the Adour, the Tarn, the Aveyron, and the Lot. Bordeaux is the capital town.\n\nGUILANDINA, the NICKAR TREE, a genus of plants belonging to the decandra clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 33d order, Lomentaceae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nGUILD, (from the Saxon guildane, to \"pay\"), signifies a fraternity or company, because every one was gildare, i.e. to pay something towards the charge and support of the company. As to the original of these guilds or companies: It was a law among the Guild Saxons, that every freeman of fourteen years of age should find sureties to keep the peace, or be committed: upon which certain neighbours, consisting of ten families, enter into an association, and become bound for each other, either to produce him who committed an offence, or to make satisfaction to the injured party: that they might the better do this, they raised a sum of money among themselves, which they put into a common stock; and when one of their pledges had committed an offence, and was fled, then the other nine made satisfaction out of this stock, by payment of money, according to the offence. Because this association consisted of ten families, it was called a decennary: and from hence came out later kings of fraternities. But as to the precise time when these guilds had their origin in England, there is nothing of certainty to be found; since they were in use long before any formal licence was granted to them for such meetings. It seems to have been about the close of the eleventh century, says Anderson, in his History of Commerce, vol. i. p. 70. that merchant-guilds, or fraternities, which were afterwards styled corporations, came first into general use in many parts of Europe. Mr Madox, in his Firma Burgi, chap. i. § 9. thinks, they were hardly known to our Saxon progenitors, and that they might be probably brought into England by the Normans; although they do not seem to have been very numerous in those days. The French and Normans might probably borrow them from the free cities of Italy, where trade and manufactures were much earlier propagated, and where possibly such communities were first in use. These guilds are now companies joined together, with laws and orders made by themselves, by the licence of the prince.\n\nGUILD, in the royal boroughs of Scotland, is still used for a company of merchants, who are freemen of the borough. See BOROUGH.\n\nEvery royal borough has a dean of guild, who is the next magistrate below the bailiff. He judges of controversies among men concerning trade; disputes between inhabitants touching buildings, lights, watercourses, and other nuisances; calls courts, at which his brethren of the guild are bound to attend; manages the common stock of the guild; and amercies and collects fines.\n\nGUILD, Gild, or Geld, is also used among our ancient writers, for a compensation or mulct, for a fault committed.\n\nGUILD-HALL, or Gild-Hall, the great court of judicature for the city of London. In it are kept the mayor's court, the sheriff's court, the court of hustings, court of conscience, court of common council, chamberlain's court, &c. Here also the judges sit upon nisi prius, &c.\n\nGUILDFORD, or GULDEFORD, a borough-town of Surrey, situated on the river Wey, 31 miles south-west of London. Near it are the ruinous walls of an old castle, this having been in the Saxon times a royal villa, where many of our kings used to pass the feastsivals. Here is a corporation consisting of a mayor, recorder, aldermen, &c. which sent members to parliament ever since parliament had a being. The great road from London to Chichester and Portsmouth lies through this town, which has always been famous for good\nGuillemot good inns, the cleanest of linen, and other excellent accommodations; and the affizes are often held here. Its manufactory formerly was cloth, of which there are still some small remains. Here is a school founded by King Edward VI, also an almshouse endowed with lands worth £300 a-year, of which £100 is to be employed in setting the poor at work, and the other £200 for the maintenance of a master, 12 brethren, and 8 sisters, who are to have 2s. 6d. a-week. There are, besides, two charity-schools for 30 boys and 20 girls. There were three churches in this town, but one of them fell down in April 1740. There is a fine circular course for horse-races, which begin when the Newmarket races are ended. King William III founded a plate of 100 guineas to be run for here every May, and used to honour the race with his presence, as did once King George I. The river Wey is made navigable to the town, and by it a great quantity of timber is carried to London, not only from this neighbourhood, but from Sussex and Hampshire woods, above 30 miles off, from whence it is brought hither in the summer by land carriage. This navigation is also of great support to Farnham market, corn bought there being brought to the mills on this river within seven miles distance, and, after being ground and dressed, is sent down in barges to London. The road from hence to Farnham is very remarkable, for it runs along upon the ridge of a high chalky hill, called St Catherine's, no wider than the road itself, from whence there is an extensive prospect, viz. to the north and north-west, over Bagshot Heath, and the other way into Sussex, and almost to the South Downs. The town sends two members to parliament; and gives title of earl to the North family.\n\n**GUILLEMOT.** See COLUMBUS, ORNITHOLOGY\n\n**Index.**\n\n**GULLIM, JOHN,** of Welsh extraction, was born in Herefordshire about the year 1665. Having completed his education at Brazen-nose college, Oxford, he became a member of the college of arms in London; and he was made rouge croix pursuivant, in which post he died in 1621. He published, in 1610, a celebrated work, entitled the Display of Heraldry, folio, which has gone through many editions. To the fifth, which came out in 1679, was added A Treatise of Honour Civil and Military, by Captain John Logan.\n\n**GUILLOTINE,** the name of an instrument introduced by the authors of the French revolution, for beheading those who were condemned to death. The decree for using it passed on the 20th of March 1792, by order of the national assembly. It was not a new invention, properly speaking, but the revival of an instrument known before. It seems to have been first used under the name of maiden, in the barony of Halifax in Yorkshire, and it was likewise set up in Scotland, but we have no good authority for asserting that it was ever used, although some are of opinion that Regent Morton, who brought a model of it from England, suffered by it himself. See MAIDEN.\n\nGuillotine, the supposed inventor, a physician of Lyons, and a member of the national assembly, thought it an honour conferred upon his name, by having it united with this instrument of death. His invention was expensive, and it received the most unqualified applause, both from the members and from the galleries. The propriety of using it was referred to a committee, with instructions to take the opinion of the most able surgeons respecting it. M. Louis, an eminent surgeon of Paris, declared it well fitted for the task, and commended the judgment of M. Guillotine in the contrivance. His discovery upon this occasion was rewarded by the legislature with a donation of 2000 livres; and it was ordered to be printed in the Paris Journals.\n\nAs far as this instrument diminishes the duration of the dreadful conflict with death, it may be deemed merciful, and is, in this respect, preferable to the hanging of malefactors by the neck; but the agitation of the mind is probably augmented by the long series of preparatory operations. The hands of the criminal are tied behind his back; he is stretched on his face on a strong plank. He is then fastened to the plank, his neck is adjusted to the block, and a basket placed before him to receive his head, which in the speediest manner must take up some time, although we recollect to have read of 21 (viz. Briffot and his party) who were all decapitated in the course of 36 minutes.\n\nThe construction of the guillotine has been variously modified, and was at length made so portable as to constitute part of the travelling equipage of a commissioner from the national assembly; and a representation of it was put upon the coins, as an ornament. On a piece of ten sous value, which was struck at Mentz in the year 1793, there was for the device, the fasces and axe of ancient Rome, crowned with a red cap, and surrounded by a laurel wreath, having for an inscription, *Republique Françoise, 1793,* (an 2).\n\n**GUINEA,** a large tract of country lying on the west side of the continent of Africa, extends along the coast three or four thousand miles, beginning at the river Senegal, situated about the 17th degree of north latitude (being the nearest part of Guinea as well to Europe as to North America). From that river to the river Gambia, and in a southerly course to Cape Sierra Leon, is comprehended a coast of about 700 miles; being the same tract for which Queen Elizabeth granted charters to the first traders to that coast. From Sierra Leon, the land of Guinea takes a turn to the eastward, extending that course about 1500 miles, including those several divisions known by the names of the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast, with the large kingdom of Benin. From thence the land runs southward along the coast about 1200 miles, which contains the kingdoms of Congo and Angola; where the trade for slaves ends. From which to the southernmost cape of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, the country is settled by Cafrres and Hottentots, who have never been concerned in the making or selling slaves.\n\n1. Of the parts which are above mentioned, the first is that situated on the great river Senegal, which is said to be navigable more than 1000 miles, and is by travellers described to be very agreeable and fruitful. Mr Brue, principal factor for the French African company, who lived 16 years in that country, after describing its fruitfulness and plenty near the sea, adds*, \"The farther you go from the sea, the country on the river seems the more fruitful and well improved, abounding with Indian corn, pulse, fruit, &c. Here are vast meadows, which feed large herds of great and small cattle, and poultry numerous: the villages that lie thick on the river, show the country...\"\nGuinea. is well peopled.\" The same author, in the account of a voyage he made up the river Gambia, the mouth of which lies about 300 miles south of the Senegal, and is navigable about 600 miles up the country, says, \"that he was surprized to see the land so well cultivated; scarce a spot lay unimproved; the low lands divided by small canals were all sowed with rice, &c., the higher ground planted with millet, Indian corn, and peas of different sorts; their beef excellent; poultry plenty and very cheap, as well as all other necessaries of life.\" Mr Moore, who was sent from England about the year 1735, in the service of the African company, and resided at James Fort on the river Gambia, or in other factories on that river, about five years, confirms the above account of the fruitfulness of the country. Captain Smith, who was sent in the year 1726 by the African company to survey their settlements throughout the whole coast of Guinea, says*, \"the country about the Gambia is pleasant and fruitful; provisions of all kinds being plenty and exceeding cheap.\" The country on and between the two above-mentioned rivers is large and extensive, inhabited principally by those three Negro nations known by the name of Jalofs, Fulis, and Mandingos. The Jalof's possess the middle of the country. The Fulis principal settlement is on both sides of the Senegal: great numbers of these people are also mixed with the Mandingos; which last, are mostly settled on both sides the Gambia. The government of the Jalofs is represented as under a better regulation than can be expected from the common opinion we entertain of the negroes. We are told in Aflley's Collection, \"That the king has under him several ministers of state, who assist him in the exercise of justice. The grand jefro is the chief justice through all the king's dominions, and goes in circuit from time to time to hear complaints and determine controversies. The king's treasurer exercises the same employment, and has under him alkairs, who are governors of towns or villages. That the kondi, or viceroy, goes the circuit with the chief justice, both to hear causes and inspect into the behaviour of the alkadi, or chief magistrate of every village in their several districts.\" Vafconcelas, an author mentioned in the Collection, says, \"the ancientest are preferred to be the prince's counsellors, who keep always about his person; and the men of most judgment and experience are the judges.\" The Fulis are settled on both sides of the river Senegal: their country, which is very fruitful and populous, extends near 400 miles from east to west. They are generally of a deep tawny complexion, appearing to bear some affinity to the Moors, whose country they join on the north: they are good farmers, and make great harvest of corn, cotton, tobacco, &c., and breed great numbers of cattle of all kinds. But the most particular account we have of these people is from Moore, who says†, \"Some of these Ful blacks, who dwell on both sides the river Gambia, are in subjection to the Mandingos, amongst whom they dwell, having been probably driven out of their country by war or famine. They have chiefs of their own, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink brandy, or anything stronger than water and sugar, being strict Mahometans. Their form of government goes on easy, because the people are of a good quiet disposition, and so well instructed in what is right, that a man who does ill is the abomination of all, and none will support him against the chief. In these countries the natives are not covetous of land, desiring no more than what they use; and as they do not plough with horses and cattle, they can use but very little; therefore the kings are willing to give the Fulis leave to live in their country, and cultivate their lands. If any of their people are known to be made slaves, all the Fulis will join to redeem them; they also support the old, the blind, and lame, amongst themselves; and as far as their abilities go, they supply the necessities of the Mandingos, great numbers of whom they have maintained in famine.\" The author, from his own observations, says, \"They were rarely angry, and that he never heard them abuse one another.\"\n\nThe Mandingos are said by Mr Brue before mentioned, \"to be the most numerous nation on the Gambia, besides which, numbers of them are dispersed over all these countries; being the most rigid Mahometans amongst the negroes, they drink neither wine nor brandy, and are politer than the other negroes. The chief of the trade goes through their hands. Many are industrious and laborious, keeping their grounds well cultivated, and breeding a good stock of cattle †. Every town has an alkadi, or governor, ‡ who has great power; for most of them having two Collectors, common fields of clear ground, one for corn, and the other for rice, the alkadi appoints the labour of all the people. The men work the corn ground, and the women and girls the rice ground; and as they all equally labour, so he equally divides the corn amongst them; and in case any are in want, the others supply them. This alkadi decides all quarrels, and has the first voice in all confidences in town affairs.\" Some of the Mandingos, who are settled at Galem, far up the river Senegal, can read and write Arabic tolerably; and are a good hospitable people, who carry on a trade with the inland nations. \"They are extremely populous in those parts, their women being fruitful, and they not suffering any person amongst them, but such as are guilty of crimes, to be made slaves.\" We are told from Joblon, \"That the Mahometan Negroes say their prayers thrice a day. Each village has a priest who calls them to their duty. It is surprising (says the author), as well as commendable, to see the modesty, attention, and reverence they observe during their worship. He asked some of their priests the purport of their prayers and ceremonies; their answer always was, \"that they adored God by prostrating themselves before him; that by humbling themselves they acknowledged their own insignificance, and farther intreated him to forgive their faults, and to grant them all good and necessary things, as well as deliverance from evil.\" Joblon takes notice of several good qualities in these negro priests, particularly their great sobriety. They gain their livelihood by keeping school for the education of the children. The boys are taught to read and write. They not only teach school, but rove about the country, teaching and instructing, for which the whole country is open to them; and they have a free course through all places, though the kings may be at war with one another.\n\nThe three fore-mentioned nations practice several trades,\nGuinea trades, as smiths, potters, saddlers, and weavers. Their smiths work particularly neat in gold and silver, and make knives, hatchets, reaping hooks, spades, and hammers to cut iron, &c. Their potters make neat tobacco pipes, and pots to boil their food. Some authors say, that weaving is their principal trade; this is done by the women and girls, who spin and weave very fine cotton cloth, which they dye blue or black. Moore says, the Jalofs particularly make great quantities of the cotton cloth; their pieces are generally 27 yards long, and about nine inches broad, their looms being very narrow; these they sew neatly together, so as to supply the use of broad cloth.\n\nIt was in these parts of Guinea that M. Adanson, correspondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, was employed from the year 1749 to the year 1753, wholly in making natural and philosophical observations on the country about the rivers Senegal and Gambia. Speaking of the great heats in Senegal, he says*, \"it is to them that they are partly indebted for the fertility of their lands; which is so great, that, with little labour and care, there is no fruit nor grain but grows in great plenty.\"\n\nOf the soil on the Gambia, he says, \"it is rich and deep, and amazingly fertile; it produces spontaneously, and almost without cultivation, all the necessaries of life, grain, fruit, herbs, and roots. Everything matures to perfection, and is excellent in its kind.\" One thing which always surprised him, was the prodigious rapidity with which the sap of trees repairs any loss they may happen to sustain in that country; \"And I was never (says he) more astonished, than when landing four days after the locusts had devoured all the fruits and leaves, and even the buds of the trees, to find the trees covered with new leaves, and they did not seem to me to have suffered much.\" \"It was then (says the same author) the fish season; you might see them in shoals approaching towards land. Some of these shoals were 50 fathoms square, and the fish crowded together in such a manner, as to roll upon one another, without being able to swim. As soon as the negroes perceive them coming towards land, they jump into the water with a basket in one hand, and swim with the other. They need only to plunge and to lift up their basket, and they are sure to return loaded with fish.\" Speaking of the appearance of the country, and of the disposition of the people, he says, \"which waysoever I turned mine eyes on this pleasant spot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature; an agreeable solitude, bounded on every side by charming landscapes; the rural situation of cottages in the midst of trees; the ease and indolence of the negroes, reclined under the shade of their spreading foliage; the simplicity of their dress and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our first parents, and I seemed to contemplate the world in its primitive state. They are, generally speaking, very good-natured, sociable, and obliging. I was not a little pleased with this my first reception; it convinced me, that there ought to be a considerable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard everywhere of the savage character of the Africans. I observed, both in the negroes and Moors great humanity and sociability, which gave me strong hopes that I should be very safe amongst them, and meet with the success I desired in my inquiries after the curiosities of the country.\" He was agreeably amused with the conversation of the negroes, their fables, dialogues, and witty stories with which they entertain each other alternately, according to their custom. Speaking of the remarks which the natives made to him with relation to the stars and planets, he says, \"it is amazing that such a rude and illiterate people should reason so pertinently in regard to those heavenly bodies; there is no manner of doubt, but that with proper instruments, and a good will, they would become excellent astronomers.\"\n\n2. That part of Guinea known by the name of the Grain and Ivory Coast extends about 500 miles. The soil is said to be in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots; indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation, and tobacco would be excellent if carefully manufactured; they have fish in plenty; their flocks greatly increase; and their trees are loaded with fruit. They make a cotton cloth, which sells well on the coast. In a word, the country is rich, and the commerce advantageous, and might be greatly augmented by such as would cultivate the friendship of the natives. These are represented by some writers as a rude, treacherous people; whilst several other authors of credit give them a very different character, describing them as sensible, courteous, and the fairest traders on the coast of Guinea. In the Collection, they are said to be averse to drinking to excess, and such as do so are severely punished by the king's order. On inquiry why there is such a disagreement in the character given of these people, it appears, that though they are naturally inclined to be kind to strangers, with whom they are fond of trading, yet the frequent injuries done them by Europeans have occasioned their being suspicious and shy: the same cause has been the occasion of the ill treatment they have sometimes given to innocent strangers, who have attempted to trade with them. As the Europeans have no settlement on this part of Guinea, the trade is carried on by signals from the ships, on the appearance of which the natives usually come on board in their canoes, bringing their gold-dust, ivory, &c., which has given opportunity to some villainous Europeans to carry them off with their effects, or retain them on board till a ransom is paid. It is noted by some, that since the European voyagers have carried away several of these people, their mistrust is so great, that it is very difficult to prevail on them to come on board. Smith remarks, \"As we passed along this coast, we very often lay before a town, and fired a gun for the natives to come off; but no foul came near us: at length we learnt by some ships that were trading down the coast, that the natives came seldom on board an English ship, for fear of being detained or carried off: yet at last some ventured on board; but if these chanced to spy any arms, they would all immediately take to their canoes, and make the best of their way home. They had then in their possession one Benjamin Crofts, the mate of an English vessel, who was detained by them to make reprisals for some of their men, who had formerly been carried away by some English vessel.\" In the Collection we are told, \"This villainous custom is too often practised, chiefly by the Bristol and Liverpool ships, and is a great detriment to the slave-trade on the windward coast.\" John Snock, mentioned in Boftan, p. 440, when\nwhen on the coast, wrote, \"We cast anchor, but not one negro coming on board, I went on shore; and after having tarried a while on the strand, some negroes came to me; and being desirous to be informed why they did not come on board, I was answered, that about two months before, the English had been there with two large vessels, and had ravaged the country, destroyed all their canoes, plundered their houses, and carried off some of their people, upon which the remainder fled to the inland country, where most of them were at that time; so that there being not much to be done by us, we were obliged to return on board. When I inquired after their wars with other countries, they told me they were not often troubled with them; but if any difference happened, they chose rather to end the dispute amicably than to come to arms.\" He found the inhabitants civil and good-natured. Speaking of the king of Rio Seifre, lower down the coast, he says, \"He was a very agreeable, obliging man; and all his subjects are civil, as well as very laborious in agriculture and the pursuits of trade.\" Marquis says, \"That though the country is very populous, yet none of the natives (except criminals) are sold for slaves.\" Vaillant never heard of any settlement being made by the Europeans on this part of Guinea; and Smith remarks, \"That these coasts, which are divided into several little kingdoms, and have seldom any wars, is the reason the slave-trade is not so good here as on the Gold and Slave Coasts, where the Europeans have several forts and factories.\" A plain evidence this, that it is the intercourse with the Europeans, and their settlements on the coast, which gives life to the slave-trade.\n\n3. Next adjoining to the Ivory Coast are those called the Gold Coast and the Slave Coast; authors are not agreed about their bounds, but their extent together along the coast may be about 500 miles. And as the policy, produce, and economy of these two kingdoms of Guinea are much the same, they shall be described together.\n\nHere the Europeans have the greatest number of forts and factories; from whence, by means of the negro factors, a trade is carried on above 700 miles back in the inland country; whereby great numbers of slaves are procured, as well by means of the wars which arise amongst the negroes, or are fomented by the Europeans, as those brought from the back country. Here we find the natives more reconciled to the European manners and trade; but, at the same time, much more inured to war, and ready to assist the European traders in procuring loadings for the great number of vessels which come yearly on those coasts for slaves. This part of Guinea is agreed by historians to be, in general, extraordinary fruitful and agreeable; producing (according to the difference of the soil) vast quantities of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm wine and oil, and fish in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. Bofman, principal factor for the Dutch at D'Elmina, speaking of the country of Axim, which is situated towards the beginning of the Gold coast, says, \"The negro inhabitants are generally very rich, driving a great trade with the Europeans for gold: That they are industriously employed either in trade, fishing, or agriculture; but chiefly in the culture of rice, which grows here in an incredible abundance, and is transported hence Guinea, all over the Gold coast: the inhabitants, in lieu, returning full fraught with millet, jams, potatoes, and palm oil.\" The same author, speaking of the country of Ante, says, \"This country, as well as the Gold coast, abounds with hills, enriched with extraordinary high and beautiful trees; its valleys, betwixt the hills, are wide and extensive, producing in great abundance very good rice, millet, jams, potatoes, and other fruits, all good in their kind.\" He adds, \"In short, it is a land that yields its manurers as plentiful a crop as they can wish, with great quantities of palm wine and oil, besides being well furnished with all sorts of tame as well as wild beasts; but that the last fatal wars had reduced it to a miserable condition, and stripped it of most of its inhabitants.\" The adjoining country of Fetu, he says, \"was formerly so powerful and populous, that it struck terror into all the neighbouring nations; but it is at present so drained by continual wars, that it is entirely ruined; there does not remain inhabitants sufficient to till the country, though it is so fruitful and pleasant that it may be compared to the country of Ante just before described; frequently (says our author), when walking through it before the last war, I have seen it abound with fine well built and populous towns, agreeably enriched with vast quantities of corn, cattle, palm wine, and oil. The inhabitants all apply themselves without any distinction to agriculture; some sow corn; others press oil, and draw wine from palm trees, with both which it is plentifully stored.\"\n\nSmith gives much the same account of the before-mentioned parts of the Gold coast; and adds, \"the country about D'Elmina and Cape Coast is much the same for beauty and goodness, but more populous; and the nearer we come towards the Slave coast, the more delightful and rich all the countries are, producing all sorts of trees, fruits, roots, and herbs, that grow within the torrid zone.\" Barbot also remarks, with respect to the countries of Ante and Adom, \"That the Description of Guinea is very good and fruitful in corn and other produce; which it affords in such plenty, that besides what serves for their own use, they always export great quantities for sale; they have a competent number of cattle, both tame and wild, and the rivers are abundantly stored with fish; so that nothing is wanting for the support of life, and to make it easy.\" In the Collection it is said, \"That the inland people on that part of the coast employ themselves in tillage and trade, and supply the market with corn, fruit, and palm wine; the country producing such vast plenty of Indian corn, that abundance is daily exported as well by Europeans as blacks resorting thither from other parts.\" These inland people are said to live in great union and friendship, being generally well tempered, civil, and tractable; not apt to shed human blood, except when much provoked; and ready to assist one another. In the Collection it is said, \"That the fishing business is effected on the Gold Coast next to trading; that those who profess it are more numerous than those of other employments. That the greatest number of these are at Kommendo, Mina, and Korantin; from each of which places there go out every morning (Tuesday excepted, which is the Fetish day or day of rest), five, six, and sometimes eight hundred canoes,\"\nGuinea canoes, from 13 to 14 feet long, which spread themselves two leagues at sea, each fisherman carrying in his canoe a sword, with bread, water, and a little fire on a large stone to roast fish. Thus they labour till noon, when the sea breeze blowing fresh, they return on the shore, generally laden with fish; a quantity of which the inland inhabitants come down to buy, which they sell again at the country markets.\"\n\nSmith says, \"The country about Accra, where the English and Dutch have each a strong fort, is very delightful, and the natives courteous and civil to strangers.\" He adds, \"That this place seldom fails of an extraordinary good trade from the inland country, especially for slaves, whereof several are supposed to come from very remote parts, because it is not uncommon to find a Malayan or two amongst a parcel of other slaves: The Malay people are generally natives of Malacca, in the East Indies, situated several thousand miles from the Gold Coast.\" They differ very much from the Guinea negroes, being of a tawny complexion, with long black hair.\n\nMost parts of the Slave coast are represented as equally fertile and pleasant with the Gold coast. The kingdom of Whidah has been particularly noted by travellers. Smith and Bofman agree, \"That it is one of the most delightful countries in the world. The great number and variety of tall, beautiful, and shady trees, which seem planted in groves; the verdant fields everywhere cultivated, and no otherwise divided than by those groves, and in some places a small foot-path, together with a great number of villages, contribute to afford the most delightful prospect; the whole country being a fine, easy, and almost imperceptible ascent for the space of 40 or 50 miles from the sea. That the farther you go from the sea, the more beautiful and populous the country appears. That the natives were kind and obliging, and so industrious, that no place which was thought fertile could escape being planted, even within the hedges which inclose their villages. And that the next day after they had reaped, they sowed again.\"\n\nSnelgrave also says, \"The country appears full of towns and villages; and being a rich soil, and well cultivated, looks like an entire garden.\" In the Collection, the husbandry of the negroes is described to be carried on with great regularity. \"The rainy season approaching, they go into the fields and woods, to fix on a proper place for sowing; and as here is no property in ground, the king's licence being obtained, the people go out in troops, and first clear the ground from bushes and weeds, which they burn. The field thus cleared, they dig it up a foot deep, and so let it remain for eight or ten days, till the rest of their neighbours have disposed their ground in the same manner. They then consult about sowing, and for that end assemble at the king's court the next Friday. The king's grain must be sown first. They then go again to the field, and give the ground a second digging, and sow their seed. Whilst \"the king or governor's land is sowing, he feeds out wine and flesh, ready dressed, enough to serve the labourers. Afterwards, they in like manner sow the ground allotted for their neighbours as diligently as that of the king's, by whom they are also fed; and so continue to work in a body for the public benefit till every man's ground is tilled and sowed. None but the king, and a few great men, are exempted from this labour. Their grain soon sprouts out of the ground. When it is about a man's height, and begins to ear, they raise a wooden house in the centre of the field, covered with straw, in which they set their children to watch their corn, and fright away the birds.\"\n\nBofman speaks in commendation of the civility, kindness, and great industry of the natives of Whidah. This is confirmed by Smith, who says \"The natives here seem to be the most gentleman-like negroes in Guinea, abounding with good manners and ceremony to each other. The inferior pay the utmost deference and respect to the superior, as do wives to their husbands, and children to their parents. All here are naturally industrious, and find constant employment; the men in agriculture, and the women in spinning and weaving cotton. The men, whose chief talent lies in husbandry, are unacquainted with arms; otherwise, being a numerous people, they could have made a better defence against the king of Dahomy, who subdued them without much trouble.\" According to the Collection, there are, throughout the Gold coast, regular markets in all villages, furnished with provisions and merchandise, held every day in the week except Tuesday, whence they supply, not only the inhabitants, but the European ships. The negro women are very expert in buying and selling, and extremely industrious; for they will repair daily to market from a considerable distance, loaded like pack-horses, with a child perhaps at their back, and a heavy burden on their heads. After selling their wares, they buy fish and other necessaries, and return home loaded as they came. There is a market held at Sabi every fourth day, also a weekly one in the province of Apologua, which is so resorted to, that there are usually 5000 or 6000 merchants. Their markets are so well regulated and governed, that seldom any disorder happens; each species of merchandise and merchants have a separate place allotted them by themselves. The buyers may haggle as much as they will, but it must be without noise or fraud. To keep order, the king appoints a judge; who, with four officers well armed, inspects the markets, hears all complaints, and in a summary way decides all differences; he has power to seize, and sell as slaves, all who are caught in stealing or disturbing the peace. In these markets are to be sold men, women, children, oxen, sheep, goats, and fowls of all kinds; European cloths, linen and woollen; printed calicoes, silk, grocery ware, china, gold-dull, iron in bars, &c. in a word, most sorts of European goods, as well as the produce of Africa and Asia. They have other markets, resembling our fairs, once or twice a-year, to which all the country repair; for they take care to order the day so in different governments as not to interfere with each other.\"\n\nWith respect to government, Smith says *, \"that *Smith, the Gold coast and Slave coast are divided into different districts, some of which are governed by their chiefs or kings: the others, being more of the nature of a commonwealth, are governed by some of the principal men, called Caboceros; who, Bofman says, are properly denominated civil fathers, whole province,\"\nGuinea. vince is to take care of the welfare of the city or village, and to appease tumults.\" But this order of government has been much broken since the coming of the Europeans. Both Bofman and Barbot mention murder and adultery to be severely punished on the coast, frequently by death; and robbery by a fine proportionable to the goods stolen.\n\nThe income of some of the kings is large. Bofman says, \"that the king of Whidah's revenues and duties on things bought and sold are considerable; he having the title of all things sold in the market, or imported into the country.\" Both the above-mentioned authors say, the tax on slaves shipped off in this king's dominions, in some years, amounts to near 20,000l.\n\nBofman tells us, \"the Whidah negroes have a faint idea of a true God, ascribing to him the attributes of almighty power and omnipresence; but God, they say, is too high to condescend to think of mankind; wherefore he commits the government of the world to those inferior deities which they worship.\" Some authors say, the wisest of these negroes are sensible of their mistake in this opinion; but dare not forsake their own religion, for fear of the populace rising and killing them. This is confirmed by Smith, who says, \"that all the natives of this coast believe there is one true God, the author of them and all things; that they have some apprehension of a future state; and that almost every village has a grove, or public place of worship, to which the principal inhabitants, on a set day, resort to make their offerings.\"\n\nIn the Collection it is remarked as an excellency in the Guinea government, \"that however poor they may be in general, yet there are no beggars to be found amongst them; which is owing to the care of their chief men, whose province it is to take care of the welfare of the city or village, it being part of their office to see that such people may earn their bread by their labour; some are set to blow the smith's bellows, others to press palm oil, or grind colours for their mats, and sell provision in the markets. The young men are fitted to serve as soldiers, so that they suffer no common beggar.\" Bofman affirms a further reason for this good order, viz., \"that when a negro finds he cannot subsist, he binds himself for a certain sum of money, and the master to whom he is bound is obliged to find him necessaries; that the master sets him a sort of task, which is not in the least flattery, being chiefly to defend his master on occasions, or in owing time to work as much as himself pleases.\"\n\nAdjoining to the kingdom of Whidah are several small governments, as Coto, great and small Popo, Ardrah, &c., all situated on the Slave coast, where the chief trade for slaves is carried on. These are governed by their respective kings, and follow much the same customs with those of Whidah, except that their principal living is on plunder and the slave-trade.\n\n4. Next adjoining to the Slave Coast, is the kingdom of Benin, which, though it extends but about 170 miles on the sea, yet spreads far inland as to be esteemed the most potent kingdom in Guinea. By accounts, the soil and produce appear to be in a great measure like those before described, and the natives are represented as a reasonable good-natured people. Artua says, \"they are a sincere, inoffensive people, and do no injustice either to one another or to strangers.\" Smith confirms this account, and says, \"that the inhabitants are generally very good-natured, and exceeding courteous and civil. When the Europeans make them presents, which in their coming thither to trade they always do, they endeavour to return them doubly.\" Bofman tells us, \"that his countrymen the Dutch, who were often obliged to trust them till they returned the next year, were sure to be honestly paid their whole debts.\"\n\nThere is in Benin a considerable order in government; theft, murder, and adultery, being severely punished. Smith says, \"their towns are governed by officers appointed by the king, who have power to decide in civil cases, and to raise the public taxes; but in criminal cases, they must send to the king's court, which is held at the town of Oedo or Great Benin. This town, which covers a large extent of ground, is about 60 miles from the sea.\" Barbot tells us, \"that it contains 30 streets, 20 fathoms wide, and almost two miles long, commonly extending in a straight line from one gate to another; that the gates are guarded by foldiers; that in these streets markets are held every day, for cattle, ivory, cotton, and many sorts of European goods. This large town is divided into several wards or districts, each governed by its respective king of a street, as they call them, to administer justice, and to keep good order. The inhabitants are very civil and good-natured, condescending to what the Europeans require of them in a civil way.\" The same author confirms what has been said by others of their justice in the payment of their debts; and adds, \"that they, above all other Guineans, are very honest and just in their dealings; and they have such an aversion for theft, that by the law of the country it is punished with death.\" We are told by the same author, \"that the king of Benin is able upon occasion to maintain an army of 100,000 men; but that, for the most part, he does not keep 30,000. See the article Benin.\n\n5. The last division of Guinea from which slaves are imported, are the kingdoms of Congo and Angola; these lie to the south of Benin, extending with the intermediate land about 1200 miles on the coast. Great numbers of the natives of both these kingdoms profess the Christian religion, which was long since introduced by the Portuguese, who made early settlements in that country. See Congo and Angola.\n\nIn the Collection it is said, that both in Congo and Angola, the soil is in general fruitful, producing great plenty of grain, Indian corn, and such quantities of rice, that it hardly bears any price, with fruits, roots, and palm oil in plenty. The natives are generally a quiet people, who discover a good understanding, and behave in a friendly manner to strangers, being of a mild conversation, affable, and easily overcome with reason. In the government of Congo, the king appoints a judge in every particular division, to hear and determine disputes and civil causes; the judges imprison and release, or impose fines, according to the rule of custom; but in weighty matters, every one may appeal to the king, before whom all criminal causes are brought, in which he gives sentence; but seldom condemns to death. The town of Leango stands in the midst of four lordships, which abound in corn,\nHere they make great quantities of cloth of divers kinds, very fine and curious; the inhabitants are seldom idle; they even make needle-work caps as they walk in the streets. The slave-trade is here principally managed by the Portuguese, who carry it far up into the inland countries. They are said to send off from these parts 15,000 slaves each year. At Angola, about the 10th degree of south latitude, ends the trade for slaves.\n\nAs all these countries lie between the tropics, the air is excessively hot, especially from the beginning of September to the end of March; which, with the coolness of the nights, the frequent thick, flanking, fulphureous mists, and the periodical rains, when the flat country is overflowed, makes it very unhealthy, especially to Europeans. The natives, however, are little affected with the unwholesome air. According to Barbot, they keep much within doors in tempestuous times; and when exposed to the weather, their skins being suppled and pores closed by daily anointing with palm oil, the weather can make but little impression on them. They generally, therefore, enjoy a good state of health, and are able to procure to themselves a comfortable subsistence, with much less care and toil than is necessary in our more northern climate; which last advantage arises not only from the warmth of the climate, but also from the overflowing of the rivers, whereby the land is regularly moistened and rendered extremely fertile; and being in many places improved by culture, abounds with grain and fruits, cattle, poultry, &c. The earth yields all the year a fresh supply of food: Few clothes are requisite, and little art necessary in making them, or in the construction of their houses, which are very simple, principally calculated to defend them from the tempestuous fogs and wild beasts; a few dry reeds covered with mats serve for their beds. The other furniture, except what belongs to cookery, gives the women but little trouble; the moveables of the greatest among them amounting only to a few earthen pots, some wooden utensils, and gourds or calabashes; from these last, which grow almost naturally over their huts, to which they afford an agreeable shade, they are abundantly stocked with good clean vessels for most household uses, being of different sizes, from half a pint to several gallons.\n\nThe distempers the Europeans are subject to on this coast, are fevers, fluxes, and colics, which are occasioned by indifferent water and bad air; their settlements lying near the coast, where the fogs and steams arising from the ooze and salt-marshes, and the flanking fish the natives dry on the beach, corrupt the air, and render it fatal to foreigners. The most temperate men find it difficult to preserve their health; but a great many hasten their death by their intemperance, or negligence, exposing themselves to the cold air in the evening, after a very hot day. This sudden change, from one extreme to the other, has often very bad effects in hot climates.\n\nOf mountains in Guinea, the most remarkable are those of Sierra Leon. The principal capes are those of Cape Blanco, Cape Verd, Cape Leon, Cape St Ann's, Cape Palmas, and Cape Three Points, Cape Formosa, Cape Monte, Cape St John, Cape Lopas, Cape Lede, and Cape Negro. The chief bays are the Cyprian or Cintra bay, and the Bite of Guinea. Of the rivers, the most considerable are those of Conanza and Ambrija, the Zara, the Lunde, the Cameroon, the Formosa, the Volta, the Sierra Leon, and the Sherbro. All these run from east to west (except the Volta, which runs from north to south), and fall into the Atlantic.\n\nBesides gold, ivory, and slaves, Guinea affords indigo, wax, gum-lengea, gum-tragacanth, and a variety of other gums and drugs.\n\nThe most ancient account we have of the country of the negroes, particularly that part situated on the Guinea trade, is from the writings of two ancient authors, one an Arabian, and the other a Moor. The first wrote in Arabic about the 12th century. His works, printed in that language at Rome, were afterwards translated into Latin, and printed at Paris under the patronage of the famous Thuanus chancellor of France, with the title of Geographia Nubienfis, containing an account of all the nations lying on the Senegal and Gambia. The other was written by John Leo, a Moor, born at Granada in Spain, before the Moors were totally expelled from that kingdom. He resided in Africa; but being on a voyage from Tripoli to Tunis, was taken by some Italian corsairs, who finding him possessed of several Arabian books, besides his own manuscripts, apprehended him to be a man of learning, and as such presented him to Pope Leo X. This pope encouraging him, he embraced the Roman religion, and his description of Africa was published in Italian. From these writings we gather, that after the Mahometan religion had extended to the kingdom of Morocco, some of the promoters of it crossing the sandy deserts of Numidia, which separate that country from Guinea, found it inhabited by men, who, though under no regular government, and destitute of that knowledge the Arabs were favoured with, lived in content and peace. The first author particularly remarks, \"that they never made war, or travelled abroad, but employed themselves in tending their herds, or labouring in the ground.\" J. Leo says, p. 65. \"That they lived in common, having no property in land, no tyrant nor superior lord, but supported themselves in an equal state, upon the natural produce of the country, which afforded plenty of roots, game, and honey. That ambition or avarice never drove them into foreign countries to subdue or cheat their neighbours. Thus they lived without toil or superfluities.\" \"The ancient inhabitants of Morocco, who wore coats of mail, and used swords and spears headed with iron, coming amongst these harmless and naked people, soon brought them under subjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gambia into 15 parts; those were the 15 kingdoms of the negroes, over which the Moors presided, and the common people were negroes. These Moors taught the negroes the Mahometan religion, and arts of life; particularly the use of iron, before unknown to them. About the 14th century, a native negro, called Heli Ifchia, expelled the Moorish conquerors; but though the negroes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a negro master. Heli Ifchia himself becoming king, led the negroes on to foreign wars, and established himself in power over a very large extent.\nextent of country;\" Since Leo's time, the Europeans have had very little knowledge of those parts of Africa, nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly probable that it broke into pieces, and that the natives again resumed many of their ancient customs; for in the account published by Moore, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Moorish and Mahometan customs, joined with the original simplicity of the negroes. It appears by accounts of ancient voyages, collected by Hackluit, Purchas, and others, that it was about 50 years before the discovery of America, that the Portuguese attempted to sail round Cape Bojador, which lies between their country and Guinea: this, after divers repulses occasioned by the violent currents, they effected; when landing on the western coasts of Africa, they soon began to make incursions into the country, and to seize and carry off the native inhabitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gonzales, the first who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coast, pursued and attacked a number of them, when some were wounded, as was also one of the Portuguese; which the author records as the first blood spilt by Christians in those parts. Six years after, the same Gonzales again attacked the natives, and took 12 prisoners, with whom he returned to his vessels; he afterwards put a woman on shore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the prisoners; but the next day 150 of the inhabitants appeared on horses and camels, provoking the Portuguese to land; which they not daring to venture, the natives discharged a volley of stones at them, and went off. After this, the Portuguese still continued to send vessels on the coast of Africa: particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled, and, being pursued, 25 were taken; \"he that ran best (says the author), taking the most. In their way home they killed some of the natives, and took 55 more prisoners. Afterwards Dinifanes Dagrama, with two other vessels, landed on the island Arguin, where they took 54 Moors; then running along the coast 80 leagues farther, they at several times took 50 slaves; but here seven of the Portuguese were killed. Then being joined by several other vessels, Dinifanes proposed to destroy the island, to revenge the loss of the seven Portuguese; of which the Moors being apprised, fled, so that no more than 12 were found, whereof only four could be taken, the rest being killed, as also one of the Portuguese.\" Many more captures of this kind on the coast of Barbary and Guinea are recorded to have been made in those early times by the Portuguese; who, in the year 1481, erected their first fort at D'Elmina on that coast, from whence they soon opened a trade for slaves with the inland parts of Guinea.\n\nFrom the foregoing accounts, it is undoubted, that the practice of making slaves of the negroes owes its origin to the early incursions of the Portuguese on the coast of Africa, solely from an inordinate desire of gain. This is clearly evidenced from their own historians, particularly Cada Mosto, about the year 1455, who writes, \"That before the trade was settled for purchasing slaves from the Moors at Arguin, sometimes four, and sometimes more Portuguese vessels, were used to come to that gulf, well armed; and landing by night, would surprise some fishermen's villages: that Guinea, they even entered into the country, and carried off Arabs of both sexes, whom they sold in Portugal.\" And also, \"That the Portuguese and Spaniards, settled on four of the Canary islands, would go to the other island by night, and seize some of the natives of both sexes, whom they sent to be sold in Spain.\"\n\nAfter the settlement of America, those devastations, and the captivating the miserable Africans, greatly increased.\n\nAnderdon, in his History of Trade and Commerce, p. 336, speaking of what passed in the year 1508, writes, \"That the Spaniards had by this time found that the miserable Indian natives, whom they had made to work in their mines and fields, were not so robust and proper for those purposes as negroes brought from Africa: wherefore they, about that time, began to import negroes for that end into Hispaniola, from the Portuguese settlements on the Guinea coasts; and also afterwards for their sugar-works.\"\n\nIt was about the year 1551, towards the latter end of the reign of Edward VI, when some London merchants sent out the first English ship on a trading voyage to the coast of Guinea. This was soon followed by several others to the same parts; but the English not having then any plantations in the West Indies, and consequently no occasion for negroes, such ships traded only for gold, elephants' teeth, and Guinea pepper. This trade was carried on at the hazard of losing their ships and cargoes, if they had fallen into the hands of the Portuguese, who claimed an exclusive right of trade, on account of the several settlements they had made there. In 1553, we find Captain Thomas Windham trading along the coast with 140 men, in three ships, and sailing as far as Benin, which lies about 3000 miles down the coast, to take in a load of pepper. Next year John Loke traded along the coast of Guinea, as far as D'Elmina, when he brought away considerable quantities of gold and ivory. He speaks well of the natives, and says, \"That whoever will deal with them must behave civilly, for they will not traffic if ill used.\" In 1555, William Towerson traded in a peaceable manner with the natives, who made complaint to him of the Portuguese, who were then settled in their castle at D'Elmina; saying, \"They were bad men; who made them slaves if they could take them, putting irons on their legs.\"\n\nThis bad example of the Portuguese was soon followed by some evil disposed Englishmen: for the same Captain Towerson relates*, \"That in the course of his voyage, he perceived the natives near D'Elmina unwilling to come to him, and that he was at last attacked by them; which he understood was done in revenge for the wrong done them the year before by one Captain Gainth, who had taken away the negro captain's son and three others, with their gold, &c. This caused them to join the Portuguese, notwithstanding their hatred of them, against the English.\" The next year Captain Towerson brought these men back again; whereupon the negroes showed him much kindness. Quickly after this, another instance of the same kind occurred in the case of Captain George Fenner, who being on the coast with three vessels, was also attacked by the negroes, who wounded several of his people, and violently carried three of his men to their town.\nThe captain sent a messenger, offering anything they desired for the ransom of his men; but they refused to deliver them; letting him know, \"That three weeks before, an English ship, which came into the road, had carried off three of their people; and that till they were brought again, they would not restore his men, even though they should give their three ships to release them.\" It was probably the evil conduct of these and some other Englishmen which was the occasion of what is mentioned in Hill's Naval History, viz., \"That when Captain Hawkins returned from his first voyage to Africa, Queen Elizabeth sent for him, when he expressed her concern, lest any of the African negroes should be carried off without their free consent; which she declared would be detestable, and would call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.\" Hawkins made great promises, which nevertheless he did not perform; for his next voyage to the coast appears to have been principally calculated to procure negro slaves, in order to sell them to the Spaniards in the West Indies; which occasioned the same author to use these remarkable words: \"Here began the horrid practice of forcing the Africans into slavery; an injustice and barbarity which, so far as there is vengeance in heaven for the worst of crimes, will some time be the destruction of all who act or who encourage it.\" This Captain Hawkins, afterwards Sir John Hawkins, seems to have been the first Englishman who gave public countenance to this wicked traffic: for Anderdon, before mentioned, at p. 401, says, \"That in the year 1562, Captain Hawkins, assisted by subscription of sundry gentlemen, now fitted out three ships; and having learnt that negroes were a very good commodity in Hispaniola, he sailed to the coast of Guinea, took in negroes, and sailed with them for Hispaniola, where he sold them, and his English commodities, and loaded his three vessels with hides, sugar, ginger, &c. with which he returned home anno 1563, making a prosperous voyage.\" As it proved a lucrative business, the trade was continued both by Hawkins and others, as appears from the Naval Chronicle, p. 55: where it is said, \"That on the 18th of October 1564, Captain John Hawkins, with two ships of 700 and 140 tons, sailed for Africa; that on the 8th of December they anchored to the south of Cape Verde, where the captain manned the boat, and sent 80 men in armour into the country, to see if they could take some negroes; but the natives flying from them, they returned to their ships, and proceeded farther down the coast. Here they laid certain days, feeding their men ashore, in order (as the author says) to burn and spoil their towns and take the inhabitants. The land they observed to be well cultivated, there being plenty of grain and fruit of several sorts, and the towns prettily laid out. On the 25th, being informed by the Portuguese of a town of negroes called Bymba, where there was not only a quantity of gold, but 140 inhabitants, they resolved to attack it, having the Portuguese for their guide; but by mismanagement they took but ten negroes, having seven of their own men killed and 27 wounded. They then went farther down the coast; when having procured a number of negroes, they proceeded to the West Indies, where they sold them to the Spaniards.\" And in the same Naval Chronicle, at p. 76, it is said, \"That in the year 1567, Francis Drake, before performing his voyage round the world, went with Sir John Hawkins in his expedition to the coast of Guinea, where taking in a cargo of slaves, they determined to steer for the Caribbee islands.\" How Queen Elizabeth suffered so grievous an infringement of the rights of mankind to be perpetrated by her subjects, and how she was persuaded, about the 35th year of her reign, to grant patents for carrying on a trade from the north part of the river Senegal to 100 leagues beyond Sierra Leonia, which gave rise to the African Company * See Company, vol. v. p. 225, 226.\n\nIt is hard to account for, any otherwise than that it arose from the misrepresentation made to her of the situation of the negroes, and of the advantages it was pretended they would reap from being made acquainted with the Christian religion. This was the case of Louis XIII. of France: who, Labat, in his account of the isles of America, tells us, \"was extremely uneasy at a law by which the negroes of his colonies were to be made slaves; but it being strongly urged to him as the readiest means of their conversion to Christianity, he acquiesced therewith.\" Nevertheless, some of the Christian powers did not so easily give way in this matter: for we find +, \"That Cardinal Cibo, one of the pope's principal ministers of state, wrote a letter on behalf of the college of cardinals, or great council at Rome, to the missionaries in Congo, complaining that the pernicious and abominable abuse of selling slaves was yet continued; requiring them to remedy the same if possible; but this the missionaries saw little hopes of accomplishing, by reason that the trade of the country lay wholly in slaves and ivory.\n\nIt has been urged in justification of this trade, that by purchasing the captives taken in battle, they save the lives of so many human creatures, who otherwise would be sacrificed to the implacable revenge of the victors. But this pretence has been refuted by an appeal to reason and fact. For if the negroes apprehended they should be cruelly put to death if they were not sent away; why, it is asked, do they manifest such reluctance and dread as they generally do, at being brought from their native country? Smith, in his Account, p. 28, says, \"The Gambians abhor slavery, and will attempt any thing, though ever so desperate, to avoid it.\" And Thomas Philips, in his account of a voyage he performed to the coast of Guinea, writes, \"They (the negroes) are so loth to leave their own country, that they have often leaped out of the canoe, boat, or ship, into the sea, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up.\" But had the fact even been otherwise, the above plea is urged with an extreme bad grace, when it is notorious that the very wars said to be productive of such cruelty were fomented by the infamous arts of the Europeans. From the foregoing accounts, as well as other authentic publications of this kind, it appears, that it was the unwarrantable lust of gain which first stimulated the Portuguese, and afterwards other Europeans, to engage in this horrid traffic. By the most unquestionable relations of those early times, the natives were an inoffensive people, who, when civilly used, traded amicably with the Europeans. It is recorded of those of Benin, the largest kingdom in Guinea, that they were a gentle, loving people; and Reynold says, \"They found more sincere proofs of\nlove and good will from the natives, than they could find from the Spaniards and Portuguese, even though they had relieved them from the greatest misery.\" And from the same relations there is no reason to think otherwise, but that they generally lived in peace amongst themselves: there occurring no accounts of any wars at that early period, nor of any fate of captives taken in battle.\n\nIn fact, it was long after the Portuguese had made a practice of violently forcing the natives of Africa into slavery, that we read of the different negro nations making war upon each other, and selling their captives. And probably this was not the case, till those bordering on the coast, who had been used to supply the vessels with necessaries, had become corrupted by their intercourse with the Europeans, and were excited by drunkenness and avarice to join them in carrying on those wicked schemes, by which those unnatural wars were perpetrated; the inhabitants kept in continual alarms; the country laid waste; and, as Moore expresses it, \"infinite numbers sold into slavery.\" But that the Europeans are the principal cause of these devastations, is particularly evidenced by one whose connection with the trade would rather induce him to represent it in the fairest colours, viz. Captain Smith, the person sent in the year 1726, by the African company, to survey their settlements; who, from the information he received of one of the factors who had resided ten years in that country, says, \"That the differing natives account it their greatest unhappiness, that they were ever visited by the Europeans.*—That we Christians introduced the traffic of slaves; and that before our coming they lived in peace.\"\n\nIn the accounts relating to the African trade, we find this melancholy truth farther asserted by some of the principal directors in the different factories; particularly A. Brue says†, \"That the Europeans were far from desiring to act as peace-makers amongst the negroes; which would be acting contrary to their interest, since the greater the wars, the more slaves were procured.\" And William Bofman also remarks‡, \"That one of the former commanders gave large sums of money to the negroes of one nation, to induce them to attack some of the neighbouring nations; which occasioned a battle which was more bloody than the wars of the negroes usually are.\" This is confirmed by J. Barbot, who says, \"That the country of D'Elmina, which was formerly very powerful and populous, was in his time so much drained of its inhabitants by the intestine wars fomented among the negroes by the Dutch, that there did not remain inhabitants enough to till the country.\"\n\nIt has also been advanced as an argument in favour of keeping the negroes in bondage, that there are slaves in Guinea, and that those amongst us might be so in their own country. Not to dwell upon the insufficiency of our giving any countenance to slavery, because the Africans, whom we esteem a barbarous and savage people, allow of it, and perhaps the more from our example; the very circumstance stated, when inquired into, must afford cause of blushing, rather than serve as a palliation of such iniquitous conduct: for it will appear, that the slavery endured in Guinea is by no means so grievous as that in the colonies. Captain Moore, speaking of the natives living on the river Gambia, says, \"That some of the negroes have many house slaves, which are their greatest glory; that those slaves live so well and easily, that it is sometimes a hard matter to know the slaves from their masters or mistresses. And that though in some parts of Africa they sell their slaves born in the family, yet on the river Gambia they think it a very wicked thing.\" The author adds, \"He never heard of but one that ever sold a family slave, except for such crimes as they would have been sold for if they had been free.\" And in Atley's Collection, speaking of the customs of the negroes in that large extent of country farther down the coast, particularly denominated the Coast of Guinea, it is said, \"They have not many slaves on the coast; none but the king or nobles are permitted to buy or sell any; so that they are allowed only what are necessary for their families or tilling the ground.\" The same author adds, \"That they generally use their slaves well, and seldom correct them.\"\n\nFrom the foregoing accounts of the natural disposition of the negroes, and the fruitfulness of most parts of Guinea, which are confirmed by authors of candour, who have written from their own knowledge, it may well be concluded, that the negroes acquaintance with the Europeans might have been a happiness to them; but these, forgetful of their duty as men and Christians, have conducted themselves in so iniquitous a manner, as must necessarily raise in the minds of the thoughtful and well-disposed negroes the utmost scorn and detestation of the very name of Christians. All other considerations have given way to an insatiable desire of gain, which has been the principal and moving cause of the most detestable and barbarous scene that was perhaps ever acted upon the face of the earth; instead of making use of that superior knowledge with which the Almighty, the common Parent of mankind, had favoured them, to strengthen the principle of peace and good will in the breasts of the incautious negroes, the Europeans have, by their bad example, led them into excesses of drunkenness, debauchery, and avarice: whereby every passion of corrupt nature being inflamed, they have been easily prevailed upon to make war and capture one another, as well to furnish means for the excesses they had been habituated to, as to satisfy the greedy desire of gain in their profligate employers; who to this intent have furnished them with prodigious quantities of arms and ammunition. Thus they have been hurried into confusion, distress, and all the extremities of temporal misery; every thing, even the power of their kings, has been made subservient to this wicked purpose; for instead of being protectors of their subjects, some of those rulers, corrupted by the excessive love of spirituous liquors, and the tempting baits laid before them by the factors, have invaded the liberties of their unhappy subjects, and are become their oppressors.\n\nHeret it may be necessary to observe, that the accounts we have of the inhabitants of Guinea are chiefly given by persons engaged in the trade, who, from self-interested views, have described them in such colours as were least likely to excite compassion and respect, and endeavoured to reconcile so manifest a violation of the rights of mankind to the minds of the purchasers; yet they cannot but allow the negroes to be possessed of some good qualities, though they con-\ntrive as much as possible to cast a shade over them. A particular instance of this appears in Astley's Collection, vol. ii. p. 73.; where the author, speaking of the Mandingos settled at Galem, which is situated 900 miles up the Senegal, after saying that they carry on a commerce to all the neighbouring kingdoms, and amass riches, adds, \"That excepting the vices peculiar to the blacks, they are a good sort of people, honest, hospitable, just to their word, laborious, industrious, and very ready to learn arts and sciences.\" Here it is difficult to imagine what vices can be peculiarly attendant on a people so well disposed as the author describes these to be. With respect to the charge some authors have brought against them, as being void of all natural affection, it is frequently contradicted by others. In vol. ii. of the Collection, p. 275 and 629, the negroes of North Guinea and the Gold Coast are said to be fond of their children, whom they love with tenderness. And Bofman says, p. 340, \"Not a few in his country (viz. Holland) fondly imagine, that parents here sell their children, men their wives, and one brother the other; but those who think so, deceive themselves; for this never happens on any other account but that of necessity, or some great crime.\" The same is repeated by J. Barbot, p. 326, and also confirmed by Sir Hans Sloane in the introduction to his natural history of Jamaica; where, speaking of the negroes, he says, \"they are usually thought to be haters of their own children; and therefore it is believed that they sell and dispose of them to strangers for money; but this is not true; for the negroes of Guinea being divided into several captainships, as well as the Indians of America, have wars; and besides those slain in battle, many prisoners are taken, who are sold as slaves, and brought thither; but the parents here, although their children are slaves for ever, yet have no great love for them, that no matters dare fail or give away one of their little ones, unless they care not whether their parents hang themselves or not.\" J. Barbot, speaking of the occasion of the natives of Guinea being represented as a treacherous people, ascribes it to the Hollander (and doubtless other Europeans) usurping authority, and fomenting divisions between the negroes. At p. 110, he says, \"It is well known that many of the European nations trading amongst these people, have very unjustly and inhumanly, without any provocation, stolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coast, but almost everywhere in Guinea, who have come on board their ships in a harmless and confiding manner: these they have in great numbers carried away, and sold in the plantations, with other slaves which they had purchased.\" And although some of the negroes may be justly charged with indolence and supineness, yet many others are frequently mentioned by authors as a careful, industrious, and even laborious people.\n\nBy an inquiry into the laws and customs formerly in use, and still in force among the negroes, particularly on the Gold Coast, it will be found, that provision was made for the general peace, and for the safety of individuals; even in W. Bofman's time, long after the Europeans had established the slave trade, the natives were not publicly enslaved, any otherwise than in punishment for crimes, when prisoners of war, or by a violent exertion of the power of their corrupted kings. Where any of the natives were stolen in order to be sold to the Europeans, it was done secretly, or at least only connived at by those in power: this appears from Barbot and Bofman's account of the matter, both agreeing that man-stealing was not allowed on the Gold Coast. The first says, \"Kidnapping or stealing of human creatures is punished there, and even sometimes with death.\" And Bofman, whose long residence on the coast enabled him to speak with certainty, says, \"That the laws were severe against murder, thievery, and adultery;\" and adds, \"That man-stealing was punished on the Gold Coast with rigid severity, and sometimes with death itself.\" Hence it may be concluded, that the tale of the greatest part of the negroes to the Europeans is supported by violence, in defiance of the laws, through the knavery of their principal men, who (as is too often the case with those in European countries), under pretence of encouraging trade, and increasing the public revenue, disregard the dictates of justice, and trample upon those liberties which they are appointed to preserve.\n\nMoore also mentions man-stealing as being discomfited by the negro governments on the river Gambia; and speaks of the enslaving the peaceable inhabitants, as a violence which only happens under a corrupt administration of justice. He says, \"The kings of that country generally advise with their headmen, scarcely doing anything of consequence without consulting them first, except the king of Barfallay, who being subject to hard drinking, is very absolute. It is to this king's insatiable thirst for brandy, that his subjects' freedoms and families are in so precarious a situation. Whenever this king wants goods or brandy, he sends a messenger to the English governor at James Fort, to desire he would send a ship there with a cargo: this news being not at all unwelcome, the governor lends accordingly; against the arrival of the ship, the king goes and ransacks some of his enemies towns, seizing the people, and selling them for such commodities as he is in want of, which commonly are brandy, guns, powder, balls, pistols, and cutlasses, for his attendants and followers; and coral and silver for his wives and concubines. In case he is not at war with any neighbouring king, he then falls upon one of his own towns, which are numerous, and uses them in the same manner. He often goes with some of his troops by a town in the daytime, and returning in the night, sets fire to three parts of it, and putting guards at the fourth, there seizes the people as they run out from the fire; he ties their arms behind them, and marches them either to Joar or Cohonc, where he sells them to the Europeans.\"\n\nM. Brue, the French director, gives much the same account, and says *, \"That, having received goods, he wrote to the king, that if he had a sufficient number of slaves, he was ready to trade with him. This prince, as well as the other negro monarchs, has always a sure way of supplying his deficiencies, by selling his own subjects, for which they seldom want a pretence. The king had recourse to this method, by seizing 300 of his own people, and sent word to the director that he had the slaves ready to deliver for the goods.\" It seems the king wanted double the quantity of goods which\nwhich the factor would give him for these 300 slaves; but the factor refusing to trust him as he was already in the company's debt, and perceiving that this refusal had put the king much out of temper, he proposed that he should give him a licence for taking so many more of his people as the goods he still wanted were worth; but this the king refused, saying, \"It might occasion a disturbance among his subjects.\" Except in the above instance, and some others, where the power of the negro kings is unlawfully exerted over their subjects, the slave-trade is carried on in Guinea with some regard to the laws of the country, which allow of none to be sold but prisoners taken in their national wars, or people adjudged to slavery in punishment for crimes; but the legislature of the country, the number of kingdoms or commonwealths, and the great encouragement given by the Europeans, afford frequent pretences and opportunities to the bold designing profligates of one kingdom, to surprize and seize upon not only those of a neighbouring government, but also the weak and helpless of their own; and the unhappy people, taken on those occasions, are, with impunity, sold to the Europeans. These practices are doubtless disapproved of by the most considerate amongst the negroes; for Bofman acquaints us, that even their national wars are not agreeable to such. He says, \"If the person who occasioned the beginning of the war be taken, they will not easily admit him to ransom, though his weight of gold should be offered, for fear he should in future form some new design against their repose.\"\n\nWe shall conclude this article with the following account of the shocking methods used in the carrying on of the slave-trade, as described by factors of different nations.\n\nMr Moore*, factor for the English African Company on the river Gambia, writes, \"That there are a number of negro traders, called joncoer, or merchants, who follow the slave-trade as a business; their place of residence is so high up the country as to be six weeks travel from James Fort, which is situated at the mouth of that river. These merchants bring down elephants teeth, and in some years 2000 slaves, most of which, they say, are prisoners taken in war. They buy them from the different princes who take them; many of them are Bumbrogs and Petcharies; nations who each of them have different languages, and are brought from a vast way inland. Their way of bringing them is tying them by the neck with leather thongs, at about a yard distant from each other, 30 or 40 in a string, having generally a bundle of corn or elephants teeth upon each of their heads. In their way from the mountains, they travel through very great woods, where they cannot for some days get water; so they carry in ikin bags enough to support them for a time. I cannot (adds Moore) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade; but there may, perhaps, be about 100, who go up into the inland country with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them purchase, in various countries, gold, slaves, and elephants teeth. Besides the slaves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: These are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes; or else people stolen, which is very frequent.—Since the slave-trade has been used, all punishments are changed into slavery; there being an advantage on such condemnation, they strain for crimes very hard, in order to get the benefit of selling the criminal.\"\n\nJohn Barbot, the French factor, in his account of the manner by which the slaves are procured, says, \"The slaves sold by the negroes are for the most part prisoners of war, or taken in the incursions they make into their enemies territories; others are stolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods; or else in the corn-fields, at the time of the year when their parents keep them there all the day to scare away the devouring small birds.\" Speaking of the transactions on that part of Guinea called the Slave Coast, where the Europeans have the most factories, and from whence they bring away much the greatest number of slaves, the same author says, \"The inhabitants of Coto do much mischief in stealing those slaves they sell to the Europeans from the upland country.—That the inhabitants of Popo excel the former; being endowed with a much larger share of courage, they rob more successfully, by which means they increase their riches and trade.\" The author particularly remarks, \"That they are encouraged in this practice by the Europeans: sometimes it happens, according to the success of their inland excursions, that they are able to furnish 200 slaves or more in a few days.\" And he says, \"The blacks of Fida, or Whidah, are so expeditious in trading for slaves, that they can deliver 1000 every month;\"—\"If there happens to be no flock of slaves there, the factor must trust the blacks with his goods, to the value of 150l. or 200l., which goods they carry up into the inland country to buy slaves, at all markets for above 600 miles up the country, where they are kept like cattle in Europe; the slaves sold there being generally prisoners of war, taken from their enemies like other booty, and perhaps some few sold by their own countrymen, in extreme want, or upon a famine, as also some as a punishment of heinous crimes.\" So far Barbot's account. That given by Bofman is as follows: \"When the slaves which are brought from the inland countries come to Whidah, they are put in prison together; when we treat concerning buying them, they are all brought out together in a large plain, where, by our surgeons, they are thoroughly examined, and that naked, both men and women, without the least distinction or modesty. Those which are approved as good, are set on one side; in the meanwhile a burning iron, with the arms or name of the company, lies in the fire, with which ours are marked on the breast. When we have agreed with the owners of the slaves, they are returned to their prisons; where, from that time forward, they are kept at our charge, and cost us twopence a-day each slave, which serves to subsist them like criminals on bread and water; so that to save charges, we send them on board our ships the very first opportunity; before which, their masters strip them of all they have on their backs, so that they come on board stark naked, as well women as men. In which condition they are obliged to continue, if the matter of the ship is not so charitable (which he commonly is) as to bestow something on them to cover their nakedness. Six or seven hundred are sometimes put on board a vessel, where they lie as close\nclose together as it is possible for them to be crowded (a).\n\nWhen the great income which arises to the negro kings on the Slave Coast, from the slaves brought through their several governments to be shipped on board the European vessels, is considered, we have no cause to wonder that they give so great a countenance to that trade. Bofman says, \"That each ship which comes to Whidah to trade, reckoning one with another, either by toll, trade, or custom, pays about 400l. and sometimes 50 ships come hither in a year.\" Barbot confirms the same, and adds, \"That in the neighbouring kingdom of Arda, the duty to the king is the value of 70 or 80 slaves for each trading ship;\" which is near half as much more as at Whidah. Nor can the Europeans concerned in the trade, with any degree of propriety, blame the African kings for countenancing it, while they continue to send vessels on purpose to take in the slaves which are thus stolen, and that they are permitted, under the sanction of national laws, to sell them to the colonies.\n\nAccording to Mr Ramsay, the annual British exports to these coasts are estimated at 500,000l. including a considerable quantity that is annually exchanged with American and other foreign traders there; about 50,000l. of this is returned in ivory, gold dust, gum, &c. The greatest part of the profits of the slave-trade is raised on the sugar plantations. If by establishing factories, and encouraging civilization on the coast of Africa, and returning some of our West Indian slaves to their original country, we tried to make up for our past treachery to the natives, and instructed the inhabitants in the culture of tobacco, indigo, cotton, rice, &c., to barter with us for our manufactures, and supply us with those articles, our demand for which has been so advantageous to America, would great be our profits. Were Africa civilized, and could we preoccupy the affections of the natives, and introduce gradually our religion, manners, and language among them, we should open a market that would fully employ our manufacturers and seamen, morally speaking, till the end of time. And while we enriched ourselves, we should contribute to their happiness. For Africa, in its highest probable state of culture, could not possibly interfere with the staple of Britain, so as to hinder an extensive and mutually advantageous trade from being carried on between the countries. The great difference of climate and soil must always distinguish the supplies and wants of each.\n\nThe slave-trade, indeed, has been long considered as disgraceful to an enlightened age; and in this country a spirit is arisen which seems bent on annihilating it altogether, or so changing the nature of it as to blend humanity with policy. During the session 1788, the philanthropy of parliament, supported by that of the nation, paid a very particular attention to this odious branch of traffic. It was, however, a subject of too comprehensive a nature, and too materially connected with our African commerce at large and our West Indian colonies, to come to an immediate decision upon it. Parliament, therefore, was obliged to content itself for that time with a temporary bill to regulate the shipping and carrying slaves in British vessels from those coasts. But the public attention has been since kept awake by a great variety of publications on both sides of the question; and the final arrangement of this important business, in which the honour of the British commerce and the British character, as well as the happiness of millions of our noble African brethren, is involved, is expected to take place during the present session 1791.—This traffic in human beings is not, however, without its advocates. But the most specious arguments of its ablest defenders reach no farther than political expediency, which can never alter the real nature of things. That in question would not remain less unjust, cruel, and wicked trade, in its very nature essentially and unalterably wrong. Its abolition, therefore, not in a rush, but in as gentle and equitable a way as circumstances will allow, is devoutly to be wished, and it is hoped may be accomplished.\n\nNew Guinea, or Papua, a long and narrow island of the East Indies, which is yet but imperfectly known. It was supposed to be connected with New Holland, until Captain Cook discovered the strait which separates them. New Guinea, including Papua, its north-western part (which according to Bougainville's conjecture is separated from it by a strait), reaches from the equator to the 12th degree of south latitude, and from 131 to 150 degrees east longitude; in one part it does not appear to be above 50 miles broad. It was first visited by an European ship in 1529. Saavedra, a Portuguese, who made the discovery of the north-west part of this country, called it Terra de Papaias, or Papos. Van Schouten, a Dutch discoverer, afterwards gave the name of New Guinea to its south-western part. Admiral Roggewein also touched here; and before him Dampier, 11 January 1700. Captain Cook made the coast of New Guinea, in latitude 6 degrees 15 minutes, longitude 138 east, on the 3d of September, and landed in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr Banks, Dr Solander, nine of the ship's crew, and servants well armed, and leaving two seamen to take care of the boat, advanced some little way up the country; but coming to the skirts of a thick wood, they judged it prudent to proceed no farther, lest they should fall into an ambuscade of the natives, and their retreat to the boat be cut off. Having advanced about a quarter of a mile from the boat, three Indians rushed out of the wood with a hideous shout; they threw their darts, and showed such a hostile disposition, that the party, to prevent the destruction of these people, returned to the boat, as they had no intention forcibly to invade their country, either to gratify their appetites or curiosity, and it was evident nothing could be done upon friendly terms. When they got on board the boat, they rowed along the shore, and the number of Indians assembled seemed to be between 60 and 100. They made much the same appearance as the New Hollanders, being stark naked, and their hair cropped short. All the while they were shouting defiance, and throwing something out of their hand.\n\n(a) Here it is necessary to observe, that the number of slaves to be taken on board British ships is now regulated by law.\nhand which burnt exactly like gunpowder, but made no report; what these fires were, or for what purpose intended, could not be guessed at; those who discharged them had in their hands a short piece of stick, possibly a hollow cane, which they swung likewise from them, and immediately fire and smoke issued, exactly resembling the discharge of a musket, and of no longer duration. This wonderful phenomenon was observed from the ship; and the deception was so great, that the people on board thought they had fire-arms; and even in the boat, if they had not been so near as that they must have heard the report, if there had been any, they should have thought they had been firing volleys. After looking at them attentively for some time, without taking any notice of their flashing and vociferation, the sailors fired some muskets over their heads. Upon hearing the balls rattle among the trees, they walked leisurely away, and the boat returned to the ship. Upon examining some weapons which the natives had thrown, they were found to be light darts, about four feet long, very ill made, of a reed or bamboo cane, and pointed with hard wood in which there were many barbs. They were discharged with great force, for at 60 yards distance they went beyond the party; but in what manner they were thrown could not be exactly seen. But the general opinion was, that they were thrown with a stick in the manner practised by the New Hollanders.\n\nThe land here is very low, as is every other part of the coast; but it is covered with a luxuriance of wood and herbage that can scarcely be conceived. Here the cocoa-nut, plantain, and bread-fruit, flourish in the highest perfection.\n\nWe are very little acquainted with the natural history of this country; but its zoology is worthy of attention, from its striking and romantic nature. It seems to be the peculiar residence of the beautiful and singular birds of Paradise, of which Mr Pennant has enumerated about 12 species. They are conjectured to breed here, but are generally taken in the neighbouring islands of Arroo, to which they retire during the wet monsoon, in flocks of 30 or 40. Their cry, during their flight, has a strong resemblance to that of a starling; but when surprized with a strong gale, they croak like ravens, and mount into the superior regions of the air. Their food seems to be berries, or, as some think, nutmegs and butterflies. They are shot with blunt arrows, or taken with vicus or bird-line. Here likewise are most elegant parrots and lories; and the crowned pigeon is said to be equal in size to a turkey.\n\nAdded to these are the islands of Wajjoo and Salwati, Arroo and Timorland, the first of which is of considerable magnitude, containing about 100,000 inhabitants; the second is also populous, but they are more ferocious than the people of Wajjoo; the production of the third is chiefly sugar, and the inhabitants sell captives at Banda, which they seize on the main land. Timorland is of considerable extent, but so very little known to geographers, that no particular account can be given of it.\n\nGUINEA, a gold coin, struck and current in Britain. The value or rate of guineas has varied: it was first struck on the footing of 20s. by the scarcity of gold was afterwards advanced to 21s. 6d. but it is now sunk to\n\nThe pound weight troy of gold is cut into 44 parts and a half; each part makes a guinea. This coin, took its denomination guinea, because the gold, of which the first was struck, was brought from that part of Africa called Guinea; for this reason it likewise bore the impreffion of an elephant.\n\nGUINEA COMPANY. See COMPANY, African.\n\nGUINEA-HEN. See NUMIDA, ORNITHOLOGY INDEX.\n\nGUINEA-PIG. See MUS, MAMMALIA INDEX.\n\nGUINEA-WHEAT. See ZEA, BOTANY INDEX.\n\nGUIPUSCOA, the north-east division of the province of Biscay in Spain, situated on the confines of Navarre.\n\nGUISE, a small town of France in the department of Aisne, and in Tierache, with a very strong castle, and the title of a duchy. It is seated on the river Oise, in E. Long. 3° 42'. N. Lat. 49° 54'.\n\nGUISE, Henry, of Lorraine, duke of Guise, eldest son of Francois of Lorraine duke of Guise, memorable in the history of France as a gallant officer; but an imperious, turbulent, factious subject, who placed himself at the head of an armed force, and called his rebel band The League. The plan was formed by the cardinal, his younger brother; and under the pretext of defending the Roman Catholic religion, the king Henry III. and the freedom of the state, against the designs of the Huguenots, or French Protestants, they carried on a civil war, massacred the Huguenots, and governed the king, who forbade his appearance at Paris; but Guise now became an open rebel, entered the city against the king's express order, and put to the sword all who opposed him; the streets being barricaded to prevent his progress, this fatal day is called in the French history, The day of the barricades. Matters of Paris, the policy of the Guises failed them: for they suffered the king to escape to Blois, though he was deserted in his palace at Paris by his very guards. At Blois, Henry convened an assembly of the states of France; the duke of Guise had the boldness to appear to a summons sent him for that purpose: a forced reconciliation took place between him and the king, by the advice of this assembly; but it being accidentally discovered, that Guise had formed a design to dethrone the king, that weak monarch, instead of resolutely bringing him to justice, had him privately assassinated, December 23, 1588, in the 38th year of his age. His brother the cardinal shared the same fate the next day.\n\nGUITAR, GUITARRA, a musical instrument of the stringed kind, with five double rows of strings; of which those that are bass are in the middle, except it be for the burden, an octave lower than the fourth. —This instrument was first used in Spain and by the Italians. In the former country it is still greatly in vogue. There are few of that nation who cannot play on the guitar; and with this instrument they serenade their mistresses at night. At Madrid, and other cities in that country, it is common to meet in the streets young men equipped with a guitar and a dark lanthorn, who, taking their station under the windows, sing, and accompany their voices with this instrument; and there is scarce an artificer or day-labourer in any of the cities or principal towns who does not entertain himself with his guitar.\n\nGULDENSTAEDT, John Anthony, physician and\nand naturalist, was born at Riga, April 26, 1745; received the rudiments of his education in that town; and in 1763 was admitted into the medical college of Berlin. He completed his studies at Frankfort upon the Oder, and in 1767 received the degree of M.D. in that university. On account of his knowledge of foreign languages, and the considerable progress he had made in natural history, he was considered as a fit person to engage in the expeditions which were planned by the Imperial academy. Being invited to St Petersburg, he arrived in that city in 1768, was created adjunct of the academy, and afterwards, in 1770, member of that society, and professor of natural history. In June 1768 he set out upon his travels, and was absent seven years. From Moscow, where he continued till March 1769, he passed to Voronetz, Tzaritzin, Astracan, and Kiflar, a fortress upon the western shore of the Caspian, and close to the confines of Persia. In 1770 he examined the districts watered by the rivers Teirik, Suntha, and Alkai, in the eastern extremity of Caucasus; and in the course of the ensuing year penetrated into Osetia, in the highest part of the same mountain; where he collected vocabularies of the languages spoken in those regions, made inquiries into the history of the people, and discovered some traces of Christianity among them. Having visited Cabarda and the northern chain of the Caucasus, he proceeded to Georgia, and was admitted to an audience of Prince Heraclius, who was encamped about ten miles from Teilis. Having passed the winter here, and in examining the adjacent country, he followed in spring the prince to the province of Kakhetia, and explored the southern districts inhabited by the Turcoman Tartars in the company of a Georgian magnate, whom he had cured of a dangerous disorder. In July he passed into Imeretia, a country which lies between the Caspian and Black seas, and is bounded on the east by Georgia, on the north by Osetia, on the west by Mingrelia, and on the south by the Turkish dominions. He penetrated into the middle chain of Mount Caucasus, visited the confines of Mingrelia, Middle Georgia, and Eastern and Lower Imeretia; and, after escaping many imminent dangers from the banditti of those parts, fortunately returned to Kiflar on the 18th of November, where he passed the winter, collecting various information concerning the neighbouring Tartar tribes of the Caucasus, and particularly the Lefgees. In the following summer he journeyed to Cabarda Major, continued his course to Mount Beshten, the highest point of the first ridge of the Caucasus; inspected the mines of Madshar, and went to Tcherkalik upon the Don. From thence he made expeditions to Azof and Taganrog, and then, along the new limits to the Dnieper. He finished this year's route at Kremenetschuk, in the government of New Russia. In the ensuing spring he was proceeding to Crim Tartary; but receiving an order of recall, he returned through the Ukraine to Moscow and St Petersburg, where he arrived in the month of March 1775. Upon his return, he was employed in arranging his papers; but before he could finish them for the press, was seized with a violent fever, which carried him to the grave in March 1781. His writings, which have been hitherto published consist of a number of curious treatises, of which a list is given in Coxe's Travels, vol. i. p. 162.\n\nGULA, in Anatomy, the oesophagus or gullet; that conduit by which animals take down food into the stomach. See Anatomy, No. 92.\n\nGULE of August, the day of St Peter ad vincula, which is celebrated on the first of August. It is called the gule of August, from the Latin gula, \"a throat,\" for this reason, that one Quirinus, a tribune, having a daughter that had a disease in her throat, went to Pope Alexander, the fifth from St Peter, and desired of him to see the chains that St Peter was chained with under Nero; which request being granted, and she, kissing the chains, was cured of her disease; whereupon the Pope instituted this feast in honour of St Peter; and, as before, this day was termed only the kalends of August, it was on this occasion called indifferently either the day of St Peter ad vincula, from what wrought the miracle; or the gule of August, from that part of the virgin whereon it was wrought.\n\nGULES, in Heraldry, a corruption of the French word goules, which in this science signifies \"red,\" and is represented in engraving by perpendicular lines. It may serve itself to denote martial prowess, boldness, and hardiness; for the ancients used this colour to make themselves terrible to their enemies, to stir up magnanimity, and to prevent the seeing of blood, by the likeness of the colours; for which reason perhaps it is used by the English. But, according to G. Leigh, if this tincture is compounded with\n\n| Or. | Arg. | Azu. | Ver. | Pur. | Sab. |\n|-----|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Defire. | Envy. | Ardour. | Strength. | Justice. | Weariness. |\n\nThis colour is by the generality of the English heralds ranked before azure; but French heralds, N. Upton and his followers, prefer azure to it.\n\nGULF, a broad and capacious bay comprehended between two promontories, and sometimes taking the name of a sea when it is very extensive; but particularly when it only communicates with the sea by means of a strait. Such are the Euxine or Black sea, otherwise called the Gulf of Constantinople; the Adriatic sea, called also the Gulf of Venice; the gulf of Sidra near Barbary; and the gulf of Lyons near France. All these gulfs are in the Mediterranean. There are, besides, the gulf of Mexico, the gulf of St Lawrence, and the gulf of California, which are in North America. There are also the gulf of Persia, otherwise called the Red sea, between Persia and Arabia; the gulf of Bengal in India; and the gulfs of Cochin-china and Kamtchatka, near the countries of the same name.\n\nThe word comes from the French golfe, and that from the Italian golfo, which signify the same. Some deduce these further from the Greek γαλάξις; which Guithart again derives from the Hebrew גָּבֵעַ. Du Cange derives them from the barbarous Latin gulfum, or gulfus, which signify the same thing.\n\nGULL. See Larus, Ornithology Index.\n\nGULLET. See Gula, Anatomy, No. 92.\n\nGUM (Gummi), is a concrete vegetable juice, of no particular smell or taste, becoming viscous and tenacious.\nGUM\n\ncious when moistened with water; totally dissolving in water into a liquid, more or less glutinous in proportion to the quantity of the gum; not dissolving in various spirits or in oils; burning in the fire to a black coal, without melting or catching flame; suffering no distillation in the heat of boiling water.\n\nThe true gums are gum arabic, gum tragacanth, gum fenechal, the gum of cherry and plum trees, and such like. All else have more or less of resin in them.\n\nGum Arabic is the produce of a species of Mimosa; which see in Chemistry and Materia Medica Index.\n\nGum Senegal, is a gum resembling gum arabic, which is brought from the country through which the river Senegal runs, in loofe or finger drops: but these are much larger than those of the gum arabic usually are; sometimes it is of the bigness of an egg, and sometimes much larger: the surface is very rough or wrinkled, and appears much less bright than the inner substance where the masses are broken. It has no smell, and scarce any taste. It is probably produced from a tree of the same kind with the former. The virtues of it are the same with the gum arabic; but it is rarely used in medicine, unless as mixed with the gum arabic; the dyers and calico printers consume the great quantities of it that are annually imported. The negroes dissolve it in milk, and in that state make it a principal ingredient in many of their dishes, and often feed on it thus alone.\n\nGum Tragacanth, the gum of the tragacanth, a thorny bush growing in Crete, Asia, and Greece. See Astragalus, Botany Index.\n\nOther substances known by the name of gums are as follows:\n\nGum Ammoniac. See Ammoniac.\nGum Elemi. See Amyris.\nGum Kino. See Kino.\nGum Guaiacum. See Guaiacum.\nGum Lacc. See Coccus and Lacc.\n\nGum, among gardeners, a kind of gangrene incident to fruit trees of the stone kind, arising from a corruption of the sap; which, by its viscidity, not being able to make its way through the fibres of the tree, is, by the protrusion of other juice, made to extravasate and ooze out upon the bark.\n\nWhen the distemper surrounds the branch, it admits of no remedy; but when only on one part of a bough, it should be taken off to the quick, and some cow-dung clapped on the wound, covered over with a linen cloth, and tied down. M. Quintinie directs to cut off the morbid branch two or three inches below the part affected.\n\nGUMMA, a sort of venereal excrescence on the periosteum of the bones.\n\nGUMS, in Anatomy, the hard fleety substance in either jaw, through which the teeth spring from the jaw-bone. See Anatomy, No. 105.\n\nThe gums are apt to become spongy, and to separate from the teeth; but the cause is frequently a stony kind of crust, which forms itself therein, which, when separated, the gums soon return to their former state, especially if rubbed with a mixture of the infusion of roses four parts, and the tincture of myrrh one part.—The scurvy is another disorder which affects the gums.\n\nThis disorder, when not manifest in any other part, sometimes appears in this: indeed, when a scorbutic disorder invades the whole habit, its first symptom is a putrid state of the gums.\n\nGUN, in the military art, a fire arm, or weapon of offence, which forcibly discharges a ball or other hard and solid matter through a cylindrical tube, by means of inflamed gun-powder. See Gun-Powder.\n\nThe word gun now includes most of the species of fire-arms; pistols and mortars being almost the only ones excepted from this denomination. They are divided into great and small guns: the former including all that we also call cannon, ordnance or artillery; the latter includes musquets, carbines, musqueteons, blunderbusses, fowling-pieces, &c.\n\nIt is not known at what time these weapons were first invented. Though, comparatively speaking, the introduction of guns into the western part of the world is but of a modern date; yet it is certain that in some parts of Asia they have been used, though in a very rude and imperfect manner for many ages.—Philostratus speaks of a city near the river Hyphasis in the Indies, which was said to be impregnable, and that its inhabitants were relations of the gods, because they threw thunder and lightning upon their enemies. Hence some imagine that guns were used by the eastern nations even in the time of Alexander the Great; but however this may be, many of our modern travellers assert that they were used in China as far back as the year of Christ 85, and have continued in use ever since.\n\nThe first hint of the invention of guns in Europe is in the works of Roger Bacon, who flourished in the 13th century. In a treatise written by him about the year 1280, he proposes to apply the violent explosive force of gun-powder for the destruction of armies. In 1320, Bartholomew Schwartz, a German monk, is commonly said to have invented gun-powder, though it is certainly known that this composition is described by Bacon in some of his treatises long before the time of Schwartz. The following is said to have been the manner in which Schwartz invented gun-powder. Having pounded the materials for it in a mortar, which he afterwards covered with a stone, a spark of fire accidentally fell into the mortar and set the mixture on fire; upon which the explosion blew the stone to a considerable distance. Hence it is probable that Schwartz might be taught the simplest method of applying it in war; for Bacon seems rather to have conceived the manner of using it to be by the violent effort of the flame unconfinéd, and which is indeed capable of producing astonishing effects*. The figure and name of mortars* See Gun-given to a species of old artillery, and their employment powder. (which was throwing great stone bullets at an elevation), very much corroborates this conjecture.\n\nSoon after the time of Schwartz, we find guns commonly made use of as instruments of war. Great guns were first used. They were originally made of iron bars soldered together, and fortified with strong iron hoops; some of which are still to be seen, viz. one in the Tower of London, two at Woolwich, and one in the royal arsenal at Lisbon. Others were made of thin sheets of iron rolled up together and hooped; and on emergencies they were made of leather, with plates of iron or copper. These pieces were made in a rude and imperfect manner, like the first essays of many new inventions.\nGun inventions. Stone balls were thrown out of them, and a small quantity of powder used on account of their weakness. These pieces had no ornaments, were placed on their carriages by rings, and were of a cylindrical form. When or by whom they were made is uncertain: the Venetians, however, used cannon at the siege of Claudia Jaffa, now called Chioggia, in 1366, which were brought thither by two Germans, with some powder and leaden balls; as likewise in their wars with the Genoese in 1379. King Edward III. made use of cannon at the battle of Crecy in 1346, and at the siege of Calais in 1347. Cannon were made use of by the Turks at the siege of Constantinople, then in possession of the Christians, in 1394, and in that of 1452, that threw a weight of 100lb. but they generally burst either the first, second, or third shot. Louis XII. had one cast at Tours, of the same size, which threw a ball from the Bastille to Charenton. One of those famous cannon was taken at the siege of Dieu in 1546, by Don John de Castro; and is in the castle of St Julião da Barra, 10 miles from Lisbon: its length is 20 feet 7 inches, diameter at the centre 6 feet 3 inches, and it discharges a ball of 100lb. It has neither dolphins, rings, nor button; is of a curious kind of metal; and has a large Indostan inscription upon it, which says it was cast in 1400.\n\nFormerly the cannon were dignified with uncommon names; for in 1503, Louis XII. had 12 brass cannon cast, of an extraordinary size, called after the names of the 12 peers of France. The Spanish and Portuguese called them after their saints. The emperor Charles V. when he marched before Tunis, founded the 12 apostles. At Milan there is a 70 pounder, called the Pimontelle; and one at Bois-le-duc, called the Devil. A 60 pounder at Dover-castle, called Queen Elizabeth's pocket-pistol. An 80 pounder in the Tower of London (formerly in Edinburgh-castle), called Mounts-meg. An 80 pounder in the royal arsenal at Berlin, called the Thunderer. An 80 pounder at Malaga, called the Terrible. Two curious 60 pounders in the arsenal at Bremen, called the Messengers of bad news. And, lastly, an uncommon 70 pounder in the castle of St Angelo at Rome, made of the nails that fastened the copper plates which covered the ancient Pantheon, with this inscription upon it: Ex clavis trabalibus porticus Agrippae.\n\nIn the beginning of the 15th century these uncommon names were generally abolished, and the following more universal ones took place, viz.\n\n| Cannon royal, or carthoun | =48 | about 90 |\n|---------------------------|-----|---------|\n| Bastard cannon, or ½ carthoun | =36 | 79 |\n| Whole culverins | =18 | 50 |\n| Demi culverins | =9 | 30 |\n| Falcon | =6 | 25 |\n| lowest fort | =5 | 13 |\n| Sacker ordinary | =6 | 15 |\n| largest size | =8 | 18 |\n| Bafilisk | =48 | 85 |\n| Serpentine | =4 | 8 |\n| Alpice | =2 | 7 |\n\nPounders Cwt.

Thus a piece that discharges a ball of 24 pounds is called a 24 pounder; one that carries a ball of 12 pounds is called a 12 pounder; and so of the rest, divided into the following sorts, viz.\n\nShip guns, consisting in 42, 36, 32, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, and 3 pounders.\nGarrison guns, in 42, 32, 24, 18, 12, 9, and 6 pounders.\nBattering guns, in 24, 18, and 12 pounders.\nField-pieces, in 12, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1½, 1, and ½ pounders.\n\nMortars are thought to have been fully as ancient as cannon. They were employed in the wars of Italy, to throw balls of red-hot iron, stones, &c. long before the invention of shells. These last are thought to be of German invention, and the use of them in war to have been taught by the following accident. A citizen of Venlo, at a certain festival celebrated in honour of the duke of Cleves, threw a number of shells, one of which fell on a house and set fire to it, by which misfortune the greatest part of the town was reduced to ashes. The first account of shells used for military purposes is in 1435, when Naples was besieged by Charles VIII. History informs us with more certainty, that shells were thrown out of mortars at the siege of Wachtendonk in Guelderland, in 1588, by the earl of Mansfeld. Mr Maitre, an English engineer, first taught the French the art of throwing shells, which they practised at the siege of Motte in 1634. The method of throwing red-hot balls out of mortars was first certainly put in practice at the siege of Stralsund in 1675 by the elector of Brandenburg; though some lay in 1653 at the siege of Bremen. For the proper dimensions of guns, their weight, the metal of which they are formed, &c. see the article Gunnery.\n\nMuskets were first used at the siege of Rhege in the year 1521. The Spaniards were the first who armed part of their foot with these weapons. At first they were very heavy, and could not be used without a rest. They had match-locks, and did execution at a great distance. On their march the soldiers carried only the rests and ammunition, and had boys to bear their muskets after them. They were very slow in loading, not only by reason of the unwieldiness of their pieces, and because they carried the powder and ball separate, but from the time it took to prepare and adjust the match; so that their fire was not near so brisk as ours is now. Afterwards a lighter matchlock-musket came into use; and they carried their ammunition in bandoliers, to which were hung several little cases of wood.\nGUNDELIA, wood covered with leather, each containing a charge of powder. The balls were carried loose in a pouch, and a priming-horn hanging by their side. The muskets with rests were used as late as the beginning of the civil wars in the time of Charles I. The lighter kind succeeded them, and continued till the beginning of the present century, when they also were disused, and the troops throughout Europe armed with firelocks.\n\nGUNDELIA, a genus of plants belonging to the syngenesia class; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae.

I. History of Gunnery.\n\nThe ancients, who knew not the use of gunpowder and fire-arms, had notwithstanding machines which were capable of discharging stones, darts, and arrows, with great force. These were actuated chiefly by the elastic force of ropes, or of strong springs, and required a great number of men to work them; for which reason, the explosion of gunpowder, as acting instantaneously, and seemingly with irresistible force, seemed to be a most proper succedaneum for all the powers by which the military engines in former times were actuated. It soon appeared, however, that this force was not very easily applied. Though the experiment of Bartholomew Schwartz, mentioned under the article Gun, had given a good hint towards this application in a successful manner, yet the violent reduction of the inflamed powder on the containing vessels rendered them very apt to burst, to the great danger of those who stood near them. The gunpowder in those days, therefore, was much weaker than it is now made; though this proved a very insufficient remedy for the inconvenience above mentioned. It was also soon discovered, that iron bullets of much less weight than stone ones would be more efficacious if impelled by greater quantities of stronger powder. This occasioned an alteration in the matter and form of the cannon, which were now cast of brass. These were lighter and more manageable than the former, at the same time that they were stronger in proportion to their bore. Thus they were capable of enduring greater charges of a better powder than what had been formerly used; and their iron bullets (which were from 40 to 60 pounds weight) being impelled with greater velocities, were more effectual than the heaviest stones could ever prove. This change took place about the latter end of the 15th century.\n\nBy this means powder compounded in the manner now practised over all Europe came first into use. But the change of the proportion of materials was not the only improvement it received. The method of grinding it is undoubtedly a considerable advantage. At first the powder was always in the form of fine meal, such as it was reduced to by grinding the materials together. It is doubtful whether the first grinding of powder was intended to increase its strength, or only to render it more convenient for filling into small charges and the charging of small arms, to which alone it was applied for many years, whilst meal-powder was still made use of for cannon. But at last the additional strength which the grained powder was found to acquire from the free passage of the air between the grains, occasioned the meal-powder to be entirely laid aside.\n\nFor the last two hundred years, the formation of cannon hath been very little improved; the best pieces of modern artillery differing little in their proportions from those used in the time of Charles V. Indeed lighter and shorter pieces have been often proposed and essayed; but though they have their advantages in particular cases, yet it seems now to be agreed that they are altogether insufficient for general service. But though the proportions of the pieces have not been much varied within that period, yet their use and application have undergone considerable alterations; the same ends being now accomplished by smaller pieces than what were formerly thought necessary. Thus the battering cannon now universally approved of are those formerly called demi-cannons, carrying a ball of 24 pounds weight; it being found by experience, that their stroke though less violent than that of larger pieces, is yet sufficiently adapted to the strength of the usual profiles of fortification; and that the facility of their carriage and management, and the ammunition they spare, give them great advantages beyond the whole cannons formerly employed in making\nTheory of gunnery.\n\nThe use of fire-arms had been known for a long time before any theory concerning them was attempted. The first author who wrote professedly on the flight of cannon-shot was Tartalea. In 1537 he published a book, at Venice, entitled Nova Scientia; and afterwards another, entitled Quæstii et Inventioni diversi, printed at the same place in 1546, in which he treats professedly on these motions. His discoveries were but few, on account of the imperfect state of mechanical knowledge at that time. However, he determined, that the greatest range of cannon was with an elevation of 45 degrees. He likewise determined, (contrary to the opinion of practitioners,) that no part of the track described by a bullet was a right line; although the curvature was in some cases so little, that it was not attended to. He compared it to the surface of the sea; which, though it appears to be a plane, is yet undoubtedly incurvated round the centre of the earth. He also affirms to himself the invention of the gunner's quadrant, and often gave shrewd guesses at the event of some untried methods. But as he had not opportunities of being conversant in the practice, and founded his opinions only on speculation, he was condemned by most of the succeeding writers, though often without any sufficient reason. The philosophers of those times also intermeddled in the questions hence arising; and many disputes on motion were set on foot (especially in Italy,) which continued till the time of Galileo, and probably gave rise to his celebrated Dialogues on motion. These were published in the year 1638; but in this interval, and before Galileo's doctrine was thoroughly established, many theories of the motion of military projectiles, and many tables of their comparative ranges at different elevations, were published; all of them egregiously fallacious, and utterly irreconcilable with the motions of these bodies. Very few of the ancients indeed refrained from indulging themselves in speculations concerning the difference between natural, violent, and mixed motions; although scarce any two of them could agree in their theories.\n\nIt is strange, however, that, during all these contents, so few of those who were intrusted with the charge of artillery thought it worth while to bring these theories to the test of experiment. Mr. Robins informs us, in his Preface to the New Principles of artillery-Gunnery, that he had met with no more than four authors who had treated on this subject. The first of these is Collado, who has given the ranges of a falconet carrying a three-pound shot to each point of the gunner's quadrant. But from his numbers it is manifest, that the piece was not charged with its customary allotment of gunpowder. The results of his trials were, that the point-blank shot, or that in which the path of the ball did not sensibly deviate from a right line, extended 268 paces. At an elevation of one point (or \\( \\frac{9}{12} \\) of the gunner's quadrant) the range was 594 paces; at an elevation of two points, 794 paces; at three points, 954 paces; at four, 1010; at five, 1040; and at six, 1053 paces. At the seventh point, the range fell between those of the third and fourth; at the eighth point, it fell between the ranges of the second and third; at the ninth point, it fell between the ranges of the first and second; at the tenth point, it fell between the point-blank distance and that of the first point; and at the eleventh point, it fell very near the piece.—The paces spoke of by this author are not geometrical ones, but common steps.\n\nThe year after Collado's treatise, another appeared on the same subject by one Bourne an Englishman. His elevations were not regulated by the points of the gunner's quadrant, but by degrees: and he affirms the proportions between the ranges at different elevations and the extent of point-blank shot. According to him, if the extent of the point-blank shot be represented by 1, the range at 5° elevation will be \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\); at 10° it will be \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\); at 15° it will be \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\); at 20° it will be \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\), and the greatest random will be \\( \\frac{5}{6} \\). This last, he tells us, is in a calm day when the piece is elevated to 42°; but according to the strength of the wind, and as it favours or opposes the flight of the shot, it may be from 45° to 50°.—He hath not informed us with what piece he made his trials; though by his proportions it seems to have been a small one. This however ought to have been attended to, as the relation between the extent of different ranges varies extremely according to the velocity and density of the bullet.\n\nAfter him Eldred and Anderson, both Englishmen, published treatises on this subject. The first published his treatise in 1646, and has given the actual ranges of different pieces of artillery at small elevations, all under ten degrees. His principles were not rigorously true, though not liable to very considerable errors; yet, in consequence of their deviation from the truth,\nhe found it impossible to make some of his experiments agree with his principles.\n\nIn 1638, Galileo printed his dialogues on motion. In these he pointed out the general laws observed by nature in the production and composition of motion; and was the first who described the action and effects of gravity on falling bodies. On these principles he determined, that the flight of a cannon (hot, or any other projectile, would be in the curve of a parabola, except in so far as it was diverted from that track by the resistance of the air. He has also proposed the means of examining the inequalities which arise from thence, and of discovering what sensible effects that resistance would produce in the motion of a bullet at some given distance from the piece.\n\nThough Galileo had thus shown, that, independent of the resistance of the air, all projectiles would, in their flight, describe the curve of a parabola; yet those who came after him, seem never to have imagined that it was necessary to consider how far the operations of gunnery were affected by this resistance. The subsequent writers indeed boldly asserted, without making the experiment, that no considerable variation could arise from the resistance of the air in the flight of shells or cannon shot. In this persuasion they supported themselves chiefly by considering the extreme rarity of the air, compared with those dense and ponderous bodies; and at last it became an almost generally established maxim, that the flight of these bodies was nearly in the curve of a parabola.\n\nIn 1674, Mr Anderson above mentioned published his treatise on the nature and effects of the gun; in which he proceeds on the principles of Galileo, and strenuously affirms, that the flight of all bullets is in the curve of a parabola; undertaking to answer all objections that could be brought to the contrary. The same thing was also undertaken by Mr Blondel, in a treatise published at Paris in 1683; where, after long discussion, the author concludes, that the variations from the air's resistance are so slight as scarcely to merit notice. The same subject is treated of in the Philosophical Transactions, No. 216, p. 68, by Dr Halley; and he also, swayed by the very great difference between the density of the air and that of iron or lead, thinks it reasonable to believe, that the opposition of the air to large metal-shot is scarcely discernible; although in small and light shot he owns that it must be accounted for.\n\nBut though this hypothesis went on smoothly in speculation; yet Anderson, who made a great number of trials, found it impossible to support it without some new modification. For though it does not appear that he ever examined the comparative ranges of either cannon or musket shot when fired with their usual velocities, yet his experiments on the ranges of shells thrown with small velocities (in comparison of those above mentioned), convinced him that their whole track was not parabolical. But instead of making the proper inferences from hence, and concluding the resistance of the air to be of considerable efficacy, he framed a new hypothesis; which was, that the shell or bullet, at its first discharge, flew to a certain distance in a right line, from the end of which line only it began to describe a parabola. And this right line, which he calls the line of the impulse of the fire, he supposes to be the same in all elevations. Thus, by affixing a proper length to this line of impulse, it was always in his power to reconcile any two shots made at different angles, let them differ as widely as we please to suppose. But this he could not have done with three shots; nor indeed doth he ever tell us the event of his experiments when three ranges were tried at one time.\n\nWhen Sir Isaac Newton's Principia was published, he particularly considered the resistance of the air to the air's projectiles which moved with small velocities; but as town by he never had an opportunity of making experiments Newton, on those which move with such prodigious swiftness, he did not imagine that a difference in velocity could make such differences in the resistance as are now found to take place. Sir Isaac found, that, in small velocities, the resistance was increased in the duplicate proportion of the swiftness with which the body moved; that is, a body moving with twice the velocity of another of equal magnitude, would meet with four times as much resistance as the first, with thrice the velocity it would meet with nine times the resistance, &c.—This principle itself is now found to be erroneous with regard to military projectiles; though, if it had been properly attended to, the resistance of the air might even from thence have been reckoned much more considerable than was commonly done. So far, however, were those who treated this subject scientifically, from giving a proper allowance for the resistance of the atmosphere, that their theories differed most egregiously from the truth. Huygens alone seems to have attended to this principle: for, in the year 1690, he published a Treatise on Gravity, in which he gave an account of some experiments tending to prove, that the track of all projectiles moving with very swift motions was widely different from that of a parabola. All the rest of the learned acquiesced in the justness of Galileo's doctrine, and very erroneous calculations concerning the ranges of cannon were accordingly given. Nor was any notice taken of these errors till the year 1716.\n\nAt that time M. Reffons, a French officer of artillery distinguished by the number of sieges at which he had served, by his high military rank, and by his abilities in science, gave in a memoir to the Royal Academy, of which he was a member, importing, that, \"although it was agreed, that theory joined with practice did constitute the perfection of every art; yet experience had taught him, that theory was of very little service in the use of mortars: That the works of M. Blondel had justly enough described the several parabolic lines, according to the different degrees of the elevation of the piece; but that practice had convinced him, there was no theory in the effect of gunpowder; for having endeavoured, with the greatest precision, to point a mortar agreeably to these calculations, he had never been able to establish any solid foundation upon them.\"\n\nFrom the history of the academy, it doth not appear that the sentiments of M. Reffons were at any time controverted, or any reason offered for the failure of the theory of projectiles when applied to use. Nothing farther, however, was done till the time of Benjamin Robins, who in 1742 published a treatise, entitled, New Principles of Gunnery, in which he hath introduced a true theory.\nTheory. atmosphere, but almost every thing else relating to the flight of military projectiles, and indeed advanced the theory of gunnery much nearer perfection than ever it was before.\n\nThe first thing considered by Mr Robins, and which is indeed the foundation of all other particulars relative to gunnery, is the explosive force of gunpowder. This he determined to be owing to an elastic fluid similar to our atmosphere, having its elastic force greatly increased by the heat. \"If a red-hot iron (says he) be included in a receiver, and the receiver be exhausted, and gunpowder be then let fall on the iron, the powder will take fire, and the mercurial gage will suddenly descend upon the explosion; and though it immediately ascends again, it will never rise to the height it first stood at, but will continue depressed by a space proportioned to the quantity of powder which was let fall on the iron.—The same production likewise takes place when gunpowder is fired in the air: for if a small quantity of powder is placed in the upper part of a glass tube, the lower part of which is immersed in water, and the fluid be made to rise so near the top, that only a small portion of air is left in that part where the gunpowder is placed; if in this situation the communication of the upper part of the tube with the external air is closed, and the gunpowder fired, which may be easily done by means of a burning-glass, the water will in this experiment descend on the explosion, as the quicksilver did in the last; and will always continue depressed below the place at which it stood before the explosion. The quantity of this depression will be greater if the quantity of powder be increased, or the diameter of the tube be diminished.\n\n\"When any considerable quantity of gunpowder is fired in an exhausted receiver, by being let fall on a red-hot iron, the mercurial gage instantly descends upon the explosion, and as suddenly ascends again. After a few vibrations, none of which except the first are of any great extent, it seemingly fixes at a point lower than where it stood before the explosion. But even when the gage has acquired this point of apparent rest, it still continues rising for a considerable time, although by such imperceptible degrees, that it can only be discovered by comparing its place at distant intervals: however, it will not always continue to ascend; but will rise slower and slower, till at last it will be absolutely fixed at a point lower than where the mercury stood before the explosion. The same circumstances nearly happen, when powder is fired in the upper part of an unexhausted tube, whose lower part is immersed in water.\n\n\"That the elasticity or pressure of the fluid produced by the firing of gunpowder is, ceteris paribus, directly as its density, may be proved from hence, that if in the same receiver a double quantity of powder be let fall, the mercury will subside twice as much as in the firing of a single quantity. Also the deflections of the mercury, when equal quantities of powder are fired in different receivers, are reciprocally as the capacities of those receivers, and consequently as the density of the produced fluid in each. But as, in the usual method of trying this experiment, the quantities of powder are so very small that it is difficult to ascertain these proportions with the requisite degree of exactness, I took a large receiver containing about 520 inches, and let-\n\nting fall at once on the red-hot iron one dram or the fifteenth part of an ounce avoirdupois of powder, the receiver being first nearly exhausted; the mercury, after the explosion, was subsided two inches exactly, and all the powder had taken fire. Then heating the iron a second time, and exhausting the receiver as before, two drams were let down at once, which sunk the mercury three inches and three quarters; and a small part of the powder had fallen beside the iron, which (the bottom of the receiver being wet) did not fire, and the quantity which thus escaped did appear to be nearly sufficient, had it fallen on the iron, to have sunk the mercury a quarter of an inch more; in which case the two deflections, viz. two inches and four inches, would have been accurately in the proportion of the respective quantities of powder; from which proportion, as it was, they very little varied.\n\n\"As different kinds of gunpowder produce different quantities of this fluid, in proportion to their different degrees of goodness, before any definite determination of this kind can take place, it is necessary to ascertain the particular species of powder that is proposed to be used. (Here Mr Robins determines in all his experiments to make use of government-powder, as consisting of a certain and invariable proportion of materials, and therefore preferable to such kinds as are made according to the fancy of private persons.)\n\n\"This being settled, we must further premise these two principles: 1. That the elasticity of this fluid increases by heat and diminishes by cold, in the same manner as that of the air; 2. That the density of this fluid, and consequently its weight, is the same with the weight of an equal bulk of air, having the same elasticity and the same temperature. Now from the last experiment it appears, that \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) of an ounce avoirdupois or about 27 grains Troy of powder, sunk the gage, on its explosion, two inches; and the mercury in the barometer standing at near 30 inches, \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)ths of an ounce avoirdupois or 410 grains Troy, would have filled the receiver with a fluid whose elasticity would have been equal to the whole pressure of the atmosphere, or the same with the elasticity of the air we breathe; and the contents of the receiver, being about 520 cubic inches, it follows, that \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\)ths of an ounce of powder will produce 520 cubic inches of a fluid possessing the same degree of elasticity with the common air; whence an ounce of powder will produce near 575 cubic inches of such a fluid.\n\n\"But in order to ascertain the density of this fluid, we must consider what part of its elasticity, at the time of this determination, was owing to the heat it received from the included hot iron and the warm receiver. Now the general heat of the receiver being manifestly less than that of boiling water, which is known to increase the elasticity of the air to somewhat more than \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of its augmented quantity; I collect from hence and other circumstances, that the augmentation of elasticity from this cause was about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of the whole; that is, if the fluid arising from the explosion had been reduced to the temperature of the external air, the descent of the mercurial gage, instead of two inches, would have been only 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch; whence 575, reduced in the proportion of five to four, becomes 462; and this last number represents the cubic inches of an elastic fluid equal in density and elasticity with common air, which are produ-\nGUNNERY.\n\nTheory.\n\nceed from the explosion of 1 ounce avoirdupois of gunpowder; the weight of which quantity of fluid, according to the usual estimation of the weight of air, is 131 grains; whence the weight of this fluid is $\\frac{4}{17}$ or $\\frac{1}{5}$ this nearly of the weight of the generating powder. The ratio of the bulk of gunpowder to the bulk of this fluid may be determined from considering that 17 drams avoirdupois of powder fill two cubic inches, if the powder be well shaken together; therefore, augmenting the number last found in the proportion of 16 to 17, the resulting term 488$\\frac{1}{2}$ is the number of cubic inches of an elastic fluid, equal in density with the air produced from two cubic inches of powder; whence the ratio of the respective bulk of the powder, and of the fluid produced from it, is in round numbers as 1 to 244.$^1$\n\nThis calculation was afterwards justified by experiments.\n\n\"If this fluid, instead of expanding when the powder was fired, had been confined in the same space which the powder filled before the explosion; then it would have had, in that confined state, a degree of elasticity 244 times greater than that of common air; and this independent of the great augmentation which this elasticity would receive from the action of the fire in that instant.\n\n\"Hence, then, we are certain, that any quantity of powder, fired in a confined space, which it adequately fills, exerts, at the instant of its explosion, against the sides of the vessel containing it, and the bodies it impels before it, a force at least 244 times greater than the elasticity of the common air, or, which is the same thing, than the pressure of the atmosphere; and this without conferring the great addition which this force will receive from the violent degree of heat with which it is affected at that time.\n\n\"To determine how far the elasticity of air is augmented when heated to the extreme degree of red-hot iron, I took a piece of a musket-barrel about six inches in length, and ordered one end to be closed up entirely; but the other end was drawn out conically, and finished in an aperture of about $\\frac{1}{8}$ of an inch in diameter. The tube thus fitted, was heated to the extremity of a red heat in a smith's forge; and was then immersed with its aperture downwards in a bucket of water, and kept there till it was cool; after which it was taken out carefully, and the water which had entered it in cooling was exactly weighed. The heat given to the tube at each time, was the beginning of what workmen call a sulute heat; and to prevent the rushing in of the aqueous vapour at the immersion, which would otherwise drive out great part of the air, and render the experiment fallacious, I had an iron wire filed tapering, so as to fit the aperture of the tube, and with this I always stopped it up before it was taken from the fire, letting the wire remain in till the whole was cool, when, removing it, the due quantity of water would enter. The weight of the water thus taken in at three different trials was 610 grains, 595 grains, and 600 grains, respectively. The content of the whole cavity of the tube was 796 grains of water; whence the spaces remaining unfilled in these three experiments were 186, 201, and 196 grains respectively. These spaces undoubtedly contained all the air which, when the tube was red-hot, extended through its whole concavity; consequently the elasticity of the air, when heated to the extreme heat of red-hot iron, was to the elasticity of the same air, when reduced to the temperature of the ambient atmosphere, as the whole capacity of the tube to the respective spaces taken up by the cooled air: that is, as 796 to 186, 201, 196; or taking the medium of these three trials, as 796 to 194.$^2$\n\n\"As air and this fluid appear to be equally affected by heat and cold, and consequently have their elasticities equally augmented by the addition of equal degrees of heat to each; if we suppose the heat with which the flame of fired powder is endowed to be the same with that of the extreme heat of red-hot iron, then the elasticity of the generated fluid will be greater at the time of the explosion than afterwards, when it is reduced to the temperature of the ambient air, in the ratio of 796 to 194 nearly. It being allowed then, (which surely is very reasonable), that the flame of gunpowder is not less hot than red-hot iron, and the elasticity of the air, and consequently of the fluid generated by the explosion, being augmented in the extremity of this heat in the ratio of 194$^3$ to 796, it follows, that if 244 be augmented in this ratio, the resulting number, which is 999$^3$, will determine how many times the elasticity of the flame of fired powder exceeds the elasticity of common air, supposing it to be confined in the same space which the powder filled before it was fired.—Hence then the absolute quantity of the pressure exerted by gunpowder at the moment of its explosion may be assigned; for, since the fluid then generated has an elasticity of 999$^3$, or in round numbers 1000 times greater than that of the atmosphere, and since common air by its elasticity exerts a pressure on any given surface equal to the weight of the incumbent atmosphere with which it is in equilibrium, the pressure exerted by fired powder before it dilated itself is 1000 times greater than the pressure of this force, on a surface of an inch square, amounts to power above six tons weight; which force, however, diminishes as the fluid dilates itself.\n\n\"But though we have here supposed that the heat of gunpowder, when fired in any considerable quantity, is the same with iron heated to the extremity of red heat, or to the beginning of a white heat, yet it cannot be doubted but that the fire produced in the explosion is somewhat varied (like all other fires) by a greater or less quantity of fuel; and it may be presumed, that, according to the quantity of powder fired together, the flame may have all the different degrees, from a languid red heat to that sufficient for the vitrification of metals. But as the quantity of powder requisite for the production of this last mentioned heat, is certainly greater than what is ever fired together for any military purpose, we cannot be far from our scope, if we suppose the heat of such quantities as are usually fired to be nearly the same with that of red-hot iron; allowing a gradual augmentation to this heat in larger quantities, and diminishing it when the quantities are very small.\n\nHaving thus determined the force of the gunpowder, Mr Robins next proceeds to determine the velocity with which the ball is discharged. The solution of this problem depends on the two following principles:\n\n1. That the action of the powder on the bullet ceases at balls.\nas soon as the bullet is got out of the piece. That all the powder of the charge is fired and converted into elastic fluid before the bullet is sensibly moved from its place.\n\n\"The first of these (says Mr Robins) will appear manifest when it is considered how suddenly the flame will extend itself on every side, by its own elasticity, when it is once got out of the mouth of the piece; for by this means its force will then be dissipated, and the bullet no longer sensibly affected by it.\n\n\"The second principle is indeed less obvious, being contrary to the general opinion of almost all writers on this subject. It might, however, be sufficient for the proof of this position, to observe the prodigious compression of the flame in the chamber of the piece. Those who attend to this circumstance, and to the easy passage of the flame through the intervals of the grains, may soon satisfy themselves, that no one grain contained in that chamber can continue for any time uninflamed, when thus surrounded and pressed by such an active fire. However, not to rely on mere speculation in a matter of so much consequence, I considered, that if part only of the powder is fired, and that successively; then by laying a greater weight before the charge (suppose two or three bullets instead of one), a greater quantity of powder would necessarily be fired, since a heavier weight would be a longer time in passing through the barrel. Whence it should follow, that two or three bullets would be impelled by a much greater force than one only. But the contrary to this appears by experiment; for, firing one, two, and three bullets laid contiguous to each other with the same charge respectively, I have found that their velocities were not much different from the reciprocal of their subduplicate quantities of matter; that is, if a given charge would communicate to one bullet a velocity of 1750 feet in a second, the same charge would communicate to two bullets a velocity from 1250 to 1300 feet in a second, and to three bullets a velocity from 1050 to 1100 feet in the same time. From hence it appears, that, whether a piece is loaded with a greater or less weight of bullet, the action is nearly the same; since all mathematicians know, that if bodies, containing different quantities of matter, are successively impelled through the same space by the same power acting with a determined force at each point of that space; then the velocities given to these different bodies will be reciprocally in the subduplicate ratio of their quantities of matter. The excess of the velocities of the two and three bullets above what they ought to have been by this rule (which are that of 1200 and 980 feet in a second), undoubtedly arises from the flame, which, escaping by the side of the first bullet, acts on the surface of the second and third.\n\n\"Now, this excess has in many experiments been imperceptible, and the velocities have been reciprocally in the subduplicate ratios of the number of bullets, to sufficient exactness; and where this error has been greater, it has never arisen to an eighth part of the whole; but if the common opinion was true, that a small part only of the powder fires at first, and other parts of it successively as the bullet passes through the barrel, and that a considerable part of it is often blown out of the piece without firing at all; then the velocity which three bullets received from the explosion ought to have been much greater than we have found it to be.—But the truth of the second postulate more fully appears from those experiments, by which it is shown, that the velocities of bullets may be ascertained to the same exactness when they are acted on through a barrel of four inches in length only, as when they are discharged from one of four feet.\n\n\"With respect to the grains of powder which are often blown out unfired, and which are always urged as a proof of the gradual firing of the charge, I believe Diego Uffano, a person of great experience in the art of gunnery, has given the true reason for this accident; which is, that some small part of the charge is often not rammed up with the rest, but is left in the piece before the wad, and is by this means expelled by the blast of air before the fire can reach it. I must add, that in the charging of cannon and small arms, especially after the first time, this is scarcely to be avoided by any method I have yet seen practised. Perhaps, too, there may be some few grains in the best powder, of such an heterogeneous composition as to be less susceptible of firing; which, I think, I have myself observed; and these, though they are surrounded by the flame, may be driven out unfired.\n\n\"The following demonstration shows why some powder is often blown out unfired, and which are always urged as a proof of the gradual firing of the charge. Suppose the ball that is to be impelled to lie with its hinder surface at the line GE; then the force exerted at the explosion on the circle of which GE is the diameter, or, which is the same thing, the force exerted in the direction FB on the surface of the ball, is easily known from the known dimensions of that circle. Draw any line FH perpendicular to FB, and AI parallel to FH; and through the point H, the asymptotes IA and AB, describe the hyperbola KHNQ: then, if FH represents the force impelling the ball at the point F, the force impelling the ball at any other point as at M, will be represented by the line MN, the ordinate to the hyperbola at that point. For when the fluid impelling the body along has dilated itself to M, its density will be then to its original density in the space DEGC reciprocally as the spaces through which it is extended; that is, as FA to MA, or as MN to FH; but it has been shown, that the impelling force or elasticity of this fluid is directly as its density; therefore, if FH represents the force at the point F, MN will represent the like force at the point M.\n\n\"Since the absolute quantity of the force impelling the ball at the point F is known, and the weight of the ball is also known, the proportion between the force with which the ball is impelled and its own gravity is known. In this proportion take FH to FL, and draw LP parallel to FB; then, MN the ordinate to the hyperbola in any point will be to its part MR, cut off by the line LP, as the impelling force of the powder in that point M to the gravity of the ball; and consequently the line LP will determine a line proportional to the uniform force of gravity in every point; whilst the hyperbola HNQ determines in like manner such ordinates as are proportional to the impelling force of the powder in every point; whence by the\n39th Prop. of lib. i. of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia, the areas FLPB and FHQB in the duplicate proportion of the velocities which the ball would acquire when acted upon by its own gravity through the space FB, and when impelled through the same space by the force of the powder. But since the ratio of AF to AB and the ratio of FH to FL are known, the ratio of the area FLPB to the area FHQB is known; and thence its subduplicate. And since the line FB is given in magnitude, the velocity which a heavy body would acquire when impelled through this line by its own gravity is known; being no other than the velocity it would acquire by falling through a space equal to that line: find then another velocity to which this last mentioned velocity bears the given ratio of the subduplicate of the area FLPB to the area FHQB; and this velocity thus found is the velocity the ball will acquire when impelled through the space FB by the action of the inflamed powder.\n\n\"Now to give an example of this: Let us suppose AB, the length of the cylinder, to be 45 inches, its diameter DC, or rather the diameter of the ball, to be 1/8ths of an inch; and AF, the extent of the powder, to be 2 1/8 inches; to determine the velocity which will be communicated to a leaden bullet by the explosion, supposing the bullet to be laid at first with its surface contiguous to the powder.\n\n\"By the theory we have laid down, it appears, that at the first instant of the explosion the flame will exert, on the bullet lying close to it, a force 1000 times greater than the prelude of the atmosphere. The medium prelude of the atmosphere is reckoned equal to a column of water 33 feet in height; whence, lead being to water as 11,345 to 1, this prelude will be equal to that of a column of lead 34.9 inches in height. Multiplying this by 1000, therefore, a column of lead 34,900 inches (upwards of half a mile) in height, would produce a prelude on the bullet equal to what is exerted by the powder in the first instant of the explosion; and the leaden ball being 1/8ths of an inch in diameter, and consequently equal to a cylinder of lead of the same base half an inch in height, the prelude at first acting on it will be equal to 34900 x 2, or 69800 times its weight: whence FL to FH is as 1 to 69800; and FB to FA as 45—2 1/8, or 42 1/8 to 2 1/8, that is, as 339 to 21; whence the rectangle FLPB is to the rectangle AFHS as 339 to 21 x 69800, that is, as 1 to 4324.—And from the known application of the logarithms to the mensuration of the hyperbolic spaces it follows, that the rectangle AFHS is to the area FHQB as 43,429, &c., is to the tabular logarithm of \\(\\frac{AB}{AF}\\); that is, of \\(3^{1/2}\\), which is 1,2340579; whence the ratio of the rectangle FLPB to the hyperbolic area FHQB is compounded of the ratios of 1 to 4324—and of 43429, &c. to 1,2340579; which together make up the ratio of 1 to 12263, the subduplicate of which is the ratio of 1 to 110,7; and in this ratio is the velocity which the bullet would acquire by gravity in falling through a space equal to FB, to the velocity the bullet will acquire from the action of the powder impelling it through FB. But the space FB being 42 1/8 inches, the velocity a heavy body will acquire in falling through such a space is known to be what would carry it nearly at the rate of 15.07 feet in a second; whence the velocity to which this has the ratio of 1 to 110,7 is a velocity which would carry the bullet at the rate of 1668 feet in one second. And this is the velocity which, according to the theory, the bullet in the present circumstances would acquire from the action of the powder during the time of its dilatation.\n\n\"Now this velocity being once computed for one case, is easily applied to any other; for if the cavity DEGC left behind the bullet be only in part filled with powder, then the line HF, and consequently the area FHQB will be diminished in the proportion of the whole cavity to the part filled. If the diameter of the bore be varied, the lengths AB and AF remaining the same, then the quantity of powder and the surface of the bullet which it acts on, will be varied in the duplicate proportion of the diameter, but the weight of the bullet will vary in the triplicate proportion of the diameter; wherefore the line FH, which is directly as the absolute impelling force of the powder, and reciprocally as the gravity of the bullet, will change in the reciprocal proportion of the diameter of the bullet. If AF, the height of the cavity left behind the bullet, be increased or diminished, the rectangle of the hyperbola, and consequently the area corresponding to ordinates in any given ratio, will be increased or diminished in the same proportion. From all which it follows, that the area FHQB, which is in the duplicate proportion of the velocity of the impelled body, will be directly as the logarithm \\(\\frac{AB}{AF}\\) (where AB represents the length of the barrel, and AF the length of the cavity left behind the bullet); also directly as the part of that cavity filled with powder; and inversely, as the diameter of the bore, or rather of the bullet, likewise directly as AF, the height of the cavity left behind the bullet. Consequently the velocity being computed as above, for a bullet of a determined diameter, placed in a piece of a given length, and impelled by a given quantity of powder, occupying a given cavity behind that bullet; it follows, that by means of these ratios, the velocity of any other bullet may be thence deduced; the necessary circumstances of its position, quantity of powder, &c. being given. Where note, That in the instance of this supposition, we have supposed the diameter of the ball to be 1/8ths of an inch; whence the diameter of the bore will be something more, and the quantity of powder contained in the space DEGC will amount exactly to 12 pennyweights, a small wad of tow included.\n\n\"In order to compare the velocities communicated to bullets by the explosion, with the velocities resulting from the theory by computation, it is necessary that the actual velocities with which bullets move should be discovered. The only methods hitherto practised for this purpose, have been either by observing the time of the flight of a shot through a given space, or by measuring the range of a shot at a given elevation; and thence computing, on the parabolic hypothesis, what degree of velocity would produce this range.—The first method labours under this insurmountable difficulty, that the velocities of these bodies are often so swift, and consequently the time observed is so short, that an imperceptible error in that time may occasion...\"\nTheory. occasion an error in the velocity thus found of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 600 feet, in a second. The other method is to fallacious, by reason of the refinance of the atmosphere (to which inequality the first is also liable), that the velocities thus assigned may not perhaps be the tenth part of the actual velocities fought.\n\nThe simplest method of determining this velocity is by means of the instrument represented fig. 2, where ABCD represents the body of the machine composed of the three poles B, C, D, spreading at bottom, and joining together at the top A; being the same with what is vulgarly used in lifting and weighing very heavy bodies, and is called by workmen the triangles. On two of these poles, towards their tops, are screwed on the sockets RS; and on these sockets the pendulum EFGHIK is hung by means of its cross-piece EF, which becomes its axis of suspension, and on which it must be made to vibrate with great freedom. The body of this pendulum is made of iron, having a broad part at bottom, and its lower part is covered with a thick piece of wood GHIK, which is fastened to the iron by screws. Something lower than the bottom of the pendulum there is a brace OP, joining the two poles from which the pendulum is suspended; and to this brace there is fastened a contrivance MNU, made with two edges of steel, bearing on each other in the line UN, something in the manner of a drawing-pen; the strength with which these edges press on each other being diminished or increased at pleasure by means of a screw Z going through the upper piece. There is fastened to the bottom of the pendulum a narrow ribbon LN, which passes between these steel edges, and which afterwards, by means of an opening cut in the lower piece of steel, hangs loosely down, as at W.\n\nThis instrument thus fitted, if the weight of the pendulum be known, and likewise the respective distances of its centre of gravity, and of its centre of oscillation from its axis of suspension, it will thence be known what motion will be communicated to this pendulum by the percussion of a body of a known weight moving with a known degree of celerity, and striking it in a given point; that is, if the pendulum be supposed at rest before the percussion, it will be known what vibration it ought to make in consequence of such a determined blow; and, on the contrary, if the pendulum, being at rest, is struck by a body of a known weight, and the vibration which the pendulum makes after the blow is known, the velocity of the striking body may from thence be determined.\n\nHence then, if a bullet of a known weight strikes the pendulum, and the vibration, which the pendulum makes in consequence of the stroke, be ascertained; the velocity with which the ball moved is thence to be known.\n\nNow the extent of the vibration made by the pendulum after the blow, may be measured to great accuracy by the ribbon LN. For let the prelude of the edges UN on the ribbon be so regulated by the screw Z, that the motion of the ribbon between them may be free and easy, though with some minute resistance; then settling the pendulum at rest, let the part LN between the pendulum and the edges be drawn straight, but not strained, and fix a pin in that part of the ribbon which is then contiguous to the edges: let now a ball impinge on the pendulum; then the pendulum swinging back will draw out the ribbon to the just extent of its vibration, which will consequently be determined by the interval on the ribbon between the edges UN and the place of the pin.\n\nThe weight of the whole pendulum, wood and all was 56 lb. 3 oz. its centre of gravity was 52 inches distant from its axis of suspension, and 200 of its small twangs were performed in the time of 23 seconds; whence its centre of oscillation (determined from hence) is 62½ inches distant from that axis. The centre of the piece of wood GHIK is distant from the same axis 66 inches.\n\nIn the compound ratio of 66 to 62½ and 66 to 52, take the quantity of matter of the pendulum to a 4th quantity, which will be 42 lb. ¼ oz. Now geometers will know, that if the blow be struck on the centre of the piece of wood GHIK, the pendulum will resist to the stroke in the same manner as if this last quantity of matter only (42 lb. ¼ oz.) was concentrated in that point, and the rest of the pendulum was taken away; whence, supposing the weight of the bullet impinging in that point to be the ¼ of a pound, or the ¼ of this quantity of matter nearly, the velocity of the point of oscillation after the stroke will, by the laws observed in the congress of such bodies as rebound not from each other, be the ¼ of the velocity the bullet moved with before the stroke; whence the velocity of this point of oscillation after the stroke being ascertained, that multiplied by 505 will give the velocity with which the ball impinged.\n\nBut the velocity of the point of oscillation after the stroke is easily deduced from the chord of the arch, through which it ascends by the blow; for it is a well-known proposition, that all pendulous bodies ascend to the same height by their vibratory motion as they would do, if they were projected directly upwards from their lowest point, with the same velocity they have in that point; wherefore, if the verified fine of the ascending arch be found (which is easily determined from the chord and radius being given), this verified fine is the perpendicular height to which a body projected upwards with the velocity of the point of oscillation would arise; and consequently what that velocity is, can be easily computed by the common theory of falling bodies.\n\nFor instance, the chord of the arch, described by the ascent of the pendulum after the stroke measured on the ribbon, has been sometimes 17½ inches; the distance of the ribbon from the axis of suspension is 7½ inches; whence reducing 17½ in the ratio of 7½ to 66, the resulting number, which is nearly 16 inches, will be the chord of the arch through which the centre of the board GHIK ascended after the stroke; now the verified fine of the arch, whose chord is 16 inches, and its radius 66, is 1.03939; and the velocity which would carry a body to this height, or, which is the same thing, the velocity which a body would acquire by descending through this space, is nearly that of 3½ feet in 1\".\n\nTo determine then the velocity with which the bullet impinged on the centre of the wood, when the chord of the arch described by the ascent of the pendulum, in consequence of the blow, was 17½ inches measured on the ribbon, no more is necessary than to multiply\nTheory, multiply \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)th by 505, and the resulting number 1641 will be the feet which the bullet would describe in \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th if it moved with the velocity it had at the moment of its percussion; for the velocity of the point of the pendulum, on which the bullet struck, we have just now determined to be that of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)th feet in \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th; and we have before shown, that this is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)th of the velocity of the bullet. If then a bullet weighing \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th of a pound strikes the pendulum in the centre of the wood GKIH, and the ribbon be drawn out \\( \\frac{17}{4} \\)th inches by the blow; the velocity of the bullet is that of 1641 feet in \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th. And since the length the ribbon is drawn is always nearly the chord of the arch described by the ascent, (it being placed so as to differ infensibly from those chords which most frequently occur), and these chords are known to be in the proportion of the velocities of the pendulum acquired from the stroke; it follows, that the proportion between the lengths of ribbon drawn out at different times, will be the same with that of the velocities of the impinging bullets; and consequently, by the proportion of these lengths of ribbon to \\( \\frac{17}{4} \\)th, the proportion of the velocity with which the bullets impinge, to the known velocity of 1641 feet in \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th, will be determined.\n\n\"Hence then is shown in general how the velocities of bullets of all kinds may be found out by means of this instrument; but that those who may be disposed to try these experiments may not have unforeseen difficulties to struggle with, we shall here subjoin a few observations, which it will be necessary for them to attend to, both to secure success to their trials and safety to their persons.\n\n\"And first, that they may not conceive the piece of wood GKIH to be an unnecessary part of the machine, we must inform them, that if a bullet impelled by a full charge of powder should strike directly on the iron, the bullet would be beaten into shivers by the stroke, and these shivers would rebound back with such violence, as to bury themselves in any wood they chanced to light on, as I have found by hazardous experience; and besides the danger, the pendulum will not in this instance ascertain the velocity of the bullet, because the velocity with which the parts of it rebound is unknown.\n\n\"The weight of the pendulum, and the thickness of the wood, must be in some measure proportioned to the size of the bullets which are used. A pendulum of the weight here described will do very well for all bullets under three or four ounces, if the thickness of the board be increased to seven or eight inches for the heaviest bullets; beech is the toughest and properest wood for this purpose.\n\n\"It is hazardous standing on the side of the pendulum, unless the board be so thick, that the greatest part of the bullet's force is lost before it comes at the iron; for if it strikes the iron with violence, the shivers of lead, which cannot return back through the wood, will force themselves out between the wood and iron, and will fly to a considerable distance.\n\n\"As there is no effectual way of fastening the wood to the iron but by screws, the heads of which must come through the board; the bullets will sometimes light on those screws, from whence the shivers will disperse themselves on every side.\n\n\"When in these experiments so small a quantity of powder is used, as will not give to the bullet a velocity of more than 400 or 500 feet in \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th; the bullet will not stick in the wood, but will rebound from it entirely, and (if the wood be of a very hard texture) with a very considerable velocity. Indeed I have never examined any of the bullets which have thus rebounded, but I have found them indented by the bodies they have struck against in their rebound.\n\n\"To avoid then these dangers, to the braving of which in philosophical researches no honour is annexed; it will be convenient to fix whatsoever barrel is used, on a strong heavy carriage, and to fire it with a little slow match. Let the barrel too be very well fortified in all its length; for no barrel (I speak of musket barrels) forged with the usual dimensions will bear many of the experiments without bursting. The barrel I have most relied on, and which I procured to be made on purpose, is nearly as thick at the muzzle as at the breech; that is, it has in each place nearly the diameter of its bore in thickness of metal.\n\n\"The powder used in these experiments should be exactly weighed; and that no part of it be scattered in the barrel, the piece must be charged with a ladle in the same manner as is practised with cannon; the wad should be of tow, of the same weight each time, and no more than is just necessary to confine the powder in its proper place: the length of the cavity left behind the ball should be determined each time with exactness; for the increasing or diminishing that space will vary the velocity of the shot, although the bullet and quantity of powder be not changed. The distance of the mouth of the piece from the pendulum ought to be such, that the impulse of the flame may not act on the pendulum; this will be prevented in a common barrel charged with half an ounce of powder, if it be at the distance of 16 or 18 feet; in larger charges the impulse is sensible farther off; I have found it to extend to above 25 feet; however, between 25 and 18 feet is the distance I have usually chosen.\"\n\nWith this instrument, or others similar to it, Mr Account of Robins made a great number of experiments on bar. Mr Robins's experiments, and having compared the actual velocities with the computed ones, his theory appears to have come as near the truth as could well be expected. In seven of the experiments there was a perfect coincidence; the charges of powder being six or twelve pennyweights; the barrels 45, 24, 31, 2, and 7.06 inches in length. The diameter of the first (marked A) was \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)ths of an inch; of the second (B) was the same; and of D, \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) of an inch. In the first of these experiments, another barrel (C) was used, whose length was 12.375 inches, and the diameter of its bore \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)th inch.—In 14 more of the experiments, the difference between the length of the chord of the pendulum's arch thrown by the theory and the actual experiment was \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of an inch over or under. This showed an error in the theory varying according to the different lengths of the chord from \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of the whole; the charges of powder were the same as in the last.—In 16 other experiments the error was \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\)ths of an inch, varying from \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of the whole; the charges of powder were 6, 8, 9, or 12 pennyweights.—In seven other experiments, the error was \\( \\frac{3}{10} \\)ths of an inch, varying from \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\)th of\nSect. II.\n\nGUNNERY.\n\nTheory. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the whole; the charges of powder six or twelve pennyweights. In eight experiments, the difference was \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths of an inch, indicating an error from \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the whole; the charges being 6, 9, 12, and 21 pennyweights of powder. In three experiments, the error was \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths, varying from \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)th to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of the whole; the charges 8 and 12 pennyweights of powder. In two experiments, the error was \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths, in one case amounting to something less than \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\), in the other to \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of the whole; the charges 12 and 36 pennyweights of powder. By one experiment the error was seven, and by another eight, tenths; the first amounting to \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) nearly, the latter to almost \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)th of the whole; the charges of powder 6 or 12 pennyweights. The last error however, Mr Robins attributes to the wind. The two remaining experiments varied from theory by \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) inches, somewhat more than \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)th of the whole; the charges of powder were 12 pennyweights in each; and Mr Robins attributes the error to the dampness of the powder. In another case, he attributes an error of \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths to the blast of the powder on the pendulum.\n\nFrom these experiments Mr Robins deduces the following conclusions. \"The variety of these experiments, and the accuracy with which they correspond to the theory, leave us no room to doubt of its certainty. This theory, as here established, supposes, that, in the firing of gunpowder, about \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths of its substance is converted by the sudden inflammation into a permanently elastic fluid, whose elasticity, in proportion to its heat and density, is the same with that of common air in the like circumstances; it farther supposes, that all the force exerted by gunpowder in its most violent operations, is no more than the action of the elasticity of the fluid thus generated; and these principles enable us to determine the velocities of bullets impelled from fire-arms of all kinds; and are fully sufficient for all purposes where the force of gunpowder is to be estimated.\n\nFrom this theory many deductions may be made of the greatest consequence to the practical part of gunnery. From hence the thickness of a piece, which will enable it to confine, without bursting, any given charge of powder, is easily determined, since the effort of the powder is known. From hence appears the inconclusiveness of some modern authors who have advanced, relating to the advantages of particular forms of chambers for mortars and cannon; for all their laboured speculations on this head are evidently founded on very erroneous opinions about the action of fixed powder. From this theory too we are taught the necessity of leaving the same space behind the bullet, when we would, by the same quantity of powder, communicate to it an equal degree of velocity; since, on the principles already laid down, it follows, that the same powder has a greater or less degree of elasticity, according to the different spaces it occupies. The method which I have always practised for this purpose has been by marking the rammer; and this is a maxim which ought not to be dispensed with when cannon are fired at an elevation, particularly in those called by the French batteries à ricochet.\n\nFrom the continued action of the powder, and its manner of expanding described in this theory, and the length and weight of the piece, one of the most essential circumstances in the well directing of artillery may be easily ascertained. All practitioners are agreed, that no shot can be depended on, unless the piece be placed on a solid platform: for if the platform shakes with the first impulse of the powder, it is impossible but the piece must also shake: which will alter its direction, and render the shot uncertain. To prevent this accident, the platform is usually made extremely firm to a considerable depth backwards; so that the piece is not only well supported in the beginning of its motion, but likewise through a great part of its recoil. However, it is sufficiently obvious, that when the bullet is separated from the piece, it can be no longer affected by the trembling of the piece or platform; and, by a very easy computation, it will be found, that the bullet will be out of the piece before the latter hath recoiled half an inch: whence, if the platform be sufficiently solid at the beginning of the recoil, the remaining part of it may be much lighter; and hence a more compendious method of constructing platforms may be found out.\n\n\"From this theory also it appears how greatly these authors have been mistaken, who have attributed the force of gunpowder, or at least a considerable part of it, to the action of the air contained either in the powder or between the intervals of the grains; for they have supposed that air to exist in its natural elastic state, and to receive all its addition of force from the heat of the explosion. But from what hath been already delivered concerning the increase of the air's elasticity by heat, we may conclude that the heat of the explosion cannot augment this elasticity to five times its common quantity; consequently the force arising from this cause only cannot amount to more than the 200th part of the real force exerted on the occasion.\n\n\"If the whole substance of the powder was converted into an elastic fluid at the instant of the explosion, then from the known elasticity of this fluid assigned by our theory, and its known density, we could easily determine the velocity with which it would begin to expand, and could thence trace out its future augmentations in its progress through the barrel: but as we have shown that the elastic fluid, in which the activity of the gunpowder consists, is only \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\)ths of the substance of the powder, the remaining \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\)ths will, in the explosion, be mixed with the elastic part, and will by its weight retard the activity of the explosion: and yet they will not be so completely united as to move with one common motion; but the unelastic part will be less accelerated than the rest, and some will not even be carried out of the barrel, as appears by the considerable quantity of unctuous matter which adheres to the inside of all fire-arms after they have been used. These inequalities in the expansive motion of the flame oblige us to recur to experiments for its accurate determination.\n\n\"The experiments made use of for this purpose were of two kinds. The first was made by charging the barrel A with 12 pennyweights of powder, and raising the small wad of tow only; and then placing its mouth velocity of 19 inches from the centre of the pendulum. On firing fired gun, it in this situation, the impulse of the flame made it powder ascend through an arch whose chord was 137 inches; whence, if the whole substance of the powder was supposed...\nsupposed to strike against the pendulum, and each part to strike with the same velocity, that common velocity must have been at the rate of about 265 feet in a second.—But as some part of the velocity of the flame was lost in passing through 19 inches of air; I made the remaining experiments in a manner not liable to this inconvenience.\n\n\"I fixed the barrel A on the pendulum, so that its axis might be both horizontal and also perpendicular to the plane HK; or, which is the same thing, that it might be in the plane of the pendulum's vibration: the height of the axis of the piece above the centre of the pendulum was fix inches; and the weight of the piece, and of the iron that fastened it, &c. was 12½ lb. The barrel in this situation being charged with 12 pennyweights of powder, without either ball or wad, only put together with the rammer; on the discharge the pendulum ascended through an arch whose chord was 10 inches, or reduced to an equivalent blow in the centre of the pendulum, supposing the barrel away, it would be 14.4 inches nearly.—The same experiment being repeated, the chord of the ascending arch was 10.1 inches, which, reduced to the centre, is 14.6 inches.\n\n\"To determine what difference of velocity there was in the different parts of the vapour, I loaded the piece again with 12 pennyweights of powder, and rammed it down with a wad of tow, weighing one pennyweight. Now, I conceived that this wad being very light, would presently acquire that velocity with which the elastic part of the fluid would expand itself when uncompressed; and I accordingly found, that the chord of the ascending arch was by this means increased to 12 inches, or at the centre to 17.3: whence, as the medium of the other two experiments is 14.5, the pendulum ascended through an arch 2.8 inches longer, by the additional motion of one pennyweight of matter, moving with the velocity of the swiftest part of the vapour; and consequently the velocity with which this pennyweight of matter moved, was that of about 7000 feet in a second.\n\n\"It will perhaps be objected to this determination, that the augmentation of the arch through which the pendulum vibrated in this case was not all of it owing to the quantity of motion given to the wad, but part of it was produced by the confinement of the powder, and the greater quantity thereby fired. But if it were true that a part only of the powder fired when there was no wad, it would not happen that in firing different quantities of powder without a wad, the chord would increase and decrease nearly in the ratio of these quantities; which yet I have found it to do: for with nine pennyweights that chord was 7.3 inches, which with 12 pennyweights we have seen was only 10, and 10.1 inches; and even with three pennyweights the chord was two inches; deficient from this proportion by .5 only; for which defect two other valid reasons are to be assigned.\n\n\"And there is still a more convincing proof that all the powder is fired, although no wad be placed before the charge, which is, that the part of the recoil arising from the expansion of powder alone is found to be no greater when it impels a leaden bullet before it, than when the same quantity is fired without any wad to confine it. We have seen that the chord of the arch through which the pendulum rose from the expansive force of the powder alone is 10, or 10.1; and the chord of that arch, when the piece was charged in the customary manner with a bullet and wad, I found to be the first time 22½, and the second 22¾, or at a medium 22.56. Now the impulse of the ball and wad, if they were supposed to strike the pendulum in the same place in which the barrel was suspended, with the velocity they had acquired at the mouth of the piece, would drive it through an arch whose chord would be about 12.3; as is known from the weight of the pendulum, the weight and position of the barrel, and the velocity of the bullet determined by our former experiments; whence, subtracting this number 12.3 from 22.56, the remainder 10.26 is nearly the chord of the arch which the pendulum would have ascended through from the expansion of the powder alone with a bullet laid before it. And this number, 10.26, differs but little from 10.1, which we have above found to be the chord of the ascending arch, when the same quantity of powder expanded itself freely without either bullet or wad before it.\n\n\"Again, that this velocity of 7000 feet in a second is not much beyond what the most active part of the flame acquires in expanding, is evinced from hence, that in some experiments a ball has been found to be discharged with a velocity of 2400 feet in a second; and yet it appeared not that the action of the powder was at all diminished on account of this immense velocity: consequently the degree of swiftness with which, in this instance, the powder followed the ball without losing any part of its prelude, must have been much short of what the powder alone would have expanded with, had not the ball been there.\n\n\"From these determinations may be deduced the force of petards; since their action depends entirely on the impulse of the flame; and it appears that a quantity of powder properly disposed in such a machine, may produce as violent an effort as a bullet of twice its weight, moving with a velocity of 1400 or 1500 feet in a second.\n\n\"In many of the experiments already recited, the bullet ball was not laid immediately contiguous to the powder, but at a small distance, amounting, at the utmost, to only an inch and a half. In these cases the velocity when theory agreed very well with the experiments. But laid at a distance if a bullet is placed at a greater distance from the flame from powder, suppose at 12, 18, or 24 inches, we cannot derive then apply to this ball the same principles which may be applied to those laid in contact, or nearly so, with the powder; for when the surface of the fired powder is not confined by a heavy body, the flame dilates itself with a velocity far exceeding that which it can communicate to a bullet by its continued prelude: consequently, as at the distance of 12, 18, or 24 inches, the powder will have acquired a considerable degree of this velocity of expansion, the first motion of the ball will not be produced by the continued prelude of the powder, but by the actual percussion of the flame; and it will therefore begin to move with a quantity of motion proportioned to the quantity of this flame, and the velocities of its respective parts.\n\n\"From hence then it follows, that the velocity of the bullet, laid at a considerable distance before the charge,\nSect. II.\n\nGUNNERY.\n\nTheory. charge, ought to be greater than what would be communicated to it by the pressure of the powder acting in the manner already mentioned; and this deduction from our theory we have confirmed by manifold experience; by which we have found, that a ball laid in the barrel A, with its hinder part 11½ inches from its breech, and impelled by 12 pennyweights of powder, has acquired a velocity of about 1400 feet in a second; when, if it had been acted on by the pressure of the flame only, it would not have acquired a velocity of 1200 feet in a second. The same we have found to hold true in all other greater distances (and also in lesser, though not in the same degree), and in all quantities of powder: and we have likewise found, that these effects nearly correspond with what has been already laid down about the velocity of expansion and the elastic and unelastic parts of the flame.\n\n\"From hence too arises another consideration of great consequence in the practice of gunnery; which is, that no bullet should at any time be placed at a considerable distance before the charge, unless the piece is extremely well fortified: for a moderate charge of powder, when it has expanded itself through the vacant space, and reaches the ball, will, by the velocity each part has acquired, accumulate itself behind the ball, and thereby be condensed prodigiously; whence, if the barrel be not extremely firm in that part, it must, by means of this reinforced elasticity, infallibly burst. The truth of this reasoning I have experienced in an exceeding good Tower-musket, forged of very tough iron; for charging it with 12 pennyweights of powder, and placing the ball 16 inches from the breech, on firing it, the part of the barrel just behind the bullet was swelled out to double its diameter like a blown bladder, and two large pieces of two inches long were burst out of it.\n\n\"Having seen that the entire motion of a bullet laid at a considerable distance from the charge, is acquired by two different methods in which the powder acts on it; the first being the percussion of the parts of the flame with the velocity they had respectively acquired by expanding, the second the continued pressure of the flame through the remaining part of the barrel; I endeavoured to separate these different actions, and to retain that only which arose from the continued pressure of the flame. For this purpose I no longer placed the powder at the breech, from whence it would have full scope for its expansion; but I scattered it as uniformly as I could through the whole cavity left behind the bullet; imagining that by this means the progressive velocity of the flame in each part would be prevented by the expansion of the neighbouring parts; and I found, that the ball being laid 11½ inches from the breech, its velocity, instead of 1400 feet in a second, which it acquired in the last experiments, was now no more than 1100 feet in the second, which is 100 feet short of what according to the theory should arise from the continued pressure of the powder only.\n\n\"The reason of this deficiency was, doubtless, the intestine motion of the flame: for the ascension of the powder thus distributed through so much larger a space than it could fill, must have produced many reverberations and pulsations of the flame; and from these internal agitations of the fluid, its pressure on the containing surface will (as is the case of all other fluids) be considerably diminished; and in order to avoid this irregularity, in all other experiments I took care to have the powder closely confined in as small a space as possible, even when the bullet lay at some little distance from it.\n\n\"With regard to the resistance of the air, which so remarkably affects all military projectiles, it is necessary to premise, that the greatest part of authors have assumed the air to be a certain rule, that while the same body of bullets moves in the same medium, it is always resisted in the duplicate proportion of its velocity; that is, if the resisting body move in one part of its track with three times the velocity with which it moved in some other part, then its resistance to the greater velocity will be nine times the resistance to the lesser. If the velocity in one place be four times greater than in another, the resistance of the fluid will be 16 times greater in the first than in the second, &c. This rule, however, though pretty near the truth when the velocities are confused within certain limits, is excessively erroneous when applied to military projectiles, where such resistances often occur as could scarcely be effected, on the commonly received principles, even by a treble augmentation of its density.\n\n\"By means of the machine already described, I have it in my power to determine the velocity with which a ball moves in any part of its track, provided I can direct the piece in such a manner as to cause the bullet to impinge on the pendulum placed in that part: and therefore, charging a musket barrel three times successively with a leaden ball three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and about half its weight of powder; and taking such precaution in weighing of the powder and placing it, that I was assured, by many previous trials, that the velocity of the ball could not differ by 20 feet in a second from its medium quantity; I fired it against the pendulum placed at 25, 75, and 125 feet distance from the mouth of the piece respectively; and I found that it impinged against the pendulum, in the first case, with a velocity of 1670 feet in a second; in the second case, with a velocity of 1550 feet in a second; and in the third case, with a velocity of 1425 feet in a second; so that, in passing through 50 feet of air, the bullet lost a velocity of 120 or 125 feet in a second; and the time of its passing through that space being about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) of a second, the medium quantity of resistance must, in these instances, have been about 120 times the weight of the ball; which (as the ball was nearly \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a pound) amounts to about 10lb. avoirdupois.\n\n\"Now, if a computation be made according to the method laid down for compressed fluids in the 38th proposition of Newton's Principia, supposing the weight of water to that of air as 850 to 1, it will be found, that the resistance to a globe of three-fourths of an inch diameter, moving with a velocity of about 1600 feet in a second, will not, on these principles, amount to any more than 4½lb. avoirdupois; whence, as we know that the rules contained in that proposition are very accurate with regard to flow motions, we may hence conclude, that the resistance of the air in flow motions is less than that in swift motions, in the ratio of 4½ to 10; a proportion between that of 1 to 2, and 1 to 3.\n\n\"Again, I charged the same piece a number of times with equal quantities of powder, and balls of the same weight, taking all possible care to give to every\nevery shot an equal velocity; and, firing three times against the pendulum placed only 25 feet from the mouth of the piece, the medium of the velocities with which the ball impinged was nearly that of 1690 feet in a second: then removing the piece 175 feet from the pendulum, I found, taking the medium of five shots, that the velocity with which the ball impinged at this distance was 1300 feet in a second; whence the ball, in passing through 150 feet of air, lost a velocity of about 390 feet in a second; and the resistance computed from these numbers comes out something more than in the preceding instance, it amounting here to between 11 and 12 pounds avoirdupois; whence, according to these experiments, the resisting power of the air to swift motions is greater than to slow ones, in a ratio which approaches nearer to that of 3 to 1 than in the preceding experiments.\n\nHaving thus examined the resistance to a velocity of 1700 feet in a second, I next examined the resistance to smaller velocities; and for this purpose, I charged the same barrel with balls of the same diameter, but with less powder, and placing the pendulum at 25 feet distance from the piece, I fired against it five times with an equal charge each time: the medium velocity with which the ball impinged, was that of 1180 feet in a second; then, removing the pendulum to the distance of 250 feet, the medium velocity of five shots, made at this distance, was that of 950 feet in a second; whence the ball, in passing through 225 feet of air, lost a velocity of 230 feet in a second: and as it passed through that interval in about \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of a second, the resistance to the middle velocity will come out to be near \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) times the gravity of the ball, or 2 lb. 1 oz. avoirdupois. Now, the resistance to the same velocity, according to the laws observed in slower motions, amounts to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the same quantity; whence, in a velocity of 1065 feet in a second, the resisting power of the air is augmented in no greater a proportion than that of 7 to 11; whereas we have seen in the former experiments, that to still greater degrees of velocity the augmentation approached very near the ratio of one to three.\n\nBut farther, I fired three shot, of the same size and weight with those already mentioned, over a large piece of water; so that their dropping into the water being very discernible, both the distance and time of their flight might be accurately ascertained. Each shot was discharged with a velocity of 400 feet in a second; and I had satisfied myself by many previous trials of the same charge with the pendulum, that I could rely on this velocity to ten feet in a second. The first shot flew 313 yards in four seconds and a quarter, the second flew 319 yards in four seconds, and the third 373 yards in five seconds and a half. According to the theory of resistance established for slow motions, the first shot ought to have spent no more than 3.2 seconds in its flight, the second 3.28, and the third 4 seconds; whence it is evident, that every shot was retarded considerably more than it ought to have been had that theory taken place in its motion; consequently the resistance of the air is very sensibly increased, even in such a small velocity as that of 400 feet in a second.\n\nAs no large shot are ever projected in practice with velocities exceeding that of 1700 feet in a second, it will be sufficient for the purposes of a practical gunner to determine the resistance to all lesser velocities; which may be thus exhibited. Let \\( AB \\) be taken to \\( AC \\), in the ratio of 1700 feet in a second to the given velocity to which the resisting power of the air is required. Continue the line \\( AB \\) to \\( D \\), so that \\( BD \\) may be to \\( AD \\), as the resisting power of the air to flow motions is to its resisting power to a velocity of 1700 feet in a second; then shall \\( CD \\) be to \\( AD \\) as the resisting power of the air to flow motions is to its resisting power to the given velocity represented by \\( AC \\).\n\nFrom the computations and experiments already mentioned, it plainly appears, that a leaden ball of three-fourths of an inch diameter, and weighing nearly 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) oz. avoirdupois, if it be fired from a barrel of 45 inches in length, with half its weight of powder, will issue from that piece with a velocity which, if it were uniformly continued, would carry it near 1700 feet in a second.—If, instead of a leaden ball, an iron one, of an equal diameter, was placed in the same situation in the same piece, and was impelled by an equal quantity of powder, the velocity of such an iron bullet would be greater than that of the leaden one in the subduplicate ratio of the specific gravities of lead and iron; and supposing that ratio to be as three to two, and computing on the principles already laid down, it will appear, that an iron bullet of 24 lb. weight, shot from a piece of 10 feet in length, with 16 lb. of powder, will acquire from the explosion a velocity which, if uniformly continued, would carry it nearly 1650 feet in a second.\n\nThis is the velocity which, according to our theory, a cannon-ball of 24 lb. weight is discharged with when it is impelled by a full charge of powder; but if, instead of a quantity of powder weighing two-thirds of the ball, we suppose the charge to be only half the weight of it, then its velocity will on the same principles be no more than 1490 feet in a second. The same would be the velocities of every lesser bullet fired with the same proportions of powder, if the lengths of all pieces were constantly in the same ratio with the diameters of their bore; and although, according to the usual dimensions of the smaller pieces of artillery, this proportion does not always hold, yet the difference is not great enough to occasion a very great variation from the velocities here assigned; as will be obvious to anyone who shall make a computation thereon. But in these determinations we suppose the windage to be no more than is just sufficient for putting down the bullet easily; whereas in real service, either through negligence or unskillfulness, it often happens, that the diameter of the bore so much exceeds the diameter of the bullet, that great part of the inflamed fluid escapes by its side; whence the velocity of the shot in this case may be considerably less than what we have assigned. However, this perhaps may be compensated by the greater heat which in all probability attends the firing of these large quantities of powder.\n\nFrom this great velocity of cannon shot we may Solution clear up the difficulty concerning the point-blank shot of the difficulty which occasioned the invention of Anderson's strange culty concerning hypothesis*. Here our author was deceived by his point-blank not knowing how greatly the primitive velocity of the heaviest shot is diminished in the course of its flight by * See No 5.\nTheory. the resistance of the air. And the received opinion of practical gunners is not more difficult to account for; since, when they agree that every shot flies in a straight line to a certain distance from the piece, which imaginary distance they have called the extent of the point-blank shot, we need only suppose, that, within that distance which they thus determine, the deviation of the path of the shot from a straight line is not very perceptible in their method of pointing. Now, as a shot of 24lb. fired with two-thirds of its weight of powder, will, at the distance of 100 yards from the piece, be separated from the line of its original direction by an angle of little more than half a degree; those who are acquainted with the inaccurate methods often used in the directing of cannon will easily allow, that so small an aberration may not be attended to by the generality of practitioners, and the path of the shot may consequently be deemed a straight line; especially as other causes of error will often intervene much greater than what arises from the incursion of this line by gravity.\n\nWe have now determined the velocity of the shot both when fired with two-thirds of its weight and with half its weight of powder respectively; and on this occasion I must remark, that on the principles of our theory, the increasing the charge of powder will increase the velocity of the shot till the powder arrives at a certain quantity; after which, if the powder be increased, the velocity of the shot will diminish. The quantity producing the greatest velocity, and the proportion between that greatest velocity and the velocity communicated by greater and lesser charges, may be thus assigned. Let AB represent the axis of the piece; draw AC perpendicular to it, and to the asymptotes AC and AB draw any hyperbola LF, and draw BF parallel to AC; find out now the point D, where the rectangle ADEG is equal to the hyperbolic area DEFB; then will AD represent that height of the charge which communicates the greatest velocity to the shot: whence AD being to AB as 1 to 2.71828, as appears from the table of logarithms, from the length of the line AD thus determined, and the diameter of the bore, the quantity of powder contained in this charge is easily known. If, instead of this charge, any other filling the cylinder to the height AI, be used, draw IH parallel to AC, and through the point H to the same asymptotes AC and AB describe the hyperbola HK; then the greatest velocity will be to the velocity communicated by the charge AI, in the subduplicate proportion of the rectangle ADEG to the same rectangle diminished by the trilinear space KHE.\n\nIt hath been already shown, that the resistance of the air on the surface of a bullet of three-fourths of an inch diameter, moving with a velocity of 1670 feet in a second, amounted to about 10lb. It hath also been shown, that an iron bullet weighing 24lb. if fired with 16lb. of powder (which is usually esteemed its proper battering charge), acquires a velocity of about 1650 feet in a second, scarcely differing from the other: whence, as the surface of this last bullet is more than 34 times greater than the surface of a bullet of three-fourths of an inch diameter, and their velocities are nearly the same, it follows, that the resistance on the larger bullet will amount to more than 540lb. which is near 23 times its own weight.\n\nThe two last propositions are principally aimed against those theorists who have generally agreed in supposing the flight of shot and shells to be nearly in the curve of a parabola. The reason given by those authors for their opinion is the supposed inconsiderable resistance of the air; since as it is agreed on all sides that the track of projectiles would be a perfect parabola if there was no resistance, it has from thence been too rashly concluded, that the interruption which the ponderous bodies of shells and bullets would receive from such a rare medium as air would be scarcely sensible, and consequently that their parabolic flight would be hereby scarcely affected.\n\nNow the prodigious resistance of the air to a bullet of 24lb. weight, such as we have here established it, sufficiently confutes this reasoning; for how erroneous must that hypothesis be, which neglects an inconsiderable force amounting to more than 20 times the weight of the moving body? But here it is necessary to allude a few particulars, the demonstrations of which, on the commonly received principles, may be seen under the article PROJECTILES.\n\n1. If the resistance of the air be so small that the common motion of a projected body is in the curve of a parabola, then the axis of that parabola will be perpendicular to the horizon, and consequently the part of the curve of projection in which the body ascends will be equal and similar to that in which it descends.\n\n2. If the parabola in which the body moves be terminated on a horizontal plane, then the vertex of the parabola will be equally distant from its own extremes.\n\n3. Also the moving body will fall on that horizontal plane in the same angle, and with the same velocity with which it was first projected.\n\n4. If a body be projected in different angles but with the same velocity, then its greatest horizontal range will be when it is projected in an angle of 45° with the horizon.\n\n5. If the velocity with which the body is projected be known, then this greatest horizontal range may be thus found. Compute, according to the common theory of gravity, what space the projected body ought to fall through to acquire the velocity with which it is projected: then twice that space will be the greatest horizontal range, or the horizontal range when the body is projected in an angle of 45° with the horizon.\n\n6. The horizontal ranges of a body, when projected with the same velocity at different angles, will be between themselves as the sines of twice the angle in which the line of projection is inclined to the horizon.\n\n7. If a body is projected in the same angle with the horizon, but with different velocities, the horizontal ranges will be in the duplicate proportion of those velocities.\n\nThese postulates, which contain the principles of the modern art of gunnery, are all of them false; for it hath been already shown, that a musket ball of three-fourths of an inch in diameter, fired with half its weight of powder, from a piece 45 inches long, moves with a velocity of near 1700 feet in a second. Now, if this ball flew in the curve of a parabola, its horizontal range at 45° would be found by the fifth postulate to be...\nbe about 17 miles. But all the practical writers assure us, that this range is really short of half a mile. Diego Ufano affirms an arquebus, four feet in length, and carrying a leaden ball of 1½ oz. weight (which is very near our dimensions), a horizontal range of 797 common paces, when it is elevated between 40° and 50° degrees, and charged with a quantity of fine powder equal in weight to the ball. Merlennus also tells us, that he found the horizontal range of an arquebus at 45° to be less than 400 fathoms, or 800 yards; whence, as either of these ranges are short of half an English mile, it follows, that a musket shot, when fired with a reasonable charge of powder at the elevation of 45°, flies not one-thirty-fourth part of the distance it ought to do if it moved in a parabola. Nor is this great contraction of the horizontal range to be wondered at, when it is considered that the resistance of this bullet when it first issues from the piece amounts to 120 times its gravity, as hath been experimentally demonstrated.\n\n\"To prevent objections, our next instance shall be in an iron bullet of 2.4 lb. weight, which is the heaviest in common use for land-service. Such a bullet fired from a piece of the common dimensions with its greatest allotment of powder hath a velocity of 1650 feet in a second, as already shown. Now, if the horizontal range of this shot at 45° be computed on the parabolic hypothesis by the fifth postulate, it will come out to be about 16 miles, which is between five and six times its real quantity; for the practical writers all agree in making it less than three miles.\n\n\"But farther, it is not only when projectiles move with these very great velocities that their flight sensibly varies from the curve of a parabola; the same aberration often takes place in such as move slow enough to have their motion traced out by the eye; for there are few projectiles that can be thus examined, which do not visibly disagree with the first, second, and third postulates; obviously defending through a curve, which is shorter and less inclined to the horizon than that in which they ascended. Also the highest point of their flight, or the vertex of the curve, is much nearer the place where they fall to the ground than to that from whence they were at first discharged.\n\n\"I have found too by experience, that the fifth, sixth, and seventh postulates are excessively erroneous when applied to the motions of bullets moving with small velocities. A leaden bullet three-fourths of an inch in diameter, discharged with a velocity of about 400 feet in a second, and in an angle of 19° 5' with the horizon, ranged on the horizontal plane no more than 448 yards; whereas its greatest horizontal range being found by the fifth postulate to be at least 1700 yards, the range at 19° 5' ought by the sixth postulate to have been 1050 yards; whence, in this experiment, the range was not three-sevenths of what it must have been, had the commonly received theory been true.\"\n\nFrom this and other experiments it is clearly proved, that the track described by the flight even of the heaviest shot, is neither a parabola, nor approaching to a parabola, except when they are projected with very small velocities. The nature of the curve really described by them is explained under the article PROJECTILES. But as a specimen of the great complication of that subject, we shall here insert an account of Theory, a very extraordinary circumstance which frequently takes place therein.\n\n\"As gravity acts perpendicularly to the horizon, it is evident, that if no other power but gravity deflected a projected body from its course, its motion would be constantly performed in a plane perpendicular to the horizon, passing through the line of its original direction; but we have found, that the body in its motion often deviates from this plane, sometimes to the right hand and at other times to the left; and this in an incurved line, which is convex towards that plane, so that the motion of a bullet is frequently in a line having a double curvature, it being bent towards the horizon by the force of gravity, and again bent out of its original direction to the right or left by some other force; in this case no part of the motion of the bullet is performed in the same plane, but its track will lie in the surface of a kind of cylinder, whose axis is perpendicular to the horizon.\n\n\"This proposition may be indisputably proved by the experience of every one in the least conversant with the practice of gunnery. The same piece which will carry its bullet within an inch of the intended mark at 10 yards distance, cannot be relied on to 10 inches in 100 yards, much less to 30 inches in 300 yards. Now this inequality can only arise from the track of the bullet being incurvated sidewise as well as downwards; for by this means the distance between that incurvated line and the line of direction will increase in a much greater ratio than that of the distance; these lines being coincident at the mouth of the piece, and afterwards separating in the manner of a curve and its tangent, if the mouth of the piece be considered as the point of contact. To put this matter out of all doubt, however, I took a barrel carrying a ball three-fourths of an inch diameter, and fixing it on a heavy carriage, I satisfied myself of the steadiness and truth of its direction, by firing at a board ¼ feet square, which was placed at 180 feet distance; for I found that in 16 successive shots I missed the mark but once. Now, the same barrel being fixed on the same carriage, and fired with a smaller quantity of powder, so that the shock on the discharge would be much less, and consequently the direction less changed, I found, that at 760 yards distance the ball flew sometimes 100 yards to the right of the line it was pointed on, and sometimes as much to the left. I found, too, that its direction in the perpendicular line was not less uncertain, it falling one time above 200 yards short of what it did at another; although, by the nicest examination of the piece after the discharge, it did not appear to have started in the least from the position it was placed in.\n\n\"The reality of this doubly curved track being thus demonstrated, it may perhaps be asked, What can be the cause of a motion so different from what has been hitherto supposed? And to this I answer, That the deflection in question must be owing to some power acting obliquely to the progressive motion of the body; which power can be no other than the resistance of the air. If it be farther asked, how the resistance of the air can ever come to be oblique to the progressive motion of the body? I farther reply, that it may sometimes arise from inequalities in the resisting surface; but that its general cause is doubtless a whirling mo-\nTheory. tion acquired by the bullet about its axis: for by this motion of rotation, combined with the progressive motion, each part of the bullet's surface will strike the air very differently from what it would do if there was no such whirl; and the obliquity of the action of the air arising from this cause will be greater, as the motion of the bullet is greater in proportion to its progressive one.\n\nThis whirling motion undoubtedly arises from the friction of the bullet against the sides of the piece; and as the rotatory motion will in some part of its revolution conspire with the progressive one, and in another part be equally opposed to it, the resistance of the air on the fore part of the bullet will be hereby affected, and will be increased in that part where the whirling motion conspires with the progressive one, and diminished where it is opposed to it; and by this means the whole effect of the resistance, instead of being opposite to the direction of the body, will become oblique thereto, and will produce those effects already mentioned. If it was possible to predict the position of the axis round which the bullet should whirl, and if that axis was unchangeable during the whole flight of the bullet, then the aberration of the bullet by this oblique force would be in a given direction; and the incursion produced thereby would regularly extend the same way from one end of its track to the other. For instance, if the axis of the whirl was perpendicular to the horizon, then the incursion would be to the right or left. If that axis was horizontal, and perpendicular to the direction of the bullet, then the incursion would be upwards or downwards. But as the first position of this axis is uncertain, and as it may perpetually shift in the course of the bullet's flight; the deviation of the bullet is not necessarily either in one certain direction, or tending to the same side in one part of its track more than it does in another, but more usually is continually changing the tendency of its deflection, as the axis round which it whirls must frequently shift its position to the progressive motion by many inevitable accidents.\n\nThat a bullet generally acquires such a rotatory motion, as here described, is, I think, demonstrable; however, to leave no room for doubt or dispute, I confirmed it, as well as some other parts of my theory, by the following experiments.\n\nI caused the machine to be made represented in fig. 4. BCDE is a brass barrel, moveable on its axis, and so adjusted by means of friction-wheels, not represented in the figure, as to have no friction worth attending to. The frame in which this barrel is fixed is so placed that its axis may be perpendicular to the horizon. The axis itself is continued above the upper plate of the frame, and has fastened on it a light hollow cone, AFG. From the lower part of this cone there is extended a long arm of wood, GH, which is very thin, and cut feather-edged. At its extremity there is a contrivance for fixing on the body, whose resistance is to be investigated (as here the globe P); and to prevent the arm GH from swaying out of its horizontal position by the weight of the annexed body P, there is a brace, AH, of fine wire, fastened to the top of the cone which supports the end of the arm.\n\nRound the barrel BCDE, there is wound a fine silk line, the turns of which appear in the figure; and after this line hath taken a sufficient number of turns, it is conducted nearly in a horizontal direction to the pully L, over which it is passed, and then a proper weight M is hung to its extremity. If this weight be left at liberty, it is obvious that it will descend by its own gravity, and will, by its descent, turn round the barrel BCDE, together with the arm GH, and the body P fastened to it. And whilst the resistance on the arm GH and on the body P is less than the weight M, that weight will accelerate its motion; and thereby the motion of GH and P will increase, and consequently their resistance will increase, till at last this resistance and the weight M become nearly equal to each other. The motion with which M descends, and with which P revolves, will not then sensibly differ from an equable one. Whence it is not difficult to conceive, that, by proper observations made with this machine, the resistance of the body P may be determined. The most natural method of proceeding in this investigation is as follows: Let the machine first have acquired its equable motion, which it will usually do in about five or six turns from the beginning; and then let it be observed, by counting a number of turns, what time is taken up by one revolution of the body P: then taking off the body P and the weight M, let it be examined what smaller weight will make the arm GH revolve in the same time as when P was fixed to it: this smaller weight being taken from M, the remainder is obviously equal in effort to the resistance of the revolving body P; and this remainder being reduced in the ratio of the length of the arm to the semidiameter of the barrel, will then become equal to the absolute quantity of the resistance. And as the time of one revolution is known, and consequently the velocity of the revolving body, there is hereby discovered the absolute quantity of the resistance to the given body P moving with a given degree of celerity.\n\nHere, to avoid all objections, I have generally chosen, when the body P was removed, to fix in its stead a thin piece of lead of the same weight, placed horizontally: so that the weight which was to turn round the arm GH, without the body P, did also carry round this piece of lead. But mathematicians will easily allow that there was no necessity for this precaution. The diameter of the barrel BCDE, and of the silk string wound round it, was 2.06 inches. The length of the arm GH, measured from the axis to the surface of the globe P, was 49.5 inches. The body P, the globe made use of, was of pasteboard; its surface very neatly coated with marbled paper. It was not much distant from the size of a 12lb. shot, being in diameter 4.5 inches, so that the radius of the circle described by the centre of the globe was 51.75 inches. When this globe was fixed at the end of the arm, and a weight of half a pound was hung at the end of the string at M, it was examined how soon the motion of the descending weight M, and of the revolving body P, would become equable as to sense. With this view, three revolutions being suffered to elapse, it was found that the next 10 were performed in 27¾\", 20 in less than 55\", and 30 in 82½\"; so that the first 10 were performed in 27¾\", the second in 27¼\", and the third in 27½\". These experiments sufficiently evince, that even with half a pound, the smallest weight made use of,\nThe motion of the machine was sufficiently equable after the first three revolutions.\n\n\"The globe above mentioned being now fixed at the end of the arm, there was hung on at M a weight of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb.; and 10 revolutions being suffered to elapse, the succeeding 20 were performed in 21 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s. Then the globe being taken off, and a thin plate of lead, equal to it in weight, placed in its room; it was found, that instead of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb., a weight of one pound would make it revolve in less time than it did before; performing now 20 revolutions after 10 were elapsed in the space of 19\" s.\n\n\"Hence then it follows, that from the \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb. first hung on, there is less than 1 lb. to be deducted for the resistance on the arm; and consequently the resistance on the globe itself is not less than the effort of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) lb. in the situation M; and it appearing from the former measures, that the radius of the barrel is nearly \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the radius of the circle, described by the centre of the globe; it follows, that the absolute resistance of the globe, when it revolves 20 times in 21 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s, (about 25 feet in a second), is not less than the 50th part of two pounds and a quarter, or of 36 ounces: and this being considerably more than half an ounce, and the globe nearly the size of a twelve-pound shot, it irrefragably confirms a proposition I had formerly laid down from theory, that the resistance of the air to a 12 lb. iron shot, moving with a velocity of 25 feet in a second, is not less than half an ounce.\n\n\"The rest of the experiments were made in order to confirm another proposition, namely, that the resistance of the air within certain limits is nearly in the duplicate proportion of the velocity of the resisted body. To investigate this point, there were successively hung on at M, weights in the proportion of the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16; and letting 10 revolutions first elapse, the following observations were made on the rest.—With \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) lb. the globe went 20 turns in 54 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s, with 2 lb. it went 20 turns in 27 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s, with 4 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) lb. it went 30 turns in 27 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s, and with 8 lb. it went 40 turns in 27 \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\)\"s.—Hence it appears, that to resistances proportioned to the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, there correspond velocities of the resisted body in the proportion of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4; which proves, with great nicety, the proposition above mentioned.\n\n\"With regard to the rotatory motion, the first experiment was to evince, that the whirling motion of a ball combining with its progressive motion would produce such an oblique resistance and deflective power as already mentioned. For this purpose a wooden ball of 4 inches diameter was suspended by a double string, about eight or nine feet long. Now, by turning round the ball and twisting the double string, the ball when left to itself would have a revolving motion given it from the untwisting of the string again. And if, when the string was twisted, the ball was drawn to a considerable distance from the perpendicular, and there let go; it would at first, before it had acquired its revolving motion, vibrate steadily enough in the same vertical plane in which it first began to move: but when, by the untwisting of the string, it had acquired a sufficient degree of its whirling motion, it constantly deflected to the right or left of its first track; and sometimes proceeded so far as to have its direction at right angles to that in which it began its Theory motion; and this deviation was not produced by the string itself, but appeared to be entirely owing to the resistance being greater on the one part of the leading surface of the globe than the other. For the deviation continued when the string was totally untwisted; and even during the time that the string, by the motion the globe had received, was twisting the contrary way. And it was always easy to predict, before the ball was let go, which way it would deflect, only by considering on which side the whirl would be combined with the progressive motion; for on that side always the deflective power acted, as the resistance was greater here than on the side where the whirl and progressive motion were opposed to one another.\"\n\nThough Mr Robins considered this experiment as an incontestable proof of the truth of his theory, he undertook to give ocular demonstration of this deflection of musket-bullets even in the short space of 100 yards.\n\n\"As all projectiles (says he), in their flight, are acted upon by the power of gravity, the deflection of a bullet from its primary direction, supposes that deflection to be upwards or downwards in a vertical plane; because, in the vertical plane, the action of gravity is compounded and entangled with the deflective force. And for this reason my experiments have been principally directed to the examination of that deflection which carries the bullet to the right or left of that plane in which it began to move. For if it appears at any time that the bullet has shifted from that vertical plane in which the motion began, this will be an incontestable proof of what we have advanced. Now, by means of screens of exceeding thin paper, placed parallel to each other at proper distances, this deflection in question may be many ways investigated. For by firing bullets which shall traverse the screens, the flight of the bullet may be traced; and it may easily appear whether they do or do not keep invariably to one vertical plane. This examination may proceed on three different principles, which I shall here separately explain.\n\n\"For first, an exactly vertical plane may be traced out upon all these screens, by which the deviation of any fling bullet may be more readily investigated, only by measuring the horizontal distance of its trace from the vertical plane thus delineated; and by this means the absolute quantity of its aberration may be known. Or if the description of such a vertical plane should be esteemed a matter of difficulty and nicety, a second method may be followed; which is that of reflecting the piece in some fixed notch or socket, so that though the piece may have some little play to the right and left, yet all the lines in which the bullet can be directed shall intersect each other in the centre of that fixed socket; by this means, if two different shots are fired from the piece thus situated, the horizontal distances made by the two bullets on any two screens ought to be in the same proportion to each other as the respective distances of the screens from the socket in which the piece was laid. And if these horizontal distances differ from that proportion, then it is certain that one of the shots at least hath deviated from a vertical plane, although the absolute quantity of that deviation...\nTheory. viation cannot hence be assigned; because it cannot be known what part of it is to be imputed to one bullet, and what to the other.\n\n\"But if the constant and invariable position of the notch or socket in which the piece was placed, be thought too hard an hypothesis in this very nice affair; the third method, and which is the simplest of all, requires no more than that two shots be fired through three screens without any regard to the position of the piece each time: for in this case, if the shots diverge from each other, and both keep to a vertical plane, then if the horizontal distances of their traces on the first screen be taken from the like horizontal distances on the second and third, the two remainders will be in the same proportion with the distances of the second and third screen from the first. And if they are not in this proportion, then it will be certain that one of them at least hath been deflected from the vertical plane; though here, as in the last case, the quantity of that deflection in each will not be known.\n\n\"All these three methods I have myself made use of at different times, and have ever found the success agreeable to my expectation. But the most eligible method seemed to be a compound of the two last. The apparatus was as follows.—Two screens were set up in the larger walk in the Charter-house garden; the first of them at 250 feet distance from the wall, which was to serve for a third screen; and the second 200 feet from the same wall. At 50 feet before the first screen, or at 300 feet from the wall, there was placed a large block weighing about 200 lb. weight, and having fixed into it an iron bar with a socket at its extremity, in which the piece was to be laid. The piece itself was of a common length, and bored for an ounce ball. It was each time loaded with a ball of 17 to the pound, so that the windage was extremely small, and with a quarter of an ounce of good powder. The screens were made of the thinnest blue paper; and the reflectance they gave to the bullet (and consequently their probability of deflecting it) was so small, that a bullet lighting one time near the extremity of one of the screens, left a fine thin fragment of it towards the edge entire, which was so very weak that it was difficult to handle it without breaking. These things thus prepared, five shots were made with the piece reited in the notch above mentioned; and the horizontal distances between the first shot, which was taken as a standard, and the four succeeding ones, both on the first and second screen and on the wall, measured in inches, were as follows:\n\n| 1st Screen | 2d Screen | Wall |\n|------------|-----------|------|\n| 1 to 2     | 1.75 R.   | 3.15 R. | 16.7 R. |\n| 3          | 10 L.     | 15.6 L. | 69.25 L. |\n| 4          | 1.25 L.   | 4.5 L.  | 10 L.    |\n| 5          | 2.15 L.   | 5.1 L.  | 19.0 L.  |\n\n\"Here the letters R and L denote that the shot in question went either to the right or left of the first.\n\n\"If the position of the socket in which the piece was placed be supposed fixed, then the horizontal distances measured above on the first and second screen, and on the wall, ought to be in proportion to the distances of the first screen, the second screen, and the wall, from the socket. But by only looking over these numbers, it appears, that none of them are in that proportion; the horizontal distance of the first and third, for instance, on the wall being above nine inches more than it should be by this analogy.\n\n\"If, without supposing the invariable position of the socket, we examine the comparative horizontal distances according to the third method described above, we shall in this case discover diversifications still more extraordinary; for by the numbers set down, it appears, that the horizontal distances of the second and third shot on the two screens, and on the wall, are as under.\n\n| 1st Screen | 2d Screen | Wall |\n|------------|-----------|------|\n| 11.75      | 18.75     | 83.95 |\n\nHere, if, according to the rule given above, the distance on the first screen be taken from the distances on the other two, the remainder will be 7, and 72.2; and these numbers, if each shot kept to a vertical plane, ought to be in the proportion of 1 to 5; that being the proportion of the distances of the second screen, and of the wall, from the first; but the last number 72.2 exceeds what it ought to be by this analogy by 37.2; so that between them there is a deviation from the vertical plane of above 37 inches, and this too in a transit of little more than 80 yards.\n\n\"But farther, to show that these irregularities do not depend on any accidental circumstance of the balls fitting or not fitting the piece, there were five shots more made with the same quantity of powder as before; but with smaller bullets, which ran much looser in the piece. And the horizontal distances being measured in inches from the trace of the first bullet to each of the succeeding ones, the numbers were as under.\n\n| 1st Screen | 2d Screen | Wall |\n|------------|-----------|------|\n| 1 to 2     | 15.6 R.   | 31.1 R. | 94.0 R. |\n| 3          | 6.4 L.    | 12.75 L. | 23.0 L. |\n| 4          | 4.7 R.    | 8.5 R.  | 15.5 R. |\n| 5          | 12.6 R.   | 24.0 R. | 63.5 R. |\n\nHere, again, on the supposed fixed position of the piece, the horizontal distance on the wall between the first and third will be found above 15 inches less than it should be if each kept to a vertical plane; and like irregularities, though smaller, occur in every other experiment. And if they are examined according to the third method set down above, and the horizontal distances of the third and fourth, for instance, are compared, those on the first and second screen, and on the wall, appear to be thus.\n\n| 1st Screen | 2d Screen | Wall |\n|------------|-----------|------|\n| 11.1       | 21.25     | 38.5 |\n\n\"And if the horizontal distance on the first screen be taken from the other two, the remainders will be 10.15, and 27.4; where the least of them, instead of being five times the first, as it ought to be, is 45.35 short of it; so that here is a deviation of 45 inches.\n\n\"From all these experiments, the deflection in question seems to be incontestably evinced. But to give some farther light to this subject, I took a barrel of the same bore with that hitherto used, and bent it at about three or four inches from its muzzle to the left, the bend making an angle of three or four degrees, with...\"\nTheory, with the axis of the piece. This piece thus bent was fired with a loose ball, and the same quantity of powder hitherto used, the screens of the last experiment being still continued. It was natural, to expect, that if this piece was pointed by the general direction of its axis, the ball would be canted to the left of that direction by the bend near its mouth. But as the bullet, in passing through that bent part would, as I conceived, be forced to roll upon the right-hand side of the barrel, and thereby its left side would turn up against the air, and would increase the resistance on that side; I predicted to the company then present, that if the axis on which the bullet whirled, did not shift its position after it was separated from the piece; then, notwithstanding the bent of the piece to the left, the bullet itself might be expected to incurvate towards the right; and this, upon trial, did most remarkably happen. For one of the bullets fired from this bent piece passed through the first screen about 1½ inch distant from the trace of one of the shots fired from the straight piece in the last set of experiments. On the second screen, the traces of the same bullets were about three inches distant; the bullet from the crooked piece passing on both screens to the left of the other: but comparing the places of these bullets on the wall, it appeared that the bullet from the crooked piece, though it diverged from the track on the two screens, had now crossed that track, and was deflected considerably to the right of it: so that it was obvious, that though the bullet from the crooked piece might first be canted to the left, and had diverged from the track of the other bullet with which it was compared, yet by degrees it deviated again to the right, and a little beyond the second screen crossed that track from which it before diverged, and on the wall was deflected 14 inches, as I remember, on the contrary side. And this experiment is not only the most convincing proof of the reality of this deflection here contended for; but is likewise the strongest confirmation that it is brought about in the very manner and by the very circumstances which we have all along described.\n\n\"I have now only to add, that as I suspected the consideration of the revolving motion of the bullet, compounded with its progressive one, might be considered as a subject of mathematical speculation, and that the reality of any deflecting force thence arising might perhaps be denied by some computations upon the principles hitherto received of the action of fluids; I thought proper to annex a few experiments, with a view of evincing the strange deficiency of all theories of this sort hitherto established, and the unexpected and wonderful varieties which occur in these matters: The proposition which I advanced for this purpose being, That two equal surfaces meeting the air with the same degree of obliquity, may be so differently resisted, that though in one of them the resistance is less than that of a perpendicular surface meeting the same quantity of air, yet in another it shall be considerably greater.\n\n\"To make out this proposition, I made use of the machine already described: and having prepared a parallelogram pyramid, whose base was four inches square, and whose planes made angles of 45° with the plane of its base; and also a parallelogram four inches in breadth, and 5½ inches length, which was equal to the surface of the pyramid, the globe P was taken off from the machine, and the pyramid was first fixed on 3½ lb. being hung at M, and the pyramid so fitted as to move with its vertex forwards, it performed 20 revolutions after the first ten were elapsed in 33½\". Then the pyramid being turned, so that its base, which was a plane of four inches square, went foremost, it now performed 20 revolutions with the same weight in 38½\".—After this, taking off the pyramid, and fixing on the parallelogram with its longer side perpendicular to the arm, and placing its surface in an angle of 45° with the horizon by a quadrant, the parallelogram, with the same weight, performed 20 revolutions in 43½\".\n\n\"Now here this parallelogram and the surface of the pyramid are equal to each other, and each of them met the air in an angle of 45°; and yet one of them made 20 revolutions in 33½\", whilst the other took up 43½\". And at the same time it appears, that a flat surface, such as the base of a pyramid, which meets the same quantity of air perpendicularly, makes 20 revolutions in 38½\", which is the medium between the other two.\n\n\"But to give another and still more simple proof of this principle: there was taken a parallelogram four inches broad and 8½ long. This being fixed at the end of the arm, with its long side perpendicular thereto, and being placed in an angle of 45° with the horizon, there was a weight hung on at M of 3½ lb. with which the parallelogram made 20 revolutions in 40½\". But after this, the position of the parallelogram was shifted, and it was placed with its shorter side perpendicular to the arm, though its surface was still inclined to an angle of 45° with the horizon; and now, instead of going slower, as might have been expected from the greater extent of part of its surface from the axis of the machine, it went round much faster: for in this last situation it made 20 revolutions in 35½\", so that there were 5\" difference in the time of 20 revolutions; and this from no other change of circumstance than as the larger or shorter side of the oblique plane was perpendicular to the line of its direction.\"\n\nIn the 73rd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, several experiments on this subject, but upon a larger scale, are related by Lovell Edgeworth, Esq. They confirm the truth of what Mr Robins advances, but nothing is said to explain the reason of it.\n\nThese are the principal experiments made by Mr Why the Robins in confirmation of his theory, and which not only far exceed everything that had been formerly done, but even bid fair for advancing the art of gunnery to its ne plus ultra. It must be observed, however, that in this art it is impossible we should ever arrive at absolute perfection; that is, it can never be expected that a gunner, by any method of calculation whatever, can be enabled to point his guns in such a manner, that the shot shall hit the mark if placed anywhere within its range. Aberrations, which can by no means be either foreseen or prevented, will take place from a great number of different causes. A variation in the density of the atmosphere, in the dampness of the powder, or in the figure of the shot, will cause variations in the range of the bullet, which cannot by any means be reduced to rules, and consequently must\nmust render the event of each shot very precarious. The resistance of the atmosphere simply considered, without any of those anomalies arising from its density at different times, is a problem, which, notwithstanding the labours of Mr. Robins and others, hath not been completely solved; and indeed if we consider the matter in a physical light, we shall find, that without some other data than those which are yet obtained, an exact solution of it is impossible.\n\nIt is an objection that hath been made to the mathematical philosophy, and to which in many cases it is most certainly liable, that it considers the resistance of matter more than its capacity of giving motion to other matter. Hence, if in any case matter acts both as a resisting and a moving power, and the mathematician overlooks its effort towards motion, founding his demonstrations only upon its property of resisting, these demonstrations will certainly be false, though they should be supported by all the powers of geometry. It is an error of this kind that we are to attribute the great differences already taken notice of between the calculations of Sir Isaac Newton, with regard to the resisting force of fluids, and what actually takes place upon trial. These calculations were made upon the supposition that the fluid through which a body moved could do nothing else but resist it; yet it is certain that the air (the fluid with which we have to do at present) proves a source of motion, as well as resistance, to all bodies which move in it.\n\nTo understand this matter fully, let ABC (fig. 5.) represent a crooked tube made of any solid matter, and a, b, two pistons which exactly fill the cavity. If the space between these pistons is full of air, it is plain they cannot come into contact with each other on account of the elasticity of the included air, but will remain at some certain distance as represented in the figure. If the piston b is drawn up, the air which presses in the direction Cb acts as a resisting power, and the piston will not be drawn up with such ease as if the whole was in vacuo. But though the column of air pressing in the direction Cb acts as a resisting power on the piston b, the column pressing in the direction Aa will act as a moving power upon the piston a. It is therefore plain, that if b is moved upwards till it comes to the place marked d, the other will descend to that marked c. Now, if we suppose the piston a to be removed, it is plain, that when b is pulled upwards to d, the air descending through the leg AaCB will press on the under side of the piston b, as strongly as it would have done upon the upper side of the piston a, had it been present. Therefore, though the air pulling down through the leg CB resists the motion of the piston b when drawn upwards, the air pressing down through the leg Aa forwards it as much; and accordingly the piston b may be drawn up or pulled down at pleasure, and with very little trouble. But if the orifice at A is stopped, so that the air can only exert its resisting power on the piston b, it will require a considerable degree of strength to move the piston from b to d.\n\nIf now we suppose the tube to be entirely removed (which indeed answers no other purpose than to render the action of the air more evident), it is plain, that if the piston is moved either up or down, or in any other direction we can imagine, the air presses as much upon the back part of it as it resists it on the fore part; and of consequence a ball moving through the air with any degree of velocity, ought to be as much accelerated by the action of the air behind, as it is retarded by the action of that before.—Here then it is natural to ask, If the air accelerates a moving body as much as it retards it, how comes it to make any resistance at all? yet certain it is, that this fluid doth resist, and that very considerably. To this it may be answered, that the air is always kept in some certain state or condition by another power which rules all its motions, and it is this power undoubtedly which gives the resistance. It is not to our purpose at present to inquire what that power is; but we see that the air is often in very different states; one day, for instance, its parts are violently agitated by a storm; and another, perhaps, they are comparatively at rest in a calm. In the first case, nobody hesitates to own, that the storm is occasioned by some cause or other, which violently resists any other power that would prevent the agitation of the air. In a calm the case is the same; for it would require the same exertion of power to excite a tempest in a calm day, as to allay a tempest in a stormy one. Now it is evident, that all projectiles, by their motion, agitate the atmosphere in an unnatural manner; and consequently are resisted by that power, whatever it is, which tends to restore the equilibrium, or bring back the atmosphere to its former state.\n\nIf no other power besides that above mentioned acted upon projectiles, it is probable, that all resistance to their motion would be in the duplicate proportion of their velocities; and accordingly, as long as the velocity is small, we find it generally is so. But when the velocity comes to be exceedingly great, other forces of resistance arise. One of these is a subtraction of part of the moving power; which though not properly a resistance, or opposing another power to it, is an equivalent thereto. This subtraction arises from the following cause. The air, as we have already observed, presses upon the hinder part of the moving body by its gravity, as much as it resists the fore part of it by the same property. Nevertheless, the velocity with which the air presses upon any body by means of its gravity, is limited; and it is possible that a body may change its place with so great velocity that the air hath not time to rush in upon the back part of it in order to assist its progressive motion. When this happens to be the case, there is in the first place a deficiency of the moving power equivalent to 15 pounds on every square inch of surface; at the same time that there is a positive resistance of as much more on the fore part, owing to the gravity of the atmosphere, which must be overcome before the body can move forward.\n\nThis deficiency of moving power, and increase of resistance, do not only take place when the body moves with a very great degree of velocity, but in all motions whatever. It is not in all cases perceptible, because the velocity with which the body moves, frequently bears but a very small proportion to the velocity with which the air presses in behind it. Thus, supposing the velocity with which the air rushes into a vacuum to be 1280 feet in a second, if a body moves with a velocity of 40, or 50 feet in a second, the force with which the air presses on the back part is but \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) of the utmost less than that which resists on the fore part of it, which\nwhich will not be perceptible; but if, as in the case of bullets, the velocity of the projectile comes to have a considerable proportion to the velocity wherewith the air rushes in behind it; then a very perceptible and otherwise unaccountable resistance is observed, as we have seen in the experiments already related by Mr Robins. Thus, if the air presses in with a velocity of 1200 feet in a second, if the body changes its place with a velocity of 600 feet in the same time, there is a resistance of 15 pounds on the fore part, and a pressure of only \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) pounds on the back part. The resistance therefore not only overcomes the moving power of the air by \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) pounds, but there is a deficiency of other \\( \\frac{7}{4} \\) pounds owing to the want of half the pressure of the atmosphere on the back part, and thus the whole loss of the moving power is equivalent to 15 pounds; and hence the exceeding great increase of resistance observed by Mr Robins beyond what it ought to be according to the common computations.—The velocity with which the air rushes into a vacuum is therefore a defidaturum in gunnery. Mr Robins supposes that it is the same with the velocity of sound; and that when a bullet moves with a velocity greater than that of 1200 feet in a second, it leaves a perfect vacuum behind it. Hence he accounts for the great increase of resistance to bullets moving with such velocities; but as he doth not take notice of the loss of the air's moving power, the anomalies of all lesser velocities are inexplicable on his principles. Nay, he even tells us, that Sir Isaac Newton's rule for computing resistances may be applied in all velocities less than 1100 or 1200 feet in a second, though this is expressly contradicted by his own experiments mentioned No. 23.\n\nThough for these reasons it is evident how great difficulties must occur in attempting to calculate the resistance of the air to military projectiles, we have not even yet discovered all the sources of resistance to these bodies when moving with immense velocities. Another power by which they are opposed (and which at last becomes greater than any of those hitherto mentioned) is the air's elasticity. This, however, will not begin to show itself in the way of resistance till the velocity of the moving body becomes considerably greater than that by which the air presses into a vacuum. Having therefore first attained this velocity, which we shall suppose to be 1200 feet in a second, it is plain, that if a body moves with a velocity of 1800 feet in a second, it must compress the air before it; because the fluid hath neither time to expand itself in order to fill the vacuum left behind the moving body, nor to rush in by its gravity. This compression it will resist by its elastic power, which thus becomes a new source of resistance, increasing, without any limit, in proportion to the velocity of the moving body. If now we suppose the moving body to set out with a velocity of 2400 feet in a second, it is plain, that there is not only a vacuum left behind the body, but the air before it is compressed into half its natural space. The loss of motion in the projectile therefore is now very considerable. It first loses 15 pounds on every square inch of surface on account of the deficiency of the moving power of the air behind it; then it loses 15 pounds more on account of the resistance of the air before it; again it loses 15 pounds on account of the elasticity of the compressed air; and lastly another 15 pounds on account of the vacuum behind, which takes off the weight Theory of the atmosphere, that would have been equivalent to one half of the elasticity of the air before it. The whole resistance therefore upon every square inch of surface moving with this velocity is 60 pounds, besides that which arises from the power tending to preserve the general state of the atmosphere, and which increases in the duplicate proportion of the velocity as already mentioned. If the body is supposed to move with a velocity of 4800 feet in a second, the resistance from the air's elasticity will then be quadrupled, or amount to 60 pounds on the square inch of surface; which added to the other causes, produces a resistance of 125 pounds upon the square inch; and thus would the resistance from the elasticity of the air go on continually increasing, till at last the motion of the projectile would be as effectually stopped as if it was fired against a wall. This obstacle therefore we are to consider as really insuperable by any art whatever, and therefore it is not advisable to use larger charges of powder than what will project the shot with a velocity of 1200 feet in a second. To this velocity the elasticity of the air will not make great resistance, if indeed it makes any at all: for though Mr Robins hath conjectured that air rushes into a vacuum with the velocity of sound, or between 11 and 1290 feet in a second; yet we have no decisive proof of the truth of this supposition. At this velocity indeed, according to Mr Robins, a very sudden increase of resistance takes place: but this is denied by Mr Glenie*, who supposes that the resistance proceeds gradually; and indeed it seems to be pretty obvious, that the resistance cannot very suddenly increase, p. 48, if the velocity is only increased in a small degree. Yet it is certain, that the swiftest motions with which cannon-balls can be projected are very soon reduced to this standard; for Mr Robins acquaints us, that \"a 24-pound shot, when discharged with a velocity of 2000 feet in a second, will be reduced to that of 1200 feet in a second in a flight of little more than 500 yards.\"\n\nIn the 7th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, Count Rumford has proposed a new method of determining the velocities of bullets, by measuring the force of the recoil of the piece. As in all cases action and reaction are supposed to be equal to one another, it appears that the momentum of a gun, or the force of its recoil backwards, must always be equivalent to the force of its charge: that is, the velocity with which the gun recoils, multiplied into its weight, is equal to the velocity of the bullet multiplied into its weight; for every particle of matter, whether solid or fluid, that issues out of the mouth of a piece, must be impelled by the action of some power, which power must react with equal force against the bottom of the bore.—Even the fine invisible elastic fluid that is generated from the powder in its inflammation, cannot put itself in motion without reacting against the gun at the same time. Thus we see pieces, when they are fired with powder alone, recoil as well as when their charges are made to impel a weight of shot, though the recoil is not in the same degree in both cases. It is easy to determine the velocity of the recoil in any given case, by suspending the gun in an horizontal position by two pendulous rods, and measuring the arc of its ascent by means of a ribbon, as mentioned under\nThe article Gunpowder; and this will give the momentum of the gun, its weight being known, and consequently the momentum of its charge. But in order to determine the velocity of the bullet from the momentum of the recoil, it will be necessary to know how much the weight and velocity of the elastic fluid contributes to it.\n\n\"That part of the recoil which arises from the expansion of the fluid is always very nearly the same, whether the powder is fired alone, or whether the charge is made to impel one or more bullets, as has been determined by a great variety of experiments.—If therefore a gun, fulminated according to the method prescribed, is fired with any given charge of powder, but without any bullet or wad, and the recoil is observed, and if the same piece is afterwards fired with the same quantity of powder, and a bullet of a known weight, the excess of the velocity of the recoil in the latter case, over that in the former, will be proportional to the velocity of the bullet; for the difference of these velocities, multiplied into the weight of the gun, will be equal to the weight of the bullet multiplied into its velocity.—Thus, if W is put equal to the weight of the gun, U = the velocity of the bullet when fired with a given charge of powder without any bullet; V = the velocity of the recoil, when the same charge is made to impel a bullet; B = the weight of the bullet, and v = its velocity; it will be \\( \\frac{V - U + W}{B} \\).\n\nTo determine how far this theory agreed with practice, an experiment was made with a charge of 165 grains of powder without any bullet, which produced a recoil of 5.5 inches; and in another, with a bullet, the recoil was 5.6 inches; the mean of which is 5.55 inches; answering to a velocity of 11358 feet in a second. In five experiments with the same charge of powder, and a bullet weighing 580 grains, the mean was 14.6 inches; and the velocity of the recoil answering to the length just mentioned, is 19880 feet in a second; consequently \\( V - U \\), or 2.9880 - 1.1358, is equal to 1.8522 feet in a second. But as the velocities of recoil are known to be as the chords of the arcs through which the barrel ascends, it is not necessary, in order to determine the velocity of the bullet, to compute the velocities V and U; but the quantity \\( V - U \\), or the difference of the velocities of the recoil when the given charge is fired with and without a bullet, may be computed from the value of the difference of the chords by one operation.—Thus the velocity answering to the chord 0.95 is that of 1.8522 feet in a second, is just equal to \\( V - U \\), as was before found.\n\nIn this experiment the weight of the barrel with its carriage was just 47\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) pounds, to which \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of a pound were to be added on account of the weight of the rods by which it was suspended; which makes W = 48 pounds, or 336,000 grains. The weight of the bullet was 580 grains; whence B is to W as 580 to 336,000; that is, as 1 to 579.31 very nearly. The value of \\( V - U \\), answering to the experiments before mentioned, was found to be 1.8522; consequently the velocity of the bullets \\( = v \\), was \\( 1.8522 \\times 579.31 = 1073 \\) feet, which differs only by 10 from 1083, the velocities found by the pendulum.\n\nThe velocities of the bullets may be found from the recoil by a still more simple method; for the velocities of the recoil being as the chords measured upon the ribbon, if c is put equal to the chord of the recoil expressed in English inches, when the piece is fired with powder only, and C = the chord when the same piece is charged with a bullet; then \\( C - c \\) will be as \\( V - U \\); and consequently as \\( \\frac{V - U + W}{B} \\), which measures the velocity of the bullet, the ratio of W to B remaining the same.—If therefore we suppose a case in which \\( C - c \\) is equal to one inch, and the velocity of the bullet is computed from that chord, the velocity in any other case, wherein \\( C - c \\) is greater or less than one inch, will be found by multiplying the difference of the chords C and c by the velocity that answers to the difference of one inch.—The length of the parallel rods, by which the piece was suspended being 64 inches, the velocity of the recoil, \\( = C - c = 1 \\) inch measured upon the ribbon, is 0.204655 parts of a foot in one second; which in this case is also the value of \\( V - U \\); the velocity of the bullet, or \\( v \\), is therefore \\( 0.204655 \\times 579.31 = 118.35 \\) feet in a second. Hence the velocity of the bullet may in all cases be found by multiplying the difference of the chords C and c by 118.35; the weight of the barrel, the length of the rods by which it is suspended, and the weight of the bullet remaining the same; and this whatever the charge of powder made use of may be, and however it may differ in strength and goodness.\n\nThe exactness of this second method will appear from the following experiments. On firing the piece with 145 grains of powder and a bullet, the mean of three sets of experiments was 13.25, 13.15, and 13.23; and with the same charge of powder without a bullet, the recoil was 4.5, 4.3, or 4.4; \\( C - c \\) therefore was 13.2 - 4.4 = 8.8 inches; and the velocity of the bullets, \\( = 8.8 \\times 118.35 = 1045 \\) feet in a second; the velocities by the pendulum coming out 10.40 feet in the same space of time.\n\nIn the far greatest number of experiments to determine the comparative accuracy of the two methods, a surprising agreement was found betwixt the last mentioned one and that by the pendulum; but in some few the differences were very remarkable. Thus, in two where the recoil was 12.92 and 13.23, the velocity, by computation from the chords, is 1030 feet per second; but in computing by the pendulum it amounted only to 900; but in these some inaccuracy was suspected in the experiment with the pendulum, and that the computation from the recoil was most to be depended upon. In another experiment, the velocity by the recoil exceeded that by the pendulum by no less than 346 feet; the former showing 2109, and the latter only 1763 feet in a second. In two others the pendulum was also deficient, though not in such a degree. In all these it is remarkable, that where the difference was considerable, it was still in favour of the recoil. The deficiency in these experiments appears to have been somewhat embarrassing to our author. \"It cannot be supposed, says he, that it arose from any imperfection in Mr Robins's method of determining the velocities of bullets; for that method is founded upon such principles as leave no room to doubt of its accura-\nand the practical errors that occur in making the experiments, and which cannot be entirely prevented, or exactly compensated, are in general so small, that the difference in the velocities cannot be attributed to them. It is true, the effect of those errors is more likely to appear in experiments made under such circumstances as the present; for the bullet being very light (a), the arc of the ascent of the pendulum was but small; and a small mistake in measuring the chord upon the ribbon would have produced a very considerable error in computing the velocity of the bullet. Thus a difference of one-tenth of an inch, more or less, upon the ribbon, in that experiment where the difference was greatest, would have made a difference in the velocity of more than 120 feet in a second. But, independent of the pains that were taken to prevent mistakes, the striking agreement of the velocities in so many other experiments, affords abundant reason to conclude, that the errors arising from those causes were in no case very considerable.—But if both methods of determining the velocities of bullets are to be relied on, then the difference of the velocities, as determined by them in these experiments, can only be accounted for by supposing that it arose from their having been diminished by the resistance of the air in the passage of the bullets from the mouth of the piece to the pendulum: and this suspicion will be much strengthened, when we consider how great the resistance of the air is to bodies that move very swiftly in it; and that the bullets in these experiments were not only projected with great velocities, but were also very light, and consequently more liable to be retarded by the resistance on that account.\n\n\"To put the matter beyond all doubt, let us see what the resistance was that these bullets met with, and how much their velocities were diminished by it. The weight of the bullet in the most erroneous experiment was 90 grains; its diameter 0.78 of an inch; and it was projected with a velocity of 2109 feet in a second. If now a computation be made according to the law laid down by Sir Isaac Newton for compressed fluids, it will be found, that the resistance to this bullet was not less than 84 pounds avoirdupois, which is something more than 660 times its own weight. But Mr Robins has shewn by experiment, that the resistance of the air to bodies moving in it with very great velocity, is near three times greater than Sir Isaac has determined it; and as the velocity with which this bullet was propelled is considerably greater than any in Mr Robins's experiments, it is highly probable, that the resistance in this instance was at least 2000 times greater than the weight of the bullet.\n\n\"The distance from the mouth of the piece to the pendulum was 12 feet; but, as there is reason to think that the blast of the powder, which always follows the bullet, continues to act upon it for some sensible space of time after it is out of the bore, and, by urging it on, counterbalances, or at least counteracts in a great measure, the resistance of the air, we will suppose that the resistance does not begin, or rather that the motion of the bullet does not begin to be retarded, till it\n\n(a) They were made of lead inclosing a nucleus of Paris plaster.\nit was determined by the recoil, was considerably less in proportion in that experiment than in many others which preceded and followed it in the same feet.\n\n\"As allowance has been made for the resistance of the air in these cases, it may be expected that the same should be done in all other cases: but it will probably appear, upon inquiry, that the diminution of the velocities of the bullets, on that account, was so inconsiderable, that it might safely be neglected; thus, for instance, in the experiments with an ounce of powder, when the velocity of the bullet was more than 1750 feet in a second, the diminution turns out no more than 25 or 30 feet in a second, though we suppose the full resistance to have begun so near as two feet from the mouth of the piece; and in all cases where the velocity was less, the effect of the resistance was less in a much greater proportion: and even in this instance, there is reason to think, that the diminution of the velocity, as we have determined it, is too great: for the flame of gunpowder expands with such amazing rapidity, that it is scarcely to be supposed but that it follows the bullet, and continues to act upon it more than two feet, or even four feet, from the gun; and when the velocity of the bullet is less, its action upon it must be sensible at a still greater distance.\"\n\nAs this method of determining the velocities of bullets by the recoil of the piece did not occur to Count Rumford till after he had finished his experiments with a pendulum, and taken down his apparatus, he had it not in his power to determine the comparative strength of the recoil without and with a bullet; and consequently the velocity with which the flame issues from the mouth of a piece. He is of opinion, however, that every thing relative to these matters may be determined with greater accuracy by the new method than by any other formerly practised; and he very justly remarks, that the method of determining the velocity by the recoil, gives it originally as the bullet gets out; while that by the pendulum shows it only after a part has been destroyed by the resistance of the air. In the course of his remarks, he criticizes upon a part of Mr Robins's theory, that when bullets of the same diameter, but different weights, are discharged from the same piece by the same quantity of powder, their velocities are in the sub-duplicate ratio of their weight. This theory, he observes, is manifestly defective, as being founded upon a supposition, that the action of the elastic fluid, generated from the powder, is always the same in any and every given part of the bore when the charge is the same, whatever may be the weight of the bullet; and as no allowance is made for the expenditure of force required to put the fluid itself in motion, nor for the loss of it by the vent. \"It is true (says he) Dr Hutton in his experiments found this law to obtain without any great error; and possibly it may hold good with sufficient accuracy in many cases; for it sometimes happens, that a number of errors or actions, whose operations have a contrary tendency, to compensate each other, that their effects when united are not sensible. But when this is the case, if any one of the causes of error is removed, those which remain will be detected.—When any given charge is loaded with a heavy bullet, more of the powder is inflamed in any very short space of time than when the bullet is lighter, and the action of the powder ought upon that account to be greater; but a heavy bullet takes up longer time in passing through the bore than a light one; and consequently more of the elastic fluid generated from the powder escapes by the vent and by windage. It may happen that the augmentation of the force, on account of one of these circumstances, may be just able to counterbalance the diminution of it arising from the other; and if it should be found upon trial, that this is the case in general, in pieces as they are now constructed, and with all the variety of shot that are made use of in practice, it would be of great use to know the fact; but when, with Mr Robins, concluding too hastily from the result of a partial experiment, we suppose, that because the sum total of the prelude of the elastic fluid upon the bullet, during the time of its passage through the bore, happens to be the same when bullets of different weights are made use of, that therefore it is always so, our reasonings may prove very inconclusive, and lead to very dangerous errors.\"\n\nIn the profecution of his subject Count Rumford proves mathematically, as well as by actual experiment, that the theory laid down by Mr Robins in this respect is erroneous. The excess is in favour of heavy bullets, which acquire a velocity greater than they ought to do according to Mr Robins's rule; and so considerable are the errors, that in one of Count Rumford's experiments, the difference was no less than 2042 feet in a second. When the weight of the bullet was increased four times, the action of the powder was found to be nearly doubled; for in one experiment, when four bullets were discharged at once, the collective prelude was as 1; but when only a single bullet was made use of, it was no more than 0.5825; and on the whole he concludes, that the velocity of bullets is in the reciprocal sub-triplicate ratio of their weights. Our author observes also, that Mr Robins is not only mistaken in the particular just mentioned, but in his conclusions with regard to the absolute force of gunpowder compared with the prelude of the atmosphere; the latter being to the force of gunpowder as 1 to 1000 according to Mr Robins; but as 1 to 1308 according to Count Rumford.\n\nSect. III. Practice of Gunnery.\n\nWith regard to the practical part of gunnery, which ought to consist in directing the piece in such a manner as always to hit the object against which it is pointed, there can be no certain rules given. The following maxims are laid down by Mr Robins as of use in practice.\n\n1. In any piece of artillery whatever, the greater the quantity of powder it is charged with, the greater will be the velocity of the bullet.\n\n2. If two pieces of the same bore, but of different lengths, are fired with the same charge of powder, the longer will impel the bullet with a greater celerity than the shorter.\n\n3. If two pieces of artillery different in weight, and formed of different metals, have yet their cylinders of equal bores and equal lengths; then with like charges of powder and like bullets they will each of them discharge their shot with nearly the same degree of celerity.\n\n4. The ranges of pieces at a given elevation are no\njust measures of the velocity of the shot; for the same piece fired successively at an invariable elevation, with the powder, bullet, and every other circumstance as nearly the same as possible, will yet range to very different distances.\n\n5. The greatest part of that uncertainty in the ranges of pieces which is described in the preceding maxim, can only arise from the resistance of the air.\n\n6. The resistance of the air acts upon projectiles in a twofold manner; for it opposes their motion, and by that means continually diminishes their velocity; and it besides diverts them from the regular track they would otherwise follow; whence arise those deviations and inflections already treated of.\n\n7. That action of the air by which it retards the motion of projectiles, though much neglected by writers on artillery, is yet, in many instances, of an immense force; and hence the motion of these resisting bodies is totally different from what it would otherwise be.\n\n8. This retarding force of the air acts with different degrees of violence, according as the projectile moves with a greater or less velocity; and the resistances observe this law, that to a velocity which is double another, the resistance within certain limits is fourfold; to a treble velocity, ninefold; and so on.\n\n9. But this proportion between the resistances to two different velocities, does not hold if one of the velocities be less than that of 1200 feet in a second, and the other greater. For in that case the resistance to the greater velocity is near three times as much as it would come out by a comparison with the smaller, according to the law explained in the last maxim.\n\n10. To the extraordinary power exerted by the resistance of the air it is owing, that when two pieces of different bores are discharged at the same elevation, the piece of the largest bore usually ranges farther, provided they are both fired with fit bullets, and the customary allotment of powder.\n\n11. The greatest part of military projectiles will at the time of their discharge acquire a whirling motion round their axis by rubbing against the inside of their respective pieces; and this whirling motion will cause them to strike the air very differently from what they would do had they no other than a progressive motion. By this means it will happen, that the resistance of the air will not always be directly opposed to their flight; but will frequently act in a line oblique to their course, and will thereby force them to deviate from the regular track they would otherwise describe. And this is the true cause of the irregularities described in maxim 4.\n\n12. From the sudden trebling the quantity of the air's resistance, when the projectile moves swifter than at the rate of 1200 feet in a second (as hath been explained in maxim 9), it follows, that whatever be the regular range of a bullet discharged with this last mentioned velocity, that range will be but little increased; how much ever the velocity of the bullet may be still farther augmented by greater charges of powder.\n\n13. If the same piece of cannon be successively fired at an invariable elevation, but with various charges of powder, the greatest charge being the whole weight of the bullet in powder, and the least not less than the fifth part of that weight; then if the elevation be not less than eight or ten degrees, it will be found, that some of the ranges with the least charge will exceed some of those with the greatest.\n\n14. If two pieces of cannon of the same bore, but of different lengths, are successively fired at the same elevation with the same charge of powder; then it will frequently happen, that some of the ranges with the shorter piece will exceed some of those with the longer.\n\n15. In distant cannonadings, the advantages arising from long pieces and large charges of powder are but of little moment.\n\n16. In firing against troops with grape-shot, it will be found, that charges of powder much less than those generally used, are the most advantageous.\n\n17. The principal operations in which large charges of powder appear to be more efficacious than small ones, are the ruining of parapets, the dismounting of batteries covered by stout merlins, or battering in breach; for, in all these cases, if the object be but little removed from the piece, every increase of velocity will increase the penetration of the bullet.\n\n18. Whatever operations are to be performed by artillery, the least charges of powder with which they can be effected are always to be preferred.\n\n19. Hence, then, the proper charge of any piece of artillery is not that allotment of powder which will communicate the greatest velocity to the bullet (as most practitioners formerly maintained); nor is it to be determined by an invariable proportion of its weight to the weight of the ball; but, on the contrary, it is such a quantity of powder as will produce the least velocity for the purpose in hand; and, instead of bearing always a fixed ratio to the weight of the ball, it must be different according to the different purposes which is to be performed.\n\n20. No field-piece ought at any time to be loaded with more than \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\), or at the utmost \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the weight of its bullet in powder, nor should the charge of any battering piece exceed \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the weight of its bullet.\n\n21. Although precepts very different from those we have here given have been often advanced by artillerymen, and have been said to be derived from experience; yet is that pretended experience altogether fallacious; since from our doctrine of resistance established above, it follows, that every speculation on the subject of artillery, which is only founded on the experimental ranges of bullets discharged with considerable velocities, is liable to great uncertainty.\n\nThe greatest irregularities in the motion of bullets Description are, as we have seen, owing to the whirling motion on and use of their axis, acquired by the friction against the sides of rifled barrels. The best method hitherto known of preventing these is by the use of pieces with rifled barrels. These pieces have the insides of their cylinders cut with a number of spiral channels: so that it is in reality a female screw, varying from the common screws only in this, that its threads or ridges are less deflected, and approach more to a right line; it being usual for the threads with which the rifled barrel is indented, to take little more than one turn in its whole length. The numbers of these threads are different in each barrel, according to the size of the piece and the fancy of the workman; and in like manner the depth to\nThe usual method of charging these pieces is this: When the proper quantity of powder is put down, a leaden bullet is taken, a small matter larger than the bore of the piece was before the rifles were cut; and this bullet being laid on the mouth of the piece, and consequently too large to go down of itself, it is forced by a strong rammer impelled by a mallet, and by repeated blows is driven home to the powder; and the softness of the lead giving way to the violence with which the bullet is impelled, that zone of the bullet which is contiguous to the piece varies its circular form, and takes the shape of the inside of the barrel; so that it becomes part of a male screw exactly answering to the indents of the rifle.\n\nIn some parts of Germany and Switzerland, however, an improvement is added to this practice; especially in the larger pieces which are used for shooting at great distances. This is done by cutting a piece of very thin leather, or of thin fustian, in a circular shape, somewhat larger than the bore of the barrel. This circle being grafted on one side, is laid upon the muzzle with its greasy side downwards; and the bullet being then placed upon it, is forced down the barrel with it; by which means the leather or fustian incloses the lower half of the bullet, and, by its interposition between the bullet and the rifles, prevents the lead from being cut by them. But it must be remembered, that in the barrels where this is practised, the rifles are generally shallow, and the bullet ought not to be too large.—But as both these methods of charging at the mouth take up a good deal of time; the rifled barrels which have been made in Britain are contrived to be charged at the breech, where the piece is for this purpose made larger than in any other part. The powder and bullet are put in through the side of the barrel by an opening, which, when the piece is loaded, is then filled up with a screw. By this means, when the piece is fired, the bullet is forced through the rifles, and acquires the spiral motion already described; and perhaps somewhat of this kind, says Mr. Robins, though not in the manner now practised, would be of all others the most perfect method for the construction of these kinds of barrels.\n\nFrom the whirling motion communicated by the rifles, it happens, that when the piece is fired, that indented zone of the bullet follows the sweep of the rifles; and thereby, besides its progressive motion, acquires a circular motion round the axis of the piece; which circular motion will be continued to the bullet, after its separation from the piece; and thus a bullet discharged from a rifled barrel is constantly made to whirl round an axis which is coincident with the line of its flight. By this whirling on its axis, the aberration of the bullet, which proves so prejudicial to all operations in gunnery, is almost totally prevented. The reason of this may be easily understood from considering the slow motion of an arrow through the air. For example, if a bent arrow, with its wings not placed in some degree in a spiral position, so as to make it revolve round its axis as it flies through the air, were shot at a mark with a true direction, it would constantly deviate from it, in consequence of being profiled to one side by the convex part opposing the air obliquely. Let us now suppose this deflection in a flight of 100 yards to be equal to 10 yards. Now, if the same bent arrow were made to revolve round its axis once every two yards of its flight, its greatest deviation would take place when it had proceeded only one yard, or made half a revolution; since at the end of the next half revolution it would again return to the same direction it had at first; the convex side of the arrow having been once in opposite positions. In this manner it would proceed during the whole course of its flight, constantly returning to the true path at the end of every two yards; and when it reached the mark, the greatest deflection to either side that could happen would be equal to what it makes in proceeding one yard, equal to \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\)th part of the former, or 3.6 inches, a very small deflection when compared with the former one. In the same manner, a cannonball which turns not round its axis, deviates greatly from the true path, on account of the inequalities on its surface; which, although small, cause great deviations by reason of the resistance of the air, at the same time that the ball acquires a motion round its axis in some uncertain direction occasioned by the friction against its sides. But by the motion acquired from the rifles, the error is perpetually corrected in the manner just now described; and accordingly such pieces are much more to be depended on, and will do execution at a much greater distance, than the other.\n\nThe reasons commonly alleged for the superiority of rifle-barrels over common ones, are, either that the inflammation of the powder, is greater, by the resistance which the bullet makes by being thus forced into the barrel, and that hereby it receives a much greater impulse; or that the bullet by the compounding of its circular and revolving motions, did as it were bore the air, and thereby flew to a much greater distance than it would otherwise have done; or that by the same boring motion it made its way through all solid substances, and penetrated into them much deeper than when fired in the common manner. But Mr. Robins hath proved these reasons to be altogether erroneous, by a great number of experiments made with rifle-barrelled pieces. \"In these experiments (says he), I have found that the velocity of the bullet fired from a rifled barrel was usually less than that of the bullet fired from a common piece with the same proportion of powder. Indeed it is but reasonable to expect that this should be the case; for if the rifles are very deep, and the bullet is large enough to fill them up, the friction bears a very considerable proportion to the effort of the powder. And that in this case the friction is of consequence enough to have its effects observed, I have discovered by the continued use of the same barrel. For the metal of the barrel being soft, and wearing away space, its bore by half a year's use was considerably enlarged, and consequently the depth of its rifles diminished; and then I found that the same quantity of powder would give to the bullet a velocity near a tenth part greater than what it had done at first. And as the velocity of the bullet is not increased by the use of rifled barrels, so neither is the distance to which it flies, nor the depth of its penetration into solid substances. Indeed these two last suppositions seem at first sight too chimerical to deserve a formal confutation. But I cannot help observing,\nserving, that those who have been habituated to the use of rifled pieces are very excusable in giving way to these prejudices. For they constantly found, that with them they could fire at a mark with tolerable success, though it were placed at three or four times the distance to which the ordinary pieces were supposed to reach. And therefore, as they were ignorant of the true cause of this variety, and did not know that it arose only from preventing the deflection of the ball; it was not unnatural for them to imagine that the superiority of effect in the rifled piece was owing either to a more violent impulse at first, or to a more easy passage through the air.\n\n\"In order to confirm the foregoing theory of rifle-barrelled pieces, I made some experiments by which it might be seen whether one side of the ball discharged from them uniformly keeps foremost during the whole course. To examine this particular, I took a rifled barrel carrying a bullet of six to the pound; but instead of its leaden bullet I used a wooden one of the same size, made of a soft springy wood, which bent itself easily into the rifles without breaking. And firing the piece thus loaded against a wall at such a distance as the bullet might not be thinned by the blow, I always found, that the same surface which lay foremost in the piece continued foremost without any sensible deflection during the time of its flight. And this was easily to be observed, by examining the bullet; as both the marks of the rifles, and the part that impinged on the wall, were sufficiently apparent. Now, as these wooden bullets were but the sixth part of the weight of the leaden ones; I conclude, that if there had been any unequal resistance or deflective power, its effects must have been extremely sensible upon this light body, and consequently in some of the trials I made, the surface which came foremost from the piece must have been turned round into another situation.\n\n\"But again, I took the same piece, and, loading it now with a leaden ball, I set it nearly upright, sloping it only three or four degrees from the perpendicular in the direction of the wind; and firing it in this situation, the bullet generally continued about half a minute in the air, it rising by computation to near three quarters of a mile perpendicular height. In these trials I found that the bullet commonly came to the ground to the leeward of the piece; and at such a distance from it, as nearly corresponded to the angle of its inclination, and to the effect of the wind; it usually falling not nearer to the piece than 100, nor farther from it than 150 yards. And this is a strong confirmation of the almost steady flight of this bullet for about a mile and a half; for were the same trial made with a common piece, I doubt not but the deviation would often amount to half a mile, or perhaps considerably more; though this experiment would be a very difficult one to examine, on account of the little chance there would be of discovering where the ball fell.\n\n\"It must be observed, however, that though the bullet impelled from a rifle-barrelled piece keeps for a time to its regular track with sufficient nicety; yet if its flight be so far extended that the track becomes considerably incurved, it will then undergo considerable deflections. This, according to my experiments, arises from the angle at last made by the axis on which the bullet turns, and the direction in which it flies; for that axis continuing nearly parallel to itself, it must necessarily diverge from the line of the flight of the bullet, when that line is bent from its original direction; and when it once happens that the bullet whirls on an axis which no longer coincides with the line of its flight, then the unequal resistance formerly described will take place, and the deflecting power hence arising will perpetually increase as the track of the bullet, by having its range extended, becomes more and more incurvated.—This matter I have experienced in a small rifle-barrelled piece, carrying a leaden ball of near half an ounce weight. For this piece, charged with one dram of powder, ranged about 550 yards at an angle of 12 degrees with sufficient regularity; but being afterwards elevated to an angle of 24 degrees, it then ranged very irregularly, generally deviating from the line of its direction to the left, and in one case not less than 100 yards. This apparently arose from the cause above mentioned, as was confirmed from the constant deviation of the bullet to the left; for by considering how the revolving motion was continued with the progressive one; it appeared that a deviation that way was to be expected.\n\n\"The best remedy I can think of for this defect is the making use of bullets of an egg-like form instead of spherical ones. For if such a bullet hath its shorter axis made to fit the piece, and it be placed in the barrel with its smaller end downwards, then it will acquire by the rifles a rotation round its larger axis; and its centre of gravity lying nearer to its fore than its hinder part, its longer axis will be constantly forced by the resistance of the air into the line of its flight; as we see, that by the same means arrows constantly lie in the line of their direction, however that line be incurvated.\n\n\"But, besides this, there is another circumstance in the use of these pieces, which renders the flight of their bullets uncertain when fired at a considerable elevation. For I find by my experiments, that the velocity of a bullet fired with the same quantity of powder from a rifled barrel, varies much more from itself in different trials than when fired from a common piece. This, as I conceive, is owing to the great quantity of friction, and the impossibility of rendering it equal in each experiment. Indeed, if the rifles are not deeply cut, and if the bullet is nicely fitted to the piece, so as not to require a great force to drive it down, and if leather or fustian well greased is made use of between the bullet and barrel, perhaps, by a careful attention to all these particulars, great part of the inequality in the velocity of the bullet may be prevented, and the difficulty in question be in some measure obviated: but, till this be done, it cannot be doubted, that the range of the same piece, at an elevation, will vary considerably in every trial; although the charge be each time the same. And this I have myself experienced, in a number of diversified trials, with a rifle-barrelled piece loaded at the breech in the English manner. For here the rifles being indented very deep, and the bullet so large as to fill them up completely, I found, that though it flew with sufficient exactness to the distance of 400 or 500 yards; yet when it was raised to an angle of about 12 degrees (at which angle, being fired with one-fifth of its weight in\nin powder, its medium range is nearly 1000 yards; in this case, I say, I found that its range was variable; although the greatest care was taken to prevent any inequalities in the quantity of powder, or in the manner of charging. And as, in this case, the angle was too small for the first mentioned irregularity to produce the observed effects; they can only be imputed to the different velocities which the bullet each time received by the unequal action of the friction.\"\n\nThus we see, that it is in a manner impossible entirely to correct the aberrations arising from the resistance of the atmosphere; as even the nine-barrelled pieces cannot be depended upon for more than one-half of their actual range at any considerable elevation.\n\nIt becomes therefore a problem very difficult of solution to know, even within a very considerable distance, how far a piece will carry its ball with any probability of hitting its mark, or doing any execution. The best rules hitherto laid down on this subject are those of Mr Robins. The foundation of all his calculations is the velocity with which the bullet flies off from the mouth of the piece. Mr Robins himself had not opportunities of making many experiments on the velocities of cannon-balls, and the calculations from smaller ones cannot always be depended upon. In the 68th volume of the Phil. Trans. Mr Hutton hath recited a number of experiments made on cannon carrying balls from one to three pounds weight. His machine for discovering the velocities of these balls was the same with that of Mr Robins, only of a larger size. His charges of powder were two, four, and eight ounces; and the results of 15 experiments which seem to have been the most accurate, are as follow:\n\n| Velocity with two ounces | Velocity with four ounces | Velocity with eight ounces |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| 702 feet in 1\"          | 1608 feet in 1\"          | 1419 feet in 1\"           |\n| 682                     | 1620                    | 1332                      |\n| 695                     | 948                     | 1443                      |\n| 703                     | 973                     | 1360                      |\n| 725                     | 957                     | 1412                      |\n| Mean velocities         |                          |                           |\n\nIn another course, the mean velocities, with the same charges of powder, were 613, 873, 1162. \"The mean velocities of the balls in the first course of experiments (says Mr Hutton) with two, four, and eight ounces of powder, are as the numbers 1, 1.414, and 1.993; but the subduplicate ratio of the weights (two, four, and eight) give the numbers 1, 1.414, and 2, to which the others are sufficiently near. It is obvious, however, that the greatest difference lies in the last number, which answers to the greatest velocity. It will still be a little more in defect if we make the allowance for the weights of the balls; for the mean weights of the balls with the two and four ounces is 18½ ounces, but of the eight ounces it is 18½; diminishing therefore the number 1.993 in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of 18½ to 18½, it becomes 1.085, which falls short of the number 2 by .015, or the 133d part of itself. A similar defect was observed in the other course of experiments; and both are owing to three evident causes, viz. 1. The less length of cylinder through which the ball was impelled; for with the eight ounce charge it lay three or four inches nearer to the muzzle of the piece than with the others. 2. The greater quantity of elastic fluid which escaped in this case than in the others by the windage. This happens from its moving with a greater velocity; in consequence of which, a greater quantity escapes by the vent and windage than in smaller velocities. 3. The greater quantity of powder blown out unfired in this case than in that of the lesser velocities; for the ball which was impelled with the greater velocity, would be sooner out of the piece than the others, and the more so as it had a less length of the bore to move through; and if powder fire in time, which cannot be denied, though indeed that time is manifestly very short, a greater quantity of it must remain unfired when the ball with the greater velocity issues from the piece, than when that which has the less velocity goes out, and still the more so as the bulk of powder which was at first to be inflamed in the one case so much exceeded that in the others.\n\nLet us now compare the corresponding velocities in both cases. In the one they are 701, 993, 1397; in the other, 613, 873, 1162. Now the ratio of the first two numbers, or the velocities with two ounces of powder, is that of 1 to 1.1436, the ratio of the next two is that of 1 to 1.1375, and the ratio of the last is that of 1 to 1.2022. But the mean weight of the shot for two and four ounces of powder was 28½ ounces in the first course and 18½ in this; and for eight ounces of powder it was 28½ in the first and 18½ in this. Taking therefore the reciprocal subduplicate ratios of these weights of shot, we obtain the ratio of 1 to 1.224 for that of the balls which were fired with two ounces and four ounces of powder, and the ratio of 1 to 1.241 for the balls which were fired with eight ounces. But the real ratios above found are not greatly different from these; and the variation of the actual velocities from this law of the weights of shot inclines the same way in both courses of experiments. We may now collect into one view the principal inferences that have resulted from these experiments.\n\n1. \"It is evident from them that powder fires almost instantaneously.\n\n2. \"The velocities communicated to balls or shot of the same weight with different quantities of powder, are nearly in the subduplicate ratio of these quantities; a very small variation in defect taking place when the quantities of powder become great.\n\n3. \"When shot of different weights are fired with the same quantity of powder, the velocities communicated to them are nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of their weights.\n\n4. \"Shot which are of different weights, and impelled by different quantities of powder, acquire velocities which are directly as the square roots of the quantities of powder, and inversely as the square roots of the weights of the shot nearly.\n\nThe velocities of the bullets being thus found as nearly as possible, the ranges may be found by the following rules laid down by Mr Robins.\n\n1. \"Till the velocity of the projectile surpasses that of 1100 feet in a second, the resistance may be reckoned to be in the duplicate proportion of the velocity, and its mean quantity may be reckoned about...\"\nbout half an ounce avoirdupois on a 12 pound shot, moving with a velocity of about 25 or 26 feet in a second.\n\n2. If the velocity be greater than that of 1100 or 1200 feet in a second, then the absolute quantity of the resistance in these greater velocities will be near three times as great as it should be by comparison with the smaller velocities.—Hence then it appears, that if a projectile begins to move with a velocity less than that of 1100 feet in 1\", its whole motion may be supposed to be confined on the hypothesis of a resistance in the duplicate ratio of the velocity. And if it begins to move with a velocity greater than this last mentioned, yet if the first part of its motion, till its velocity be reduced to near 1100 feet in 1\", be considered separately from the remaining part in which the velocity is less than 1100 feet in 1\"; it is evident, that both parts may be truly assigned on the same hypothesis; only the absolute quantity of the resistance is three times greater in the first part than in the last. Wherefore, if the motion of a projectile on the hypothesis of a resistance in the duplicate ratio of the velocity be truly and generally assigned, the actual motions of resisted bodies may be thereby determined, notwithstanding the increased resistances in the great velocities. And, to avoid the division of the motion into two, I shall show how to compute the whole at one operation with little more trouble than if no such increased resistance took place.\n\n\"To avoid frequent circumlocutions, the distance to which any projectile would range in a vacuum on the horizontal plane at 45° elevation, I shall call the potential range of that projectile; the distance to which the projectile would range in vacuo on the horizontal plane at any angle different from 45°, I shall call the potential range of the projectile at that angle; and the distance to which a projectile really ranges, I shall call its actual range.\n\n\"If the velocity with which a projectile begins to move is known, its potential range and its potential range at any given angle are easily determined from the common theory of projectiles*; or more generally, if either its original velocity, its potential range, or its potential range, at a given angle, are known, the other two are easily found out.\n\n\"To facilitate the computation of resisted bodies, it is necessary, in the consideration of each resisted body, to assign a certain quantity, which I shall denominate F, adapted to the resistance of that particular projectile. To find this quantity F to any projectile given, we may proceed thus: First find, from the principles already delivered, with what velocity the projectile must move, so that its resistance may be equal to its gravity. Then the height from whence a body must descend in a vacuum to acquire this velocity is the magnitude of F sought. But the simplest way of finding this quantity F to any shell or bullet is this. If it be of solid iron, multiply its diameter measured in inches by 300, the product will be the magnitude of F expressed in yards. If, instead of a solid iron bullet, it is a shell or a bullet of some other substance; then, as the specific gravity of iron is to the specific gravity of the shell or bullet given, so is the F corresponding to an iron bullet of the same diameter to the proper F for the shell or bullet given. The quantity F being thus assigned, the necessary computations of these resisted motions may be dispatched by the three following propositions, always remembering that these propositions proceed on the hypothesis of the resistance being in the duplicate proportion of the velocity of the resisted body. How to apply this principle, when the velocity is so great as to have its resistance augmented beyond this rate, shall be shown in a corollary to be annexed to the first proposition.\n\n| Actual ranges expressed in F | Corresponding potential ranges expressed in F |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 0.01                        | 0.0100                                        |\n| 0.02                        | 0.0201                                        |\n| 0.04                        | 0.0405                                        |\n| 0.06                        | 0.0612                                        |\n| 0.08                        | 0.0822                                        |\n| 0.1                         | 0.1034                                        |\n| 0.12                        | 0.1249                                        |\n| 0.14                        | 0.1468                                        |\n| 0.15                        | 0.1578                                        |\n| 0.2                         | 0.2140                                        |\n| 0.25                        | 0.2722                                        |\n| 0.3                         | 0.3324                                        |\n| 0.35                        | 0.3947                                        |\n| 0.4                         | 0.4591                                        |\n| 0.45                        | 0.5258                                        |\n| 0.5                         | 0.5949                                        |\n| 0.55                        | 0.6664                                        |\n| 0.6                         | 0.7404                                        |\n| 0.65                        | 0.8170                                        |\n| 0.7                         | 0.8964                                        |\n| 0.75                        | 0.9787                                        |\n| 0.8                         | 1.0638                                        |\n| 0.85                        | 1.1521                                        |\n| 0.9                         | 1.2436                                        |\n| 0.95                        | 1.3383                                        |\n| 1.0                         | 1.4366                                        |\n| 1.05                        | 1.5384                                        |\n| 1.1                         | 1.6439                                        |\n| 1.15                        | 1.7534                                        |\n| 1.2                         | 1.8660                                        |\n| 1.25                        | 1.9845                                        |\n| 1.3                         | 2.1066                                        |\n| 1.35                        | 2.2332                                        |\n| 1.4                         | 2.3640                                        |\n| 1.45                        | 2.5008                                        |\n| 1.5                         | 2.6422                                        |\n\n\"PROP. I. Given the actual range of a given shell or bullet at any small angle not exceeding 8° or 10°, to determine its potential range, and consequently its potential range and original velocity.\n\n\"SOL. Let the actual range given be divided by the F corresponding to the given projectile, and find the quote in the first column of the preceding Table: then the corresponding number in the second column multiplied into F will be the potential range sought: and thence, by the methods already explained, the potential range and the original velocity of the projectile is given.\n\n\"EXAM.\"\n**EXAM.** An 18 pounder, the diameter of whose shot is about 5 inches, when loaded with 2 lb. of powder, ranged at an elevation of 3° 30' to the distance of 975 yards.\n\n\"The F corresponding to this bullet is 1500 yards; and the quote of the actual range by this number is 65; corresponding to which, in the second column, is .817; whence 817 F, or 1225 yards, is the potential range sought; and this, augmented in the ratio of the sine of twice the angle of elevation to the radius, gives 10050 yards for the potential random; whence it will be found, that the velocity of this projectile was that of 984 feet in a second.\n\n**Cor. III.** If the converse of this proposition be desired; that is, if the potential range in a small angle be given, and thence the actual range be sought; this may be solved with the same facility by the same table: for if the given potential range be divided by its correspondent F, then opposite to the quote sought in the second column a number which multiplied into F will give the actual range required. And from hence it follows, that if the actual range be given at one angle, it may be found at every other angle not exceeding 8° or 10°.\n\n**Cor. 2d.** If the actual range at a given small angle be given, and another actual range be given, to which the angle is sought; this will be determined by finding the potential ranges corresponding to the two given actual ranges; then the angle corresponding to one of these potential ranges being known, the angle corresponding to the other will be found by the common theory of projectiles.\n\n**Cor. 3d.** If the potential random deduced from the actual range by this proposition exceeds 13000 yards; then the original velocity of the projectile was so great, as to be affected by the treble resistance described above; and consequently the real potential random will be greater than what is here determined. However, in this case, the true potential random may be thus nearly assigned. Take a 4th continued proportional to 13000 yards, and the potential random found by this proposition, and the 4th proportional thus found may be assumed for the true potential random sought.\n\nIn like manner, when the true potential random is given greater than 13000 yards, we must take two mean proportions between 13000 and this random; and the first of these mean proportions must be assumed instead of the random given, in every operation described in these propositions and their corollaries. And this method will nearly allow for the increased resisting to a few minutes in the angle of direction of the projected body, which, provided that angle exceeds two or three degrees, is usually scarce worth attending to.\n\nOf this process take the following example.\n\n\"A 24 pounder fired with 12 pounds of powder, when elevated at 7° 15', ranged about 2500 yards. Here the F being near 1700 yards, the quote to be sought in the first column is 147, to which the number corresponding in the second column is 2.556; whence the potential range is near 4350 yards, and the potential random thence resulting 17400. But this being more than 13000, we must, to get the true potential random, take a 4th continued proportional to 13000 and 17400; and this 4th proportional, which is about 31000 yards, is to be esteemed the true potential random sought; whence the velocity is nearly that of 1730 feet in a second.\n\n**Scholium.** This proposition is confined to small angles, not exceeding 8° or 10°. In all possible cases of practice, this approximation, thus limited, will not differ from the most rigorous solution by so much as what will often intervene from the variation of the density of the atmosphere in a few hours time; so that the errors of the approximation are much short of other inevitable errors, which arise from the nature of this subject.\n\n**PROP. II.** Given the actual range of a given shell or bullet, at any angle not exceeding 45°, to determine its potential range at the same angle; and thence its potential random and original velocity.\n\n\"Sol. Diminish the F corresponding to the shell or bullet given in the proportion of the radius to the cosine of ½ of the angle of elevation. Then, by means of the preceding table, operate with this reduced F in the same manner as is prescribed in the solution of the last proposition, and the result will be the potential range sought; whence the potential random, and the original velocity, are easily determined.\n\n**EXAM.** A mortar for sea-service, charged with 30lb. of powder, has sometimes thrown its shell, of 12½ inches diameter, and of 23½lb. weight, to the distance of 2 miles, or 5450 yards. This at an elevation of 45°.\n\n\"The F to this shell, if it were solid, is 3825 yards; but as the shell is only ¾ of a solid globe, the true F is no more than 3060 yards. This, diminished in the ratio of the radius to the cosine of ¼ of the angle of elevation, becomes 2544. The quote of the potential range by this diminished F is 1.384; which sought in the first column of the preceding table gives 2280 for the corresponding number in the second column; and this multiplied into the reduced F, produces 5800 yards for the potential range sought, which, as the angle of elevation was 45°, is also the potential random; and hence the original velocity of this shell appears to be that of about 748 feet in a second.\n\n**Cor.** The converse of this proposition, that is, the determination of the actual range from the potential range given, is easily deduced from hence by means of the quote of the potential range divided by the reduced F; for this quote searched out in the second column, will give a corresponding number in the first column, which multiplied into the reduced F, will be the actual range sought.\n\nAlso, if the potential random of a projectile be given, or its actual range at a given angle of elevation; its actual range at any other angle of elevation, not greater than 45°, may hence be known. For the potential random will assign the potential range at any given angle; and thence, by the method of this corollary, the actual range may be found.\n\n**EXAM.** A fit musket bullet fired from a piece of the standard dimensions, with ½ of its weight in good powder, acquires a velocity of near 900 feet in a second; that is, it has a potential random of near 8450 yards. If now the actual range of this bullet at 15° was sought, we must proceed thus:\n\n---\n\n*The operations directed in this corollary are best performed by the table since large velocities, the difference only amounting to a few minutes in the angle of direction of the projected body, which, provided that angle exceeds two or three degrees, is usually scarce worth attending to.*\n\n---\n\nVol. X. Part I.\n\"From the given potential random it follows, that the potential range at $15^\\circ$ is 4200 yards; the diameter of the bullet is $\\frac{3}{4}$ of an inch; and thence, as it is of lead, its proper $F$ is 337.5 yards, which, reduced in the ratio of the radius to the cosine of $\\frac{3}{4}$ of $15^\\circ$, becomes 331 yards. The quote of 4200 by this number is 12.7 nearly; which being sought in the second column, gives 3.2 nearly for the corresponding number in the first column; and this multiplied into 331 yards (the reduced $F$) makes 1059 yards for the actual range sought.\n\n\"Exam. II. The same bullet, fired with its whole weight in powder, acquires a velocity of about 2100 feet in a second, to which there corresponds a potential random of about 45700 yards. But this number greatly exceeding 13000 yards, it must be reduced by the method described in the third corollary of the first proposition, when it becomes 19700 yards. If now the actual range of this bullet at $15^\\circ$ be required, we shall from hence find, that the potential range at $15^\\circ$ is 9850 yards; which, divided by the reduced $F$ of the last example, gives for a quote 2975; and thence following the steps prescribed above, the actual range of this bullet comes out 1396 yards, exceeding the former range by no more than 337 yards; whereas the difference between the two potential ranges is above ten miles. Of such prodigious efficacy is the resistance of the air, which hath been hitherto treated as too insignificant a power to be attended to in laying down the theory of projectiles!\n\n\"Schol. I must here observe, that as the density of the atmosphere perpetually varies, increasing and diminishing often by $\\frac{1}{10}$ part, and sometimes more, in a few hours; for that reason I have not been over rigorous in forming these rules, but have considered them as sufficiently exact when the errors of the approximation do not exceed the inequalities which would take place by a change of $\\frac{1}{10}$ part in the density of the atmosphere. With this restriction, the rules of this proposition may be safely applied in all possible cases of practice. That is to say, they will exhibit the true motions of all kinds of shells and cannon-shot, as far as $45^\\circ$ of elevation, and of all musket bullets fired with their largest customary charges, if not elevated more than $30^\\circ$. Indeed, if experiments are made with extraordinary quantities of powder, producing potential randoms greatly surpassing the usual rate; then in large angles some farther modifications may be necessary. And though, as these cases are beyond the limits of all practice, it may be thought unnecessary to consider them; yet, to enable those who are so disposed to examine these uncommon cases, I shall here insert a proposition, which will determine the actual motion of a projectile at $45^\\circ$, how enormoussoever its original velocity may be. But as this proposition will rather relate to speculative than practical cases, instead of supposing the actual range known, thence to assign the potential random, I shall now suppose the potential random given, and the actual range to be thence investigated.\n\n\"Prop. III. Given the potential random of a given shell or bullet; to determine its actual range at $45^\\circ$.\n\nSol. Divide the given potential random by the $F$ corresponding to the shell or bullet given, and call the quotient $q$, and let $l$ be the difference between the tabular logarithms of 25 and of $q$, the logarithm of 10 being supposed unity; then the actual range sought is\n\n$$\\frac{3.4 F + 2}{F} - \\frac{l}{10}$$\n\nwhere the double sine of $\\frac{2}{F}$ is to be thus understood; that if $q$ be less than 25, it must be $-2/F$; if it be greater, then it must be $+2/F$. In this solution, $q$ may be any number not less than 3, nor more than 2500.\n\n\"Cor. Computing in the manner here laid down, we shall find the relation between the potential randoms, and the actual range at $45^\\circ$, within the limits of this proposition, to be as expressed in the following table.\n\n| Potential Randoms | Actual Range at $45^\\circ$ |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| 3 F               | 1.5 F                     |\n| 6 F               | 2.1 F                     |\n| 10 F              | 2.6 F                     |\n| 20 F              | 3.2 F                     |\n| 30 F              | 3.6 F                     |\n| 40 F              | 3.8 F                     |\n| 50 F              | 4.0 F                     |\n| 100 F             | 4.6 F                     |\n| 200 F             | 5.1 F                     |\n| 500 F             | 5.8 F                     |\n| 1000 F            | 6.4 F                     |\n| 2500 F            | 7.0 F                     |\n\nWhence it appears, that, when the potential random is increased from 3 F to 2500 F, the actual range is only increased from 1.5 F to 7 F; so that an increase of 2497 F in the potential random produces no greater an increase in the actual range than 5.5 F, which is not its $\\frac{1}{10}$ part; and this will again be greatly diminished on account of the increased resistance, which takes place in great velocities. So extraordinary are the effects of this resistance, which we have been hitherto taught to regard as inconsiderable.\n\n\"That the justness of the approximations laid down in the 2d and 3d propositions may be easier examined; I shall conclude these computations by inserting a table of the actual ranges at $45^\\circ$ of a projectile, which is refitted in the duplicate proportion of its velocity. This table is computed by methods different from those hitherto described, and is sufficiently exact to serve as a standard with which the result of our other rules may be compared. And since whatever errors occur in the application of the preceding propositions, they will be most sensible at $45^\\circ$ of elevation, it follows, that hereby the utmost limits of those errors may be assigned.\n\n| Potential Randoms | Actual Range at $45^\\circ$ |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| .1 F              | .963 F                    |\n| .25 F             | .2282 F                   |\n| .5 F              | .4203 F                   |\n| .75 F             | .5868 F                   |\n| 1.0 F             | .7323 F                   |\n| 1.25 F            | .860 F                    |\n| 1.5 F             | .978 F                    |\n| 1.75 F            | 1.083 F                   |\n| 2.0 F             | 1.179 F                   |\n| 2.5 F             | 1.349 F                   |\n| 3.0 F             | 1.495 F                   |\n\nPotential...\nWe have now only to consider that part of practical gunnery which relates to the proportions of the different parts of cannon, the metal of which they are made, &c.\n\nFormerly the guns were made of a very great length, and were on that account extremely troublesome and unmanageable. The error here was first discovered by accident; for some cannon, having been cast by mistake two feet and an half shorter than the common standard, were found to be equally efficacious in service with the common ones, and much more manageable. This soon produced very considerable alterations in the form of the artillery throughout Europe; but in no country have greater improvements in this respect been made than in our own. For a long time brass, or rather a kind of bell-metal, was thought preferable to cast iron for making of cannon. The composition of this metal is generally kept a secret by each particular founder. The author of the Military Dictionary gives the following proportions as the most common, viz. \"To 240 lb. of metal fit for casting they put 68 lb. of copper, 52 lb. of brass, and 12 lb. of tin. To 4200 lb. of metal fit for casting, the Germans put 3687½ lb. of copper, 204½ lb. of brass, and 307½ lb. of tin. Others use 100 lb. of copper, 61 lb. of brass, and 9 lb. of tin; while some make use of 100 lb. of copper, 10 lb. of brass, and 15 lb. of tin. This composition was both found to be very expensive, and also liable to great inconveniences in the using. A few years ago, therefore, a proposal was made by Mr Muller for using iron guns of a lighter construction than the brass ones, by which he supposed that a very great saving would be made in the expense; and likewise, that the guns of the new construction would be more manageable, and even efficacious, than the old ones. \"The reduction of the expense (says Mr Muller) of the very large artillery necessary for sea and land service, is to be considered under two heads: the one, To diminish the weight; and the other, Not to use any brass field-artillery, but only Practice.\n\nIron, to lessen the great burden of our ships of war, and to carry larger calibers than those of other nations of the same rate. If the weights of our guns are diminished, they will require fewer hands to manage them, and of consequence a smaller number will be exposed to danger at a time: and if we carry larger calibers, our rates will be a match for larger ships.\n\n\"The advantage of using iron guns in the field instead of brass, will be that the expenses are lessened in proportion to the cost of brass to that of iron, which is as 8 to 1.\n\n\"The only objection against iron is, its pretended brittleness; but as we abound in iron that is stronger and tougher than any brass, this objection is invalid. This I can assert, having seen some that cannot be broken by any force, and will flatten like hammered iron: if then we use such iron, there can be no danger of the guns bursting in the most severe action.\n\n\"Though brass guns are not liable to burst, yet they are sooner rendered unserviceable in action than iron. For by the softness of the metal, the vent widens so soon, and they are so liable to bend at the muzzle, that it would be dangerous to fire them; as we found by experience at Belleisle, and where we were obliged to take guns from the ships to finish the siege.\n\n\"These being undeniable facts, no possible reason can be assigned against using iron guns in both sea and land service, and thereby lessen the expenses of artillery so considerably as will appear by the following tables.\n\nLengths and Weights of Iron Ship-Guns.\n\n| Calib. | Length | Weight |\n|-------|--------|--------|\n|       | Ft.

B. These battering pieces may serve in garrisons.\n\nIt appears from these tables, that no proportion has been observed in any guns hitherto made, in respect to their length or weight, but merely by guess.\n\nSome Examples to show what may be saved by this Scheme.\n\nThe old Royal George carried 100 brass guns, which weighed together 218.2 tons; the ton costs 130 pounds, workmanship included.\n\nThe expense of these guns is then 28366 pounds\n\nA set of iron guns of the same number and calibers, according to my construction, weighs 127.8 tons\n\nThe ton cost 16 pounds, and the whole set 2044.8 pounds\n\nThe Royal George carries then 90.4 tons more than is necessary, and the difference between the expense is 26321.2 pounds\n\nThat is, 12.5 times more than the new iron set costs; or 12 ships of the same rate may be fitted out at less charge.\n\nA set of the Old iron guns for a first rate weighs 204.4 tons\n\nThe difference between the weight of the old and new is 76.6 tons\n\nThe difference between the expense is then 1225.6 pounds\n\nA set of brass battering pieces weighs 11.36 tons\n\nA ton costs 130 pounds, and the set 1476.8 pounds\n\nA set of the new weighs 7.55 tons\n\nThe ton costs 16 pounds, and the set 117.8 pounds\n\nThat is, the old set costs 11 times, and 632 over, more than the new set; or 11 sets of the new could be made at less expense than one of the old.\n\nThis table shows what may be saved in the navy; and if we add those on board ships, the different garisons, and the field train, with the great expense of their carriage in the field, it may be found pretty near as much more.\n\n| Num. of Guns | Weight of Old | Weight of New | Differ. | Num. of Ships | Total Difference |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------------|-----------------|\n| 100          | 4367 3        | 2556 0        | 1811 3  | 5             | 9058 0          |\n| 90           | 3537 3        | 2001 0        | 1536 3  | 9             | 13827 3         |\n| 80           | 3108 3        | 1821 0        | 1287 3  | 7             | 9014 1          |\n| 74           | 3091 0        | 1840 2        | 1250 8  | 32            | 40016 0         |\n| 70           | 2997 0        | 1796 2        | 1200 8  | 10            | 12005 0         |\n| 64           | 2543 3        | 1305 0        | 1238 3  | 30            | 28485 2         |\n| 60           | 2177 3        | 1185 0        | 992 3   | 23            | 29782 2         |\n| 50           | 1881 1        | 1035 0        | 846 1   | 19            | 16078 3         |\n| 44           | 1365 2        | 705 0         | 660 2   | 8             | 5284 0          |\n| 40           | 1234 2        | 312 2         | 922 0   | 9             | 8298 0          |\n| 36           | 903 3         | 450 0         | 513 3   | 7             | 3396 1          |\n| 32           | 956 2         | 435 0         | 521 2   | 28            | 14602 0         |\n| 28           | 593 2         | 285 0         | 308 2   | 23            | 7095 1          |\n| 24           | 531 3         | 255 0         | 276 3   | 12            | 3321 0          |\n| 20           | 421 2         | 191 1         | 230 1   | 15            | 3453 3          |\n\nDifference between the weights 203918 3\n\nExpenses of Brasses guns of two first rates 203918 15\n\nIron ditto 43109 5\n\nWe get L. 257028 0\n\nTo this and other proposals for reducing the weight and expense of guns great attention has been paid; and the Carron Company in Scotland have not only greatly improved those of the old construction, but a gun of a different construction, invented by Mr Charles Galtcogne, formerly director of that work, has been of more effectual service than any hitherto made use of.—Fig. 6. represents the form and proportions of the guns made at Carron, and CCXLVIII. which serve for those of all sizes, from one-half pounders and upwards. The proportions are measured by the diameters of the caliber, or bore of the gun, divided into 16 equal parts, as represented in the figure. The following are the names of the different parts of a cannon.\n\nAB, the length of the cannon.\nAE, the first reinforce.\nEF, the second reinforce.\nFB, the chafe.\nHB, the muzzle.\nAO, the caftacle, or pomiglion.\nAC, the breech.\nCD, the vent-field.\nFI, the chafe-girdle.\nRS, the base-ring and ogee.\nT, the vent-fragal and fillets.\nPG, the first reinforce-ring and ogee.\nVW, the second reinforce-ring and ogee.\nX, the chafe-fragal and fillets.\nThe dotted lines along the middle of the piece show the dimensions of the caliber, and the dotted circle shows the size of the ball. Fig. 7 shows a cannon made also at Carron, and which may be measured by the same scale.\n\nAs the breech of the cannon receives an equal impulse with the bullet from the action of the inflamed gunpowder, it thence follows, that at the moment the bullet flies off, the piece itself pushes backward with very great force. This is called the recoil of the cannon; and if the piece is not of a very considerable weight, it would fly upwards, or to a side, with extreme violence. If again it was firmly fastened down, so that it could not move in the least, it would be very apt to burst, on account of the extreme violence with which the powder would then act upon it. For this reason it hath been found necessary to allow the recoil to take place, and consequently all large pieces of artillery are mounted upon carriages with wheels, which allow them to recoil freely; and thus they may be fired without any danger. There are several sorts of carriages for ordnance, viz. bastard carriages, with low wheels and high wheels; sea-carriages, made in imitation of those for ship-guns; and carriages for field-pieces, of which there are two kinds. The carriages must be proportioned to the pieces mounted on them. The ordinary proportion is for the carriage to have once and a half the length of the gun, the wheels to be half the length of the piece in height. Four times the diameter or caliber gives the depth of the planks in the fore end; in the middle \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nFig. 8 shows the gun called a carronade* invented or rather improved by Mr Gafoigne; and which, in June 1779, was by the king and council instituted a standard navy-gun, and 10 of them appointed to be added to each ship of war, from a first-rate to a sloop. Of this gun the Carron Company have published the following account.\n\n\"The carronade is made so short, that it is worked with its carriage in the ship's port; the trunnions lying immediately over the fill of the port; it is correctly bored; and the shot being perfectly round, fills the caliber with such exactness, that the least possible of the impulse of the powder escapes, upon explosion, between the cylinder and the shot; which last also is thereby more truly directed in its flight. The bottom of the cylinder is a hemisphere, to which the end of the cartridge is not liable to stick, and in which the smallest charge of powder envelopes the shot, exhausting nearly the whole of its impelling force upon it; the trunnions are placed so as to lessen the recoil, and that the gun cannot rest against the sides of the carriage, and is balanced with the utmost facility. There are views cast upon the vent and muzzle, to point the gun quickly to an object at 250 and 500 yards distance. There is a handle fixed upon the pommel-end of the gun, by which it is horizontally ranged and pointed; and there is a ring cast upon the calebail, through which the breech rope is reeved, the only rope used about these guns.\n\n\"The carronade is mounted upon a carriage B, with a perfectly smooth bottom of strong plank, without trucks; instead of which there is fixed on the bottom of the carriage, perpendicular from the trunnions, a gudgeon C of proper strength, with an iron washer D and pin E at the lower end thereof. This gudgeon is let into a corresponding groove F, cut in a second carriage G, called a slide-carriage; the washer supported by the pin over-reaching the under edges of the groove H. This slide-carriage is made with a smooth upper surface, upon which the gun-carriage is moved, and by the gudgeon always kept in its right station to the port; the groove in the slide-carriage being of sufficient length to allow the gun to recoil and be loaded within board. The slide-carriage, the groove included, is equally broad with the fore part of the gun-carriage, and about four times the length; the fore part of the slide-carriage is fixed by hinge-bolts I, to the quick-work of the ship below the port, the end lying over the fill, close to the outside plank, and the groove reaching to the fore end; the gudgeon of the gun-carriage, and consequently the trunnions of the gun, are over the fill of the port when the gun is run out; and the port is made of such breadth, with its sides bevelled off within board, that the gun and carriage may range from bow to quarter. The slide-carriage is supported from the deck at the hinder end, by a wedge K, or step-stool; which being altered at pleasure, and the fore end turning upon the hinge-bolts, the carriage can be constantly kept upon a horizontal plane, for the more easy and quick working of the gun when the ship lies along.\n\n\"The gun and carriages being in their places, the breech rope, which must be strong and limber, is reeved through the ring on the breech, then led through an eye-bolt drove downwards, the eye standing upright upon the upper edge of each cheek of the gun-carriage; from these eye-bolts the ends of the breech rope are seized down as usual to an eye-bolt driven into the quick-work on each side, in a line with the lower surface of the slide-carriage.\n\n\"The gun being mounted and ready for action, is loaded with one-twelfth part of the weight of its ball in service charge of powder put into a woollen cartridge, and the end tied up with a worsted yarn, and placed next to the shot; and with a single ball, well rammed home upon the powder, without a wadding between them: the gun being then run out in the port, is ranged and elevated with great facility, by means of the handle on the pommel; and, by the views, very quickly pointed.—Upon discharge, the gun attempts to kick upwards, which being prevented by the washer of the gudgeon bearing hard against the under part of the slide-carriage, the recoil takes place; and the gudgeon sliding backwards in the groove (the washer still bearing against an iron plate on the under edge of the groove), till the gun is brought up by the breech rope, as much reaction succeeds as slackens the rope, so that the gun and carriage may be instantly turned fore and aft by the handle, and loaded again.\n\n\"This gun has many singular advantages over the others...\"\nothers of light construction.—It is so extremely light, that the smallest ships can carry almost any weight of shot (the 12 pounder weighing under 500 wt. and the other calibers in proportion), and that without being attended with the inconveniences imputed generally to light guns, since it cannot injure its carriage, or jump out of its station in the port upon recoil; and it will never heat.\n\n\"It can be easily managed and worked of all calibers, from the 12 pounders downwards with two hands, and the 18 and 24 pounders with three hands. It may be readily ranged, pointed, and discharged, twice in three minutes, which doubles the strength of the ship against an enemy of equal force. It is wrought upon a horizontal plane to windward or to leeward how much ever the ship lies along under a prelude of foul; and therefore, besides being hampered with no tackles or other ropes, except the breech rope, it may be worked with as much ease and expedition in chase or in a gale of wind as in lying to for action.—It can be ranged from bow to quarter, so as to bring a broadside to bear in a circuit of above 10 points of the compass on each side.—It is no more expensive in ammunition than the old guns of two-thirds less weight of shot; and it requires very few hands above the complement necessary for navigating merchant-ships; and increases the strength of privateers crews, by exposing few hands at the guns, and augmenting the number at small arms.\n\n\"Though the carronade cannot, strictly speaking, throw its shot to an equal distance with a longer gun; yet, from the finnels of the thor to its cylinder, the powers of this gun will greatly surpass the expectations of such as are not intimately acquainted with the effects of the elastic force of fired powder, since, with one-twelfth part of the weight of its ball, at very small elevations, it will range its shot to triple the distance at which ships generally engage, with sufficient velocity for the greatest execution, and with all the accuracy in its direction that can be attained from guns of greater lengths.\n\n\"There have been two seeming disadvantages imputed to this gun, which it does not merit, viz. the nicety of fitting the shot to the bore of the gun, and its incapacity to hold more than two shot at one charge. But as seamen have few opportunities of confirming themselves in just opinions by experiments made on shore, and cannot, in that case, be fully conversant with the subject; the following loose hints may not be inept towards removing these objections.\n\n\"It is an axiom in projectiles, That a shot cannot be impelled from a gun to any distance in a direction truly parallel to the axis of the cylinder of the piece, or what is commonly called point blank, arising from several well known causes: for, however just may be the cylinder, and however perfect and smooth may be the sphere of its corresponding shot, and admitting that the impulse of the powder acts through the centre of gravity of the shot, and also that the shot consequently leaves the piece in a direction parallel to the axis of its cylinder; yet the shot is no sooner discharged, but it becomes more or less inflected by its gravity, and deflected, according to its velocity, by the repulsion of the air and wind.\n\n\"These irregularities are of little importance in close sea-fights, and being the effect of natural causes are common to all. Besides these, the deviation of a shot from its true direction, is further augmented by the windage between the cylinder and its shot; but the greatest uncertainty in the flight of a shot, making allowance for the action of its gravity, and the air's repulsion, springs from the defects of the shot itself. Round-shot for ship-guns are seldom nicely examined; and, unless they are cast solid and truly globular, and free of all hollows, roughness, and other outside blemishes, and well fitted to the gun, it cannot even be discharged in the direction of the axis of the piece; to the disappointment of those that use them and to the discredit of the gun-founder, however justly the piece is viewed, or disparaged; but being impelled against the surface of the cylinder, bounds and rebounds from side to side, acquires a rotatory motion, and when cast hollow withal, and breaking within the cylinder before discharge, (which sometimes happens, especially with double charges), never fails to injure, and when often repeated may at last burst, the very best guns. Round-shot should not be taken on board a ship, without being examined as to its shape and surface, gaged for its size to the caliber of the gun, and weighed that it be not above or below the standard more than half an ounce in the pound of its respective caliber: good shot then, being of the same importance to all guns, removes the first objection.\n\n\"If the direction of the flight of a shot to its object is affected by so many seeming trivial causes, how much more uncertain must it be, when two or more shot are discharged together from one gun: for the shot next the powder being impelled with more celerity than that immediately before it, strikes against it after discharge, and sometimes shivers itself to pieces, and never fails to change obliquely the direction of both; and this happens with round and double-headed, &c. and all double charges; and which, from their various figures, cannot reach an object at the same elevations with the round-shot; especially when these other shots are of greater weight than the round, which is often the case. However frightful a broadside with double charges may appear at sea, more confusion is created by them, and more time lost, within board, by the strain and excessive recoil, than real damage done without board by the additional charge: for upon a trial on shore, where the effect can be traced, it will be found, that, at 100 yards distance, more shot will take place within a small compass by single than by double charges; and the charges will be oftener repeated in a given time, without heating the gun: and these facts being established, remove also the second objection.\"\n\nThe following account of the proof of one of these guns will perhaps serve to give a more adequate idea of the great usefulness of them, than any description:\n\n\"On Monday, Oct. 4, 1779, there was an experiment made at Carron, before the earl of Dummore, &c. &c. with a 68 pounder carronade, nearly of the weight of a British navy 12-pounder gun, and charged with the same quantity, (viz. 6lb.) of powder.—The carronade was mounted, on its proper carriages, into a port of the dimensions of a 74 gun ship's lower deck-port; was pointed without elevation, at a centre of eight inches diameter, marked on a bulk's head of the thickness...\"\nPractice, thicknesses of two feet five inches solid wood, at 163 yards distance; behind which, at 168 yards, there was another bulk's head of two feet four inches thick; and behind that again, at 170 yards distance, a bank of earth. The shot pierced the bulk's heads each time, and was buried from three to four feet into the bank, and the splinters were thrown about to a considerable distance on all sides.\n\n| Shot | Distance Below Horizontal Line | From Mark |\n|------|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| 1st  | 1 foot 7 inches                | 5 feet    |\n| 2nd  | 2 feet                         | ditto     |\n| 3rd  | through the horizontal line   | ditto     |\n| 4th  | ditto                          | ditto     |\n| 5th  | ditto                          | ditto     |\n| 6th  | 2 inches below                 | do        |\n| 7th  | touched the lower part of ditto| do        |\n| 8th  | 2 inches below                 | do        |\n| 9th  | 2 feet below                   | do        |\n| 10th | 3 inches below                 | do        |\n\n\"The cannonade was laid each time by the views without an instrument; and the shot were all to the left of the mark, owing to a small error in dispersing the views; the third, fourth, and fifth shot, made one fracture, as did also sixth, seventh, and eighth, and the sixth and eighth struck the same spot.\"\n\n\"The cannonade was easily worked with four men, and may be readily worked and discharged on board a ship twice a minute with six men.—With five pounds weight of powder the shot was impelled with a velocity of 1400 feet a second.\"\n\nWe have already seen of how much consequence rifle-barrels are in order to bring the art of gunnery to perfection; as they enlarge the space in which the ball will fly without any lateral deflection to three or four times its usual quantity. This improvement, however, till very lately, only took place in musket-barrels. But in the beginning of the year 1774, Dr Lind, and Captain Alexander Blair of the 69th regiment of foot, invented a species of rifled field-pieces. They are made of cast iron, and are not bored like the common pieces, but have the rifles moulded on the core, after which they are cleaned out and finished with proper instruments.\n\nGuns of this construction, which are intended for the field, ought never to be made to carry a ball of above one or two pounds weight at most; a leaden bullet of that weight being sufficient to destroy either man or horse.—A pound gun, of this construction, of good metal, such as is now made by the Carron Company, need not weigh above an hundred pounds weight, and its carriage about another hundred. It can therefore be easily transported from place to place, by a few men; and a couple of good horses may transport six of these guns and their carriages, if put into a cart.\n\nBut, for making experiments, in order to determine the resistance which bodies moving with great velocities meet with from the air, a circumstance to which these guns are particularly well adapted, or for annoying an enemy's flappers that are carrying on their approaches towards a besieged place, a larger caliber may be used.\n\nThe length of the gun being divided into seven equal parts, the length of the first reinforce AB is two of these parts; the second BC, one and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the diameter of the caliber; the chafe CD, four wanting \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of the diameter of the caliber.\n\nThe distance from the hind part of the base-ring A to the beginning of the bore, is one caliber and \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of a caliber. The trunnions TT are each a caliber in breadth, and the same in length; their centres are placed three-sevenths of the gun's length from the hind part of the base ring, in such a manner that the axis of the trunnions passes through the centre line of the bore, which prevents the gun from kicking, and breaking its carriage.

From some experiments of Colonel Defaguliers and Mr Muller, it has been imagined, that the powder never has so strong an effect as when it is fired close to the bottom of the bore; yet it is found, by the experiments of Count de la Lippe, to have the greatest effect when fired near to the middle of the charge. This he proved by firing it with tubes, introduced at a vent bored through the button and breech of the gun, of different lengths, so as to reach the different parts of the powder. In the same manner, a musket or fowling-piece is found to push more when the touch-hole is placed at some little distance from the bottom of the bore; which arises from nothing but the powder's acting with more force, by being inflamed to greater advantage; consequently, in this case, the same quantity of powder will have a greater effect, than when the touch-hole is placed at the bottom of the bore, which may be of some use in husbanding the powder.\n\nThe above dimensions are taken from some elegant one half pound guns, which were made for the prince of Asturias by the Carron Company.\n\nThe rifles make one spiral turn in the length of the bore; but go no nearer to the breech, in their full size, than two calibers; and then terminate with a gentle slope in half a caliber more, so as not to prevent the cartridge with the powder from being easily sent home to the bottom of the gun, which would otherwise constantly happen with the flannel cartridges, and even sometimes with paper ones, if not made to enter very loofely. The shape of the rifles is semicircular, their breadth being equal to the diameter, which is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a caliber, and their depth equal to the semidiameter, or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a caliber.\n\nThe bullets, fig. 10, are of lead, having six knobs cast on them to fit the rifles of the gun. Being thus made of soft metal, they do not injure the rifles; and may also save an army the trouble of carrying a great quantity of shot about with them, since a supply of lead may be had in most countries from roots, &c., which can be cast into balls as occasion requires. Lead likewise being of greater specific gravity than cast iron, flies to a much greater distance.\n\nRifled ordnance of any caliber may be made to carry iron-shot for battering or for other purposes; provided holes, that are a little wider at their bottoms than at their upper parts, be cast in a zone round the ball, for receiving afterwards leaden knobs to fit the rifles of the cannon; by which means, the iron-shot will have its intended line of direction preserved, without injuring the rifles more than if the whole ball was of lead, the rotatory motion round its axis, in the line of its direction (which corrects the aberration) being communicated to it by the leaden knobs, following the spiral turn of the rifles in its progress out of the gun. It is particularly to be observed, that the balls must be made to go easily down into the piece, so that the cartridge with the powder and the bullet may be both sent home together, with a single push of the hand, without any wadding above either powder or ball; by which means, the gun is quickly loaded, and the ball flies farther than when it is forcibly driven into the gun, as practice was found from many experiments. The only reason why, in common rifled muskets, the bullets are rammed in forcibly, is this, that the zone of the ball which is contiguous to the inside of the bore may have the figure of the rifles impressed upon it, in such a manner as to become part of a male screw, exactly fitting the indents of the rifle, which is not at all necessary in the present case, the figure of the rifles being originally cast upon the ball. These knobs retard the flight of the bullet in some degree; but this small disadvantage is fully made up by the ease with which the gun is loaded, its service being nearly as quick as that of a common field-piece; and the retardation and quantity of the whirling motion which is communicated to the bullet being constantly the same, it will not, in the least affect the experiments made with them, in order to determine the resistance of the air.\n\nIn order to hit the mark with greater certainty than can be done in the common random method, these telescope guns are furnished with a sector, the principal parts of which are, 1. The limb, which is divided in such a manner as to show elevations to 15 or 20 degrees. The kind of length of the radius is five inches and an half, and its nonius is so divided as to show minutes of a degree. 2. The telescope, AB, fig. 11, an achromatic refractor, is seven inches in length (such as is used on Hadley's quadrants, that are fitted for taking distances of the moon from the sun or stars, in order to obtain the longitude at sea), having cro's hairs in it. 3. The parallel cylindric bar, CD, is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) of an inch in diameter, having two rectangular ends EF, each half an inch square and an inch long. On one side of the end next the limb of the sector, is a mark corresponding to a similar one in the hinder cock of the gun, with which it must always coincide when placed on the gun. The length of the parallel bar, together with its ends, is seven inches. The bar is fixed to the sector by means of two hollow cylinders, G, H, which allow the sector a motion round the bar. There is a finger-screw a upon the hollow cylinder G, which is fit, in order to tighten it at pleasure upon the bar. 4. The circular level I, fig. 11, and 12, for setting the plane of the sector always perpendicular when placed upon the gun, is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of an inch in diameter. There is a small screw d, to adjust the level at right angles to the plane of the sector. 5. The finger screw b, for fixing the index of the sector at any particular degree of elevation proposed.\n\nThe line of collimation (that is, the line of vision cut by the intersecting point of the two cro's hairs in the telescope) must be adjusted truly parallel to the bar of the sector when at 0 degrees. This is done by placing the sector so that the vertical hair may exactly cover some very distant perpendicular line. If it again covers it when the sector is inverted, by turning it half round upon the bar, which has all the while been kept steady and firm, that hair is correct; if not, correct half the error by means of the small screws, c d e, fig. 11 and 13, at the eye-end of the telescope, and the other half by moving the bar; place it again to cover the perpendicular line, and repeat the above operation till the hair covers it in both positions of the sector. Then turn the sector, till the horizontal hair co-\nPractice, ver the same perpendicular line; and turning the sector half round on its bar, correct it, if wrong, in the same manner as you did the vertical hair.\n\nN.B. Of the four small screws at the eye-end of the telescope, those at the right and left hand move whatever hair is vertical, and those at top or underneath move whatever hair is horizontal.\n\nOn the side of the gun upon the first reinforce, are cast two knobs, F, fig. 9. and 14., having their middle part distant from each other five inches, for fixing on the brass-locks, A, fig. 14. and 15., which receive the rectangular ends of the parallel cylindric bar of the sector, when placed on the gun.\n\nThe next adjustment is to make the parallel bar, and line of collimation of the telescope, when set at 0 degrees, parallel to the bore of the gun, and consequently to the direction of the shot. The gun being loaded, the cartridge pricked, and the gun primed, place the sector on the cocks of the gun; and having first set the sector to what elevation you judge necessary, bring the intersection of the cross hairs in the telescope upon the centre of the mark, the limb of the sector being set vertical by means of the circular level, and then take off the sector without moving the gun. Fire the gun; and if the bullet hits anywhere in the perpendicular line, passing through the centre of the mark, the line of collimation of the telescope and direction of the shot agree: but if it hit to the right of the mark, so much do they differ. In order to correct which, bring the gun into the same position it was in before firing, and secure it there. Then file away as much of the fore cock, on the side next the gun, as will let the intersection of the cross-hair fall somewhere on the line passing perpendicularly through the point where the shot fell; and it is then adjusted in that position, so much being filed off the side of the cock at a, fig. 14. and 15., as will allow the side b to be screwed closer, that the ends of the parallel bar may have no shake in the cocks. To correct it in the other position, and so to find the true 0 degrees of the gun, that is, to bring the line of collimation of the telescope, parallel bar, and bore of the gun, truly parallel to each other, repeat the above with the trunnions perpendicular to the horizon, the sector being turned a quarter round upon its bar, so as to bring its plane vertical. The deviation of the shot found in this way is corrected by deepening one of the cocks, so that the vertical hair of the telescope may be brought to cover the line passing perpendicularly through the point where the bullet hits; the gun being placed in the same position it was in before it was fired. This adjustment being repeated two or three times, and any error that remains being corrected, the gun is fit to be mounted on its carriage for service. It is to be observed, that this sector will fit any gun, if the cocks and rectangular ends, &c. of the parallel bar be of the above dimensions, and will be equally applicable to all such pieces whose cocks have been adjusted, as if it had been adjusted separately with each of them. And if the sector be set at any degree of elevation, and the gun moved so as to bring the intersection of the cross-hairs on the object to be fired at (the limb of the sector being vertical), the bore of the gun will have the same elevation above it, in the true direction of the shot, whatever position the carriage of the gun is standing in. A telescope with cross hairs, fixed to a common rifled musket, and adjusted to the direction of the shot, will make any person, with a very little practice, hit an object with more precision than the most experienced marksman.\n\nFor garrison service, or for batteries, the ship or Their carriage, with two iron staples on each side to rigges, put through a couple of poles to carry these guns from place to place with more dispatch, are as proper as any. But, for the field, a carriage like that at fig. 16., where the shafts push in upon taking out the iron pins a b, and moving the cross bar A, upon which the breech of the gun rests, as far down as the shafts were pushed in, is the properest, since the whole can then be carried like a hand-barrow, over ditches, walls, or rough ground, all which may be easily understood from the figure.\n\nThe principal advantage that will accrue from the use of rifled ordnance, is the great certainty with which any object may be hit when fired at with them, since the shot deviates but little from its intended line of direction, and the gun is capable of being brought to bear upon the object, with great exactness, by means of the telescope and cross-hairs.\n\nThe other pieces of artillery commonly made use of are mortars, howitzers, and royals. The mortars are a kind of short cannon of a large bore, with chambers for the powder, and are made of brass or iron. Their use is to throw hollow shells filled with powder, which falling on any building, or into the works of a fortification, burst, and with their fragments destroy everything near them. Carcasses are also thrown out of them; which are a sort of shells with five holes, filled with pitch and other materials, in order to set buildings on fire; and sometimes baskets full of stones, of the size of a man's fist, are thrown out of them upon an enemy placed in the covert-way in the time of a siege. The ingenious General Defaguliers contrived to throw bags filled with grape-shot, containing in each bag from 400 to 600 shot of different dimensions, out of mortars. The effect of these is tremendous to troops forming the line of battle, passing a defile, or landing, &c. the shot pouring down like a shower of hail on a circumference of above 300 feet.\n\nMortars are chiefly distinguished by the dimensions of their bore; for example, a 13-inch mortar is one the diameter of whose bore is 13 inches, &c.—The land-mortars are those used in sieges, and in battles. They are mounted on beds, and both mortar and bed are transported on block carriages. There is likewise a kind of land-mortars mounted on travelling carriages, invented by Count Buckeburgh, which may be elevated to any degree; whereas all the English mortars are fixed to an angle of 45°. This custom, however, does not appear to have any foundation in reason. In a siege, shells should never be thrown with an angle of 45 degrees, excepting one case only; that is, when the battery is so far off, that they cannot otherwise reach the works: for when shells are thrown out of the trenches into the works of a fortification, or from the town into the trenches, they should have as little elevation as possible, in order not to bury themselves, but to roll along the ground, whereby they do much more damage, and occasion a much greater con-\n\nVol. X. Part I.\nThere are other kinds of mortars, called partridge-mortars, hand-mortars, and firelock-mortars; which last are also called bombards. The partridge-mortar is a common one, surrounded with 13 other little mortars bored round its circumference, in the body of the metal; the middle one is loaded with a shell, and the others with grenades. The vent of the large mortar being fired, communicates its fire to the rest; so that both the shell and grenades go off at once. Hand-mortars were frequently used before the invention of howitzers. They were fixed at the end of a staff four feet and a half long, the other end being fixed with iron to stick in the ground; and while the bombardier with one hand elevated it at pleasure, he fired it with the other.\n\nThe firelock-mortars, or bombards, are small mortars fixed to the end of a firelock. They are loaded as all common firelocks are; and the grenade, placed in the mortar at the end of the barrel, is discharged by a flint-lock. To prevent the recoil hurting the bombardier, the bombard rests on a kind of halberd made for that purpose.\n\nThe chamber in mortars is the place where the powder is lodged. They are of different forms, and made variously by different nations; but the cylindric seems to be preferable to any other form.\n\nThe howitzer is a kind of mortar mounted on a field-carriage like a gun: it differs from the common mortars in having the trunnions in the middle, whereas those of the mortar are at the end. The construction of howitzers is as various and uncertain as that of mortars, excepting that the chambers are all cylindric. They are distinguished by the diameter of their bore; for instance, a 10-inch howitzer is that which has a bore of 10 inches diameter, and so of others. They were much more lately invented than mortars, and indeed are plainly derived from them.\n\nRoyals are a kind of small mortars, which carry a shell whose diameter is 5.5 inches. They are mounted on beds in the same way as other mortars.\n\nFig. 17 represents a mortar; and the names of its parts are as follow:\n\n- **AB**, the whole length of the mortar.\n- **AC**, the muzzle.\n- **CD**, chafe.\n- **DE**, reinforce.\n- **EF**, breech.\n- **GH**, trunnions.\n- **a**, vent.\n- **b**, dolphin.\n- **c d**, vent-alfragal and fillets.\n- **d e**, breech-ring and ogee.\n- **f g**, reinforce-ring and ogee.\n- **g h**, reinforce-alfragal and fillets.\n- **i k**, muzzle-alfragal and fillets.\n- **k l**, muzzle-ring and ogee.\n- **l m**, muzzle-mouldings.\n- **n**, shoulders.\n\n**Interior parts.**\n\n- **o**, chamber.\n- **p**, bore.\n- **q**, mouth.\n- **r**, vent.\n\nThe mortar-beds are formed of very solid timber, and placed upon very strong wooden frames, fixed in such a manner that the bed may turn round. The fore part of these beds is an arc of a circle described from the centre on which the whole turns.\n\nThere are several instruments employed in loading cannon. The names of these are as follow:\n\n1. **The lantern or ladle**, which serves to carry the cannon-powder into the piece, and which consists of two parts, viz. of a wooden box, appropriated to the caliber of the piece for which it is intended, and of a caliber and a half in length with its vent; and of a piece of copper nailed to the box, at the height of a half caliber.—This lantern must have three calibers and a half in length, and two calibers in breadth, being rounded at the end to load the ordinary pieces.\n\n2. **The rammer** is a round piece of wood, commonly called a box, fastened to a stick 12 feet long, for the pieces from 12 to 33 pounders; and 10 for the 8 and 4 pounders; which serve to drive home the powder and ball to the breech.\n\n3. **The sponge** is a long staff or rammer, with a piece of sheep or lamb-skin wound about its end, to serve for scouring the cannon when discharged, before it be charged with fresh powder; to prevent any spark of fire from remaining in her, which would endanger the life of him who should load her again.\n\n4. **Wad-screw** consists of two points of iron turned serpent-wise, to extract the wad out of the pieces when one wants to unload them, or the dirt which had chanced to enter into it.\n\n5. **The botefeux** are sticks two or three feet long, and an inch thick, split at one end, to hold an end of the match twisted round it, to fire the cannon.\n\n6. **The priming iron** is a pointed iron rod, to clear the touch-hole of the pieces of powder or dirt; and also to pierce the cartridge, that it may sooner take fire.\n\n7. **The primer**, which must contain a pound of powder at least, to prime the pieces.\n\n8. **The quoins of mire**, which are pieces of wood with a notch on the side to put the fingers on, to draw them back or push them forward when the gunner points his piece. They are placed on the sole of the carriage.\n\n9. **Leaden plates**, which are used to cover the touch-hole, when the piece is charged, lest some dirt should enter it and stop it.\n\nBefore charging the piece, it is well sponged, to clean it of all filth and dirt withinside; then the proper weight of gunpowder is put in and rammed down; care being taken that the powder be not bruised in ramming, which weakens its effect; it is then run over by a little quantity of paper, hay, or the like; and lastly, the ball is thrown in.\n\nTo point, level, or direct the piece, so as to play against any certain point, is done by the help of a quadrant.\nSect. III.\n\nGUNNERY.\n\nPractice. drant with a plummet: which quadrant consists of two branches made of brass or wood; one about a foot long, eight lines broad, and one line in thickness; the other four inches long, and the same thickness and breadth as the former. Between these branches is a quadrant, divided into 90 degrees, beginning from the shorter branch, and furnished with thread and plummet.\n\nThe longest branch of this instrument is placed in the cannon's mouth, and elevated or lowered till the thread cuts the degree necessary to hit the proposed object. Which done, the cannon is primed, and then set fire to. The method by the sector, however, proposed by Dr Lind, is certainly in all cases to be preferred.\n\nA 24 pounder may very well fire 90 or 100 shots every day in summer, and 60 or 75 in winter. In case of necessity it may fire more; and some French officers of artillery affirn us, that they have caused such a piece to fire every day 150 shots in a siege.—A 16 and a 12 pounder fire a little more, because they are easier served. There have even been some occasions where 200 shots have been fired from these pieces in the space of nine hours, and 138 in the space of firing. In quick firing, tubes are made use of. They are made of tin; and their diameter is two-tenths of an inch, being just sufficient to enter into the vent of the piece. They are about six inches long, with a cap above, and cut slanting below, in the form of a pen; the point is strengthened with some folder, that it may pierce the cartridge without bending. Through this tube is drawn a quick-match, the cap being fitted with mealed powder moistened with spirits of wine. To prevent the mealed powder from falling out by carriage, a cap of paper or flannel steeped in spirits of wine is tied over it. To range pieces in a battery, care must be taken to reconnoitre well the ground where it is to be placed, and the avenues to it. The pieces must be armed each with two lanterns or ladles, a rammer, a sponge, and two priming-irons. The battery must also be provided with carriages, and other implements, necessary to remount the pieces which the enemy should chance to dismount.\n\nTo serve expeditiously and safely a piece in a battery, it is necessary to have to each a sack of leather, large enough to contain about 20 pounds of powder to charge the lanterns or ladles, without carrying them to the magazine; and to avoid thereby making those trains of powder in bringing back the lantern from the magazine, and the accidents which frequently happen thereby.\n\nA battery of three pieces must have 30 gabions, because five are employed on each of the two sides or epaulets, which make 12, and nine for each of the two merlons.\n\nThere ought to be two gunners and six soldiers to each piece, and an officer of artillery.\n\nThe gunner posted on the right of the piece must take care to have always a pouch full of powder and two priming irons: his office is to prime the piece, and load it with powder. The gunner on the left fetches the powder from the little magazine, and fills the lantern or ladle which his comrade holds; after which, he takes care that the match be very well lighted, and ready to set fire to the piece at the first command of the officer.\n\nThere are three soldiers on the right and three on the left of the piece. The two first take care to ram and sponge the piece, each on his side. The rammer and sponge are placed on the left, and the lantern or ladle on the right. After having rammed well the wad put over the powder and that put over the bullet, they then take each a handspike, which they pass between the foremost spokes of the wheel, the ends whereof will pass under the head of the carriage, to make the wheel turn round, leaning on the other end of the handspike, towards the embrasure.\n\nIt is the office of the second soldier on the right to provide wad, and to put it into the piece, as well over the powder as over the bullet; and that of his comrade on the left to provide 50 bullets, and every time the piece is to be charged to fetch one of them and put it into the piece after the powder has been rammed. Then they both take each an handspike, which they pass under the hind part of the wheel, to push it in battery.\n\nThe officer of artillery must take care to have the piece diligently served.\n\nIn the night he must employ the gunners and soldiers, who shall relieve those who have served 24 hours, to repair the embrasures.\n\nIf there be no water near the battery, care must be taken to have a cask filled with it, in which to dip the sponges and cool the pieces every 10 or 12 rounds.\n\nThe carriage for a mortar of 12 inches diameter must be 6 feet long, the flanks 12 inches long and 10 thick. The trunions are placed in the middle of the carriage.\n\nThe carriage of an 18 inch mortar must be 4 feet long, and the flanks 11 inches high and 6 thick.\n\nTo mount the mortars of new invention, they use carriages of cast iron.\n\nIn Germany, to mount mortars from 8 to 9 inches, Method of carry them into the field, and execute them horizontally as a piece of cannon, they make use of a piece of wood 8 feet 2 inches long, with a hole in the middle to lodge the body of the mortar and its trunions as far as their half diameter, and mounted on two wheels four feet high, to which they join a vantrain proportioned to it, and made like those which serve to the carriages of cannons.\n\nHaving mounted the mortar on its carriage, the next thing is to caliber the bomb by means of a great caliber, the two branches whereof embrace the whole circumference of the bomb: these two branches are brought on a rule where the different calibers are marked, among which that of the bomb is found.\n\nIf no defect be found in the bomb, its cavity is filled, by means of a funnel, with whole gunpowder; a little space or liberty is left, that when a fusee or wooden tube, of the figure of a truncated cone, is driven through the aperture (with a wooden mallet, not an iron one for fear of accident), and fastened with a cement made of quicklime, ashes, brick-dust, and steel-fillings, worked together in a glutinous water, or of four parts of pitch, two of colophony, one of turpentine, and one of wax, the powder may not be bruised. This tube is filled with a combustible matter made of two ounces\nounces of nitre, one of sulphur, and three or more of gunpowder dust well rammed. See FUZEE.\n\nThis fuse set on fire burns slowly till it reaches the gunpowder, which goes off at once, bursting the shell to pieces with incredible violence. Special care, however, must be taken that the fuse be proportioned so that the gunpowder do not take fire ere the shell arrives at the defined place; to prevent which, the fuse is frequently wound round with a wet clammy thread.\n\nBatteries consist,—1. Of an epaulement to shelter the mortars from the fire of the enemy. 2. Of platforms on which the mortars are placed. 3. Of small magazines of powder. 4. Of a boyau, which leads to the great magazine. 5. Of ways which lead from the battery to the magazine of bombs. 6. Of a great ditch before the epaulement. 7. Of a berm or retraite.\n\nThe platforms for mortars of 12 inches must have 9 feet in length and 6 in breadth.—The lamboords for common mortars must be four inches thick; those of a concave chamber of 8lb. of powder, 5 inches; those of 12lb. 6 inches; those of 18lb. 7 inches or thereabouts. Their length is at discretion, provided there be enough to make the platforms 9 feet long.—The fore part of the platform will be situated at two feet distance from the epaulement of the battery.—The bombardiers, to shelter themselves in their battery, and not be seen from the town besieged, raise an epaulement of 7 feet or more high, which epaulement has no embrasures.\n\nTo serve expeditiously a mortar in battery, there are required,—five strong handspikes; a dame or rammer, of the caliber of the conic chamber, to ram the wad and the earth; a wooden knife a foot long, to place the earth round the bomb; an iron scraper two feet long, one end whereof must be four inches broad, and roundwise, to clean the bore and the chamber of the mortar, and the other end made in form of a spoon to clean the little chamber; a kind of brancard to carry the bomb, a shovel, and pick-axe.\n\nThe officer who is to mind the service of the mortar must have a quadrant to give the degrees of elevation.\n\nFive bombardiers, or others, are employed in that service; the first must take care to fetch the powder to charge the chamber of the mortar, putting his priming-iron in the touch-hole before he charges the chamber; and never going to fetch the powder before he has asked his officer at what quantity of powder he designs to charge, because more or less powder is wanted according to the distance where it is fired; the same will take care to ram the wad and earth, which another soldier puts in the chamber.\n\nThe soldier on the right will put again two shovelful of earth in the bottom of the bore, which should be likewise very well rammed down.\n\nThis done, the rammer or dame is returned into its place against the epaulement on the right of the mortar: he takes an handspike in the same place to post himself behind the carriage of the mortar, in order to help to push it into battery: having laid down his handspike, he takes out his priming-iron, and primes the touch-hole with fine powder.\n\nThe second soldier on the right and left will have by that time brought the bomb ready loaded, which must be received into the mortar by the first soldier, and placed very straight in the bore or chafe of the mortar.\n\nThe first on the right will furnish him with earth to put round the bomb, which he must take care to ram close with the knife given him by the second on the left.\n\nThis done, each shall take a handspike, which the two first on the right and left shall put under the pegs of retreat of the fore part, and the two behind under those of the hind part, and they together push the mortar in battery.\n\nAfterwards the officer points or directs the mortar.\n\nDuring that time the first soldier takes care to prime the touch-hole of the mortar, without ramming the powder; and the last on the right must have the match ready to let fire to the fuse of the bomb on the right, while the first is ready with his on the left to let fire to the touch-hole of the mortar, which he ought not to do till he sees the fuse well lighted.\n\nThe foremost soldiers will have their handspikes ready to raise the mortar upright as soon as it has discharged, while the hindmost on the left shall with the scraper clean the bore and chamber of the mortar.\n\nThe magazine of powder for the service of the battery must be situated 15 or 20 paces behind, and covered with boards and earth over it.—The loaded bombs are on the side of the said magazine, at five or six paces distance.\n\nThe officer who commands the service of the mortar must take care to discover as much as possible with the eye the distance of the place where he intends to throw his bomb, giving the mortar the degree of elevation according to the judgment he has formed of the distance. Having thrown the first bomb, he must diminish or increase the degrees of elevation according to the place upon which it shall fall. Several make use of tables to discover the different distances according to the differences of the elevations of the mortar, especially the degrees of the quadrant from 1 to 45°; but these, from the principles already laid down, must be fallacious.\n\nThe petard is the next piece of artillery which deserves our attention; and is a kind of engine of metal, tard, somewhat in shape of a high-crowned hat, serving to break down gates, barricades, draw-bridges, or the like works, which are intended to be surprised. It is very short, narrow at the breech and wide at the muzzle, made of copper mixed with a little brass, or of lead with tin.\n\nThe petards are not always of the same height and bigness: they are commonly 10 inches high, 7 inches of diameter a-top, and 10 inches at bottom. They weigh commonly 40, 45, and 50 pounds.\n\nThe madrier, on which the petard is placed, and where it is tied with iron circles, is of two feet for its greatest width, and of 18 inches on the sides, and no thicker than a common madrier. Under the madrier are two iron bars called croswife, with a hook, which serves to fix the petard.\n\nTo charge a petard 15 inches high, and 6 or 7 inches of caliber or diameter at the bore, the inside must be first very well cleaned and heated, so that the hand may bear the heat; then take the best powder that may be found, throw over it some spirit of wine, and\nGUNPOWDER, a composition of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, mixed together, and usually granulated; which easily takes fire, and, when fired, rarefies or expands with great vehemence, by means of its elastic force.\n\nIt is to this powder we owe all the action and effect of guns, ordnance, &c. so that the modern military art, fortification, &c. in a great measure depend thereon.\n\nInvention of Gunpowder. See Gun.\n\nMethod of making Gunpowder. Dr Shaw's receipt for this purpose is as follows: Take four ounces of refined nitre, an ounce of sulphur, and fix drams of small-coal: reduce these to a fine powder, and continue beating them for some time in a stone mortar with a wooden pestle, wetting the mixture between whiles with water, so as to form the whole into an uniform paste, which is reduced to grains, by passing it through a wire-sieve fit for the purpose; and in this form being carefully dried, it becomes the common gunpowder.\n\nFor greater quantities mills are usually provided, by means of which more work may be performed in one day than a man can do in a hundred.\n\nThe nitre or saltpetre is refined thus: Dissolve four pounds of rough nitre as it comes to us from the Indies, by boiling it in as much water as will commodiously suffice for that purpose; then let it stand for two or three days in a covered vessel of earth, with sticks laid across for the crystals to adhere to. The crystals being taken out, are drained and dried in the open air.\n\nIn order to reduce this salt to powder, they dissolve a large quantity of it in as small a proportion of water as possible; then keep it constantly stirring over the fire till the water exhales, and a white dry powder is left behind.\n\nIn order to purify the sulphur employed, they dissolve it with a very gentle heat; then scum and pass it through a double strainer. If the sulphur should happen to take fire in the melting, they have an iron cover that fits on close to the melting-vessel, and damps the flame. The sulphur is judged to be sufficiently refined if it melts, without yielding any fetid odour, between two hot iron plates, into a kind of red substance.\n\nThe coal for the making of gunpowder is either that of willow or hazel, well charred in the usual manner, and reduced to powder. And thus the ingredients are prepared for making this commodity: but as these ingredients require to be intimately mixed, and as there would be danger of their firing if beat in a dry form, the method is to keep them continually moist, either with water, urine, or a solution of sal ammoniac: they continue thus stamping them together for 24 hours; after which the mass is fit for corning and drying.\nGUN\n\nGunpowder drying in the sun, or otherwise, so as sedulously to prevent its firing.\n\nDifferent kinds of Gunpowder. The three ingredients of gunpowder are mixed in various proportions according as the powder is intended for muskets, great guns, or mortars, though these proportions seem not to be perfectly adjusted or settled by competent experience.\n\nSemenowicz, for mortars, directs a hundred pounds of saltpetre, twenty-five of sulphur, and as many of charcoal; for great guns, a hundred pounds of saltpetre, fifteen pounds of sulphur, and eighteen pounds of charcoal; for muskets and pistols, a hundred pounds of saltpetre, eight pounds of sulphur, and ten pounds of charcoal. Miethius extols the proportion of one pound of saltpetre to three ounces of charcoal, and two or two and a quarter of sulphur; than which, he affirms, no gunpowder can possibly be stronger. He adds, that the usual practice of making the gunpowder weaker for mortars than guns, is without any foundation, and renders the expense needlessly much greater: for whereas to load a large mortar twenty-four pounds of common powder is required, and consequently, to load it ten times, two hundred and forty pounds, he shows, by calculation, that the same effect would be produced by one hundred and fifty pounds of the strong powder.\n\nOn this subject Count Rumford * observes, that almost all those who have written upon gunpowder, particularly those of the last century, have given different receipts for its composition; and he proposes it as a query, Whether these differences have not arisen from observing that some kinds of powder were better adapted to particular purposes than others, or from experiments made on purpose to ascertain the fact? \"There is one circumstance (he says) that would lead us to suppose that this was the case. That kind of powder designed for mortars and great guns was weaker than that intended for small arms: for if there is any foundation for these conjectures, it is certain, that the weakest powder, or the heaviest in proportion to its elastic force, ought to be used to impel the heaviest bullets; and particularly in guns that are imperfectly formed, where the vent is large, and the windage very great. I am perfectly aware (adds he), that an objection may here be made, viz. that the elastic fluid generated from gunpowder must be supposed to have the same properties very nearly, whatever may be the proportion of its several ingredients; and that therefore the only difference there can be in powder is, that one kind may generate more of this fluid, and another less; and that when it is generated it acts in the same manner, and will alike escape, and with the same velocity, by any passage it can find. But to this I answer, that though the fluid may be the same, as it undoubtedly is, and though its density and elasticity may be the same in all cases at the instant of its generation; yet in the explosion, the elastic and unelastic parts are so mixed together, that I imagine the fluid cannot expand without taking the gross matter along with it; and the velocity with which the flame issues at the vent is to be computed from the elasticity of the fluid, and the density or weight of the fluid and gross matter taken together, and not simply from the density and elasticity of the fluid.\"\n\nTo increase the strength of powder, Dr Shaw thinks it proper to make the grains considerably large, and to have it well sifted from the small dust. We see that gunpowder, reduced to dust, has little explosive force; but when the grains are large, the flame of one grain has a ready passage to another, so that the whole parcel may thus take fire nearly at the same time, otherwise much force may be lost, or many of the grains go away as they unfired.\n\nIn the 71st volume of the Phil. Trans. Count Rumford gives an account of several attempts to augment the force of gunpowder by the addition of different ingredients. The power of steam has by many been overrated to such a degree, as to be supposed capable of answering the purposes of gunpowder; but no attempts to accomplish this have ever succeeded in any degree. Count Rumford attempted to combine the forces of steam and gunpowder together in the following manner. Having procured a number of air bladders of very small fishes, he put different quantities of water into them, from the size of a small pea to that of a pistol bullet, and tying them up with some very fine thread, hung them up to dry on the outside. He then provided a number of cartridges made of fine paper, and filled them with a quantity of gunpowder equal to the usual charge for a common horseman's pistol. He then loaded the pistol with a bullet, fired it against an oaken plank about six feet from the muzzle, and observed the recoil and penetration of the bullet. He next tried the effect of one of these small bladders of water when put among the gunpowder, but always found the force of the powder very much diminished, and the larger the quantity of water the greater was the diminution; the report of the explosion was also diminished in a still greater proportion than the force of the bullet or recoil. It being supposed that the bladder had burst, and thus by wetting the gunpowder prevented it from taking fire, the experiment was repeated with highly rectified spirit of wine, but the diminution of the force was very little inferior to what it had been with water. Ethereal oil of turpentine and small quantities of quicksilver were also tried, but with no better success than before. Thinking, however, that the failure of the quicksilver might be owing to its having been too much in a body, the experiment was repeated with the metal dispersed in small particles through the powder. To accomplish this dispersion the more completely, 20 grains of ethiops mineral were mixed very intimately with 145 grains of powder; but still the force of the bullet was much less than if the powder had been used without any addition. As the explosion of pulvis fulminans appears vastly superior to that of gunpowder, some salt of tartar, in its purest state, was mixed in the proportion of 20 grains to 145 of powder; but on firing the piece, it was still found that the force of the explosion was lessened. Sal ammoniac was next tried, which, under certain circumstances, is found to produce a great quantity of air or elastic vapour; but on mixing 20 grains of it with 145 of gunpowder, the force of the explosion was still found to be diminished. As most of the metals, when dissolved in acids, particularly balsam spirit of nitre, are found to produce much elastic vapour, it was thought worth while to try whether the force of powder could be augmented by this means. Twenty grains\ngrains of brafs dust were therefore mixed with 145 grains of powder; but still the force of the explosion was not augmented. In our author's opinion, however, neither brafs dust nor ethiops mineral diminish the force of the explosion otherwise than by filling up the interstices between the grains, obstructing the passage of the flame, and thus impeding the progress of the inflammation. Thus it appears, that little hope remains of augmenting the force of gunpowder by any addition either of liquid or inflammable fluids: the reason is obvious; viz. because all of them, the liquids especially, absorb great quantities of heat before they can be converted into vapour; and this vapour, after it is formed, requires more heat to make it expand more forcibly than air: hence, as the effects of gunpowder depend entirely upon the emission of a quantity of air, and its rarefaction by vehement heat, the power must be greatly diminished by the absorption of this heat, which ought to be spent in rarefying the air. Even solid bodies cannot be set on fire without a previous absorption of heat to convert them into vapour; but liquids have this property still more than solids, and must therefore diminish the explosive force still more. Lime added to gunpowder, however, is said to augment the power of the explosion by one-third.\n\nIn his experiments on gunpowder, Count Rumford had the curiosity to compare the strength of aurum fulminans, when inclosed in a gun-barrel, with that of common gunpowder; but his experiment only verified what has been found by others, viz. that this powder which in the open air makes such a very violent report, has in close vessels scarce any power, comparatively speaking, either of explosion or projecting a bullet. Count Rumford, however, taking it for granted that the power of aurum fulminans would be found much greater than that of gunpowder, took care to have a barrel of uncommon strength prepared for the experiment. The weight of it was 7 lb. 5 oz.; the length 13.25 inches, and the width of the bore 0.55 inches. This barrel, being charged with 27.44 grains of aurum fulminans and two leaden bullets, which, together with the leather put about them to make them fit the bore without windage, weighed 427 grains: it was laid upon a chafing dish of live coals at the distance of about ten feet from the pendulum, and the piece was directed against the centre of the pendulum. Some minutes elapsed before the powder exploded; but when it did so, the explosion did not much exceed the report of a well-charged air-gun; and it was not until he saw the pendulum in motion, that Count Rumford could be persuaded that the bullets had been discharged. On examination, however, it was found that nothing had been left in the barrel, and that the powder had probably been all exploded, as a great many particles of the revived metal were thrown about. From a calculation of the motion communicated to the pendulum, it was found that the velocity of the bullets had been about 428 feet in a second; whence it appears that the power of aurum fulminans, compared with that of gunpowder, is only as 4 to 13 very nearly.\n\nMethod of Trying and Examining Gunpowder. There are two general methods of examining gunpowder; one with regard to its purity, the other with regard to its strength. Its purity is known by laying two or three little heaps near each other upon white paper, and firing one of them. For if this takes fire readily, and the smoke rises upright, without leaving any dross or feculent matter behind, and without burning the paper, or firing the other heaps, it is deemed a sign that the sulphur and nitre were well purified, that the coal was good, and that the three ingredients were thoroughly incorporated together: but if the other heaps also take fire at the same time, it is presumed, that either common salt was mixed with the nitre, or that the coal was not well ground, or the whole mass not well beat and mixed together; and if either the nitre or sulphur be not well purified, the paper will be black or spotted.\n\nSeveral instruments have been invented to try the strength of gunpowder; but they have generally been complained of as inaccurate. Mr Thomson, (now Count Rumford), in the 7th volume of the Philosophical Transactions, gives an account of an exact method of proving the strength of it. \"As the force of powder (says he) arises from the action of an elastic fluid that is generated from it in its inflammation, the quicker the charge takes fire, the more of this fluid will be generated in any given short space of time, and the greater of course will its effect be upon the bullet.\" But in the common method of proving gunpowder, the weight by which the powder is confined is so great in proportion to the quantity of the charge, that there is time quite sufficient for the charge to be all inflamed, even when the powder is of the lowest composition, before the body to be put in motion can be sensibly removed from its place. The experiment therefore may show which of the two kinds of powder is the strongest, when equal quantities of both are confined in equal spaces, and both completely inflamed; but the degree of the inflammability, which is a property essential to the goodness of the powder, cannot by these means be ascertained. Hence it appears how powder may answer to the proof, such as is commonly required, and may nevertheless turn out very indifferent when it comes to be used in service. But though the common powder-triers may show powder to be better than it really is; they can never make it appear to be worse than it is; it will therefore always be the interest of those who manufacture the commodity to adhere to the old method of proof, but the purchaser will find his account in having it examined in a method by which its goodness may be ascertained with greater precision.\n\nFrom several experiments it appears, that the effect of the charge is considerably augmented or diminished, according to the greater or less force employed in ramming it down. To prevent this inconvenience, Count Rumford advises the use of a cylindric ramrod of wood, fitted with a metal ring about an inch or an inch and a half in diameter; which being placed at a proper distance from the end which goes up into the bore, will prevent the powder from being too much compressed. In making experiments of this kind, however, it is necessary to pay attention to the heat of the barrel as well as to the temperature of the atmosphere; for heat and cold, dryness and moisture, have a very sensible effect upon gunpowder to augment or diminish its force. When a very great degree of accuracy therefore\ntherefore happens to be requisite, it will be proper to begin by firing the piece two or three times, merely to warm it; after which three or four experiments may be made with standard powder, to determine the proof mark a second time, for the strength of powder is different at different times, in consequence of the state of the atmosphere. After this the experiments may be made with the powder that is to be proved, taking care to preserve the same interval of time between the discharges, that the heat of the piece may be the same in each trial.\n\nHaving determined the comparative degrees of strength of two different kinds of powder, their comparative value may be ascertained by augmenting the quantity of the weaker powder till the velocity of the bullets in both cases becomes the same. The strong powder is therefore precisely as much more valuable than the weak, as it produces the same effect with a smaller quantity. Thus if a quarter of an ounce of one kind of powder discharges a bullet with the same velocity that half an ounce of another kind does, it is plain that the former is twice as valuable as the latter, and ought to be sold at double the price.—By comparison of this kind, Count Rumford found that the best battle powder (so called from its being made at the village of Battle in Kent) is stronger than government powder, in the proportion of 4 to 3; but from a comparison of the prices, it appears that the former is no less than 41\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent dearer than it ought to be; and consequently, that whoever uses it in preference to government powder, does it at a certain loss of 41\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent of the money it costs him.\n\nIt is supposed by Count Rumford, that very little of the heat acquired in firing a piece of ordnance comes from the powder; for the time that it continues in the piece, perhaps not exceeding the 200th part of a second, is so small, that were the flame four hundred times, instead of four times, as Mr Robins supposes, hotter than red hot iron, it is by far too short to communicate a sensible degree of heat to one of our large pieces of cannon. Besides, if the heat of the flame was sufficient to communicate such a degree of heat to the gun, it must undoubtedly be capable of burning up all combustible bodies that come in its way, and of melting lead-shot when such were used; but instead of this, we frequently see the finest paper discharged from the mouth of a gun without being inflamed, after it has sustained the action of the fire through the whole length of the bore; and the smallest lead-shot is discharged without being melted. The objection drawn from the heat of bullets taken up immediately after being discharged from firearms does not hold; for bullets discharged from air-guns and even cross-bows are likewise found hot, especially when they happen to strike any hard body, and are much flattened. If a musket ball be discharged into water, or against any very soft body, it will not be sensibly heated; but if it hits a plate of iron or any other body which it cannot penetrate, it will be broken in pieces by the blow, and the dispersed parts will be found in a state little short of actual fusion. Hence our author concludes, that bullets are not heated by the flame, but by percussion. Another objection is, that the vents of brass guns are frequently enlarged, to such a degree by repeatedly firing them, that the piece becomes useless.\n\nBut this proves only that brass is easily corroded by the flame of gunpowder; which indeed is the case with iron also. We cannot suppose that in either case any real solution takes place; on the contrary, it is very evident that it does not: for when the vents of firearms are lined with gold, they will remain without enlargement for any length of time, though it is well known that gold is much more easily melted than iron. As the heat communicated to bullets, therefore, is not to be ascribed to the flame but to percussion, so the heat acquired by guns is to be attributed, in our author's opinion, to the motion and friction of the internal parts of the metal among themselves by the violent action of the flame upon the inside of the bore. To generate heat, the action of the powder must be not only sufficient to strain the metal, and produce a motion in its parts, but this effect must be extremely rapid; and the effect will be much augmented if the exertion of the force and the duration of its action are momentaneous: for in that case the fibres of the metal that are violently stretched will return with their full force and velocity, and the swift vibratory motion and attrition above-mentioned will be produced. Now the effort of any given charge of powder upon the gun is very nearly the same whether it be fired with a bullet or without; but the velocity with which the generated elastic fluid makes its escape, is much greater when the powder is fired alone than when it is made to impel one or more bullets; the heat ought therefore to be much greater in the former than in the latter case, as has been found by experiment. \"But to make this matter still plainer, (says our author), we will suppose any given quantity of powder to be confined in a space that is just capable of containing it, and that in this situation it is set on fire. Let us suppose this space to be the chamber of a piece of ordnance, and that a bullet or any other solid body is so firmly fixed in the bore, immediately upon the charge, that the whole effort of the powder shall not be able to remove it: as the powder goes on to be inflamed, and the elastic fluid to be generated, the pressure upon the inside of the chamber will be increased, till at length all the powder being burnt, the strain upon the metal will be at its greatest height, and in this situation things will remain; the cohesion or elasticity of the particles of metal counterbalancing the pressure of the fluid.—Under these circumstances very little heat would be generated; for the continued effort of the elastic fluid would approach to the nature of the pressure of a weight; and that concussion, vibration, and friction among the particles of the metal, which in the collision of elastic bodies is the cause of the heat produced, would scarcely take effect. But instead of being firmly fixed in its place, let the bullet now be moveable, but let it give way with great difficulty, and by slow degrees. In this case the elastic fluid will be generated as before, and will exert its whole force upon the chamber of the piece; but as the bullet gives way to the pressure, and moves on in the bore, the fluid will expand itself and grow weaker, and the particles of the metal will gradually return to their former situations; but the velocity with which the metal restores itself being but small, the vibration that remains in the metal after the elastic fluid has made its escape will be very languid, as will the heat be which\nGunpowder is generated by it. But if, instead of giving way with too much difficulty, the bullet is made lighter, so as to afford but little resistance to the elastic fluid in making its escape, or if it is fired without any bullet at all; then, there being little or nothing to oppose the passage of the flame through the bore, it will expand itself with amazing velocity, and its action upon the gun will cease almost in an instant; the strained metal will restore itself with a very rapid motion, and a sharp vibration will ensue, by which the piece will be much heated.\n\nThe Count, however, after more mature reflection, a greater number and diversity of experiments, and the increased knowledge which must always accompany such intellectual exertions as have distinguished him through life, has been enabled to evince, that the amazing force of the elastic fluid generated in the combustion of gunpowder, may be fully accounted for on the hypothesis, that it entirely depends on the elasticity of watery vapour, or steam, which is doubled by every increase of temperature equal to 3°2 of Fahrenheit's thermometer. If then the mean pressure of the atmosphere at the temperature of 21°2 equals the elastic force of steam, this force at the temperature of 24°2 must be equal to the pressure of two atmospheres, since \\(21 + 30 = 24\\), and so on in the same ratio. The Count also found that the elastic force of gunpowder is equal to the pressure of 131,072 atmospheres at the temperature of 72°2. By the flame of gunpowder, brass has been known to be melted, which requires a temperature equal to 380°2 of Fahrenheit, or 21°2 of Wedgwood, to bring it to a state of fusion. He also proved in a satisfactory manner, that gunpowder contains a sufficient quantity of water for supplying the requisite proportion of steam; but for a full account of his very ingenious and detailed experiments on this curious subject, we must refer our readers to Nicholson's Journal, vol. i. 410. p. 459.\n\nIt has been proposed to substitute hyperoxymuriate of potash in place of nitre; but the use of this substance is attended with many inconveniences, some of which preclude its being employed in the composition of gunpowder. See Chemistry, No. 959 to No. 967.\n\nTo recover damaged Gunpowder. The method of the powder-mechants is, to put part of the powder on a sail-cloth, to which they add an equal weight of what is really good; and with a shovel mingle it well together, dry it in the sun, and barrel it up, keeping it in a dry and proper place. Others again, if it be very bad, restore it by moistening it with vinegar, water, urine, or brandy; then they beat it fine, Pearce it, and to every pound of powder add an ounce, an ounce and an half, or two ounces, according as it is decayed, of melted saltpetre. Afterwards, these ingredients are to be moistened and mixed well, so that nothing can be discerned in the composition, which may be known by cutting the mass; and then they granulate it as before. In case the powder be in a manner quite spoiled, the only way is to extract the saltpetre with water according to the usual manner, by boiling, filtrating, evaporating, and crystallizing; and then with fresh sulphur and charcoal to make it up anew again.\n\nIn regard to the medical virtues of gunpowder, Boerhaave informs us, that the flame of it affords a very healthy fume in the height of the plague, because the explosive acid vapour of nitre and sulphur corrects the air; and that the same vapour, if received in a small close pent-up place, kills insects.\n\nIt is enacted by 5 and 11 of Geo. I. and 5 Geo. II. c. 20. that gunpowder be carried to any place in a covered carriage; the barrels being close-jointed; or in cases and bags of leather, &c. And persons keeping more than 200 pounds weight of gunpowder at one time, within the cities of London and Westminster, or the suburbs, &c., are liable to forfeitures if it be not removed; and justices of the peace may issue warrants to search for, seize, and remove the same.\n\nGun-Shot Wounds. See Surgery.\n\nGun-Smith, a maker of small fire-arms, as muskets, fowling-pieces, pistols, &c.\n\nGun-Smithery, the business of a gun-smith, or the art of making fire-arms of the smaller sort, as muskets, fowling-pieces, pistols, &c.\n\nThe principal part of these instruments is the barrel, which ought to have the following properties. 1. Lightness, that it may incommode the person who carries it as little as possible. 2. Sufficient strength and other properties requisite to prevent its bursting by a discharge. 3. It ought to be constructed in such a manner as not to recoil with violence. And, 4. It ought to be of sufficient length to carry the shot to as great a distance as the force of the powder employed is capable of doing.\n\nThe manufacture of fire-arms is now carried to such a degree of perfection by different European nations, that it may perhaps be justly doubted whether any farther improvement in the requisites just mentioned can be made. For the materials, the softest iron that can be procured is to be made use of. The best in this country are formed of stubs, as they are called, or old horse-shoe nails; which are procured by the gunsmiths from farriers, and from poor people who submit by picking them up on the great roads leading to London. These are sold at about 10s. per cwt., and 28 pounds are requisite to form a single musket barrel. The method of manufacturing them from this material is as follows: A hoop of about an inch broad, and six or seven inches diameter, is placed in a perpendicular situation, and the stubs, previously well cleaned, piled up in it with their heads outermost on each side, till the hoop is quite filled and wedged tight with them. The whole then resembles a rough circular cake of iron, which being heated to a white heat, and then strongly hammered, coalesces into one solid lump. The hoop is now removed, and the heatings and hammerings repeated till the iron is rendered very tough and close in the grain; when it is drawn out into pieces of about 24 inches in length, half an inch or more in breadth, and half an inch in thickness.\n\nFour of these pieces are employed for one barrel; but in the ordinary way a single bar of the best soft iron is employed. The workmen begin by hammering out this into the form of a flat ruler, having its length and breadth, proportioned to the dimensions of the intended barrel. By repeated heating and hammering this plate is turned round a tempered iron rod called a mandril, the diameter of which is considerably smaller than the intended bore of the barrel. One of the edges of the plate being laid over the other about half\nhalf an inch, the whole is heated and welded by two or three inches at a time, hammering it briskly, but with moderate strokes, upon an anvil which has a number of semicircular furrows in it, adapted to barrels of different sizes. Every time the barrel is withdrawn from the fire, the workman strikes it gently against the anvil once or twice in an horizontal direction. By this operation the particles of the metal are more perfectly consolidated, and every appearance of a seam in the barrel is obliterated. The mandril being then again introduced into the cavity of the barrel, the latter is very strongly hammered upon it in one of the semicircular hollows of the anvil, by small portions at a time; the heatings and hammerings being repeated until the whole barrel has undergone the operation, and its parts rendered as perfectly continuous as if they had been formed out of a solid piece. To effect this completely, three welding heats are necessary when the very best iron is made use of, and a greater number for the coarser kinds. The French workmen imagine, that by giving the barrel, while in the fire, slight horizontal strokes with the hammer, so as to communicate a vibratory motion to the iron, those particles are thrown off which are in a state of fusion and cannot easily be converted into malleable iron: but considering the great number of operations already described which the metal has undergone, we can scarce suppose this to be of much consequence.\n\nThe next operation in forming the barrels is the boring of them, which is done in the following manner: Two beams of oak, each about six inches in diameter, and fix or seven feet long, are placed horizontally and parallel to one another; having each of their extremities mortised upon a strong upright piece about three feet high, and firmly fixed. A space of three or four inches is left between the horizontal pieces, in which a piece of wood is made to slide by having at either end a tenon let into a groove which runs on the inside of each beam throughout its whole length. Through this sliding piece a strong pin or bolt of iron is driven or screwed in a perpendicular direction, having at its upper end a round hole large enough to admit the breech of the barrel, which is secured in it by means of a piece of iron that serves as a wedge, and a vertical screw passing through the upper part of the hole. A chain is fastened to a staple in one side of the sliding piece which runs between the two horizontal beams; and passing over a pulley at one end of the machine, has a weight hooked on to it. An upright piece of timber is fixed above this pulley and between the ends of the beams, having its upper end perforated by the axis of an iron crank furnished with a square socket; the other axis being supported by the wall, or by a strong post, and loaded with a heavy wheel of cast iron to give it force. The axes of this crank are in a line with the hole in the bolt already mentioned.—The borer being then fixed into the socket of the crank, has its other end, previously well oiled, introduced into the barrel, whose breech part is made fast in the hole of the bolt: the chain is then carried over the pulley, and the weight hooked on; the crank being then turned with the hand, the barrel advances as the borer cuts its way, till it has passed through the whole length.—The boring bit consists of an iron rod somewhat longer than the barrel, one end of which fits the socket of the crank; the other is adapted to a cylindrical piece of tempered steel about an inch and a half in length, having its surface cut after the manner of a perpetual screw, with five or six threads, the obliquity of which is very small. The breadth of the furrows is the same with that of the threads, and their depth sufficient to let the metal cut by the threads pass through them easily. Thus the bit gets a very strong hold of the metal; and the threads, being sharp at the edges, scoop out and remove all the inequalities and roughnesses from the inside of the barrel, and render the cavity smooth and equal throughout. A number of bits, each a little larger than the former, are afterwards successively passed through the barrel in the same way, until the bore has acquired the magnitude intended. By this operation the barrel is very much heated especially the first time the borer is passed through it, by which means it is apt to warp. To prevent this in some measure, the barrel is covered with a cloth kept constantly wetted, which not only preserves the barrel from an excess of heat, but likewise preserves the temper of the bit from being destroyed. The borer itself must also be withdrawn from time to time; both to clean it from the shavings of the metal and to oil it, or repair any damages it may have sustained. Every time a fresh bit has been passed through the barrel, the latter must be carefully examined, to see if it has warped; and likewise if there are any spots, by the workmen called blacks, on its inside. When warped, it must be straightened on the anvil; for which a few light strokes on the convex parts will be sufficient; and this is termed setting up the barrel. When black spots are perceived, the corresponding part on the outside must be marked, and driven in by gentle strokes with the hammer, when they will be completely removed by passing the borer another time through the piece.\n\nThe equality of the bore is of the utmost consequence to the perfection of a barrel; inasmuch that the greatest possible accuracy in every other respect will not make amends for any deficiency in this. The method used by gunsmiths to ascertain this is by a cylindrical plug of tempered steel highly polished, about an inch in length, and fitting the bore exactly. This is screwed upon the end of an iron rod, and introduced into the cavity of the barrel, where it is moved backwards and forwards; and the places where it passes with difficulty being marked, the boring bit is repeatedly passed until it moves with equal ease through every part. Any person who wishes to know the merit of his piece in this respect, may do it with tolerable accuracy by means of a plug of lead cast on a rod of iron; or even by a musket ball filed exactly to the bore, and pushed through the barrel by a ramrod; taking care, however, not to use much force lest the ball be flattened, and its passage thus rendered difficult.\n\nThe last step towards the perfection of the inside of the barrel is termed fine boring; by which is meant the smoothing it in such a manner as to remove all marks and inequalities left by the borer. The fine borer resembles the other in its general construction; but instead of the piece of steel cut in form of a screw which belongs to that, it is furnished with a square broach 10 or 12 inches long, highly polished, and very sharp, by which means it cuts the metal very smoothly. It is found to answer the purpose best when only two of its\nits edges are allowed to work; the other two are covered with slips of oiled paper, one or more additional slips being put on each time that the instrument is passed through the barrel. The fine-borer is frequently passed through, from the muzzle to the breech, and from the breech to the muzzle, until the whole inside presents a perfectly equal and polished surface; the barrel being likewise examined and set up, if requisite, after each time. It is absolutely necessary that this instrument should be perfectly true, and not in the least cast or warped in the tempering.\n\nBesides the operations above described, another, called polishing, is usually performed on gun-barrels, though it is doubtful whether this last be attended with any good effect or not. It is performed by a cylinder of lead, five or six inches long, cast upon a rod of iron, and filed exactly to the bore. The lead being then covered with very fine emery and oil, is wrought backwards and forwards through the whole length of the barrel until the inside has acquired the requisite degree of polish. The disadvantages of this operation are, that it is scarce possible to perform it without pressing more upon one part than another, and thus producing some degree of inequality on the inside, which is of the very worst consequence to firearms. The polish thus given is likewise very perishable; so that the fine-boring may justly be considered as the last operation necessary for the inside of a barrel; and it is then proper to give the external form and proportions by means of a file.\n\nFor this purpose, four faces are first formed upon it, then eight, then 16; and so on till it be quite round, excepting the part next the breech, called the reinforced part, which is always left of an octagonal form. It being absolutely necessary that the barrel should be equally thick on every side, gunsmiths employ, for accomplishing this purpose, a particular tool named a compass. This consists of an iron rod bent in such a manner as to form two parallel branches about an inch distant from each other. One of these branches is introduced into the barrel, and kept closely applied to the side, by means of one or more springs with which it is furnished; the other descends parallel to this on the outside, and has several screws passing through it with their points directed to the barrel. By screwing these until their points touch the surface of the barrel, and then turning the instrument round within the bore, we perceive where the metal is too thick, and how much it must be reduced, in order to render every part perfectly equal throughout its circumference. It may be made long enough to reach the whole length of the barrel, though it will be more convenient to have it only half as much, and to introduce it first at one end and then at the other. Instead of rounding the barrel by means of a file and compass, however, some people do so by turning it in a lathe; which is no doubt more expeditious, though neither so certain nor exact. A spindle as long as a gun-barrel cannot, without great difficulty, be prevented from springing considerably under the tool employed to reduce or smooth it in turning; whence it is found, that by this operation barrels are more frequently warped than by all the borings they undergo; and there is now this farther inconvenience, that they cannot be set up as formerly, without danger of destroying them entirely.\n\nThe barrels being thus bored and formed externally, it is customary with the gunsmiths in France to folder on the loops and aim before they breach the barrel. The English, however, do not restrict themselves in this manner: for as soft folder is sufficient for fastening on these, they never use any other; while the French, who use hard folder, most of consequence employ a great heat. Thus the inside is roughened sometimes considerably, that it is necessary to repeat the fine boring; which could not be done without injuring the threads of the screw formed for the breech, if the barrel were prepared for the latter without foldering on the former.\n\nThe first tool employed in forming the breech-screw is a plug of tempered steel, somewhat conical, with the threads of a male screw upon its surface, and by the workman termed a screw tap. This being introduced into the barrel, and worked from left to right and back again, until it has marked out the four first threads of the screw, another less conical tap is introduced; and when this has carried the impression of the screw as far as it is intended to go, a third one, nearly cylindrical, is made use of, scarcely differing from the plug of the breech intended to fill the screw thus formed in the barrel. The plug itself has its screw formed by means of a screw-plate of tempered steel, with several female screws, corresponding with the taps employed for forming that in the barrel. Seven or eight threads are a sufficient length for a plug: they ought to be neat and sharp, so as completely to fill the turns made in the barrel by the tap. The breech plug is then to be case-hardened, or to have its surface converted into steel, by covering it with flayings of horn, or the parings of the hoofs of horses, and keeping it for some time red hot; after which it is plunged in cold water.\n\nThe only thing now requisite for completing the barrels is to give them a proper colour; as a preparation for which their outside is first to be neatly polished with oil and emery. This being done, it was formerly the custom to give such a degree of heat as would make them blue throughout; but as this cannot be effected without a partial calcination of the surface, which of consequence affects the inside also, the blue colour has been for some time disfused, and a brown one substituted in its place. To give this colour, the pieces are first rubbed over with aquafortis or spirit of salt diluted with water; after which they are laid by till a complete coat of rust is formed upon them: a little oil is then applied; and the surface being rubbed dry, is polished by means of a hard brush and bees-wax.\n\nThus the common musket barrels for the purposes especially of sportsmanship are made; but there are some other methods of manufacture, by which the barrels are made to differ in some respects from those just described, and are thought to be considerably improved. One kind of these are called twisted barrels; and by the English workmen are formed out of the plates made of flutes formerly described. Four of these, of the size already mentioned, are requisite to make one barrel. One of them heated red hot for five or six inches is turned like a cork-screw by means of the hammer and anvil; the remaining parts being treated successively in the same manner until the whole is turned into a spiral, forming a tube, the diameter of which corresponds with the bore of the intended barrel. Four are generally sufficient to form a barrel of the ordinary length, i.e.\nfrom 32 to 38 inches; and the two which form the breech or strongest part, called the reinforced part, are considerably thicker than those which form the muzzle or fore part of the barrel. One of these tubes is then welded to a part of an old barrel to serve as a handle; after which the turns of the spiral are united by heating the tube two or three inches at a time to a bright white heat, and striking the end of it several times against the anvil in a horizontal direction with considerable strength, which is called jumping the barrel; and the heats given for this purpose are called jumping heats. The next step is to introduce a mandril into the cavity, and to hammer the heated portion lightly in order to flatten the ridges or burs raised by the jumping at the place where the spirals are joined. As soon as one piece is jumped throughout its whole length, another is welded to it, and treated in the same manner, until the four pieces are united, when the part of the old barrel is cut off, as being no longer of any use. The welding is repeated three times at least, and is performed exactly in the same manner as directed for plain barrels; and the piece may afterwards be finished according to the directions already given.\n\nThe operation for the French twisted barrels is very different from that just mentioned, and much more exceptional. It consists in heating the barrel by a few inches at a time to a strong red heat; one end is then screwed into a vice, and a square piece of iron with a handle like an auger is introduced into the other. By means of these the fibres of the heated portion are twisted into a spiral direction, which is supposed to resist the effort of the inflamed powder better than the other. To render this operation complete, however, it must be observed, that when once the several portions of the barrel have been twisted, the subsequent heats ought not to be very great, or the grain of the metal will regain its former state, and the barrel be no better for the twisting than before. To twist a barrel in this manner, also, it will be necessary to forge it at least half a foot longer than it is intended to be, so that a sufficient length may be kept cold at each end to give a sufficient purchase to the vice and twisting instrument; and these portions must afterwards be cut off before the barrel is bored, or two pieces of an old barrel may be welded to the muzzle and breech of that which is to be twisted, and cut off when the operation is over. These pieces may also be made stronger than usual to resist the force of the vice and twisting instrument; and in order to give the latter a firmer hold, the cavity of the muzzle may be made of a square form. The English workmen are unanimously of opinion that this method of twisting is really injurious to the barrel, by straining the fibres of the metal. At any rate, from the injudicious methods followed by the French artists, the greatest part of their barrels, said to be twisted, are not so in reality; there being at least six or seven inches at the muzzle, and seven or eight at the breech, which are not affected by the operation.\n\nThe French ribbon barrels have a great resemblance to the English twisted ones; but the process for making them is much more operose, though it seems not to possess any real advantage over that used by the English artists. A plate of iron, about the twelfth part of an inch in thickness, is turned round a mandril, and welded its whole length in the same manner as a plain barrel. Upon this slight barrel, which is called the lining, a plate of iron about an inch in breadth, and bevelled off at the edges, is by means of successive heats rolled in a spiral direction; after which it is termed the ribbon, and must have a thickness corresponding with that part of the barrel which it is to form. As it would, however, be difficult to form a ribbon of sufficient length for the whole barrel, it is made in several pieces; and when one piece is rolled on, another is welded to its end, and the operation continued until the lining be entirely covered. The edges are so much bevelled, that the one folds over the other about a quarter of an inch. After the ribbon is all rolled on, the barrel must be heated by two or three inches at a time, and the turns of the spiral united to each other and to the lining by being welded in the same manner as the twisted barrel; though, from what has been said of the construction of these barrels, it is plain that the operation of jumping cannot be admitted in them. The barrel is afterwards bored in such a manner that almost the whole of the lining is cut out, and scarce anything left but the ribbon with which the lining was covered.\n\nThe superiority of twisted and ribbon barrels over the plain kind gave occasion to a third sort named wired barrels. These were invented by an ingenious workman at Paris named Barrois; whose method was as follows: Upon a thin barrel, filed and dressed as usual, he rolled, as close as possible, and in a spiral direction, a tempered iron wire about the thickness of a crow-quill, the first layer covering only the reinforced part. The turns of the wire were soldered to each other and to the barrel with a composition which he kept a secret. The wired part was then filed smooth and bright, but not so much as to weaken it; a second layer of wire was applied over the first, extending two-thirds of the length of the barrel; and this being smoothed and brightened like the first, a third layer was applied, which covered the two former and reached quite to the muzzle.\n\nThe barrels made after this manner are supposed to be much superior to others, though the supposition seems not to be well founded. It is certain that wire is not preferable to other iron as a material for gun-barrels; and the folder used by M. Barrois in a quantity nearly equal to the wire itself, must be accounted a defect as far as it was used; for no metal has yet been found equal to iron for the purposes of gunsmiths: so that by the use of so much of this folder in the composition of the barrel, it must be undoubtedly weaker than if it had been all made of iron. We are not to suppose the wire absolutely free from flaws; and even though it were, there will always be small cavities between its turns, which the folder cannot fill completely. Besides, as the operation of wiring was performed by M. Barrois upon a barrel that had been previously bored and dressed within, the repeated heats to which it was afterwards subjected in soldering, if they did not cause it warp, at least rendered it so rough that it was necessary to fine-bore it afterwards. The only advantage therefore which these barrels were found to possess was their beautiful appearance; which was greatly overbalanced by the circumstances just mentioned, as well as by the extravagant prices at which they were sold; a single barrel being sold at £1. and a double one at twice that sum; whence the fate of them\nthem never answered the expectation of the inventor, or, and after his death nobody thought of making them.\n\nThe Spanish barrels have long been held in great estimation, both on account of their being formed of better iron than those of other countries, and likewise from an opinion of their being more perfectly forged and bored. Those made at Madrid are the best, and even of these such as have been made by former gunsmiths are in the greatest estimation. The most celebrated Spanish gunsmiths were Nicolas Biz, who lived in the beginning of the present century, and died in 1724; and the barrels fabricated by him in the former part of his life are held in greatest estimation. Those of his contemporaries, Juan Belan and Juan Fernandez, are no less valued; all of their barrels selling in France at 1000 livres, or £31.15s. sterling. The successors of these great artists were Diego Esquivel, Alonzo Martinez, Agustin Ortiz, Matthias Vaera, Luis Santos, Juan Santos, Francisco Garcia, Francisco Targarone, Joseph Cano, and N. Zelaya. The most celebrated after these were Francisco Loper, Salvador Cenarro, Miguel Zeguerra, Isidoro Soler, and Juan de Soto. The three first are gunsmiths to the king; and the barrels made by all of them sold for £31.15s. sterling. Almost all the Madrid barrels are composed of the old shoes of horses and mules, which are all collected for the purpose. They are manufactured first by welding longitudinally, and then being joined together in four or five pieces like the English barrels made from stubs, as already mentioned. In this, and indeed all other operations for making gun-barrels, an immense waste of the iron takes place; but that of the Spanish iron is by far the greatest, a mass of 40 or 45 pounds being required to make one barrel, which when rough from the forge weighs only six or seven pounds; so that from 30 to 38 pounds are lost in the hammerings. It may perhaps, however, be doubted, whether the iron be really purified by this waste; for it is certain, that by long continued working in the fire it may be rendered totally useless and destroyed; neither can we be assured that the other advantages pretended to result from their method of manufacture are of any consequence. The Spanish artists likewise value themselves on giving the inside of their barrels a very high polish; but the advantage of this, as has already been observed, is extremely dubious. The only thing requisite in a gun-barrel is that it do not lead; that is, that the mark of the bullet be not perceived on the inside after it has been discharged, by some of the lead rubbed off as it passes through. In the opinion of very good judges, therefore, it is better to take a barrel immediately after it has undergone the operation of fine-boring than to give it any higher polish; and in support of this opinion, M. de Marolles, an author of great reputation, informs us, that he has seen a barrel rough from the borer throw a charge of shot deeper into a quire of paper than one which was highly polished within, though the length, bore, and charge, were the same in both.\n\nAs the Spanish iron is universally allowed to be excellent, it has not been unreasonably supposed that the superiority of the barrels manufactured in that kingdom is owing more to the goodness of the materials than to the skill of the workmen. It must be observed, however, that instead of making the plates overlap a little in the place where they join, they give one of them a complete turn; so that every Spanish barrel may be said to be double throughout its whole length. The different portions of the iron are also forged in such a manner, that the grain of the iron is disposed in a spiral manner; whence it has the same effect with a ribbon or twisted barrel. The outside is finished by turning them in a lathe; whence probably they are always less elegantly wrought than the French and English pieces. The great value put upon them is also thought to be more owing to fancy than to any real good qualities they possess. Formerly they were made from three to three feet and a half long; their bore being such as to admit a bullet from 22 to 24 inches in the pound; and their weight from three to three pounds and a half. The reinforced part extends two-fifths of the length; and at 10 or 12 inches from the breech is placed a sight, such as is usually put upon rifle-barrels or those intended only for ball. According to Espinas, vaqueros-bearer to Philip IV., the weight of a Spanish barrel ought to be four pounds and a half when their length is 42 inches; but both weight and length are now much reduced, they seldom exceeding the dimension already mentioned. Next to the barrels made at Madrid, the most esteemed are those of Bustindui and St. Olabe at Placentia in Biscay; and of Jean and Clement Padwelteva, Ludal Pous, and Martin Marechal, at Barcelona; the usual price of them being about £31.10s. sterling.\n\nHaving now described the method of forging barrels, we shall next proceed to give an account of those imperfections to which they are sometimes liable, and which render them apt to burst or recoil with violence. The principal of these are the chink, crack, and flaw. The first is a small rent in the direction of the length of the barrel; the second across it; and the third is a kind of scale or small plate adhering to the barrel by a narrow base, from which it spreads out like the head of a nail from its shank, and when separated leaves a pit or hollow in the metal. The chink or flaw is of much worse consequence than the crack in fire-arms, the force of the powder being exerted more upon the circumference than the length of the barrel. The flaw is much more frequent than the chink, the latter scarce ever occurring but in plain barrels formed out of a single plate of iron, and then only when the metal is deficient in quality. When flaws happen on the outside, they are of no great consequence; but in the inside they are apt to lodge moisture and foulness which corrode the iron, and thus the cavity enlarges continually till the piece bursts. This accident, however, may arise from many other causes besides the defect of the barrel itself. The best pieces will burst when the ball is not sufficiently rammed home, so that a space is left between it and the powder. A very small windage or passage for the inflamed powder between the sides of the barrel and ball will be sufficient to prevent the accident; but if the ball has been forcibly driven down with an iron ramrod, so as to fill up the cavity of the barrel very exactly, the piece will almost certainly burst, if only a very small space be left between it and the powder; and the greater the space is, the more certainly does the event take place. Of this Mr. Robins gives a remarkable instance, accounting at the same time for the phenomenon. \"A moderate charge of powder (says he), when...\"\nit has expanded itself through the vacant space and reaches the ball, will, by the velocity each part has acquired, accumulate itself behind the ball, and will thereby be condensed prodigiously: whence, if the barrel be not of an extraordinary strength in that part, it must infallibly burst. The truth of this I have experienced in a very good Tower musket forged of very tough iron: for charging it with 12 pennyweights of powder, and placing the ball loofly 16 inches from the breech; on the firing of it, the part of the barrel just behind the bullet was swelled out to double its diameter like a blown bladder, and two large pieces of two inches in length were burst out of it.\" A piece will frequently burst from having its mouth stopped up with earth or snow; which accident sometimes happens to sportsmen in leaping a ditch, in which they have assisted themselves with their fowling-piece, putting the mouth of it to the ground; and when this does not happen, it is only to be accounted for from the stoppage being extremely slight. For the same reason a musket will certainly burst if it be fired with the muzzle immersed only a very little way in water. It will also burst from an overcharge; but when such an accident happens in other circumstances, it is most probably to be attributed to a defect in the workmanship, or in the iron itself. These defects are principally an imperfection in the welding, a deep flaw having taken place, or an inequality in the bore; which last is the most common of any, especially in the low-priced barrels. The reason of a barrel's bursting from an inequality in the bore is, that the elastic fluid, set loose by the inflammation of the powder, and endeavouring to expand itself in every direction, being repelled by the stronger parts, acts with additional force against the weaker ones, and frequently bursts through them, which it would not have done had the sides been equally thick and strong throughout. With regard to defects arising from the bad quality of the iron, it is impossible to say anything certain. As the choice of the materials depends entirely on the gunsmith, the only way to be assured of having a barrel made of proper metal is to purchase it from an artist of known reputation, and to give a considerable price for the piece.\n\nThe recoil of a piece becomes an object of importance only when it is very great; for every piece recoils in some degree when it is discharged. The most frequent cause of an excessive recoil is an inequality in the bore of the barrel; and by this it will be occasioned even when the inequality is too small to be perceived by the eye. The explanation of this upon mechanical principles indeed is not very easy: for as it is there an invariable law, that action and re-action are equal to one another, we should be apt to suppose that every time a piece is discharged it should recoil with the whole difference between the velocity of the bullet and that of the inflamed powder. But were this the case, no man could fire a musket without being destroyed; for the bullet flies out only with a velocity of 1700 feet in a second, or not much more, while that of the powder, as calculated by Mr Robins, is not less than 7000 feet in the same space. But was the recoil to be made with the difference of these velocities, or with one half of it, it is plain that no man could bear it. The same thing therefore must take place in the recoil of a musket which Dr Priestley observed in his experiments on the explosion of inflammable and dephlogisticated air, viz. that the force is exerted much more up on the part fartherest from that where the inflammation begins than upon that next to it. At any rate, however, the strength of the recoil will always be found proportional to the weight of the piece; that is, the lighter the piece is, the greater the recoil, and vice versa. The recoil may be increased by anything which retards the passage of the shot; whence it is also augmented by the fouling of the barrel by repeated firing. M. de Marolles informs us also, that a piece will recoil, if, from the breech-plug being made too short, some turns of the screw remain empty; as in these a part of the powder is lodged which forms an obstacle to the explosion; though in what manner this takes place is not very apparent, as, though the powder lodged there might contribute little or nothing to the force of the explosion, it can scarce be shown to stand in the way of it. The same author likewise informs us, that a barrel mounted upon a very straight stock will recoil more than upon one that is considerably bent. Sometimes also a fowling-piece will recoil from the sportsman applying it improperly to his shoulder; though this last circumstance seems likewise inexplicable. It is most probable therefore that the supposed greater recoil taken notice of in this case, arises only from the usual recoil being more sensibly felt in one position than another.\n\nThe cause to which too great a recoil in muskets has been usually attributed, is the placing of the touch-hole at some distance from the breech-plug; so that the powder is fired about the middle, or towards its fore part, rather than at its base. To avoid this, some artists form a groove or channel in the breech-plug as deep as the second or third turn of the screw; the touch-hole opening into this channel, and thus firing the powder at its very lowest part. It appears, however, from a number of experiments made upon this subject by M. le Clerc gunsmith to the king of France, that it made very little difference with regard to the recoil, whether the touch-hole was close to the breech or an inch distant from it. The only circumstance to be attended to with respect to its situation therefore is, that it be not quite close to the breech-plug; as in such a case it is found to be more apt to be choked up than when placed about a quarter of an inch from it.\n\nThe only other circumstance now to be determined with regard to musket-barrels is their proper length. Formerly it was supposed that the longer they were made, the greater would be the distance to which they carried the shot, and that without any limitation. This opinion continued to prevail till about half a century ago, when it was first proposed as a doubt whether long barrels carried farther than short ones. With regard to cannon, indeed, it had long before this time been known that they might be made too long; and Balthazar Killar, a celebrated cannon-founder in the reign of Louis XIV., was able to account for it. When asked by Mont. Sury de St Remy, why the culverin of Nancy, which is 22 feet long, did not carry a ball equally far with a shorter piece? he replied, that \"the powder, when inflamed, ought to quit the cavity of the piece in a certain time, in order to exert its whole force upon the bullet: by a longer stay, part of the force...\"\nforce is lost; and the same cause may produce an inequality in the shots, by giving a variation to the bullet, so as to destroy its rectilineal course, and throw it to one side or other of the mark.\" Mr. Robins, who on this as well as every other question in gunnery has almost exhausted the subject, informs us, that \"if a musket-barrel, of the common length and bore, be fired with a leaden bullet and half its weight of powder, and if the same barrel be afterwards shortened one-half and fired with the same charge, the velocity of the bullet in this shortened barrel will be about one-sixth less than what it was when the barrel was entire; and if, instead of shortening the barrel, it be increased to twice its usual length, when it will be near eight feet long, the velocity of the bullet will not hereby be augmented more than one-eighth part. And the greater the length of the barrel is in proportion to the diameter of the bullet, and the smaller the quantity of powder, the more inconsiderable will these alterations of velocity be.\" From these considerations it appears, that the advantages gained by long barrels are by no means equivalent to the disadvantages arising from the weight and incumbrance of using them; and from a multitude of experiments it is now apparent, that every one may choose what length he pleases, without any sensible detriment to the range of his piece. The most approved lengths are from 32 to 38 inches.\n\nAn opinion has generally prevailed among sportsmen, that by some unknown manoeuvre the gunsmith is able to make a piece, loaded with small shot, throw the contents so close together, that even at the distance of 40 or 50 paces the whole will be confined within the breadth of a hat. From such experiments as have been made on this subject, however, it appears, that the closeness or wideness with which a piece throws its shot is liable to innumerable variations from causes which no skill in the gunsmith can possibly reach. So variable are these causes, that there is no possibility of making the same piece throw its shot equally close twice successively. In general, however, the closer the wadding is, the better disposed the shot seems to be to fall within a small compass. The closeness of the shot therefore would seem to depend in a great measure on preventing the flame of the powder from inflaming itself among its particles: whence the following method is said to be practised with success by those who shoot for a wager at a mark with small shot; viz. to put in the shot by small quantities at a time, ramming down a little tow or thin paper over each; so as to fill the interstices of the grains, and thus prevent the flame from getting in amongst the grains and scattering them. In firing with small shot, a curious circumstance sometimes occurs, viz. that the grains, instead of being equally distributed over the space they strike, are thrown in clutters of 10, 12, 15, or more; whilst several considerable spaces are left without a grain in them. Sometimes one third or one-half of the charge will be collected into a clutter of this kind; nay, sometimes, though much more rarely, the whole charge will be collected into one mass, so as to pierce a board near an inch thick at the distance of 40 or 45 paces. Small barrels are said to be more liable to this clustering than large ones: and M. de Marolles informs us, that this is especially the case when the barrels are new, and likewise when they are freshly polished; though he acknowledges that it did not always happen with the barrels he employed even after they were polished. It is probable therefore, that the closeness of the shot depends on some circumstances relative to the wadding rather than to the mechanism of the barrel.\n\nSome pieces are composed of two or more barrels joined together; in which case the thickness of each of the barrels is somewhat less than in single-barrelled pieces. After being properly dressed, each of them is filed flat on the side where they are to join each other, so that they may fit more closely together. Two corresponding notches are then made at the muzzle and breech of each barrel; and into these are fitted two small pieces of iron to hold them more strongly together. Being then united by tinning the contiguous parts, a triangular piece of iron called the rib is fastened on in like manner, running the whole length on the upper side; which serves to hold them more strongly together. After this they are to be polished and coloured in the manner described for single barrels. Great care should be taken that the barrels joined in this manner should be quite equal in strength to one another, and that both should be quite upright, or of an equal thickness throughout. If any inequality takes place in the strength of the barrels, the weaker will be warped by the action of the stronger; and the warping from this cause has sometimes been so considerable as to render one of the barrels useless. To bring every part of the circumference of each barrel to an equal strength as nearly as possible, so that no part may be strained by the explosion, that side where they touch each other must be so reduced, that the partition between the two calibers may be no thicker than either barrel was at the same place before it was filed to join in this manner. Formerly the double-barrelled pieces were made with one barrel lying over the other, each barrel having a separate pan, hammer, and hammer-spring, but only one cock for both. The barrels were therefore made to turn round at the place where the breeches joined with the stock; so that as soon as one was fired off, the other could be brought into its place by pressing a spring moved by the guard with the right hand, while with the left the barrels were turned upon their common axis; and as soon as the charged barrel was thus brought into its proper situation, the spring descended into a notch and kept it firm. But this method was found to be too complicated and embarrassed, though upon the same plan three and four barrels were sometimes mounted upon one stock; but these pieces were intolerably heavy, and have no real superiority over the double-barrelled pieces which do not turn round, and which of consequence are now only made use of.\n\nIn forging barrels of all kinds, it is of considerable importance to have them made at first as near as possible to the weight intended when they are finished, so that very little be taken away by the boring and filing; for as the outer surface, by having undergone the action of the hammer more immediately than any other part, is rendered the most compact and pure, we should be careful to remove as little of it as possible; and the same holds, though in a less degree, with the inside which is to be cut with the borer. Pistool-barrels are forged in one piece, two at a time, joined by their muzzles;\nGUNTER, EDMUND, an excellent English mathematician and astronomer, was born in Hertfordshire in 1681, and studied at Westminster-school; from whence he removed to Oxford, where he took the degree of master of arts in 1666, and afterwards entered into holy orders. In 1615 he took the degree of bachelor of divinity; but being peculiarly eminent for his knowledge in the mathematics, he had two years before been chosen professor of astronomy in Gresham-college, London; where he distinguished himself by his lectures and writings. He invented a small portable quadrant; and also the famous line of proportions, which, after the inventor, is called Gunter's scale. He likewise published Canon Triangulorum; and a work entitled Of the Sector, Cross-staff, and other Instruments. This last was published, with an English translation of his Canon Triangulorum, in 4to, by Samuel Foster professor of Gresham college. Mr Gunter died at that college in 1626.\n\nGUNTER'S LINE, a logarithmic line, usually graduated upon scales, sectors, &c.\n\nIt is also called the line of lines and line of numbers; being only the logarithms graduated upon a ruler, which therefore serves to solve problems instrumentally in the same manner as logarithms do arithmetically. It is usually divided into 100 parts, every tenth whereof is numbered, beginning with 1 and ending with 10; so that if the first great division, marked 1, stand for one-tenth of any integer, the next division, marked 2, will stand for two tenths, 3, three-tenths, and so on; and the intermediate divisions will in like manner represent 100th-parts of the same integer. If each of the great divisions represent 10 integers, then will the lesser divisions stand for integers; and if the greater divisions be supposed each 100, the subdivisions will be each 10.\n\nUse of Gunter's Line. 1. To find the product of two numbers. From 1 extend the compasses to the multiplier; and the same extent, applied the same way from the multiplicand, will reach to the product. Thus if the product of 4 and 8 be required, extend the compasses from 1 to 4, and that extent laid from 8 the same way will reach to 32, their product. 2. To divide one number by another. The extent from the divisor to unity will reach from the dividend to the quotient; thus, to divide 36 by 4, extend the compasses from 4 to 1, and the same extent will reach from 36 to 9, the quotient sought. 3. To three given numbers to find a fourth proportional. Suppose the numbers 6, 8, 9: extend the compasses from 6 to 8; and this extent, laid from 9 the same way, will reach to 12, the fourth proportional required. 4. To find a mean proportional between any two given numbers. Suppose 8 and 32: extend the compasses from 8, in the left-hand part of the line, to 32 in the right; then bisecting this distance, its half will reach from 8 forward, or from 32 backward, to 16, the mean proportional sought. 5. To extract the square-root of any number. Suppose 25: bisect the distance between 1 on the scale and the point representing 25; then the half of this distance, set off from 1, will give the point representing the root 5. In the same manner the cube root, or that of any higher power, may be found by dividing the distance on the line between 1 and the given number into as many equal parts as the index of the power expresses; then one of those parts, set from 1, will find the point representing the root required.\n\nGUNTER'S QUADRANT, one made of wood, brass, &c., containing a kind of stereographic projection of the sphere, on the plane of the equinoctial; the eye being supposed placed in one of the poles.\n\nGUNTER'S SCALE, called by navigators simply the gunter, is a large plain scale, generally two feet long, and about an inch and a half broad, with artificial lines delineated on it, of great use in solving questions in trigonometry, navigation, &c.\n\nGUNWALE, or GUNNEL, is the uppermost wale of a ship, or that piece of timber which reaches on either side from the quarter-deck to the forecastle, being the uppermost bend which finishes the upper works of the hull, in that part in which are put the flanchions which support the waft-trees.\n\nGURK, an episcopal town of Carinthia in Germany seated on the river Gurk, in E.

See TRIGLA, ICHTHYOLOGY Index.\n\nGUST, a sudden and violent squall of wind, bursting from the hills upon the sea so as to endanger the shipping near the shore. These are peculiar to some coasts, as those of South Barbary and Guinea.\n\nGUSTAVIA, a genus of plants belonging to the monadelphia class. See BOTANY Index.\n\nGUSTAVUS I, king of Sweden, son of Eric de Vasa duke of Gripsholm. Christian II, king of Denmark having made himself master of the kingdom of Sweden, confined Gustavus at Copenhagen; but he making his escape, wandered a long time in the forests, till the cruelties of the tyrant having occasioned a revolution, he was first declared governor of Sweden, and in 1513 elected king. This prince introduced Lutheranism into his dominions, which in a little time spread itself all over the kingdom. He died in 1560; having made his kingdom hereditary, which was before elective. See SWEDEN.\n\nGustavus Adolphus, surnamed the Great, king of Sweden, was born at Stockholm in 1594, and succeeded his father Charles in 1611. He espoused the cause of the Protestants in Germany, who were oppressed and almost entirely ruined by the emperor Ferdinand. He was a great warrior, and gained many victories, of which an account is given under the article SWEDEN. He was at last killed in the battle of Lutzen, where his troops got the victory, and defeated two of the emperor's armies.\n\nGUTHALUS, or GUTTALUS, in Ancient Geography, is thought to be the Pydrus of Ptolemy. Now the Oder, which rising in Moravia, runs through Silesia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania, into the Baltic.\n\nGUTTA, a Latin term for what in English we call drop.\n\nGutta Rosea, in Medicine, denotes a red or pimpled face; a distemper which, though not always owing its original to hard drinking, is nevertheless most incident to tipplers of strong beer, wines, spirits, &c.\n\nGutta Serena, a distemper in which the patient, without\nout any apparent fault in the eye, is deprived of sight.\n\nSee MEDICINE Index.\n\nGUTTA, in Architecture, are ornaments in the form of little cones used in the Doric corniche, or on the architrave underneath the triglyphs, representing a sort of drops or bells.\n\nGUT-TIE, a disease incident to oxen and male calves at the time of castration. In the county of Hereford, those who breed cattle open the scrotum of their calves, and forcibly extract the testicles with their teeth, in consequence of which every vessel is ruptured belonging to these parts. The vasa deferentia are separated from the testicles, and form a kind of bow from the urethra, where they are united to the transverse muscles. The jejunum is the part of the gut that is tied, where it turns from the right to the left, and from the left to the right. As the bow of the gut hangs over the vasa deferentia, a hitch is formed over the bow of the gut, analogous to what is made by a carter over his cart line. In this manner an obstruction is occasioned in the bowels, which terminates in a mortification, commonly proving fatal in the course of four days.\n\nThe symptoms which attend a gut-tie resemble those of an incurable colic, or mortification of the intestines. To ascertain the distinction between the gut-tie and the colic, the hand and arm of the operator ought to be oiled, in which state it should be introduced into the anus. Here the string will be found united to the muscles, and without occasioning any pain to the animal, may be traced with ease to the stricture by the hand.\n\nMr Harris, farmer at Wickton, informs us, that the gut-tie may be prevented by the following simple and easy method of castration. \"Open the scrotum, loosen out the testicles, and tie the several vessels with a waxed thread or silk, or fear them with a hot iron, to prevent their bleeding, as in the common way of cutting colts. This method can never displace the vessels of the bladder, testicles, kidneys, or intestines; all of which remain covered or attached to the peritoneum, or lining of the abdomen of the beast, which renders it impossible that there should ever be a stricture or tie on the gut.\n\nGUTTURAL, a term applied to letters or sounds pronounced or formed as it were in the throat.\n\nGUTTY, in Heraldry, a term used when anything is charged or sprinkled with drops. In blazoning, the colour of the drops is to be named: as gutty of sable, of gules, &c.\n\nGUY, THOMAS, an eminent bookseller, founder of the hospital for sick and lame in Southwark bearing his name, was the son of Thomas Guy lighterman and coal-dealer in Horley-down, Southwark. He was put apprentice, in 1680, to a bookseller in the porch of Mercer's chapel; and set up trade with a stock of about £200, in the house that forms the angle between Cornhill and Lombard-street. The English Bibles being at that time very badly printed, Mr Guy engaged with others in a scheme for printing them in Holland and importing them; but this being put a stop to, he contracted with the university of Oxford for their privilege of printing them, and carried on a great bible-trade for many years to a considerable advantage. Thus he began to accumulate money, and his gains rested in his hands; for being a single man, and very penurious, his expenses could not be great, when it was his custom to dine on his shop-counter with no other table-covering than an old newspaper; and besides he was not more scrupulous about the style of his apparel. The bulk of his fortune, however, was acquired by purchasing seamen's tickets during Queen Anne's wars, and by South-Sea stock in the memorable year 1720. To show what great events spring from trivial causes, it is asserted, that the public owe the dedication of the greatest part of his immense fortune to charitable purposes, to the indirect officiousness of his maid-servant in interfering with the mending of the pavement before the door. Guy had agreed to marry her, and, preparatory to his nuptials, had ordered the pavement before his door, which was in a neglected state, to be mended, as far as to a particular stone which he pointed out. The maid, while her master was out, innocently looking on the paviers at work, saw a broken place that they had not repaired, and mentioned it to them: but they told her that Mr Guy had directed them not to go so far. Well, says she, do you mend it; tell him I bade you, and I know he will not be angry. It happened, however, that the poor girl presumed too much on her influence over her careful lover, with whom a few extraordinary shillings expense turned the scale totally against her: the men obeyed; Guy was enraged to find his orders exceeded, his matrimonial scheme was renounced, and so he built hospitals in his old age. In the year 1707 he built and furnished three wards on the north side of the outer court of St Thomas's Hospital in Southwark, and gave £100 to it annually for eleven years preceding the erection of his own hospital: and, some time before his death, erected the stately iron gate, with the large houses on each side, at the expense of about £3000. He was 76 years of age when he formed the design of building the hospital contiguous to that of St Thomas's, which bears his name, and lived to see it roofed in, dying in the year 1724. The charge of erecting this vast pile amounted to £18,793l. and he left £219,499l. to endow it; a much larger sum than had ever been dedicated to charitable uses in this kingdom by any one man. He erected an alms-house with a library at Tanworth in Staffordshire (the place of his mother's nativity, and for which he was representative in parliament) for 14 poor men and women; and for their pensions, as well as for the putting out poor children apprentices, bequeathed £25l. a-year. Lastly, he bequeathed £1000, to every one who could prove themselves in any degree related to him.\n\nGuy, a rope used to keep steady any weighty body whilst it is hoisting or lowering, particularly when the ship is shaken by a tempestuous sea.\n\nGuy is likewise a large slack rope, extending from the head of the main-mast to the head of the fore-mast, and having two or three large blocks, fastened to the middle of it. This is chiefly employed to sustain the tackle used to hoist in and out the cargo of a merchant ship, and is accordingly removed from the mast-head as soon as the vessel is laden or delivered.\n\nGuy's Cliff, in Warwickshire, a great cliff on the west side of the Avon and the north side of Warwick, where in the Britons' time was an oratory, and in that of the Saxons an hermitage, where Guy earl of Warwick,\nwick, who is said to have retired to it after his fatigues by the toils and pleasures of the world, built a chapel, and cohabited with the hermit; and that from thence it had the name. This hermitage was kept up to the reign of Henry VI., when Rich. Beauchamp earl of Warwick established a chantry here, and in memory of the famous Guy erected a large statue of him in the chapel eight feet in height, and raised a roof over the adjacent springs. The chapel is in the parish of St Nicholas, in the suburbs of Warwick.\n\nGUYON, JOHANNA MARY BOURIERS DE LA MOTHE, a French lady, memorable for her writings, and for her sufferings in the cause of Quietism, was descended from a noble family, and born at Montargis in 1648. She gave some extraordinary symptoms of illumination from her earliest infancy, and tried to take the veil before she was of age to dispose of herself; but her parents obliged her to marry a gentleman to whom they had promised her. She was a widow at the age of 28; when distinguishing herself in, and making many converts to, the way of contemplation and prayer known by the name of Quietism, complaints were made of her spiritualism, and she was confined by order of the king, and severely examined for eight months. She was discharged; but was afterwards involved in the persecution of the archbishop of Cambrai, and thrown into the Bastile, where she underwent many examinations; but nothing being made out against her, she once more obtained her liberty, and lived private to her death in 1717. She spent her latter years in mystical reveries; covering her tables, ceilings, and every thing that would receive them, with the fancies of a visionary imagination. Her pious verses were collected after her death in 5 vols., entitled Cantiques spirituels, ou d'Emblemes sur l'Amour Divin. Her publications were, Le moyen court et très facile de faire Oraisons; and Le Cantique des Cantiques de Salomon interprété selon le sens mystique; which were condemned by the archbishop of Paris.\n\nGUZ, an Indian measure which varies in different places, but is in general equal to a yard of English measure. The guz of Akbar did not exceed 41 fingers.\n\nGWINIAD. See SALMO, Ichthyology Index.\n\nGYARUS, in Ancient Geography, one of the Cyclades, 12 miles in compass, lying to the east of Delos. It was a desert island, and allotted for a place of banishment by the Romans.\n\nGYBING, the act of shifting any boom-fall from one side of the mast to the other.\n\nIn order to understand this operation more clearly, it is necessary to remark, that by a boom-fall is meant any fall whose bottom is extended by a boom, the fore-end of which is hooked to its respective mast; so as to swing occasionally on either side of the vessel, describing an arch, of which the mast will be the centre. As the wind or the course changes, it also becomes frequently necessary to change the position of the boom, together with its fall, which is accordingly shifted to the other side of the vessel as a door turns upon its hinges. The boom is pushed out by the effort of the wind upon the fall, and is restrained in a proper situation by a strong tackle communicating with the vessel's stern, and called the fleet. It is also confined on the fore part by another tackle called the guy.\n\nGYGEUS, in Ancient Geography; called also Co-\n\nlous; a lake of Lydia, distant 40 stadia, or five miles, from Sardis.\n\nGYGES, in fabulous history, a Lydian, to whom Candaules king of the country showed his wife naked. The queen was so incensed at this instance of imprudence and infirmity in her husband, that she ordered Gyges either to prepare for death himself, or to put Candaules to death. He chose the latter; and, marrying the queen, ascended the vacant throne about 718 years before the Christian era. He was the first of the Mermnadæ who reigned in Lydia. He reigned 38 years, and distinguished himself by the immense presents which he made to the oracle of Delphi (Herod. i. c. 8.)—According to Plato, Gyges descended into a chasm of the earth, where he found a brazen horse, whose sides he opened, and saw within the body the carcass of a man of uncommon size, from whose finger he took a brazen ring. This ring, when he put it on his finger, rendered him invisible; and by means of its virtue he introduced himself to the queen, murdered her husband, and married her and usurped the crown of Lydia. (Cic. Off. iii. c. 9.)\n\nGYMNASIARCH, in antiquity, the director of the gymnasiwm. He had two deputies under him; the one called xyloarch, who presided over the athlete, and had the oversight of wrestling; the other was gymnastes, who had the direction of all other exercises.\n\nGYMNASIUM, in Grecian antiquity, a place fitted for performing exercises of the body, &c.—The word is Greek, formed of γυμνός, \"naked;\" by reason they anciently put off their clothes, to practise with the more freedom.\n\nGymnasia, according to Potter, were first used at Lacedemon, but were afterwards very common in all parts of Greece; and imitated, very much augmented, and improved, at Rome. There were three principal gymnasia at Athens; the academy where Plato taught; the Lyceum, noted for Aristotle's lectures; and the Cynoarques, allotted for the populace.\n\nVitruvius describes the structure and form of the ancient gymnasia, lib. v. cap. ii. They were called gymnasia, because several of the exercises were performed naked; and palestra, from wrestling, which was one of the most usual exercises there: the Romans sometimes also called them therme, because the baths and bagnios made a principal part of the building.—It appears that they did not perform their exercises quite naked so early as the time of Homer, but always in drawers; which they did not lay aside before the 32d Olympiad. One Orsippus is said to have been the first who introduced the practice: for having been worsted by means of his drawers undoing and entangling him, he threw them quite aside, and the rest afterwards imitated him. They were not single edifices, but a knot of buildings united, being sufficiently spacious to hold many thousands of people at once; and having room enough for philosophers, rhetoricians, and the professors of all other sciences to read their lectures,—and wrestlers, dancers, and all others who had a mind to exercise,—at the same time without the least disturbance or interruption. They consisted of a great many parts. Vitruvius recites no less than 12, viz. 1. The exterior porticoes, where the philosophers, rhetoricians, mathematicians, physicians, and other virtuosi, read public lectures, and where they also disputed and re-\nhearsed their performances. 2. The ephebeum, where the youth assembled very early, to learn their exercises in private, without any spectators. 3. The corycium, apodyterion, or gymnasterion, a kind of wardrobe, where they stripped, either to bathe or exercise. 4. The elaeothecium, alipterion, or unctuarium, appointed for the unctions, which either preceded or followed the use of the bath, wrestling, pancratia, &c. 5. The coniferium or conistra, in which they covered themselves with sand or dust, to dry up the oil or sweat. 6. The palestra, properly so called, where they practised wrestling, the pugilate, pancratia, and divers other exercises. 7. The sphaeriterium or tennis-court, referred for exercises wherein they used balls. 8. Large paved alleys, which comprehended the space between the porticoes and the walls wherewith the edifice was surrounded. 9. The xyfti, which were porticoes for the wrestlers in winter or bad weather. 10. Other xylitis or open alleys, allotted for summer and fine weather, some of which were quite open, and others planted with trees. 11. The baths, consisting of several different apartments. 12. The stadium, a large space of a semicircular form, covered with sand, and surrounded with seats for the spectators.\n\nFor the administration of the gymnasia, there were different officers: the principal were, 1. The gymnasiarcha, who was the director and superintendent of the whole. 2. The xylitarcha, who presided in the xylitis or stadium. 3. The gymnasta, or master of the exercises, who understood their different effects, and could accommodate them to the different complexions of the athlete. 4. The pedotribus, whose business was mechanically to teach the exercises, without understanding their theory or use. Under these four officers were a number of subalterns, whose names distinguished their different functions.\n\nThe gymnastic exercises may be reduced to two general classes; as they depend either on the action of the body alone, or as they require external agents or instruments. The latter consisted chiefly in mounting the horse, driving the chariot, and swimming. The former were chiefly of two kinds; orchestric, and palestric.\n\nThe orchestric comprehended, 1. Dancing. 2. Cubitifice, or the art of tumbling. 3. Sphaeristice or tennis, including all the exercises with pila or balls.\n\nThe palestric comprised all exercises under the denomination palestric; as wrestling, boxing, pancratia, hoplomachia, running, leaping, throwing the discus, the exercise of the javelin, and that of the hoop, denominated by the Greeks τροχες, which consisted in rolling an iron hoop five or six feet in diameter, befit with iron rings, the noise of which apprising the people to give way, afforded them also an amusement. Both strength and skill were requisite in directing this hoop, which was to be driven with an iron rod. To these must also be added the exercises belonging to the medicinal gymnastics; as, 1. Walking. 2. Vociferation, or shouting. 3. Holding one's breath. Hoffman enumerates no fewer than 55 sorts of exercises that were practised in the gymnasia.\n\nGYMNASTICS, GYMNASTIC, or the GYMNASTIC art, denotes the art of performing exercises of the body, whether for defence, health, or diversion. See GYMNASIUM.\n\nSeveral modern writers have treated of this art. M. Gymnasiere Burette has given the history of gymnastics in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions.\n\nOn the first establishment of society, men, being apprised of the necessity of military exercises for repelling the insults of their neighbours, instituted games and proposed prizes to animate their youth to combats of divers kinds. And as running, leaping, strength and dexterity of arm in throwing the javelin, driving a ball, or toiling a quoit, together with wrestling, &c., were exercises suited to the manner of fighting in those days; so the youth vied to excel in them, in the presence of the aged, who sat as their judges, and dispensed prizes to the conquerors; till what was originally only amusement, became at length a matter of such importance, as to interest great cities and entire nations in its practice. Hence arose an emulation and eagerness to excel, in hopes, one day, of being proclaimed and crowned conquerors in the public games, which was the highest honour a mortal could arrive at: nay, they went so far as to imagine, that even gods and demigods were not insensible of what men were so captivated with; and, in consequence hereof, to introduce the greatest part of these exercises into their religious ceremonies, the worship of their gods, and the funeral honours done to the manes of the dead.\n\nThough it be hard to determine the precise epocha of the gymnastic art, yet it appears from several passages in Homer, and particularly the 23d book of the Iliad, where he describes the games celebrated at the funeral of Patroclus, that it was not unknown at the time of the Trojan war. From that description, which is the earliest monument now extant of the Grecian gymnastics, it appears, that they had chariot-races, boxing, wrestling, foot-races, gladiators, throwing the discus, drawing the bow, and hurling the javelin; and it should seem from the particular account Homer gives of these exercises, that even then the gymnastic art wanted little of perfection: so that when Galen says there was no gymnastic art in Homer's days, and that it began to appear no earlier than Plato, he is to be understood of the medicinal gymnastics only. This last, indeed, had its rise later; because, while men continued sober and laborious, they had no occasion for it; but when luxury and idleness had reduced them to the sad necessity of applying to physicians, these, who had found that nothing contributed so much to the preservation and re-establishment of health as exercises, proportioned to the different complexions, ages, and sexes, did not fail to refer them to the practice of gymnastics.\n\nAccording to Plato, one Herodicus, prior a little time to Hippocrates, was the first who introduced this art into physic; and his successors, convinced by experience of its usefulness, applied themselves in earnest to improve it. Hippocrates, in his book of Regimen, has given instances of it, where he treats of exercise in general, and of the particular effects of walking, with regard to health; also of the different sorts of races, either on foot or horseback; leaping, wrestling, the exercise of the suspended ball, called corycium, chronomy, unctions, frictions, rolling in the sand, &c. But as physicians did not adopt all the exercises of the gymnastic art in their practice, it came to be divided between them and the masters of martial and athletic exercises, who kept schools, the number of which was greatly\ngreatly increased in Greece. At length the Romans also caught the same taste; and, adopting the military and athletic exercises of the Greeks, they improved and advanced them to the utmost pitch of magnificence, not to say extravagance. But the declension of the empire involved the arts in its ruin, and, among others, gymnastics and medicine; which last unhappily then relinquished the title it had to the former, and has neglected to resume it ever since.\n\nGYMNOPYRIS, in *Natural History*, an old name given to some species of pyrites. See PYRITES, MINERALOGY Index.\n\nGYMNOSOPHISTS, a set of Indian philosophers, famous in antiquity; so denominated from their going barefoot. The word is formed of the Greek γυμνοσοφιστής, q.d. a sophist or philosopher who goes naked.\n\nThis name was given to the Indian philosophers, whom the excessive heat of the country obliged to go naked; as that of Peripatetics was given to those who philosophized walking. The Gymnosophists, however, did not go absolutely naked; but only clothed themselves no farther than modesty required. There were some of these sages in Africa; but the most celebrated clan of them was in India. The African gymnosophists dwelt upon a mountain in Ethiopia, near the Nile, without the accommodation either of house or cell. They did not form themselves into societies like those of India; but each had his private recess, where he studied and performed his devotions by himself. If any person had killed another by chance, he applied to these sages for absolution, and submitted to whatever penances they enjoined. They observed an extraordinary frugality, and lived only upon the fruits of the earth. Lucan attributes to these Gymnosophists several new discoveries in astronomy.\n\nAs to the Indian Gymnosophists, they dwelt in the woods, where they lived upon the wild products of the earth, and never drank wine nor married. Some of them practiced physic, and traveled from one place to another; these were particularly famous for their remedies against barrenness. Some of them, likewise, pretended to practice magic, and to foretell future events.\n\nIn general, the Gymnosophists were wise and learned men; their maxims and discourses, recorded by historians, do not in the least favour of a barbarous education; but are plainly the result of great sense and deep thought. They kept up the dignity of their character to so high a degree, that it was never their custom to wait upon any body, not even upon princes themselves. They believed the immortality and transmigration of the soul: they placed the chief happiness of man in a contempt of the goods of fortune, and the pleasures of sense, and gloried in having given faithful and disinterested counsels to princes and magistrates. It is said, that when they became old and infirm, they threw themselves into a pile of burning wood, in order to prevent the miseries of an advanced age. One of them, named Calanus, thus burnt himself in the presence of Alexander the Great.\n\nApuleius* describes the Gymnosophists thus: \"They are all devoted to the study of wisdom, both the elder masters and the younger pupils; and what to me appears the most amiable thing in their character is, that they have an aversion to idleness and indolence: accordingly, as soon as the table is spread, before a bit of victuals be brought, the youths are all called together from their several places and offices, and the masters examine them what good they have done since the sunrise: here one relates something he has discovered by meditation; another has learned something by demonstration; and as for those who have nothing to allege why they should dine, they are turned out to work fasting.\"\n\nThe great leader of the Gymnosophists, according to Jerome, was one Buddas, called by Clemens Butta, who is ranked by Suidas among the Brachmans. That last author makes Buddas the preceptor of Manes the Persian, the founder of the Gymnosophists.\n\nGYMINOSPERMIA, in Botany, (from γυμνός \"naked,\" and σπέρμα \"seed\") the first order in Linnæus's clasps of didynamia. It comprehends the plants of that class which have naked seeds. The seeds are constantly four in number, except in one genus, viz., phryma, which is monopernous. See BOTANY, p. 65, and 211.\n\nGYMNOTUS, a genus of fishes belonging to the order of apodes. See Ichthyology Index.\n\nGYNÆCEUM, among the ancients, the apartment of the women, a separate room in the inner part of the house, where they employed themselves in spinning, weaving, and needle-work.\n\nGYNÆOCRACY, denotes the government of women, or a state where women are capable of the supreme command. Such are Britain and Spain.\n\nGYNÆOCRATUMENI, an ancient people of Sarmatia Europæa, inhabiting the eastern banks of the river Tanais, near its opening into the Palaus Maeotis; thus called, as authors relate, because they had no women among them; or rather because they were under the dominion of women. The word is formed of γυναίκα woman, and καταρχάων, vanquished, of καταρχάω, I overcome, q.d. overcome by women.\n\nPa. Hardouin, in his notes on Pliny, says, they were thus called, because, after a battle which they lost against the Amazons, on the banks of the Thermodon, they were obliged to have venereal commerce with them, in order to get them children; et quod victricibus sequantur ad procurandam eis foliolum.—Hardouin calls them the husbands of the Amazons, Amazonum connubia; for, as the author observes, the word unde must be retrenched from Pliny, having been foiled into the text by people who were not masters of the author's meaning, unde Amazonum connubia. See AMAZONS. They who take the Amazons for a fabulous people, will conclude the same of the Gynaecocraticumensians.\n\nGYNANDRIA, (from γυναῖκα \"woman;\" and ἀνήρ \"man\"), the name of the 20th class in Linnæus's sexual system, consisting of plants with hermaphrodite flowers, in which the stamens are placed upon the style, or pillar-shaped receptacle resembling a style, which rises in the middle of the flower, and bears both the stamens and stigma; that is, both the supposed organs of generation. See BOTANY, p. 65.\n\nThe flowers of this class, says Linnæus, have a monstrous appearance, arising, as he imagines, from the singular and unusual situation of the parts of fructification.\n\nGYPSIES,\nGYPSIES, or EGYPTIANS, an outlandish tribe of vagabonds, who disguising themselves in uncouth habits, smearing their faces and bodies, and framing to themselves a canting language, wander up and down; and, under pretence of telling fortunes, curing diseases, &c., abuse the common people, trick them of their money, and steal all that they can come at.\n\nThey are a strange kind of commonwealth among themselves of wandering impostors and jugglers, who made their first appearance in Germany about the beginning of the 16th century. Munster, it is true, who is followed and relied upon by Spelman, fixes the time of their first appearance to the year 1417; but as he owns that the first whom he ever saw were in 1529, it is probably an error of the press for 1517; especially as other historians inform us, that when Sultan Selim conquered Egypt in the year 1517, several of the natives refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and revolted under one Zinganeus; whence the Turks call them Zinganees; but being at length surrounded and banished, they agreed to disperse in small parties all over the world, where their supposed skill in the black art gave them an universal reception in that age of superstition and credulity. In the compass of a very few years they gained such a number of idle profelytes (who imitated their language and complexion, and took themselves to the same arts of chromancy, begging, and pilfering), that they became troublesome, and even formidable, to most of the states of Europe.—Hence they were expelled from France in the year 1562, and from Spain in 1591. And the government of England took the alarm much earlier; for in 1530 they are described by Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 10. as \"an outlandish people calling themselves Egyptians, using no craft nor feat of merchandise, who have come into this realm, and gone from place to place, and place to place, in great companies, and used great, subtle, and crafty means to deceive the people; bearing them in hand that they by palmistry could tell men's and women's fortunes; and so many times by craft and subtilty have deceived the people of their money, and also have committed many heinous felonies and robberies.\" Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return under pain of imprisonment, and forfeiture of their goods and chattels; and upon their trials for any felony which they may have committed, they shall not be entitled to a jury de mediate lingua. And afterwards it is enacted, by statutes 1st and 2d Ph. and Mary, c. 4. and 5th Eliz. c. 25. that if any such persons shall be imported into the kingdom, the importer shall forfeit 40l. And if the Egyptians themselves remain one month in the kingdom, or if any person being 14 years old, whether natural-born subject or stranger, which hath been seen or found in the fellowship of such Egyptians, or which hath disguised him or herself like them, shall remain in the same one month at one or several times, it is felony without benefit of clergy. And Sir M. Hale informs us, that at one Suffolk affizes no less than 13 persons were executed upon these statutes a few years before the restoration. But, to the honour of our national humanity, there are no instances more modern than this of carrying these laws into practice; and the last sanguinary act itself now repealed by 23 Geo. III. c. 54.\n\nIn Scotland they seem to have enjoyed some share of indulgence; for a writ of privy seal, dated 1594, supports John Faw, lord and earl of Little Egypt, in the execution of justice on his company and folk, conform to the laws of Egypt, and in punishing certain persons there named who rebelled against him, left him, robbed him, and refused to return home with him, James's subjects are commanded to assist in apprehending them, and in afflicting Faw and his adherents to return home. There is a like writ in his favour from Mary queen of Scots 1553, and in 1554 he obtained a pardon for the murder of Numan Small. So that it appears he had staid long in Scotland, and perhaps some of the time in England; and from him this kind of strolling people might receive the name of Faw Gang, which they still retain.\n\nA very circumstantial account of this singular race of vagrants has been lately given in an express Inquiry concerning them, written in German by H. M. G. Grellman, and translated by Mr Raper. It is incredible to think how this regular swarm of banditti has spread itself over the face of the earth. They wander about in Asia, in the interior parts of Africa, and like locusts have overrun most of the European nations. In the reigns of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, as we have seen, they were set up as a mark of general persecution in England; yet their numbers do not appear to have much diminished. Spain is supposed by Mr Twiss to contain 40,000 of these vagrants; but by others 60,000; and by some even double that number. They are less numerous in France in consequence of the strictness of the police. In Italy they abound, especially in the dominions of the church, on account of the bad police and the prevalence of superstition, which permit and entice them to deceive the ignorant. They are scattered, though not in great numbers, through Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia; but their chief population is in the south-east parts of Europe, which seem to be the general rendezvous of the gypsy nation. At a moderate computation Europe contains more than seven hundred thousand of these vagabonds.—For near four centuries they have wandered through the world; and in every region, and among every people, whether barbarous or civilized, they have continued equally unchanged by the lapse of time, the variation of climate, and the force of example. Their singular physiognomy and particular manners are the same in every country.—Their swarthy complexion receives no darker shade from the burning sun of Africa, nor any fairer tincture from the temperate climates of Europe: they contract no additional laziness in Spain, nor acquire any new industry in England; in Turkey they behold the mosque and the crescent with equal indifference as they do the reformed and the catholic church in Europe. In the neighbourhood of civilized life they continue barbarous; and, beholding around them cities and settled inhabitants, they live in tents or holes in the earth, and wander from place to place as fugitives and vagabonds.\n\nThey are passionately fond of ornaments; in which however they consult neither propriety nor constancy; they will wear an old laced coat, while the rest of their garments scarcely hang together. In Hungary and Transylvania their summer habitations are tents; their winter ones holes 10 or 12 feet deep in the earth, except...\ncept such as keep inns, or exercise trades. They are fond of plate, particularly silver cups, which they bury under the hearth for security. Their principal occupations are, smith's work, or tinkers, or wooden ware, and horse-dealing; and in Hungary and Transylvania they are executioners of criminals, flayers of dead beasts, and walkers of gold. The women deal in old cloaths, prostitution, wanton dances, and fortune-telling. Notwithstanding these occupations the majority of this people are lazy, beggars, and thieves. They bring up their children to their own professions, and are very fond of them. They have few disorders, except the measles and smallpox, and weakness in their eyes, occasioned by the smoke; and live to an advanced age, with a strong attachment to life. Their physic is laffron in their soups, or bleeding.\n\nThese people, however, appear to be distinguished by different singularities in different countries. At least in the following circumstances the German gypsies differ widely from those we commonly meet with in England. It is a great fault to them, our author says, whenever they can procure a roast of cattle that died of any distemper. It is all one to them, whether it be carrion of a sheep, hog, cow, or other beast, horse-flesh only excepted; they are so far from being disgusted with it, that to eat their fill of such a meal, is to them the height of epicurism. When any one censures their taste, or shows surprize at it, they answer, \"The flesh of a beast which God kills, must be better than that killed by the hand of man.\" They therefore take every opportunity of getting such dainties. That they take carrion from a layfall, as is affirmed of the gypsies in Hungary, is by no means certain, any more than that they eat horse-flesh. But if a beast out of a herd dies, and they find it before it becomes rotten and putrid, or if a farmer gives them notice of a cow dead, they proceed, without hesitation, to get possession of this booty. Their favourite object is animals that have been destroyed by fire; therefore, whenever a conflagration has happened, either in town or country, the next day the gypsies, from every neighbouring quarter, assemble and draw the suffocated half-consumed beasts out of the ashes. Men, women, and children, in troops, are extremely busy, joyfully carrying the flesh home to their dwelling-places; they return several times, provide themselves plentifully with this roast meat, and glutonize in their huts as long as their noble fare lasts.\n\nThe gypsies have, at least in Transylvania, a sort of regular government, rather nominal than real or effective. They have their leaders or chiefs, whom they distinguish by the Slavonian title, Waywoode. To this dignity every person who is of a family descended from a former waywoode; but the preference is generally given to those who have the best clothes and the most wealth; who are of a large stature, and not past the meridian of life.—Of religion, however, they have no sense; though, with their usual cunning and hypocrisy, they profess the established faith of every country in which they live. They also speak the languages of the respective countries, yet have a language of their own; from whence derived, authors differ. The only science which they have attained is music. Their poetry is ungrammatical indecent rhyme.\n\nTheir general character and capacities are thus described: Imagine people of a childish way of thinking; their minds filled with raw, undigested conceptions; guided more by sense than reason; using understanding and reflection so far only as they promote the gratification of any particular appetite; and you have a perfect sketch of the gypsies' character. They are lively, uncommonly loquacious and chattering; fickle in the extreme, consequently inconsistent in their pursuits; faithless to everybody, even their own self; void of the least emotion of gratitude, frequently rewarding benefits with the most insidious malice. Fear makes them flatteringly compliant when under subjection; but having nothing to apprehend, like other timorous people, they are cruel. Desire of revenge often causes them to take the most desperate resolutions. To such a degree of violence is their fury sometimes excited, that a mother has been known, in the excess of passion, to take her little infant by the feet, and with it strike the object of her anger, when no other instrument has readily presented itself. They are so addicted to drinking, as to sacrifice what is most necessary to them, that they may feast their palate with spirits. They have, too, what one would little expect, an enormous share of vanity, which shows itself in their fondness for fine clothes, and their gait and deportment when dressed in them. One might imagine, that this pride would have the good effect to render a gypsy cautious not to be guilty of such crimes as subject him to public shame; but here comes in the levity of character, for he never looks to the right nor to the left in his transactions. In an hour's time he forgets that he is just united from the whipping post. But their pride is grounded on mere idle conceit, as appears plainly from their making it a point of honour to abuse their companions, and put on a terrible appearance in the public market, where they are sure to have many spectators; they cry out, make a violent noise, challenge their adversary to fight, but very seldom anything comes of it. Thus the gypsy seeks honour, of which his ideas coincide very little with those of other people, and sometimes deviate entirely from propriety.\n\n\"Nothing (continues our author) can exceed the unrestrained depravity of manners existing among these people, I allude particularly to the other sex. Unchecked by any idea of shame, they give way to every desire. The mother endeavours, by the most scandalous arts, to train up her daughter for an offering to sensuality; and this is scarce grown up before she becomes the seducer of others. Laziness is so prevalent among them, that were they to subsist by their own labour only, they would hardly have bread for two of the seven days in the week. This indolence increases their propensity to stealing and cheating, the common attendants on idleness. They seek to avail themselves of every opportunity to satisfy their lawless desires. Their universal bad character therefore for fickleness, infidelity, ingratitude, revenge, malice, rage, depravity, laziness, knavery, thievishness, and cunning, though not deficient in capacity and cleverness, render these people of no use in society, except as soldiers to form marauding parties. Persons in their company, and under their disguise, have formed dangerous designs against cities and countries. They have been banished from almost all civilized states, in their turn, except Hungary and Transylvania, and to little purpose.\" Our author is of opinion,\nopinion, that as Turkey would allow them toleration, it would be better for the European states to take some steps for cultivating and civilizing them, and making them useful. But while they are inflexible of religion and strongly attached to their own manners, it is to be feared the attempt will be impracticable. This appears from a very intelligent Hungarian lady's experience on the subject, communicated in a letter as follows: 'There are a great number of them on my estates, but I have permitted two families in particular to establish themselves at the place of my own residence, under the express condition that no others shall come here and join them. I took all possible pains to make them reasonable creatures. I let the elder ones to work; the younger ones tend the cattle. I observed that they were more fond of horses than any thing else; for which reason I placed a gypsy under each groom. I had their children clothed, that none of them might be running about naked, according to their usual practice. It appeared, however, that custom was become nature with them. The old ones worked diligently so long as any body stood over them; the moment their backs were turned, they all got together in a circle, their legs across, facing the sun, and chattered. Thus they cannot possibly earn more, indeed hardly so much, as would find them bread, although very cheap with us; for the bread I give them does not stand me in half a kreutzer the pound. Even in winter they cannot bear a hat on their head or shoes on their feet. The boys run like wild things wherever they are sent, either on foot or on horseback; but they spoil horses uselessly, beat them on the head, jerk the bits in their mouths, so as to make them run down with blood. They cannot be brought by any means whatever to dress horses. Clothe them as you will, they always fall or lose their clothes. In a word, one cannot but consider them as void of reason; it is really shocking to see even well grown children put whatever they find into their mouths, like infants before they can speak; wherefore they eat every thing, even carrion, let it stink never so much. Where a mortality happens among the cattle, there these wretched beings are to be found in the greatest numbers.'\n\nThe origin of this people, as we have seen, has been generally believed to be Egyptian; and that belief is as old as their existence in Europe. Thomaeus, Salmon the English geographer, and lately Signior Grifellini, have endeavoured to prove it by satisfactory evidence. This theory, however, according to our author, is without foundation. The Egyptian descent of these people, he thinks, is not only destitute of proofs, but the most positive evidence is found to contradict it. Their language differs entirely from the Coptic; and their customs are very different from those of the Egyptians. They are indeed to be found in Egypt; but they wander about there as strangers, and form a distinct people, as in other countries. The expressions of Ballonius are strong and decisive: 'No part of the world, I believe, is free from those banditti, wandering about in troops, whom we by mistake call Egyptians and Bohemians.' When we were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of these strolling thieves sitting under palm trees; and they are esteemed foreigners in Egypt as well as among us.'\n\nThe Egyptian descent of the gypsies being rejected, our author next endeavours to show that they come from Hindoostan. The chief basis of his theory, however, is no other than that very dubious one, a similarity of language. He adds a long vocabulary of the gypsy and the Hindoostanic languages; in which, it must be confessed, many words are the same; but many are different. A principal proof which he adduces on this head is from the relation of Captain Szekely von Doba, to whom a printer in 1763 related, that a preacher of the Reformed church, when a student at Leyden, being intimately acquainted with three young Malabar students, took down 1000 of their words, which he fancied corresponded with the gypsy language; and they added, that a tract of land in their illand was named Oxigania. He repeated these words to the Rabb gypsies, who explain them without trouble or hesitation. This account was published in the Vienna Gazette. Supposing these three young men to be sons of Brahmins, who use the Sanscrit, the common language of Hindoostan comes as near to that as modern Italian to pure Latin. The comparison of the two languages takes up above 30 pages; and Mr Grellman thinks it establishes his system. The same opinion is maintained by Mr Marfden, in a paper upon this subject in the 7th volume of the Archeologia. The numerals, however, both in Hindoostanic and gypsy, differ greatly as stated by the two authors. And here, as in other such comparisons, one is astonished at the credulity of the comparers of orthoepy and orthography (as a periodical critic observes), which can have no connection in languages with which we are not perfectly familiar, even were both languages reduced to writing by their respective peoples: how much less, then, where one of the two languages is never reduced to writing, as is the case of the gypsy, but it is blended with the language of the country where the clan resides? This appears from the correspondence of several words in all languages with the gypsy. Mr Grellman acknowledges the two gypsy versions of the Lord's Prayer, at different periods, differ so widely, that one would almost be inclined to doubt whether they were really the same language. We think we can discern a few words differently indeed written, but probably pronounced alike. Nor can we, in all the languages in which Chamberlayne gives the Lord's Prayer, perceive the least resemblance to the gypsy name of father, Dade and Dad, except in the Welsh, Taad. In prosecuting his argument, Mr Grellman does not insist on the similarity of colour between the two peoples, nor on the cowardice common to both, nor on the attachment of the Indians to tents, or letting their children go naked; all these being traits to be met with in other nations: but he dwells on the word Polgar, the name of one of the first gypsy leaders, and of the Hindoostanic god of marriage; also on the correspondence between the travelling smiths in the two peoples, who carry two pair of bellows; the Indian's boy blows them in India, the wife or child of the gypsy in Europe: as if every travelling tinker, in every nation where tinkers travel, had not the same journeymen. In lascivious dances and chiromancy the two peoples agree; nor are these uncommon in other parts of the globe. The excessive loquacity of the two peoples is produced as similar; as if no other nations in the world were loquacious. Fainter resemblances are, a fondness\nGypsies, for saffron, and the intermarrying only with their own people. The last position in the author's theory is, that the gypsies are of the lowest class of Indians, namely, Parias, or, as they are called in Hindostan, Suders. He compares the manners of this class with those of the gypsies, and enumerates many circumstances in which they agree: some of the comparisons are frivolous, and prove nothing. As an instance of which we may take the following: 'Gypsies are fond of being about horses; the Suders in India likewise; for which reason they are commonly employed as horse-keepers by the Europeans resident in that country.' This reasoning does not prove that the gypsies are Suders, any more than that they are Arabians or Yorkshire farmers.\n\nThe objections, however, to which this learned and industrious author's theory is liable, are such as only show it to be by no means satisfactory; but do not prove that it is wrong. It may possibly be right; and upon this supposition the cause of their emigration from their country, he conjectures, not without probability, to be the war of Timur Beg in India. In the years 1408 and 1409 this conqueror ravaged India; and the progress of his arms was attended with devastation and cruelty. All who made resistance were destroyed; those who fell into the enemy's hands were made slaves; of these very slaves 100,000 were put to death. As on this occasion an universal panic took place, what could be more natural than that a great number of terrified inhabitants should endeavour to save themselves by flight?—In the last place, the author endeavours to trace the route by which the gypsies came from Hindostan to Europe; but here he justly acknowledges that all that can be said on the subject is mere surmise; and, upon the whole, after perusing all the preceding details, the reader will probably be of opinion that there still hangs a cloud over the origin of this extraordinary race.\n\nGYPSOPHILA, a genus of plants belonging to the decandria clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 22d order, Caryophyllae.

But nothing can be more ridiculous than to dispute its being a distinct sound, and formed in a particular manner by the organs of speech, at least in our language: witness the words eat and heat, arm and harm, ear and hear, at and hat, &c., as pronounced with or without the h.\n\nIt is pronounced by a strong expiration of the breath between the lips, closing, as it were, by a gentle motion of the lower jaw to the upper, and the tongue nearly approaching the palate.\n\nThere seems to be no doubt, that our h, which is the same with that of the Romans, derived its figure from that of the Hebrew n. And, indeed, the Phoenicians, most ancient Greeks and Romans, used the same figure with our H, which in the series of all these alphabets keeps its primitive place, being the eighth letter.\n\nH, used as a numeral, denotes 200; and with a dash over it, H 200,000.\n\nAs an abbreviation, H was used by the ancients to denote homo, heres, hora, &c.

The name is written in the Hebrew with Habakkuk rath; and signifies \"a wrestler.\" There is no precise time mentioned in Scripture when this Habakkuk lived; but from his predicting the ruin of the Jews by the Chaldeans, it may be concluded that he prophesied before Zedekiah, or about the time of Manasseh. He is reported to have been the author of several prophecies which are not extant; but those that are indubitably his, are contained in three chapters. In these the prophet complains very pathetically of the disorders which he observed in the kingdom of Judaea. God reveals to him, that he would shortly punish them in a very terrible manner by the arms of the Chaldeans. He foretells the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar, his metamorphosis, and death. He foretells, that the vast designs of Jehoiakim would be frustrated. He speaks against a prince (probably the king of Tyre) who built with blood and iniquity; and he accuses another king (perhaps the king of Egypt) of having intoxicated his friend, in order to discover his nakedness. The third chapter is a song or prayer to God, whose majesty he describes with the utmost grandeur and sublimity of expression.\n\nHABAT, a province of Asia, in Barbary, and in the kingdom of Fez.

At that time they light a taper or lamp, with two wicks at least. The matter of the family then takes a cup, with some wine, mixed with fragrant spices, and having repeated a psalm or two of Scripture, as for example, \"I will take the cup of salvation,\" &c. Psal. xxvi. and \"The Jews had light and gladness,\" &c. Eth. viii. he blest the wine and spices. Afterwards he blest the light of the fire; and then casts his eyes on his hands and nails, as remembering that he is going to work. The whole is intended to signify, that the Sabbath is over, and is from that moment divided from the day of labour which follows. For this reason the ceremony is called Habdala, which signifies \"distinction.\" After the ceremony is over, and the company breaks up, they wish one another, not \"a good night,\" but \"a good week.\"\n\nHabeas Corpus, in law, is the great remedy in cases of False Imprisonment. The incapacity of the three other remedies referred to under that article, to give complete relief in every case, hath almost entirely antiquated them, and hath caused a general recourse to be had, in behalf of persons aggrieved by illegal imprisonment, to the present writ, the most celebrated in the English law. Of this there are various kinds made use of by the courts at Westminster, for removing prisoners from one court into another for the more easy administration of justice. Such is the habeas corpus ad respondendum, when a man hath a cause of action against one who is confined by the process of some inferior court; in order to remove the prisoner, and charge him with this new action in the court above. Such is that ad satisfaciendum, when a prisoner hath had judgment against him in an action, and the plaintiff is desirous to bring him up to some superior court to charge him with process of execution. Such also are those ad prosequendum, estificandum, deliberandum, &c.; which issue when it is necessary to remove a prisoner, in order to prosecute or bear testimony in any court, or to be tried in the proper jurisdiction wherein the fact was committed. Such is, lastly, the common writ ad faciendum et recipiendum, which issues out of any of the courts of Westminster-hall, when a person is sued in some inferior jurisdiction, and is desirous to remove the action into the superior court; commanding the inferior judges to produce the body of the defendant, together with the day and cause of his caption and detainer (whence the writ is frequently denominated an habeas corpus cum causa), to do and receive whatsoever the king's court shall confer in that behalf. This is a writ grantable of common right, without any motion in court; and it instantly supercedes all proceedings in the court below. But, in order to prevent the surreptitious discharge of prisoners, it is ordered by statute 1 & 2 P. & M. c. 13, that no habeas corpus shall issue to remove any prisoner out of any goal, unless signed by some judge of the court out of which it is awarded. And, to avoid vexatious delays by removal of frivolous causes, it is enacted by statute 21 Jac. I. c. 23, that, where the judge of an inferior court of record is a barrister of three ears standing, no cause shall be removed from thence by habeas corpus or other writ, after issue or demurrer deliberately joined; that no cause, if once remanded to the inferior court by writ of procedendo or otherwise shall ever afterwards be again removed; and that no habeas corpus shall be removed at all, if the debt or damages laid in the declaration do not amount to the sum of five pounds. But an expedient having been found out to elude the latter branch of the statute, by procuring a nominal plaintiff to bring another action for five pounds or upwards (and then by the course of the court the habeas corpus removed both actions together), it is therefore enacted by statute 1 Geo. I. c. 29, that the inferior court may proceed in such actions as are under the value of five pounds, notwithstanding other actions may be brought against the same defendant to a greater amount.\n\nBut the great and efficacious writ, in all manner of illegal confinement, is that of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum; directed to the person detaining another, and commanding him to produce the body of the prisoner, with the day and cause of his caption and detention, ad faciendum, subjiciendum, et recipiendum, to do, sub. Blackfriars, mit to, and receive whatsoever the judge or court Comment awarding such writ shall confer in that behalf. This is a high prerogative writ, and therefore by the common law issuing out of the court of king's bench, not only in term-time, but also during the vacation, by a fiat from the chief justice, or any other of the judges, and running into all parts of the king's dominions; for the king is at all times intitled to have an account why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted. If it issues in vacation, it is usually returnable before the judge himself who awarded it, and he proceeds by himself thereon; unless the term should intervene, and then it may be returned in court. Indeed, if the party were privileged in the courts of common pleas and exchequer, as being an officer or suitor of the court, an habeas corpus ad subjiciendum might also have been awarded from thence; and, if the cause of imprisonment were palpably illegal, they might have discharged him; but if he were committed for any criminal matter, they could only have remanded him, or taken bail for his appearance in the court of king's bench; which occasioned the common pleas to discountenance such applications. It hath also been said, and by very respectable authorities, that the like habeas corpus may issue out of the court of chancery in vacation: but upon the famous application to Lord Nottingham by Jenks, notwithstanding the most diligent searches, no precedent could be found where the chancellor had issued such a writ in vacation; and therefore his lordship refused it.\n\nIn the court of king's-bench it was, and is still, necessary to apply for it by motion to the court, as in the case of all other prerogative writs (certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, &c.) which do not issue as of mere course, without showing some probable cause why the extraordinary power of the crown is called in to the party's assistance. For, as was argued by Lord chief justice Vaughan, \"it is granted on motion, because it cannot be had of course; and there is therefore no necessity to grant it; for the court ought to be satisfied that the party hath a probable cause to be delivered.\" And this seems the more reasonable, because, when once granted, the person to whom it is directed can return no satisfactory excuse for not bringing up the body of the prisoner. So that, if it\nHAB [210] HAB\n\nissued of mere course, without showing to the court or judge some reasonable ground for awarding it, a traitor or felon under sentence of death, a soldier or mariner in the king's service, a wife, a child, a relation, or a domestic, confined for insanity or other prudential reasons, might obtain a temporary enlargement by suing out an habeas corpus, though sure to be remanded as soon as brought up to the court. And therefore Sir Edward Coke, when chief justice, did not scruple, in 13 Jac. I., to deny a habeas corpus to one confined by the court of admiralty for piracy; there appearing, upon his own showing, sufficient grounds to confine him. On the other hand, if a probable ground be shown, that the party is imprisoned without just cause, and therefore hath a right to be delivered, the writ of habeas corpus is then a writ of right, which \"may not be denied, but ought to be granted to every man that is committed, or detained in prison, or otherwise restrained, though it be by the command of the king, the privy-council, or any other.\"\n\nIn the articles Liberty and Rights, will be found a full discussion of the personal liberty of the subject. This is shown to be a natural inherent right, which could not be surrendered or forfeited unless by the commission of some great and atrocious crime, and which ought not to be abridged in any case without the special permission of law; a doctrine coeval with the first rudiments of our constitution; and handed down to us from the Anglo-Saxons, notwithstanding all their struggles with the Danes, and the violence of the Norman conquest; asserted afterwards and confirmed by the conqueror himself and his descendants; and though sometimes a little impaired by the ferocity of the times, and the occasional despotism of jealous or usurping princes, yet established on the firmest basis by the provisions of magna charta, and a long succession of statutes enacted under Edward III. To assert an absolute exemption from imprisonment in all cases, is inconsistent with every idea of law and political society; and in the end would destroy all civil liberty, by rendering its protection impossible: but the glory of the English law consists in clearly defining the time, the causes, and the extent, when, wherefore, and to what degree, the imprisonment of the subject may be lawful. This it is which induces the absolute necessity of expressing upon every commitment the reason for which it is made: that the court, upon an habeas corpus, may examine into its validity; and according to the circumstances of the case may discharge, admit to bail, or remand the prisoner.\n\nAnd yet, early in the reign of Charles I., the court of king's-bench, relying on some arbitrary precedents (and those perhaps misunderstanding), determined that they could not upon an habeas corpus either bail or deliver a prisoner, though committed without any cause assigned, in case he was committed by the special command of the king, or by the lords of the privy-council. This drew on a parliamentary inquiry, and produced the petition of right, 3 Car. I., which recites this illegal judgment, and enacts that no freeman hereafter shall be so imprisoned or detained. But when, in the following year, Mr Selden and others were committed by the lords of the council, in pursuance of his majesty's special command, under a general charge of \"notable contempts and stirring up sedition against the king and government,\" the judges delayed for two terms (including also the long vacation) to deliver an opinion how far such a charge was bailable; and when at length they agreed that it was, they however annexed a condition of finding sureties for the good behaviour, which still protracted their imprisonment; the chief justice Sir Nicholas Hyde, at the same time declaring, that \"if they were again remanded for that cause, perhaps the court would not afterwards grant a habeas corpus, being already made acquainted with the cause of the imprisonment.\" But this was heard with indignation and astonishment by every lawyer present; according to Mr Selden's own account of the matter, whose resentment was not cooled at the distance of four and twenty years.\n\nThese pitiful evasions gave rise to the statute 16 Car. I. c. 10 §. 8, whereby it is enacted, that if any person be committed by the king himself in person, or by his privy council, or by any of the members thereof, he shall have granted unto him, without any delay, upon any pretence whatsoever, a writ of habeas corpus, upon demand or motion made to the court of king's bench or common pleas; who shall thereupon, within three court days after the return is made, examine and determine the legality of such commitment, and do what to justice shall appertain, in delivering, bailing, or remanding such prisoner. Yet still in the case of Jenks, before alluded to, who in 1676 was committed by the king in council for a turbulent speech at Guildhall, new shifts and devices were made use of to prevent his enlargement by law; the chief justice (as well as the chancellor), declining to award a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum in vacation, though at last he thought proper to award the usual writs ad deliberandum, &c., whereby the prisoner was discharged at the Old Bailey. Other abuses had also crept into daily practice, which had in some measure defeated the benefit of this great constitutional remedy. The party imprisoning was at liberty to delay his obedience to the first writ, and might wait till a second and a third, called an alias and a pluribus, were issued, before he produced the party; and many other vexatious shifts were practised to detain state-prisoners in custody. But whoever will attentively consider the English history, may observe, that the flagrant abuse of any power, by the crown or its ministers, has always been productive of a struggle; which either discovers the exercise of that power to be contrary to law, or (if legal) restrains it for the future. This was the case in the present instance. The opprobrium of an obscure individual gave birth to the famous habeas corpus act, 31 Car. II. c. 2, which is frequently considered as another magna charta of the kingdom; and by consequence has also in subsequent times reduced the method of proceeding on these writs (though not within the reach of that statute, but illusing merely at the common law) to the true standard of law and liberty.\n\nThe statute itself enacts, 1. That the writ shall be returned and the prisoner brought up, within a limited time according to the distance, not exceeding in any case twenty days. 2. That such writs shall be endorsed, as granted in pursuance of this act, and signed by the person awarding them. 3. That on complaint and request.\nHABERDAHER, in commerce, a seller of hats and other small wares.—The master and warden of the company of haberdashers in London, calling to their assistance one of the company of cappers, and another of the hat-makers, and mayors, &c., of towns, may search the wares of all hatters who work hats with foreign wool, and who have not been apprentices to the trade, or who dye them with anything but copperas and galls, or woad and madder; in which cases, they are liable to penalties by stat. 8 Eliz. cap. 7. and 5 Geo. II. cap. 22. See BERDASH.\n\nHABERGION, or HAUBERGEON, HABERGETUM, a coat of mail; an ancient piece of defensive armour, in form of a coat, descending from the neck to the middle, and formed of little iron rings or meshes, linked into each other.—It is also written haberge, hauberge, haubere, haubert, haubert, and hauberk. Spelman takes it from the ancient French haute, \"high,\" and berg, \"armour, covering;\" as serving to defend the upper part of the body. Du Cange and Skinner derive it from the Belgic halz, or Teutonic halz, \"neck,\" and bergem, \"to cover;\" i.e., a defence for the neck. Others will have it formed of al, alla, q.d. all, and bergem, \"to cover;\" as importing it a cover for the whole body. In Scripture it seems to signify an offensive weapon. \"The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold; the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.\" Job. xli. 26.\n\nHABIT, in Philosophy, an aptitude or disposition either of mind or body, acquired by a frequent repetition of the same act. See Custom and Habit.\n\nHabit is also used for a dress or garb, or the composition of garments, wherewith a person is covered. The principal part of the dress worn by the Jews and Greeks was the tunic and the chlamys. The tunic was an upper garment, consisting of a loose square piece of cloth wrapped round the body; the chlamys was an under garment, or tunic, which was fastened round the body and embraced it closely, falling down to the mid-thigh. It is proper in this place to observe that a person divested of this upper garment or tunic, in the eastern language, is styled naked, and in this sense David danced naked before the ark.\n\nThe several sorts of garments in use with both sexes, amongst the Romans, were the toga, tunica, peluma, lacerna, chlamys, paludamentum, laena, stola, pallium or palla. See TOGA, &c.\n\nFor the habits of the priests amongst the Jews, Greeks, and Romans, see the article Priests.\n\nHabit is particularly used for the uniform garments of the religious, conformable to the rules and order whereof\nwhereof they make profession; as the habit of St Benedict, of St Augustine, &c.\n\nIn this sense we say absolutely, such a person has taken the habit; meaning he has entered upon a novitiate in a certain order. So he is said to quit the habit, when he renounces the order. See Vow.\n\nThe habits of the several religious are not supposed to have been calculated for singularity or novelty: the founders of the orders, who were at first chiefly inhabitants of deserts and solitudes, gave their monks the habit usual among the country people. Accordingly, the primitive habits of St Anthony, St Hilarius, St Benedict, &c., are described by the ancient writers as consisting chiefly of sheep skins, the common dress of the peasants, shepherds, and mountaineers of that time; and the same they gave to their disciples.\n\nThe orders established in and about cities and inhabited places took the habit worn by other ecclesiastics at the time of their institution. Thus, St Dominic gave his disciples the habit of regular canons, which he himself had always worn to that time. And the like may be said of the Jesuits, Barnabites, Theatins, Oratorians, &c., who took the common habit of the ecclesiastics at the time of their foundation. And what makes them differ so much from each other, as well as from the ecclesiastical habit of the present times, is, that they have always kept invariably to the same form; whereas the ecclesiastics and laics have been changing their mode on every occasion.\n\nHABITTE and REPUTE, in Scots Law, the common opinion of the people, among whom a person lives, with respect to any circumstance relating to him.\n\nHABITUDE, among schoolmen, the respect or relation one thing bears to another. See RELATION.\n\nHABSBURG, or HAPSBURG, an ancient castle of Switzerland, in the canton of Bern. It is the place where the ancient counts of Hapsburg resided, and is seated near the lake of Lucern, and to the east of the town of that name. E. Long. 8° 10'. N. Lat. 47° 22'.\n\nHACHA, a sea-port town of South America, in Terra Firme, seated at the mouth of a river of the same name. Here the Spanish galleons touch at their arrival in South America, from whence expresses are sent to all the settlements to give them notice of it. W. Long. 72° 8'. N. Lat. 11° 30'.\n\nHACKETT, JOHN, bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, was born in 1592. In 1623 he was made chaplain to James I. and prebendary of Lincoln; and soon after obtained the rectory of St Andrew's Holborn, with that of Cheam in Surry; his patron telling him, he intended Holborn for wealth, and Cheam for health. In 1642 he was presented to a prebendary and residentiary; but was deprived of the enjoyment of them, as well as of St Andrew's, by the ensuing troubles. He then lived retired at Cheam with little disturbance, until he recovered his preferments by the restoration of Charles II., by whom he was preferred to the see of Litchfield and Coventry in 1661. Finding the beautiful cathedral of Litchfield almost battered to the ground, he in eight years finished a complete church superior to the former, at his own expense of £20,000, excepting £1000. He had from the dean and chapter, with what he could procure from private benefactors. He laid out £1000. on a prebendal house, his Hackney, palaces at Litchfield and Eccleshall having been demolished during the civil wars; and beside these acts of munificence, left several other benefactions at his death in 1670. He published, before he entered into orders, a comedy intitled Loyola, which was twice acted before King James I. After his death there appeared a \"Century of his sermons on several remarkable subjects,\" in folio; and \"The life of Archbishop Williams,\" in folio, which was abridged in 1700 by Ambrose Phillips.\n\nHACKNEY, a parish of Middlesex, on the north-east side of London, containing no less than 12 hamlets. At the bottom of Hackney Marsh; through which the river Lea runs, between Old Ford and the Wyck, there have been discovered the remains of a great stone causeway, which, by the Roman coins, &c., found there, was no doubt one of the famous highways made by the Romans. The church here is of a very ancient foundation, so old as Edward II. That part next London is called Mare-street; the middle Church-street; and the north part Clapton; Dorlestone and Shakeswell are on the west, and Hummerton, which leads to the Marsh, on the east. Here are three meeting-houses and several boarding schools, besides the free-school in the churchyard, a charity-school, and 17 almshouses. It was from this place that the coaches let to the people in London first received their name; for in the last century, many people having gone on visits to see their friends at Hackney, it occasioned them often to hire horses or carriages, so that in time it became a common name for such horses, coaches and chairs, as were let to the people of London; and the name has now diffused itself not only throughout Britain, but likewise Ireland.\n\nHackney-Coaches, those exposed to hire in the streets of London, and some other great cities, at rates fixed by authority. See COACH.—These first began to ply in the streets of London, or rather waited at inns, in the year 1625, and were only 20 in number; but in 1635 they were so much increased, that King Charles issued out an order of council for restraining them. In 1637, he allowed 50 hackney-coachmen, each of whom might keep 12 horses. In 1652, their number was limited to 200; and in 1654, it was extended to 300. In 1661, 400 were licensed, at 5l. annually for each. In 1694, 700 were allowed, and taxed by the 5 and 6 of W. and M. at 4l. per annum each. By 9 Anne cap. 23. 800 coaches were allowed in London and Westminster; but by 8 Geo. III. cap. 24. the number is increased to 1000, which are to be licensed by commissioners, and to pay a duty of 5s per week to the king. On Sundays there were formerly only 175 hackney-coaches to ply, which were to be appointed by commissioners; but their number is now unlimited.\n\nThe fare of hackney-coachmen in London, or within ten miles of the city, is 12 shillings and sixpence per day, allowing 12 hours per day. By the hour it is 1s. 6d. for the first, and 1s. for every hour after; and none are obliged to pay above 1s. for any distance not exceeding a mile and a half; or above 1s. 6d. for any distance not exceeding two miles. Where hackney coachmen refuse to go at, or exact more than, their limited hire, they are subject to a forfeit not under...\nHaddington, County of, otherwise called East Lothian, is bounded by Mid Lothian on the west; on the north by the frith of Forth; on the east by the German ocean; and it is separated from the county of Berwick by the Lammermuir hills. It is about 25 miles long, and from 12 to 16 broad, being computed one of the most fertile counties in the kingdom, producing abundance of wheat and every species of grain. Even the mountainous part of it towards the south is admirably adapted to the rearing of sheep. The inhabitants on the sea coasts employ themselves in fishing, making of salt, foreign trade, and the exportation of corn. Several branches of the linen and woollen manufacture have been established in the interior of the county, and are in a flourishing condition. There is a manufacture of sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) established at Prestonpans, and one for sal ammoniac near the same place.\n\nIt contains three royal boroughs, viz. Haddington, North Berwick, and Dunbar; besides a number of well-peopled villages and towns, such as Tranent, Prestonpans, Aberlady, Dirleton, &c. In this county also there are many seats of noblemen and gentlemen, such as those of the duke of Roxburgh, marquis of Tweeddale, earl of Haddington, Lord Blantyre, earl of Wemyss, Lord Elphinstone, earl of Hopetoun, Sir James Hall, Hay of Drummelzier, &c. &c. In this county there is abundance of coal of an excellent quality, of freestone and limestone; ironstone is found in the parish of Humbie, and in the vicinity of Stenton there are some traces of an ore of lead. It is divided into 24 parishes. The population in 1801 amounted to 29,986 souls, and the actual rent of the whole has been estimated at £168,878l. 5s. 10d. sterling. The following table exhibits a view of the population of this county, according to the Statistical History of Scotland.\n\n| Parish          | Population in 1755 | Population in 1790-98 |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Aberlady        | 739               | 820                  |\n| Athelstaneford  | 691               | 927                  |\n| Bolton          | 359               | 235                  |\n| Dirleton        | 1700              | 1200                 |\n| Dunbar          | 3281              | 3700                 |\n| Garvald         | 774               | 730                  |\n| Gladsmuir       | 1415              | 1380                 |\n| Haddington      | 3975              | 3915                 |\n| Humbie          | 1570              | 676                  |\n| Innerwick       | 941               | 960                  |\n\nDecrease, 743\n\nHaddington, a borough-town of Scotland and the capital of East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire, is situated about 16 miles east from Edinburgh, being the first stage on the London road, and in W. Long, 2° 25' N. Lat. 55° 50'. It stands on the river Tyne, has four streets which are neatly built, cutting each other at right angles, with a townhouse erected in 1748, from a design by the celebrated Mr Adams. The school is commodious, with lodgings for the masters, and accommodation for boarders. The parish church is large, which formerly belonged to the Franciscan monastery, and was probably built about the beginning of the 13th century. The west end is now the place of worship, for the rest of it is completely in ruins. The aisle is the burying place of the family of Maitland, and contains several marble statues of the dukes of Lauderdale. On the monument of Maitland of Thirlstane is an epitaph composed by James VI. Haddington is a place of great antiquity, for it is filled by the mother of Malcolm IV. in a charter granted in 1178, meum Burgum de Haddington. Its political constitution is composed of a provost, three bailies, a dean of guild, treasurer, and 12 counsellors. Its incorporated trades are seven in number. It was once strongly fortified, of which different traces are still to be seen.\n\nA considerable manufacture of coarse woollen cloth is carried on in the town and suburbs. It has two annual fairs, and a weekly market on Friday, computed to be the greatest in Scotland for all sorts of grain. Haddington has suffered much from the ravages of fire and the inundations of the Tyne, which rose 17 feet above its usual level in the year 1773, by which one half of the town was laid under water. Here the celebrated John Knox, father of the reformation, is said to have been born, and strangers are still thrown the house where he first drew his breath. It has a vote in electing a member of parliament along with North Berwick, Dunbar, Jedburgh, and Lauder. Its revenue is estimated at about £400l. sterling per annum.\n\nHaddock, the English name of a species of Gadus. See Gadus, Ichthyology Index.\n\nHadersleben, a sea-port town of Denmark, in\nin the duchy of Sleswig, with a strong citadel, built upon a small island.

See MEDICINE and SURGERY Index.\n\nHÆMORRHOIDAL, an appellation given by anatomists to the arteries and veins going to the intestine rectum.\n\nHÆMORRHOIDS, or Piles, an hemorrhage or issue of blood from the hemorrhoidal vessels.

This writ Harlem is thought by some to be as ancient as the common law itself; however, the conviction of heresy by the common law was not in any petty ecclesiastical court, but before the archbishop himself in a provincial synod, and the delinquent was delivered up to the king to do with him as he pleased: so that the crown had a control over the spiritual power. But by 2 Hen. IV. cap. 15. the diocesan alone, without the intervention of a synod, might convict of heretical tenets; and unless the convict abjured his opinions, or if after abjuration he relapsed, the sheriff was bound ex officio, if required by the bishop, to commit the unhappy victim to the flames, without waiting for the consent of the crown. This writ remained in force, and was actually executed on two Anabaptists in the seventh of Elizabeth, and on two Arians in the ninth of James I.—Sir Edward Coke was of opinion, that this writ did not lie in his time: but it is now formally taken away by statute 29 Car. II. cap. 9. But this statute does not extend to take away or abridge the jurisdiction of Protestant archbishops or bishops, or any other judges of any ecclesiastical courts, in cases of atheism, blasphemy, heresy, or schism, and other damnable doctrines and opinions; but they may prove and punish the same according to his majesty's ecclesiastical laws, by excommunication, deprivation, degradation, and other ecclesiastical censures, not extending to death, in such fort and no other, as they might have done before the making of this act, sec. 2.

They are called also Ishmaelites and Saracens: and lastly, by the general name of Arabians.\n\nAs to the Hagarens, they dwelt in Arabia the Happy, according to Pliny. Strabo joins them with the Nabathaeans, and Chavilteans, whose habitation was rather in Arabia Deserta. Others think their capital was Petra, otherwise Agra, and consequently they should be placed in Arabia Petraea. The author of the lxxxiii. Psalm, ver. 6. joins them with the Moabites; and in the Chronicles it is said (1 Chr. v. 10.), that the sons of Reuben, in the time of Saul, made war against the Hagarens, and became masters of their country eastward of the mountains of Gilead. This therefore was the true and ancient country of the Hagarens. When Trajan came into Arabia, he besieged the capital of the Hagarens, but could not take it. The sons of Hagar valued themselves of old upon their wisdom, as appears by Baruch iii. 23.\n\nHAGENAU, a town of Germany, and capital of a bailiwick of the same name, which was formerly imperial, but now belongs to the French. It was taken by them in 1673; the Imperialists retook it in 1702; after which it was several times taken and retaken by both parties; but at last the French got possession of it in 1756. It is divided by the river Motter into two parts; and is seated near a forest of its own name, in E. Long. 7° 53'. N. Lat. 48° 49'.\n\nHAGGAI, the tenth of the small prophets, was born, in all probability, at Babylon, in the year of the world 3457, from whence he returned with Zerubbabel. It was this prophet who by command from God (Ezra v. 1, 2, &c.) exhorted the Jews, after their re-\nturn from the captivity, to finish the rebuilding of the temple, which they had intermitted for 14 years. His remonstrances had their effect; and to encourage them to proceed in the work, he assured them from God, that the glory of this latter house should be greater than the glory of the former house; which was accordingly fulfilled, when Christ honoured it with his presence: for with respect to the building, this latter temple was nothing in comparison of the former.\n\nWe know nothing certain of Haggai's death. The Jews pretend, that he died in the last year of the reign of Darius, at the same time with the prophets Zechariah and Malachi, and that thereupon the spirit of prophecy ceased among the children of Israel. Epiphanius will have it, that he was buried at Jerusalem among the priests. The Greeks keep his festival on the 16th of December, and the Latins on the 4th of July.\n\nHAGIOGRAPHA, a name given to part of the books of Scripture, called by the Jews Cetuvim. The word is compounded of אָנְיֵי \"holy;\" and יְרִיעַ \"I write.\" The name is very ancient: St Jerome makes frequent mention of it: before him, St Epiphanius called these books simply יְרִיעַ.\n\nThe Jews divide the sacred writings into three classes: The Law, which comprehends the five books of Moses; the Prophets, which they call Neviim; And the Cetuvim, called by the Greeks, &c. Hagiographa; comprehending the books of Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Daniel, Ezra, including also the books of Nehemiah, Chronicles, Canticles, Ruth, the Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther.\n\nThe Jews sometimes call the books the Writings, by way of eminence, as being written by immediate inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Thus says Kimchi, in his preface to the Psalms, Maimonides in More Nevoh, and Elias Levita in his Thibb, under the word מִשְׁנֶה.\n\nThey distinguish the hagiographers, however, from the prophets; in that the authors of the former did not receive the matters contained in them by the way called Prophecy, which consists in dreams, visions, whisperings, ecclaties, &c. but by mere inspiration and direction of the Spirit.\n\nHAGUE, a town of the United Provinces, in Holland, situated in E. Long. 4° 10'. N. Lat. 48° 49'.—In Latin it is called Haga Comitis; in French, La Haye; in Dutch, der Haag, or 'S-Graavenhage, i.e. the Earl's Grove or Wood, from the wood near which it is built, and in which the earls of Holland had a country-house. Though it sends no deputies to the States, it is one of the most considerable towns in Holland, pleasantly situated, and exceeding beautiful. It may indeed compare with almost any city in Europe, though geographers account it but a village. The inhabitants also breathe a better air than those of the other cities, as it stands on a dry soil, somewhat higher than the rest of the country. It has no gates or walls, but is surrounded by a moat over which there are many draw-bridges. Two hours are required to walk round it, and it contains about 40,000 or 50,000 souls. It is a place of much splendor and balm, being the seat of the high colleges of the republic and province of Holland, and the residence of the stadtholder and foreign ambassadors; and there are a great many fine streets and squares in it. In the Hague, inner court, all the high colleges and courts of justice hold their assemblies; there also the foot-guards do duty, as the horse-guards in the outer, when the states are sitting. De Plaats is an open airy place, in form of a triangle, adorned with neat and beautiful buildings: the Vyverbeg is an eminence, laid out into several fine shady walks, with the Vyver, a large basin of water, at the bottom: the Voorhout is the most celebrated part of the Hague, and consists of the mall, and three ways for coaches on each side, planted with trees, being much the same as St James's park at London: the palace of Opdam, or Wassenaar, is built in a very elegant taste: the Prince and Princess Grafs are fine streets: the Plan, in Dutch Het Pleyn, is a beautiful grove, laid out in several crois walks, and surrounded with stately houses. The Jewish synagogue is well worth being seen by a curious traveller; and also the palaces of the prince of Orange, the hotel of Spain, the new Woorhout, the mausoleum of the baron of Opdam in the great church, and the several hospitals. The environs of the Hague are exceedingly pleasant. Among other agreeable objects are the wood, with the palace of Orange at the extremity of it, called the house in the wood; the village of Scheveling; and the sand-hills along the north sea; with the village of Voorburg, and the charming seats and fine gardens round it. Two miles from the Hague is Ryfwick, a village: and, a quarter of a mile from that, a noble palace formerly belonging to the prince of Orange, famous for the treaty of peace concluded there in 1607. Loofduyuen, where Margaret, countess of Henneburg, and daughter of Florence IV. count of Holland and Zealand, is said to have been delivered of 365 children at a birth in 1276, is about five miles from the Hague. Five miles beyond Loofduyuen, and not far from the beautiful village of Gravelande, is Honlardyck, another palace belonging to the prince of Orange, and one of the finest structures in the Low Countries.\n\nHAI-NAN. See HAINAN.\n\nHai-Tang, a beautiful Chinese shrub, originally brought from the bottom of the rocks which border the sea-coast. It has been cultivated in China for more than 14 centuries; and is celebrated as often in the works of the Chinese poets, as roses and lilies are in those of ours. Painters and embroiderers ornament almost all their works with its foliage and flowers. The stalk of the hai-tang is of a cylindrical form, and shoots forth a number of branches of a purple tint towards their bases, and full of knots, which are all of a purple colour round the edges. It produces a number of shoots, the tallest of which are about two feet and a half in height. Its leaves (which are much indented, of an oval form towards the stalk, pointed at their upper extremities, and full of small prickles) grow almost opposite one another on the branches, and at the same distance as the knots. Their colour above is a deep-green; that below is much lighter, and almost effaced by their fibres, which are large, and of a delicate purple: all these leaves together have a beautiful effect to the eye. The flowers grow in bunches at the extremities of the branches. Each flower is composed of four petals, two great and two small, resembling in colour, the bloom of a peach-tree, and which...\nwhich have almost the same figure as the blossom of our cherry-trees. The two large are cemented one upon the other, in the form of a purse; and when they blow, the two small blow also in their turn; and then the whole four represent a cross. The pistil is composed of very bright yellow grains, which separate gradually one from another by the lengthening of the filaments to which they adhere; they then open into little bells, and compose a small yellow tuft, supported by a slender stalk, which rises above the petals. The calyx, which sustains each of the flowers, is composed of two purple-coloured leaves, united in form of a purse. In proportion as the flowers grow and increase in size, the two leaves of the calyx open, become pale and dry, and drop off. The flowers, supported by small stalks, separate one from the other, and produce of themselves other flowers, which rise up from a new calyx.\n\nThis plant is propagated from seed, but with difficulty. It thrives best in a sandy soil; dung or mould destroy it; and great care must be taken to refresh it only with the purest water. As it cannot endure the sun in any season, it is always planted below walls that are exposed to the north. It generally begins to flower about the end of August. After it has produced seed, all its branches are cut; and it commonly shoots forth new ones before the spring following; but it is necessary to heap up gravel and pieces of bricks round its roots, to prevent them from rotting. Notwithstanding all the care that is taken to cultivate this tree at Peking, it does not thrive so well there as in the southern provinces. The smell of its leaves has an affinity both to that of the rose and the violet; but it is weaker, and never extends to any great distance.\n\nHAIL, in Natural History, a meteor generally defined frozen rain, but differing from it in that the hailstones are not formed of single pieces of ice, but of many little spherules agglutinated together. Neither are these spherules all of the same consistence; some of them being hard and solid like perfect ice; others soft, and mottled like snow hardened by a severe frost. Sometimes the hailstone hath a kind of core of this soft matter; but more frequently the core is solid and hard, while the outside is formed of a softer matter. Hailstones assume various figures, being sometimes round, at other times pyramidal, crenated, angular, thin, and flat, and sometimes stellated, with six radii like the small crystals of snow.\n\nNatural historians furnish us with various accounts of surprising showers of hail, in which the hailstones were of extraordinary magnitude. Mezeray, speaking of the war of Louis XII. in Italy, in the year 1510, relates, that there was for some time an horrible darkness, thicker than that of night; after which the clouds broke into thunder and lightning, and there fell a shower of hailstones, or rather (as he calls them) pebble-stones, which destroyed all the fish, birds, and beasts of the country.—It was attended with a strong smell of sulphur; and the stones were of a bluish colour, some of them weighing a hundred pounds. Hist. de France, tom. ii. p. 339.\n\nAt Lille in Flanders, in 1686, fell hailstones of a very large size; some of which contained in the middle a dark brown matter, which, thrown on the fire, gave a very great report. Phil. Trans. No. 223.\n\nDr Halley and others also relate, that in Cheshire, Lancashire, &c. April 29. 1697, a thick black cloud, coming from Caernarvonshire, diffused the vapours to congeal in such a manner, that for about the breadth of two miles which was the limit of the cloud, in its progress for the space of 60 miles, it did inconceivable damage; not only killing all sorts of fowls and other small animals, but splitting trees, knocking down horses and men, and even ploughing up the earth; so that the hailstones buried themselves under ground an inch or an inch and a half deep. The hailstones, many of which weighed five ounces, and some half a pound, and being five or six inches about, were of various figures; some round, others half round; some smooth, others embossed and crenated; the icy substance of them was very transparent and hard, but there was a snowy kernel in the middle of them.\n\nIn Hertfordshire, May 4. the same year, after a severe storm of thunder and lightning, a shower of hail succeeded, which far exceeded the former: some persons were killed by it, their bodies beat all black and blue; vast oaks were split, and fields of rye cut down as with a scythe. The stones measured from 10 to 13 or 14 inches about. Their figures were various, some oval, others picked, some flat. Philosoph. Trans. No. 229. See Meteorology Index.\n\nHAILING, the salutation or accosting of a ship at a distance, either at sea, or in a harbour. The usual expression is, \"Hoa, the ship ahoy!\" To which the answerers, \"Holloa? Whence came ye?\" Where are ye bound? Good voyage! What cheer? All well! How fare ye?\" &c.\n\nHALMSUCKEN. See HAMESECKEN.\n\nHAINAN, a considerable island of Asia, situated between 18° and 25° N. Lat. It is subject to China, and belongs to the province of Quang-ton. It has on the north the province of Quang-hi; on the south the channel formed between the bank Paracel and the eastern coast of Cochin-China; on the west, the same kingdom and part of Tong-king; and on the east, the Chinese sea. Its extent from east to west is between 60 and 70 leagues, and from north to south 45; this island therefore is about 160 leagues in circumference. Kian-tehceou-fou, its capital, stands on a promontory, and ships often anchor at the bottom of its walls. Two different kinds of mandarins command here, as in all the other provinces of China: the first are called literati; the second, mandarins of arms, or military officers. Its jurisdiction extends over three cities of the second class and ten of the third. The greater part of the island is under the dominion of the emperor of China; the rest is independent, and inhabited by a free people, who have never yet been subdued. Compelled to abandon their plains and fields to the Chinese, they have retreated to the mountains in the centre of the island, where they are sheltered from the insults of their neighbours.\n\nThese people formerly had a free and open correspondence with the Chinese. Twice a year they exposed, in an appointed place, the gold which they dug from their mines, with their eagle-wood and calamba, so much esteemed by the Orientals. A deputy was sent\nHainan, sent to the frontiers, to examine the cloths and other commodities of the Chinese, whose principal traders repaired to the place of exchange fixed on; and after the Chinese wares were delivered, they put into their hands with the greatest fidelity what they had agreed for. The Chinese governors made immense profits by this barter.\n\nThe emperor Kang-hi, informed of the prodigious quantity of gold which passed through the hands of the mandarins by this traffic, forbade his subjects, under pain of death, to have any communication with these islanders; however, some private emigrants of the neighbouring governors still find the means of having intercourse with them; but what they get at present by this clandestine trade is little, in comparison of that which they gained formerly. The natives of this island are very deformed, small of stature, and of a copper colour: both men and women wear their hair thrust through a ring on their forehead; and above they have a small straw-hat, from which hang two strings that are tied under the chin. Their dress consists of a piece of black or dark-blue cotton cloth, which reaches from the girdle to their knees: the women have a kind of robe of the same stuff, and mark their faces from the eyes to the chin with blue stripes made with indigo.\n\nAmong the animals of this island are a curious species of large black apes, which have the shape and features of a man; they are said to be very fond of women: there are also found here crows with a white ring round their necks; starlings which have a small crescent on their bills; blackbirds of a deep blue colour, with yellow ears rising half an inch; and a multitude of other birds, remarkable for their colour or song. Besides mines of gold and lapis lazuli, which enrich the island of Hainan, it produces in abundance various kinds of curious and valuable wood. The predecessor of the present emperor caused some of it to be transported to Peking, at an immense expense, to adorn an edifice which he intended for a mausoleum. The most valuable is called by the natives huali; and by the Europeans rose or violet wood from its smell; it is very durable, and of a beauty which nothing can equal; it is therefore reserved for the use of the emperor.\n\nHainan, on account of its situation, riches, and extent, deserves to be ranked among the most considerable islands of Asia. Not far from thence is another small island, commonly called San-cian. It is celebrated by the death of St Francis Xavier: his tomb is still to be seen on a small hill, at the bottom of which is a plain covered on one side with wood, and on the other ornamented with several gardens. This island is not a desert, as some travellers have pretended: it contains five villages; the inhabitants of which are poor people, who have nothing to subsist on but rice and the fish which they catch.\n\nHAINAULT, a province of the Netherlands, belonging partly to France and partly to the house of Austria. It is bounded to the south by Champagne and Picardy; to the north by Flanders; to the east by the duchy of Brabant, the county of Namur, and the bishopric of Liege; and to the west by Artois and Flanders. Its extent from north to south is about 45 miles, and about 48 from east to west. The air is pleasant and temperate, and the soil fruitful: it abounds in rich pastures, corn-fields, woods and forests, coal, iron, lead, beautiful marble, flate, and other useful stones: it is well watered by rivers and lakes, and breeds abundance of black cattle, and sheep whose wool is very fine. Its principal rivers are the Scheldt, the Selle, and the Dender. This province is reckoned to contain 24 walled towns, 950 villages, one duchy, and several principalities, earldoms, peerdoms, and baronies. The abbeys in it are 27. For spiritual matters, the greater part of it is subject to the archbishop of Cambrai, and the rest to the bishops of Liege and Arras. The states of the province consist of the clergy, nobility, and commoners. The clergy are the abbots, deputies of the chapters, and rural deans; but the chapters of St Waudru and St Germain, in Mons, send no deputies, as they contribute nothing to the public taxes. The nobility consist of the earls and barons, and all those who by their birth have a right to a seat in the assembly of the states. The commoners are composed of the deputies of the towns. The clergy in this county are uncommonly rich. The states meet only when they are summoned by the sovereign; but there is a standing committee at Mons which meets weekly. This county had counts of its own, till the year 1436; when Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, arrived to the possession of it, upon the death of Jacqueline, the heiress, without issue. The French acquired that part of it which they possessed, partly by the peace of the Pyrenees, and partly by those of Nimeguen and Ryfwick. The arms of this county are quartered, and contain four lions, in a field or. It was formerly governed by a sovereign council, at the head of which was the high bailiff, who had very great authority; he represented the sovereign, was governor of Mons, and captain-general of the province.\n\nHAIR, small filaments issuing out of the pores of the skins of animals; and serving most of them as a tegument or covering*. In lieu of hair, the naked* See An- nals of some animals is covered with feathers, wool, scales, &c.\n\nHair is found on all parts of the human body, except the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands.—But it grows longest on the head, chin, breast, in the armpits, and about the privities.\n\nThe ancients held the hair a sort of excrement, fed only with excrementitious matters, and no proper part of a living body.—They supposed it generated of the fuliginous parts of the blood, exhaled by the heat of the body to the surface, and there condensed in passing through the pores.—Their chief reasons were, that the hair being cut, will grow again apace, even in extreme old age, and when life is very low: that in hectic and consumptive people, where the rest of the body is continually emaciating and attenuating, the hair shall thrive: nay, and that it will grow again in dead carcasses.—They added, that hair does not feed and grow like the other parts, by introfusception, i.e. by a juice circulating within it; but, like the nails, by juxtaposition, each part next the root thrusting forward that immediately before it.\n\nBut the moderns are agreed, that every hair does properly and truly live, and receive nutriment to fill and defend it like the other parts; which they argue hence\nhence, that the roots do not turn gray in aged persons sooner than the extremities, but the whole changes colour at once, and the like is observed in boys, &c.; which shows that there is a direct communication, and that all the parts are affected alike.\n\nIt may be observed, however, that, in propriety, the life and growth of hairs is of a different kind from that of the rest of the body; and is not immediately derived therefrom, or reciprocated therewith. It is rather of the nature of vegetation. They grow as plants do out of the earth; or, as some plants shoot from the parts of others; from which though they draw their nourishment, yet each has, as it were, its several life and a distinct economy. They derive their food from some juices in the body, but not from the nutritious juices; whence they may live though the body be starved.—Wulferus, in the Philosophical Collections, gives an account of a woman buried at Nurnberg, whose grave being opened forty-three years after her death, there was hair found issuing forth plentifully through the clefts of the coffin; inomuch, that there was reason to imagine the coffin had some time been covered all over with hair. The cover being removed, the whole corps appeared in its perfect shape; but, from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot, covered over with a thick-set hair, long and curled. The sexton going to handle the upper part of the head with his fingers, the whole structure fell at once, leaving nothing in his hand but an handful of hair; there was neither skull nor any other bone left; yet the hair was solid and strong enough.—Mr Arnold, in the same collection, gives a relation of a man hanged for theft, who in a little time, while he yet hung upon the gallows, had his body strangely covered over with hair.—Some moderns, however, deny the authenticity of these and other similar instances.\n\nThe hairs ordinarily appear round or cylindrical; but the microscope also discovers triangular and square ones; which diversity of figure arises from that of the pores, to which the hairs always accommodate themselves. Their length depends on the quantity of the proper humour to feed them, and their colour on the quality of that humour: whence, at different stages of life, the colour usually differs. Their extremities split into two or three branches, especially when kept dry, or suffered to grow too long; so that what appears only a single hair to the naked eye, seems a brush to the microscope.\n\nThe hair of a mouse, viewed by Mr Derham with a microscope, seemed to be one single transparent tube, with a pith made up of fibrous substances, running in dark lines, in some hairs transversely, in others spirally. The darker medullary parts or lines, he observes, were no other than small fibres convolved round, and lying closer together than in the other parts of the hair. They run from the bottom to the top of the hair, and he imagines, may serve to make a gentle evacuation of some humour out of the body. Hence the hair of hairy animals, this author suggests, may not only serve as a fence against cold, &c., but as an organ of insensible perspiration.\n\nThough the external surface of the body is the natural place of hairs, we have many well-attested instances of their being found also on the internal surface. Amatus Lusitanus mentions a person who had hair upon his tongue. Pliny and Valerius Maximus concur in their testimonies, that the heart of Ariftomenes the Messenian was hairy. Cælius Rhodiginus relates the same of Hermogenes the rhetorician; and Plutarch, of Leonidas the Spartan.—Hairs are said to have been frequently found in the breasts of women, and to have occasioned the distemper called trichiasis; but some authors are of opinion, that these are small worms and not hairs. There have been, however, various and indisputable observations of hairs found in the kidneys, and voided by urine.\n\nHippocrates is of opinion, that the glandular parts are the most subject to hair; but bundles of hair have been found in the muscular parts of beef, and in such parts of the human body as are equally firm with that.\n\nHair has been often found in ableseeds and impotibilities. Schultetus, opening the abdomen of a woman, found 12 pints of water, and a large lock or bundle of hair swimming loose in it. But of all the internal parts, there is none so much subject to an unnatural growth of hair as the ovaries of females, and that as well of the human species as of other animals. Of this Dr Tyson relates three remarkable instances; two of these were young women, and the other was a bitch. The animal had been much emaciated in its hinder parts; the hair was about an inch and an half long; but the most remarkable particular was, that hair was also found lying loose in the cavities of the veins. We have several instances of mankind being affected in the same manner. Cardan relates, that he found hair in the blood of a Spaniard; and Sionatius in that of a gentlewoman of Cracovia; and Schultetus declares from his own observation, that those people who are afflicted with the plica polonica, have very often hair in their blood.\n\nDiseases of the Hair. Almost the only disease of the hair, besides the remarkable one called plica polonica, is its falling off, or baldness. For this many remedies have been recommended, but scarce any of them can be depended upon. The juice of burdock, and the lixivial salts of vine ashes, are said to be efficacious; also the powder of hemodactyls, and the decoction of boxwood. A remarkable instance of the efficacy of this last is given under the article Buxus.—Some authors give instances of the hair changing its colour in a short time, through grief, or by reason of a fright, &c.\n\nHair as an Ornament, or as an Ensign of Dignity or of Religion. By the Jews hair was worn naturally long, just as it grew; but the priests had theirs cut every fortnight, while they were in waiting at the temple; they made use of no razors, however, but scissors only. The Nazarites, while their vow continued, were forbidden to touch their heads with a razor. See Nazarite.\n\nThe falling of the hair, or a change of its colour, was regarded amongst the Hebrews as a sign of the leprosy. Black hair was esteemed by them as the most beautiful. Absalom's hair was cut once a-year, and is said to have weighed 200 shekels, by the king's weight, which is about 31 ounces. The law of God hath left no particular ordinances with respect to the hair.\n\nThe hair of both Jewish and Grecian women engaged a principal share of their attention, and the Roman ladies\nladies seem to have been no less curious with respect to theirs. They generally wore it long, and dressed it in a variety of ways, ornamenting it with gold, silver, pearls, &c. On the contrary, the men amongst the Greeks and Romans, and amongst the later Jews, wore their hair short, as may be collected from books, medals, statues, &c. This formed a principal distinction in dress betwixt the sexes. This observation illustrates a passage in St Paul's epistle to the Corinthians (1 Cor. xi. 14-15.)\n\nSt Paul forbids the Corinthian women, when praying by divine inspiration, to have their hair dishevelled; probably because this made them resemble the heathen priestesses, when actuated by the pretended influence of their gods.\n\nAmongst the Greeks, both sexes, a few days before marriage, cut off and consecrated their hair as an offering to their favourite deities. It was also customary among them to hang the hair of the dead on the doors of their houses previous to interment. They likewise tore, cut off, and sometimes shaved their hair, when mourning for their deceased relations or friends, which they laid upon the corpse or threw into the pile, to be consumed together with the body. The ancients imagined that no person could die till a lock of hair was cut off; and this act they supposed was performed by the invisible hand of death, or Iris, or some other messenger of the gods. This hair, thus cut off, they fancied consecrated the person to the infernal deities, under whose jurisdiction the dead were supposed to be. It was a sort of first fruits which sanctified the whole. (See Virg. Aen. iv. 694.)\n\nWhatever was the fashion with respect to the hair, in the Grecian states, slaves were forbidden to imitate the freemen. The hair of the slaves was always cut in a particular manner, called ἐπικεφαλοποιημένος, which they no longer retained after they procured their freedom.\n\nIt was esteemed a notable honour among the ancient Gauls to have long hair, and hence came the appellation Gallia Comata. For this reason Julius Caesar, upon subduing the Gauls, made them cut off their hair as a token of submission.—It was with a view to this, that such as afterwards quitted the world to go and live in cloisters, procured their hair to be shaven off; to show that they bade adieu to all earthly ornaments, and made a vow of perpetual subjection to their superiors.\n\nGreg. of Tours affirms us, that in the royal family of France, it was a long time the peculiar mark and privilege of kings and princes of the blood to wear long hair, artfully dressed and curled: every body else was obliged to be polled, or cut round, in sign of inferiority and obedience. Some writers assure us, that there were different cuts for all the different qualities and conditions; from the prince who wore it at full length, to the slave or villain who was quite cropped.—To cut off the hair of a son of France, under the first race of kings, was to declare him excluded from the right of succeeding to the crown, and reduced to the condition of a subject.\n\nIn the eighth century, it was the custom of people of quality to have their children's hair cut the first time by persons they had a particular honour and esteem for; who, in virtue of this ceremony, were reputed a sort of spiritual parents or godfathers thereof: Though this practice appears to have been more ancient; inasmuch as we read, that Constantine sent the pope the hair of his son Heraclius, as a token that he desired him to be his adoptive father.\n\nThe parade of long hair became still more and more obnoxious in the progress of Christianity, as something utterly inconsistent with the profession of persons who bore the cross. Hence numerous injunctions and canons to the contrary. Pope Anicetus is commonly supposed to have been the first who forbade the clergy to wear long hair; but the prohibition is of an older standing in the churches of the east; and the letter wherein that decree is written, is of a much later date than that pope.—The clerical tonsure is related by Isidore Hispalensis, as of apostolical institution.\n\nLong hair was anciently held so odious, that there is a canon still extant of the year 1096, importing, that such as wore long hair should be excluded coming into church while living, and not be prayed for when dead. We have a furious declamation of Luitprand against the emperor Phocas, for wearing long hair, after the manner of the other emperors of the east, all except Theophilus, who being bald, enjoined all his subjects to shave their heads.\n\nThe French historians and antiquaries have been very exact in recording the head of hair of their several kings. Charlemagne wore it very short, his son shorter; Charles the bald had none at all. Under Hugh Capet it began to appear again: this the ecclesiastics took in dudgeon, and excommunicated all who let their hair grow. Peter Lombard expostulated the matter so warmly with Charles the Young, that he cut off his hair; and his successors for some generations wore it very short.—A professor of Utrecht, in 1650, wrote expressly on the question, Whether it be lawful for men to wear long hair? and concluded for the negative.—Another divine, named Reves, who had written for the affirmative, replied to him.\n\nThe ancient Britons were extremely proud of the length and beauty of their hair, and were at much pains in dressing and adorning their heads. Some of them carried their fondness for and admiration of their hair to an extravagant height. It is said to have been the last and most earnest request of a young warrior, who was taken prisoner and condemned to be beheaded, that no slave might be permitted to touch his hair, which was remarkably long and beautiful, and that it might not be stained with his blood. We hardly ever meet with a description of a fine woman or beautiful man, in the poems of Ossian, but their hair is mentioned as one of their greatest beauties. Not contented with the natural colour of their hair, which was commonly fair or yellow, they made use of certain washes to render it still brighter. One of these washes was a composition of lime, the ashes of certain vegetables, and tallow. They made use of various arts also to make the hair of their heads grow thick and long; which last was not only esteemed a great beauty, but was considered as a mark of dignity and noble birth. Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, is described by Dio with very long hair, flowing over her shoulders, and reaching down below the middle of her back. The Britons\nshaved all their beards, except their upper lips; the hair of which they, as well as the Gauls, allowed to grow to a very inconvenient length.\n\nIn after-times, the Anglo-Saxons and Danes also considered fine hair as one of the greatest beauties and ornaments of their persons, and were at no little pains in dressing it to advantage. Young ladies before marriage wore their hair uncovered and untied, flowing in ringlets over their shoulders; but as soon as they were married, they cut it shorter, tied it up, and put on a head-dress of some kind or other according to the prevailing fashion. To have the hair entirely cut off was so great a disgrace, that it was one of the greatest punishments inflicted on those women who were guilty of adultery. The Danish soldiers who were quartered upon the English, in the reigns of Edgar the Peaceable and of Ethelred the Unready, were the beaux of those times, and were particularly attentive to the dressing of their hair; which they combed at least once every day, and thereby captivated the affections of the English ladies. The clergy, both secular and regular, were obliged to shave the crowns of their heads, and keep their hair short, which distinguished them from the laity; and several canons were made against their concealing their tonsure, or allowing their hair to grow long. The shape of this clerical tonsure was the subject of long and violent debates between the English clergy on the one hand, and those of the Scots and Picts on the other; that of the former being circular, and that of the latter only semicircular. It appears very plainly, that long flowing hair was universally esteemed a great ornament; and the tonsure of the clergy was considered as an act of mortification and self-denial, to which many of them submitted with reluctance, and endeavoured to conceal as much as possible. Some of them who affected the reputation of superior sanctity inveighed with great bitterness against the long hair of the laity; and laboured earnestly to persuade them to cut it short, in imitation of the clergy. Thus the famous St Wulstan bishop of Worcester, is said to have declaimed with great vehemence against luxury of all kinds, but chiefly against long hair as most criminal and most universal. \"The English (says William of Malmesbury in his life of St Wulstan) were very vicious in their manners, and plunged in luxury, through the long peace which they had enjoyed in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The holy prelate Wulstan reproved the wicked of all ranks with great boldness; but he rebuked those with the greatest severity who were proud of their long hair. When any of those vain people bowed their heads before him to receive his blessing, before he gave it, he cut a lock of their hair with a little sharp knife, which he carried about him for that purpose; and commanded them, by way of penance for their sins, to cut all the rest of their hair in the same manner. If any of them refused to comply with this command, he denounced the most dreadful judgments upon them, reproached them for their effeminacy, and foretold, that as they imitated women in the length of their hair, they would imitate them in their cowardice when their country was invaded; which was accomplished at the landing of the Normans.\"\n\nThis continued to be long a topic of declamation among the clergy, who even represented it as one of the greatest crimes, and most certain marks of reprobation. Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, went so far as to pronounce the then terrible sentence of excommunication against all who wore long hair, for which pious zeal he is very much commended. Serlo, a Norman bishop, acquired great honour by a sermon which he preached before Henry I. A.D. 1104, against long and curled hair, with which the king and all his courtiers were so much affected, that they consented to resign their flowing ringlets, of which they had been so vain. The prudent prelate gave them no time to change their minds, but immediately pulled a pair of shears out of his sleeve, and performed the operation with his own hand. Another incident happened about 25 years after, which gave a temporary check to the prevailing fondness for long hair. It is thus related by a contemporary historian: \"An event happened, A.D. 1129, which seemed very wonderful to our young gallants; who, forgetting that they were men, had transformed themselves into women by the length of their hair. A certain knight, who was very proud of his long luxuriant hair, dreamed that a person hallucinated him with its curls. As soon as he awoke from his sleep, he cut his hair to a decent length. The report of this spread over all England, and almost all the knights reduced their hair to the proper standard. But this reformation was not of long continuance; for in less than a year all who wished to appear fashionable returned to their former wickedness, and contended with the ladies in length of hair. Those to whom nature had denied that ornament supplied the defect by art.\n\nThe Greeks, and, after their example, the Romans, wore false hair.\n\nCommerce of Hair. Hair makes a very considerable article in commerce, especially since the mode of periwigs has obtained. The hair of the growth of the northern countries, as England, &c. is valued much beyond that of the more southern ones, as Italy, Spain, the south parts of France, &c. The merit of good hair consists in its being well fed, and neither too coarse nor too slender; the bigness rendering it less susceptible of the artificial curl, and disposing it rather to frizzle, and the smallness making its curl of too short duration. Its length should be about 25 inches; the more it falls short of this, the less value it bears.\n\nThere is no certain price for hair; but it is sold from five shillings to five pounds an ounce, according to its quality.\n\nThe scarcity of gray and white hair has put the dealers in that commodity upon the methods of reducing other colours to this. This is done by spreading the hair to bleach on the grass like linen, after first washing it out in a lixivious water. This dye, with the force of the sun and air, brings the hair to so perfect a whiteness, that the most experienced person may be deceived therein; there being scarce any way of detecting the artifice, but by boiling and drying it, which leaves the hair of the colour of a dead walnut-tree leaf.\n\nThere is also a method of dyeing hair with bismuth, which renders such white hair as borders too much upon the yellow of a bright silver colour: boiling is the proof of this too, the bismuth not being able to stand it.\nHair may be also changed from a red, gray, or other disagreeable colour, to a brown or deep black, by a solution of silver. The liquors sold under the name of hair-waters, are at bottom no more than solutions of silver in aquafortis, largely diluted with water, with the addition perhaps of other ingredients, which contribute nothing to their efficacy. The solution should be fully saturated with the silver, that there may be no more acid in it than is necessary for holding the metal dissolved; and besides dilution with water, a little spirit of wine may be added for the further dulcification of the acid. It must be observed, that for diluting the solution, distilled water, or pure rain-water, must be used; the common spring-waters turning it milky, and precipitating a part of the dissolved silver.—It is to be observed also, that if the liquor touches the skin, it has the same effect on it as on the matter to be stained, changing the part moistened with it to an indelible black.—Hair may also be dyed of any colour, in the same manner as wool.\n\nHair which does not curl or buckle naturally, is brought to it by art, by first boiling and then baking it in the following manner: After having picked and sorted the hair, and disposed it in parcels according to lengths, they roll them up and tie them tight down upon little cylindrical instruments, either of wood or earthen ware, a quarter of an inch thick, and hollowed a little in the middle, called pipes, in which flate they are put in a pot over the fire, there to boil for about two hours. When taken out, they let them dry; and when dried, they spread them on a sheet of brown paper, cover them with another, and thus send them to the pastry-cook; who making a crust or coffin around them of common paste, sets them in an oven till the crust is about three-fourths baked.\n\nThe end by which a hair grows to the head is called the head of the hair; and the other, with which they begin to give the buckle, the point. Formerly the peruke-makers made no difference between the ends, but curled and wove them by either indifferently: but this made them unable to give a fine buckle; hair woven by the point never taking a right curl. Foreigners own themselves obliged to the English for this discovery, which was first carried abroad by a peruke-maker of our country.\n\nHair is also used in various other arts and manufactures.—In particular, the hair of beavers, hares, conies, &c., is the principal matter whereof hats are made. Spread on the ground, and left to putrefy on corn-lands, hair, as all other animal substances, viz. horns, hoofs, blood, garbage, &c., proves good manure.\n\nHair, in Farriery, is generally called the coat; and, with regard to horses, deserves particular consideration. The hair growing on the fetlock serves as a defence to the prominent part of it in travelling in stony ways or in frosty weather. If the hair of a horse's neck, and the parts most uncovered, be close, smooth, and sleek, it is an indication of his being in health and good case. In order to make the hair of a horse soft and sleek, he must be kept warm at heart, for the least inward cold will cause the hair to flare; also sweat him often, for that will loosen and raise the dust and filth that renders his coat foul; and when he is in the heat of a sweat, scrape off all the white foam, sweat, and filth, that is raised up with an old sword blade; and also when he is blooded, if you rub him all over with his own blood, repeating it two or three days, and curry and dress him well, it will make his coat shine as if covered with a fine varnish.\n\nHair falling from the mane or tail is caused either by his having taken some heat, which has engendered a dry mange; or from some surfeit, which causes the evil humours to resort to those parts. To cure this, anoint the horse's mane and crest with black soap; make a strong ley of ashes, and wash it all over with it. But if a canker should grow on a horse's tail, which will eat away both flesh and bone, then put some oil of vitriol to it, and it will consume it; and if you find that the vitriol corrodes too much, you need only wet it with cold water, and it will put a stop to it.\n\nIf you would take away hair from any part of a horse's body, boil half a pound of lime in a quart of water, till a fourth part is consumed, to which add an ounce of orpiment; make this into a plaster, and lay it on.\n\nHair, or Down, of plants; a general term expressive of all the hairy and glandular appearances on the surface of plants, to which they are supposed by naturalists to serve the double purpose of defensive weapons and vessels of secretion.\n\nThese hairs are minute threads of greater or less length and solidity; some of them visible to the naked eye, whilst others are rendered visible only by the help of glasses. Examined by a microscope, almost all the parts of plants, particularly the young stalks or stems, appear covered with hairs.\n\nHairs on the surface of plants present themselves under various forms; in the leguminous plants, they are generally cylindric; in the mallow tribe, terminated in a point; in agrimony, shaped like a fish hook; in nettle, awl-shaped and jointed; and in some compound flowers with hollow or funnel-shaped florets, they are terminated in two crooked points.\n\nProbable as some experiments have rendered it, that the hairs on the surface of plants contribute to some organic secretion, their principal use seems to be to preserve the parts in which they are lodged from the bad effects of violent frictions, from winds, from extremes of heat and cold, and such like external injuries.\n\nM. Guettard, who established a botanical method from the form, situation, and other circumstances of the hairy and glandular appearances on the surface of plants, demonstrated, that these appearances are generally constant and uniform in all the plants of the same genus. The same uniformity seems to characterize all the different genera of the same natural order.\n\nThe different sorts of hairs which form the down upon the surface of plants were imperfectly distinguished by Grew in 1682, and by Malpighi in 1686. M. Guettard just mentioned was the first who examined the subject both as a botanist and a philosopher. His observations were published in 1747.\n\nHair-Cloths, in military affairs, are large pieces of cloth made with half hair. They are used for covering the powder in wagons, or upon batteries; as also for covering charged bombs or hand-grenades, and many other uses in magazines.\n\nHair-Powder. See Starch.\nHAIR-WORM. See Gordius, Helminthology Index.\n\nHAKE, the English name of a fish common in the English and some other seas, called by authors the merluccius and lucius marinus. This fish was used of old dried and salted. Hence the proverb obtains in Kent, \"As dry as a hake.\" See Ichthyology Index.\n\nHAKLUYT, Richard, a naval historian, is supposed to have been born in London about the year 1533, and descended of a gentle family in Herefordshire, as the name frequently occurs in the list of high sheriffs for that county in former reigns. He was educated at Westminster-school; and thence, in 1570, removed to Christ-church, Oxford; where he applied himself particularly to the study of cosmography, and read public lectures in that science. Sir Edward Stafford being sent ambassador to France in 1583, Mr Hakluyt was one of his attendants, probably in the capacity of chaplain. He was at this time master of arts and professor of divinity. In 1585 he obtained the royal mandate for the next vacant prebend of Bristol, to which preferment he succeeded during his residence at Paris. Constantly attentive to his favourite cosmographical inquiries, in searching the French libraries, he found a valuable history of Florida, which had been discovered about 20 years before by Captain Londoniere and others: this he caused to be published, at his own expense, in the French language, and soon after revised and republished Peter Martyr's book De orbe novo. After five years residence in France, Mr Hakluyt returned to England in company with Lady Sheffield, sister to the lord admiral Howard. In the year 1589 he published his Collection of Voyages in one folio volume, which in 1598 was republished in three. In 1605 our author was made prebendary of Westminster; which, with the rectory of Wetherington in the county of Suffolk, seems to have been the summit of his preferment. He died in 1616, and was buried in Westminster-abbey; bequeathing to his son Edmund his manor of Bridge Place, and several houses in Tothill-street, Westminster. He was an indefatigable and faithful historian. His works are, 1. A Collection of Voyages and Discoveries, a small volume. 2. History of Florida, above mentioned. 3. The principal Navigations, Voyages, and Discoveries of the English Nation, made by Sea or over Land to the farthest distant Quarters of the Earth, at any time within the compass of these 1500 years, in three volumes folio. 4. The Discoveries of the World, from the first Original to the Year 1555, written in the Portugal tongue by Ant. Galvano; corrected, much amended and translated into English, by Richard Hakluyt. 5. Virginia richly valued, by the Description of the Main Land of Florida, her next Neighbour, &c., written by a Portugal gentleman of Elvas, and translated by Richard Hakluyt. Besides these, he left several manuscripts, which were printed in Purchas's collection.\n\nHALBERSTADT, a small principality of Germany, bounded on the north-east by the duchy of Magdeburg, on the south by the principality of Anhalt, on the west by the diocese of Hildesheim, on the east by part of the electorate of Saxony, and on the north by Brunswick Wolfenbuttle. It is near 40 miles in length and 30 in breadth. The soil in general is fertile in corn and flax; and there are some woods, though in general fuel is scarce. There are three large towns in it which send representatives to the diet, together with 10 small ones, and 91 county-towns and villages. The number of the inhabitants is computed at about 200,000: the greatest part of them are Lutherans; but there are also Calvinists, Jews, and Roman Catholics. The manufactures are chiefly woollen (for the country produces a great number of sheep); the exports are grain, and a kind of beer called broilhan. The annual revenue arising from this principality, and the incorporated counties and lordships, is said to amount to 500,000 rix-dollars. Till the treaty of Westphalia in 1648 this country was a diocese, but was then transferred to the electoral house of Brandenburg as a temporal principality. It is entitled to a vote both in a diet of the empire and that of the circle. The principal places are Halberstadt, Groningen, Oschersleben, Osterwick, &c.\n\nHALBERSTADT, a city of Germany, in the circle of Lower Saxony, seated near the river Hotheim. It is a neat uniform place; and has some good churches and other handsome buildings, of which the cathedral is the chief. There is an inn in this place, which is looked upon to be the largest and to have the best accommodations of any in Europe. Before the Reformation, it was a bishop's see. E. Long. 11. 24. N. Lat. 52. 6.\n\nHALBERT, or Halbard, in the art of war, a well-known weapon carried by the sergeants of foot and dragoons. It is a sort of spear, the shaft of which is about five feet long, and made of ash or other wood. Its head is armed with a steel point, not unlike the point of a two-edged sword. But, besides this sharp point which is in a line with the shaft, there is a cross-piece of steel, flat and pointed at both ends; but generally with a cutting edge at one extremity, and a bent sharp point at the other; so that it serves equally to cut down or to push withal. It is also useful in determining the ground between the ranks, and adjusting the files of a battalion. The word is formed of the German hal, \"hall,\" and bard, \"an hatchet.\" Voßius derives it from the German halbaerdt, of hel, \"clarus, splendens,\" and baerit, \"axe.\"\n\nThe halbert was anciently a common weapon in the army, where there were companies of halbardiers. It is said to have been used by the Amazons, and afterwards by the Rhaetians and Vindelicians about the year 570.\n\nIt was called the Danish axe, because the Danes bore a halbert on the left shoulder. From the Danes it was derived to the Scots, from the Scots to the English Saxons, and from them to the French.\n\nHALCYON, a name given by the ancients to the alcedo or king's fisher. See Alcedo, Ornithology Index.\n\nHALCYON Days, in antiquity, a name given to seven days before and as many after the winter solstice; by reason the halcyon, invited by the calmness of the weather, laid its eggs in nests built in the rocks, close by the brink of the sea, at this season.\n\nHALDE, John Baptist du, was born at Paris in the year 1674, and having entered into the society of the Jesuits, he was by them entrusted with the care of collecting and arranging the letters which they received from different quarters of the globe. He also filled\nHale, the office of secretary to Father le Tellier, who was confessor to the king of France. He died in the year 1743, leaving a character behind him truly amiable for mildness, piety, and unwearied industry. He was the author of some Latin poems, but that which most distinguished him was his being the editor of the Lettres Edifiantes et Curieuses, from the ninth to the 26th collection inclusive, with a valuable preface written by himself. He was also the author (some say editor) of Description Historique, Geographique, et Physique, de l'Empire de la Chine, et de la Tartarie Chinoise, 4 vols. folio, considered as the completest account of that prodigious empire which has appeared in Europe. It has, with some necessary abridgements, been translated into English. It has all the appearance of veracity, and the style is simple and unaffected.\n\nHALE, in the sea language, signifies pull; as, to hale up, is to pull up; to hale in or out, is to pull in or out. To over-hale a rope, is to hale it too stiff, or to hale it the contrary way.\n\nKeel-HALE. See DUCKING.\n\nHALE, Sir Matthew, lord chief justice of the king's bench in the reign of Charles II. was the son of Robert Hale, Esq. a barrister of Lincoln's Inn, and was born in 1639. He was educated at Oxford, where he made a considerable progress in learning; but was afterwards diverted from his studies by the levities of youth. From these he was reformed by Mr John Glanvill sergeant at law; and applying to the study of the law, entered into Lincoln's Inn. Now the attorney-general took early notice of him, and directed him in his studies. Mr Selden also took much notice of him; and it was this acquaintance that first set Mr Hale on a more enlarged pursuit of learning, which he had before confined to his own profession. During the civil wars, he behaved so well as to gain the esteem of both parties. He was employed in his practice by all the king's party; and was appointed by the parliament one of the commissioners to treat with the king. The murder of King Charles gave him very sensible regret. However, he took the engagement; and was appointed, with several others, to consider of the reformation of the law. In 1653 he was by writ made sergeant at law, and soon after appointed one of the justices of the Common Pleas. Upon the death of Oliver Cromwell he refused to accept of the new commission offered him by Richard his successor. He was returned one of the knights of Gloucestershire in the parliament which called home Charles II. Soon after he was made lord chief baron of the exchequer; but declined the honour of knighthood, till lord chancellor Hyde, sending for him upon business when the king was at his house, told his majesty, that \"there was his modest chief baron?\" upon which he was unexpectedly knighted. He was one of the principal judges that sat in Clifford's Inn about settling the difference between landlord and tenant, after the fire of London, in which he behaved to the satisfaction of all parties concerned, and also in his post of chief baron acted with inflexible integrity. One of the first peers went once to his chamber, and told him, \"That having a suit in law to be tried before him, he was then to acquaint him with it, that he might the better understand it when it should come to be tried in court.\" Upon which the lord chief baron interrupted him, and said, \"He did not deal fairly to come to his chambers about such affairs; for he never received information of such causes but in open court, where both parties were to be heard alike.\" Upon which his grace (for he was a duke) went away not a little dissatisfied, and complained of it to the king as a rudeness that was not to be endured; but his majesty bid him content himself that he was used no worse; and said, \"That he verily believed he would have used him no better if he had gone to solicit him in any of his own causes.\"\n\nAnother remarkable incident happened in one of his circuits. A gentleman who had a trial at the assizes had sent him a buck for his table. When Judge Hale therefore heard his name, he asked \"if he was not the same person who had sent him the venison?\" and finding that he was the same, told him, that \"he could not suffer the trial to go on till he had paid him for his buck.\" The gentleman answered, that \"he never sold his venison; and that he had done nothing to him which he did not do to every judge who had gone that circuit;\" which was confirmed by several gentlemen present. The lord chief baron, however, would not suffer the trial to proceed till he had paid for the present: upon which the gentleman withdrew the record. In short, he was in 1671 advanced to be lord chief justice of the king's bench; but about four years after this promotion, his health declining, he resigned his post in February 1675-6, and died in December following. This excellent man, who was an ornament to the bench, to his country, and to human nature, wrote, 1. An Essay on the Gravitation and Non-gravitation of Fluid Bodies. 2. Observations touching the Torricellian Experiment. 3. Contemplations, moral and divine. 4. The Life of Pomponius Atticus, with political and moral Reflections. 5. Observations on the Principles of natural Motion. 6. The primitive Origination of Mankind. He also left a great number of manuscripts, in Latin and English, upon various subjects; among which are, his Pleas of the Crown, since published by Mr Emlyn in two volumes folio; and his Original Institution, Power, and Jurisdiction of Parliaments.\n\nHALES, STEPHEN, D.D. a celebrated divine and philosopher, was born in 1677. He was the fifth son of Thomas Hales, Esq. the eldest son of Sir Robert Hales, created a baronet by King Charles II. and Mary the heiress of Richard Langley of Abbots-Wood in Hertfordshire. In 1696 he was entered a pensioner at Bennet-college, Cambridge; and was admitted a fellow in 1703, and became bachelor of divinity in 1711. He soon discovered a genius for natural philosophy. Botany was his first study; and he used frequently to make excursions among Gogmagog hills, in company with Dr Stukely, with a view of profiting that study. In these expeditions he likewise collected fossils and insects, having contrived a curious instrument for catching such of the latter as have wings. In company with this friend he also applied himself to the study of anatomy, and invented a curious method of obtaining a representation of the lungs in lead. They next applied themselves to the study of chemistry; in which, however, they did not make any remarkable discoveries. In the study of alchemy Mr Hales was equally assiduous. Having made himself acquainted with the Newtonian system, he contrived a machine for...\nfor showing the phenomena on much the same principles with that afterwards made by Mr Rowley, and, from the name of his patron, called an Ortery.\n\nAbout the year 1710 he was presented to the perpetual cure of Teddington near Twickenham, in Middlesex; and afterwards accepted of the living of Porlock in Somersetshire, which vacated his fellowship in the college, and which he exchanged for the living of Faringdon in Hampshire. Soon after, he married Mary, the daughter and heiress of Dr Newce, who was rector of Haliham in Suffolk, but resided at Much-Haddon in Hertfordshire. On the 13th of March 1718, he was elected member of the Royal Society; and on the 5th of March, in the year following, he exhibited an account of some experiments he had lately made on the effect of the sun's warmth in raising the sap in trees. This procured him the thanks of the society, who also requested him to prosecute the subject. With this request he complied with great pleasure; and on the 14th of June 1725 exhibited a treatise in which he gave an account of his progress. This treatise being highly applauded by the society, he farther enlarged and improved it; and in April 1727 he published it under the title of Vegetable Statics. This work he dedicated to his late majesty King George II, who was then prince of Wales; and he was the same year chosen one of the council of the Royal Society, Sir Hans Sloane being at the same annual election chosen their president. The book being well received, a second edition of it was published in 1731. In a preface to this edition Mr Hales promised a sequel to the work, which he published in 1733 under the title of Statical Essays, &c. In 1732 he was appointed one of the trustees for establishing a new colony in Georgia. On the 5th of July 1733 the university of Oxford honoured him with a diploma for the degree of doctor in divinity; a mark of distinction the more honourable, as it is not usual for one university to confer academical honours on those who are educated at another. In 1734, when the health and morals of the lower and middling classes of people were subverted by the excessive drinking of gin, he published, though without his name, A friendly Admonition to the Drinkers of Brandy and other spirituous Liquors; which was twice reprinted. The latter end of the same year he published a sermon which he preached at St Bride's before the rest of the trustees for establishing a new colony in Georgia. His text was, \"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ;\" Galatians vi. 2. In 1739 he printed a volume in 8vo, entitled, Philological Experiments on Sea-water, Corn, Flesh, and other Substances. This work, which contained many useful instructions for voyagers, was dedicated to the lords of the admiralty. The same year he exhibited to the Royal Society an account of some farther experiments towards the discovery of medicines for dissolving the stone in the kidneys and bladder, and preserving meat in long voyages; for which he received the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley's donation. The year following he published some account of Experiments and Observations on Mrs Stephenson's Medicines for dissolving the Stone, in which their dissolvent power is inquired into and demonstrated.\n\nIn 1741 he read before the Royal Society an account of an instrument which he invented, and called a ventilator, for conveying fresh air into mines, hospitals, prisons, and the close parts of ships: he had communicated it to his particular friends some months before; and it is very remarkable, that a machine of the same kind, for the same purpose, was in the spring of the same year invented by one Martin Tricewald, an officer in the service of the king of Sweden, called captain of mechanics, for which the king and senate granted him a privilege in October following, and ordered every ship of war in the service of that state to be furnished with one of them; a model also of this machine was sent into France, and all the ships in the French navy were also ordered to have a ventilator of the same sort. It happened also, that about the same time one Sutton, who kept a coffeehouse in Aldergate-street, invented a ventilator of another construction to draw off the foul air out of ships by means of the cook-room fire: but poor Sutton had not interest enough to make mankind accept the benefit he offered them; though its superiority to Dr Hales's contrivance was evident, and among others Dr Mead and the ingenious Mr Benjamin Robins gave their testimony in its favour (See Air-Pipes.) The public, however, is not less indebted to the ingenuity and benevolence of Dr Hales, whose ventilators came more easily into use for many purposes of the greatest importance to life, particularly for keeping corn sweet, by blowing through it fresh showers of air; a practice very soon adopted by France, a large granary having been made, under the direction of Duhamel, for the preservation of corn in this manner, with a view to make it a general practice.\n\nIn 1743, Dr Hales read before the Royal Society a description of a method of conveying liquors into the abdomen during the operation of tapping, and it was afterwards printed in their Transactions. In 1745, he published some experiments and observations on tar-water, which he had been induced to make by the publication of a work called Sirius, in which the learned and most excellent Dr Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, had recommended tar-water as an universal medicine; on this occasion several letters passed between them on the subject, particularly with respect to the use of tar-water in the disease of the horrid cattle. In the same year he communicated to the public, by a letter to the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, a description of a back-heaver, which will winnow and clean corn much sooner and better than can be done by the common method. He also, at the same time, and by the same channel, communicated to the public a cheap and easy way to preserve corn sweet in sacks; an invention of great benefit to farmers, especially to poor leapers, who want to keep small quantities of corn for some time, but have no proper granary or repository for that purpose. He also the same year took the same method to publish directions how to keep corn sweet in heaps without turning it, and to sweeten it when musty. He published a long paper, containing an account of several methods to preserve corn by ventilators; with a particular description of several sorts of ventilators, illustrated by a cut, so that the whole mechanism of them may be easily known, and the machines constructed by a common carpenter. He published also in the same volume, but without his name, a detection of the fallacious boasts concerning the efficacy of the liquid shell\nHales in dissolving the stone in the bladder. In 1746 he communicated to the Royal Society a proposal for bringing small passable stones from, and with ease, out of the bladder; and this was also printed in their Transactions. In the Gentleman's Magazine for July 1747, he published an account of a very considerable improvement of his back-heaver, by which it became capable of clearing corn of the very small grain, seeds, blacks, flint-balls, &c., to such perfection as to make it fit for seed-corn. In 1748 he communicated to the Royal Society a proposal for checking, in some degree, the progress of fires, occasioned by the great fire which happened that year in Cornhill: And the substance of this proposal was printed in their Transactions. In the same year he also communicated to the Society two memoirs, which are printed in their Transactions; one on the great benefit of ventilators, and the other on some experiments in electricity. In 1749, his ventilators were fixed in the Savoy prison, by order of the right hon. Henry Fox, Esq.; then secretary at war, afterwards Lord Holland; and the benefit was so great, that though 50 or 100 in a year often died of the gaol distemper before, yet from the year 1749 to the year 1752 inclusive, no more than four persons died, though in the year 1750 the number of prisoners was 240; and of those four, one died of the small-pox, and another of intemperance. In the year 1750 he published some considerations on the causes of earthquakes; occasioned by the slight shocks felt that year in London. The substance of this work was also printed in the Philosophical Transactions. The same year he exhibited an examination of the strength of several purging waters, especially of the water of Jeffop's well, which is printed in the Philosophical Transactions.\n\nDr Hales had now been several years honoured with the esteem and friendship of his royal highness Frederick prince of Wales; who frequently visited him at Teddington, from his neighbouring palace at Kew, and took a pleasure in surprising him in the midst of those curious researches into the various parts of nature which almost incessantly employed him. Upon the prince's death, which happened this year, and the settlement of the household of the princess dowager, he was, without his solicitation, or even knowledge, appointed clerk of the closet or almoner to her royal highness. In 1751 he was chosen by the college of physicians to preach the annual sermon called Crozone's lecture: Dr William Crowne having left a legacy for a sermon to be annually preached on \"the wisdom and goodness of God displayed in the formation of man.\" Dr Hales's text was, With the ancient is wisdom, and in length of days understanding, Job xii. 12. This sermon, as usual, was published at the request of the college. In the latter end of the year 1752, his ventilators, worked by a windmill, were fixed in Newgate, with branching trunks to 24 wards; and it appeared that the disproportion of those that died in the gaol before and after this establishment was as 16 to 7. He published also a farther account of his success, and some observations on the great danger arising from foul air, exemplified by a narrative of several persons seized with the gaol-fever by working in Newgate.\n\nOn the death of Sir Hans Sloane, which happened in the year 1753, Dr Hales was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris in his room. The same year he published in the Gentleman's Magazine some farther considerations about means to draw the foul air out of the sick rooms of occasional army hospitals, and private houses in town. He also published many other curious particulars relative to the use and success of ventilators. The same year a description of a lea-gage, which the Doctor invented to measure unfathomable depths, was communicated to the public in the same miscellany: this paper was drawn up about the year 1732 or 1733, by the Doctor, for Colin Campbell, Esq. This gentleman employed the ingenious Mr Hawkshaw to make the machine it describes, which was tried in various depths, and answered with great exactness. It was however lost near Bermuda. In 1754, he communicated to the Royal Society some experiments for keeping water and fish sweet with lime-water, an account of which was published in the Philosophical Transactions. He also continued to enrich his memoirs with many useful articles from this time till his death, particularly a method of forwarding the distillation of fresh from salt water by blowing showers of fresh air up through the latter during the operation. In 1757 he communicated to the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine an easy method of purifying the air, and regulating its heat in melon-frames and greenhouses; also further improvements in his method of distilling sea-water.\n\nHis reputation and the interest of his family and friends might easily have procured him farther preferment: but of farther preferment he was not desirous; for being nominated by his late majesty to a canonry of Windsor, he engaged the princes to request his majesty to recall his nomination. That a man so devoted to philosophical studies and employments, and so conscientious in the discharge of his duty, should not desire any preferment which would reduce him to the dilemma either of neglecting his duty, or foregoing his amusement, is not strange; but that he would refuse an honourable and profitable appointment, for which no duty was to be done that would interrupt his habits of life, can scarce be imputed to his temperance and humility without impeaching his benevolence; for if he had no wish of anything more for himself, a liberal mind would surely have been highly gratified by the distillation of so considerable a sum as a canonry of Windsor would have put into his power, in the reward of industry, the alleviation of distress, and the support of helpless indigence. He was, however, remarkable for social virtue and sweetness of temper; his life was not only blameless, but exemplary in a high degree; he was happy in himself and beneficial to others, as appears by this account of his attainments and pursuits; the constant serenity and cheerfulness of his mind, and the temperance and regularity of his life, concurred, with a good constitution, to preserve him in health and vigour to the uncommon age of fourscore and four years. He died at Teddington in 1761; and was buried, pursuant to his own directions, under the tower of the parish church, which he built at his own expense not long before his death.—Her royal highness the princess of Wales erected a monument to his memory in Westminster abbey.\nHALLESIA, a genus of plants belonging to the dog-decandria clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 18th order, Bicornes.

His name, in his native country, was Bobowski. He learnt many languages, and Sir Paul Ricaut owns he was indebted to him for several things which he relates in his Profess State of the Ottoman empire. He held a great correspondence with the English, who persuaded him to translate some books into the Turkish language; and he proposed to return into the bosom of the Christian church, but died before he could accomplish the design. Dr Hyde published his book Of the Liturgy of the Turks, their pilgrimages to Mecca, their circumcision and visiting of the sick. He translated the catechism of the church of England and the bible into the Turkish language. The MS. is lodged in the library of Leyden. He wrote likewise a Turkish grammar and dictionary.\n\nHALICARNASSUS, in Ancient Geography, a principal town of Caria, said to be built by the Argives, and situated between two bays, the Ceramicus and Jausus.\n\nIt was the royal residence, (called Zephyra formerly); especially of Maulolus, made more illustrious by his monument.

It was divided into 35 squares, each containing 16 lots of 40 by 60 feet; one established church wd. one meeting-house, and a small number of houses out of the regular streets.\n\nThe town was originally guarded by forts on the outside; but from the commencement of the American revolution, it was very strongly fortified. Along the river Chebucto, to the southward of the town, are buildings and fish-flakes for at least two miles, and to the northward on the river for about one mile. The plan, however, was greatly improved by the earl of Halifax, who was the original contriver. The proclamation issued for this settlement, offered 50 acres of land to every solder and sailor who would settle in that part of America, without rent or service, for ten years, and no more than one shilling per annum for each 50 acres ever afterwards: to every solder and sailor who had a wife and children, ten acres more were added for every individual of his family, and for every increase that should afterwards happen in the same proportion: To each non-commissioned officer 80 acres, and 15 for each of his family; 200 acres to each ensign; 300 to each lieutenant; 400 to each captain; 600 to every officer in rank above a captain, and 30 for each of his family. Government also engaged to transport and maintain the new settlers for one year at its own expense, and furnish them with such arms, provisions, utensils, implements, &c., as should be necessary to put them in a way to cultivate their lands, to build habitations, and to commence a fishery. The same conditions were likewise offered to all carpenters and other handicraftsmen; and surgeons were offered the same conditions with the ensigns.—This proclamation was published in March, and by the month of May 3700 persons had offered themselves. They accordingly embarked, and established themselves in the bay of Chebucto; calling the city Halifax, from the title of their patron. Before the end of October the same year, 330 comfortable wooden houses were built, and as many more during the winter.—The same year in which the settlers embarked, the government granted them 40,000l. for their expenses. In 1750, they granted 57,482l. 17s. 3½d. for the same purpose; in 1751, 53,927l. 14s. 4d.; in 1752, 61,492l. 19s. 4½d.; in 1753, 94,615l. 12s. 4d.; in 1754, 58,447l. 2s.; and in 1755, 49,418l. 7s. 8d.—The place at last attained a degree of splendor that seemed to rival the first cities in the united states; for this it has been equally indebted to the American war, to the great increase of population from the exiled loyalists, and the fostering care of Great Britain. About this time the number of inhabitants was more than doubled in ten years.\n\nThe harbour, which is well sheltered from all winds, is so spacious, that a thousand fall of ships may ride in safety. Upon it there are built a great number of commodious wharfs, which have from 12 to 18 feet water at all times of the tide, for the convenience of loading and unloading ships. The streets of the town are regularly laid out, and cross each other at right angles; the whole rising gradually from the water upon the side of a hill whose top is regularly fortified, but not so as to be able to withstand a regular attack. Many considerable merchants reside at this place, and are possessed of shipping to the amount of several thousand tons, employed in a flourishing trade both with Europe and the West Indies. There is a small but excellent careening yard for ships of the royal navy that are upon this station, or that may have occasion to come in to refit, and take water, fuel, or fresh provisions on board, in their passage.\npassage to and from the West Indies. It is always kept well provided with naval stores; and ships of the line are hove down and repaired with great ease and safety. Several batteries of heavy cannon command the harbour, particularly those that are placed upon George's island, which being very steep and high, and situated in mid-channel, a little way below the town, is well calculated to annoy vessels in any direction, as they must of necessity pass very near it before they are capable of doing any mischief. Above the careening yard, which is at the upper end of the town, there is a large basin, or piece of water, communicating with the harbour below, near 20 miles in circumference, and capable of containing the whole navy of England, entirely sheltered from all winds, and having only one narrow entrance, which, as we observed before, leads into the harbour. There are a number of detached settlements lately formed by the loyalists upon the basin; the lands at a small distance from the water being generally thought better than those near to Halifax; but what success may attend their labours, will require some time to determine. An elegant and convenient building has been erected near the town for the convalescence of the navy; but the healthiness of the climate has as yet prevented many persons from becoming patients, scarcely any ships in the world being so free from complaints of every kind, in regard to health, as those that are employed upon this station. There is a very fine lighthouse, standing upon a small island just off the entrance of the harbour, which is visible, either by night or day, six or seven leagues off at sea.\n\nHALIFAX, earl of. See SAVILLE.\n\nHALIFAX, a town in the west riding of Yorkshire in England, seated on the river Calder, in W. Long. 2°. O. N. Lat. 53°. 45'. It has the title of an earldom, and is very eminent for the clothier trade. The parish is said to be the most populous, if not the most extensive, in England; for it is above 30 miles in circumference; and, besides the mother church at Halifax, and 16 meeting-houses, has 12 chapels, two of which are parochial. What is a little singular, all the meeting-houses here, except the quakers, have bells and burying grounds. The woollens principally manufactured here are kerseys and falloons. Of the former it is affirmed, that one dealer hath sent by commission 60,000 pounds worth in a year to Holland and Hamburg; and of the latter, it is said, 100,000 pieces are made in this parish yearly. The inhabitants here and in the neighbouring towns are entirely employed in these manufactures, that agriculture is but little minded. Most of their provisions of all sorts are brought from the north and east ridings, and from Lancashire, Cheshire, Nottinghamshire, and Warwickshire. The markets are very much crowded for the buying and selling provisions and manufactures. The cloths, at first erecting of the woollen manufactures in these parts, having been frequently stolen off the tenters in the night, a law was made, by which the magistrates of Halifax were empowered to pass sentence on and execute all offenders, if they were taken in the fact, or owned it, or if the stolen cloth was found upon them, provided also the crime was committed, and the criminal apprehended, within the liberties of the forest of Hardwick. These found guilty were executed in the following manner: an axe was drawn by a pulley to the top of a wooden engine, and fastened by a pin, which being pulled out, the axe fell down in an instant, and did its work. If they had stole an ox, horse, or any other beast, it was led with them to the scaffold, and there fastened by a cord to the pin that held up the axe; and when the signal was given by the jurors, who were the first burghers within the several towns of the forest, the beast was driven away, and the pin plucked out, upon which the axe fell and did its office. This severe and summary course of justice gave occasion to a kind of litany, which, it is said, is often in the mouths of the beggars and vagrants who usually frequent these places, viz.\n\nFrom Hell, Hull, and Halifax, good Lord deliver us: though neither the engine, nor manner of proceeding against them, are now in use.

Vitruvius mentions three kinds of halls; the tetrastyle, with four columns supporting the platford or ceiling; the Corinthian, with columns all round let into the wall, and vaulted over; and the Egyptian, which had a peristyle of insulated Corinthian columns, bearing a second order with a ceiling.\n\nThe hall is properly the finest as well as first member of an apartment: and in the houses of ministers of state, magistrates, &c., is the place where they dispatch business, and give audience. In very magnificent buildings, where the hall is larger and loftier than ordinary, and placed in the middle of the house, it is called a saloon.\n\nThe length of a hall should be at least twice and a quarter its breadth; and in great buildings, three times its breadth. As to the height of halls, it may be two-thirds of the breadth; and, if made with an arched ceiling, it will be much handomer, and less liable to accidents by fire. In this case, its height is found by dividing its breadth into five parts, five of which will be the height from the floor to the under side of the key of the arch.\n\nHall is also particularly used for a court of justice; or an edifice wherein there is one or more tribunals.\n\nIn Westminster-hall are held the great courts of England, viz. the king's bench, chancery, common pleas, and exchequer. In adjoining apartments is likewise held the high court of parliament.\n\nWestminster-hall was the royal palace or place of residence of our ancient kings; who ordinarily held their parliaments, and courts of judicature, in their dwelling-houses (as is still done by the kings of Spain), and frequently sat in person in the courts of judicature as they still do in parliament. A great part of this palace was burnt under Henry VIII.: what remains is still re-\nHALL, a term of rejoicing, sometimes sung Hallelujah or rehearsed at the end of verses on such occasions.\n\nThe word is Hebrew; or rather, it is two Hebrew words joined together: one of them הַלְלוּיָהוּ, and the other יֵהוָה; an abridgment of the name of God, יֵהוָה Jehovah. The first signifies landaute, \"praise ye;\" and the other, Dominum, \"the Lord.\"\n\nSt Jerome first introduced the word hallelujah into the church service: for a considerable time it was only used once a-year in the Latin church, viz. at Easter; but in the Greek church it was much more frequent. St Jerome mentions its being sung at the interments of the dead, which still continues to be done in that church, as also on some occasions in the time of Lent.\n\nIn the time of Gregory the Great, it was appointed to be sung all the year round in the Latin church, which raised some complaints against that pope; as giving too much into the Greek way, and introducing the ceremonies of the church of Constantinople into that of Rome. But he excused himself by alleging, that this had been the ancient usage of Rome; and that it had been brought from Constantinople at the time when the word hallelujah was first introduced under Pope Damascus.\n\nHALLENBERG, a town of Germany, in Westphalia, seven miles of Medebach, and 62 east of Cologne.\n\nHALLENCOURT, a town of France, in the department of Somme, seven miles and a half south of Abbeville.\n\nHALLER, ALBERT VAN, an eminent physician, was born at Bern, on the 16th of October 1708. He was the son of an advocate of considerable eminence in his profession. His father had a numerous family, and Albert was the youngest of five sons. From the first period of his education, he showed a very great genius for literature of every kind: to forward the progress of his studies, his father took into his family a private tutor named Abraham Billode; and such was the discipline exerted by this pedagogue, that the accidental sight of him, at any future period of life, excited in Haller very great uneasiness, and renewed all his former terrors. According to the accounts which are given us, the progress of Haller's studies, at the earliest periods of life, was rapid almost beyond belief. When other children were beginning only to read, he was studying Bayle and Moreri; and at nine years of age he was able to translate Greek, and was beginning the study of Hebrew. Not long after this, however, the course of his education was somewhat interrupted by the death of his father; an event which happened when he was in the 13th year of his age. After this he was sent to the public school at Bern, where he exhibited many specimens of early and uncommon genius. He was distinguished for his knowledge in the Greek and Latin languages; but he was chiefly remarkable for his poetical genius: and his essays of this kind, which were published in the German language, were read and admired throughout the whole empire. In the 16th year of his age he began the study of medicine at Tubingen, under those eminent teachers Duvernoy and Camerarius; and continued there for the space of two years, when the great reputation of the justly celebrated...\nlebrated Boerhaave drew him to Leyden. Nor was this distinguished teacher the only man from whose superior abilities he had there an opportunity of profiting. Ruyfus was still alive, and Albinius was rising into fame. Animated by such examples, he spent all the day, and the greatest part of the night, in the most intense study; and the proficiency which he made, gained him universal esteem both from his teachers and fellow students. From Holland, in the year 1727, he came to England. Here, however, his stay was but short; and it was rather his intention to visit the illustrious men of that period, than to prosecute his studies at London. He formed connexions with some of the most eminent of them. He was honoured with the friendship of Douglas and Chefsel; and he met with a reception proportioned to his merit from Sir Hans Sloane, president of the Royal Society. After his visit to Britain, he went to France; and there, under those eminent masters, Winiford and Le Dran, with the latter of whom he resided during his stay in Paris, he had opportunities of prosecuting anatomy, which he had not before enjoyed. But the zeal of our young anatomist was greater than the prejudices of the people at that period, even in the enlightened city of Paris, could admit of. An information being lodged against him to the police for dissecting dead bodies, he was obliged to cut short his anatomical investigations by a precipitate retreat. Still, however, intent on the farther prosecution of his studies, he went to Bafil, where he became a pupil to the celebrated Bernouilli.\n\nThus improved and instructed by the lectures of the most distinguished teachers of that period, by uncommon natural abilities, and by unremitting industry, he returned to the place of his nativity in the 26th year of his age. Not long after this, he offered himself a candidate, first for the office of physician to an hospital, and afterwards for a professorship. But neither the character which he had before he left his native country, nor the fame which he had acquired and supported while abroad, were sufficient to combat the interest opposed to him. He was disappointed in both; and it was even with difficulty that he obtained, in the following year, the appointment of keeper of a public library at Bern. The exercise of this office was indeed by no means suited to his great abilities; but it was agreeable to him, as it afforded him an opportunity for that extensive reading by which he has been so justly distinguished. The neglect of his merit which marked his first outset, neither diminished his ardour for medical pursuits, nor detracted from his reputation either at home or abroad. And soon after he was nominated a professor in the university of Gottingen, by King George II. The duties of this important office he discharged, with no less honour to himself than advantage to the public, for the space of 17 years; and it afforded him an ample field for the exertion of those great talents which he possessed. Extensively acquainted with the sentiments of others respecting the economy of the human body, struck with the diversity of opinions which they held, and sensible that the only means of investigating truth was by careful and candid experiment, he undertook the arduous task of exploring the phenomena of human nature from the original source. In these pursuits he was no less industrious than successful, and there was hardly any function of the body on which his experiments did not reflect either a new or a stronger light. Nor was it long necessary for him, in this arduous undertaking, to labour alone. The example of the preceptor inspired his pupils with the spirit of industrious exertion. Zinn, Zimmerman, Caldani, and many others, animated by a generous emulation, laboured with indefatigable industry to prosecute and to perfect the discoveries of their great master. And the mutual exertion of the teacher and his students, not only tended to forward the progress of medical science, but placed the philosophy of the human body on a more sure, and an almost entirely new, basis. But the labours of Dr Haller, during his residence at Gottingen, were by no means confined to any one department of science. He was not more anxious to be an improver himself, than to instigate others to similar pursuits. To him, the Anatomical Theatre, the School of Midwifery, the Chirurgical Society, and the Royal Academy of Sciences at Gottingen, owe their origin. Such distinguished merit could not fail to meet with a suitable reward from the sovereign under whose protection he then taught. The king of Great Britain not only honoured him with every mark of attention which he himself could bestow, but procured him also letters of nobility from the emperor. On the death of Dillenius, he had an offer of the professorship of botany at Oxford; the states of Holland invited him to the chair of the younger Albinius; the king of Prussia was anxious that he should be the successor of Maupertuis at Berlin. Marshal Keith wrote to him in the name of his sovereign, offering him the chancellorship of the university of Halle, vacant by the death of the celebrated Wolff. Count Orlov invited him to Russia, in the name of his mistress the empress, offering him a distinguished place at St. Petersburg. The king of Sweden conferred on him an unsolicited honour, by raising him to the rank of knighthood of the order of the polar star; and the emperor of Germany did him the honour of a personal visit; during which he thought it no degradation of his character to pass some time with him in the most familiar conversation.\n\nThus honoured by sovereigns, revered by men of literature, and esteemed by all Europe, he had it in his power to have held the highest rank in the republic of letters. Yet, declining all the tempting offers which were made to him, he continued at Gottingen, anxiously endeavouring to extend the rising fame of that medical school. But after 17 years' residence in that university, an ill state of health rendering him less fit for the duties of the important office which he held, he solicited and obtained permission from the regency of Hanover to return to his native city of Bern. His fellow-citizens, who might at first have fixed him among themselves, with no less honour than advantage to their city, were now as sensible as others of his superior merit. A pension was settled upon him for life, and he was nominated at different times to fill the most important offices in the state. These occupations, however, did not diminish his ardour for useful improvements. He was the first president, as well as the greatest promoter, of the Oeconomical Society at Bern; and he may be considered as the father and founder of the Orphan Hospital of that city. Declining health, however, restrained his exertions in the more active scenes\nHalleria, scenes of life, and for many years he was confined entirely to his own house. Even this, however, could not put a period to his utility; for, with indefatigable industry, he continued his favourite employment of writing till within a few days of his death; which happened in the 70th year of his age, on the 12th of December 1777. His Elementa Phylologicae et Bibliotheca Medicine will afford, to latest posterity, undeniable proofs of his indefatigable industry, penetrating genius, and solid judgement. But he was not more distinguished as a philosopher than beloved as a man; and he was not more eminent for his improvement in every department of medical science, than for his piety to God, and benevolence to all mankind.\n\nHALLERIA, a genus of plants belonging to the lidynia class; and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, Perforatae. See Botany Index.\n\nHALLEY, Dr Edmund, an eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in 1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676 he went to the island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of those which lie near the south pole; and having delineated a planisphere in which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in 1678. In the year 1680 he took what is called the grand tour, accompanied by his friend the celebrated Mr Newton. In the midway between Calais and Paris, Mr Halley had a sight of a remarkable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in its return from the sun. He had the November before seen it in its descent; and now hastened to complete his observations upon it, in viewing it from the royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was, to settle a friendly correspondence between the two royal astronomers of Greenwich and Paris; and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a master as Cassini. From thence he went to Italy, where he spent great part of the year 1681; but his affairs calling him home, he returned to England. In 1683, he published his Theory of the variation of the magnetic compass; in which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, with four magnetic poles, or points of attraction: but afterwards thinking that this theory was liable to great exceptions, he procured an application to be made to King William, who appointed him commander of the Paramour pink, with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty's settlements in America.—He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698: but having crossed the line, his men grew sickly; and his lieutenant mutinying, he returned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he set sail a second time in September following, with the same ship, and another of less bulk, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the vast Atlantic ocean from one hemisphere to the other, as far as the ice would permit him to go; and having made his observations at St Helena, Brazil, Cape Verd, Barbadoes, the Madeiras, the Canaries, the coast of Barbary, and many other latitudes, arrived in September 1700; and the next year published a general chart, showing at one view the variation of the compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as he was now called, had been at home little more than half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe the course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal head-lands in the British channel; which having executed with his usual expedition and accuracy, he published a large map of the British channel. Soon after, the emperor of Germany resolving to make a convenient harbour for shipping in the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to view the two ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702; passed over to Holland; and going through Germany to Vienna, he proceeded to Istria: but the Dutch opposing the design, it was laid aside; yet the emperor made him a present of a rich diamond-ring from his finger, and honoured him with a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Presently after his return, he was sent again on the same business; when passing through Hanover, he dined with King George I. then electoral prince, and his sister the queen of Prussia. On his arrival at Vienna, he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new fortifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703; and the same year was made professor of geometry in the university of Oxford, in the room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws conferred on him by that university. He is said to have lost the professorship of astronomy in that city, because he would not profess his belief of the Christian religion. He was scarcely settled at Oxford, when he began to translate into Latin from the Arabic, Apollonius de sectione spatii; and to restore the two books De sectione spatii of the same author, which are lost, from the account given of them by Pappus; and he published the whole work in 1706. Afterwards he had a share in preparing for the press Apollonius's Conics; and ventured to supply the whole eighth book, the original of which is also lost. He likewise added Serenus on the section of the cylinder and cone, printed from the original Greek, with a Latin translation, and published the whole in folio. In 1713, he was made secretary of the Royal Society; in 1720, he was appointed the king's astronomer at the royal observatory at Greenwich, in the room of Mr Flamsteed; and, in 1729, was chosen as a foreign member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He died at Greenwich in 1742. His principal works are, 1. Catalogus stellarum australis. 2. Tabulae astronomicae. 3. An abridgement of the astronomy of comets, &c. We are also indebted to him for the publication of several of the works of the great Sir Isaac Newton, who had a particular friendship for him, and to whom he frequently communicated his discoveries.\n\nHalley's Quadrant.

Others will have the halter to be a lump or mass of lead or stone, with an hole or handle fixed to it, by which it might be carried; and that the halteristae were those who exercised themselves in removing these masses from place to place.\n\nHier. Mercurialis, in his treatise De arte gymnastica, 1. ii. c. 12. distinguishes two kinds of halteristes; for though there was but one halter, there were two ways of applying it. The one was to throw or pitch it in a certain manner; the other only to hold it out at arm's end, and in this posture to give themselves divers motions, swinging the hand backwards and forwards, according to the engraved figures thereof given us by Mercurialis.—The halter was of a cylindrical figure, smaller in the middle where it was held, by one diameter, than at the two ends. It was above a foot long, and there was one for each hand: it was either of iron, stone, or lead.\n\nGalen, De tuend. valetud. lib. i. v. and vi. speaks of this exercise, and shows of what use it is in purging the body of peccant humours; making it equivalent both to purgation and phlebotomy.\n\nHALTON, or Haulton, i.e. High Town, a town of Cheshire, 186 miles from London.

Running down from the foot of Mount Taurus, through Cataonia, and Cappadocia, it divided almost the whole of the Lower Asia, from the sea of Cyprus down to the Euxine, according to Herodotus; who seems to extends its course too far. According to Strabo, himself a Cappadocian, it had its springs in the Great Cappadocia. It separated Paphlagonia from Cappadocia; and received its name ἀπὸ τοῦ ἄλας, from salt, because its waters were of a salt and bitter taste, from the nature of the soil over which they flowed. It is famous for the defeat of Croesus king of Lydia, who was misled by the ambiguous word of this oracle:\n\nΧρυσός ἀλύτη διάκοσμος μεγάλην ἀρχὴν διαλύει.\n\nIf Croesus passes over the Halys he shall destroy a great empire.\n\nThat empire was his own.

With respect to Ham, it is believed that he had all Africa for his inheritance, and that he peopled it with his children. As for himself, it is thought by some that he dwelt in Egypt; but M.

And as to Ham's being worshipped as a god, and called Jupiter Hammon, he thinks people may have been led into this mistake by the similitude of names; and that Jupiter Hammon was the sun, to which divine honours have been paid at all times in Egypt. However that may be, Africa is called the land of Ham, in several places of the psalms, (Psal. lxvii. 51. civ. 23. cv. 22.) In Plutarch, Egypt is called Chemia; and there are some footsteps of the name of Ham or Cham observed in Plochemmis, Piutta-chemmis, which are cantons of Egypt.\n\nHAM, a Saxon word used for \"a place of dwelling;\" a village or town: hence the termination of some of our towns, Nottingham, Buckingham, &c.

It is seated on the river Lippe, on the frontiers of Munster. The adjacent country abounds in corn, hemp, and flax; and the inhabitants get a good deal of money by travellers. It was formerly a Hanse-town, but it is now reduced. E. Long. 7° 50'. N. Lat. 51° 36'.\n\nHAM, a town of Picardy, in France, seated on the river Somme, among marshes. It has three parishes, and there is here a round tower whose walls are 36 feet thick. It was taken by the Spaniards in 1557, but restored by treaty. E. Long. 3° 6'. N.

It is seated on the river Lea, four miles east of London.\n\nHAMADAN. See AMADAN.\n\nHAMADRYADES (formed of ἀνα, together, and δρυς, dryad, of δρύς, oak), in antiquity, certain fabulous deities revered among the ancient heathens, and believed to preside over woods and forests, and to be inclosed under the bark of oaks. The hamadryades were supposed to live and die with the trees they were attached to; as is observed by Servius on Virgil, Eclog. x. ver. 62. after Mnesimachus, the scholiast of Apollonius, &c. who mentions other traditions relating thereto.\n\nThe poets, however, frequently confound the Hamadryads with the Naiads, Naiasae, and rural nymphs in general; witness Catullus, Carm. lxviii. ver. 23. Ovid, Fast. iv. 229. Met. i. ver. 695. xiv. ver. 628. Propertius, Eleg. xx. 32. Virg. Ecl. x. ver. 64. Georg. iv. ver. 382, 383. Fetus calls them Querquetulane, as being issued or sprung from oaks. An ancient poet, Pherecius, in Athenæus, lib. iii. calls the vine, fig-tree, and other fruit-trees, hamadryades, from the name of their mother the oak.\n\nThis common idea among the ancients, of nymphs or intellectual beings annexed to trees, will account for their worshipping of trees; as we find they did, not only from their poets but their historians. Livy speaks of an ambassador's addressing himself to an old oak, as to an intelligent person and a divinity, lib. iii. § 25.\n\nHAMAH, a town of Turkey in Asia, in Syria, situated in E. Long. 34° 55'. N. Lat. 36° 15'. By some travellers it is corruptly called Amar and Amant. Some mistake it for the ancient Apamea; but this is now called Afamiyah, and is situated a day's journey from Hamah. Hamah is situated among hills, and has a castle seated on a hill. It has all along been a considerable place, and in the 13th century had princes of its own. It is very large, and being seated on the ascent of a hill, the houses rise above one another, and make a fine appearance. It is, however, like most other towns under the Turkish government, going to decay. Many of the houses are half ruined; but those which are still standing, as well as the mosques and castle, have their walls built of black and white stones, disposed in such a manner as to form various figures. The river Affi, the ancient Orontes, runs by the side of the castle, and fills the ditches round it, which are cut very deep into the rock. This river, leaving the castle, passes through the town from south to north, and has a bridge over it, though it is pretty broad. In its course through the town it turns 18 great wheels, called by the natives fahi, which raise great quantities of water to a considerable height, and throw it into canals supported by arches, by which means it is conveyed into the gardens and fountains. There are some pretty good bazars or market-places in Hamah, where there is a trade for linen, which is manufactured there, and sent to Tripoli to be exported into Europe.\n\nHAMAMELIS, witch-hazel; a genus of plants belonging to the tetrandria clas; and in the natural method ranking with those of which the order is doubtful. See BOTANY Index.\n\nHAMAM LEEF, a town 12 miles east from Tunis, noted for its hot baths, which are much resorted to by the Tunisians, and are efficacious in rheumatism and many other complaints. Here the bey has a very fine bath, which he frequently permits the consuls and other persons of distinction to use.\n\nHAMATH, a city of Syria, capital of a province of the same name, lying upon the Orontes. \"The entering into Hamath,\" which is frequently spoken of\nHAMAXOBII, in Scripture, (Josh. xiii. 5; Judges iii. 5; 2 Kings xiv. 25; and 2 Chr. vii. 8.) is the narrow pass leading from the land of Canaan through the valley which lies between Libanus and Antilibanus. This entrance into Hamath is set down as the northern boundary of the land of Canaan, in opposition to the southern limits, the Nile or river of Egypt. Josephus, and St Jerome after him, believed Hamath to be Epiphania. But Theodoret and many other good geographers maintain it to be Emesa in Syria. Joshua (xix. 35.) assigns the city of Hamath to the tribe of Naphtali. Toi king of Hamath cultivated a good understanding with David, (2 Sam. viii. 9.) This city was taken by the kings of Judah, and retaken from the Syrians by Jeroboam the second, (2 Kings xiv. 28.) The kings of Assyria made themselves masters of it upon the declension of the kingdom of Israel, and transplanted the inhabitants of Hamath into Samaria, (2 Kings xvii. 24. and xviii. 34. &c.)\n\nHAMAXOBI, HAMAXOBIIANS, in the ancient geography, a people who had no houses, but lived in carriages. The word is formed from ἀγάριον, a carriage or chariot, and εἶναι, to be.\n\nThe Hamaxobii, called also Hamaxobites, were an ancient people of Sarmatia Europaea, inhabiting the southern part of Muscovy, who instead of houses had a sort of tents made of leather, and fixed on carriages to be ready for shifting and travel.\n\nHAMBDEN, JOHN, a celebrated patriot, descended of the ancient family of Hambden in Buckinghamshire, was born in 1594. From the university he went to the inns of court, where he made considerable progress in the study of the law. He was chosen to serve in the parliament which began at Westminster Feb. 5, 1626; and served in all the succeeding parliaments in the reign of Charles I. In 1636 he became universally known, by his refusal to pay ship-money, as being an illegal tax; upon which he was prosecuted. His conduct throughout this transaction gained him a great reputation. When the long parliament began, the eyes of all men were fixed on him as their pater patriae. On January 3, 1642, the king ordered articles of high treason and other misdemeanours to be prepared against Lord Kimbolton, Mr Hambden, and four other members of the house of commons, and went to that house to seize them: but they had retired. Mr Hambden afterwards made a speech in the house to clear himself of the charge laid against him. In the beginning of the wars he commanded a regiment of foot, and did good service to the parliament at the battle of Edgehill. He received a mortal wound in an engagement with Prince Rupert, in Chalgrave-field in Oxfordshire, and died in 1643. He is said to have possessed the Socratic art in a high degree, of interrogating, and under the notion of doubts, infirmating objections, so that he infused his own opinions into those from whom he pretended to learn and receive them. He was, say his panegyrists, a very wise man and of great parts; and had the greatest talents for popularity that were ever possessed by any man: He was matter over all his appetites and passions, and had thereby a very great ascendant over other men's: He was of an industry and vigilance never to be tired out, of parts not to be imposed upon by the most subtile, and of courage equal to his best parts.\n\nVol. X. Part I.\n\nHAMBURG, an imperial city of Germany, seated Hamburg, in E. Long. 9° 55'. N. Lat. 53° 34'. Its name is derived from the Old German word Hammie, signifying a wood, and Burg, a castle; and stands on the north side of the river Elbe. This river is not less than four miles broad opposite the city. It forms two spacious harbours, and likewise runs through most part of it in canals. It flows above Hamburg many miles; but when the tide is accompanied with north-west winds, a great deal of damage is done by the inundations occasioned thereby. There are a great many bridges over the canals, which are mostly on a level with the streets, and some of them have houses on both sides. In the year 833, Ludovicus Pius erected Hamburg first into a bishopric, and afterwards into an archbishopric; and Adolphus III. duke of Saxony, among many other great privileges, granted it the right of fishing in the Elbe, eight miles above and below the city. The kings of Denmark, since they have succeeded to the counts of Holstein, have continually claimed the sovereignty of this place, and often compelled the citizens to pay large sums to purchase the confirmation of their liberties. Nay, it has more than once paid homage to the king of Denmark; who, notwithstanding, keeps a minister here with credentials, which is a sort of acknowledgment of its independency and sovereignty. Though Hamburg has been constantly summoned to the diet of the empire ever since the year 1618, when it was declared a free imperial city by a decree of the aulic council; yet it wastes this privilege, in order to keep fair with Denmark. By their situation among a number of poor princes, the Hamburgers are continually exposed to their rapaciousness, especially that of the Danes, who have extorted vast sums from them. The city is very populous in proportion to its bulk; for though one may walk with ease round the ramparts in two hours, yet it contains, exclusive of Jews, at least 100,000 inhabitants. Here are a great many charitable foundations, the regulations of which are greatly admired by foreigners. All persons found begging in the streets are committed to the house of correction to hard labour, such as the raking of Brazil and other kinds of wood. There is a hospital into which unmarried women may be admitted for a small sum, and comfortably maintained during the residue of their lives. The number of hospitals in this place is greater in proportion to its size than in any other Protestant city in Europe. The revenue of the orphan-house alone is said to amount to between 50 and 60,000l. There is a large lunatic hospital for receiving poor travellers that fall sick. In one of their work-houses or houses of correction, those who have not performed their task are hoisted up in a basket over the table in the common hall while the rest are at dinner, that they may be tantalized with the sight and smell of what they cannot taste. The established religion of Hamburg is Lutheranism; as for the Calvinists and the Roman Catholics, they go to the ambassadors chapels to celebrate their divine service and worship. They have here what they call a private confession, previous to the holy communion, which differs in nothing from that of the church of England, and the abolition is the same; only the poorest of the people here are forced to give a fee to the priests on these occasions.\nHamburg, cafions. Their churches, which are ancient large fabrics, are open thoroughfares, and in some of them there are booksellers shops. The pulpit of St Catherine's is of marble, curiously carved and adorned with figures and other ornaments of gold; and its organ, reckoned one of the best in Europe, has 6000 pipes. The cathedral is very ancient, and its tower leans as if just going to fall; yet, on account of the singularity and beauty of its architecture, the danger attending it has hitherto overlooked. There is still a dean and chapter belonging to this church, though secularized; from whose court there lies no appeal, but to the imperial chamber at Wetzlar. The chapter consists of a provost, dean, 13 canons, 8 minor canons, and 30 vicarii immunes, besides others who are under the jurisdiction of the city. The cathedral, with the chapter, and a number of houses belonging to them, are under the immediate protection of his Britannic majesty as duke of Bremen, who disposes of the prebends that fall in six months of the year, not successively, but alternately with the chapter. Hamburg is almost of a circular form, and six miles in compass. It has five gates, and three entrances by water, viz. two from the Elbe and one from the Alster, being divided into the old and new, which are strongly fortified with moats, ramparts, bastions, and outworks. The ramparts are very lofty and planted with trees; and of such a breadth, that several carriages may go abreast.\n\nIn the new town, towards Altena, are several streets of mean houses inhabited by Jews. Through that entrance from the Elbe, called the lower Baum, pass all ships going to or coming from sea. Every morning, at the opening of it, is seen a multitude of boats and small barks, whose cargoes consist of milk, fruits, and all kinds of provisions, rushing in at the same time. There are some fine cliffs here especially those of St Nicholas, which play every morning early, at one o'clock in the afternoon, and on all festivals and solemnities. The other public structures in this city, besides the churches, make no great appearance; however, the yard, arsenal, and two armories, are well worth seeing. There are several convents or cloisters still remaining; which having been secularized, are now possessed by the Lutherans. One of them holds its lands by this tenure, \"That they offer a glass of wine to every malefactor who is carried by it for execution.\"\n\nThere is a fine exchange, though inferior to that of London. But it was found that the merchants could not be accommodated with every necessary convenience in transacting their business. To supply these defects a new Exchange Hall has been built. This structure is situated near the exchange, in the street called Bohnenstraße. The facade is in a style of great elegance, and the entrance has three arcades supported by pillars of the Doric order. The steps run the whole breadth of the arcades, the intervals between which are ornamented with genii holding garlands of fruits and flowers. The doors leading to the ground floor of the building are on the right and left of the steps. The porter's lodge is on the right, and the door leading to the hall and concert room in the second story, is on the left. The balcony is vaulted, and measures 22 feet in diameter. The facade is terminated by the third or attic story, which is provided with a row of Doric pilasters, above which there is a pediment.\n\nThe entrance into the hall is behind the central arcade, which is ornamented with a row of single statues, and measures 84 feet by 42. It is appropriated to the meeting of merchants and men of business. There are several other saloons or apartments, such as the Egyptian saloon surrounded with columns of granite, between which are landscapes in the manner of a panorama; and the underwriters have two rooms adjoining to this. The reading-room is furnished with all kinds of newspapers and periodical works from every quarter of the globe. The library is to contain all books necessary for commerce, in every language, to collect which must be the work of time. There is an anti-room with embellishments to the left of the great staircase.\n\nThe Hall of Arts is well adapted to the meetings of artists, which ought never to be wanting in establishments of such a nature. Here are five excellent pictures representing poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, and music, together with the portraits of many celebrated men who have distinguished themselves in the arts. The ball and concert room measures 64 feet by 42, and the roof is 30 feet high. The gallery is supported by 18 pillars or columns of the Composite order, and the access to it is by the great staircase. The ceiling represents the firmament studded with stars, and Aurora dispersing the shades of night. There is also an Arabic, Turkish, and Grecian saloon, which the subscribers are at liberty to use as they please. The two spacious dining rooms may be thrown into one, when necessity requires it. They are ornamented with bas-reliefs in plaster of Paris.\n\nThe saloon of the muses and the musical saloon are on the third floor. A large room, in form of a rotunda, receives light from above, and may be considered as an academy of the imitative arts. A complete apparatus for expeditious printing also belongs to this magnificent fabric, under the direction of Mr Conrad Muller, an eminent printer in Hamburg, whose attention will be chiefly directed to the publishing of books on mercantile subjects. The whole edifice is finished in a style of great elegance and taste, and the management given to one who is fully qualified for the office.\n\nIt is the custom of Hamburg, that a citizen, when he dies, must leave the tenth of his estate to the city; and foreigners, not naturalized, must pay a certain sum annually for liberty to trade. The common carts here are only a long pulley laid upon an axle-tree between two wheels, and drawn not by horses, but by men, of whom a dozen or more are sometimes linked to these machines, with slings across their shoulders. Each of the senators, principal elders, divines, regular physicians, and graduates in law, as assiduous at funerals, have a fee. The hangman's house is the common prison for all malefactors; on whom sentence is always passed on Friday, and on Monday they are executed. As, by their laws, no criminal is punishable unless he plead guilty, they have five different kinds of torture to extort such confession. The government of this city is lodged in the senate and three colleges of burgheers. The former is vested with almost every act of sovereignty, except that of laying taxes and managing the finances, which are the prerogatives of the latter. The magistracy is composed of four burgomasters, four syndics, and 24 aldermen, of whom some are lawyers and some merchants. Any person elected into the magistracy,\nHamburg; stracy, and declining the office, must depart the place.\n\nNo burgher is admitted into any of the colleges, unless he dwells in a house of his own within the city, and is possessed of 1000 rixdollars in specie, over and above the sum for which the house may be mortgaged; or 2000 in moveable goods, within the jurisdiction of the same. For the administration of justice, here are several inferior courts, from which an appeal lies to the Obergericht, or high court, and from that to the aulic council and other imperial colleges. For naval causes here is a court of admiralty, which, jointly with the city-treasury, is also charged with the care of the navigation of the Elbe, from the city to the river's mouth. In consequence of this, 100 large buoys, some white, others black, are kept constantly floating in the river in summer: but in winter, instead of some of them, there are machines, like those called ice-beacons, to point out the shoals and flats. Subordinate to the admiralty is a company of pilots; and at the mouth of the Elbe is, or at least ought to be, a vessel always riding, with pilots ready to put on board the ships. At the mouth of the river also is a good harbour, called Cuxhaven, belonging to Hamburg; a light-house; and several beacons, some of them very large. For defraying the expense of these, certain tolls and duties were formerly granted by the emperors to the city. Besides the Elbe, there is a canal by which a communication is opened with the Trave, and thereby with Lubeck and the Baltic, without the hazard, trouble, and expense, of going about by the Sound. The trade of Hamburg is exceeding great, in exporting all the commodities and manufactures of the several cities and states of Germany, and supplying them with whatever they want from abroad. Its exports consist of linens of several sorts and countries; as lawns, diapers, Ofenburghs, dowlas, &c., linen-yarn, tin-plates, iron, bras, and steel-ware, clap-board, pipe-staves, waincoat-boards, oak-plank, and timber, kid-skins, corn, beer in great quantities, with flax, honey, wax, aniseed, linseed, drugs, wine, tobacco, and metals. Its principal imports are the woollen manufactures and other goods of Great Britain, to the amount of several hundred thousand pounds a-year; they have also a great trade with Spain, Portugal, and Italy, which is carried on mostly in English bottoms, on account of their Mediterranean passes. Their whale-fishery is also very considerable, 50 or 60 ships being generally sent out every year in this trade. Add to these a variety of manufactures, which are performed here with great success; the chief of which are, sugar-baking, calico-printing, the weaving of damasks, brocades, velvets, and other rich silks. The inland trade of Hamburg is superior to that of any in Europe, unless perhaps we should except that of Amsterdam and London. There is a paper published here at stated times called the Preifcourant, specifying the course of exchange, with the price which every commodity and merchandise bore last upon the exchange. There is also a board of trade, erected on purpose for the advancing every project for the improvement of commerce. Another great advantage to the merchants is, the bank established in 1619, which has a flourishing credit. To supply the poor with corn at a low price, here are public granaries, in which great quantities of grain are laid up. By charters from several emperors, the Hamburghers have a right of coinage, which they actually exercise. The English merchants, or Hamburg Company, as it is called, enjoy great privileges; for they hold a court with particular powers, and a jurisdiction among themselves, and have a church and minister of their own.—This city has a district belonging to it of considerable extent, which abounds with excellent pastures, intermixed with several large villages and noblemen's seats. A small bailiwick, called Bergedorf, belongs to this city and Lubeck.—Though Hamburg has an undoubted right to a seat in the diet of the empire, yet as she pays no contributions to the military chest in time of war, and is also unwilling to draw upon herself the resentment of Denmark, she makes no use of that privilege. There is a schola illibris or gymnasiwm here, well endowed, with able professors, who read lectures in it as at the universities. There are also several free schools, and a great number of libraries, public and private. The public cellar of this town has always a prodigious stock and vein of old hock, which brings in a considerable revenue to the state. Besides the militia or trained bands, there is an establishment of regular forces, consisting of 12 companies of infantry, and one troop of dragoons, under the commandant, who is usually a foreigner, and one who has distinguished himself in the service. There is also an artillery company, and a night-guard: the last of which is posted at night all over the city, and calls the hours.\n\nHAMEL, John Baptiste du, a very learned French philosopher and writer in the 17th century. At 18 he wrote a treatise, in which he explained in a very simple manner Theodorus's three books of Spherics; to which he added a tract upon trigonometry, extremely perspicuous, and designed as an introduction to astronomy. Natural philosophy, as it was then taught, was only a collection of vague, knotty, and barren questions; when our author undertook to establish it upon right principles, and published his Astronomia Physica. In 1666 Mr Colbert proposed to Louis XIV. a scheme, which was approved of by his majesty, for establishing a royal academy of sciences; and appointed our author secretary of it. He published a great many books; and died at Paris in 1756, of mere old age, being almost 83. He was regius professor of philosophy, in which post he was succeeded by M. Varignon. He wrote Latin with purity and elegance.\n\nHAMELIN, a strong town of Germany, in the duchy of Calenberg in Lower Saxony.

Burglary, or nocturnal house-breaking, was by the ancient English law called Hame-secken, as it is in Scotland to this day.\n\nHAM, or Ha-mi, a country of Asia, subject to the Chinese. It is situated to the north-east of China, at the extremity of that desert which the Chinese call Chama, and the Tartars Cobi; and is only 90 leagues distant from the most westerly point of the province of Chenfi. This country was inhabited in the early ages\nby a wandering people named Long. About the year 950 before the Christian era, they lent deputies to pay homage to the emperor of China, and presented some fabrics by way of tribute. The civil wars by which China was torn about the end of the dynasty of Tcheou having prevented affluence from being sent to these people, they fell under the dominion of the Hiung-nou, who appear to have been the same as the Huns, and who at that time were a formidable nation. The Chinese several times lost and recovered the country of Hami. In 131 (the fifth year of the reign of Chunti, of the dynasty of the eastern Han), the emperor kept an officer there in quality of governor. Under the following dynasties, the same vicissitudes were experienced: Hami was sometimes united to the province of Chenfi, sometimes independent of it, and sometimes even of the whole empire. The situation of these people (separated by vast deserts from China, to which, besides, they had no relation, either in language, manners, or customs) must have greatly contributed to facilitate these revolutions. All the tributary states of the empire having revolted in 610, that of Hami followed their example; but it again submitted to the yoke under Tai-tsong, second emperor of the dynasty of Tang, who had sent one of his generals with an army to reduce it. This great prince paid particular attention to his new conquest. He divided it into three districts, and connected its civil and military government in such a manner to that of the province of Chenfi and other neighbouring countries, that tranquillity prevailed there during his reign and several of those that followed. Through Hami all the caravans which went from the west to China, or from China to the west, were obliged to pass. The emperors, predecessors of Tai-tsong, were satisfied with carrying wine to be transported from Hami in skins carried by camels; but “Tai-tsong (says the Chinese history) having subdued the kingdom of Hami, ordered some vine-plants of the species called majou, to be brought him, which he caused to be planted in his gardens; he, besides, learned the manner of making wine, the use of which proved both serviceable and hurtful to him.” Luxury and effeminacy having weakened the dynasty of Tang, the Mahometans (who had made a rapid progress in all the countries that are situated between Persia, Cobi, and the Caspian sea) advanced as far as Hami, which they conquered. It appears, that this country afterwards had princes of its own, but dependent on the Tartars, who successively ruled these immense regions. The Yuen or Mogul Tartars again united the country of Hami to the province of Chenfi; and this reunion subsisted until 1360, at which time the emperor formed it into a kingdom, on condition of its princes doing homage and paying tribute. The king of Hami was honoured with a new title in 1404, and obtained a golden seal. After a contest of several years for the succession to the throne, the kingdom of Hami fell a prey to the king of Tou-eulh-fan. This yoke soon became uneasy to the people of Hami: they revolted from their new masters, and made conquests from them in their turn. The new king whom they made choice of did not long possess the throne: he was conquered and killed in a bloody battle which he fought with the king of Tou-eulh-fan, who also perished some time after.\n\nSince this epocha, the country of Hami has been successively exposed to anarchy, or governed by its own princes. The prince who filled the throne in 1696 acknowledged himself a vassal of the empire, and sent as tribute to Peking camels, horses, and fabrics. Kang-hi received his homage with the usual ceremonies, and published a diploma, which established the rank that the king of Hami should hold among the tributary princes, the time when he should come to render homage, the nature of the presents necessary for his tribute, the number of auxiliaries he was bound to furnish in time of war, and the manner of his appointing a successor. All these regulations have subsisted till this time.\n\nThe country of Hami, though surrounded by deserts, is accounted one of the most delightful in the world. The soil produces abundance of grain, fruits, leguminous plants, and pasture of every kind. The rice which grows here is particularly esteemed in China; and pomegranates, oranges, peaches, raisins, and prunes, have a most exquisite taste; even the jujubes are so juicy, and have so delicious a flavour, that the Chinese call them perfumed jujubes. There is no fruit more delicate or more in request than the melons of Hami, which are carried to Peking for the emperor’s table. These melons are much more wholesome than those of Europe; and have this singular property, that they may be kept fresh during great part of the winter.—But the most useful and most esteemed production of this country is its dried raisins. There are of two kinds: The first, which are much used in the Chinese medicine, seem to have a perfect resemblance to those known in Europe by the name of Corinthian. The second, which are in much greater request for the table, are smaller and more delicate than those of Provence. The Chinese authors perfectly agree with Mefirs Lemery and Geoffroy, respecting the virtue and qualities of these dried grapes or raisins; but they attribute so much more efficacy to those of Hami than to those of China, that they prescribe them in smaller doses. They observe, that an infusion of the first is of great service in facilitating an eruption of the small-pox about the fourth day, when the patient either is or seems to be too weak; and to promote a gentle perspiration in some kinds of pleuritis or malignant fevers. The dose must be varied according to the age, habit of body, and strength of the patient; great care must be taken to administer this remedy cautiously and with judgment. The emperor caused plants to be transported from Hami to Peking, which were immediately planted in his gardens. As these plants were cultivated with extraordinary care, under his own eyes, they have perfectly succeeded. The raisins produced by them are exceedingly sweet, and have a most exquisite flavour.\n\nAlthough the country of Hami (the latitude of which is 42° 53' 20\") lies farther towards the north than several of the provinces of France, we are assured that its climate is more favourable to the culture of vines, and that it gives a superior degree of quality to the grapes. It never rains at Hami; even dew and fogs are scarcely ever seen there; the country is watered only by the snow which falls in winter, and by the water of this snow when melted, which is collected at the bottoms of the mountains, and preserved with great\ngreat care and industry. The method of drying grapes in Hami is much simpler than that practised in the provinces of China. The people of Chenisi hold them over the steam of hot wine, and even sometimes boil them a few seconds in wine in which a little clarified honey has been diluted. In the kingdom of Hami they wait until the grapes are quite ripe; then they expose them to the scorching rays of the sun; afterwards pick them, and leave them in that manner until they are quite dry. However dry these grapes may be, they become shrivelled, without losing any of their substance, and without growing flat: good raisins ought to be almost as crisp as sugar candy.\n\nThe kingdom of Hami contains a great number of villages and hamlets; but it has properly only one city, which is its capital, and has the same name. It is surrounded by lofty walls, which are half a league in circumference, and has two gates, one of which fronts the east, and the other the west. These gates are exceedingly beautiful, and make a fine appearance at a distance. The streets are straight, and well laid out; but the houses (which contain only a ground-floor, and which are almost all constructed of earth) make very little show: however, as this city enjoys a serene sky, and is situated in a beautiful plain, watered by a river, and surrounded by mountains which shelter it from the north winds, it is a most agreeable and delightful residence. On whatever side one approaches it, gardens may be seen which contain every thing that a fertile and cultivated soil can produce in the mildest climates. All the surrounding fields are enchanting: but they do not extend far; for on several sides they terminate in dry plains, where a number of beautiful horses are fed, and a species of excellent sheep, which have large flat tails that sometimes weigh three pounds. The country of Hami appears to be very abundant in fossils and valuable minerals: the Chinese have for a long time procured diamonds and a great deal of gold from it; at present it supplies them with a kind of agate, on which they set a great value. With regard to the inhabitants of this small state, they are brave, capable of enduring fatigue, very dexterous in all bodily exercises, and make excellent soldiers; but they are fickle and soon irritated, and when in a passion they are extremely ferocious and fanguinary.\n\nHAMILTON, a town of Scotland, in Clydesdale, seated on the river Clyde, eleven miles south-east of Glasgow; from whence the noble family of Hamilton take their name, and title of duke. The town is seated in the middle of a very agreeable plain; on one side of which the Hamilton family has a large park, which is near seven miles in circumference, enclosed with a high wall, and well stocked with fallow deer. The rivulet called Avon runs through the park, and falls into the river Clyde, over which last there is a bridge of free-stone. W. Long. 4° 16'. N. Lat. 55° 58'. The original name of this place, or the lands about it, was Cadzow or Cadzow, a barony granted to an ancestor of the noble owner, on the following occasion. In the time of Edward II. lived Sir Gilbert de Hamilton, or Hampton, an Englishman of rank; who happening at court to speak in praise of Robert Bruce, received on the occasion an insult from John de Spenfer, chamberlain to the king, whom he fought and slew. Dreading the resentment of that potent family, he fled to the Scottish monarch; who received him with open arms, and established him at the place possessed by the duke of Hamilton. In aftertimes the name was changed from Cadzow to Hamilton; and in 1445 the lands were erected into a lordship, and the then owner Sir James sat in parliament as Lord Hamilton. The same nobleman founded the collegiate church at Hamilton in 1451, for a provost and several prebendaries. The endowment was ratified at Rome by the pope's bull, which he went in person to procure.—Hamilton house or palace is at the end of the town; a large heavy pile, with two deep wings at right angles with the centre: the gallery is of great extent; and furnished, as well as some other rooms, with most excellent paintings.\n\nHamilton, Anthony, Count of, was descended from a younger branch of the dukes of Hamilton, and born in Ireland about the year 1646. His mother was sister to the duke of Ormond, then viceroy of that country. The troubles of that period compelled his family to retire to France while he was only an infant, and he was brought up in the language and religion of that country. He made different visits to England in the reign of Charles II., but he was prevented from obtaining any public employment in consequence of his religious opinions, to which he constantly adhered. He received from James II. a regiment of infantry in Ireland; but when that monarch's affairs came to be in a ruined condition, Count Hamilton accompanied him back to France, which he never afterwards quitted. On account of his wit and politeness he was very much admired, as well as for the many estimable qualities of his heart. His writings are lively, yet his conversation was serious, and he perhaps indulged too much his propensity to satire. He died in the year 1720 in the 74th year of his age.\n\nThe works of the count in the French language were printed in 6 vols. 12mo. in 1749, which consist of poems, fairy tales, and his Memoirs of Count Grammont, the best of all his compositions, of which Voltaire said, \"it is of all books that in which the most slender groundwork is set off with the gayest, most lively and agreeable style.\" A splendid edition of it, adorned with fine engravings from original portraits, was published by the late Lord Orford, at his own private press.\n\nHamilton, George, earl of Orkney, and a brave warrior, was the fifth son of William earl of Selkirk, and early betook himself to the profession of arms. Being made colonel in 1689-90, he distinguished himself by his bravery at the battle of the Boyne; and soon after, at those of Athlone, Steinkirk, and Landen, and at the sieges of Athlone, Limerick, and Namur. His eminent services in Ireland and Flanders, through the whole course of that war, recommended him highly to King William III.; that, in 1696, he advanced him to the dignity of a peer of Scotland, by the title of earl of Orkney; and his lady, the sister of Edward Viscount Villiers, afterwards earl of Jersey, had a grant made to her, under the great seal of Ireland, of almost all the private estates of the late King James, of very considerable value.\n\nUpon the accession of Queen Anne to the throne, he was promoted to the rank of major-general in 1702, and the next year to that of lieutenant-general, and was likewise made knight of the thistle. His lord-\nHamilton, ship afterwards served under the great duke of Marlborough; and contributed by his bravery and conduct to the glorious victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet, and to the taking several of the towns in Flanders.\n\nIn the beginning of 1710, his lordship, as one of the 16 peers of Scotland, voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverel; and the same year was sworn of the privy-council, and made general of the foot in Flanders. In 1712, he was made colonel of the royal regiment of fusiliers, and served in Flanders under the duke of Ormond. In 1714, he was appointed gentleman-extraordinary of the bed-chamber to King Geo. I. and afterwards governor of Virginia. At length he was appointed constable, governor, and captain of Edinburgh castle, lord-lieutenant of the county of Clydesdale, and field-marshal. He died at his house in Albemarle-street, in 1737.\n\nHamilton, John, the 24th bishop of St Andrew's, to which he was translated from Dunkeld. He was natural son of James the first earl of Arran, and was in great favour at court whilst his friends remained in power. He was one of Queen Mary's privy council, and a steady friend to that unfortunate princess. He performed the ceremony of christening her son, and was at different times lord privy seal and lord treasurer. The queen had reason to lament her not following the advice of this prelate, after the fatal battle of Langside, viz. not to trust her person in England. By the regent earl of Murray, he was declared a traitor, and obliged to seek shelter among his friends. He was unfortunately in the castle of Dumbarton when that fortress was taken by surprise, from whence he was carried to Stirling, where on April 1, 1570, he was hanged on a live tree. The two following satirical verses were written upon this occasion:\n\nVive diu, felix arbor, semperque vireto\nFrondibus, ut nobis talia poma feras.\n\nHamlet, Hamele, or Hampsel, (from the Saxon ham, i.e. domus, and the German let, i.e. membrum), signifies a little village, or part of a village or parish; of which three words the first is now only used, though Kitchen mentions the two last. By Spelman there is a difference between villam integram, villam dimidiam, and hamletam; and Stow expounds it to be the seat of a freeholder. Several county-towns have hamlets, as there may be several hamlets in a parish; and some particular places may be out of a town or hamlet, though not out of the county.\n\nHamlet, a prince celebrated in the annals of Denmark; and whose name has been rendered familiar in this country, and his story interesting, by being the subject of one of the noblest tragedies of our immortal Shakespeare.—Adjoining to a royal palace, which stands about half a mile from that of Kronborg in Elsinore, is a garden, which, Mr Coxe informs us, is called Hamlet's Garden, and is said by tradition to be the very spot where the murder of his father was perpetrated. The house is of modern date, and is situated at the foot of a sandy ridge near the sea. The garden occupies the side of the hill, and is laid out in terraces rising one above another. Elsinore is the scene of Shakespeare's Hamlet; and the original history from which our poet derived the principal incidents of his play is founded upon facts, but so deeply buried in remote antiquity that it is difficult to discriminate truth from fable. Saxo-Grammaticus, who flourished in the 12th century, is the earliest historian of Denmark that relates the adventures of Hamlet. His account is extracted, and much altered, by Belleforest a French author; an English translation of whose romance was published under the title of the Historye of Hamblet: and from this translation Shakespeare formed the ground-work of this play, though with many alterations and additions. The following short sketch of Hamlet's history, as recorded in the Danish annals, will enable the reader to compare the original character with that delineated by Shakespeare.\n\nLong before the introduction of Christianity into Denmark, Horwendillus, prefect or king of Jutland, was married to Geruthra, or Gertrude, daughter of Ruric king of Denmark, by whom he had a son called Amlethus, or Hamlet. Fengo murders his brother Horwendillus, marries Gertrude, and ascends the throne. Hamlet, to avoid his uncle's jealousy, counterfeits folly; and is represented as such an abhorrer of falsehood, that though he constantly frames the most evasive and even absurd answers, yet artfully contrives never to deviate from truth. Fengo, suspecting the reality of his madness, endeavours by various methods (A) to discover the real state of his mind: amongst others, he departs from Elsinore, concerts a meeting between Hamlet and Gertrude, concluding that the former would not conceal his sentiments from his own mother; and orders a courier to conceal himself, unknown to both,\n\n(A) Among other attempts, Fengo orders his companions to leave him in a retired spot, and a young woman is placed in his way, with a view to extort from him a confession that his folly was counterfeited. Hamlet would have fallen into the snare, if a friend had not secretly conveyed to him intelligence of this treachery. He carries the woman to a more secret place, and obtains her promise not to betray him; which she readily consents to, as she had been brought up with him from her infancy. Being asked, upon his return home, if he had indulged his passion, he answers in the affirmative; but renders himself not believed by the most artful subterfuges, which, though true, seemed evidently to mark a disordered understanding, and by the positive denial of the woman. \"Upon this woman,\" as Capell observes, \"is grounded Shakespeare's Ophelia; and his deliverance from this snare by a friend suggested his Horatio:\"—\"the rude outlines,\" as Mr Malone remarks, \"of those characters. But in this piece there are no traits of the character of Polonius: there is indeed a counsellor, and he places himself in the queen's chamber behind the arras; but this is the whole. The ghost of the old Hamlet is likewise the offspring of our author's creative imagination.\" See Capell's School of Shakespeare, vol. iii, p. 20.; and Malone's Supplement, p. 353.\nHamlet both, for the purpose of overhearing their conversation.\n\nThe courtier repairs to the queen's apartment, and hides himself under a heap of straw (b). Hamlet, upon entering the cabinet, suspecting the presence of some spy, imitates, after his usual affectation of folly, the crow of a cock; and, shaking his arms like wings, jumps (c) upon the heap of straw; till, feeling the courtier, he draws his sword, and instantly dispatches him. He then cuts the body to pieces, boils it, and gives it to the hogs. He then avows to his mother that he only perforated a fool, reproaches her for her incestuous marriage with the murderer of her husband; and concludes his remonstrances by saying, \"Instead, therefore, of condoling my insanity, deplore your own infamy, and learn to lament the deformity of your own mind (d).\" The queen is silent; but is recalled to virtue by these admonitions. Fengo returns to Elsinore, sends Hamlet to England under the care of two courtiers, and requests the king by a letter to put him to death. Hamlet discovers and alters the letter; so that, upon their arrival in England, the king orders the two courtiers to immediate execution, and betroths his daughter to Hamlet, who gives many astonishing proofs of a most transcendant understanding. At the end of the year he returns to Denmark, and alarms the court by his unexpected appearance; as a report of his death had been spread, and preparations were making for his funeral. Having reassumed his affected insanity, he purposively wounds his fingers in drawing his sword, which the bystanders immediately fall to the scabbard. He afterwards invites the principal nobles to an entertainment, makes them intoxicated, and in that state covers them with a large curtain, which he fastens to the ground with wooden pegs; he then sets fire to the palace; and the nobles, being enveloped in the curtain, perish in the flames. During this transaction he repairs to Fengo's apartment; and, taking the sword which lay by the side of his bed, puts his own in its place; he instantly awakens and informs him, that Hamlet is come to revenge the murder of his father. Fengo starts from his bed, seizes the sword; but, being unable to draw it, falls by the hand of Hamlet. The next morning, when the populace were assembled to view the ruins of the palace, Hamlet summons the remaining nobles; and in a masterly speech, which is too long to insert in this place, lays open the motives of his own conduct, proves his uncle to have been the assassin of his father; and concludes in the following words: \"Tread upon the ashes of the monster, who, polluting the wife of his murdered brother, joined incest to parricide; and ruled over you with the most oppressive tyranny. Receive me as the minister of a just revenge, as one who felt for the sufferings of his father and his people. Consider me as the person who has purged the disgrace of his country; extinguished the infamy of his mother; freed you from the despotism of a monster, whose crimes, if he had lived, would have daily increased, and terminated in your destruction. Acknowledge my services; and if I have deserved it, present me with the crown. Behold me the author of these advantages: no degenerate person, no parricide; but the rightful successor to the throne, and the pious avenger of a father's murder. I have rescued you from slavery, restored you to liberty, and re-established your glory: I have destroyed a tyrant, and triumphed over an assassin. The recompense is in your hands: you can estimate the value of my services, and in your virtue I rest my hopes of reward.\" This speech...\n\n(b) The reader will recollect, that straw used formerly to be spread over the floors as an article of great luxury.\n\n(c) This part stands thus in the English account: \"The counsellor entered secretly into the queen's chamber, and there hid himself behind the arras, and long before the queen and Hamlet came thither: who being crafty and politic, as soon as he was within the chamber, doubting some treason, and fearing if he should speak feversely and wisely to his mother touching his secret practices he should be understood, and by that means intercepted, used his ordinary manner of disimulation, and began to come (r. crow) like a cock, beating with his arms (in such manner as cockes used to strike with their wings) upon the hangings of the chambers; whereby feeling something stirring under them, he cried, A rat! a rat! and presently drawing his sword, thrust it into the hangings; which done, he pulled the counsellor (half dead) out by the heels, made an end of killing him; and, being slain, cut his body in pieces, which he caused to be boiled, and then cast it into an open vault or privy.\" Malone's Supplement, vol. i. p. 357.\n\n(d) The closet-scene, which is so beautiful in Shakespeare's Hamlet, is thus concisely, but not less finely, described by the Danish historian: \"Cumque mater magno ejulato quetta praefentis filii socordiam deflere coepisset; 'Quid (inquit) mulierum turpissima gravissimi criminis disimulationem fallo lamenti genere expertis, qua fortior more lacivius nefariam ac detestabilem thori conditionem secuta viri tui interfecitorem pleno incepsit finu amplectelis: et ei qui prolixi tua parentem extinxerat obscenissimis blandimentorum illecebris adularis. Ita nempe equae conjugum suorum victoribus maritantur. Brutorum natura haec est; ut in diversa pallium coniugia rapiantur: hoc tibi exemplo prioris mariti memoriam exolevisse coniat. Ego vero non ab te stolidi spectaculum gerer, cum haud dubitem quin is qui fratrem oppresserit, in affines quoque part crudelitate debaccaturus fit: unde stoliditatis que industriae habitum amplifici praetatat, et incoluntatis praefidium ab extrema deliramentorum specie mutari. In animo tamen paternae ultionis studium perferavit; fed rerum occasiones accupor, temporum opportunitates opperior. Non idem omnibus locus competit. Contra obscenum immemorem animum altiorium ingenii modis uti convenit. Tibi vero supervacuum fit meam lamentari deliciatum, que quam jutius ignominiam deplorare debueras. Itaque non alienae sed propriae mentis vitum deflas necelefit. Caetera filiere memineris.\" Tali convitio lacerae matrem ad excolendum virtutis habitum revocavit, praterito ignis praetentibus illecebris preferre docuit.\"\nHammer speech has the desired effect; the greater part of the assembly shed tears, and all who are present unanimously proclaim him king amid repeated acclamations.\n\nHamlet soon after his elevation fails to England, and orders a shield to be made on which the principal actions of his life are represented. The king receives him with feigned demonstrations of joy, falsely assures him that his daughter is dead, and recommends him to repair to Scotland as his ambassador, and to pay his addresses to the queen Gertrude. He gives this insidious advice with the hopes that Hamlet may perish in the attempt; as the queen, who was remarkable for her chastity and cruelty, had such an aversion to all proposals of marriage, that not one of her suitors had escaped falling a sacrifice to her vengeance. Hamlet, in opposition to all difficulties, performs the embassy; and, by the assistance of his shield, which inspires the lady with a favourable opinion of his wisdom and courage, obtains her in marriage, and returns with her to England. Informed by the princes to whom he had been betrothed, that her father meditates his afflatusion, Hamlet avoids his fate by wearing armour under his robe; puts to death the king of England; and sails to Denmark with his two wives, where he is soon afterwards killed in a combat with Vigleth son of Ruric. Hamlet, adds the historian, was a prince, who, if his good fortune had been equal to his deserts, would have rivalled the gods in splendour, and in his actions would have exceeded even the labours of Hercules.\n\nHAMMER, a well-known tool used by mechanics, consisting of an iron head, fixed crosswise upon a handle of wood. There are several sorts of hammers used by blacksmiths; as, 1. The hand-hammer, which is of such weight that it may be wielded or governed with one hand at the anvil. 2. The up-hand fledge, used with both hands, and seldom lifted above the head. 3. The about-fledge, which is the biggest hammer of all, and held by both hands at the farthest end of the handle; and being swung at arms length over the head, is made to fall upon the work with as heavy a blow as possible. There is also another hammer used by smiths, called a riveting hammer; which is the smallest of all, and is seldom used at the forge unless upon small work. — Carpenters and joiners have likewise hammers accommodated to their several purposes.\n\nHAMMERING, the act of beating or extending and fashioning a body under the hammer. When this operation is performed on iron heated for the purpose, it is usually called forging.\n\nHAMMERING, in coining. A piece of money or a medal is said to be hammered when struck, and the impression given, with a hammer and not with a mill.\n\nHAMMERSMITH, four miles west from London, is a hamlet belonging to Fulham, has two charity-schools, a workhouse, a Presbyterian meeting-house, and a fair May 1. There are a number of handsome seats about it, especially towards the Thames; among which the most remarkable is the late Lord Melcombe's, which is a very elegant house, and contains a marble gallery finished at a very great expense.\n\nHAMMOCK, or HAMAC, a kind of hanging bed, suspended between two trees, posts, hooks, or the like, much used throughout the West Indies, as also on board of ships. The Indians hang their hammocks to trees, and thus secure themselves from wild beasts and Hammond insects, which render lying on the ground there very dangerous. According to F. Plumier, who has often made use of the hammock in the Indies, it consists of a large strong coverlet or sheet of coarse cotton, about six feet square: on two opposite sides are loops of the same stuff, through which a string is run, and thereof other loops are formed, all which are tied together with a cord; and thus is the whole fastened to two neighbouring trees in the field, or two hooks in houses. This kind of couch serves at the same time for bed quits, fleeces, pillow, &c.\n\nThe hammock used on board of ships is made of a piece of canvas six feet long and three feet wide, gathered or drawn together at the two ends. There are usually from fourteen to twenty inches in breadth allowed between decks for every hammock in a ship of war; but this space must in some measure depend on the number of the crew, &c. In time of battle the hammocks and bedding are firmly corded and fixed in the nettings on the quarter-deck, or wherever the men are too much exposed to the view or fire of the enemy.\n\nHAMMOND, Henry, D.D., one of the most learned English divines in the 17th century, was born in 1605. He studied at Oxford, and in 1629, entered into holy orders. In 1633 he was inducted into the rectory of Penshurst in Kent. In 1643 he was made archdeacon of Chichester. In the beginning of 1645 he was made one of the canons of Christchurch, Oxford, and chaplain in ordinary to King Charles I. who was then in that city; and he was also chosen public orator of the university. In 1647 he attended the king in his confinement at Woodburn, Cavenham, Hampton-Court, and the Isle of Wight, where he continued till his majesty's attendants were again put from him. He then returned to Oxford, where he was chosen sub-dean, and continued there till the parliament-victors first ejected him, and then imprisoned him for several weeks in a private house in Oxford. During this confinement he began his Annotations on the New Testament. At the opening of the year 1660, when everything visibly tended to the restoration of the royal family, the doctor was desired by the bishops to repair to London to assist there in the composition of the breaches of the church, his station in which was designed to be the bishopric of Worcester; but on the 4th of April he was seized by a fit of the stone, of which he died on the 25th of that month, aged 55. Besides the above work, he wrote many others; all of which have been published together in four volumes folio.\n\nHAMMOND, Anthony, Esq., an ingenious English poet, descended from a good family of Somerham Place in Huntingdonshire, was born in 1668. After a liberal education at St John's college, Cambridge, he was chosen member of parliament, and soon distinguished himself as a fine speaker. He became a commissioner of the royal navy, which place he quitted in 1712. He published A Miscellany of original Poems by the most eminent hands; in which himself, as appears by the poems marked with his own name, had no inconsiderable share. He wrote the life of Walter Mowle, Esq.; prefixed to his works. He was the intimate friend of that gentleman, and died about the year 1726.\n\nHAMMOND, James, known to the world by the Love-Elegies,\nHampshire. Elegies, which some years after his death, were published by the earl of Chesterfield, was the son of Anthony Hammond above-mentioned, and was preferred to a place about the person of the late prince of Wales, which he held till an unfortunate accident deprived him of his senses. The cause of this calamity was a passion he entertained for a lady, who would not return it; upon which he wrote those love-elegies which have been so much celebrated for their tenderness. The editor observes, that he composed them before he was 21 years of age: a period, says he, when fancy and imagination commonly riot at the expense of judgment and correctness. He was sincere in his love as in his friendship; and wrote to his mistress, as he spoke to his friends, nothing but the genuine sentiments of his heart. Tibullus seems to have been the model our author judiciously preferred to Ovid; the former writing directly from the heart to the heart, the latter too often yielding and addressing himself to the imagination. Mr Hammond died in the year 1743, at Stow, the seat of Lord Cobham, who, as well as the earl of Chesterfield, honoured him with a particular intimacy.\n\nHampshire, or Hants, a county of England, bounded on the west by Dorsetshire and Wiltshire, on the north by Berkshire, on the east by Surrey and Sussex, and on the south by the English channel. It extends 55 miles in length from north to south, and 40 in breadth from east to west, and is about 220 miles in circumference. It is divided into 39 hundreds; and contains 9 forests, 29 parks, one city, 20 market-towns, 253 parishes, above 36,000 houses, and by the most modern computation 180,000 inhabitants, who elect 26 members of parliament, two for the county, two for the city of Winchester, and two for each of the following towns, Southampton, Portsmouth, Petersfield, Yarmouth, Newport, Stockbridge, Andover, Whitechurch, Lymington, Christchurch, and Newton.\n\nThe air is very pure and pleasant, especially upon the downs, on which vast flocks of sheep are kept and bred. In the champaign part of the county, where it is free of wood, the soil is very fertile, producing all kinds of grain. The country is extremely well wooded and watered; for besides many woods on private estates, in which there are vast quantities of well grown timber, there is the New forest of great extent, belonging to the crown, well stored with venerable oak. In these woods and forests, great numbers of hogs run at large and feed on the acorns; and hence it is that the Hampshire bacon so far excels that of most other countries. The rivers are the Avon, Anton, Arle, Teft, Stowre, and Itchin; besides several smaller streams, all abounding in fish, especially trout. As its sea-coast is of a considerable extent, it possesses many good ports and harbours, and is well supplied with salt-water fish. Much honey is produced in the country, and a great deal of mead and metheglin made. Here is also plenty of game, and on the downs is most delightful hunting. The manufacture of cloth and kerseys in this county, though not so extensive as that of some others, is yet far from being inconsiderable, and employs great numbers of the poor, as well as contributes to the enriching of the manufacturers by what is sent abroad. The canal in this county, from Basingstoke to the Wey in Surrey, and from thence to the Thames, cannot but be a great advantage to the county in general, and the parishes in particular; to carry this canal into execution above 86,000l. were raised amongst 150 proprietors in 1789. It extends 53 miles, and was completed in 1796.\n\nNew Hampshire, a province of North America, in New England. It is bounded on the north by Quebec; north-east by the province of Maine; south-east by the Atlantic ocean; south by Massachusetts; west and north-west by Connecticut river, which divides it from Vermont. The shape of New Hampshire resembles an open fan; Connecticut river being the curve, the southern line the shortest, and the eastern line the longest side. It is divided into five counties, viz. Rockingham, Stafford, Hillsborough, Cheshire, Grafton. In 1776, there were 165 settled townships in this state. Since that time the number has been greatly increased. The chief town is Portsmouth. Exeter, 15 miles south-west from Portsmouth, is a pretty town on the south side of Exeter river. And Concord, situated on the west side of Merrimack river, is a pleasant flourishing town, which will probably, on account of its central situation, soon be the permanent seat of government. There are two great rivers, the Piscataqua and the Merrimack. The former has four branches, Berwick, Cocheco, Exeter, and Durham, which are all navigable for small vessels and boats, some 15 others 20 miles from the sea. These rivers unite about eight miles from the mouth of the harbour, and form one broad, deep, rapid stream, navigable for ships of the largest burden. This river forms the only port of New Hampshire. The Merrimack bears that name from its mouth to the confluence of Pemigewasset and Winniffrdkeee rivers; the latter has its source in the lake of the same name. In its course, it receives numberless small streams issuing from ponds and swamps in the valleys. It tumbles over two considerable falls, Amoskeag and Pantucket great falls. From Haverhill the river runs winding along, through a pleasant rich vale of meadow, and padding between Newbury Port and Salisbury, empties itself into the ocean. The land next to the sea is generally low; but as you advance into the country, it rises into hills. Some parts of the slate are mountainous. The White mountains are the highest part of a ridge which extends north-east and south-west to a length not yet ascertained. The whole circuit of them is not less than 50 miles. The height of these mountains above an adjacent meadow, is reckoned to be about 5500 feet, and the meadow is 3500 feet above the level of the sea. The snow and ice cover them nine or ten months in the year; during which time they exhibit that bright appearance from which they are denominated the white mountains. From this summit in clear weather is exhibited a noble view, extending 60 or 70 miles in every direction. Although they are more than 70 miles within land, they are seen many leagues off at sea, and appear like an exceeding bright cloud in the horizon. These immense heights, being copiously replenished with water, afford a variety of beautiful cascades. Three of the largest rivers in New England receive a great part of their waters from these mountains. Ammonoosuck and Israel rivers, two principal branches of Connecticut, fall from their western side. Peabody river, a branch of the Amariscogen, falls...\nHamphire from the north-east side; and almost the whole of the Saco descends from the southern side. The highest summit of these mountains is about latitude 44°.\n\nThe air in New Hampshire is serene and healthful. The weather is not subject to change as in more southern climates. This state, embracing a number of very high mountains, and lying in the neighborhood of others whose towering summits are covered with snow and ice three quarters of the year, is intensely cold in the winter season. The heat of summer is great, but of short duration. The cold braces the constitution, and renders the laboring people healthful and robust.\n\nOn the sea coast, and many places inland, the soil is sandy, but affords good pasturage. The intervals at the foot of the mountains are greatly enriched by the frets, which bring down the soil upon them, forming a fine mould, and producing corn, grain, and herbage, in the most luxuriant plenty. The back lands which have been cultivated are generally very fertile, and produce the various kinds of grain, fruits, and vegetables, which are common to the other parts of New England. The uncultivated lands are covered with extensive forests of pine, fir, cedar, oak, walnut, &c. This state affords all the materials necessary for shipbuilding.\n\nNo actual census of the inhabitants has been lately made. In the convention at Philadelphia, in 1787, they were reckoned at 102,000. There is no characteristic difference between the inhabitants of this and the other New England states. The ancient inhabitants of New Hampshire were emigrants from England. Their posterity, mixed with emigrants from Massachusetts, fill the lower and middle towns. Emigrants from Connecticut compose the largest part of the inhabitants of the western towns adjoining Connecticut river. There are no slaves.

It was named after the right honourable William earl of Dartmouth, who was one of its principal benefactors. It was founded in 1769, for the education and instruction of youth, of the Indian tribes, in reading, writing, and all parts of learning, which should appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and christianizing the children of Pagans, as well as in all liberal arts and sciences, and also of English youths and any others. Its situation, in a frontier country, exposed it during the late war to many inconveniences, which prevented its rapid progress. It flourished, however, amidst all its embarrassments, and is now one of the most growing seminaries in the United States. It has in the four classes about 130 students, under the direction of a president, two professors, and two tutors. It has 12 trustees, who are a body corporate, invested with the powers necessary for such a body. The library is elegant, containing a large collection of the most valuable books. Its apparatus consists of a competent number of useful instruments, for making mathematical and philosophical experiments. There are three buildings for the use of the students. Such is the salubrity of the air, that no instance of mortality has happened among the students since the first establishment of the college.\n\nAt Exeter there is an academy; at Portsmouth a grammar school; and all the towns are bound by law to support schools. The inhabitants of New Hampshire are chiefly congregationalists. The other denominations are Presbyterians, Baptists, and Episcopalians.\n\nThe first discovery made by the English of any part of New Hampshire was in 1614, by Captain John Smith, who ranged the shore from Penobscot to Cape Cod; and in this route discovered the river Piscataqua. On his return to England, he published a description of the country, with a map of the coast, which he presented to Prince Charles, who gave it the name of New England. The first settlement was made in 1623.\n\nNew Hampshire was for many years under the jurisdiction of the governor of Massachusetts, yet they had a separate legislature. They ever bore a proportionable share of the expenses and levies in all enterprises, expeditions, and military exertions, whether planned by the colony or the crown. In every stage of the opposition that was made to the encroachments of the British parliament, the people, who ever had a high sense of liberty, cheerfully bore their part.\n\nHampstead, a pleasant village of Middlesex, four miles northwest of London, stands in a healthy air, on a fine rise, at the top of which is a heath of about a mile every way, that is adorned with several pretty seats, in a most irregular romantic situation, and has a most extensive prospect over London, into the counties all round it, viz. Bucks and Hertfordshire, and even Northamptonshire, Essex, Kent, Surrey, Berks, &c. with an uninterrupted view of Shooter's Hill, Banstead Downs, and Windsor Castle. Its church was anciently a chapel of ease to Hendon, till about 1478. This village used to be referred to formerly for its mineral waters, which have lately been neglected; but the wells are still frequented. It is now crowded with good buildings, even on the very steep of the hill, where there is no walking six yards together without meeting a hillock; but in the reign of Henry VIII. it was chiefly inhabited by the landreces who walked for the Londoners. Its old ruinous church, the lord of the manor's chapel, was lately pulled down, and a new one erected in its room. There is, besides, a handsome chapel near the wells, built by the contribution of the inhabitants, who are chiefly citizens and merchants of London.\n\nHampton, a town of Gloucestershire in England, seated on the Cotswold hills, and had formerly a nunnery.

It is chiefly famous for the royal palace there, which is the finest in Britain. It was built by Cardinal Wolsey, who had 280 silk beds for strangers only, and furnished it richly with gold and silver plate. The buildings, gardens, and the two parks, to which William III. made considerable additions, are about four miles in circumference, and are watered on three sides by the Thames. The inward court, built by King William, forms a piazza, the pillars of which are so low, that it looks more like a cloister than a palace; however, the apartments\nHANSEKÖNEN make ample amends, being extremely magnificent, and more exactly disposed than in any other palace in the world, and adorned with most elegant furniture. Since the accession of his present majesty, however, this palace hath been much neglected, as the king has generally made choice of Windsor for his summer retreat. Those inimitable paintings of Raphael Urbin, called the cartoons, which were placed there by King William, have been removed to the queen's palace at Westminster. For these pieces Louis XV. is said to have offered 100,000l.\n\nHANSEKÖNEN, or HAMESECKEN.

The river divides it into the old and new towns, both of which are fortified. The new town, which was built at first by French and Flemish refugees, who had great privileges granted them, is regular and handsome. The cattle, in which the counts used to reside, and which stands in the old town, is fortified and has a fine flower-garden with commodious apartments, but makes no great appearance. The Jews are tolerated here, and dwell in a particular quarter. The magistracy of the new town, and the disposal of all offices in it, belong to the French and Dutch congregations. Here is an university, with several manufactures, particularly that of roll tobacco, and a very considerable traffic.\n\nE. Long. 9° O. N. Lat. 49° 56'.\n\nHanau-Münzenberg, a county of Germany. The greatest part of it is surrounded by the electorate of Mentz, the bishopric of Fulda, the lordships of Reineck, Ilenburg, and Solms; as also by the territories of Helle-Homburg, Burg-Friedburg, and Frankfort. Its length is near 40 miles, but its greatest breadth not above 12. It is exceeding fertile in corn, wine, and fruits; yielding also salt springs, with some copper, silver, and cobalt. The chief rivers are, the Main, the Kenzig, and the Nidda. The prevailing religion is Calvinism, but Lutherans and Catholics are tolerated. The country is populous, and trade and manufactures flourish in it. In 1736, the whole male line of the counts of Hanau failing in John Reinard, William VIII., landgrave of Helle Cassel, by virtue of a treaty of mutual succession between the families of Hanau and Helle Cassel, took possession of the county, satisfaction having been first made to the house of Saxony for their claims; and in the year 1754, transferred it to Prince William, eldest son to the then hereditary prince Frederic, afterwards landgrave. The revenues of the last count, arising from this and other territories, are said to have amounted to 500,000 florins.

See ANATOMY, n° 53, &c.\n\nThe mechanism of the hand is very curious; excellently contrived to fit it for the various uses and occasions we have for it, and the great number of arts and manufactures it is to be employed in. It consists of a compages of nerves, and little bones joined into each other, which give it a great degree of strength, and at the same time an unusual flexibility, to enable it to handle adjacent bodies, lay hold of them, and grasp them, in order either to draw them toward us or thrust them off.\n\nAnaxagoras is represented by ancient authors as maintaining, that man owes all his wisdom, knowledge, and superiority over other animals, to the use of his hands. Galen represents the matter otherwise; man according to him, is not the wisest creature because he has hands; but he had hands given him because he was the wisest creature; for it was not our hands that taught us arts, but our reason. The hands are the organs of reason, &c.\n\nIn scripture, the word hand was variously applied. To pour water on any one's hand, signifies to serve him. To wash the hands was a ceremony made use of to denote innocence from murder or manslaughter. To kiss the hand was an act of adoration. To fill the hand signified taking possession of the priesthood, and performing its functions. To lean upon any one's hand was a mark of familiarity and superiority. To give the hand signifies to grant peace, swear friendship, promise security, or make alliance. The right hand was the place of honour and respect.—Amongst the Greeks and Romans it was customary for inferiors to walk on the left hand of superiors, that their right hand might be ready to afford protection and defence to their left side, which was, on account of the awkwardness of the left hand, more exposed to danger.\n\nImposition, or laying on of Hands, signifies the conferring of holy orders; a ceremony wherein the hands are laid on the head of another, as a sign of a mission, or of a power given him to exercise the functions of the ministry belonging to the order.\n\nThe apostles began to appoint missionaries by the imposition of hands. See IMPOSITION.\n\nHand, in falconry, is used for the foot of the hawk. To have a clean, strong, slender, glutinous hand, well clawed, are some of the good qualities of a hawk or falcon.\n\nHand, in the manege, sometimes stands for the fore-foot of a horse. It is also used for a division of the horse into two parts with respect to the rider's hand. The fore-hand includes the head, neck, and fore-quarters; the hind-hand is all the rest of the horse.\n\nHand is likewise used for a measure of four inches.\nHandel, George Frederic, a most eminent master and composer of music, was born at Hall, a city of Upper Saxony in Germany. His father was a physician and surgeon of that place, and was upwards of 60 years of age when Handel was born. During his infancy young Handel is said to have amused himself with musical instruments, and to have made considerable progress before he was seven years of age, without any instructions. His propensity for music at last became so strong, that his father, who designed him for the study of the civil law, thought proper to forbid him, even at this early period of life, to touch a musical instrument, and would suffer none to remain in his house. Notwithstanding this prohibition, however, Handel found means to get a little clavichord privately conveyed to a room in the uppermost story of the house, to which room he constantly stole when the family were asleep; and thus made such advances in his art, as enabled him to play on the harpsichord. He was first taken notice of by the duke of Saxe Weissenfels on the following occasion. His father went to pay a visit to another son by a former wife, who was valet de chambre to the duke, and resided at his court. Young Handel, being then in his seventh year, earnestly desired permission to go along with him; but being refused, he followed the chaise on foot, and overtook it, the carriage being probably retarded by the roughness of the way. His father at first chid him for his disobedience, but at last took him into the chaise along with him. While he was in the duke's court, he still continued to show the same inclination for music: it was impossible to keep him from harpsichords; and he used sometimes to get into the organ-loft at church, and play after service was over. On one of these occasions, the duke happening to go out later than usual, found something uncommon in Handel's manner of playing, that he inquired of his valet who it was; and receiving an answer that it was his brother, he desired to see him. This nobleman was so much taken with the musical genius shown by young Handel, that he persuaded his father to let him follow the bent of his inclination. He made the boy a present; and told him, that if he minded his studies, no encouragement should be wanting.\n\nOn his return to Hall, Handel was placed under one Zackaw, the organist of the cathedral church; and our young musician was even then able to supply his master's place in his absence. At nine years of age he began to compose church-services for voices and instruments, and continued to compose one such service every week for three years successively. At the age of 14, he far excelled his master, as he himself owned; and he was sent to Berlin, where he had a relation in some place about the court, on whose care and fidelity his parents could rely. The opera was then in a flourishing condition, being encouraged by the grandfather Handel, of the late king of Prussia, and under the direction of many eminent persons from Italy, among whom were Buononcini and Attilio. Buononcini, being of a haughty disposition, treated Handel with contempt; but Attilio behaved to him with great kindness, and he profited much by his instructions. His abilities soon recommended him to the king, who frequently made him presents, and at last proposed to send him into Italy under his own patronage, and to take him under his immediate protection as soon as his studies should be completed. But Handel's parents not thinking proper to submit their child to the caprice of the king, declined the offer; upon which it became necessary for him to return to Hall.\n\nHandel having now obtained ideas in music far exceeding every thing that could be found in Hall, continued there very unwillingly, and it was resolved to send him into Italy: but as the expense of this journey could not then be spared, he went to Hamburg, where the opera was little inferior to that of Berlin. Soon after his arrival in this city, his father died; and his mother being left in narrow circumstances, her son thought it necessary to procure some scholars, and to accept a place in the orchestra; by which means, instead of being a burden, he became a great relief to her.\n\nAt this time, the first harpsichord in Hamburg was played by one Keiser, a man who also excelled in composition; but he, having involved himself in some debts, was obliged to abscend. Upon this vacancy, the person who had been used to play the second harpsichord claimed the first by right of succession; but was opposed by Handel, who founded a claim to the first harpsichord upon his superior abilities. After much dispute, in which all who supported or directed the opera engaged with much vehemence, it was decided in favour of Handel; but this good success had almost cost him his life. His antagonist resented the supposed affront so much, that, as they were coming out of the orchestra together, he made a push at Handel's breast with a sword, which must undoubtedly have killed him, had there not fortunately been a music-book in the bottom of his coat.\n\nHandel, though yet but in his 15th year, became composer to the house; and the success of Almira, his first opera, was so great, that it ran 30 nights without interruption. Within less than a twelvemonth after this, he set two others, called Florinda and Norene, which were received with the same applause. During his stay here, which was about four or five years, he also composed a considerable number of sonatas, which are now lost. Here his abilities procured him the acquaintance of many persons of note, particularly the prince of Tuscany, brother to John Galton de Medici the grand duke. This prince offered him to go with him to Italy, where he assured him that no convenience would be wanting; but this offer Handel thought proper to decline, being resolved not to give up his independency for any advantage that could be offered him.\n\nIn the 19th year of his age, Handel took a journey to Italy on his own account; where he was received with the greatest kindness by the prince of Tuscany, and had at all times access to the palace of the grand duke.\nHandel, duke. His Serene Highness was impatient to have something composed by so great a master; and notwithstanding the difference between the style of the Italian music and the German, to which Handel had hitherto been accustomed, he set an opera called *Rodrigo*, which pleased so well, that he was rewarded with 100 sequins and a service of plate. After staying about a year in Florence, he went to Venice, where he is said to have been first discovered at a masquerade. He was playing on a harpsichord in his villa when Scarlatti, a famous performer, cried out, that the person who played could be none but the famous Saxon or the devil. But a story similar to this is reported of many eminent persons whose abilities have been discovered in disguise. Here he composed his opera called *Agrippina*, which was performed 27 nights successively, with the most extravagant applause.\n\nFrom Venice our musician proceeded to Rome, where he became acquainted with Cardinal Ottoboni and many other dignitaries of the church, by which means he was frequently attacked on account of his religion; but Handel declared he would live and die in the religion in which he had been educated, whether it was true or false. Here he composed an oratorio called *Resurrectione*, and 150 cantatas, besides some sonatas, and other music. Ottoboni also contrived to have a trial of skill between him and Dominici Scarlatti, who was considered as the greatest master on that instrument in Italy. The event is differently reported. Some say that Scarlatti was victorious, and others give the victory to Handel; but when they came to the organ, Scarlatti himself ascribed the superiority to Handel.\n\nFrom Rome, Handel went to Naples; after which, he paid a second visit to Florence, and at last, having spent six years in Italy, set out for his native country. In his way thither, he was introduced at the court of Hanover with so much advantage by the baron Kilmanfeck, that his Electoral Highness offered him a pension of 1500 crowns a-year as an inducement for him to continue there. This generous offer he declined on account of his having promised to visit the court of the Elector Palatine, and likewise to come over to England in compliance with the repeated invitations of the duke of Manchester. The elector, however, being made acquainted with this objection, generously ordered him to be told, that his acceptance of the pension should neither restrain him from his promise nor resolution; but that he should be at full liberty to be absent a year or more if he chose it, and to go wherever he thought fit. Soon after, the place of master of the chapel was bestowed upon Handel; and our musician having visited his mother, who was now extremely aged and blind, and his old master Zackaw, and paid some time at the court of the Elector Palatine, set out for England, where he arrived in 1710.\n\nAt that time operas were a new entertainment in England, and were conducted in a very absurd manner; but Handel soon put them on a better footing; and set a drama called *Rinaldo*, which was performed with uncommon success. Having laid a year in England, he returned to Hanover; but in 1712 he again came over to England; and the peace of Utrecht being concluded a few months afterwards, he composed a grand *Te Deum* and *Jubilate* on the occasion. He now found the nobility very desirous that he should resume the direction of the opera-house in the Hay Market; and the queen having added her authority to their solicitations, and conferred on him a pension of 200l. a-year, he forgot his engagements to the elector of Hanover, and remained in Britain till the death of the queen in 1714. On the arrival of King George I., Handel, conscious of his ill behaviour, durst not appear at court; but he was extricated from his dilemma by the baron Kilmanfeck. Having engaged several of the English nobility in his behalf, the baron persuaded the king to a party of pleasure on the water. Handel was apprised of the design, and ordered to prepare some music for the occasion. This he executed with the utmost attention, and on the day appointed it was performed and conducted by himself. The king with pleasure and surprize inquired where it was, and how the entertainment came to be provided without his knowledge. The baron then produced the delinquent; and asked leave to present him to his majesty as one too sensible of his fault to attempt an excuse, but sincerely desirous to atone for it. This intercession was accepted. Handel was restored to favour, his water music was honoured with the highest approbation, and the king added a pension of 200l. a-year to that formerly bestowed on him by Queen Anne; which he soon after increased to 400l. on his being appointed to teach the young princesses music.\n\nIn the year 1715, Handel composed his opera of *Acadagio*; but from that time to the year 1720 he composed only *Teseo* and *Pastor Fido*, Buononcini and Attilio being then composers for the operas. About this time a project was formed by the nobility for erecting a kind of academy at the Hay Market, with a view to secure to themselves a constant supply of operas to be composed by Handel, and performed under his direction. No less than 50,000l. was subscribed for this scheme, of which the king himself subscribed 1000l. and it was proposed to continue the undertaking for 14 years. Handel went over to Dresden, in order to engage fingers, and returned with Seneffino and Duranti. Buononcini and Attilio had still a strong party in their favour, but not equal to that of Handel; and therefore in 1720 he obtained leave to perform his opera of *Radamisto*. The house was so crowded, that many fainted through excessive heat; and 40s. were offered for some for a seat in the gallery, after having vainly attempted to get one elsewhere. The contention, however, still ran very high between Handel's party and that of the two Italian masters; and at last it was determined that the rivals should be jointly employed in making an opera, in which each should take a distinct act, and he who by the general suffrage was allowed to have given the best proof of his abilities should be put in possession of the house. This opera was called *Muzio Scævola*, and Handel set the last act. It is said that Handel's superiority was owned even in the overture before it; but when the act came to be performed, there remained no pretence of doubt or dispute. The academy was now therefore firmly established, and Handel conducted it for nine years with great success; but about that time an irreconcilable enmity took place between Handel himself and Seneffino. Seneffino accused Handel of tyranny, and Handel accused Seneffino of rebellion. The merits of the quarrel are not known:\nHandel, known: the nobility, however, became mediators for some time; and having failed in that good design, they became parties in the quarrel. Handel was resolved to dismiss Senefino, and the nobility seemed also resolved not to permit him to do so. The haughtiness of Handel's temper would not allow him to yield, and the affair ended in the total dissolution of the academy.\n\nHandel now found that his abilities, great as they were, could not support him against the powerful opposition he met with. After the dismissal of Senefino, his audience sensibly dwindled away, and Handel entered into an agreement with Mr Heidegger to carry on operas in conjunction with him. New fingers were engaged from Italy; but the offended nobility raised a subscription against him, to carry on operas in the playhouse in Lincoln's-Inn fields. Handel bore up four years against this opposition; three in partnership with Heidegger, and one by himself; but though his musical abilities were superior to those of his antagonists, the astonishing powers of the voice of Farinelli, whom the opposite party had engaged, determined the victory against him. At last Handel, having spent all he was worth in a fruitless opposition, thought proper to desist. His disappointment had such an effect upon him, that for some time he was disordered in his understanding, and at the same time his right arm was rendered useless by a stroke of the palsy. In this deplorable situation, it was thought necessary that he should go to the baths of Aix-la-Chapelle; and from them he received such extraordinary and sudden relief, that his cure was looked upon by the nuns as miraculous.\n\nIn 1736, Handel again returned to England; and soon after his return his Alexander's Feast was performed with applause at Covent Garden. The success and splendor of the Hay Market was by this time so much reduced by repeated mismanagements, that Lord Middlesex undertook the direction of it himself, and once more applied to Handel for composition. He accordingly composed two operas called Rameau, and Alessandro Severo, for which in 1737 he received 1000l. In 1738, he received 1500l. from a single benefit, and nothing seemed wanting to retrieve his affairs, excepting such concessions on his part as his opponents had a right to expect. These concessions, however, he could not be prevailed upon to make; and that he might no longer be under obligations to act as he was directed by others, he refused to enter into any engagements upon subscription. After having tried a few more operas at Covent Garden without success, he introduced another species of music called oratorios, which he thought better suited to the native gravity of an English audience. But as the subjects of these pieces were always taken from sacred history, it was by some thought to be a profanation to set them to music and perform them at a playhouse. In consequence of this prejudice, the oratorios met with very indifferent success; and in 1741 Mr Handel found his affairs in such a bad situation, that he was obliged to quit England, and go to Dublin.\n\nHe was received in Ireland in a manner suitable to his great merit; and his performing his oratorio called the Messiah, for the benefit of the city prison, brought him into universal favour. In nine months time he had brought his affairs into a better situation; and on his return to England in 1742, he found the public much more favourably disposed. His oratorios were now performed with great applause; his Messiah, which before had been but coldly received, became a favourite performance; and Handel, with a generous humanity, determined to perform it annually for the benefit of the founding hospital, which at that time was only supported by private benefactions. In 1743, he had a return of his paralytic disorder; and in 1751 became quite blind by a gutta serena in his eyes. This last misfortune for some time sunk him into the deepest depression; but at last he was obliged to acquiesce in his situation, after having without any relief undergone some very painful operations. Finding it now impossible to manage his oratorios alone, he was assisted by Mr Smith, who at his request frequently played for him, and conducted them in his stead; and with this assistance they were continued till within eight days of his death. During the latter part of his life, his mind was often disordered; yet at times it appears to have resumed its full vigour, and he composed several songs, choruses, &c. which from their dates may be considered almost as the last sounds of his dying voice. From about October 1758 his health declined very fast; his appetite, which had been remarkably keen, and which he had gratified to a great degree, left him; and he became sensible of the approach of death. On the 6th of April 1759, his last oratorio was performed, at which he was present, and died on the 14th of the same month. On the 20th he was buried by the right reverend Dr Pearce, bishop of Rochester, in Westminster abbey; where, by his own order, and at his own expense, a monument was erected to his memory.\n\nWith regard to the character of this most eminent musician, he is universally allowed to have been a great epicure: In his temper he was very haughty, but was seldom or never guilty of mean actions. His pride was uniform: he was not by turns a tyrant and a slave. He appears to have had a most extravagant love for liberty and independence; infomuch, that he would, for the sake of liberty, do things otherwise the most prejudicial to his own interest. He was liberal even when poor, and remembered his former friends when he was rich. His musical powers can perhaps be best expressed by Arbuthnot's reply to Pope, who fervently asked his opinion of him as a musician; \"Conceive (said he) the highest you can of his abilities, and they are much beyond anything you can conceive.\"\n\n- Commemoration of Handel; a musical exhibition instituted some years ago, and the grandest of the kind ever attempted in any nation. Of the rise and progress of the design, together with the manner in which the first celebration was executed, an accurate and authentic detail is given, as might be expected, by Dr Burney in the 4th and last volume of his History of Music, from which the following account is extracted.\n\n\"In a conversation between lord viscount Fitzwilliam, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, and Joah Bates, Esq. commissioner of the victualling-office, the beginning of last year, 1783, at the house of the latter; after remarking that the number of eminent musical performers of all kinds, both vocal and instrumental, with\nHandel, with which London abounded, was far greater than in any other city of Europe; it was lamented that there was no public periodical occasion for collecting and consolidating them into one band; by which means a performance might be exhibited on so grand and magnificent a scale as no other part of the world could equal. The birth and death of Handel naturally occurred to three such enthusiastic admirers of that great master; and it was immediately recollected, that the next year (1784) would be a proper time for the introduction of such a custom, as it formed a complete century since his birth, and an exact quarter of a century since his decease.\n\n\"The plan was soon after communicated to the governors of the Musical Fund, who approved it, and promised their assistance. It was next submitted to the directors of the concert of Ancient Music; who, with an alacrity which does honour to their zeal for the memory of the great artist Handel, voluntarily undertook the trouble of managing and directing the celebrity. At length, the design coming to the knowledge of the king, it was honoured with his majesty's sanction and patronage. Westminster Abbey, where the bones of the great musician were deposited, was thought the proper place for the performance; and application having been made to the bishop of Rochester for the use of it, his lordship finding that the scheme was honoured with the patronage of his majesty, readily consented; only requesting, as the performance would interfere with the annual benefit for the Westminster Infirmary, that part of the profits might be appropriated to that charity, as an indemnification for the loss it would sustain. To this the projectors of the plan acceded; and it was afterwards settled, that the profits of the first day's performance should be equally divided between the Musical Fund and the Westminster Infirmary; and those of the subsequent days be solely applied to the use of that fund which Handel himself so long helped to sustain, and to which he not only bequeathed a thousand pounds, but which almost every musician in the capital annually contributes his money, his performance, or both, to support. Application was next made to Mr James Wyatt, the architect, to furnish plans for the necessary decorations of the abbey; drawings of which having been shown to his majesty, were approved. The general idea was to produce the effect of a royal musical chapel, with the orchestra terminating one end, and the accommodation for the royal family, the other. The arrangement of the performance of each day was next settled; and it was at his majesty's instigation that the celebrity was extended to three days instead of two, which he thought would not be sufficient for the display of Handel's powers, or fulfilling the charitable purposes to which it was intended to devote the profits. It was originally intended to have celebrated this festival on the 26th, 22d, and 23d of April; and the 20th being the day of the funeral of Handel, part of the music was, in some measure, so selected as to apply to that incident. But, in consequence of the sudden dissolution of parliament, it was thought proper to defer the festival to the 26th, 27th, and 29th of May, which seems to have been for its advantage; as many persons of tender constitutions, who ventured to go to Westminster Abbey in warm weather, would not have had the courage to go thither in cold. Impressed with a reverence for the memory of Handel, no sooner was the project known, but most of the practical musicians in the kingdom eagerly manifested their zeal for the enterprise; and many of the most eminent professors, waving all claims to precedence in the band, offered to perform in any subordinate station in which their talents could be most useful.\n\n\"In order to render the band as powerful and complete as possible, it was determined to employ every species of instrument that was capable of producing grand effects in a great orchestra and spacious building. Among these the sackbut, or double trumpet, was sought; but so many years had elapsed since it had been used in this kingdom, that neither the instrument, nor a performer upon it, could easily be found. It was, however, discovered, after much useless inquiry, not only here, but by letter, on the continent, that in his majesty's military band there were six musicians who played the three several species of sackbut, tenor, bass, and double bass.\n\n\"The double bassoon, which was so conspicuous in the orchestra, and powerful in its effect, is likewise a tube of 16 feet. It was made, with the approbation of Mr Handel, by Stainby the flute maker, for the coronation of his late majesty George II. The late ingenious Mr Lampe, author of the justly admired music of The Dragon of Wantley, was the person intended to perform on it; but, for want of a proper reed, or for some other cause, at present unknown, no use was made of it at that time; nor indeed, though it has been often attempted, was it ever introduced into any band in England, till now, by the ingenuity and perseverance of Mr Ashby of the Guards.\n\n\"The double-bass kettle-drums were made from models of Mr Ashbridge, of Drury Lane orchestra, in copper, it being impossible to procure plates of brass large enough. The Tower drums, which, by permission of his grace the duke of Richmond, were brought to the abbey on this occasion, are those which belong to the ordnance stores, and were taken by the duke of Marlborough at the battle of Malplaquet in 1709. These are hemispherical, or a circle divided; but those of Mr Ashbridge are more cylindrical, being much longer, as well as more capacious, than the common kettle-drum; by which he accounts for the superiority of their tone to that of all other drums. These three species of kettle drums, which may be called tenor, bass, and double bass, were an octave below each other.\n\n\"The excellent organ, erected at the west end of the abbey for the commemoration performances only, is the workmanship of the ingenious Mr Samuel Green in Islington. It was fabricated for the cathedral of Canterbury; but before its departure, for the place of its destination, it was permitted to be opened in the capital on this memorable occasion. The keys of communication with the harpsichord, at which Mr Bates the conductor was seated, extended 19 feet from the body of the organ, and 20 feet 7 inches below the perpendicular of the set of keys by which it is usually played. Similar keys were first contrived in this country for Handel himself at his oratorios; but to convey...\"\nthem to so great a distance from the instrument, without rendering the touch impracticably heavy, required uncommon ingenuity and mechanical resources.\n\n\"In celebrating the disposition, discipline, and effects of this most numerous and excellent band, the merit of the admirable architect, who furnished the elegant designs for the orchestra and galleries, must not be forgotten; as, when filled, they constituted one of the grandest and most magnificent spectacles which imagination can delineate. All the preparations for receiving their majesties, and the first personages in the kingdom, at the east end; upwards of 500 musicians at the west; and the public in general, to the number of between 3000 and 4000 persons, in the area and galleries; so wonderfully corresponded with the style of architecture of this venerable and beautiful structure, that there was nothing visible either for use or ornament, which did not harmonize with the principal tone of the building, and which may not metaphorically have been said to have been in perfect tune with it. But, besides the wonderful manner in which this construction exhibited the band to the spectators, the orchestra was so judiciously contrived, that almost every performer, both vocal and instrumental, was in full view of the conductor and leader; which accounts, in some measure, for the uncommon ease with which the performers executed their parts.\n\n\"At the east end of the aisle, just before the back of the choir-organ, some of the pipes of which were visible below, a throne was erected in a beautiful Gothic style, corresponding with that of the abbey, and a centre box, richly decorated and furnished with crimson satin, fringed with gold, for the reception of their majesties and the royal family: on the right hand of which was a box for the bishops, and on the left, one for the dean and chapter of Westminster; immediately below these two boxes were two others, one on the right for the families and friends of the directors, and the other for those of the prebendaries of Westminster. Immediately below the king's box was placed one for the directors themselves, who were all distinguished by white wands tipped with gold, and gold medals, struck on the occasion, appending from white ribbands. These their majesties likewise condescended to wear at each performance. Behind, and on each side of the throne, there were seats for their majesties suite, maids of honour, grooms of the bed-chamber, pages, &c.—The orchestra was built at the opposite extremity, ascending regularly from the height of seven feet from the floor to upwards of forty from the base of the pillars, and extending from the centre to the top of the side aisle.—The intermediate space below was filled up with level benches, and appropriated to the early subscribers. The said aisles were formed into long galleries ranging with the orchestra, and ascending so as to contain 12 rows on each side; the fronts of which projected before the pillars, and were ornamented with festoons of crimson morine.—At the top of the orchestra was placed the occasional organ, in a Gothic frame, mounting to, and mingling with, the saints and martyrs represented in the painted glads on the west window. On each side of the organ, close to the window, were placed the kettle-drums described above. The choral bands were principally placed in view of Mr Bates, on steps seemingly ascending into the clouds, in each of the side aisles, as their termination was invisible to the audience. The principal fingers were ranged in the front of the orchestra, as at oratories, accompanied by the choirs of St Paul, the abbey, Windsor, and the chapel royal.\n\n\"Few circumstances will perhaps more astonish veteran musicians, than to be informed, that there was but one general rehearsal for each day's performance: an indisputable proof of the high state of cultivation to which practical music is at present arrived in this country; for if good performers had not been found ready made, a dozen rehearsals would not have been sufficient to make them so. Indeed, Mr Bates, in examining the list of performers, and inquiring into their several merits, suggested the idea of what he called a drilling rehearsal, at Tottenham-street concert-room, a week before the performance; in order to hear such volunteers, particularly chorus fingers, as were but little known to himself, or of whose abilities his assistant was unable to speak with certainty. At this rehearsal, though it consisted of 120 performers, not more than two of that number were desired not to attend any more.\n\n\"At the general rehearsal in the abbey, mentioned above, more than 500 persons found means to obtain admission, in spite of every endeavour to shut out all but the performers; for fear of interruption, and perhaps of failure in the first attempts at incorporating and consolidating such a numerous band, consisting not only of all the regulars, both native and foreign, which the capital could furnish, but of all the irregulars, that is, dilettanti, and provincial musicians of character, who could be muttered, many of whom had never heard or seen each other before. This intrusion, which was very much to the dissatisfaction of the managers and conductor, suggested the idea of turning the eagerness of the public to some profitable account for the charity, by fixing the price of admission to half a guinea for each person.\n\n\"But, besides the profits derived from subsequent rehearsals, the consequences of the first were not without their use; for the pleasure and astonishment of the audience, at the small mistakes, and great effects of this first experiment, which many had condemned by anticipation, were soon communicated to the lovers of music throughout the town, to the great increase of subscribers and solicitors for tickets. For though the friends of the directors were early in subscribing, perhaps from personal respect, as much as expectation of a higher musical repartee than usual; yet the public in general did not manifest great eagerness in securing tickets till after this rehearsal, Friday May 21, which was reported to have astonished even the performers themselves by its correctness and effects. But so interesting did the undertaking become by this favourable rumour, that from the great demand of tickets it was found necessary to close the subscription.\n\n\"Many families, as well as individuals, were attracted to the capital by this celebrity; and it was never remembered to have been so full, except at the coronation of his present majesty. Many of the performers came, unsolicited, from the remotest parts of the kingdom at their own expense: some of them, however, were afterwards reimbursed, and had a small gratuity in consideration of the time they were kept...\"\nHandel from their families by the two unexpected additional performances.\n\n\"Foreigners, particularly the French, must be much astonished at so numerous a band moving in such exact measure, without the assistance of a coryphaeus to beat the time, either with a roll of paper, or a noisy haton or truncheon. Rousseau says, that 'the more time is beaten, the less it is kept;' and it is certain, that when the measure is broken, the fury of the musical general or director, increasing with the disobedience and confusion of his troops, he becomes more violent, and his strokes and gesticulations more ridiculous, in proportion to their disorder.\n\n\"As this commemoration is not only the first instance of a band of such magnitude being assembled together, but of any band at all numerous, performing in a similar situation, without the assistance of a conductor to regulate the measure, the performances in Westminster abbey may be safely pronounced no less remarkable for the multiplicity of voices and instruments employed, than for accuracy and precision. When all the wheels of that huge machine, the orchestra, were in motion, the effect resembled clock-work in every thing but want of feeling and expression. And as the power of gravity and attraction in bodies is proportioned to their mass and density, so it seems as if the magnitude of this band had commanded and impelled adhesion and obedience beyond that of any other of inferior force. The pulsations in every limb, and ramifications of veins and arteries in an animal, could not be more reciprocal, isochronous, and under the regulation of the heart, than the members of this body of musicians under that of the conductor and leader. The totality of sound seemed to proceed from one voice and one instrument; and its powers produced not only new and exquisite sensations in judges and lovers of the art, but were felt by those who never received pleasure from music before. These effects, which will be long remembered by the present public, perhaps to the disadvantage of all other choral performances, run the risk of being doubted by all but those who heard them, and the present description of being pronounced fabulous, if it should survive the present generation.\"\n\nHANDSPIKE, or HANDSPEC, a wooden bar used as a lever to heave about the windlass, in order to draw up the anchor from the bottom, particularly in merchant ships. The handle is round and tapering, and the other end is square, to conform to the shape of the holes in the windlass. It is also employed as a lever on many other occasions, as flowing the anchors, provisions, or cargo, in the ship's hold. The gunner's handspike is shorter and flatter than the above, and armed with two claws for managing the artillery, &c.\n\nHANG-TCHOO-FOO, the capital of the province of Tche-Kiang in China, is situated between the basin of the grand canal, and the river Chou-tang-chuang, which falls into the sea about 60 miles to the eastward, and in N. Lat. 30° 21'. E. Long. 126° 20'. Hang-tchoo-foo exports and receives vast quantities of merchandise to and from the southern provinces by means of this river. There is no communication by water between the river and the basin of the grand canal, in consequence of which all goods brought by sea into the river from the southward, must be landed at this city, in their way to the north. Its population is immense, being computed to be nearly as numerous as in Pekin, which contains about 3,000,000 of inhabitants. The houses are low, none exceeding two stories; and the streets, the middle of which is paved with smooth flags, and the sides with small flat stones, are very narrow. The principal streets contain nothing but shops and warehouses, many of which are equally splendid with those of the kind in London. Sir George Staunton informs us, that it is extremely difficult to pass along the streets, on account of the prodigious numbers of people, all engaged in their own concerns. Several men, but no women, attend in these shops behind the counters. The women are employed in the manufacture of silk, every part of which is done by them alone. In their dress they are not regulated by fancy or fashion, but by what is conducive to health, and the season of the year. Even among the ladies, there is little variety in their dress, except in the disposition of the ornaments of the head. The fair sex esteem comeliness in a man to be a beauty, but they aim at preserving a delicacy of shape as to themselves. They allow their nails to grow, and reduce their eyebrows to an arched line.\n\nThe natural and artificial beauties of the lake of Hang-tchoo-foo, in the opinion of Barrow, far exceeded any thing which he had the opportunity of seeing in the vast empire of China. The surrounding mountains are highly picturesque, and the valleys covered with trees of various kinds, among which are the laurus camphora, croton jubiflorum, and thuya orientalis. In the middle of the lake are two islands, to which company generally resort after having amused themselves with rowing, and in which a temple and several pleasure-houses have been built for their reception. The emperor has a small palace in the neighbourhood. This city has a garrison of 3000 Chinese, under the command of the viceroy, and 3000 Tartars, commanded by a general of the same nation. It has under its jurisdiction seven cities of the second and third class.\n\nHANGING, a common name given to the method of inflicting death on criminals by suspending them by the neck.—Physicians are not agreed as to the manner in which death is brought on by hanging. De Haen hanged three dogs, which he afterwards opened. In one, nothing remarkable appeared in the lungs. In another, from whom half an ounce of blood was taken from the jugular vein, the dura and pia mater were of the natural appearance; but the lungs were much inflamed. In the third, the meninges were found, and there was no effusion of blood in the ventricles of the brain, but the left lobe of the lungs was turgid with blood. Wepfer, Littreus, Alberti, Bruhierius, and Boerhaave, affirm that hanged animals die apoplectic. Their arguments for this are chiefly drawn from the livid colour of the face; from the turgescence of the vessels of the brain; the inflammation of the eyes; and from the sparks of fire which those who have survived hanging allege they have seen before their eyes. On the contrary, Bonetus, Petit, Haller, and Lancisi, from observing that death is occasioned by any small body falling into the glottis, have ascribed it to the stoppage of respiration. Others, deeming both these causes ill-founded, have ascribed it to a luxation of the vertebrae of the neck.—De Haen adduces the authority of many eminent authors to prove the possibility of recovering hanged persons; and observes, in general,\nHANGINGS denote any kind of drapery hung up against the walls or wainscoting of a room.\n\nPaper-Hangings. See Paper-Hangings.\n\nWove Hangings. See Tapestry.\n\nHANOCLIFF, a remarkable point of land on the east coast of the largest of the Shetland islands. It is frequently the first land seen by ships in northern voyages. Captain Phipps determined its situation to be in W. Long. 6° 30' N. Lat. 60° 9'.\n\nHANNIBAL, a famous Carthaginian general, of whose exploits an account is given under the articles Carthage and Rome. After having had the misfortune to lose a sea-fight with the Rhodians, through the cowardice of Apollonius one of the admirals of Antiochus the Great, he was forced to fly into Crete, to avoid falling into the hands of the Romans. On his arrival in this island, he took sanctuary among the Gortynii; but as he had brought great treasure along with him, and knew the avance of the Cretans, he thought proper to secure his riches by the following stratagem. He filled several vessels with melted lead, just covering them over with gold and silver. These he deposited in the temple of Diana, in the presence of the Gortynii, with whom, he said, he trusted all his treasure: Justin tells us, that he left this with them as a security for his good behaviour, and lived for some time very quietly in these parts. He took care, however, to conceal his riches in hollow statues of brass; which, according to some, he always carried along with him; or, as others will have it, exposed in a public place as things of little value. At last he retired to the court of Prusias king of Bithynia, where he found means to unite several of the neighbouring states with that prince in a confederacy against Eumenes king of Pergamus, a professed friend to the Romans; and during the ensuing war gave Eumenes several defeats, more through the force of his own genius than the valour of his troops. The Romans having received intelligence of the important services performed by Hannibal, immediately dispatched T. Quintius Flamininus as an ambassador to Prusias, in order to procure his destruction. At his first audience, he complained of the protection given to that famous general; representing him \"as the most inveterate and implacable enemy the Romans ever had; as one who had ruined both his own country and Antiochus, by drawing them into a destructive war with Rome.\"—Prusias, in order to ingratiate himself with the Romans, immediately sent a party of soldiers to surround Hannibal's house, that he might find it impossible to make his escape. The Carthaginian, having before discovered that no confidence was to be repose in Prusias, had contrived seven secret passages from his house, in order to evade the machinations of his enemies, even if they should carry their point at the Bithynian court. But guards being posted at these, he could not fly, though, according to Livy, he attempted it. Perceiving, therefore, no possibility of escaping, he had recourse to poison, which he had long reserved for such a melancholy occasion. Then taking it in his hand, \"Let us (said he) deliver the Romans from the difficulty with which they have long been tortured, Hannibal, since they have not patience to wait for an old man's death. Flamininus will not acquire any reputation or glory by a victory gained over a betrayed and defenceless person. This single day will be a lasting testimony of the degeneracy of the Romans. Their ancestors gave Pyrrhus intelligence of a design to poison him, that he might guard against the impending danger, even when he was at the head of a powerful army in Italy; but they have deputed a person of consular dignity to excite Prusias impiously to murder one who has taken refuge in his dominions, in violation of the laws of hospitality.\" Then having denounced dreadful imprecatations against Prusias, he drank the poison, and expired at the age of 70 years.\n\nCornelius Nepos acquaints us, that he put an end to his life by a subtle poison which he carried about with him in a ring. Plutarch relates, that, according to some writers, he ordered a servant to strangle him with a cloak wrapped about his neck; and others say, that, in imitation of Midas and Themistocles, he drank bull's blood.\n\nWith respect to the character of this general, it appears to have been in military affairs what Demosthenes was in oratory, or Newton in mathematics; namely, absolutely perfect, in which no human wisdom could discover a fault, and to which no man could add a perfection. Rollin hath contrasted his character with that of Scipio Africanus. He enumerates the qualities which make a complete general; and having then given a summary of what historians have related concerning both commanders, is inclined to give the preference to Hannibal. \"There are, however (he says), two difficulties which hinder him from deciding; one drawn from the characters of the generals whom Hannibal vanquished; the other from the errors he committed. May it not be said (continues our author), that those victories which made Hannibal so famous, were as much owing to the imprudence and temerity of the Roman generals, as to his bravery and skill? When a Fabius and a Scipio were sent against him, the former stopped his progress, the latter conquered him.\"\n\nThese reasons have been answered by Mr Hooke, who hath taken some pains to vindicate Hannibal's character, by fully and fairly comparing it with that of Scipio Africanus, and other Roman commanders. \"I do not see (says he) why these difficulties should check our author's inclination to declare in favour of the Carthaginian. That Fabius was not beaten by Hannibal, we cannot much wonder, when we remember how steadily the old man kept to his resolution never to fight with him. But from Fabius's taking this method to put a stop to the victories of the enemy, may we not conclude that he knew no other, and thought Hannibal an overmatch for him? And why does our author forget Publius Scipio (Africanus's father), a prudent and able general, whom Hannibal vanquished at the Ticin? Livy relates some victories of Hannibal over the celebrated Marcellus; but neither Marcellus nor any other general ever vanquished Hannibal before the battle of Zama, if we may believe Polybius (lib. xv. c. 16.) Terentius Varro, indeed, is represented as a headstrong rash man; but the battle of Cannae was not lost by his imprudence. The order\nHannibal order in which he drew up his army is nowhere condemned; and Chevalier Polard thinks it excellent.\n\nAnd as to the conduct of the battle, Æmilius Paulus, a renowned captain, and a disciple of Fabius, had a greater share in it than his colleague. The imprudence with which Varro is taxed, was his venturing, contrary to his colleague's advice, with above 90,000 men, to encounter in a plain field an enemy who had only 50,000, but was superior in horse. And does not the very advice of Æmilius, and the charge of temerity on Varro for not following it, imply a confession of Hannibal's superiority in military skill over Æmilius as well as Varro?\n\nIt ought likewise to be observed, that Hannibal's infantry had gained the victory over the Roman infantry, before this latter suffered any thing from the Carthaginian cavalry. It was otherwise when Scipio gained the victory at Zama. His infantry would probably have been vanquished but for his cavalry. Hannibal, with only his third line of foot (his Italian army), maintained a long fight against Scipio's three lines of foot; and seems to have had the advantage over them, when Matinilla and Laelius, with the horde, came to their assistance. Polybius indeed says, that Hannibal's Italian forces were equal in number to all Scipio's infantry; but this is contradicted by Livy, and is not very probable. The authority of Polybius, who was an intimate friend of Scipio Æmilianus, is, I imagine, of little weight in matters where the glory of the Scipios is particularly concerned. His partiality and flattery to them are, in many instances, but too visible.\"\n\nOur author then proceeds to show, that Hannibal was not guilty of any of the faults laid to his charge as a general; and having contrasted the moral characters of the two generals with each other, makes it evident, that as a man, as well as a general, Hannibal had greatly the advantage of his rival. See Hooke's Roman History, vol. iv. p. 151, et seq.\n\nHANNO, general of the Carthaginians, was commanded to sail round Africa. He entered the ocean through the straits of Gibraltar, and discovered several countries. He would have continued his navigation, had it not been for want of provisions. He wrote an account of his voyage, which was often quoted, but not much credited. Sigismund Gelenius published it in Greek at Basle, by Frobenius, in 1533. He lived, according to Pliny, when the affairs of the Carthaginians were in the most flourishing condition; but this is a very indeterminate expression.\n\nHANOVER, an electoral state of Germany, of which the king of Great Britain is elector.—Though the house of Hanover is the last that has been raised to the electoral dignity in the empire, it may vie with any in Germany for the antiquity and nobleness of its family. It is likewise very considerable for the extent of its territories, which at present age, the Duchy of Calenberg, in which are the cities of Hanover, Calenberg, Hamelen, Neufeldt, Gottingen, &c.; the duchy of Grubenhagen, the county of Diepholtz, the county of Illoa, in the bishopric of Hildesheim; the bailiages of Coldingen, Luther, Badenburg, and Wetterthoven, with the right of protection of the city of Hildesheim; and the county of Danneberg, ceded by the dukes of Wolfenbuttle to the dukes of Lunenburg, as an equivalent for their pretensions on the city of Brunswic. The elector possesses likewise the county Hanover, of Delmenhorst, and the duchies of Bremen and Verden, sold by the king of Denmark in 1715: the right of possessing alternately the bishopric of Osnabruck belongs solely to the electoral branch; but if it shall happen to fail, the dukes of Wolfenbuttle are to enjoy the same right. This electorate has no navy, but a considerable marine on the great rivers Elbe and Weser.\n\nIn consideration of the great services performed by Ernest Augustus, duke of Brunswic-Hanover, in the wars which the emperor Leopold had with Louis XIV., that emperor conferred the dignity of an elector of the holy Roman empire upon him and his heirs male, of which he received the investiture on the 19th of December 1692. This new creation met with great opposition both in the electoral college and the college of princes: at last, by a conclusion of the three colleges on the 30th of January 1708, it was unanimously determined, that the electoral dignity should be confirmed to the duke of Hanover and his heirs male; but it was added, that if, while that electoral dignity subsisted, the Palatine electorate should happen to fall into the hands of a Protestant prince, the first Catholic elector should have a supernumerary vote.\n\nThe princes of this house have their seat in the college of princes, immediately after those of the electoral houses; each branch having a vote. The elector, besides his seat in the electoral college, was invested with the office of arch standard-bearer of the empire; but this being disputed with him by the duke of Wirtemberg, the elector Palatine having obtained the office of arch-steward, yielded that of arch-treasurer to the elector of Hanover, who was confirmed in this dignity by a decree of the diet of the 13th of January 1710.\n\nThe sovereign power is administered by the lords of the regency appointed by the elector. Throughout all the provinces they possess a considerable share of freedom, the people being represented in the assemblies of the states. No government can be more mild; and an air of content is spread over all the inhabitants. The Conseil Intime, the High Court of Justice, and the Regency, are the principal courts of justice; besides which, every province has its municipal administration with the inferior divisions into bailiwicks, &c. The police is excellent, and justice fairly administered. The elector enjoys the right de non appellando in all criminal affairs, but in civil processes only as far as 2000 florins.\n\nLutheranism is the established religion; but all others enjoy a perfect toleration, and are publicly exercised. Difference in religious sentiments here gives no interruption to that harmony which should subsist among fellow citizens. There are 750 Lutheran parishes, 14 Reformed communities, a Romish college, a convent, and some Catholic churches.\n\nLiterature is in a very advanced state throughout these dominions. The university of Gottingen is deservedly celebrated; and contains about 800 students of different nations, and 60 professors. There are besides several colleges, and a number of well-established schools, throughout the electorate. In general, education is much attended to.\n\nAlthough there are various tracts of heath and marshy\nmarily ground, the soil in general produces abundance of corn, fruits, hemp, flax, tobacco, madder, and some wine. There are several large salt-works. A good deal of cattle are reared, and a great number of excellent horses. Most metals and minerals are found here. The forests furnish sufficient timber, and large quantities of pitch and tar. The natural productions of the electorate furnish ample materials for commerce, so as to prevent the balance being against them, although their manufactures are not sufficient for consumption. Cattle, horses, salt, wrought iron, and fuel, are principal articles of export. Bremen is one of the greatest commercial towns in Germany.\n\nThe elector of Hanover is descended from the ancient family of the Guelphs, dukes and electors of Bavaria; one of whom, Henry the Lion, in 1142, married Maude, eldest daughter of King Henry (Plantagenet) II. of England. Their son William succeeded to Brunswick-Lüneburg, and his son Otho was created duke thereof. The dominions descended in a direct line to Ernest who divided them upon his death in 1546 into two branches, that of Brunswick-Lüneburg Wolfenbüttel, and Brunswick-Lüneburg Zell. The possessor of the latter, Ernest Augustus, was in 1692 raised to the dignity of an elector; before which he was head of the college of German princes. Ernest married Sophia, daughter of Frederic elector Palatine and king of Bohemia, by Elizabeth, daughter of James I. king of England. Sophia being the next Protestant heir to the house of Stuart, the parliament fixed the crown of Great Britain upon her on Queen Anne's demise; and George Louis her elder son became king of Great Britain in consequence thereof; since which the electors of Hanover have filled the British throne.\n\nHanover is also the name of the capital of the above electorate; and is agreeably situated in a sandy plain on the river Leyne, in E. Long. 10° 5'. N. Lat. 52° 5'. It is a large well-built town, and pretty well fortified. It has suffered greatly by the French, who got possession of it in 1757, but were soon after driven out. It is noted for a particular kind of beer, reckoned excellent in these parts. This city was the residence of the elector before he ascended the throne of Great Britain.\n\nIn 1803, when the war between Britain and France broke out, this capital, as well as the electorate, was seized by the French, and afterwards given up to Prussia, in whose possession it now (1806) remains.\n\nHanse, or Hans, an ancient name for a society or company of merchants; particularly that of certain cities in Germany, &c., hence called Hanse-towns. See Hanse-Towns.—The word hanse is obsolete High Dutch or Teutonic; and signifies \"alliance, confederacy, association,\" &c. Some derive it from the two German words, am see, that is, \"on the sea;\" by reason the first hanse-towns were all situated on the sea-coast; whence the society is said to have been first called am see flenen, that is, \"cities on the sea;\" and afterwards, by abbreviation, hansee, and hanse.\n\nHanse-Town. The hanseatic society was a league between several maritime cities of Germany, for the mutual protection of their commerce. Bremen and Amsterdam were the two first that formed it; whose trade received such advantage by their fitting out two men of war in each to convoy their ships, that more cities continually entered into the league: even kings and princes made treaties with them, and were often glad of their assistance and protection; by which means they grew so powerful both by sea and land, that they raised armies as well as navies, enjoyed countries in sovereignty, and made peace or war, though always in defence of their trade, as if they had been an united state or commonwealth.\n\nAt this time also abundance of cities, though they had no great interest in trade, or intercourse with the ocean, came into their alliance for the preservation of their liberties: so that in 1200 we find no less than 72 cities in the list of the towns of the Hanse; particularly Bremen, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Rotterdam, Dort, Bruges, Ostend, Dunkirk, Middleburgh, Calais, Rouen, Rochelle, Bordeaux, St Malo, Bayonne, Bilboa, Lisbon, Seville, Cadiz, Cartagena, Barcelona, Marseille, Leghorn, Naples, Messina, London, Lubec, Rofock, Stralsund, Stein, Wismar, Konigsberg, Dantzig, Elbing, Marienburg.\n\nThe alliance was now so powerful, that their ships of war were often hired by other princes to assist them against their enemies. They not only awed, but often defeated, all that opposed their commerce; and particularly in 1358, they took such revenge of the Danish fleet in the Sound, for having interrupted their commerce, that Waldemar III. then king of Denmark, for the sake of peace, gave them up all Schonen for 16 years; by which they commanded the passage of the Sound in their own right.—In 1428 they made war on Erick king of Denmark with 250 sail, carrying on board 12,000 men. These so ravaged the coast of Jutland, that the king was glad to make peace with them.\n\nMany privileges were bestowed upon the hanse towns by Louis XI., Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I., kings of France; as well as by the emperor Charles V., who had divers loans of money from them; and by King Henry III., who also incorporated them into a trading body, in acknowledgment for money which they advanced to him, as well as for the good services they did him by their naval forces in 1506.\n\nThese towns exercised a jurisdiction among themselves; for which purpose they were divided into four colleges or provinces, distinguished by the names of their four principal cities, viz. Lubec, Cologne, Brunswick, and Dantzig, wherein were held their courts of judicature. They had a common stock or treasury at Lubec, and power to call an assembly as often as necessary.—They kept magazines or warehouses for the sale of their merchandises in London, Bruges, Antwerp, Berg in Norway, Revel in Livonia, Novogorod in Muscovy, which were exported to most parts of Europe, in English, Dutch, and Flemish bottoms. One of their principal magazines was at London, where a society of German merchants was formed, called the fleetyard company. To this company great privileges were granted by Edward I., but revoked by act of parliament in 1552 in the reign of Edward VI., on a complaint of the English merchants that this company had so engrossed the cloth-trade, that in the preceding year they had exported 50,000 pieces, while all the English together had shipped off but 1100. Queen Mary, who ascended the throne the year following, having resolved to marry Philip the emperor's son,\nsuspended the execution of the act for three years; but after that term, whether by reason of some new statute, or in pursuance of that of King Edward, the privileges of that company were no longer regarded, and all efforts of the hanse-towns to recover this loss were in vain.\n\nAnother accident that happened to their modification was while Queen Elizabeth was at war with the Spaniards. Sir Francis Drake happening to meet 60 ships in the Tagus, loaded with corn belonging to the hanse-towns, took out all the corn as contraband goods, which they were forbidden to carry by their original patent. The hanse-towns having complained of this to the diet of the empire, the queen sent an ambassador thither to declare her reasons. The king of Poland likewise interested himself in the affair, because the city of Danzig was under his protection. At last, though the queen strove hard to preserve the commerce of the English in Germany, the emperor excluded the English company of merchant-adventurers, who had considerable factories at Stade, Emden, Bremen, Hamburg, and Elbing, from all trade in the empire. In short, the hanse-towns, in Germany in particular, were not only in so flourishing, but in so formidable a state, from the 14th to the 16th century, that they gave umbrage to all the neighbouring princes, who threatened a strong confederacy against them; and, as the first step towards it, commanded all the cities within their dominion or jurisdiction to withdraw from the union or hanse, and be no farther concerned therein. This immediately separated all the cities of England, France, and Italy, from them. The hanse, on the other hand, prudently put themselves under the protection of the empire; and as the cities just now mentioned had withdrawn from them; so they withdrew from several more, and made a decree among themselves, that none should be admitted into their society but such as stood within the limits of the German empire, or were dependent thereon; except Danzig, which continued a member, though in nowise dependent on the empire, only it had been summoned formerly to the imperial diet. By this means they maintained their confederacy for the protection of their trade, as it was begun, without being any more envied by their neighbours. Hereby likewise they were reduced to Lubeck, Bremen, Hamburg, and Danzig; in the first of which they kept their register, and held assemblies once in three years at least. But this hanse or union has for some time been dissolved; and now every one of the cities carries on a trade separately for itself, according to the stipulation in such treaties of peace, &c., as are made for the empire between the emperor and other potentates.\n\nHANWAY, Jonas, eminent for his benevolent designs and useful writings, was born at Portsmouth in Hampshire on the 25th of August 1712. His father, Mr Thomas Hanway, was an officer in the naval service, and for some years store-keeper to the dockyard at that place. He was deprived of his life by an accident; and left his widow with four children, Jonas, William, Thomas, and Elizabeth, all of a very tender age. Mrs Hanway coming to London after the death of her husband, put Jonas to school, where he learned writing and accounts, and made some proficiency in Latin. At the age of 17 he was sent to Lisbon, where he arrived in June 1729, and was bound apprentice to a merchant in that city. His early life, we are informed, was marked with that discreet attention to business, and love of neatness and regularity, which afterwards distinguished his character. At Lisbon his affections were captivated by a lady, then celebrated for her beauty and mental accomplishments; but she, preferring another for her husband, returned to England, and spent the latter part of her life in London with her family, on terms of friendship with Mr Hanway.—On the expiration of Mr Hanway's apprenticeship, he entered into business at Lisbon as a merchant or factor; but did not remain there long before he returned to London.\n\nHe soon after connected himself as a partner in Mr Dingley's house in St Peterburgh; where he arrived on the 10th of June 1743. The trade of the English nation over the Caspian sea into Persia at this period had been entrusted to the care of Mr Elton, who, not content with the pursuit of commercial affairs, had judiciously engaged in the service of Nadir Shah to build ships on the Caspian after the European manner. This had alarmed the merchants in the Russian trade, and a resolution was formed that one of their body should make a journey into Persia. On this occasion Mr Hanway offered his service, and was accepted. He set out on the 10th of September; and after experiencing a variety of hazards in that kingdom during a course of 12 months, returned to St Peterburgh January 1, 1745, without being able to establish the intended trade by the Caspian, partly through the jealousy of the Russian court on account of Elton's connections with the Persians, and partly by the troubles and revolutions of the latter kingdom.\n\nThough Mr Hanway's conduct during this expedition seems to have been directed by the strictest rules of integrity, yet some difficulties arose in settling his demands on his employers. These, however, in the end were referred to the determination of impartial arbitrators, who at length decided in his favour. \"I obtained (he says) my own; and as to any other personal advantage, it consisted in exercising my mind in patience under trials, and increasing my knowledge of the world.\" He now settled at St Peterburgh; where he remained five years, with no other variations in his life than such as may be supposed to occur in the dull round of a mercantile employment. During this time he interested himself greatly in the concerns of the merchants who had engaged in the Caspian trade; but the independence he had acquired having excited a desire to see his native country, he, after several disappointments which prevented him from accomplishing his wish, left St Peterburgh on the 9th of July 1750. On his arrival in his native country, he did not immediately relinquish his mercantile connections, though he seems to have left Russia with that view. He employed himself some time as a merchant; but afterwards, more beneficially to the world, as a private gentleman. In 1753 he published \"An Historical Account of the British trade over the Caspian sea; with a Journal of Travels from London through Russia into Persia; and back again through Russia, Germany, and Holland. To which are added, the Revolutions of Persia during the present century, with the particular History of the great Ufuper Nadir Kouli,\" 4 vols 4to; a work which was received\nreceived, as it deserved to be, with great attention from the public. In 1754, we find Mr Hanway commending a plan offered for the advantage of Westminster, and suggesting hints for the further improvement of it, in \"A Letter to Mr John Spranger, on his excellent Proposal for Paving, Cleaning, and Lighting the Streets of Westminster, &c.\" etc. A few years afterwards, when a scheme of the like kind was carried into effect, many of Mr Hanway's ideas, thrown out in this pamphlet, were adopted. In 1756, he printed \"A Journal of Eight Days Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston upon Thames, with an Essay upon Tea;\" which was afterwards reprinted in two volumes 8vo, 1757.\n\nAt this juncture, Great Britain being on the eve of a war with France, the event of which was very important to the nation at large, and required every effort of patriotism and prudence to ward off the impending danger, Mr Hanway published \"Thoughts on the Duty of a good Citizen with regard to War and Invasion, in a Letter from a Citizen to his Friend,\" 8vo. About the same time, several gentlemen formed a plan, which was matured and made perfect by the affluence of Mr Hanway, for providing the navy with sailors, by furnishing poor children with necessaries to equip them for the service of their country. The success and propriety of this scheme soon became apparent. Mr Hanway wrote and published three pamphlets on this occasion; and the treasurer of the Society, accompanied by Mr Hanway, having waited on the king, the Society received 100l. from his majesty, 400l. from the prince of Wales, and 200l. from the princess dowager. This excellent institution through life was the favourite object of Mr Hanway's care, and continued to flourish under his auspices greatly to the advantage of the community. In 1758 he became an advocate for another charitable institution, which derived considerable emolument from his patronage of it. This was the Magdalen Charity; and to assist it he published \"A Letter to Robert Dingley, Esq.; being a proposal for the Relief and Employment of friendless Girls and repenting Prostitutes,\" etc. He also printed other small performances on the same subject.\n\nIn 1739, Mr Hanway wrote \"Reasons for an Augmentation of at least Twelve Thousand Mariners, to be employed in the Merchants Service and Coasting Trade, in 33 Letters to Charles Gray, Esq.; of Colchester, 4to.\" The next year he published several performances, viz. 1. \"A candid historical Account of the Hospital for the reception of exposed and deserted young Children; representing the present Plan of it as productive of many Evils, and not adapted to the Genius and Happiness of this Nation,\" 8vo; which being answered by an anonymous Letter from Halifax in \"Candid Remarks, 8vo, 1760;\" Mr Hanway replied to it, and the Remarker rejoined. 2. \"An account of the Society for the Encouragement of the British Troops in Germany and North America, &c.\" 8vo. 3. \"Eight Letters to — Duke of ——, on the Custom of Vails giving in England,\" 8vo. This practice of giving vails had arrived at a very extravagant pitch, especially among the servants of the great. It was Mr Hanway who answered the kind reproach of a friend in a high station for not coming oftener to dine with him, by saying, \"Indeed I cannot afford it.\" The nobleman to whom the above letters were addressed was the duke of Newcastle. The letters are written in that humorous style which is most attractive of general notice, and was best adapted to the subject. It was Sir Timothy Waldo that first put Mr Hanway on this plan. Sir Timothy had dined with the duke of N——, and, on his leaving the house, was contributing to the support and influence of a train of servants who lined the hall; and at last put a crown into the hand of the cook, who returned it, saying, \"Sir, I do not take silver.\"—\"Don't you indeed?\" said the worthy baronet, putting it in his pocket: \"then I do not give gold.\" Among the ludicrous circumstances in Mr Hanway's letters is one which happened to himself. He was paying the servants of a respectable friend for a dinner which they had invited him to, one by one as they appeared; \"Sir, your great coat;\" a shilling—\"Your hat;\" a shilling—\"Stick;\" a shilling—\"Umbrella;\" a shilling—\"Sir, your gloves;\"—\"Why, friend, you may keep the gloves; they are not worth a shilling.\" In 1761, Mr Hanway produced \"Reflections, Essays, and Meditations on Life and Religion; with a collection of Proverbs, and 18 Letters written occasionally on several subjects,\" in 2 vols 8vo.\n\nThe many useful and public-spirited plans which Mr Hanway had promoted for the welfare of the community, had now rendered his character most respectfully popular, while his disinterestedness, and the sincerity of his intentions, were conspicuous to all. Five citizens of London, of whom Mr Hoare the banker was one, waited on Lord Bute, at that time the minister; and, in their own names, and the names of their fellow-citizens, requested that some notice might be taken of a man, who, at the expense of his own private fortune, and unremitting application, had rendered so many and such meritorious services to his country. In consequence of this request, he was in July 1762 appointed by a patent one of the commissioners for victualling the navy; a post which he held above 21 years. The next act of public beneficence in which we find him engaged is the collection of money for the sufferers by the fire which happened at Montreal, in the province of Quebec, in May 1765, when a fourth part of the city was consumed. On this occasion Mr Hanway, in conjunction with two other gentleman, collected £4,191.—The very next year a dreadful fire broke out in Bridge-Town in Barbadoes, which consumed buildings and property to the amount of near 100,000l. A subscription was opened, in which Mr Hanway was a principal actor, and 14,886l. were collected, and transmitted to a committee appointed at Barbadoes to distribute it to the unfortunate sufferers. At subsequent periods he continued to interest himself in various other plans for relieving the distresses, and promoting the good, of different classes of the community. His attention was particularly directed towards alleviating the miseries of young chimney-sweepers. Besides the distresses of these helpless beings, which are open to general observation, such as a contortion of the limbs, and the prevention of their growth, they are liable to a disease peculiar to their occupation, now known by the name of the chimney-sweepers cancer. Four children have been brought together into a workhouse, all afflicted with this dread-\nful and incurable disease. After much inquiry and consideration, he published, in 1773, \"The State of the Chimney-sweepers Young Apprentices; showing the wretched Condition of these distressed Boys; the ill Conduct of such matters as do not observe the Obligation of Indentures; the Necessity of a strict Inquiry in order to support the civil and religious Rights of these apprentices,\" 12mo. This small pamphlet has already been productive of some advantage to the objects intended to be benefited by it. The succeeding year, 1774, he enlarged a former publication, entitled \"Advice from a Farmer to his Daughter, &c.\" and republished it under the title of \"Virtue in humble Life: containing Reflections on the reciprocal Duties of the Wealthy and Indigent, the Master and the Servant,\" 2 vols 8vo; a work deserving the particular consideration of every magistrate. This edition in a few months being sold, he reprinted it in two quarto volumes, with a dedication to Mrs Montagu.\n\nIn 1783, finding his health decline, he determined to resign his office at the victualling board, which he did on the 2d of October that year; and immediately received a grant of his whole salary by way of a pension, to continue for life. This favour he owed to the esteem which his majesty, to whom he was personally known, entertained for him; excited by his various exertions in behalf of his country and mankind.—He was now released from his most material business, but did not think it would conduce to his happiness to lead an idle life. He engaged again in behalf of the chimney-sweepers boys; and promoted, by every means in his power, the establishment of Sunday-schools, which are now in a fair way to be adopted in every county in England. He likewise promoted a subscription for the relief of the many black poor people who wandered about the metropolis in extreme distress; and the lords of the treasury seconded the design, by directing money, as far as £4.1. a-head, to be issued to the committee, to enable them to send the blacks to such places abroad as might be fixed on. After encountering many obstacles, about 300 negroes were sent, properly accommodated with provisions and necessaries, to Africa, under the conduct of a person approved for that station. The object of this plan, besides relieving the misery of these poor people, was to prevent in time the unnatural connections between black persons and white; the disagreeable consequences of which make their appearance too frequently in our streets.\n\nIn the summer of 1786 Mr Hanway's health declined so visibly that he thought it necessary to attend only to that. He had long felt the approach of a disorder in the bladder, which, increasing by degrees, caused a strangury; and at length, on the 5th of September 1786, put a period to a life spent almost entirely in the service of his fellow-creatures. On the 13th he was interred in the family-vault at Hanwell, being attended to the grave by a numerous retinue of friends; and after his death the public regard to his virtues was displayed by a subscription of several hundred pounds towards erecting a monument to perpetuate his memory.\n\nMr Hanway in his person was of the middle size, of a thin spare habit, but well shaped; his limbs were fashioned with the nicest symmetry. In the latter years of his life he stooped very much; and when he walked, found it conducive to ease to let his head incline towards one side; but when he went first to Russia at the age of 30, his face was full and comely, and his person altogether such as obtained for him the appellation of the Handsome Englishman. In his dress, as far as was consistent with his health and ease, he accommodated himself to the prevailing fashion. As it was frequently necessary for him to appear in polite circles on unexpected occasions, he usually wore dress clothes, with a large French bag. His hat, ornamented with a gold button, was of a size and fashion to be worn as well under the arm as on the head. When it rained, a small parasol defended his face and wig. Thus he was always prepared to enter into any company without impropriety or the appearance of negligence. His dress for set public occasions was a suit of rich dark brown; the coat and waistcoat lined throughout with ermine, which just appeared at the edges; and a small gold-hilted sword. As he was extremely susceptible of cold, he wore flannel under the linings of all his clothes, and usually three pairs of stockings. He was the first man who ventured to walk the streets of London with an umbrella over his head. After carrying one near 30 years, he saw them come into general use. The precarious state of his health when he arrived in England from Russia, made it necessary for him to use the utmost caution; and his perseverance in following the advice of the medical practitioners was remarkable. After Dr Lieberkyn physician to the king of Prussia had recommended milk as a proper diet to restore his strength, he made it the chief part of his food for 30 years; and though it at first disagreed with him, he persisted in trying it under every preparation that it was capable of till it agreed with his stomach. By this rigid attention and care, his health was established; his lungs acquired strength and elasticity; and it is probable he would have lived several years longer, if the disorder which was the immediate cause of his death had left him to the gradual decay of nature. His mind was the most active that it is possible to conceive; always on the wing, and never appearing to be weary. He rose in the summer at four or five, and in the winter at seven. Having always business before him, he was every day employed till the time of retiring to rest; and, when in health, was commonly asleep within two minutes after his lying down in bed.\n\nWriting was his favourite employment, or rather amusement; and when the number of his literary works is considered, and that they were the produce only of those hours which he was able to snatch from public business, an idea may be formed of his application. But by leaving his work to transact his ordinary business, and afterwards recurring to it with new ideas, all his literary labours are defective in the arrangement of the matter, and appear to have too much of the miscellaneous in their composition. The original idea is sometimes left for the pursuit of one newly started, and either taken up again when the mind of the reader has almost lost it, or it is totally deserted. Yet those who are judges of literary composition say, that his language is well calculated to have the effect he desired on the reader, and impress him with the idea that the author was a man of inflexible integrity, and wrote from the pure dictates of the heart. It is plain\nand unornamented, without the appearance of art or the affectation of singularity. Its greatest defect (say they) is a want of conscience; its greatest beauty, an unaffected and genuine simplicity. He spoke French and Portuguese, and understood the Rufs and modern Peric imperfetly. Latin he had been taught at school, but had not much occasion to cultivate it after he entered into life.\n\nMr Hanway, although never married himself, was yet an advocate for marriage, and recommended it to all young people. He thought it the most effectual restraint on licentiousness, and that an increase of unhappiness was by no means the natural consequence of an increase of domestic cares. A \"local habitation,\" with the society of a sensible woman, the choice of unbiased affection, he esteemed as the most engaging persuasive to the love of order and economy; without which he thought life, in whatever station, must be disjointed, perturbed, and unhappy. The lady who engaged his first affection was uncommonly handsome; and it is probable he was prevented from marrying only by his failing to obtain her, and the unsettled manner in which the first years of his life were spent; for he loved the society of women; and in the parties which frequently breakfasted at his house, the ladies usually made the greater portion of the company.\n\nIn his transactions with the world, he was always open, candid, and sincere. Whatever he said might be depended on with implicit confidence. He adhered to the strict truth, even in the manner of his relations; and no brilliancy of thought could induce him to vary from the fact; but although so frank in his own proceedings, he had seen too much of life to be easily deceived by others; and he did not often place a confidence that was betrayed. He did not however, think the world so degenerate as is commonly imagined: \"And if I did (he used to say), I would not let it appear; for nothing can tend so effectually to make a man wicked, or to keep him so, as a marked suspicion. Confidence is the reward of truth and fidelity, and these should never be exerted in vain.\" In his department of commissioner for victualling the navy he was uncommonly affluence and attentive; and kept the contractors and persons who had dealings with the office at a great distance. He would not even accept a hare or pheasant, or the smallest present, from any of them; and when any were sent him, he always returned them, not in a morose manner, as if he affected the excess of disinterestedness, but with some mild answer; such as, \"Mr Hanway returns many thanks to Mr ——— for the present he intended him; but he has made it a rule not to accept anything from any person engaged with the office: A rule which, whilst he acknowledges Mr ———'s good intentions, he hopes he will not expect him to break through.\" With all this goodness, Mr Hanway had a certain singularity of thought and manners, which was perhaps the consequence of his living the greater part of his life in foreign countries, and never having been married. He was not by any means an inattentive observer of the little forms of politeness: but as he had studied them in various realms, selecting those which he approved, his politeness differed from that of other people; and his conversation had an air of originality in it that was very pleasing.\n\nBesides the works already mentioned in the course of this article, Mr Hanway was the author of a great number of others; his different publications amounting all together to between sixty and seventy. A complete list of them is given by his biographer Mr Pugh, from whose grateful and well-written performance this article has been chiefly extracted.\n\nHAP, or HARP, in Law, signifies to catch or snatch a thing. Thus we meet with, to hap the possession of a deed-poll. Littleton, fol. 8. also, to hap the rent. If partition be made between two parcers, and more land be allowed the one than the other, she that hath most of the land charges it to the other, and hatheth the rent whereon alike is brought.\n\nHAPPINESS, or FELICITY, absolutely taken, denotes the durable possession of perfect good without any mixture of evil; or the enjoyment of pure pleasure unalloyed with pain; or a state in which all the wishes are satisfied: In which senses, Happiness is known only by name upon the earth. The word happy, when applied to any state or condition of human life, will admit of no positive definition, but is merely a relative term: that is, when we call a man happy, we mean that he is happier than some others with whom we compare him; than the generality of others; or than he himself was in some other situation.\n\nThis interesting subject has been treated by many eminent writers, and in a great variety of ways; but by none does it appear to have been set in a clearer and more definite point of view than by Archdeacon Paley in the fifth chapter of his Principles of Philosophy. \"In strictness (says that elegant writer), any condition may be denominated happy in which the amount or aggregate of pleasure exceeds that of pain; and the degree of happiness depends upon the quantity of this excess. And the greatest quantity of it, ordinarily attainable in human life, is what we mean by happiness, when we inquire or pronounce what human happiness consists in.\n\nIf any positive signification, distinct from what we mean by pleasure, can be affixed to the term happiness, it may be taken to denote a certain state of the nervous system in that part of the human frame in which we feel joy and grief, passions and affections. Whether this part be the heart, which the turn of most languages would lead us to believe; or the diaphragm, as Buffon, or the upper orifice of the stomach, as Van Helmont thought; or rather be a kind of fine network, lining the whole region of the praecordia, as others have imagined; it is possible not only that every painful sensation may violently shake and disturb the fibres at the time, but that a series of such may at length destroy the very texture of the system, as to produce a perpetual irritation, which will show itself by fretfulness, restlessness, and impatience. It is possible also, on the other hand, that a succession of pleasurable sensations may have such an effect upon this subtle organization, as to cause the fibres to relax, and return into their place and order; and thereby to recover, or if not lost to preserve, that harmonious conformation which gives to the mind its sense of complacency and satisfaction. This state may be denominated happiness: And is so far distinguishable from pleasure, that it does not refer to any particular object of enjoyment, or consist like pleasure in the gratification of one or more of the senses; but is rather the secondary\nHappiness, secondary effect which such objects and gratifications produce upon the nervous system, or the state in which they leave it. The comparative sense, however, in which we have explained the term happiness, is more popular; and in prosecuting the subject, we may consider, 1. What human happiness does not consist in; and, 2. What it does consist in.\n\n1. First, then, happiness does not consist in the pleasures of sense, in whatever profusion or variety they be enjoyed. By the pleasures of sense are meant, as well the animal gratifications of eating, drinking, and that by which the species is continued, as the more refined pleasures of music, painting, architecture, gardening, splendid shows, theatrical exhibitions, and the pleasures, lastly, of active sports, as of hunting, shooting, fishing, &c. For, 1. These pleasures continue but for a little while at a time. This is true of them all, especially of the grolier sort. Laying aside the preparation and the expectation, and computing strictly the actual sensation, we shall be surprized to find how inconsiderable a portion of our time they occupy, how few hours in the four and twenty they are able to fill up.\n\n2. By repetition, they lose their relish. It is a property of the machine, for which we know no remedy, that the organs by which we perceive pleasure are blunted and benumbed, by being frequently exercised in the same way. There is hardly any one who has not found the difference between a gratification when new and when familiar, and any gratification which does not become indifferent as it grows habitual.\n\n3. The eagerness for high and intense delights takes away the relish from all others; and as such delights fall rarely in our way, the greater part of our time becomes from this cause empty and uneasy. There is hardly any delusion by which men are greater sufferers in their happiness than by their expecting too much from what is called pleasure; that is, from those intense delights which vulgarly engross the name of pleasure. The very expectation spoils them. When they do come, we are often engaged in taking pains to persuade ourselves how much we are pleased, rather than enjoying any pleasure which springs naturally out of the object. And whenever we depend upon being vastly delighted, we always go home secretly grieved at missing our aim. Likewise, as hath been observed just now, when this humour of being prodigiously delighted has once taken hold of the imagination, it hinders us from providing for acquiescing in those gently soothing engagements, the due variety and succession of which are the only things that supply a continued stream of happiness.\n\nThe truth seems to be, that there is a limit at which these pleasures soon arrive, and from which they ever afterwards decline. They are by necessity of short duration, as the organs cannot hold on their emotions beyond a certain length of time; and if you endeavour to compensate for this imperfection in their nature by the frequency with which you repeat them, you lose more than you gain by the fatigue of the faculties and the diminution of sensibility. We have in this account said nothing of the loss of opportunities or the decay of faculties, which whenever they happen leave the voluntary delirium and desperate; teased by desires that can never be gratified, and the memory of pleasures which must return no more. It will also be allowed by those who have experienced it, and perhaps by those alone, that pleasure which is purchased by the encumbrance of our fortune is purchased too dear; the pleasure never compensating for the perpetual irritation of embarrasled circumstances.\n\nThese pleasures, after all, have their value: and as the young are always too eager in their pursuit of them, the old are sometimes too remiss; that is, too studious of their ease to be at the pains for them which they really deserve.\n\nSecondly, Neither does happiness consist in an exemption from pain, labour, care, business, suspense, molestation, and those evils which are without; such a state being usually attended not with ease, but with depression of spirits, a tauntingness in all our ideas, imaginary anxieties, and the whole train of hypochondriacal affections. For which reason it seldom answers the expectations of those who retire from their shops and counting-houses to enjoy the remainder of their days in leisure and tranquillity; much less of such as in a fit of chagrin shut themselves up in cloisters and hermitages, or quit the world and their stations in it, for solitude and repose.\n\nWhere there exists a known external cause of uneasiness, the cause may be removed, and the uneasiness will cease. But those imaginary difficulties which men feel for want of real ones (and which are equally tormenting, and so far equally real), as they depend upon no single or assignable subject of uneasiness, so they admit off-times of no application or relief. Hence a moderate pain, upon which the attention may fall, and spend itself, is to many a refreshment; as a fit of the gout will sometimes cure the spleen. And the same of any moderate agitation of the mind, as a literary controversy, a law-suit, a contested election, and above all gaming; the passion for which, in men of fortune and liberal minds, is only to be accounted for on this principle.\n\nThirdly, Neither does happiness consist in greatness, rank, nor elevated station.\n\nWere it true that all superiority afforded pleasure, it would follow, that by how much we were the greater, that is, the more persons we were superior to, in the same proportion, so far as depended upon this cause, we should be the happier; but for it is, that no superiority yields any satisfaction, save that which we possess or obtain over those with whom we immediately compare ourselves. The shepherd perceives no pleasure in his superiority over his dog; the farmer in his superiority over the shepherd; the lord in his superiority over the farmer; nor the king, lastly, in his superiority over the lord. Superiority, where there is no competition, is seldom contemplated; what most men indeed are quite unconscious of. But if the same shepherd can run, fight, or wrestle, better than the peasants of his village; if the farmer can show better cattle, if he keeps a better horse, or be supposed to have a longer purse than any farmer in the hundred; if the lord have more interest in an election, greater favour at court, a better house, or larger estate, than any nobleman in the county; if the king possesses a more extensive territory, a more powerful fleet or army, a more splendid establishment, more loyal subjects, or more weight and authority in adjusting the affairs of nations, than any prince in Europe; in all these cases,\nHappiness, cases, the parties feel an actual satisfaction in their superiority. No superiority appears to be of any account but a superiority over a rival. This, it is manifest, may exist wherever rivalships do; and rivalships fall out amongst men of all ranks and degrees. The object of emulation, the dignity or magnitude of this object, makes no difference; as it is not what either policies that constitutes the pleasure, but what one policies more than the other. Philosophy smiles at the contempt with which the rich and great speak of the petty strifes and competitions of the poor; not reflecting that these strifes and competitions are just as reasonable as their own, and the pleasure which succeeds affords the same.\n\nIt appears evident then, that happiness does not consist in greatness; since what are supposed to be the peculiar advantages of greatness, the pleasures of ambition and superiority, are in reality common to all conditions. But whether the pursuits of ambition be ever wise, whether they contribute more to the happiness or misery of the pursuers, is a different question; and a question concerning which we may be allowed to entertain great doubt. The pleasure of success is exquisite; so also is the anxiety of the pursuit, and the pain of disappointment; and what is the worst part of the account, the pleasure is short-lived. We soon cease to look back upon those whom we have left behind; new contests are engaged in, new prospects unfold themselves; a succession of struggles is kept up, whilst there is a rival left within the compass of our views and profession; and when there is none, the pleasure with the pursuit is at an end.\n\nII. We have seen what happiness does not consist in. We are next to consider in what it does consist. In the conduct of life, the great matter is, to know beforehand what will please us, and what pleasures will hold out. So far as we know this, our choice will be justified by the event. And this knowledge is more rare and difficult than at first sight it may seem to be: For sometimes pleasures, which are wonderfully alluring and flattering in the prospect, turn out in the possession extremely insipid; or do not hold out as we expected; at other times pleasures start up, which never entered into our calculation, and which we might have missed of by not foreseeing; from whence we have reason to believe, that we actually do miss of many pleasures from the same cause.\n\nBy reason of the original diversity of taste, capacity and constitution, observable in the human species, and the still greater variety which habit and fashion have introduced in these particulars; it is impossible to propose any plan of happiness which will succeed to all, or any method of life which is universally eligible or practicable. All that can be said is, that there remains a presumption in favour of those conditions of life in which men generally appear most cheerful and contented. For though the apparent happiness of mankind be not always a true measure of their real happiness, it is the best measure we have.\n\nUpon this principle, then, happiness appears to consist,\n\n1. In the exercise of the social affections.—Those persons commonly possess good spirits who have about them many objects of affection and endearment; as wife, children, kindred, friends; and to the want of these may be imputed the peevishness of monks and such as lead a monastic life. Of the same nature with the indulgence of our domestic affections, and equally refreshing to the spirits, is the pleasure which results from acts of bounty and benevolence, exercised either in giving money, or in imparting to those who want it the affluence of our skill and profession.\n\n2. Another main article of human happiness is, the exercise of our faculties, either of body or mind, in the pursuit of some engaging end.\n\nIt seems to be true, that no plenitude of present gratifications can make the possessor happy for a continuance, unless he have something in reserve, something to hope for and look forward to. This may be inferred from comparing the alacrity and spirits of men who are engaged in any pursuit which interests them, with the dejection and ennui of almost all who are either born to so much that they want nothing more, or who have used up their satisfactions too soon and drained the sources of them. It is this intolerable vacancy of mind which carries the rich and great to the horse-course and the gaming table; and often engages them in contests and pursuits, of which the success bears no proportion to the solicitude and expense with which it is fought.\n\nThe question now occurs, How are we to provide ourselves with a succession of pleasurable engagements? This requires two things: Judgment in the choice of ends adapted to our opportunities; and a command of imagination, so as to be able, when the judgment has made choice of an end, to transfer a pleasure to the means; after which the end may be forgotten as soon as we will. Hence those pleasures are most valuable, not which are most exquisite in the fruition, but most productive of engagement and activity in the pursuit.\n\nA man who is in earnest in his endeavours after the happiness of a future state, has in this respect an advantage over all the world. For he has constantly before his eyes an object of supreme importance, productive of perpetual engagement and activity, and of which the pursuit (which can be said of no pursuit besides) lasts him to his life's end. Yet even he must have many ends beside the far end; but then they will conduct to that, be subordinate, and in some way or other capable of being referred to that, and derive their satisfaction, or an addition of satisfaction, from that.\n\nEngagement is every thing. The more significant, however, our engagements are, the better; such as the planning of laws, institutions, manufactures, charities, improvements, public works, and the endeavouring by our interest, address, solicitations, and activity, to carry them into effect: Or upon a smaller scale, the procuring of a maintenance and fortune for our families, by a course of industry and application to our callings, which forms and gives motion to the common occupations of life; training up a child; prosecuting a scheme for his future establishment; making ourselves masters of a language or a science; improving or managing an estate; labouring after a piece of preferment: And, lastly, any engagement which is innocent is better than none; as the writing of a book, the building of a house, the laying out of a garden, the digging of a fish-pond; even the raising of a cucumber or a tulip. Whilst the mind is taken up with the objects or business before it, we are commonly happy, whatever\nHappiness whatever the object or business be: when the mind is abled, and the thoughts are wandering to something else than what is passing in the place in which we are, we are often miserable.\n\n3. The art in which the secret of human happiness in a great measure consists, is to set the habits in such a manner, that every change may be a change for the better. The habits themselves are much the same; for whatever is made habitual becomes smooth, and easy, and indifferent. The return to an old habit is likewise easy, whatever the habit be. Therefore the advantage is with those habits which allow of indulgence in the deviation from them. The luxurious receive no greater pleasure from their dainties than the peasant does from his bread and cheese; but the peasant whenever he goes abroad finds a feast, whereas the epicure must be well entertained to escape disgust. Those who spend every day at cards, and those who go every day to plough, pass their time much alike; intent upon what they are about, wanting nothing, regretting nothing, they are both in a state of ease. But then, whatever fulfils the occupation of the card-player distresses him; whereas to the labourer every interruption is a refreshment: and this appears in the different effect that the Sabbath produces upon the two, which proves a day of recreation to the one, but a lamentable burden to the other. The man who has learned to live alone, feels his spirits enlivened whenever he enters into company, and takes his leave without regret: another, who has long been accustomed to a crowd or continual succession of company, experiences in company no elevation of spirits, nor any greater satisfaction than what the man of a retired life finds in his chimney-corner. So far their conditions are equal: but let a change of place, fortune, or situation, separate the companion from his circle, his visitors, his club, common-room, or coffee-house, and the difference of advantage in the choice and constitution of the two habits will show itself. Solitude comes to the one clothed with melancholy: to the other it brings liberty and quiet. You will see the one fretful and restless, at a loss how to dispose of his time, till the hour comes round that he can forget himself in bed: the other easy and satisfied, taking up his book or his pipe as soon as he finds himself alone; ready to admit any little amusement that casts up, or to turn his hands and attention to the first business that presents itself; or content without either to sit still, and let his trains of thought glide indolently through his brain, without much use perhaps or pleasure, but without hankering after anything better, and without irritation. A reader who has imured himself to books of science and argumentation, if a novel, a well-written pamphlet, an article of news, a narrative of a curious voyage, or the journal of a traveller, fall in his way, sits down to the repast with relish, enjoys his entertainment while it lasts, and can return when it is over to his graver reading without dilatace. Another, with whom nothing will go down but works of humour and pleasantry, or whole curiosity must be interested by perpetual novelty, will consume a bookeller's window in half a forenoon; during which time he is rather in search of diversion than diverted: and as books to his taste are few and short, and rapidly read over, the stock is soon exhausted, when he is left without resource from this principal supply of innocent amusement.\n\nSo far as circumstances of fortune conduce to happiness, it is not the income which any man possesses, but the increase of income that affords the pleasure. Two persons, of whom one begins with 100l. and advances his income to 1000l. a-year; and the other sets off with 1000l. and dwindles down to 100l. may, in the course of their time, have the receipt and spending of the same sum of money: yet their satisfaction, so far as fortune is concerned in it, will be very different: the series and sum total of their incomes being the same, it makes a wide difference which end they begin at.\n\n4. Happiness consists in health; understanding by health, not only freedom from bodily distempers, but also that tranquillity, firmness, and alacrity of mind, which we call good spirits. For the sake of health, according to this notion of it, no sacrifices can be too great. Whether it requires us to relinquish lucrative situations, to abstain from favourite indulgences, to control intemperate passions, or undergo tedious regimens; whatever difficulties it lays us under, a man, who pursues his happiness rationally and resolutely, will be content to submit to. When we are in perfect health and spirits, we feel in ourselves a happiness independent of any particular outward gratification whatever, and of which we can give no account. This is an enjoyment which the Deity has annexed to life; and probably constitutes, in a great measure, the happiness of infants and brutes, especially of the lower and feline orders of animals, as of oysters, periwinkles, and the like.\n\nThe above account of human happiness will justify these two conclusions, which, although found in most books of morality, have seldom been supported by any sufficient reasons: 1. That happiness is pretty equally distributed among the different orders of civil society; and, 2. That vice has no advantage over virtue, even with respect to this world's happiness.\"\n\nHAQUE, in our old writers, a little hand-gun, prohibited to be used for destruction of game, &c. by statute 33 Hen.

See SERAGLIO.\n\nHARAN, CHARRAN, or CHARRAE in Mesopotamia, a city celebrated for having been the place where Abraham first retreated after he left Ur (Gen. xi. 31, 32.); and where Terah, Abraham's father, died and was buried. Thither it was likewise that Jacob retired to Laban when he fled from the indignation of his brother Esau (id. xxvii. 45, xxviii. 10, &c.) Lastly, at Haran or Charrae in Mesopotamia, Craflus the Roman general was defeated and killed by the Parthians. Haran was situated between the Euphrates and the river Chebar, at a considerable distance from the place where these two rivers join.\n\nHARANGUE, a modern French name for a speech or oration made by an orator in public.—Menage derives the word from the Italian arenga, which signifies the same; formed, according to Ferrari, from arringo, \"a just, or place of justing.\" Others derive it from\nHarangues the Latin *ara*, \"altar;\" by reason the first harangues were made before altars; whence the verse of Juvenal,\n\n*Aut Lugdunensis rhetor disturus ad aram.*\n\nHarangues were usually made by the generals, previous to an engagement both amongst the Greeks and Romans. An harangue on such occasions was called *allocutio*. See *ALLOCUTIO*.\n\nThe word is also frequently used in an ill sense, viz. for a too pompous, prolix, or unseasonable speech or declamation.\n\n**HARBINGER**, an officer of the king's household, having four yeomen under him, who ride a day's journey before the court when it travels, to provide lodgings, &c.\n\n**HARBOURGH**, a town of Leicestershire, 84 miles from London. It is a great thoroughfare in the road to Derby, near the source of the river Welland; and was famous, in Camden's time, for its beef fair, where the best horses and colts are still sold. Its fairs are April 29 and Oct. 19. The market is on Tuesday, for the use of which the earl of Harborough built a neat market-house at his own expense. W. Long, o. 52. N. Lat. 52° 28'.\n\n**HARBOUR**, a general name given to any sea-port or haven; as also to any place convenient for mooring shipping, although at a great distance from the sea. The qualities requisite in a good harbour are, that the bottom be entirely free from rocks or shallows; that the opening be of sufficient extent to admit the entrance or departure of large ships without difficulty; that it should have good anchoring-ground, and be easy of access; that it should be well defended from the violence of the wind and sea; that it should have room and convenience to receive the shipping of different nations, and those which are laden with different merchandises; that it be furnished with a good light-house, and have variety of proper rings, posts, moorings, &c., in order to remove or secure the vessels contained therein; and, finally, that it have plenty of wood, and other materials for firing, besides hemp, iron, mariners, &c.\n\n**HARBURG**, a small town of Germany, in the circle of Lower Saxony, and duchy of Lunenburg, seated on the river Elbe opposite to Hamburg. It was surrounded with walls in 1355; and 30 years after, a strong castle, which still remains, was built by the bishop. E. Long, 9. 41. N.

See STEEL.\n\n*Cold Hardening.* See Cass-Hardening.\n\n**HARDERWICK**, a town of the United Provinces, in Dutch Guelderland. It is a well-built town, and Harderwijk, the chief of the sea-ports of this province. It has several good buildings, particularly the great church, which is much admired. In 1648 the public school here was turned into an university. The French did it a great deal of damage in 1672; since which time it has been on the decline. E. Long. 5. 40. N. Lat. 52° 23'.\n\n**HARDNESS**, in bodies, a property directly opposite to fluidity; by which they resist the impression of any other substance, sometimes in an extreme degree. As fluidity has been found to consist in the motion of the particles of a body upon one another in consequence of a certain action of the universal fluid or elementary fire among them; we must conclude that hardness consists in the absence of this action, or a deficiency of what is called latent heat. This is confirmed by observing, that there is an intermediate state between hardness and fluidity, in which bodies will yield to a certain force, though they still make a considerable resistance. This is principally observed in the metals, and is the foundation of their ductility. It appears indeed, that this last property, as well as fluidity, is entirely dependent on a certain quantity of latent heat absorbed, or otherwise acting within the substance itself; for all the metals are rendered hard by hammering, and soft by being put again into the fire and kept there for some time. The former operation renders them hot as well as hard; probably, as Dr Black observes, because the particles of metal are thus forced nearer one another, and those of fire squeezed out among them. By keeping them for some time in the fire, that element infuses itself again among the particles, and arranges them in the same manner as before, so that the ductility returns. By a second hammering this property is again destroyed, returning on a repetition of the heating or annealing as it is called; and so on, as often as we please.\n\nHardness appears to diminish the cohesion of bodies in some degree, though their fragility does not by any means keep pace with their hardness. Thus, glass is very hard and very brittle; but flint, though still harder than glass, is much less brittle. Among the metals, however, these two properties seem to be more connected, though even here the connexion is by no means complete. Steel, the hardest of all the metals, is indeed the most brittle; but lead, the softest, is not the most ductile. Neither is hardness connected with the specific gravity of bodies; for a diamond, the hardest substance in nature, is little more than half the weight of the lightest metal. As little is it connected with the coldness, electrical properties, or any other quality with which we are acquainted; so that though the principle above laid down may be accepted as a general foundation for our inquiries, a great number of particulars remain yet to be discovered before we can offer any satisfactory explanation.\n\nAll bodies become harder by cold; but this is not the only means of their doing so, for some become hard by heat as well as cold. Thus, water becomes hard by cold when it is frozen, but it becomes much harder when its steam is passed over red-hot iron, and it enters the substance of the metal, by an union with which it becomes almost as hard as glass.\n\nDr Quist and others have constructed tables of the hardness...\nHAR\n\nHardnesses of different substances. The method pursued in constructing these tables was by observing the order in which they were able to cut or make any impression upon one another. The following table, extracted from M. Magellan's edition of Cronstedt's Mineralogy, was taken from Dr Quitt, Bergman, and Mr Kirwan. The first column shows the hardnesses, and the second the specific gravity.\n\n| Diamond from Ormus | 20 | 3.7 |\n| Pink diamond       | 19 | 3.4 |\n| Bluish diamond     | 19 | 3.3 |\n| Yellowish diamond  | 19 | 3.3 |\n| Cubic diamond      | 18 | 3.2 |\n| Ruby               | 17 | 4.2 |\n| Pale ruby from Brazil | 16 | 3.5 |\n| Ruby spinell       | 13 | 3.4 |\n| Deep blue sapphire | 16 | 3.8 |\n| Ditto paler        | 17 | 3.8 |\n| Topaz              | 15 | 4.2 |\n| Whitish ditto      | 14 | 3.5 |\n| Bohemian ditto     | 11 | 2.8 |\n| Emerald            | 12 | 2.8 |\n| Garnet             | 12 | 4.4 |\n| Agate              | 12 | 2.6 |\n| Onyx               | 12 | 2.6 |\n| Sardonyx           | 12 | 2.6 |\n| Occid. amethyst    | 11 | 2.7 |\n| Crystal            | 11 | 2.6 |\n| Cornelian          | 11 | 2.7 |\n| Green jasper       | 11 | 2.7 |\n| Reddish yellow ditto | 9  | 2.6 |\n| Schoelr            | 10 | 3.6 |\n| Tourmaline         | 10 | 3.0 |\n| Quartz             | 10 | 2.7 |\n| Opal               | 10 | 2.6 |\n| Chrysolite         | 10 | 3.7 |\n| Zeolite            | 8  | 2.1 |\n| Flour              | 7  | 3.5 |\n| Calcareous spar    | 6  | 2.7 |\n| Gypsum             | 5  | 2.3 |\n| Chalk              | 3  | 2.7 |\n\nHARDOUIN, JOHN, a learned French Jesuit in the beginning of the 18th century, known by the remarkable paradoxes he advanced in his writings; this in particular, That all the works of the ancient profane writers, except Cicero's works, Virgil's Georgics, Horace's satires and epistles, and Pliny's natural history, are mere forgeries. He died at Paris in 1729, aged 83. His principal works are, 1. An edition of Pliny's natural history, with notes, which is much esteemed. 2. An edition of the councils, which made much noise. 3. Chronology restored by medals, 4to. 4. A commentary on the New Testament, folio; in which he pretends that our Saviour and his apostles preached in Latin, &c.\n\nHARDWICKE. See YORK.\n\nHARE. See LEPUS, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nThe hare is a beast of venery, or of the forest, but peculiarly so termed in the second year of her age. There are reckoned four sorts of them, from the place of their abode: some live in the mountains, some in the fields, some in marshes, and some wander about everywhere. The mountain-hares are the swiftest, the field-hares are not so nimble, and those of the marshes are the slowest; but the wandering hares are the most cunning in the paths and mazes of the fields, for, knowing the nearest ways, they run up the hills and rocks, to the confusion of the dogs. See HUNTING.\n\nHares and rabbits are very mischievous to new planted orchards, by peeling off the bark of the young trees for food. They do also the same sort of mischief to nurseries; for the prevention of which, some bind ropes about the trees up to a sufficient height; some daub them with tar; but though this keeps off the hares, it is itself mischievous to the trees; but this hurtful property of it is in some degree taken off by mixing any kind of fat or grease with it, and incorporating them well over the fire. This mixture is to be rubbed over the lower part of the trees in November, and will preserve them till that time the next year, without any danger from these animals. It is only in the hard weather in the winter season, when other food is scarce, that these creatures feed on the barks of trees.\n\nPeople who have the care of warrens, pretend to make hares fat by stopping up their ears with wax, and rendering them deaf. The hare is so timorous a creature, that she is continually listening after every noise, and will run a long way on the least suspicion of danger; so that she always eats in terror, and runs herself out of flesh continually. These are both prevented by her feeding without apprehension.\n\nJovia Hare. See Mus, MAMMALIA Index.\n\nHares Ear. See Bupleurum, BOTANY Index.\n\nHARE, Dr Francis, an English bishop, of whose birth we have no particulars, was bred at Eton school, and from that foundation became a member of King's college, Cambridge; where he had the tuition of the marquis of Blandford, only son of the illustrious duke of Marlborough, who appointed him chaplain-general to the army. He afterwards obtained the deanery of Worcester, and from thence was promoted to the bishopric of Chichester, which he held with the deanery, of St Paul's to his death, which happened in 1740. He was dismissed from being chaplain to George I. in 1718, by the strength of party prejudices, in company with Dr Moles and Dr Sherlock, persons of distingued rank for parts and learning. About the latter end of Queen Anne's reign he published a remarkable pamphlet, intitled, The difficulties and discouragements which attend the study of the Scriptures, in the way of private judgment: in order to show, that since such a study of the Scriptures is an indispensible duty, it concerns all Christian societies to remove, as much as possible, those discouragements. In this work, his manner appeared to be so ludicrous, that the convocation fell upon him, as if he were really against the study of the Holy Scriptures: and Whiston says, that finding this piece likely to hinder that preferment he was seeking for, he aimed to conceal his being the author. He published many pieces against Bishop Hoadley, in the Bangorian Controversy, as it is called; and also other learned works, which were collected after his death, and published in four vols 8vo. 2. An edition of Terence, with notes, in 4to. 3. The book of Psalms in the Hebrew, put into the original poetical metre, 4to. In this last work, he pretends to have discovered the Hebrew metre, which was supposed to be irretrievably lost.

He published his first considerable collection in August 1705, and in less than ten years he got together near 2500 rare and curious MSS. Soon after this, the celebrated Dr George Hicks, Mr Anstis garter king at arms, Bishop Nicolson, and many other eminent antiquaries, not only offered him their assistance in procuring MSS. but presented him with several that were very valuable. Being thus encouraged to perseverance by his success, he kept many persons employed in purchasing MSS. for him abroad, giving them written instructions for their conduct. By these means the MS. library was, in the year 1721, increased to near 6000 books, 14,000 original charters, and 500 rolls.\n\nOn the 21st of May 1724 Lord Oxford died; but his son Edward, who succeeded to his honours and estate, still farther enlarged the collection; so that when he died, June 16th 1741, it consisted of 8000 volumes, several of them containing distinct and independent treaties, besides many loose papers which have been since sorted and bound up in volumes; and above 40,000 original rolls, charters, letters patent, grants, and other deeds and instruments of great antiquity.\n\nThe principal design of making this collection was the establishment of a MS. English historical library, and the rescuing from destruction such national records as had eluded the diligence of preceding collectors; but Lord Oxford's plan was more extensive; for his collection abounds also with curious MSS. in every science. This collection is now in the British Museum; and an enumeration of its contents may be seen in the Annual Register, vi. 140, &c.\n\nHARLEM, a town of the United Provinces, in Holland, situated on the river Sparren, in E. Long. 4. 38. N. Lat. 52. 24. It is a large and populous city, and stands near a lake of the same name, with which it has a communication, as well as with Amsterdam and Leyden, by means of several canals. Schemes have been often formed for draining of this lake, but were never put into execution. To the south of the town lies a wood, cut into delightful walks and vistas. The town is famous for the siege which it held out against the Spaniards for ten months in 1573; the townsmen, before they capitulated, being reduced to eat the vilest animals, and even leather and grails. The inhabitants corresponded with the prince of Orange for a considerable time by means of carrier-pigeons. Harlem, as is well known, claims the invention of printing; and in fact, the first essays of the art are indubitably to be attributed to Laurentius, a magistrate of that city. [See Laurentius, and (History of) Printing.] Before the Reformation, Harlem was a bishop's see; and the Papists still greatly outnumber the Protestants. An academy of sciences was founded here in 1752. Vast quantities of linen and thread are bleached here; the waters of the lake having a peculiar quality, which renders them very fit for that purpose.—A sort of profanity with regard to flowers, particularly tulips, once prevailed here, in consequence of which the most beautiful sorts were bought and sold at an extravagant price.\n\nHARLEQUIN, in the Italian comedy, a buffoon, dressed in party-coloured clothes; answering much the same purpose as a merry-andrew or jack-pudding in our drolls, on mountebanks, stages, &c. We have also introduced the harlequin upon our theatres; and this is one of the standing characters in the modern grotesque or pantomime entertainments. The term took its rise from a famous Italian comedian who came to Paris under Henry III., and who frequenting the house of M. de Harlay, his companions used to call him Harlequin, q. d. little Harlay; a name which has descended to all those of the same rank and profession.\n\nHARLEY, ROBERT, earl of Oxford and Mortimer, was the eldest son of Sir Edward Harley, and born in 1661. At the Revolution, Sir Edward and his son raised a troop of horse at their own expense; and after the accession of King William and Queen Mary, he obtained a seat in parliament. His promotions were rapid. In 1702, he was chosen speaker of the house of commons; in 1704, he was sworn of Queen Anne's privy council, and the same year made secretary of state; in 1706, he acted as one of the commissioners for the treaty of union; and in 1710 was appointed a commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor and undertreasurer of the exchequer. A daring attempt was made on his life, March 8, 1711, by the marquis of Guiscard a French Papist; who, when under an examination before a committee of the privy council, stabbed him with a penknife. Of this wound, however, he soon recovered.\nHARLING, See HERLING.\n\nHARLINGEN, a sea-port town of the United Netherlands, in West Friesland. It stands on the coast of the Zuider Sea, at the mouth of a large canal, in E. Long. 5° 14'. N. Lat. 53° 9'. It was only a hamlet till about the year 1234, when it was destroyed by the sea; and being afterwards rebuilt, became a considerable town. In 1579, it was considerably enlarged by the care of William prince of Orange. It is now very well fortified, and is naturally strong, as the adjacent country can very easily be laid under water. The city is square; and the streets are handsome, straight, and clean, with canals in the middle of them. It has five gates; four towards the land, and one towards the sea; but though the harbour is good, yet vessels of great burden cannot get into it until they are lightened, for want of water. The admiralty college of Friesland has its seat here. The manufactures are felt, bricks, and tiles, a considerable trade is also carried on in all sorts of linen cloth, and the adjacent country yields abundance of corn and good pastures.\n\nHARLOCH, or HARLEIGH, a town of Merionethshire, in North Wales, 223 miles from London, on the sea coast, near the north-west point of the county. It is naturally strong, a garrison being kept here for the security of the coast. Its cattle lies now in ruins. The town, though a corporation and governed by a mayor, makes but a very mean appearance. It has a market on Saturdays, and four fairs in the year.\n\nHARLOT, a woman given to incontinency, or that makes a habit or a trade of prostituting her body. —The word is supposed to be used for the diminutive whorelet, a \"little whore.\"—Others derive it from Arletta, mistress to Robert duke of Normandy, and mother to William the Conqueror: Camden derives it from one Arlotha, concubine to William the Conqueror: Others from the Italian Arlotta, \"a proud whore.\"\n\nHarlots were tolerated amongst Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Fornication indeed was prohibited among the Jews, under severe penalties; but those they explained as extending only to women of their own nation. The public stews were therefore stocked with foreign prostitutes, who seem to have been taken under the protection of government. Hence appears the reason why the word strange woman is often found to signify a harlot. Prostitutes at first wore veils or masks; but by and by their modesty was entirely put to flight, and they went abroad bare-faced. At Athens the prostitutes were generally strangers; and such as debauched an Athenian female were liable to a penalty. To frequent the public flews was not held disgraceful! The wisest of the Heathen fates allowed it! Solon permitted common whores to go publicly to the young men who had engaged them, and encouraged the youth of Athens to gratify their lust with these, rather than seduce Harattan, and debauch the wives or daughters of citizens. Cato the censor was of the same sentiments; and Cicero challenges all persons to name a time when men were either reproved for this practice, or not countenanced in it. Amongst the Jews, the harlots used to ply in the highways and streets of cities; at Athens they frequented the ceramicus, sciro, and the old forum.—In some places they were distinguished by their dress from other women. Corinth was a remarkable nursery of harlots, and gave birth to the noted Laïs. Their accomplishments were oftentimes great, in all the polite and elegant parts of female education, viz. philosophy, dancing, singing, rhetoric, &c. Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles, was admired by Socrates for her learning. The more accomplished prostitutes frequently amassed large fortunes: a remarkable instance of which we have in Phryne, who offered to rebuild the walls of Thebes, when destroyed by Alexander, on condition that they would perpetuate her memory and profession by an inscription. Prostitutes at Rome were obliged to fix a bill over their doors, indicating their character and profession. It was also customary for them to change their names, after they had signified to the praetor their intention of leading such a dissolute life: this they did, because their trade was unbecoming their birth and condition; but they reassumed their family names when they quitted their infamous mode of living. Women whose grandfather, father, or husband, had been a Roman knight, were forbidden by the laws to make a public profession of lewdness.\n\nHARMATTAN, the name of a remarkable periodical wind which blows from the interior parts of Africa towards the Atlantic ocean. Of this wind we have the following account in the Phil. Trans. vol. lxxi., furnished by Mr Norris, a gentleman who had frequent opportunities of observing its singular properties and effects.\n\nOn that part of the coast of Africa which lies between Cape Verd and Cape Lopez, an easterly wind prevails during the months of December, January, and February, which by the Fantees, a nation on the Gold coast, is called the Harmattan. Cape Verd is in 15° N. Lat, and Cape Lopez in 1° S. Lat.; and the coast between these two capes runs, in an oblique direction, nearly from W. S. W. to E. S. E. forming a range of upwards of 2100 miles. At the iles de Los, which are a little to the northward of Sierra Leone, and to the southward of Cape Verd, it blows from the E. S. E. on the Gold coast from the N. E. and at Cape Lopez, and the river Gabon, from the N. N. E. This wind is by the French and Portuguese, who frequent the Gold coast, called simply the north-east wind, the quarter from which it blows. The English, who sometimes borrow words and phrases from the Fantee language, which is less guttural and more harmonious than that of their neighbours, adopt the Fantee word Harmattan.\n\nThe harmattan comes on indiscriminately at any hour of the day, at any time of the tide, or at any period of the moon, and continues sometimes only a day or two, sometimes five or six days, and it has been known to last fifteen or sixteen days. There are generally three or four returns of it every season. It blows with a moderate force, not quite so strong as the sea-breeze.\nHarmattan breeze (which every day sets in during the fair season from the W., W. S. W., and S. W.) but somewhat stronger than the land wind at night from the N. and N. N. W.\n\n1. A fog or haze is one of the peculiarities which always accompanies the harmattan. The gloom occasioned by this fog is so great, as sometimes to make even near objects obscure. The English fort at Whydah stands about the midway between the French and Portuguese forts, and not quite a quarter of a mile from either, yet very often from thence neither of the other forts can be discovered. The sun, concealed the greatest part of the day, appears only a few hours about noon, and then of a mild red, exciting no painful sensation on the eye.\n\n2. Extreme dryness makes another extraordinary property of this wind. No dew falls during the continuance of the harmattan; nor is there the least appearance of moisture in the atmosphere. Vegetables of every kind are very much injured; all tender plants, and most of the productions of the garden, are destroyed; the grass withers, and becomes dry like hay; the vigorous evergreens likewise feel its pernicious influence; the branches of the lemon, orange, and lime trees droop, the leaves become flaccid, wither, and if the harmattan continues to blow for 10 or 12 days, are so parched, as to be easily rubbed to dust between the fingers: the fruit of these trees, deprived of its nourishment, and stinted in its growth, only appears to ripen, for it becomes yellow and dry, without acquiring half the usual size. The natives take this opportunity of the extreme dryness of the grass and young trees to set fire to them, especially near their roads, not only to keep those roads open to travellers, but to destroy the shelter which long grass, and thickets of young trees, would afford to lurking parties of their enemies. A fire thus lighted flies with such rapidity, as to endanger those who travel: in that situation, a common method of escape is, on discovering a fire to windward, to set the grass on fire to leeward, and then follow your own fire. There are other extraordinary effects produced by the extreme dryness of the harmattan.\n\nThe parching effects of this wind are likewise evident on the external parts of the body. The eyes, nostrils, lips, and palate, are rendered dry and uneasy, and drink is often required, not so much to quench thirst, as to remove a painful aridity in the fauces. The lips and nose become sore, and even chapped; and though the air be cool, yet there is a troublesome sensation of prickling heat on the skin. If the harmattan continues four or five days, the scarf skin peels off, first from the hands and face, and afterwards from the other parts of the body if it continues a day or two longer. Mr Norris observed, that when sweat was excited by exercise on those parts which were covered by his clothes from the weather, it was peculiarly acrid, and tasted, on applying his tongue to his arm, something like spirits of hartshorn diluted with water.\n\n3. Salubrity forms a third peculiarity of the harmattan. Though this wind is so very prejudicial to vegetable life, and occasions such disagreeable parching effects on the human species, yet it is highly conducive to health. Those labouring under fluxes and intermittent fevers generally recover in an harmattan. Those harmattan weakened by fevers, and sinking under evacuations for the cure of them, particularly bleeding, which is often injudiciously repeated, have their lives saved, and vigour restored, in spite of the doctor. It stops the progress of epidemics; the smallpox, remittent fevers, &c., not only disappear, but those labouring under these diseases, when an harmattan comes on, are almost certain of a speedy recovery. Infection appears not then to be easily communicated even by art. In the year 1772, there were on board the Unity, at Whydah, above 300 slaves; the smallpox broke out among them, and it was determined to inoculate; those who were inoculated before the harmattan came on, got very well through the disease. About 70 were inoculated a day or two after the harmattan set in, but no one of them had either sickness or eruption. It was imagined that the infection was effectually dispersed, and the ship clear of the disorder; but in a very few weeks it began to appear among those seventy. About 50 of them were inoculated the second time; the others had the disease in a natural way: an harmattan came on, and they all recovered, excepting one girl, who had an ugly ulcer on the inoculated part, and died some time afterwards of a locked jaw.\n\nThis account differs remarkably from that given by Dr Lind, who calls the harmattan a malignant and fatal wind: (See his Diseases of Hot Climates.) As to the nature of the soil over which it blows, it appears that, excepting a few rivers and some lakes, the country about and beyond Whydah is covered for 400 miles back with verdure, open plains of grass, clumps of trees, and some woods of no considerable extent. The surface is sandy, and below that a rich reddish earth. It rises with a gentle ascent for 150 miles from the sea, before there is the appearance of a hill, without affording a stone of the size of a walnut. Beyond these hills there is no account of any great ranges of mountains.\n\nHARMODIUS, a friend of Aristogiton, who delivered his country from the tyranny of the Pisistratidae. (See ARISTOGITON.) The Athenians, to reward the patriotism of these illustrious citizens, made a law that no one should ever after bear the name of Aristogiton or Harmodius.\n\nHARMONIA, in fabulous history, the wife of Cadmus, both of whom were turned into serpents. See CADMUS.\n\nThough many of the ancient authors make Harmonia a princess of divine origin, there is a passage in Athenaeus from Euhemerus, the Vanini of his time, which tells us, that she was by profession a player on the flute, and in the service of the prince of Zidon previous to her departure with Cadmus. This circumstance, however, might encourage the belief, that as Cadmus brought letters into Greece, his wife brought harmony thither; as the word ἀρμονία, harmonia, has been said to have no other derivation than from her name: which makes it very difficult to ascertain the feme in which the Greeks made use of it in their music; for it has no roots by which it can be decomposed. The common account of the word, however, that is given by lexicographers, and generally adopted by the\nHarmonic, the learned, does not confirm this opinion. It is generally derived from ἁρμόνια, and this from the old verb ἁρμόνω, apto, to fit or join.\n\n**Harmonic.** As an adjective it signifies in general any thing belonging to harmony; though in our language the adjective is more properly written harmonical. In this case it may be applied to the harmonical divisions or a monochord; or, in a word, to consonances in general. As a substantive neuter, it imports all the concomitant or accessory sounds which, upon the principles resulting from the experiments made on sonorous bodies, attend any given sound whatever, and render it appreciable. Thus all the aliquot parts of a musical string produce harmonical sounds, or harmonics.\n\n**Harmonica.** This word, when originally appropriated by Dr Franklin to that peculiar form or mode of musical glasses, which he himself, after a number of happy experiments, had constituted, was written Armonica. In this place, however, we have ventured to restore it to its native plenitude of sound, as we have no antipathy against the moderate use of aspirations. It is derived from the Greek word ἁρμόνια. The radical word is ἁρμόνω, to fit or fit one thing to another. By the word ἁρμόνια the Greeks expressed aptitudes of various kinds; and from the use which they made of that expression, we have reason to conclude, that it was intended to import the highest degree of refinement and delicacy in those relations which it was meant to signify. Relations or aptitudes of sound, in particular, were understood by it; and in this view, Dr Franklin could not have selected a name more expressive of its nature and genius, for the instrument which we are now to describe; as, perhaps, no musical tones can possibly be finer, nor consequently susceptible of juster concords, than those which it produces.\n\nIn an old English book, whose title we cannot at present recollect, and in which a number of various amusements were described, we remember to have seen the elements or first approaches to music by glasses. That author enjoins his pupil to choose half a dozen of such as are used in drinking; to fill each of them with water in proportion to the gravity or acuteness of the sound which he intended it should produce; and having thus adjusted them one to another, he might entertain the company with a church-tune. These, perhaps were the rude and barbarous hints which Mr Puckeridge afterwards improved. But, for a farther account of him, of the state in which he left the instrument, and of the state to which it has afterwards been carried, we must refer our readers to the following extracts from Dr Franklin's letters, and from others who have written upon the same subject.\n\nThe Doctor, in his letter to Father Beccaria, has given a minute and elegant account of the Harmonica. Nor does it appear that his successors have either more sensibly improved, or more accurately delineated, that angelic instrument. The detail of his own improvements, therefore, shall be given in his own words.\n\n\"Perhaps (says he) it may be agreeable to you, as you live in a musical country, to have an account of the new instrument lately added here to the great number that charming science was possessed of before. As it is an instrument that seems peculiarly adapted to Italian music, especially that of the soft and plaintive kind, I will endeavour to give you such a description of it, and of the manner of constructing it, that you or any of your friends may be enabled to imitate it, if you incline so to do, without being at the expense and trouble of the many experiments I have made in endeavouring to bring it to its present perfection.\n\n\"You have doubtless heard the sweet tone that is drawn from a drinking-glass, by pressing a wet finger round its brim. One Mr Puckeridge, a gentleman from Ireland, was the first who thought of playing tunes formed of these tones. He collected a number of glasses of different sizes; fixed them near each other on a table; and tuned them, by putting into them water, more or less as each note required. The tones were brought out by pressing his fingers round their brims. He was unfortunately burnt here, with his instrument, in a fire which consumed the house he lived in. Mr E. Delaval, a most ingenious member of our Royal Society, made one in imitation of it with a better choice and form of glasses, which was the first I saw or heard. Being charmed with the sweetness of its tones, and the music he produced from it, I wished to see the glasses disposed in a more convenient form, and brought together in a narrower compass, so as to admit of a greater number of tones, and all within reach of hand to a person sitting before the instrument; which I accomplished, after various intermediate trials, and less commodious forms, both of glasses and construction, in the following manner.\n\n\"The glasses are blown as near as possible in the form of hemispheres, having each an open neck or socket in the middle. The thickness of the glass near the brim is about the tenth of an inch, or hardly quite too much, but thicker as it comes nearer the neck; which in the largest glasses is about an inch deep, and an inch and a half wide within; these dimensions lessening as the glasses themselves diminish in size, except that the neck of the smallest ought not to be shorter than half an inch. The largest glass is nine inches diameter, and the smallest three inches. Between these there are 23 different sizes, differing from each other a quarter of an inch in diameter. To make a single instrument there should be at least five glasses blown of each size; and out of this number one may probably pick 37 glasses (which are sufficient for three octaves with all the semitones) that will be each either the note one wants, or a little sharper than that note, and all fitting so well into each other as to taper pretty regularly from the largest to the smallest. It is true there are not 37 sizes; but it often happens that two of the same size differ a note or half a note in tone, by reason of a difference in thickness, and these may be placed one in the other without sensibly hurting the regularity of the taper form.\n\n\"The glasses being chosen, and every one marked with a diamond the note you intend it for, they are to be tuned by diminishing the thickness of those that are too sharp. This is done by grinding them round from the neck towards the brim, the breadth of one or two inches as may be required; often trying the glass by a well tuned harpsichord, comparing the note drawn from the glass by your finger with the note you want, as founded by that string of the harp-chord.\"\nWhen you come near the matter, be careful to wipe the glass clean and dry before each trial, because the tone is something flatter when the glass is wet than it will be when dry—and grinding a very little between each trial, you will thereby tune to great exactness. The more care is necessary in this, because if you go below your required tone, there is no sharpening it again but by grinding somewhat off the brim, which will afterwards require polishing, and thus increase the trouble.\n\nThe glasses being thus tuned, you are to be provided with a case for them, and a spindle on which they are to be fixed. My case is about three feet long, eleven inches every way wide within at the biggest end, and five inches at the smallest end; for it tapers all the way, to adapt it better to the conical figure of the set of glasses. This case opens in the middle of its height, and the upper part turns up by hinges fixed behind. The spindle is of hard iron, lies horizontally from end to end of the box within, exactly in the middle, and is made to turn on brass gudgeons at each end. It is round, an inch diameter at the thickest end, and tapering to a quarter of an inch at the smallest. —A square flank comes from its upper end through the box, on which flank a wheel is fixed by a screw. This wheel serves as a fly to make the motion equable, when the spindle, with the glasses, is turned by the foot like a spinning-wheel. My wheel is of mahogany, 18 inches diameter, and pretty thick, so as to conceal near its circumference about 25 lb. of lead.—An ivory pin is fixed in the face of this wheel, about four inches from the axis. Over the neck of this pin is put the loop of the string that comes up from the moveable stop to give it motion. The case stands on a neat frame with four legs.\n\nTo fix the glasses on the spindle, a cork is first to be fitted in each neck pretty tight, and projecting a little without the neck, that the neck of one may not touch the inside of another when put together, for that would make a jarring. These corks are to be perforated with holes of different diameters, so as to suit that part of the spindle on which they are to be fixed. When a glass is put on, by holding it stiffly between both hands, while another turns the spindle, it may be gradually brought to its place. But care must be taken that the hole be not too small, lest in forcing it up, the neck should split; nor too large, lest the glass, not being firmly fixed, should turn or move on the spindle, so as to touch or jar against its neighbouring glasses. The glasses thus are placed one in another; the largest on the biggest end of the spindle, which is to the left hand; the neck of this glass is towards the wheel; and the next goes into it in the same position, only about an inch of its brim appearing beyond the brim of the first; thus proceeding, every glass when fixed shows about an inch of its brim (or three quarters of an inch, or half an inch, as they grow smaller) beyond the brim of the glass that contains it; and it is from these exposed parts of each glass that the tone is drawn, by laying a finger on one of them as the spindle and glasses turn round.\n\nMy largest glass is G a little below the reach of a common voice, and my highest G, including three complete octaves.—To distinguish the glasses more readily to the eye, I have painted the apparent parts of the glasses within-side, every semitone white, and the other notes of the octave with the seven prismatic colours: viz. C, red; D, orange; E, yellow; F, green; G, blue; A, indigo; B, purple; and G, red again;—so that the glasses of the same colour (the white excepted) are always octaves to each other.\n\nThis instrument is played upon by fitting before the middle of the set of glasses, as before the keys of a harpsichord, turning them with the foot, and wetting them now and then with a sponge and clean water. The fingers should be first a little soaked in water, and quite free from all greasiness; a little fine chalk upon them is sometimes useful, to make them catch the glasses and bring out the tone more readily. Both hands are used, by which means different parts are played together. Observe, that the tones are best drawn out when the glasses turn from the ends of the fingers, not when they turn to them.\n\nThe advantages of this instrument are, that its tones are incomparably sweet beyond those of any other; that they may be swelled and softened at pleasure by stronger or weaker pressures of the finger, and continued to any length; and that the instrument, being once well tuned, never again wants tuning.\n\nSuch was the state in which this learned and ingenious author found, and such the perfection to which he carried, that celestial instrument of which we now treat. We call it celestial; because, in comparison with any other instrument which we know, the sounds that it produces are indeed heavenly. Some of them, however, are still constructed in the same imperfect manner as the instrument of Mr Puckeridge. They are contained in an oblong chest; their positions are either exactly or nearly rectilineal; the artificial semitones by which the full notes are divided form another parallel line; but the distances between each of them are much greater than those between the notes of the natural scale, as they take their places, not directly opposite to the notes which they are intended to heighten or depress, but in a situation between the highest and lowest, to show, that in ascending they are sharps to the one, and in descending flats to the other. This structure, however, is doubly inconvenient; for it not only increases the labour and difficulty of the performer, but renders some musical operations impracticable, which upon the Harmonica, as constituted by Dr Franklin, may be executed with ease and pleasure. In this fabric, if properly formed and accurately tuned, the instrument is equally adapted to harmony and melody. But as no material structure could ever yet be brought to the perfection even of human ideas, this instrument still in some measure retains the perverse nature of its original stamina. Hence it is not without the utmost difficulty that the glasses can be tuned by grinding; and the least conceivable redundancy or defect renders the discord upon this instrument more conspicuous and intolerable than upon any other. Hence likewise that inexplicable delicacy to be observed in the manner of the friction by which the sound is produced; for if the touch be too gentle, it cannot extort the tone; and if too strong, besides the mellow and delicate sound which ought to be heard, we likewise perceive the finger jarring upon the glass, which, mingled with those softer sounds by which the senses had been foreshadowed, gives a feeling similar to iron grating upon iron.\nHarmonica iron, but more disagreeable. In wind-instruments the operation of the tongue, in harpsichords the stroke of the quill, and on the violin the motion of the bow, gives the strong and sensible interruption of sound which may be called articulation, and which renders the rhythmus or measure of an air more perceptible; but upon the glafes, the touch of the finger is too soft to divide the notes with so much force; so that, unless the mind be steadily attentive, they seem to melt one into another, by which means the idea of rhythmus is almost lost. There is no way of performing a flur but by forbearing to stop the first sound, when that which is immediately subsequent commences. Thus, when the flur is of any length, and regularly descends or rises by the interval of a second, all the notes in the flur must be heard together, and produce no disagreeable dissonance; yet if it rises or descends by perfect chords, the effect is pleasing. The open shake, or trill, is another unhappy operation upon musical glafes; which can only be performed by the alternate pulsations of two continued sounds, differing from each other only by a note or semitone. But as these pulsations thus managed cannot be distinct, the result is far from being pleasant; nor is there any succedaneum for the close shake, which in the violin is performed by alternately depressing the string to the finger-board, and suffering it to rise without entirely removing the finger from it, and which, by giving the note that tremulous sound produced by the human voice affected with grief, is a grace peculiarly adapted to pathetic and plaintive airs.\n\nWe proceed, however, to a farther account of the same instrument, extracted from the Annual Register, vol. iv. p. 149.\n\n\"Besides those tones, (says the author of that account) which every elastic string produces by a vibration of all its parts, it is capable of another set of tones in which only a part of the string is supposed to vibrate. These sounds are produced by the lightest touches, either by air, as in Oswald's lyre, or by rubbing the bow in the softest manner on the string of a fiddle.\n\n\"Analogous to these sounds are those produced by bells: in these last, besides those tones produced by their elliptical vibrations, there are a set of tones which may be brought by gently rubbing their edges, and in which the whole instrument does not appear to vibrate in all its parts as before.\n\n\"Take, for instance, a bell finely polished at the edges; or, what will perhaps be more convenient, a drinking-glass: let the edges be as free from anything oily as possible; then, by moistening the finger in water (I have found alum-water to be best), and rubbing it circularly round the edge of the glass, you will at length bring out the tone referred to.\n\n\"This note is pollihed of infinite sweetness; it has all the excellencies of the tone of a bell without its defects. It is loud, has a sufficient body, is capable of being swelled and continued at pleasure; and, besides, has naturally that vibratory softening which musicians endeavour to imitate by mixing with the note to be played a quarter-tone from below.\n\n\"To vary these tones, nothing more is required than to procure several bells or glasses of different tones, tuned as nearly as possible, which may be done by thin-\n\nning the edges of either: or, for immediate satisfaction, the glasses may be tuned by pouring in water: the more water is poured in, the graver the tone will be.\n\n\"Let us suppose then a double octave of these glasses, thus tuned, to be procured. Any common tune may be executed by the fingers rubbing upon each glass successively; and this I have frequently done without the least difficulty, only choosing those tunes which are slow and easy. Here then are numbers of delicate tones, with which musicians have been till very lately unacquainted; and the only defect is, that they cannot be made to follow each other with that celerity and ease which is requisite for melody. In order to remedy this, I took a large drinking-glass, and by means of a wheel and gut, as in the electrical machine, made it to turn upon its axis with a moderately quick but equable motion; then moistening the finger as before, nothing more was required than merely to touch the glass at the edge, without any other motion, in order to bring out the tone.\n\n\"Instead of one glass only turning in this manner, if the whole number of glasses were so fixed as to keep continually turning by means of a wheel, it follows, that upon every touch of the finger a note would be expressed; and thus, by touching several glasses at once, an harmony of notes might be produced, as in a harpsichord.\n\n\"As I write rather to excite than satisfy the curious, I shall not pretend to direct the various ways this number of glasses may be contrived to turn; it may be sufficient to say, that if the glasses are placed in the segment of a circle, and then a strap, as in a cutter's wheel, be supposed to go round them all, the whole number will by this means be made to turn by means of a wheel.\n\n\"Instead of the finger, I have applied moistened leather to the edge of the glass, in order to bring out the tone: but, for want of a proper elasticity, this did not succeed. I tried cork, and this answered every purpose of the finger; but made the tone much louder than the finger could do. Instead, therefore, of the finger, if a number of corks were so contrived as to fall with a proper degree of pressure on the edge of the glass, by means of keys like the jacks of an organ, it is evident, that in such a case a new and tolerably perfect instrument would be produced; not so loud indeed as some, but infinitely more melodious than any.\n\n\"The mouths of the glasses or bells used in this experiment should not resemble the mouth of a trumpet, but should rather come forward with a perpendicular edge. The corks used in this case should be smooth, even free from those blemishes which are usually found in them, and at the same time the more elastic the better.\"\n\nIn the two accounts here given seems to be comprehended every thing valuable which has been said upon the subject. It remains, however, our permanent opinion, that the form and structure designed and constructed by Dr Franklin is by much the most eligible; nor can we admit, that a cork, however successfully applied, will produce the same mellowness and equality of tone in general with the finger. It appears to us, that, by this kind of voluntary attrition, a note may be...\nHarmonica: sunk or swelled with much more art and propriety than by the substitution of any thing else extrinsic to the hand; and when chords are long protracted, that degree of friction, which renders every sound in the chord tolerable to the ear, without harshness, must be the most agreeable. For this reason, likewise, we should recommend alum-water in preference to chalk.\n\nFrom what has already been said, it will easily be perceived, that this instrument requires to be tuned with the nicest degree of delicacy which the laws of temperament will possibly admit. For these laws the reader will naturally have recourse to the article MUSIC*, in this Dictionary; where, from M. D'Alembert, is given a plain and satisfactory account, both of the method proposed by Rameau, and of that established in common practice, without anticipating the experience and taste of the reader, by dictating which of these plans is preferable. To those who have occasion to tune the instrument, it may likewise be useful to peruse the detailed article TEMPERAMENT in this Work. Without recapitulating the different rules of alteration prescribed in these accounts, we shall presuppose the reader acquainted with them; and proceed to describe how, under their influence, the Harmonica may be tuned. But it is previously expedient to observe, that the same rules which conduct the process of tuning a harpsichord, will be equally effectual in tuning the Harmonica; with this only difference, that greater delicacy in adjusting the chords should, if practicable, be attempted.\n\nThere are different notes from whence the procedure of tuning may commence. La or A, which is the key that pretty nearly divides the harpsichord, is chosen by some; this la in common spinets is 24 natural keys from the bottom, and 13 from the top; and the ut above it, or second C upon the G cliff, by others. This last we should rather advise, because we imagine those intervals which we have called seconds major to be more just through the whole octave, when the course of tuning is begun by a natural semitone. The initiate, therefore, may begin by tuning the second ut of his Harmonica, or C above the treble cliff, union with its correspondent C upon the harpsichord or any other instrument in concert pitch; then, descending to its octave below, adjust it with the ut above, till every pulsation if possible be lost, and the sounds rendered fearlessly distinguishable when simultaneously heard. To the lowest note of this octave he must tune the sol or G immediately above it by a fifth, still observing the laws of temperament: To this G, the re, or D immediately above it, by the same chord: To the re, or D above, its octave below: To this, by a fifth, the la or A immediately above it: To la, the mi or E ascending in the same proportion: To mi, its octave below: To this, the fa or B immediately above it by a fifth: To the first ut, or C, which was tuned, the fa or F immediately below by the same chord.\n\nThat the practitioner may be still more secure in the justice and propriety of his procedure, he may try the thirds of the notes already adjusted, and alter, as much as is consistent with the fifths and octaves, such among these thirds as may seem grating and disagreeable to his ear. Thus far having accomplished his operation, he may tune all the other natural notes whether above or below by octaves. His next concern is with the semi-tones. And here it will be suggested by common Harmonica, sense, that as in all instruments with fixed scales, the sharp of a lower must likewise answer for the flat of a higher tone, the semitone ought as nearly as possible to divide the interval. He may begin with la or A sharp; which la in its natural state is a third minor beneath the ut or C, from whence he began in the natural scale. This semitone should correspond with the F natural immediately above by a fifth. To it may be tuned the re or D sharp immediately below by a similar chord: To D sharp, its octave above: To fa or B natural, immediately above the la or A first mentioned, may be adjusted the F or fa sharp immediately above it: To this its octave below: To that octave, the C or ut sharp above by a fifth: To the C sharp, its octave below: To this, by a fifth, the G or sol sharp above. Between this G sharp and the D sharp immediately above it, the fifth will probably be too sharp; but if the others are justly tuned, that discord will not be extremely offensive; and it is a necessary consequence of temperament. The rest of the sharps and flats, like their naturals, whether ascending or descending, may be tuned by their octaves.\n\nThe notes, with their chords, may be expressed by letters and figures, thus; where, however, it must be observed, that the higher notes of any chord are marked with larger capitals. It should likewise be remarked, that the figures are not expressive of the different ratios which the notes bear to one another, considered with respect to their vibrations; but only significant of their nominal distances, according to the received denominations of the intervals. Cc CG CD DD DA AE EE EB CF. The sharps and flats thus, A X F#, A X G#, D X D#, D X F#, F X F#, F X G#, C X C#, C X G#. In running over the sharps and flats as the naturals, it will likewise be necessary to try the thirds, and to alter such as may offend the ear; which, if cautiously done, will not sensibly injure the other chords.\n\n—Though this article has been protracted to a length which we did not originally intend, we have however the satisfaction to find, that it comprehends every thing essential; so that any person who understands the nature of chords, and the practical principles of music as universally taught, may not only be able to tune his instrument, but to acquire its whole manoeuvre, without the least assistance from a master. On Plate CCL. is represented an instrument of this kind.\n\nThough this topic appeared in itself complete in the former edition of this extensive work, yet having since received from Dr Edmund Cullen of Dublin the following observations, and reflecting that men of musical talents have not only different tastes, but different powers of mechanical operation, we have thought it proper to submit to the choice of our readers, either Dr Franklin's form and arrangement of the glafes, or that which was adopted by Dr Cullen; but in either case, we would recommend it to the initiate in this instrument, to distinguish by colours, according to Dr Franklin, the notes and semitones. We likewise cannot forbear to think, that the complete bals practicable on the harmonica, is by many degrees preferable to the chords with which Dr Cullen proposed to grace every emphatic\nHarmonica emphatic note, with which, from the structure and arrangement of his instrument, he was under the necessity of deluding instead of satisfying the ear, with the full effect of the regular procedure of the treble and bass upon the same instrument.\n\nThis instrument the doctor describes as consisting \"of 35 glases of different sizes, answering to so many distinct sounds, and ranged in the manner hereafter to be described. They are exactly of the form of a cocoa nut when the usual quantity of the top is cut off; or the sugar-bowls made of cocoa-nut shells so much in use will give a precise idea of their figure. They are blown with plain long stalks, which are fitted to wooden feet screwed on a board at proper distances, in such a manner that the circular tops of all may be in the same horizontal plane, at the distance of about an inch apart. Of these 35, 10 only are allotted for half tones; there remain therefore 25 for the diatonic scale. The lowest note corresponds to G in the bass clef; hence it extends upward to the octave above C in alt. For uniformity, take the glasses which are chosen gradually and regularly diminishing in size as they ascend in tone. This, however, is not absolutely necessary, as the tone of the glass does not entirely depend upon its size, but in a great measure upon the proportion of its different parts to one another: hence the glass corresponding to one note may be smaller than a glass corresponding to a note three or four times higher; however, where it is practicable, they should always be chosen gradually diminishing as they ascend, both on account of the elegance of appearance, and that an equality in point of loudness may be preferred; for, as everybody knows, an instrument may be liable to great inequality in point of strength, though perfectly in tune. This must have a very bad effect; and therefore we find performers on the violin and other instruments of that kind very solicitous about the proportional thickness of their strings.\n\nThe glasses being chosen in the best manner circumstances will permit, we proceed to arrange them. Here let me observe, that in general the diameter of the largest glass at its mouth is about seven inches, and its solid contents about five English pints, while the height is of about one-fourth of an inch, and its contents about one-third of a gill: this, however, is arbitrary, and depends upon the pitch of the instrument. In arranging the glasses, we shall, to avoid confusion, take the diatonic scale first, and afterwards the half tones will be easily understood. The wooden feet before mentioned are to be screwed on a strong board of a proper size, and they are disposed at convenient intervals in rows perpendicular to the longest sides of the rectangular board on which they stand. In these feet the glasses are disposed in the following manner: Beginning with the lowest note G, we fix that on the foot which stands in the nearest angle of the board on the left hand, A in the next bottom in the same perpendicular line, B in the third: when we come to C, however, we do not place it in the same perpendicular line, but in the nearest bottom of the second perpendicular row to the left hand, D in the second of the same row, E in the third; F again in the nearest bottom of the third row, G in the second of the same row, A in the third; B again in the nearest bottom of the fourth row, C in the second of the same, and so on. By this contrivance, it is easy to see an immense compass is obtained: so great a one indeed, that if the glasses were disposed according to the old method, regularly ascending in a line parallel to the front of the instrument, to take in the same compass, it must stretch to a considerable length, no less than a length equal to the sum of all the perpendiculars we before spoke of, which in ordinary size of the glasses would amount to upwards of 16 feet; the inconvenience of which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. As to the half tones, perhaps a more judicious and convenient arrangement may be thought of for them: but the present mode is far from inconvenient, except in some keys; and it is sufficiently commodious for performing such airs as are best suited to the nature and design of the instrument. After explaining the arrangement, we shall speak somewhat more exactly of them. Ed on the first line of the treble staff stands in the fourth bottom of the first perpendicular row to the left hand; Fg on the first space stands in the fourth place of the second row, Gg on the second line of the treble staff stands in the fourth of the third row, Ch on the third space of the same staff stands in the same manner in the fourth row, and so on, ascending Fg in the fifth row, Gg in the sixth, Ag in the seventh, Bg in the eighth. In the ninth perpendicular row, that is, the last to the right hand in the diatonic scale, stands C alone; but immediately behind is placed By of the middle line of the treble staff, and again behind it Dg of the fourth line of the treble staff, which finishes the whole. There is something fingerless, and perhaps whimsical, in the distribution of the half tones: but it is found sufficiently convenient; and if a better is thought of, it may easily be adopted. In the mean time I must observe, that two of them, viz. Ch and Fg, standing immediately behind the D and G respectively above them, are singularly well fitted for performing running passages either up or down in the key of G. Ex gr. let us suppose that we have that very common A, G, Fg, Eg, semiquavers. Here the performer touches A, which is in the first place of the sixth row, with his left hand, G with the forefinger of his right, Fg with the middle, and E again with the left hand; in the same manner may E, D, Ch, and B, be played, or upwards by inverting the motion: Thus we can with the utmost ease run either up or down two very frequent passages, in a key which might naturally be supposed difficult upon this instrument, and that with any given rapidity. I wish as much could be said of all the other half tones, of which, by the bye, some are altogether wanting: it is obvious, however, that they may easily be added, if we can find convenient places; and I apprehend even that very practicable. Be that as it may, notwithstanding the seemingly inconvenient situation of some half tones, and the total want of others, pieces may be performed on this instrument of considerable rapidity. I myself, though very far from being an accomplished player, can with great ease go through all the parts of Fther's celebrated rondos; nay, I have heard the fifth concerto of Vivaldi played upon it with as much distinctness as upon a violin. The glasses are not necessarily chosen perfectly in tune, but are tuned by the help of a quantity of water. Here, however, two cautions are necessary: 1st, By no means to take a glass which is, when without water, flatter than the note you intend; as in that case you cannot remedy it, the water making.\nmaking the tone still flatter; rather let it be somewhat sharper, and you may tune it to the utmost nicety by a little water. The second caution is, not to choose a glass which is very much sharper than the note required; as in that case, so large a quantity of water will be required to tune it as will entirely smother the tone.\n\n\"This instrument is to be played somewhat in the manner of the harmonica, viz., the fingers are to be well wetted; and by the application of them to the side, assisted by a proper motion, the sound is produced. And here I would observe, that the proper motion is, to make the fingers follow the thumb, not the thumb follow the fingers, in going round the glasses; it is necessary also to preserve the circular motion very exactly, as the least deviation from it produces the most horrible sound that can be conceived. It is likewise to be observed, that you must touch the smaller glasses upon the very top of the brim; and for that purpose the palm of the hand must be nearly parallel to the top of the glasses; but in coming to the larger glasses, it is absolutely necessary to make the fingers touch the side, not the top of the glasses; and the larger the glasses, the more distant from the top must they be touched. Practice alone can determine this matter.\n\n\"From this disposition of the glasses, it is easy to see that the perfect chord of C is always most completely in our power, namely, by using different fingers to the different notes at the same time: and although a full bass cannot be executed upon this instrument, we have always a great number of accompaniments which can easily be introduced; more perhaps than upon any instrument, the organ and others of that species excepted. The thirds or fifths occasionally can be introduced; and when done with taste and judgment, will scarcely yield to a middling bass. If to this is added the thrilling softness of the tones, imitable by any other substance, it will readily appear to be an instrument more in the true style of music, of that music which the heart acknowledges, than any that either chance or ingenuity has hitherto produced. It is indeed incapable of that whimsical subdivision to which the taste of modern composers, that sworn enemy to harmony and real music, leads; which serves no end but to exhibit the wonderful executions of a favourite performer, and to overwhelm his hearers with stupid admiration. This is not music; and upon these occasions, though I acknowledge the difficulty of doing what I feel done, I lament that the honest man has taken so much pains to do little purpose. Our instrument is not capable of this (at least not in so exquisite a degree as the harpsichord, violin, and a few others): yet if the true and original intent of music is not to astonish but to please, if that instrument which most readily and pleasingly seizes the heart through the ears is the best, I have not a moment's hesitation in setting it down the first of all musical instruments. There is but one which will in any degree bear the comparison, or rather they are the same instrument, I mean Dr Franklin's harmonica: but I am inclined to think that the instrument we have been speaking of has some superiority over the harmonica. The first striking difference is in the impracticability of executing quick passages on the latter; whereas it is in most cases extremely easy on the other. Again, the very long continued vibration of the glasses, inevitably must produce horrible discord, or at least confusion, except the piece played be so slow that the vibration of one glass be nearly over before the other is heard. Now, in our instrument, this may be remedied by laying pieces of sponge lightly between the glasses, so as to allow them only the proper extent of vibration. This, however, is an exceptionable method: and it is much better done by the touch of the performer's finger, which instantly stops the vibration; and the use of this may be learned by a very little practice, the motion here being entirely voluntary: But in the harmonica, the motion being partly mechanical, viz., the rotation of the glasses, this cannot be done; and for the same reason, in the execution of the crescendo the harmonica is not so perfect as this instrument. Besides, the inconvenience of tuning the half tones, as sharps or flats, separately, is as great in the harmonica as in the harpsichord. This is a very great imperfection; as half tones, being tuned at the medium, are false both as sharps and as flats. The learned Dr Smith says, there is no less than one fifth of the interval difference between the sharp of one note and the flat of the next above; and for this purpose proposes to have an harpsichord constructed with a stop, so as to direct the jacks to the sharps or flats according to the prevalence of either in the piece to be played: but in our instrument, from its very construction, this inconvenience is avoided. As to matters of convenience, the harmonica is exceedingly apt to be out of order; the glasses frequently break, plainly on account of the great strain upon them where they join the spindle, and are thus with much difficulty renewed; whereas with us the loss of a glass is nothing. Add to all this, that the harmonica, in point of original expense, is about five times as high as the other; although I apprehend it possesses no one advantage, except that the performer may sit at it; whereas with our instrument it is convenient, if not necessary, to stand; but he must be a lazy musician that gives himself much concern about that; And if he will sit at our instrument, he may, though at the expense of much ease in point of execution.\n\n\"Let us now consider some objections that have been made to this instrument. One is, that necessity of standing, in order to do anything capital upon it. But is not that the case in all instruments, except where the performer sits at necessity? Did ever anyone see Giardini or Fisher play a solo sitting? But for the satisfaction of these torpid gentlemen, I can faithfully assure them, I knew a lady who performed on this instrument perfectly well, though she had lost the use of both her legs. A more serious and important objection lies both to this and the harmonica, viz., the want of a shake. How this is supplied upon the harmonica, I cannot say, as I never saw it even attempted: but on our instrument, although a very perfect shake can scarcely be produced, something so like it may be done as will fairly excuse the want; and that is, by whirling the two stands round the note concerned with the shake with the utmost velocity, beginning the lower note a little sooner than the other. By this means, except in very large glasses where the vibrations are too distant in time, such an intermixture of the two sounds is produced, as extremely well imitates a fine shake, and the dexterous performer will make the beat in a turned shake with a spare finger. This operation requires some dexterity;\nHarmony. dexterity; but this is a charge common to all musical instruments; and I question not but that the Highland bagpipe itself requires some sort of skill.\n\n\"Upon the whole, I am clearly of opinion, that the harmonica, and more especially this instrument which has yet got no name, is the most exquisite and noble present that the lovers of true harmony have ever yet received; and it is with much astonishment I find this invaluable treasure almost entirely confined to Ireland, a country not very remarkable for musical taste or talents: But I hope soon to see this elegant species of music very generally known and practised over all Europe.\"\n\nHARMONY. The sense which the Greeks gave to this word in their music, is so much less easy to be determined, because, the word itself being originally a substantive proper, it has no radical words by which we might analyse it, to discover its etymology. In the ancient treatises which remain to us, harmony appears to be that department whose object is the agreeable succession of sounds, merely considered as high or low; in opposition to the two others called rhythmica and metrica, which have their principle in time and measure. This leaves our ideas concerning that aptitude of found vague and undetermined; nor can we fix them without studying for that purpose all the rules of the art; and even after we have done so, it will be very difficult to distinguish harmony from melody, unless we add to the last the ideas of rhythm and measure; without which, in reality, no melody can have a distinguishing character; whereas harmony is characterized by its own nature, independent of all other quantities except the chords or intervals which compose it.\n\nIt appears by a passage of Nicomachus, and, by others, that they likewise gave the name of harmony to the chord of an octave, and to concerts of voices and instruments, which performed in the distance of an octave one from the other, and which is more commonly called antiphone.\n\nHarmony, according to the moderns, is a succession of chords agreeable to the laws of modulation. For a long time this harmony had no other principle but such rules as were almost arbitrary, or solely founded on the approbation of a practised ear, which decided concerning the agreeable or disagreeable succession of chords, and whose determinations were at last reduced to calculation. But Father Merenne and M. Sauveur having found that every sound, however simple in appearance, was always accompanied with other sounds less sensible, which constitute with itself a perfect chord-major; with this experiment M. Rameau set out, and upon it formed the basis of his harmonic system, which he has extended to a great many volumes, and which at last M. D'Alembert has taken the trouble of explaining to the public.\n\nSignor Tartini, taking his route from an experiment which is newer and more delicate, yet no less certain, has reached conclusions similar enough to those of Rameau, by pursuing a path whose direction seems quite opposite. According to M. Rameau, the treble is generated by the bass; Signor Tartini makes the bass result from the treble. One deduces harmony from melody, and the other supposes quite the contrary. To determine from which of the two schools the best performances are likely to proceed, no more is necessary than to investigate the end of the composer, and discover whether the air is made for the accompaniments, or the accompaniments for the air. At the word System in Rouffleau's Musical Dictionary, is given a delineation of that published by Signor Tartini. Here he continues to speak of M. Rameau, whom he has followed through this whole work, as the artist of greatest authority in the country where he writes.\n\nHe thinks himself obliged, however, to declare, That this system, however ingenious it may be, is far from being founded upon nature; an affirmation which he incessantly repeats: \"That it is only established upon analogies and congruities, which a man of invention may overturn to-morrow, by substituting others more natural: that, in short, of the experiments from whence he deduces it, one is detected fallacious, and the other will not yield him the consequences which he would extort from it. In reality, when this author took it into his head to dignify with the title of demonstration the reasoning upon which he established his theory, every one turned the arrogant pretence into ridicule. The Academy of Sciences loudly disapproved a title so ill founded, and so gratuitously assumed; and M. Elève, of the Royal Society at Montpellier, has shown him, that even to begin with this proposition, That according to the law of nature, sounds are represented by their octaves, and that the octaves may be substituted for them, there was not any one thing demonstrated, or even firmly established, in his pretended demonstration.\" He returns to his system.\n\n\"The mechanical principle of resonance presents us with nothing but independent and solitary chords; it neither prescribes nor establishes their succession. Yet a regular succession is necessary; a dictionary of selected words is not an oration, nor a collection of legitimate chords a piece of music: there must be a meaning, there must be connections in music as well as in language: it is necessary that what has preceded should transmit something of its nature to what is subsequent, so that all the parts conjoined may form a whole, and be stamped with the genuine character of unity.\n\n\"Now, the complex sensation which results from a perfect chord must be resolved into the simple sensation of each particular sound which composes it, and into the sensation of each particular interval which forms it, ascertained by comparison one with another. Beyond this there is nothing sensible in any chord; from whence it follows, that it is only by the relation between sounds, and by the analogy between intervals, that the connexion now in question can be established; and this is the genuine, the only source, from whence flow all the laws of harmony and modulation. If, then, the whole of harmony were only formed by a succession of perfect chords-major, it would be sufficient to proceed by intervals similar to those which compose such a chord; for then some one or more sounds of the preceding chord being necessarily protracted in that which is subsequent, all the chords would be found sufficiently connected; and the harmony would, at least in this sense, be one.\n\n\"But besides that these successions must exclude all melody by excluding the diatonic series which forms its foundation,\"\nHarmony, foundation, it would not arrive at the real end of the art; because, as music is a system of meanings like a discourse, it ought, like a discourse, to have its periods, its phrases, its suppositions, its cadences, its punctuation of every kind; and because the uniformity of a harmonic procedure implies nothing of all this, diatonic procedures require that major and minor chords should be intermixed; and the necessity of dissonances has been felt in order to distinguish the phrases, and render the cadences sensible. Now, a connected series of perfect chords-major can neither be productive of perfect chords-minor nor of dissonances, nor can sensibly mark any musical phrase, and the punctuation must there be found entirely defective.\n\n\"M. Rameau being absolutely determined, in his system, to deduce from nature all the harmony practised among us, had recourse, for this effect, to another experiment of his own invention, of which I have formerly spoken, and which by a different arrangement is taken from the first. He pretended, that any simple sound whatever afforded in it multiplies a perfect minor or flat chord, of which it was the dominant or fifth, as it furnished a perfect chord-major by the vibration of its aliquot parts, of which it is the tonic or fundamental sound. He has affirmed as a certain fact, that a vocal string caused two others lower than itself to vibrate through their whole extent, yet without making them produce any sound, one to its twelfth major and the other to its seventeenth; and from this joined to the former fact, he has very ingeniously deduced not only the application of the minor mode and of dissonances in harmony, but the rules of harmonic phrases and of all modulation, such as they are found at the words Chord, Accompaniment, Fundamental Bass, Cadence, Dissonance, Modulation.\n\n\"But first (continues Rousseau), the experiment is false. It is discovered, that the strings tuned beneath the fundamental sound do not entirely vibrate when this fundamental sound is given; but that they are divided in such a manner as to return its unison alone, which of consequence can have no harmonics below. It is moreover discovered, that the property of strings in dividing themselves, is not peculiar to those which are tuned by a twelfth and seventeenth below the principal sound; but that oscillations are likewise produced in the lower strings by all its multiples. Whence it follows, that, the intervals of the twelfth and seventeenth below not being singular phenomena of their kind, nothing can be concluded in favour of the perfect minor chord which they represent.\n\n\"Though the truth of this experiment were granted, even this would by no means remove the difficulty. If, as M. Rameau alleges, all harmony is derived from the resonance of sonorous bodies, it cannot then be derived only from the vibrations of such bodies as do not resound. In reality, it is an extraordinary theory, to deduce from bodies that do not resound the principles of harmony; and it is a position in natural philosophy no less strange, that a sonorous body should vibrate without resounding, as if sound itself were anything else but the air impelled by these vibrations. Moreover, sonorous bodies do not only produce, besides the principal sound, the other tones which with itself compose a perfect chord; but an infinite number of other sounds, formed by all the aliquot parts of the bodies in vibration, which do not enter into that perfect harmony. Why then should the former sounds produce consonances, and why should the latter not produce them, since all of them equally result from nature?\n\n\"Every sound exhibits a chord truly perfect, since it is composed of all its harmonics, and since it is by them that it becomes a sound. Yet these harmonics are not heard, and nothing is distinguished but a simple sound, unless it be exceedingly strong: whence it follows, that the only good harmony is an unison; and that, as soon as the consonances can be distinguished, the natural proportion being altered, the harmony has lost its purity.\n\n\"That alteration is in this case produced two different ways. First, by causing certain harmonics to resound, and not the others, the proportion of force which ought to prevail in all of them is altered, for producing the sensation of a single sound; whence the unity of nature is destroyed. By doubling these harmonics, an effect is exhibited similar to that which would be produced by suppressing all the others; for in that case we cannot doubt, but that, along with the generating sound, the tones of the other harmonics which were permitted to sound would be heard: whereas, in leaving all of them to their natural operations, they destroy one another, and conspire together in forming and strengthening the simple sensation of the principal sound. It is the same effect which the full sound of a stop in the organ produces, when, by successively removing the stopper or register, the third and fifth are permitted to sound with the principal; for then that fifth and third, which remained absorbed in the other sounds, are separately and disagreeably distinguished by the ear.\n\n\"Moreover, the harmonics which we cause to sound have other harmonics pertaining to themselves, which cannot be such to the fundamental sound. It is by these additional harmonics that the sounds which produce them are distinguished with a more sensible degree of harshness; and these very harmonics which thus render the chord perceptible, do not enter into its harmony. This is the reason why the most perfect chords are naturally displeasing to ears whose relish for harmony is not sufficiently formed; and I have no hesitation in thinking, that even the octave itself might be displeasing, if the mixture of male and female voices did not inure us to that interval from our infancy.\n\n\"With dissonance it is still worse, because, not only the harmonics of the sound by which the discord is produced, but even the sound itself, is excluded from the natural harmony of the fundamental; which is the cause why discord is always distinguished amongst all the other sounds in a manner shocking to the senses.\n\n\"Every key of an organ, with the stop fully opened, gives a perfect chord with its third major, which are not distinguished from the fundamental sound, if the hearer is not extremely attentive, and if he does not sound the whole stop in succession; but these harmonic sounds are never observed in the fundamental, but on account of the prodigious noise, and by such a situation of the registers as may cause the pipes which produce the fundamental sound to conceal by their force the other sounds which produce these harmonics. Now,\nHarmony; no person observes, nor can observe, this continual proportion in a concert; since, by the manner of inverting the harmony, its greatest force must in every instant be transferred from one part to another; which is not practicable, and would destroy the whole melody.\n\n\"When we play upon the organ, every key in the bass causes to refund the perfect chord-major; but because that bass is not always fundamental, and because the music is often modulated in a perfect minor chord, this perfect chord-major is rarely struck with the right hand; so that we hear the third minor with the major, the fifth with the tritone, the seventh redundant with the octave, and a thousand other cacophonies, which, however, do not much disgust our ears, because habit renders them tractable; but it is not to be imagined that an ear naturally just would prove so patient of discords, when first exposed to the test of this harmony.\n\n\"M. Rameau pretends, that trebles composed with a certain degree of simplicity naturally suggest their own basses; and that any man having a just, though unpracticed ear, would spontaneously sing that bass. This is the prejudice of a musician, refuted by universal experience. Not only he, who has never heard either bass or harmony, be of himself incapable of finding either the bass or the harmony of M. Rameau, but they would be displeasing to him if he heard them, and he would greatly prefer the simple union.\n\n\"When we consider, that, of all the people upon earth, who have all of them some kind of music and melody, the Europeans are the only people who have a harmony consisting of chords, and who are pleased with this mixture of sounds; when we consider that the world has endured for so many ages, whilst, of all the nations which cultivated the fine arts, not one has found out this harmony; that not one animal, not one bird, not one being in nature, produces any other chord but the union, nor any other music but melody; that the eastern languages, so sonorous, so musical; that the ears of the Greeks, so delicate, so sensible, practised and cultivated with so much art, have never conducted this people, luxurious and enamoured of pleasure as they were, towards this harmony which we imagined so natural; that without it their music produced such astonishing effects; that with it ours is so impotent; that, in short, it was reserved for the people of the north, whose grofs and callous organs of sensation are more affected with the noise and clamour of voices, than with the sweetness of accents and the melody of inflections, to make this grand discovery, and to vend it as the essential principle upon which all the rules of the art were founded; when, in short, attention is paid to all these observations, it is very difficult not to suspect that all our harmony is nothing but a Gothic and barbarous invention, which would never have entered into our minds, had we been truly sensible to the genuine beauties of art, and of that music which is unquestionably natural.\n\n\"M. Rameau affirms, however, that harmony is the source of the most powerful charms in music. But this notion is contradictory both to reason and to matter of fact. To fact it is contradictory, because, since the invention of counter-point, all the wonderful effects of music have ceased, and it has lost its whole force and energy. To which may be added, that such Harmony, beauties as purely result from harmony are only perceived by the learned; that they affect none with transport but such as are deeply conversant in the art; whereas the real beauties of music, resulting from nature, ought to be, and certainly are, equally obvious to the adept and the novice. To reason it is contradictory; since harmony affords us no principle of imitation by which music, in forming images and expressing sentiments, can rise above its native excellence till it becomes in some measure dramatic or imitative, which is the highest pitch of elevation and energy to which the art can aspire; since all the pleasures which we can receive from the mere mechanical influence of sounds are extremely limited, and have very little power over the human heart.\"\n\nThus far we have heard M. Rousseau, in his observations on harmony, with patience; and we readily grant, that the system of harmony by M. Rameau is neither demonstrated, nor capable of demonstration. But it will not follow, that any man of invention can so easily and so quickly subvert those aptitudes and analogies on which the system is founded. Every hypothesis is admitted to possess a degree of probability proportioned to the number of phenomena for which it offers a satisfactory solution. The first experiment of M. Rameau is, that every sonorous body, together with its principal sound and its octave, gives likewise its twelfth and seventeenth major above; which being approximated as much as possible, even to the chords immediately represented by them, return to the third, fifth, and octave, or, in other words, produce perfect harmony. This is what nature, when solicited, spontaneously gives; this is what the human ear, unprepared and uncultivated, imbibes with ineffable avidity and pleasure. Could anything which claims a right to our attention, and acceptance from nature, be impressed with more genuine or more legible signatures of her sanction than this? We do not contend for the truth of M. Rameau's second experiment. Nor is it necessary we should. The first, expanded and carried into all its consequences, resolves the phenomena of harmony in a manner sufficient to establish its authenticity and influence. The difficulties for which it affords no solution are too few and too trivial either to merit the regard of an artist, or a philosopher, as M. D'Alembert in his elements has clearly shown. The facts with which M. Rousseau confronts this principle, the armies of multiplied harmonics generated in infinitum, which he draws up in formidable array against it, only show the thin partitions which sometimes may divide philosophy from whimsy. For, as bodies are infinitely divisible, according to the philosophy now established, or as, according to every philosophy, they must be indefinitely divisible, each infinitesimal of any given mass, which are only harmonics to other principal sounds, must have fundamental tones and harmonics peculiar to themselves; so that, if the reasoning of Rousseau has any force against M. Rameau's experiment, the ear must be continually distracted with a chaos of inappreciable harmonics, and melody itself must be lost in the confusion. But the truth of the matter is, that, by the wise intuition of nature, there is such a conformity established between our senses and their proper objects, as must prevent all these disagreeable\nHarmony, able effects. Rousseau and his opponent are agreed in this, that the harmonics conspire to form one predominant sound; and are not to be detected but by the nicest organs, applied with the deepest attention. It is equally obvious, that, in an artificial harmony, by a proper management of this wise precaution of nature, differences themselves may be either entirely concealed or considerably softened. So that, since by nature sonorous bodies in actual vibration are predisposed to exhibit perfect harmony; and since the human ear is, by the same wise regulation, fabricated in such a manner as to perceive it; the harmonical chaos of M. Rousseau may be left to operate on his own brain, where it will probably meet with the warmest reception it can expect to find*. Nor does it avail him to pretend, that before the harmonics can be distinguished, sonorous bodies must be impelled with a force which alters the chords, and destroys the purity of the harmony; for this position is equally false both in theory and practice. In theory, because an impulse, however forcible, must proportionally operate on all the parts of any sonorous body, so far as it extends: in practice, because the human ear actually perceives the harmony to be pure. What effects his various manoeuvres upon the organ may have, we leave to such as have leisure and curiosity enough to try the experiments; but it is apprehended, that when tried, their results will leave the system of Rameau, particularly as remodelled by D'Alembert, in its full force.\n\nOf all the whims and paradoxes maintained by this philosopher, none is more extravagant than his assertion, that every chord, except the simple unison, is displeasing to the human ear; nay, that we are only reconciled to octaves themselves by being inured to hear them from our infancy. Strange, that nature should have fixed this invariable proportion between male and female voices, whilst at the same time she inspired the hearers with such violent propensities against it as were invincible but by long and confirmed habit! The translator of D'Alembert's Elements, as given under the article Music in this Dictionary, has been at peculiar pains to investigate his earliest recollections upon this subject; and has had such opportunities, both of attending to his original perceptions, and of recognizing the fidelity of his memory, as are not common. He can remember, even from a period of early childhood, to have been pleased with the simplest kinds of artificial harmony; to have distinguished the harmonies of sonorous bodies with delight; and to have been struck with horror at the sound of such bodies as, by their structure, or by the cohesion of their parts, exhibited these harmonies false. This is the chief, if not the only cause, of the tremendous and disagreeable sensation which we feel from the sound of the Chinese gong. The same horrible cacophony is frequently, in some degree, produced by a drum unequally braced: from this sound the translator often remembers to have started and screamed, when carried through the streets of the town in which he was born in the arms of his nursey-maid; and as he is conscious, that the acoustic organs of many are as exquisite as his own, he cannot doubt but they may have had the same sensations, though perhaps they do not recollect the facts. So early and so nicely may the sensations of harmony and discord be distinguished. But after all, it seems that harmony is no more than a modern invention, and even at this late period only known to the Europeans. We should, however, be glad to know, from what oracle our philosopher learned that harmony was not known to antiquity. From what remains of their works, no proof of his position can be derived; and we have at least mentioned one probability against it in our notes to the Preliminary Discourse to the article Music, (see Note n.) But though Rousseau's mighty objections were granted, that harmony can only be endured by such ears as are habitually formed and cultivated; that the period of its prevalence has been short, and the extent of its empire limited to Europe; still his conclusion, that it is a Gothic and barbarous invention, is not fairly deducible even from these premises. Must we affirm, that epic poetry has no foundation in nature, because, during the long interval which happened from the beginning of the world to the destruction of Troy, no epic poem seems to have appeared? Or because a natural and melilious verification is less relished by an unpolished taste, than the uncouth rhymes of a common ballad, shall we infer, that the power of numbers is merely supposititious and arbitrary? On the contrary, we will venture to affirm, that though harmony cannot, as Rameau supposes, be mathematically demonstrated from the nature and vibrations of sonorous bodies; yet the idea of its constituent parts, and of their coalescence, is no less established, no less precise and definite, than any mode or property of space or quantity to be investigated by geometrical researches or algebraical calculations. It is certain, that the mimetic or imitative power of music chiefly consists in melody; but from this truth, however evident, it cannot be fairly deduced, that harmony is absolutely unsuceptible of imitation. Perhaps every musical sound, even to the most simple, and all modulations of sound, are more or less remotely connected with some sentiment or passion of the human heart. We know, that there are instinctive expressions of pain or pleasure in their various modes and degrees, which, when uttered by any sensitive, and perceived by any conscious being, excite in the mind of the percipient a feeling sympathetic with that by which they are prompted. We likewise know from experience, that all artificial sounds modulated in the same manner, have similar, though not equal, effects. We have seen that, in order to render harmony compatible with itself, the melody of each part must be congenial; and, for that reason, one kindred melody results from the whole. So far, therefore, as any composer has it in his power to render the general melody homogeneous, so far the imitation may be preserved, and even heightened: for such objects as are majestic and august, or the feelings which they excite, are more aptly expressed by a composition of kindred sounds, than by any simple tone whatever. They who suppose the mimetic powers of music to be consummated in the imitation of mere unmeaning sounds or degrees of motion, must entertain limited and unworthy ideas of its province. It is naturally a representative almost of every sentiment or affection of the soul; and, when this end is gained, the art must have reached its highest perfection, and produced its noblest effects. But these effects, however sensible among the ancients, may in us be superseded by other causes which remain yet unexplored.\nHarmony explored. Theatrical performances are likewise, by them, said to have produced the most wonderful effects; yet these we do not recognize amongst ourselves, though we have dramatic entertainments perhaps not inferior to theirs.\n\nRouleau proceeds to tell us, that among the ancients the enharmonic species of music was sometimes called harmony.\n\nDirect Harmony, is that in which the bass is fundamental, and in which the upper parts preserve among themselves, and with that fundamental bass, the natural and original order which ought to subsist in each of the chords that compose this harmony.\n\nInverted Harmony, is that in which the fundamental or generating sound is placed in some of the upper parts, and when some other sound of the chords is transferred to the bass beneath the others.\n\nHarmony of the Spheres, or Celestial Harmony, a sort of music much talked of by many of the ancient philosophers and fathers, supposed to be produced by the sweetly tuned motions of the stars and planets. This harmony they attributed to the various proportionate impressions of the heavenly globes upon one another, acting at proper intervals. It is impossible, according to them, that such prodigious large bodies, moving with so much rapidity, should be silent: on the contrary, the atmosphere, continually impelled by them, must yield a set of sounds proportionate to the impression it receives; consequently, as they do not all run the same circuit, nor with one and the same velocity, the different tones arising from the diversity of motions, directed by the hand of the Almighty, must form an admirable symphony or concert.\n\nThey therefore supposed, that the moon, as being the lowest of the planets, corresponded to mi; Mercury, to fa; Venus, to sol; the Sun, to la; Mars, to re; Jupiter, to ut; Saturn, to re; and the orb of the fixed stars, as being the highest of all, to mi, or the octave.\n\nHarmostes, or Harmosta, in antiquity, a sort of magistrates among the Spartans, whereof there were several, whose business was to look to the building of citadels, and repairing the forts and fortifications of the cities.—The word is aquosus, formed of aquosus, opto, concino, “I adapt, concert,” &c.\n\nHarmosynians, aquosus, in antiquity, were magistrates among the Spartans, who, after the death of Lycurgus, were appointed to enforce the observance of that law of the Spartan legislator which required married women to wear a veil when they appeared in the streets, whereby they were distinguished from single females, who were allowed to appear abroad with their faces uncovered.\n\nHarness, a complete armour, or the whole equipage and accoutrements of a cavalry heavily armed; as caisse, cuirass, &c. The word is formed of the French harnois; which some derive from the Greek agnus, “a lamb’s skin,” because they anciently covered themselves therewith. Du Cange observes, that the word harnesium is used in the corrupt Latin in the same sense, and that it comes from the High Dutch harnas or harnisch. Others derive it from the Italian armi; others from the Celtic harnes, “a cuirass.”\n\nUnder King Richard II. it was expressly forbidden all men to ride in harness with lancegays. Vide stat. 7. Richard II. cap. 13. In the statute 2 Hen. VI. cap. 14. Harness seems to include all kinds of furniture for offence as well as defence, both of men and horse; as swords, buckles for belts, girdles, &c.\n\nHarness is also used for the furniture put on a horse to draw in a coach or waggon, or other carriage; such as collars, leathers, traces, &c.\n\nHaro, a small town of Spain in Old Castile, on the Ebro, surrounded with walls. W. Long. 2. 23. N. Lat. 42. 40.\n\nHarou, Harou, or Harol, in the Norman customs.—Clamour de haro is a cry or formula of invoking the afflatus of justice against the violence of some offender, who upon hearing the word haro is obliged to desist, on pain of being severely punished for his outrage, and to go with the party before the judge.\n\nThe word is commonly derived of ha and roui, as being supposed an invocation of the sovereign power, to assist the weak against the strong, on occasion of Raoul first duke of Normandy, about the year 912, who rendered himself venerable to his subjects by the severity of his justice; so that they called on him even after his death when they suffered any oppression. Some derive it from Harola king of Denmark, who in the year 826 was made grand conservator of justice at Mentz. Others from the Danish aa rau, q. d. “help me?” a cry raised by the Normans in flying from a king of Denmark named Roux, who made himself duke of Normandy. The letters of the French chancery have usually this clause, Nonobstant clamur de haro, &c.\n\nThe haro had anciently such vast power, that a poor man of the city of Caen named Affelin, in virtue hereof, arrested the corpse of William the Conqueror, in the middle of the funeral procession, till such time as his son Henry had paid the value of the land in question, which was that on which the chapel was built in which he was interred.\n\nHarold, the name of two English kings. See England, No. 77, 83.\n\nHaronia, a town of Turkey, in the Arabian Irak, 45 miles north of Bagdad.\n\nHaroue, a town of France, in the department of Meurthe, 13½ miles south-west of Luneville.\n\nHarp, a musical instrument of the stringed kind, of a triangular figure, and held upright between the legs of the performer.\n\nPapias, and Du Cange after him, will have the harp to have taken its name from the Arpi, a people of Italy, who were supposed the first that invented it; and from whom, they say, it was borrowed by other nations. Menage, &c. derive the word from the Latin harpa, and that from the German herp or harp. Others bring it from the Latin carpo, because touched or thumbed with the fingers. Dr Hickes derives it from harpa or hearpa, which signify the same thing; the first in the language of the Cimbri, the second in that of the Anglo Saxons. The English priest who wrote the life of St Dunstan, and who lived with him in the tenth century, says, cap. ii. n. 12. Sancti secundum ex more ciheram fum, quam paterna lingua hearpam vocamus; which intimates the word to be Anglo-Saxon.\n\nThe harp was the favourite musical instrument of the Britons and other northern nations in the middle ages; as is evident from their laws, and from every passage\npassage in their history, in which there is the least allusion to music. By the laws of Wales, a harp was one of the three things that were necessary to constitute a gentleman, i.e., a freeman; and none could pretend to that character who had not one of these favourite instruments, or could not play upon it. By the same laws, to prevent slaves from pretending to be gentlemen, it was expressly forbidden to teach, or to permit, them to play upon the harp; and none but the king, the king's musicians, and gentlemen, were allowed to have harps in their possession. A gentleman's harp was not liable to be seized for debt; because the want of it would have degraded him from his rank, and reduced him to a slave. The harp was in no less estimation and universal use among the Saxons and Danes. Those who played upon this instrument were declared gentlemen by law; their persons were esteemed inviolable, and secured from injuries by very severe penalties; they were readily admitted into the highest company, and treated with distinguished marks of respect wherever they appeared.\n\nThere is some diversity in the structure of harps. That called the triple harp has 97 strings or chords in three rows, extending from C in the tenor cliff to double G in alt., which make five octaves: the middle row is for the semitones, and the two outside rows are perfect unisons. On the bass side, which is played with the right hand, there are 36 strings: on the treble side, 26; and in the middle row, 35 strings. There are two rows of pins or screws on the right side, serving to keep the strings tight in their holes, which are fastened at the other end to three rows of pins on the upper side. The harp, within the last 40 years, has been in some degree improved by the addition of eight strings to the union, viz., from E to double F in alt. This instrument is struck with the finger and thumb of both hands. Its music is much like that of the spinet, all its strings going from semitone to semitone; whence some call it an inverted spinet. It is capable of a much greater degree of perfection than the lute.\n\nThere are among us two sorts of this instrument, viz., the Welsh harp, being that just described; and the Irish harp. Plate CCL. No. 1. represents the harp of Brian Boromh, king of all Ireland, slain in battle with the Danes A.D. 1014, at Clontarf. His son Donagh having murdered his brother Teige, A.D. 1023, and being deposed by his nephew, retired to Rome, and carried with him the crown, harp, and other regalia of his father, which he presented to the Pope in order to obtain absolution. Adrian IV. surnamed Breakspear, alleged this circumstance as one of the principal titles he claimed to this kingdom in his bull transferring it to Henry II. These regalia were kept in the Vatican till the Pope sent the harp to Henry VIII., with the title of Defender of the Faith; but kept the crown, which was of massive gold. Henry gave the harp to the first earl of Clanricard, in whose family it remained till the beginning of the 18th century, when it came by a lady of the De Burgh family into that of Mac Mahon of Clanmah in the county of Clare, after whose death it passed into the possession of Commissioner Mac Namara of Limerick. In 1782 it was presented to the right honourable William Conyngham, who deposited it in Trinity college library. It is 32 inches high, and of extraordinary good workmanship; the sounding-board is of oak, the arms of red fally; the extremity of the uppermost arm in part is cast with silver, extremely well wrought and chiseled. It contains a large crystal set in silver, and under it was another stone now lost. The buttons or ornamental knobs at the sides of this arm are of silver. On the front arm are the arms chased in silver of the O'Brien family, the bloody hand supported by lions. On the sides of the front arm within two circles are two Irish wolf dogs cut in the wood. The holes of the sounding board where the strings entered are neatly ornamented with fleur-de-lis carved and gilt; the larger sounding-holes have been ornamented, probably with silver, as they have been the object of theft. This harp has 28 keys, and as many string-holes, consequently there were as many strings. The foot piece or rest is broken off, and the parts round which it was joined are very rotten. The whole bears evidence of an expert artifit.\n\nKing David is usually painted with a harp in his hands; but we have no testimony in all antiquity that the Hebrew harp called cimbor, was anything like ours. On a Hebrew medal of Simon Macabaeus we see two sorts of musical instruments; but they are both of them very different from our harp, and only consist of three or four strings. All authors agree, that our harp is very different from the lyra, cithara, or barbiton, of the Romans. Fortunatus, lib. vii. carm. 8. witnesseth, that it was an instrument of the barbarians:\n\nRomanusque lyra, plaudat tibi barbarus harpa,\nGrecus Achilliach, erotta Britanna canat.\n\nOf ancient harps, two are represented on the same plate.—No. 2. is a trigonum or triangular harp. It is taken from an ancient painting in the museum of the king of Naples, in which it is placed on the shoulder of a little dancing Cupid, who supports the instrument with his left hand and plays upon it with his right. The trigonum is mentioned by Athenæus, lib. iv. and by Julius Pollux, lib. iv. cap. 9. According to Athenæus, Sophocles calls it a Phrygian instrument; and one of his dipothophils tells us, that a certain musician, named Alexander Alexandrinus, was such an admirable performer upon it, and had given such proofs of his abilities at Rome, that he made the inhabitants μακρογνώμονες, \"mutually mad.\" No. 3. and 4. are varieties of the same instrument. No. 5. is the Theban harp, according to a drawing made from an ancient painting in one of the sepulchral grottoes of the first kings of Thebes, and communicated by Mr Bruce to Dr Burney*. The performer is clad in a habit made like a skirt, such as they wear in Abyssinia, and the men in Nubia. It reaches down to his ankles; his feet are without sandals, and bare; his neck and arms are also bare; his loose white sleeves are gathered above his elbows; and his head is close shaved. His left hand seems employed in the upper part of the instrument among the notes in alto, as if in an arpeggio; while, swooping forwards, he seems with his right hand to be beginning with the lowest string, and promising to ascend with the most rapid execution: this action, so obviously rendered by an indifferent artist, shows that it was a common one in his time; or, in other words, that great hands were then frequent, and consequently that music was well understood and diligently followed.\n\nOn this instrument Dr Burney makes the following observations:\nobservations: \"The number of strings, the size and form of this instrument, and the elegance of its ornaments, awaken reflections, which to indulge would lead us too far from our purpose, and indeed out of our depth. The mind is wholly lost in the immeasurable antiquity of the painting in which it is represented. Indeed the time when it was executed is so remote, as to encourage a belief, that arts, after having been brought to great perfection, were again lost and again invented long after this period.—With respect to the number of strings upon this harp, if conjectures may be allowed concerning the method of tuning them, two might be offered to the reader's choice. The first idea that presented itself at the sight of 13 strings was, that they would furnish all the semitones to be found in modern instruments within the compass of an octave, as from C to c, D to d, or E to e. The second idea is more Grecian, and conformable to antiquity; which is, that if the longest string represented proflamianomenor, or D, the remaining 12 strings would supply all the tones, semitones and quarter-tones, of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic genera of the ancients, within the compass of an octave: but for my part, I would rather incline to the first arrangement, as it is more natural, and more conformable to the structure of our organs, than the second. For with respect to the genera of the Greeks, though no historic testimony can be produced concerning the invention of the diatonic and chromatic, yet ancient writers are unanimous in ascribing to Olympus the Phrygian the first use of the enharmonic: and though in the beginning the melody of this genus was so simple and natural as to resemble the wild notes and rude effays of a people not quite emerged from barbarism; yet in after-times it became overcharged with finical fopperies and fanciful beauties, arising from such minute divisions of the scale as had no other merit than the great difficulty of forming them. It seems a matter of great wonder, with such a model before their eyes as the Theban harp, that the form and manner of using such an instrument should not have been perpetuated by posterity; but that, many ages after, another of an inferior kind, with fewer strings, should take place of it. Yet if we consider how little we are acquainted with the use and even construction of the instruments which afforded the greatest delight to the Greeks and Romans, or even with others in common use in a neighbouring part of Europe, only a few centuries ago, our wonder will cease; especially if we reflect upon the ignorance and barbarism into which it is possible for an ingenious people to be plunged by the tyranny and devastation of a powerful and cruel invader.\"\n\nBell-Harp, a musical instrument of the string kind, thus called from the common players on it swinging it about, as a bell on its basis.\n\nIt is about three feet long; its strings, which are of no determinate number, are of brass or steel wire, fixed at one end, and stretched across the sound board by screws fixed at the other. It takes in four octaves, according to the number of the strings, which are struck only with the thumbs, the right hand playing the treble and the left hand the bass; and in order to draw the sound the clearer, the thumbs are armed with a little wire pin. This may perhaps be the lyra or cythara of the ancients; but we find no mention made of it under the name it now bears, which must be allowed to be modern.\n\nHarp of Aeolus. See Acoustics, p. 149.\n\nHarpagines, in antiquity, were hooks of iron, hanging on the top of a pole, which, being secured with chains to the masts of ships, and then let down with great velocity into the enemy's vessels, caught them up into the air. By way of defense against these machines, they covered their ships with hides, which broke and blunted the force of the iron. The harpagines, by the Greeks called ἀγραφίαι, owe their invention to Anacharsis the Scythian philosopher.\n\nHarpadius. See Harpagius.\n\nHarpalus, a Greek astronomer, who flourished about 480 B.C., corrected the cycle of eight years invented by Cleostratus; and proposed a new one of nine years, in which he imagined the sun and moon returned to the same point. But Harpalus's cycle was afterwards altered by Meton, who added ten full years to it. See Chronology, No. 27.\n\nHarpies (ἀρπυίαι, Harpyiae), in antiquity, a rapacious impure sort of monsters of the bird kind, mentioned among the poets. They are represented *Virg. En. with wings, ears like bears, bodies like vultures, faces like women, and feet and hands hooked like the talons of birds of prey.\n\nThe ancients looked on the harpies as a sort of genii or demons. Some make them the daughters of Tellus and Oceanus, the earth and ocean; whence, says Servius, it is, that they inhabit an island, half on land and half in water. Valerius Flaccus makes them the daughters of Typhon.\n\nThere were three harpies, Aello, Ocypete, and Celaeno, which last Homer calls Podarge. Hesiod, in his Theogony, ver. 267, only reckons two, Aello and Ocypete, and makes them the daughters of Thaumas and Electra, affirming that they had wings, and went with the rapidity of the wind. Zephyrus begat of them Ballus and Xanthus, Achilles' horses. Pherecydes relates, that the Borcades expelled them from the Aegean and Sicilian seas, and pursued them as far as the islands which he calls Ploce and Homer Calypso; and which have since been called the Strophades.\n\nVoplius, De Idol. lib. iii. cap. 99, p. 63, thinks, that what the ancients have related of the harpies, agrees to no other birds so well as the bats found in the territories of Darien in South America. These animals kill not only birds, but dogs and cats, and prove very troublesome to men by their peckings. But the ancients, as the same Voplius observes, knew nothing of these birds. By the harpies, therefore, he thinks, they could mean nothing else but the winds; and that it was on this account they were made daughters of Electra, the daughter of Oceanus. Such is the opinion of the scholiasts of Apollonius, Hesiod, and Euclides. Their names, Aello, Ocypete, Celaeno, are supposed to suggest a farther argument of this.\n\nMr Bryant supposes that the harpies were a college of priests in Bithynia, who on account of their repeated acts of violence and cruelty, were driven out of the country: their temple was called Arpi, and the environs Arpia, whence the Grecians formed Αρπυιαι; and he observes farther, that Harpyia, Αρπυιαι, was certainly of old the name of a place.\n\nHarping.\nHARPING IRON. See Harpoon.\n\nHARPINGS, the fore-parts of the wales which encompass the bow of a ship, and are fastened to the stem, being thicker than the after part of the wales, in order to reinforce the ship in this place, where she suffers the greatest shock of resistance in plunging into the sea, or dividing it, under a great pressure of sail.\n\nHARPOCRATES, in Mythology, the son of Isis and Osiris. This is an Egyptian deity, whose distinguishing attribute is, that he is represented with his fingers applied to his mouth, denoting that he is the god of silence. The statue of this idol was fixed in the entrance of most of the Egyptian temples, and he was commonly exhibited under the figure of a young man naked, crowned with an Egyptian mitre, holding in one hand a cornucopia, and in the other the flower of lotus, and sometimes bearing a quiver.\n\nHARPOCRATION, Valerius, a celebrated ancient rhetorician of Alexandria, who has left us an excellent Lexicon upon the ten orators of Greece. Aldus first published this lexicon in the Greek at Venice in 1603. Many learned men have laboured upon it; but the best edition was given by James Gronovius at Leyden in 1696.\n\nHARPOON or Harping-iron, a spear or javelin used to strike the whales in the Greenland fishery.\n\nThe harpoon, which is sometimes called the harping-iron, is furnished with a long staff, having at one end a broad and flat triangular head, sharpened at both edges, so as to penetrate the whale with facility: to the head of this weapon is fastened a long cord, called the whale-line, which lies carefully coiled in the boat, in such a manner as to run out without being interrupted or entangled. See Whale-Fishery, Cetology Index.\n\nGun-Harpoon, a kind of fire-arm for discharging harpoons at whales, and thereby killing them more easily and expeditiously than formerly when the harpoons were thrown by the hand. Though this method was projected a good many years ago, it has but lately come into use; and premiums have been annually offered by the society for encouraging arts, &c., to the persons who first struck a fish in this manner. In the Transactions of that Society for 1786, we have an account of the first fish struck in this manner in 1784. The gun was of the blunderbuss construction, loaded with four common tobacco pipes full of glazed powder; the fish was shot at the distance of ten fathoms, the harpoon going into her back up to the ring; and she was killed in about an hour. In 1785 three whales were killed in this manner; four in 1786, and three in 1787. Since that time the gun-harpoon has come more into use, and will probably soon supersede the other method entirely. In the Transactions of the Society for 1789, we have accounts of a number of whales killed in this manner. The instrument appears to be extremely useful in calm still weather, as the whale, though a timorous creature, will frequently allow a boat to approach it to the distance of 20, 15, or even 10 fathoms, all of which distances are within reach of the gun-harpoon, though not within the reach of that thrown by the hand. The greatest inconvenience was in case of rain or snow, by which the lock was apt to get wet. To remedy this, a case of leather was made to fit round the gun and over the lock, lined with tin, and big enough to fire the gun when it was on. The fish struck with an harpoon discharged in this manner are soon killed by reason of its penetrating their bodies to a great depth, not less than five or six feet, which no man's strength would be able to accomplish. In the volume just quoted, we have an account of one which was shot through the tail. The harpoon broke in the flit, but five fathoms of line went through the tail. The fish was killed in eight hours, which is perhaps the only instance of a fish struck in that part being caught. In another, the harpoon carried six feet of line into its body; the creature died in ten minutes. Others were killed in 15 minutes or half an hour, and one had a rib broken by the violence of the stroke. In the Transactions of the Society for 1790, there are other accounts similar to the foregoing, and all agreeing as to the great usefulness of the instrument both for striking the fish at a considerable distance, and for killing them in a very short time.\n\nHarpichord, the most harmonious of all the musical instruments of the string kind. It is played on after the manner of the organ, and is furnished with a set, and sometimes with two sets of keys; the touching or striking of these keys moves a kind of little jacks, which also move a double row of chords or strings, of brass or iron, stretched over four bridges on the table of the instrument.\n\nHarquebus, a piece of fire-arms, of the length of a musket, usually cocked with a wheel. It carried a ball that weighed one ounce seven-eighths.\n\nThere was also a larger fort, called the great harquebus, used for the defence of strong places, which carried a ball of about three ounces and a half; but they are now but little used, except in some old castles, and by the French in some of their garrisons.\n\nHARRIER, a kind of hound, endowed with an admirable gift of scenting, and very bold in the pursuit of his game. See Canis.\n\nHARRINGTON, Sir John, an ingenious English poet, was the son of John Harrington, Esq.; who was committed to the Tower by Queen Mary for holding a correspondence with her sister Elizabeth; who, when she came to the crown, stood godmother to this son. Before he was 30, he published a translation of Ariosto's Orlando Furioso, a work by which he was principally known; for though he afterwards published some epigrams, his talent did not seem to have lain that way. He was created knight of the bath by James I.; and presented a MS. to Prince Henry, levelled chiefly at the married bishops. He is supposed to have died about the latter end of James's reign.\n\nHarrington, James, a most eminent English writer in the 17th century, bred at Oxford, travelled into Holland, France, Denmark, and Germany, and learned the languages of those countries. Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of the privy-chamber extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great fidelity, and made use of his influence with his friends in parliament to procure matters to be accommodated with all parties. The king loved his company except when the conversation happened to turn upon commonwealths. He found means to see the king at St James's; and attended him on the scaffold,\nHarriot, scaffold, where, or a little before, he received a token of his majesty's affection. After the death of King Charles, he wrote his Oceana; a kind of political romance, in imitation of Plato's Commonwealth, which he dedicated to Oliver Cromwell. It is said, that when Oliver perused it, he declared, that \"the gentleman had wrote very well, but must not think to cheat him out of his power and authority; for that what he had won by the sword, he would not suffer himself to be scribbled out of.\" This work was attacked by several writers, against whom he defended it. Beside his writings to promote republican principles, he instituted likewise a nightly meeting of several ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard, Westminster; which club was called the Rota, and continued till the secluded members of parliament were restored by General Monk. In 1661, he was committed to the Tower for treasonable designs and practices; and Chancellor Hyde, at a conference with the lords and commons, charged him with being concerned in a plot. But a committee of lords and commons could make nothing of that plot. He was conveyed to St Nicholas's island, and from thence to Plymouth, where he fell into an uncommon disorder of the imagination. Having obtained his liberty by means of the earl of Bath, he was carried to London, and died in 1677. He published, besides the above works, several others, which were first collected by Toland, in one volume folio, in 1700: but a more complete edition was published in 1737, by the reverend Dr Birch.\n\nHARRIOT, THOMAS, a celebrated algebraist, was born at Oxford in 1562, where he was also educated. In 1579 he completed his bachelor's degree; and, being already distinguished for his mathematical learning, was soon after recommended to Sir Walter Raleigh, as a proper person to instruct him in that science. He was accordingly received into the family of that gentleman; who, in 1585, sent him with the colony, under Sir Richard Granville, to Virginia; of which country, having remained there about a year, he afterwards published a topographical description. About the year 1588, Mr Harriot was introduced by his patron Sir Walter Raleigh, to Henry Percy earl of Northumberland, who allowed him a pension of £200. per annum. He spent many years of his life in Sion college; where he died in July 1621, of a cancer in his lip, and was buried in the church of St Christopher, where a handsome monument was erected to his memory. Anthony Wood tells us, he was a deit, and that the divines looked upon his death as a judgment. Be his religious opinions what they might, he was doubtless one of the first mathematicians of the age in which he lived, and will always be remembered as the inventor of the present improved method of algebraical calculation. His improvements in algebra were adopted by Des Cartes, and for a considerable time imposed upon the French nation as his own invention; but the theft was at last detected, and exposed by Dr Wallis, in his History of Algebra, where the reader will find our author's invention accurately specified. His works are, 1. A brief and true report of the new-found land of Virginia; of the commodities there found, and to be raised, &c. 2. Artis analyticæ praxis ad equationes algebraicas nova expe-\n\ndita, et generali methodo resolvendas, &c. 3. Ephemeris chymometrica. Manuscript, in the library of Sion college. He is said to have left several other manuscripts, which are probably lost.\n\nDr Zach, who fully established the truth of Des Cartes having pilfered from the Artis analyticæ praxis, &c. of Harriot, and given it to the world as his own, speaks thus of our celebrated mathematician and algebraist: \"It is remarkable, that the fame and the honour of this truly great man, were constantly attacked by the French mathematicians, who could not endure that Harriot should in any way diminish the fame of their Vieta and Des Cartes, especially the latter, who was openly accused of plagiarism from our author.\"\n\n\"Des Cartes published his Geometry five years after Harriot's work appeared, viz. in the year 1637. Sir Charles Cavendish, then ambassador at the French court, observed to the famous geometrician Roverval, that these improvements in analysis had been already made these five years in England; and shewed him afterwards Harriot's Artis Analyticae Praxis; which, as Roverval was looking over, at every page he cried out, yes! yes! he has seen it! Des Cartes had also been in England before Harriot's death, and had heard of his new improvements and inventions in analysis.\n\n\"I found likewise (says Dr Zach) among the papers of Harriot a large set of observations on the satellites of Jupiter, with drawings of them, their positions, and calculations of their revolutions and periods. His first observation of these discovered satellites, I find to be of January 16, 1610, and they go till February 26, 1612. Galileo pretends to have discovered them January 7, 1610; so that it is not improbable that Harriot was likewise the first discoverer of these attendants of Jupiter.\"\n\nHARRIS, JAMES, Esq., an English gentleman of very uncommon parts and learning, was the son of James Harris, Esq., by a sister of Lord Shaftesbury author of The Characteristics. He was born in the Clole at Salisbury 1709; and educated at the grammar-school there. In 1726, he was removed to Wadham-college in Oxford, but took no degree. He cultivated letters, however, most attentively; and also music, in the theory and practice of which he is said to have had few equals. He was member for Christchurch, Hants, which he represented in several successive parliaments. In 1763, he was appointed one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, and soon after removed to the board of treasury. In 1774 he was made secretary and comptroller to the queen, which post he held until his death. He died Dec. 21, 1780, in his 72nd year, after a long illness, which he bore with calmness and resignation.—He is the author of some valuable works. 1. Three Treatises, concerning Art; Music, Painting, and Poetry; and Happiness, 1745, 8vo. 2. Hermes; or, A Philosophical Enquiry concerning Universal Grammar. 3. Philosophical Arrangements. 4. Philological Inquiries, 1782, 2 vols 8vo, finished just before his death, and published since. These Inquiries show much ingenuity and learning; but being the amusement of his old age rather than an exertion of genius, they have not the philosophic tone of his former productions.\n\nHARRIS, one of the Hebrides or Western Islands.\nof Scotland. It is about 25 miles in length, and from 6 to 8 in breadth. Upon the east side it is mostly rock; but on the west there are some tolerable farms, and the number of people amounts to 2500. It has Lewis on the north, and North Uist on the south, from which it is separated by a channel of four miles in width, called the Sound of Harris. This channel is navigable for vessels of burden, but it requires a skilful pilot. It is the only passage between the Butt of the Lewis and Bara for vessels of burden passing to and from the west side of the Long Island. The sound is generally encumbered with rocks and islands, some of which are considerable, as Bernera, Pabbay, Emay, Killegay. These, with Scalpay, Taransay, and Scarp, compose the inhabited islands on the coast of Harris. Some of them produce good crops of grain, and all of them good pasture. Harris and its islands sell from 400 to 500 tons of kelp annually; it abounds on the east side in excellent lochs or bays, and its shores on both sides form one continued fishery. The fish on this coast, and along the whole shores of the Long Island, are more numerous, and of larger dimensions, than those on the opposite continent; on which account, two royal fishing stations were begun in the reign of Charles I., one in Loch Maddie, and the other in the Sound of Harris.\n\nHARRISON, WILLIAM, a writer much esteemed and patronized by the literati of his time, was fellow of New-college, Oxford, and had no other income than £30 a-year as tutor to one of the duke of Queensberry's sons. In this employment he fortunately attracted the favour of Dr Swift, whose solicitations with Mr St John obtained for him the reputable employment of secretary to Lord Raby, ambassador at the Hague, and afterwards earl of Strafford. A letter of his whilst at Utrecht, dated Dec. 16, 1712, is printed in the Dean's works. Mr Harrison, who did not long enjoy his rising fortune, was dispatched to London with the Barrier treaty; and died Feb. 14, 1712-13. See the Journal to Stella, of that and the following day; where Dr Swift laments his loss with the most unaffected sincerity. Mr Tickell has mentioned him with respect in his Prospect of Peace; in English Poets, vol. xxvi. p. 113; and Dr Young in the beautiful close of an Epistle to Lord Lansdowne; vol. iii. p. 185, most pathetically bewails his loss. Dr Birch, who has given a curious note on Mr Harrison's Letter to Swift, has confounded him with Thomas Harrison, M.A. of Queen's college. In Nichols's Select Collection are some pleasing specimens of his poetry; which, with Woodstock-Park in Doddley's Collection, and an Ode to the duke of Marlborough, 1707, in Duncombe's Horace, are all the poetical writings that are known of this excellent young man; who figured both as an humorist and a politician in the fifth volume of the Tatler, of which (under the patronage of Bolingbroke, Henley, and Swift) he was professedly the editor. See the Supplement to Swift.—There was another William Harrison, author of The Pilgrim, or the happy Convert, a Pastoral Tragedy, 1799.\n\nHARRISON, JOHN, a most accurate mechanic, the celebrated inventor of the famous time-keeper for ascertaining the longitude at sea, and also of the compound, or, as it is commonly called, the gridiron pendulum; was born at Foulby, in the parish of Wrangleby, near Pontefract in Yorkshire, in 1693. The vigour of his natural abilities, if not even strengthened by the want of education, which confined his attention to few objects, at least amply compensated the deficiencies of it; as fully appeared from the astonishing progress he made in that branch of mechanics to which he devoted himself. His father was a carpenter, in which profession the son assisted; occasionally also, according to the miscellaneous practice of country artists, surveying land, and repairing clocks and watches. He was, from his early childhood, attached to any machinery moving by wheels, as appeared while he lay sick of the small-pox about the sixth year of his age, when he had a watch placed open upon his pillow to amuse himself by contemplating the movement. In 1700, he removed with his father to Barrow in Lincolnshire; where though his opportunities of acquiring knowledge were very few, he eagerly improved every incident from which he might collect information; frequently employing all or great part of his nights in writing or drawing; and he always acknowledged his obligations to a clergyman who came every Sunday to officiate in the neighbourhood, who lent him a MS. copy of Professor Saunderson's Lectures; which he carefully and neatly transcribed, with all the diagrams. His native genius exerted itself superior to these solitary disadvantages; for in the year 1726, he had constructed two clocks, mostly of wood, in which he applied the escapement and compound pendulum of his own invention; these surpassed everything then made, scarcely erring a second in a month. In 1728, he came up to London with the drawings of a machine for determining the longitude at sea, in expectation of being enabled to execute one by the board of longitude. Upon application to Dr Halley, he referred him to Mr George Graham; who, discovering he had uncommon merit, advised him to make his machine before he applied to the board of longitude. He returned home to perform this task; and in 1735 came to London again with his first machine; with which he was sent to Lisbon the next year for a trial of its properties. In this short voyage, he corrected the dead reckoning about a degree and a half; a success that proved the means of his receiving both public and private encouragement. About the year 1739, he completed his second machine, of a construction much more simple than the former, and which answered much better; this, though not sent to sea, recommended Mr Harrison yet stronger to the patronage of his private friends and of the public. His third machine, which he produced in 1749, was still less complicated than the second, and superior in accuracy, as erring only three or four seconds in a week. This he conceived to be the ne plus ultra of his attempts; but in an endeavour to improve pocket-watches, he found the principles he applied to surpass his expectations so much, as to encourage him to make his fourth time-keeper, which is in the form of a pocket watch, about six inches diameter. With this time-keeper his son made two voyages, the one to Jamaica, and the other to Barbadoes: in both which experiments it corrected the longitude within the nearest limits required by the act of the 12th of Queen Anne; and the inventor therefore, at different times, though not without infinite trouble, received\nHarrifon, the proposed reward of 20,000l. These four machines were given up to the board of longitude. The three former were not of any use, as all the advantages gained by making them were comprehended in the last; they were worthy, however, of being carefully preserved as mechanical curiosities, in which might be traced the gradations of ingenuity executed with the most delicate workmanship; whereas they now lie totally neglected in the royal observatory at Greenwich. The fourth machine, emphatically distinguished by the name of the time-keeper, has been copied by the ingenious Mr Kendal; and that duplicate, during a three years circumnavigation of the globe in the southern hemisphere by Captain Cook, answered as well as the original. The latter part of Mr Harrifon's life was employed in making a fifth improved time-keeper on the same principles with the preceding one; which, at the end of a ten weeks trial, in 1772, at the king's private observatory at Richmond, erred only 4½ seconds. Within a few years of his death, his constitution visibly declined; and he had frequent fits of the gout, a disorder that never attacked him before his 77th year; he died at his house in Red-Lion square, in 1776, aged 83. The recluse manner of his life in the unremitting pursuit of his favourite object, was by no means calculated to qualify him as a man of the world; and the many discouragements he encountered in soliciting the legal reward of his labours, still less disposed him to accommodate himself to the humours of mankind. In conversing on his profession, he was clear, distinct, and modest; yet, like many other mere mechanics, found a difficulty in delivering his meaning by writing; in which he adhered to a peculiar and uncoast phraseology. This was but too evident in his Description concerning such mechanism as will afford a nice or true mensuration of time, &c. 8vo. 1775; which his well-known mechanical talents will induce the public to account for from his unacquaintance with letters, from his advanced age, and attendant mental infirmities, among which may be reckoned his obstinate refusal to accept of any assistance whatever in this publication. This small work includes also an account of his new musical scale, or mechanical division of the octave, according to the proportion which the radius and diameter of a circle have respectively to the circumference. He had in his youth been the leader of a distinguished band of church-fingers; had a very delicate ear for music; and his experiments on sound, with a most curious monochord of his own improvement, are reported to have been not less accurate than those he was engaged in for the mensuration of time.\n\nHARROGATE, a village in the west riding of Yorkshire, in the parish of Knaresborough, remarkable for its medicinal springs. There are three in number, all different in their qualities, notwithstanding their contiguity. 1. The Tewet water or Sweet Spa, a vitriolic spring of a sort of milky taste used in gravelly cases, was discovered by Mr Slingby in 1638. 2. The flinting or sulphur spring, useful in dropsical, febrile, and gouty cases, rises in the town, and is received in four basins under four different buildings; at one it is drunk, at the others used for hot or cold baths. It is perfectly clear; but the taste and smell a composition of rotten eggs, sea-water, and sulphur, and extremely\n\nBathing is the most general method of using it. Harrow-on-the-Hill is the strongest sulphur water in Great Britain; and from the superior strength of the impregnating sulphur, it does not lose the sulphureous smell even when exposed to a scalding and almost boiling heat; and in distilling it, when three pints had been taken off from a gallon of it, the last was as strong as the first, and stunk intolerably. It is difficult and attenuating; and a warm bath of it is of great benefit in pains and aches, strains and lameness, dissolving hard swellings, curing old ulcers and scrophulous complaints, and is a powerful cleanser of the stomach and bowels.\n\n3. St Mungo's well is so called from Kentigern a Scotch saint, much honoured hereabouts, whom his tutor Servanus bishop of Orkney, out of affection for him, called Mongol, which in the Norfich or Norway language signifies a dear friend.—The Harrogate season is from May to Michaelmas; and the company assemble and lodge in five or six large houses or inns on the heath, a mile from the village, each house having a long room and an ordinary: the best company used to lodge at Knaresborough, which is three miles off.\n\nHARROW-ON-THE-HILL, a town of Middlesex, so called from its situation on the highest hill in the county, is 10 miles north-west of London. This parish is noted for a free school, founded in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. A silver arrow is shot for here once a year, viz. August 4, by a select number of the scholars, who are drilled for the purpose in the habit of archers.\n\nHarrow, an instrument in Agriculture. See Agriculture, No. 158.\n\nHART, a stag, or male-deer, in the fifth year. See Cervus, Mammalia Index.\n\nHart-Beef, or Quanga. See Capra, Mammalia Index.\n\nHart's-Horns, the horns of the common male deer.—The scrapings or raspings of the horn of this animal are medicinal, and used in decoctions, tisanes, &c.\n\nHartshorn jelly is nutritive and strengthening, and is sometimes given in diarrhoeas; but a decoction of burnt hartshorn in water is more frequently used for this purpose, and is called hartshorn drink.\n\nThe coal of hartshorn, by being calcined with a long continued and strong fire, is changed into a very white earth, called hartshorn calcined to whiteness: This earth is employed in medicine as an absorbent, and administered in dysenteries and labour pains, which are supposed to be caused by acid and ill-digested matters. This earth levigated is the basis of Sydenham's white decoction, which is commonly prescribed in these diseases.\n\nThe salt of hartshorn is a great sudorific, and given in fevers with success; and hartshorn also yields, by distillation, a very penetrative volatile spirit.\n\nHARTFORD, the capital of the county of the same name, signifying, as is commonly thought, the \"ford of harts,\" stands on the river Lea, 21 miles from London; and is of considerable antiquity. Here the East-Saxon kings often kept their court; and here, in 673, was held a synod. King Alfred built a castle here, by which the Danish vellots were destroyed, that came up from the Thames by its river as far as Ware, where the Danes had erected a fort, from which they made\nHarford, made frequent forays to plunder and destroy the country. The present castle consists of a gate-house or lodge of brick, and a range of brick buildings, which seem of the time of James or Charles I. and also of a very ancient wall of rubble stone, with angular towers, supposed to have been standing ever since its first foundation. The manor of this town was all along the king's, of whom both the town and castle were formerly held in capite. The barons took the latter from King John, but Henry III. recovered it. Edward III. gave the town a charter for markets on Thursday and Saturday, and in his grant of it to John of Gaunt it is called The Honour of Hartford. It sent members to parliament in the reign of Edward I., but after the 7th of Henry V. on the petition of the bailiff and burgesses to be exempted by reason of their poverty, that privilege was discontinued till the 22d of James I. Henry VI. who kept his Easter here in 1429, ordained by his charter, confirming their market, that no other should be kept on the same days, within seven miles, on pain of having the goods seized by the bailiffs of Hartford. This manor being then part of Queen Margaret's jointure, the courts were held in her name, and she appointed a horse fair to be kept in what part of the town the bailiff and constables thought fit. The standard of weights and measures was fixed here in the reign of Henry VII.; and Mary I. made this a corporation by the name of bailiffs and burgesses, of whom the latter were 16 by her charter. In the 25th and 35th of Elizabeth, Michaelmas-term was kept here, by reason of the plague at both times in London; and that queen, who sometimes resided in its castle, and declared the borough as parcel of her duchy of Lancaster, granted it a new charter, by the style of a bailiff, 11 capital burgesses, and 16 assistants, with a market on Saturday. James I. granted it a new charter, with the style of mayor, burgesses, and commonalty, to have 10 capital burgesses and 16 assistants, the mayor to be chosen out of the former by both of them; and a fair was then appointed here on May 12. Here was once a monastery, founded by a nephew of William the Conqueror; and here were formerly five churches which are now reduced to two. In St Andrew's there is a seat not only for the mayor and aldermen, but another for the governors of Chril church hospital in London, who have erected a house in this town on account of its healthy air and dry situation, to receive such children as wanted either health or room in that hospital; and they have built a gallery in the church, wherein 200 of their children may be accommodated. The town is now governed by a mayor, high-steward, who is generally a nobleman, a recorder, 9 aldermen, a town-clerk, chamberlain, 10 capital burgesses, and 16 assistants, and has 2 sergeants-at-mace. The chief commodities of its market are wheat, malt, and wool; and it is said to send 3000 quarters of malt to London weekly by the river Lea. Besides the abovementioned, here are two fairs on July 5. and November 8. and two others for cattle, viz. the Saturday fortnight before Easter, and its Midsummer fair is chiefly for horses. Here is a handsome free grammar-school, besides 3 charity schools; but the splendour of the place is much diminished since the north road from London was turned through Ware. The county gaol, however, is still kept in the town, and the gaol-delivery in the castle. It gives the title of Hartfords-earl to the noble family of Seymour-Conway.\n\nHARTFORDSHIRE, a county of England, deriving its name from Hartford the capital; and that from the harts with which it anciently abounded, being then overrun with woods. It is bounded on the east by Essex, on the west by Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, on the south by Middlesex, and on the north by Cambridgeshire. This county is much indented by those that surround it: the longest part is about 35 miles, and the breadth about 27; and the circumference is 190, containing about 451,000 acres. It is divided into eight hundreds, which contain 19 market towns, 54 vicarages, 120 parishes, and near 950 villages, with about 16,500 houses, and 95,000 inhabitants; and sends six members to parliament, two knights for the shire, with two burgesses for St Albans, and as many for Hartford. Before the reign of Queen Elizabeth, one sheriff served both for this shire and Essex; but in the ninth year of her reign, it had one allotted for itself. With regard to ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it belongs partly to the diocese of Lincoln, and partly to that of London. Though the soil in general, especially in the Chiltern and southern parts, is but very indifferent, and much inferior to that of the neighbouring counties; yet the air is so much superior, that lands in this shire generally sell at three or four years purchase more than in many others on that account. But it must be owned, that the soil of Hartfordshire has been much improved of late, by draining, sowing grass seeds, and other methods. There are few or no manufactures in the county; but its markets are much frequented, in consequence of its being near London, for malt and all sorts of grain, which, with the many thoroughfares through it, make ample amends.\n\nHARTLAND, a town in Devonshire, near the Bristol channel, with a market on Saturdays, much frequented by the people of Cornwall, who come hither in boats. It gives its name to a point, called Hartland Point, at the entrance of Bristol channel W. Long. 4. 45. N. Lat. 51. 9.\n\nHARTLEPOOL, a sea-port town in the county of Durham. It is commodiously seated on a promontory, and is almost encompassed by the sea. It is an ancient corporation, governed by a mayor and aldermen, with other subordinate officers. It is at present a pretty large, but poor place. It depends chiefly on the fishing trade; and its harbour is much frequented by colliers passing to and from Newcastle. W. Long. 0. 55. N. Lat. 54. 40.\n\nHARTLEY, a town of Northumberland, on the coast, situated north-west of Tynemouth, where Lord Delaval has constructed a pretty haven, whence coals are shipped for London. Here are large salt works and copperas works, and likewise considerable glass works; and there is here a canal cut through a solid rock to the harbour, 52 feet deep, 30 broad, and 900 long. These works are the sole property of Lord Delaval, and yield a revenue of above 20,000l. per annum.\n\nHartley, David, M. A. born at Ilkleyworth, where his father was curate, received his academical education at Jesus college, Cambridge, of which he was a fellow. He first began to practise physic at Newark, in Nottinghamshire; from whence he remo-\nHartogia wed to St Edmund's Bury, in Suffolk. After this, he settled for some time in London; and lastly went to live at Bath, where he died in 1757, aged 53, leaving two sons and a daughter. He published \"A view of the present evidence for and against Mrs Stephen's* medicines as a solvent for the stone, containing 155 cases, with some experiments and observations,\" London 1739. He is said to have also written against Dr Warren, of St Edmund's Bury, in defense of inoculation; and some letters of his are to be met with in the Philosophical Transactions. The doctor was certainly a man of learning, and reputed a good physician; but too fond of nostrums. But his most considerable literary production is a work entitled, \"Observations on man, his frame, his duty, and his expectations, in two parts;\" London, 1749, 2 vols. 8vo. The first part contains observations on the frame of the human body and mind, and on their mutual connections and influences. The second part contains observations on the duty and expectations of mankind.\n\n**HARTOGIA**, a genus of plants belonging to the monocotyledon class, and in the natural method ranking under the 48th order, *Aggregate*. See Botany Index.\n\n**HARUSPICES**, pretenders to divination by certain signs or omens among the Romans.—The Roman haruspices were at first all taken from Heturia, where their art had most credit. Afterwards young Romans were sent into Heturia, in order to be brought up in the science. It consisted in foretelling future events by attending to various circumstances of the victims. First, it was an ill omen when the victim would not come to the altar without dragging, when it broke its rope, fled away, avoided the stroke, struggled much after it, made a great bellowing, was long dying, or bled but little. Secondly, prelages were drawn from inspecting the noble parts of the victim when opened; as the heart, lungs, spleen, and especially the liver. If all these were found, if the top of the liver was large and well-made, and if its fibres were strong, it prefigured well for the affair in question. Thirdly, Knowledge was also drawn by the haruspices from the manner in which the fire consumed the victim. If the flame brightened immediately, was pure and clear, rose up in a pyramid without noise, and did not go out till the victim was consumed, these were happy signs. Fourthly, The smoke also was considered, whether it whirled about in curls, or spread itself to the right or the left, or gave a smell different from the common one of broiled meat. Fifthly, It was a lucky omen if the incense they burned melted all at once, and gave a most agreeable smell.\n\n**HARUSPICY.** See Haruspices and Divination.\n\n**HARUTSCH**, a mountainous region in the interior of Africa, which Mr Horneman calls the most remarkable region which came under his observation during his journey. It presents such a rugged, broken and terrific scene, as naturally leads to the supposition, that its surface has been, at some remote period, convulsed by volcanic eruptions. The face of the whole country exhibits continued ranges of hills, some not more than 12 feet above the plain, and others extremely lofty. Contiguous to this region which is called Harutsch-el-afnat, or Black Harutsch, lies the White Harutsch or Harutsch-el-abat. This latter country is a vast plain which spreads to the mountains rising towards Fezzan, and is interspersed with isolated mountains.\n\nMany of the hills contain petrifications, and the matter of which they are composed is friable limestone, in which the petrifications are very loosely imbedded, and may be taken out with ease. In these Mr Horneman found, among other marine productions, the heads of fishes so large, that one of them would have been a sufficient burden for an ordinary man. Vast numbers of shells are likewise found in the adjacent valleys, which have the appearance of being glazed, and have a vitreous fracture. It is not the abode of man, but the Arabian caravans frequently pass through it. The extent of this region is said to be seven days journey from north to south, and five days from east to west. It lies between 15° and 20° E. Long. and between 28° and 30° N. Lat. Horneman's Travels, p. 48.\n\n**HARVEST**, probably derived from a Saxon word signifying *herb fæft*, is that season of the year when the corn is ripe and fit to be reaped and gathered into barns.\n\n**Harvest-Fly**, a large four-winged fly of the cicada kind, very common in Italy, and erroneously supposed to be a grasshopper. See Cicada, Entomology Index.\n\n**Harvest-Home**, denotes the feast often observed at the close of harvest, and also the song used on that occasion. See December.\n\n**Harvey**, Dr William, an eminent English physician in the 17th century, was incorporated doctor of physic in Cambridge, afterwards admitted into the college of physicians in London, and was appointed lecturer of anatomy and chirurgery in that college. In these lectures he opened his discovery relating to the circulation of the blood; which, after a variety of experiments, he communicated to the world in his *Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis*. He was physician to King James I. and to King Charles I. and adhered to the royal cause. His works have eternalized his memory. In 1651, he published his *Exercitationes de generatione animalium*, a very curious work; but it would have been more so, had not his papers been destroyed during the civil wars. In 1654, he was chosen president of the college of physicians in his absence; but his age and weakness were so great, that he could not discharge the duty of that office; and therefore desired them to choose Dr Pringle. As he had no children, he settled his paternal estate upon the college. He had three years before built a combination-room, a library, and a museum; and in 1656 he brought the deeds of his estate, and presented them to the college. He was then present at the first feast, instituted by himself, to be continued annually, together with a commemoration speech in Latin, to be spoken on the 18th of October, in honour of the benefactors to the college; he having appointed a handsome stipend for the orator, and also for the keeper of the library and museum, which are still called by his name. He died in 1657.\n\nThis great physician had the happiness, in his lifetime, to find the clamours of ignorance, envy, and prejudice, against his doctrine, totally silenced, and to see it universally established. It has by length of time;\nHarwich, time, been more and more confirmed, and every man now fees and knows it from his own experience. It appears to be of the utmost importance in medicine; as it is perhaps impossible to define health and sickness in fewer words, than that the one is a free, and the other an obstructed, circulation. Dr Harvey was not only an excellent physician, but an excellent man; his modesty, candour, and piety, were equal to his knowledge; the farther he penetrated into the wonders of nature, the more he was inclined to venerate the Author of it.\n\nHARWICH, a town of Essex, in England, 72 miles from London. It is not large; but is well built and populous, has a good maritime trade, is almost encompassed by the sea, and has strong works. It is walled in; and the streets are paved for the most part with clay, which tumbling down from the cliff, where is a petrifying water between the town and Beacon-Hill, soon grows as hard as stone; and the inhabitants boast the wall is as strong and the streets are as clean as those that are of real stone. The harbour or bay is very large, safe, and deep; and is commanded by a strong fort on the Suffolk side, though not in that county. Here is a dock belonging to the government, with all conveniences for building, cleaning, and refitting men of war. A little way from the town, on a high hill called Beacon-hill, is a very fine light-house, which is seen at a great distance, and is very useful on this dangerous coast. At this place the packet boats which pass between England and Holland are stationed, and the town is much benefited by the passengers. The bay is so spacious, by the influx of the Stour from Manningtree, and the Orwell from Ipswich, and such use was made of it in the Dutch war, that 100 sail of men of war have been seen there at one time, with their tenders, besides 300 or 400 sail of colliers; for it is a perfect harbour to within two miles of Ipswich, and able to receive ships of 100 guns all the way. The inns here are very good; but the accommodations dear, by reason of the great concourse of passengers to and from Holland, which was the motive of fitting up sloops to go thither directly from the Thames, when the stage coaches that used to ply two or three times a week between this place and London were laid down. This place was first made a free borough, and had a grant of its market on Tuesdays in the reign of Edward II. Its government was settled by charter of King James I, in a mayor, chosen yearly, November 30, out of eight aldermen, who with 24 capital burgesses, the electors, and the recorder, make the corporation. By this charter it had also a power to elect two burgesses to parliament, the grant of its Friday market, and its two fairs on May-day and October 18, which are each for three days. The town has also an admiralty jurisdiction within its liberties, and the return of all writs, fines, &c. Though the entrance into the sea here is between two and three miles wide at high-water, yet the channel where the ships must keep to come to the harbour, which is on the Suffolk side, is deep and narrow; so that all ships that come in or go out are commanded by the guns of Landguard-Fort on that side. This town was fortified heretofore on the land side, but in the reign of King Charles I, the fortifications were demolished. It has since been ordered to be refortified. The church here, ever since the reformation, has been a chapel to the mother-church Harwood at Dover-Court.\n\nHARWOOD, a small but pretty town in the north riding of Yorkshire, with a costly stone-bridge of 11 arches over the Wharfe, which runs in a bed of stone, and is as clear as rock-water. Near it are the ruins of an ancient castle, built soon after the conquest; and which remained a neat strong building in Camden's time. It had a variety of masters; one of whom, in the reign of King John, obtained a grant for a market and fair here. In the reign of Edward III, it was valued at 400 marks a-year. This castle was ruined in the civil wars. It has eight or nine dependant constabularies, wherein are many antiquities. The remains of the castle, which seems to have been the keep, is in a condition to exist long. The castle itself covered near an acre of ground. Near it is now Harwood-House, one of the first houses in the county for elegance and superior embellishments; built on part of the site of Gawthorpe-Hall, now no more. In the church are some ancient monuments, particularly that of lord chief-justice Galtcoigne, who committed the prince of Wales to prison for striking him on the bench.\n\nHASLEMERE, a town of Surrey, in England, seated on the edge of the county next Hampshire, 43 miles from London, is an ancient place, and was once destroyed by the Danes. It is a borough by prescription, and has sent members to parliament ever since the reign of Edward IV, who are chosen by a bailiff and burgage-teeners. It is said to have had seven parish churches formerly, though but one church now, which is a chapel of ease to Chiddingfold; and that it stood heretofore upon a hill more to the south than the present town.\n\nHASSELQUIST, FREDERIC, was a native of East Gothland, and born in the year 1722. He prosecuted his medical and botanical studies at Upsal. The great Linnaeus having represented in his lectures what important advantages might be gained by a young student, by travelling through the country of Palestine, at that time but little known, Hasselquist felt the fire of ambition burn within him at the declaration of his master. The crown giving no pecuniary encouragement for undertakings of this magnitude, extensive collections were made by private individuals, especially from the country of our author, and stipends were granted him by all the faculties in the university of Upsal.\n\nProtected in this manner, he began his journey in 1749 during the summer season, and he obtained a passage to Smyrna in a Swedish East-Indiaman, through the influence of Lagerstroem. The Swedish consul at Smyrna received him in the most friendly manner, at which place he arrived about the latter end of the year. In the beginning of 1750 he let out for Egypt, and remained in the metropolis of that country for about nine months, from which place he transmitted to Linnaeus some specimens of his researches, which obtained the approbation of the public after they were published. By the influence of Dr Wargentin, a collection of 10,000 dollars of copper currency was made for the encouragement of young Hasselquist in the prosecution of his researches. In the spring of 1751, he passed through Jaffa to Jerusalem, and returned afterwards to Smyrna by the way of Rhodes and Scio, completely fulfilling the expectations of his country; but he did\nHasselt did not live long enough to reap the fruits of his labours. His lungs were affected by the burning deserts of Arabia, and after languishing for some time in great distress, he expired in February 1752, before he had finished the 30th year of his age.\n\nHaving been under the necessity of contracting debt, all his collections were seized upon by the Turks, who threatened to expose them to sale; but Queen Louisa Ulrica redeemed them by the payment of 14,000 dollars of copper money, and they arrived at Stockholm in a state of excellent preservation. They were composed of Arabian manuscripts, shells, birds, serpents, insects, &c. An account of his voyage was published by Linnaeus, by whom his memory was honoured with a plant which he called Hasselquinta.\n\nHasselquinta, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra clas, and in the natural method ranking under the 45th order, Umbellatae.

It is the chief of the cinqueports; and was formerly obliged to find 21 ships, within 40 days after the King's summons, well furnished and armed for service, and to maintain the crews a fortnight at its own charge. The town is supposed to have taken its name from Hastings, the famous Danish pirate, who used to build fortresses when he went ashore for his prey, to cover his men, and secure his retreat. In King Athelstan's reign here was a mint. This town had charters from Edward the Confessor, William I. and II. Henry II. Richard I., Henry III. Edward I. and Charles II., exempting it from Hastings' toll, and empowering it to hold courts of judicature on life and death. It is incorporated by the style of mayor, jurats, and commonalty. It has handsome houses, and customhouse officers; but frequent storms have rendered it an indifferent harbour, though a vast sum of money has been laid out at times to make it a good one. It has sent members to parliament ever since Edward III. London is supplied from hence with abundance of fish that are taken on the coast. The town lies between two high cliffs towards the sea, and as high a hill on the land side, having two streets, and in each a parish-church, divided by a stream of fresh water called the Bourne. About the year 1377, this town was burnt by the French; and after it was rebuilt, it was divided into the two parishes. Here are two charity-schools, erected for the teaching of 200 or 300 children. There was a castle on the hill, which overlooked the town, but it is now in ruins. The markets here are on Wednesdays and Saturdays; the fairs are on Tuesday and Wednesday in Whitun-week, and July 26. October 23. and 24. Here was formerly a priory. Hastings was a barony in the Huntingdon family, now in the Rawdon family.\n\nThis town is remarkable for a battle fought in its neighbourhood, between Harold king of England and William duke of Normandy, on the 13th of October 1066, in which the former was defeated and killed; and by his death William, named the Conqueror, became king of England: (see England, No 86.)—The night before the battle, the aspect of things was very different in the two camps. The English spent the time in riot, jollity, and disorder; the Normans in prayer and other duties of religion. The next day both armies prepared for battle. The duke divided his army into three lines: the first, headed by Montgomery, consisted of archers and light-armed infantry; the second, commanded by Martel, was composed of his bravest battalions, heavy-armed, and ranged in close order; his cavalry, at whose head he placed himself, formed the third line; and were so disposed, that they stretched beyond the infantry, and flanked each wing of the army. He ordered the signal of battle to sound; and the whole army, moving at once, and singing the hymn or song of Roland the famous peer of Charlemagne, advanced, in order and with alacrity, towards the enemy.\n\nHarold had seized the advantage of a rising ground, and having besides drawn some trenches to secure his flanks, he resolved to stand upon the defensive, and to avoid all action with the cavalry, in which he was inferior. The Kentish men were placed in the van, a post which they had always claimed as their due; the Londoners guarded the standard; and the king himself, accompanied by his two valiant brothers, Gurth and Leofwin, dismounting from horseback, placed himself at the head of his infantry, and expressed his resolution to conquer or to perish in the action. The first attack of the Normans was desperate, but was received with equal valour by the English: and after furious combat, which remained long undecided, the former, overcome by the difficulty of the ground, and hard pressed by the enemy, began first to relax their vigour; then to give ground; and confusion was spreading among the ranks, when William, who found him-\nself on the brink of destruction, hastened, with a select band, to the relief of his dismayed forces. His presence restored the action; the English were obliged to retreat with loss; and the duke, ordering his second line to advance, renewed the attack with fresh forces and with redoubled courage. Finding that the enemy, aided by the advantage of ground, and animated by the example of their prince, still made a vigorous resistance, he tried a stratagem, which was very delicate in its management, but which seemed admirable in his desperate situation, when, if he gained not a decisive victory, he was totally undone: he commanded his troops to make a hasty retreat, and to allure the enemy from their ground by the appearance of flight. The artifice succeeded against these inexperienced troops; who, heated by the action, and sanguine in their hopes, precipitantly followed the Normans into the plain. William gave orders, that at once the infantry should face about upon their pursuers, and the cavalry make an assault upon their wings, and both of them pursue the advantage which the surprize and terror of the enemy must give them in that critical and decisive moment. The English were repulsed with great slaughter, and driven back to the hill; where being rallied again by the bravery of Harold, they were able, notwithstanding their losses, to maintain the post and continue the combat. The duke tried the same stratagem a second time with the same success; but even after this double advantage, he still found a great body of the English, who maintaining themselves in firm array, seemed determined to dispute the victory to the last extremity. He ordered his heavy-armed infantry to make the assault upon them; while his archers, placed behind, should gall the enemy, who were exposed by the situation of the ground, and who were intent in defending themselves against the swords and spears of the assailants. By this dilution he at last prevailed. Harold was slain by an arrow, while he was combating with great bravery at the head of his men. His two brothers shared the same fate; and the English, discouraged by the fall of these princes, gave ground on all sides, and were pursued with great slaughter by the victorious Normans. A few troops, however, of the vanquished dared still to turn upon their pursuers; and taking them in deep and miry ground, obtained some revenge for the slaughter and dishonour of the day. But the appearance of the duke obliged them to seek their safety by flight, and darkness saved them from any farther pursuit by the enemy.\n\nThus was gained by William duke of Normandy, the great and decisive victory of Hastings, after a battle which was fought from morning till sunset, and which seemed worthy, by the heroic feats of valour displayed by both armies, and by both commanders, to decide the fate of a mighty kingdom. William had three horses killed under him; and there fell near 15,000 men on the side of the Normans. The loss was still more considerable on that of the vanquished; besides the death of the king and his two brothers. The dead body of Harold was brought to William, who restored it without ransom to his mother.\n\nHASTIVE, a French term, sometimes used in Hattive English for early, forward, or something that comes before the ordinary time or season. The hattive fruits are strawberries and cherries. We have hattive peas, &c.\n\nHAT, a covering for the head, worn by the men throughout the western part of Europe. Hats are said to have been first seen about the year 1400, at which time they became of use for country wear, riding, &c. F. Daniel relates, that when Charles VII. made his public entry into Rouen, in 1449, he had on a hat lined with red velvet, and furmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers: he adds, that it is from this entry, or at least under this reign, that the use of hats and caps is to be dated, which henceforward began to take place of the chaperoons and hoods that had been worn before. In process of time, from the laity, the clergy also took this part of the habit; but it was looked on as a great abuse, and several regulations were published, forbidding any priest or religious person to appear abroad in a hat without coronets, and enjoining them to keep to the use of chaperoons, made of black cloth, with decent coronets; if they were poor, they were at least to have coronets fastened to their hats, and this upon penalty of suspension and excommunication. Indeed the use of hats is said to have been of a longer standing among the ecclesiastics of Brittany, by 200 years, and especially among the canons; but there were no other than a kind of caps, and from hence arose the square caps worn in colleges, &c. Lobeinou observes, that a bishop of Dol, in the 12th century, zealous for good order, allowed the canons alone to wear such hats; enjoining, that if any other person came with them to church, divine service should immediately be suspended.\n\nHats make a very considerable article in commerce: the finest, and those most valued, are made of pure hair of an amphibious animal, called the caflor or beaver, frequent in Canada and other provinces of North America.\n\nHat-Making. Great improvements have been made in this art of late years by ingenious and intelligent manufacturers. For the following account of the different processes of this manufacture we are indebted to Mr Nicholson, from whose Journal it is extracted, and to John Glennell, Esq. of Newcastle, Mr Nicholson's correspondent on this subject, who has obligingly favoured us with some valuable corrections of this account.\n\n\"The materials for making hats are rabbits and hares fur cut off from the skin, after the hairs have been plucked out, together with wool and beaver. The former are mixed in various proportions, and of different qualities, according to the value of the article intended to be made; and the beaver is universally used for facing the finer articles, and never for the body or main stuff. Experience has shewn, that these materials cannot be evenly and well felted together, unless all the fibres be first separated, or put into the same state with regard to each other. This is the object of the first process, called bowing. The material, without any previous preparation (A), is laid upon a platform of wood,\n\n(A) Some writers mention a partial wetting of the fur while on the skin, by lightly smearing it with a solution of nitrate of mercury to give it a curl. Messrs Collinsons do not use it, or any other preparation.\nwood, or of wire, somewhat more than four feet square, called a hurdle, which is fixed against the wall of the work-shop, and is enlightened by a small window, and separated by two side partitions from other hurdles, which occupy the rest of the space along the wall. The hurdle, if of wood, is made of deal planks, not quite three inches wide, disposed parallel to the wall, and at the distance of one-fortieth or one-fiftieth of an inch from each other, for the purpose of suffering the dust, and other impurities of the stuff, to pass through; a purpose still more effectually answered by the hurdle of wire.\n\n\"The workman is provided with a bow, a bow-pin, a basket, and several cloths. The bow is a pole of yellow deal wood, between seven and eight feet long, to which are fixed two bridges, somewhat like that which receives the hair in the bow of the violin (b). Over these is stretched a catgut, about one-twelfth part of an inch in thickness. The bow-pin is a stick with a knob at each end, and is used for striking or catching the bow-string, by the vibration of which, as we shall shortly see, the stuff is thoroughly mixed. The basket is a square piece of ozier work, consisting of open strait bars with no crossing or interweaving. Its length across the bars may be about two feet, and its breadth eighteen inches. The sides into which the bars are fixed are slightly bended into a circular curve, so that the basket may be set upright on one of these edges near the right hand end of the hurdle, where it usually stands. The cloths are linen. Besides these implements, the workman is also provided with brown paper.\n\n\"The bowing commences by thovelling the material towards the right hand partition with the basket, upon which, the workman holding the bow horizontally in his left hand, and the bow-pin in his right, lightly places the bow-string, and gives it a pluck with the pin. The string, in its return, strikes part of the fur, and causes it to rise, and fly partly across the hurdle in a light open form. By repeated strokes, the whole is thus subjected to the bow; and this beating is repeated till all the original clots or masses of the filaments are perfectly opened and obliterated. The quantity thus treated at once is called a batt, and never exceeds half the quantity required to make one hat.\n\n\"When the batt is sufficiently bowed, it is ready for hardening; which term denotes the first commencement of felting. The material, thus far prepared, is seen on the hurdle dwelling in the centre, and lessening gradually towards the edges. The reason of this is obvious; the hat is formed of two of these batts joined together, and by their union the whole becomes equally compact. It is now pressed down by the convex file of the basket, then covered with a cloth, and pressed successively in its various parts by the hands of the workman. The pressure is gentle, and the hands are very lightly moved back and forwards at the same time through a space of perhaps a quarter of an inch, to favour the hardening or entangling of the fibres. In a very short time, indeed, the stuff acquires sufficient firmness to bear careful handling. The cloth is then taken off, and a sheet of paper, with its corners doubled in, so as to give it a triangular outline, is laid upon the batt, which last is folded over the paper as it lies, and its edges, meeting one over the other, form a conical cap. The joining is soon made good by pressure with the hands on the cloth. Another batt, ready hardened, is in the next place laid on the hurdle, and the cap here mentioned placed upon it, with the joining downwards: By this means, as we before stated, the mass becomes uniform in thickness, and assumes the form of a flannel bag. This last batt being also folded up, will consequently have its place of junction diametrically opposite to that of the inner felt, which it must therefore greatly tend to strengthen. The principal part of the hat is thus put together, and now requires to be worked with the hands a considerable time upon the hurdle, the cloth being also occasionally sprinkled with clear water. During the whole of this operation, which is called bafoning (c), the article becomes firmer and firmer, and contracts in its dimensions. It may easily be understood, that the chief use of the paper is to prevent the sides from felting together.\n\n\"The bafoning is followed by a still more effectual continuation of the felting, called working (d). This is done in another shop, at an apparatus called a battery, consisting of a kettle containing water slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, to which, for beaver hats, a quantity of the grounds of beer is added, or else plain water for rinsing out), and eight planks of wood joined together in the form of a frustum of a pyramid, and meeting in the kettle at the middle. The outer or upper edge of each plank is about two feet broad, and rises a little more than two feet and a half above the ground;\n\n(b) The bow is best made of ash; it is composed of the flang or handle: the bridge at the smaller end, or that which is nearest the window in the act of bowing, is called the cock; and the other bridge, which is nearer to the workman's hand, is called the breech.\n\n(c) After bowing, and previous to the bafoning, a hardening skin, that is, a large piece of skin, about four feet long and three feet broad, of leather alumed or half tanned, is pressed upon the batt, to bring it by an easier gradation to a compact appearance; after which it is bafoned, being still kept upon the hurdle. This operation, the bafoning, derives its name from the process or mode of working, being the same as that practised upon a wool hat after bowing; the last being done upon a piece of cast metal, four feet across, of a circular shape, called a bafon: the joining of each batt is made good here by shuffling the hand, that is, by rubbing the edges of each batt folded over the other to excite the progressive motion of each of the filaments in felting, and to join the two together.\n\n(d) Before this operation is begun, the hat is dipped into the boiling kettle, and allowed to lie upon the plank until cold again; this is called soaking, that is, being perfectly saturated with the hot liquor: if they are put in too hastily in this state, for they are then only bowed and bafoned, they would burst from the edges, each batt not being sufficiently felted into the other.\nground; and the slope towards the kettle is considerably rapid, so that the whole battery is little more than six feet in diameter. The quantity of sulphuric acid added to the liquor is not sufficient to give a sour taste, but only renders it rough to the tongue. In this liquor, heated rather higher than unpracticed hands could bear, the article is dipped from time to time, and then worked on the planks with a roller, and also by folding or rolling it up, and opening it again; in all which, a certain degree of care is at first necessary, to prevent the sides from felting together; of which, in the more advanced stages of the operation, there is no danger. The imperfections of the work now present themselves to the eye of the workman, who picks out knots and other hard substances with a bodkin, and adds more felt upon all such parts as require strengthening. This added felt is patted down with a wet brush, and soon incorporates with the rest. The beaver is laid on towards the conclusion of this kind of working. Mr Nicholson could not distinctly learn why the beer grounds were used with beaver hats. Some workmen said, that by rendering the liquor more tenacious, the hat was enabled to hold a greater quantity of it for a longer time; but others said, that the mere acid and water would not adhere to the beaver facing, but would roll off immediately when the article was laid on the plank. It is probable, as he observes, that the manufacturers who now follow the established practice, may not have tried what are the inconveniences this addition is calculated to remove.\n\n\"The journeymen tell me (says Mr Clennell), that the dregs are to hold or fill the body, whilst a little vitriol cleanses it of the dirt, &c., that may be on the rabbit or other wool; too much vitriol would make the whole that was weighed out to the journeymen work into the hats, but by the mutual action of the vitriol and the dregs, the quantity of the first being small, about a wine glassful, the dirt and the strong hairs get purged out (the last from the shrinking in being slow, as well as their being straight); for was the lessening of the size at plank rapid, they would, in defiance of their straightness, get entangled, and even as it is, they are slightly so; but care is taken to get them out by rubbing the body of the hat well with the hand in a circular manner) whilst, at the same time, the dregs keep the hats plump. Another advantage attending the use of dregs, whether of beer, porter, or wine, is that as the boiling in the dregs does not draw out much of the mucilage from each hat, when they come to be stiffened the dregs form a body within the hat sufficiently strong or retentive to keep the glue from coming through amongst the nap: vitriol alone would purge or weaken the hats too much, consequently, half the quantity does better with the addition of dregs, and they allow the body to be closer from its getting more work: many journeymen, however, to hurry this part of the process, use a quantity of vitriol, and open the body again by throwing in a handful or two of oatmeal; by this means they get a great many made, though at the same time they are left quite grainy from the want of labour. This, in handling the dry gray hat, when made, may be in part discovered, but in part only; in wearing the effect is thinning spots, as if of grease, but is, in reality, the glue lodging upon the grainy parts.\"\n\nOf these reasons for the use of dregs, the last only appears to be perspicuous or at all satisfactory. Acid of any kind, by taking out the greasy substances on each pile of hair, allows the roughnesses on the surface of each to operate with their full effect, and thus facilitates the mechanical action of felting; and Mr Collinon informed Mr Nicholson, that in a process called carrotting, they make use of nitrous acid. In this operation, the material is put into a mixture of the nitrous and sulphuric acids in water, and kept in the digesting heat of a stove all night; by which means the hair acquires a ruddy or yellow colour, like the inner part of a carrot, from which it derives its name, and though it loses part of its strength it receives a curl which more readily promotes the action of felting.\n\n\"It must be remembered, that our hat still possesses the form of a cone, and that the whole of the several actions it has undergone have only converted it into a soft flexible felt, capable of being extended, though with some difficulty, in every direction. The next thing to be done is to give it the form required by the wearer. For this purpose, the workman turns up the edge or rim to the depth of about an inch and a half, and then returns the point back again through the centre or axis of the cap, so far as not to take out this fold, but to produce another inner fold of the same depth. The point being returned back again in the same manner, produces a third fold; and thus the workman proceeds, until the whole has acquired the appearance of a flat circular piece, consisting of a number of concentric undulations or folds, with the point in the centre. This is laid upon the plank, where the workman, keeping the piece wet with the liquor, pulls out the point with his fingers, and presses it down with his hand, at the same time turning it round on its centre in contact with the plank, till he has, by this means, rubbed out a flat portion equal to the intended crown of the hat. In the next place, he takes a block, to the crown of which he applies the flat central portion of the felt, and by forcing a firing down the sides of the block, he causes the next part to assume the figure of the crown, which he continues to wet and work, until it has properly disposed itself round the block. The rim now appears like a flounced or puckered appendage round the edge of the crown; but the block being set upright on the plank, the requisite figure is soon given by working, rubbing, and extending this part. Water only is used in this operation of fashioning or blocking; at the conclusion of which it is pressed out by the same copper implement by which he drove down the card.\n\n\"Previous to the dyeing, the nap of the hat is raised or loosened out with a wire brush, or carding instrument. The fibres are too rotten after the dyeing to bear this operation; or if they could bear the operation, the colour of the hat would not be uniform, from a part of the nap having been confined, and consequently not receiving the full action of the dye liquor. The dyeing materials are logwood, and a mixture of the fulphates of iron and of copper, known in the market by the names of green copperas and blue vitriol. As the time of Mr Collinon was limited, and my attention, says Mr Nicholson, was more particularly directed to the mechanical processes, I did not go into the dye-house; but I have no doubt that the hats are boiled...\"\nwith the logwood, and afterwards immersed in the same solution, I particularly asked whether galls were used, and was answered in the negative.\n\n\"The dyed hats are, in the next place, taken to the stiffening shop. One workman, assisted by a boy, does this part of the business. He has two vessels, or boilers, the one containing the grounds of strong beer, which costs seven shillings per barrel, and the other vessel containing melted glue, a little thinner than it is used by carpenters. Our author particularly asked, whether this last solution contained any other ingredient besides glue, and was assured that it did not. The beer grounds are applied in the inside of the crown to prevent the glue from coming through to the face, and also, as he supposes, to give the requisite firmness at a less expense than could be produced by glue alone. If the glue were to pass through the hat in different places, it might, he imagines, be more difficult to produce an even gloss upon the face in the subsequent finishing. The glue stiffening is applied after the beer grounds are dried, and then only upon the lower face of the flap, and the inside of the crown. For this purpose, the hat is put into another hat, called a stiffening hat, the crown of which is notched, or slit open in various directions. These are then placed in a hole in a deal board, which supports the flap, and the glue is applied with a brush.\n\n\"The dry hat, after this operation, is very rigid, and its figure irregular. The next operation, therefore, is clearing with soap and boiling water to cleanse the glue from the nap or pile; it is then dried. The last dressing is given by the application of moisture and heat, and the use of the brush, and a hot iron, somewhat in the shape of that used by tailors, but shorter and broader on the face. The hat being softened by exposure to steam, is drawn upon a block, to which it is securely applied by the former method of forcing a string down from the crown to the commencement of the rim. The judgment of the workman is employed in moistening, brushing, and ironing the hat, in order to give and preserve the proper figure. When the rim of the hat is not intended to be of an equal width throughout, it is cut by means of a wooden, or perhaps metallic pattern; but as no such hats are now in fashion, Mr Nicholson saw only the tool for cutting them round. The contrivance is very ingenious and simple. A number of notches are made in one edge of a flat piece of wood for the purpose of inserting the point of a knife, and from one side or edge of this piece of wood there proceeds a straight handle, which lies parallel to the notched side, forming an angle somewhat like that of a carpenter's square. When the legs of this angle are applied to the outside of the crown, and the board lies flat on the rim of the hat, the notched edge will lie nearly in the direction of the radius, or line pointing to the centre of the hat. A knife being therefore inserted in one of the notches, it is easy to draw it round by leaning the tool against the crown, and it will cut the border very regular and true. This cut is made before the hat is quite finished, and is not carried entirely through; so that one of the last operations consists in tearing off the redundant part, which by that means leave an edging of Beaver round the external face of the flap. When the hat is completely finished, the crown is tied up in gauze paper, which is neatly ironed down. It is then ready for the subsequent operations of lining,\" &c.\n\nThis valuable memoir on the fabrication of hats is concluded with some observations on the probable gain or loss of employing machinery in the manufacture. These observations we recommend to the serious attention of every judicious hat-maker, who carries on his business on a large scale; for he will find them not the reveries of a rash speculator, but the cool reflections of a real philosopher, who is at the same time no stranger to the arts of life. They suggest the following subjects of enquiry; Whether carding, which is rapidly and mechanically done, be inferior to bowing, which does not promise much facility for mechanical operation? Whether a succession of batts or cardings might be thrown round a fluted cone, which rapidly revolving, in contact with three or more cylinders, might perform the hardening, and even the working, with much more precision and speed than they are now done by hand? Whether blocking or shaping be not an operation extremely well calculated for the operation of one or more machines? Whether loofe weaving and subsequent felting might not produce a lighter, cheaper, and stronger article? And how far the mechanical felting, which is not confined merely to the hairs of animals, might be applied to this art?\n\nMr Dunnage has proposed a method of making water-proof hats, in imitation of beaver, for which, in November 1794, he obtained a patent. This method is as follows: Let a flage be woven, of such count in the reed, and cut over such sized wire, as will give the hats to be manufactured from it that degree of richness, or appearance of fur, which may be thought necessary. The materials of which this flage may be composed are various, and should be accommodated to different kinds of hats, according to the degree of beauty and durability to be given them, and the price at which they are designed to be sold; that is to say, silk, mohair, or any other hair that is capable of being spun into an end fine enough for the purpose, cotton, inkle, wool, or a mixture of any, or all the above materials, as may suit the different purposes of the manufacturer. Those animal beifs, (says our author,) which are made with two poles, either of Bergam, Piedmont, or Organzine silk, rising alternately, in a reed of about nine hundred count to eighteen inches wide, with three floats over each wire. This method of weaving distributes the silk (as it may be put fingle into the harness), and prevents any ribby appearance which it might have if the silk were passed double, and the whole of the pole cut over each wire. This may be made either on a two or four thread ground of hard silk, shot with fine cotton, which he thinks preferable for floats, to silk, inkle, or any other material, as it forms both a close and fine texture. An inferior kind of hats may be made from any of the before mentioned materials, and with cheaper silk. This flage should be stretched on a frame, such as dyers use to rack cloth; then (having previously set the pile upright with a comb, to prevent its being injured or stuck together), go over the ground with thin size, laid on with a soft brush. For black, or dark colours, common size will do; with white or any light colour, use sizingflats, or a size made from white kid leather. These, or gum, or any other mucilaginous matter, which, without altering the colour, will prevent oil from getting through the ground so as to injure\ninjure the pile, will answer the purpose. Take care not to apply more of any material, as a preparation, than may be fully saturated with oil or varnish, so that water will not discharge it from the ground. The size, or rather glutinous matter, being dry, the pile must be tealeled, or carded with a fine card, till the silk is completely taken out of the twist or throwing, when it will lose its coarse shaggy look, and assume the appearance of a very fine fur. It must now be once more set upright with a comb, and you may proceed to lay on your waterproof material; this too may be varied according to circumstances. For black, or any dark colour, linseed oil well boiled with the usual driers, and thickened with a small quantity of any good drying colour, will do; for white, or very fine colours, poppy or nut oil, or copal or other varnishes, may be used. In this particular the manufacturer must judge what will best answer his purpose, taking care never to use anything that will dry hard, or be subject to crack. Mr Dunnage has found good drying linseed oil preferable to any other thing which he has used, and, with the precaution of laying on very little the first time, it will not injure the finest colours. When the first coat of oil is dry, go over it a second and a third time, if necessary, till you are convinced the pores of the ground are fully closed up, and the stuff rendered impervious to water. It should now stand several days, till the smell is sufficiently gone off, and before it is taken from the frame, should be gone over with some ox gall or lime-water, to take off the greasiness, which would otherwise prevent the stiffening from adhering to the oil. The material being now ready to be formed into hats, should be cut into proper shapes for that purpose. The crown should be made up over a block, with needle and silk, the oiled side outwards. The seams should then be rubbed with a piece of hard wood, bone, or ivory, to make them lie flat, and the edges of the stuff pared off very near the stitches, that no joint may appear on the right side. The seams should then be carefully gone over with the prepared oil, till every crevice or hole made by the needle is completely filled up, and the crown rendered perfectly waterproof. The crown may then be turned and stiffened, by sticking linen, leather, paper, or any other material that may be found to answer the purpose, to the inner or painted side, till it acquires about the same degree of stiffness, or resiliency to the touch, as a good beaver. The mucilaginous matter which he used to attach the stiffening to the crown, and the upper and under parts of the brim to each other, was composed of one pound of gum-arabic or senega, one pound of starch, and half a pound of glue, boiled up with as much water as reduced the whole to the consistence of a thick paste. A greater or less proportion of any of these ingredients may be used, and other glutinous and adhesive substances may answer the same purposes; or drying-oils may be made use of instead of this or other mucilage; or any of the resinous gums dissolved in oil or spirits; only it should be observed, in this case, the hats will require more time in the preparation, as the oily matter, unless exposed to the air, will not readily dry; but he found by experience that the above mentioned composition does not dry hard or brittle, but retains that pleasant flexibility which is agreeable to the touch, while it communicates to the other materials a sufficient degree of elasticity. Before the brim is perfectly dry, care should be taken to form a neck or rising round the hole where it is to be attached to the crown, by notching it round with a pair of scissors, and then forcing it over a block something larger than you have made the hole, so that the uncut stuff may turn up, under the lower edge of the crown, about a quarter of an inch. Before you join the crown and brim together, go over the outside of the neck of the brim, and the inside of the crown, as high as the neck will come (which should be about half an inch), with the prepared oil; and when they are nearly dry, so as to adhere to the finger on touching them, put the crown over the neck of the brim, and let them be sewed strongly together, taking care to sew down as little of the pile as possible, and using the same precaution of oiling, where the needle has been through, as was observed in making up the crown. The hat is now ready for dressing; which operation may be performed over a block, with a hot iron, brush, &c., in the same manner as those commonly called felts. When putting in the lining, be very careful to let the needle only take hold of the under surface of the brim; for should it perforate the upper one, the water will find its way through, and the hat be of no value. Though we have already declared how little we are acquainted with the operation of hat-making, we cannot help suggesting the enquiry, whether these waterproof hats might not be improved both in strength and beauty, by a slight felting before the application of the size by the brush. Such of them as are composed of wool or hair, or contain a mixture of these materials, are unquestionably susceptible of felting.\n\nDyeing of Hats. The instructions of Colbert direct hats to be first strongly galled, by boiling them a long time in a decoction of galls with a little logwood, that the dye may penetrate the better into their substance; after which a proper quantity of vitriol, and decoction of logwood, with a little verdigris, are added, and the hats continued in this mixture also for a considerable time. They are afterwards to be put into a fresh liquor of logwood, galls, vitriol, and verdigris; and where the hats are of great price, or of a hair which difficulty takes the dye, the same process is to be repeated a third time. For obtaining the most perfect colour, the hair or wool is to be dyed blue previously to its being formed into hats. But the following shorter process is generally practised.\n\nAn hundred pounds of logwood, 12 pounds of gum, and six pounds of galls, are boiled in a proper quantity of water for some hours; after which, about six pounds of verdigris and ten of green vitriol are added, and the liquor kept just simmering, or of a heat a little below boiling. Ten or twelve dozen of hats are immediately put in, each on its block, and kept down by cross bars for about an hour and a half; they are then taken out and aired, and the same number of others put in their room. The two sets of hats are thus dipped and aired alternately, eight times each; the liquor being refreshed each time with more of the ingredients, but in less quantity than at first.\n\nThis process (says Dr Lewis) affords a very good black on woollen and silk stuffs as well as on hats, as we may see in the small pieces of both kinds which are sometimes dyed by the hatters. The workmen lay great\ngreat stress upon the verdigris, and affirm that they cannot dye a black hat without it: it were to be wished that the use of this ingredient were more common in the other branches of the black dye; for the hatters dye, both on silk and woollen, is reckoned a finer black than what is commonly produced by the woollen and silk dyer.\n\nBut the general practice among hatters is to leave out the galls and verdigris, on account of the advance in price, and to use blue vitriol instead of them, in the proportion of 5lb. to 12 dozen of hats, which is found to answer the purpose equally well.\n\nHats are also made for women's wear, not only of the above stuffs, but of chips, straw, or cane, by plaiting, and sewing the plaits together; beginning with the centre of the crown, and working round till the whole is finished. Hats for the same purpose are also woven and made of horse-hair, silk, &c.\n\nHat is also figuratively used for the dignity of cardinal, or a promotion to that dignity. In this sense they say, \"to expect the hat; to claim, or have pretensions to, the hat,\" &c.\n\nPope Innocent IV. first made the hat the symbol or cognizance of the cardinals, enjoining them to wear a red hat at the ceremonies and processions, in token of their being ready to spill their blood for Jesus Christ.\n\nHATCH, or HATCHWAY, a square or oblong opening in the deck of a ship, of which there are several, forming the passageways from one deck to another, and into the hold or lower apartments. See Plate CLXIX., where A represents the main-hatchway of the lower deck; NN the fore-hatchway; and OO the after-hatchway.—There are likewise hatches of a smaller kind, called jetties. See UU in the same figure; as also the article SCUTTLE.—Hatches are also, though improperly, a name applied by sailors to the covers or lids of the hatchway.\n\nHATCHEL, or HITCHEL, in the manufactory of flax, hemp, &c., a tool, not unlike a card, for dressing and combing them into fine hairs.\n\nThey consist of sharp-pointed iron pins, or teeth, set orderly in a board.\n\nOf these there are several sorts, some with finer and shorter teeth, others with them coarser and longer.\n\nHATCHES, in mining, a term used in Cornwall, to express any of the openings of the earth either into mines or in search of them. The fruitless openings are called effay-hatches; the real mouths of the veins, tin-hatches; and the places where they wind up the buckets of ore, wind-hatches.\n\nHATCHES also denote flood-gates set in a river, &c., to stop the current of the water, particularly certain dams or mounds made of rubbish, clay, or earth, to prevent the water that issues from the stream-works and tin-washes in Cornwall from running into the fresh rivers.\n\nHATCHET, a small light sort of an axe, with a bail edge on its left side, and a short handle, as being to be used with one hand.—Hatchets are used by various artificers, and more particularly in hewing of wood.\n\nHATCHING, the maturing fecundated eggs, whether by the incubation and warmth of the parent bird, or by artificial heat, so as to produce young chickens alive.\n\nThe art of hatching chickens by means of ovens has long been practised in Egypt; but it is there only known to the inhabitants of a single village named Hatching, Berme, and to those that live at a small distance from it. Towards the beginning of autumn they scatter themselves all over the country; where each person among them is ready to undertake the management of an oven, each of which is of a different size; but, in general, they are capable of containing from forty to fourscore thousand eggs. The number of these ovens placed up and down the country is about 386, and they usually keep them working for about six months; as, therefore, each brood takes up in an oven, as under a hen, only 21 days, it is easy in every one of them to hatch eight different broods of chickens. Every Bermean is under the obligation of delivering to the person who intrusts him with an oven, only two-thirds of as many chickens as there have been eggs put under his care; and he is a gainer by this bargain, as more than two-thirds of the eggs usually produce chickens.\n\nIn order to make a calculation of the number of chickens yearly fo hatched in Egypt, it has been supposed that only two-thirds of the eggs are hatched, and that each brood consists of at least 30,000 chickens; and thus it would appear, that the ovens of Egypt give life yearly to at least 92,640,000 of these animals.\n\nThis useful and advantageous method of hatching eggs has been lately discovered in France by the ingenious Mr Reaumur; who, by a number of experiments, has reduced the art to certain principles. He found by experience, that the heat necessary for this purpose is nearly the same with that marked 32 on his thermometer, or that marked 96 on Fahrenheit's. This degree of heat is nearly that of the skin of the hen, and what is remarkable, of the skin of all other domestic fowls, and probably of all other kinds of birds. The degree of heat which brings about the development of the cygnet, the gosling, and the turkey-pout, is the same as that which fits for hatching the canary-long-finger, and, in all probability, the smallest hummingbird: the difference is only in the time during which this heat ought to be communicated to the eggs of different birds; it will bring the canary-bird to perfection in 11 or 12 days, while the turkey-pout will require 27 or 28.\n\nAfter many experiments, Mr Reaumur found, that floves heated by means of a baker's oven, succeeded better than those made hot by layers of dung; and the furnaces of glaas-houses and those of the melters of metals, by means of pipes to convey heat into a room, might, no doubt, be made to answer the same purpose. As to the form of the floves, no great nicety is required. A chamber over an oven will do very well. Nothing more will be necessary but to ascertain the degree of heat; which may be done by melting a lump of butter of the size of a walnut, with half as much tallow, and putting it into a phial. This will serve to indicate the heat with sufficient exactness: for when it is too great, this mixture will become as liquid as oil; and when the heat is too small, it will remain fixed in a lump: but it will flow like a thick syrup, upon inclining the bottle, if the stove be of a right temper. Great attention therefore should be given to keep the heat always at this degree, by letting in fresh air if it be too great, or shutting the stove more close if it be too small; and that all the eggs in the stove may equally share the irregularities of the heat, it will be necessary to shift them...\nHatching from the sides to the centre; and thus to imitate the hens, who are frequently seen to make use of their bills, to push to the outer parts those eggs that were nearest to the middle of their nests, and to bring into the middle such as lay nearest the sides.\n\nMr Reaumur has invented a sort of low boxes, without bottoms, and lined with furs. These, which he calls artificial parents, not only shelter the chickens from the injuries of the air, but afford a kindly warmth, so that they presently take the benefit of their shelter as readily as they would have done under the wings of a hen. After hatching, it will be necessary to keep the chickens, for some time, in a room artfully heated and furnished with these boxes; but afterwards they may be safely exposed to the air in the court-yard, in which it may not be amiss to place one of these artificial parents to shelter them if there should be occasion for it.\n\nAs to the manner of feeding the young brood, they are generally a whole day after being hatched, before they take any food at all; and then a few crumbs of bread may be given them for a day or two, after which they will begin to pick up insects and grubs for themselves.\n\nBut to save the trouble of attending them, capons may be taught to watch them in the same manner as hens do. Mr Reaumur assures, that he has seen above 200 chickens at once, all led about and defended only by three or four such capons. Nay, cocks may be taught to perform the same office; which they, as well as the capons, will continue to do all their lives after.\n\nHatching, or Hatching, in designing, &c., the making of lines with a pen, pencil, graver, or the like; and the interfeeling or going across those lines with others drawn a contrary way, is called counter-hatching. The depths and shadows of draughts are usually formed by hatching.\n\nHatching is of singular use in heraldry, to distinguish the several colours of a shield, without being illuminated: thus, gules or red is hatched by lines drawn from the top to the bottom; azure, by lines drawn across the shield; and so of other colours.\n\nHATCHMENT, in Heraldry, the coat-of-arms of a person dead, usually placed on the front of a house, whereby may be known what rank the deceased person was of when living: the whole distinguished in such a manner as to enable the beholder to know whether he was a bachelor, married man, or widower; with the like distinctions for women.\n\nHATFIELD, BISHOPS, a town of Hertfordshire, 19 miles north from London. It was called Bishop Hatfield, because it belonged to the bishops of Ely. Theodore archbishop of Canterbury held a synod here, anno 681, against the Eutychian heresy. Here was once a royal palace, from whence both Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth were conducted to the throne. King James I. exchanged the manor with Sir Robert Cecil, afterwards earl of Salisbury, for Theobald's, in the parish of Cheshunt in this county; and the lordship still remains in that noble family, who have a very fine seat here.\n\nHATFIELD and Chase, a town in the west riding of Yorkshire, four miles from Doncaster. The chase is famous for deer-hunting. There are many intrenchments near the town, as if it had been the camp of some great army. It is said that no rats were ever seen in this town.\n\nHATFIELD-BROAD-OAK, or King's Hatfield, a town of Essex in England, seated on a branch of the river Lea, 30 miles from London, is so called from the nature of the soil, from its tenure by King William the Conqueror and his successors, and from a broad oak growing in the town. It has a market on Saturdays, and a fair in August.\n\nHATTEM, a town of the United Provinces, in the duchy of Guelderland, seated on the river Uitrol, in E. Long. 6°. O. N. Lat. 53°. 30'.\n\nHATTEMISTS, in ecclesiastical history, the name of a modern Dutch sect, so called from Pontian Van Hattem, a minister in the province of Zeeland, towards the close of the 17th century, who being addicted to the sentiments of Spinoza, was on that account degraded from his pastoral office. The Verlichiots and Hattemists resemble each other in their religious systems, though they never so entirely agreed as to form one communion. The founders of these sects deduced from the doctrine of absolute decrees a system of fatal and uncontrollable necessity; they denied the difference between moral good and evil, and the corruption of human nature: from hence they farther concluded, that mankind were under no sort of obligation to correct their manners, to improve their minds, or to obey the divine laws; that the whole of religion consisted not in acting, but in suffering; and that all the precepts of Jesus Christ are reducible to this one, that we bear with cheerfulness and patience the events that happen to us through the divine will, and make it our constant and only study to maintain a permanent tranquillity of mind. Thus far they agreed; but the Hattemists farther affirmed, that Christ made no expiation for the sins of men by his death, but had only suggested to us by his mediation, that there was nothing in us that could offend the Deity; this, they say, was Christ's manner of justifying his servants, and presenting them blameless before the tribunal of God. It was one of their distinguishing tenets, that God does not punish men for their sins, but by their sins. These two facts, says Motheim, still subsist, though they no longer bear the names of their founders.\n\nHATTOCK, a flock of corn containing twelve sheaves; others make it only three sheaves laid together.\n\nHATUAN, a town and fort of Upper Hungary, in the county of Novigrad. It was taken by the Imperialists in 1685. It is seated on a mountain, in E. Long. 19°. 48'. N. Lat. 47°. 52'.\n\nHAVANNA, a sea-port town in the island of Cuba, in the West Indies, and on the north-west part of it, opposite to Florida. It is famous for its harbour, which is in every respect one of the best in the West Indies, and perhaps in the world. It is entered by a narrow passage, upwards of half a mile in length, which afterwards expands into a large basin, forming three Cul de Sac, and is sufficient, in extent and depth, to contain 1000 feet of the largest ships, having almost throughout six fathoms water, and being perfectly covered from every wind. The town was built by Diego de Velasquez, who conquered the island of Cuba. It was but a small place, and named originally the port of Carenas;\nHavana Carenas; but afterwards, when the city by its increase of wealth grew considerable, it was called St Christopher of the Havana. In 1536, it was of so considerable a value, that being taken by a French pirate, he ransomed the place for the paltry sum of 700 pieces of eight. Some time after it was taken by the English, and a second time by the French: nor was its value understood, or any care taken to put it in a posture of defence, till the reign of Philip II.; though what was then done proved insufficient. But since the accession of a branch of the house of Bourbon to the Spanish crown, more pains have been taken to render it a place of strength.\n\nThe Havana stands on the west side of the harbour, in a pleasant plain; and is the residence of the governor and captain-general of Cuba, and of the royal officers, as well as of an asylum for the affluence of the governor and captain-general of the West Indies. The bishop of St Jago de Cuba likewise chooses to fix his residence here. The buildings are elegant, built of stone, and some of them most superbly furnished. Here are eleven churches and monasteries, and two handsome hospitals. Near the middle of the town is a spacious square, surrounded with uniform buildings. The churches are rich and magnificent; the lamps, candlesticks, and ornaments for the altars, being of gold and silver; some of the lamps are of the most curious workmanship, and weigh near 100 weight. The Recollets church, which stands on the best ground in the city, has 12 beautiful chapels in it, and in the monastery are cells for 50 fathers. The church of St Clara has seven altars adorned with plate, and the nunnery contains 100 women and servants, all clothed in blue. The church belonging to the Augustines has 13 altars; that of St Juan de Dios 9, with an hospital for soldiers of 12,000 pieces of eight revenue. It is not a bishop's see, though the bishop of St Jago resides here, the revenue of which prelate is not less than 50,000 pieces of eight a-year. In 1700 the inhabitants were computed at 26,000, and we may very well imagine them to be increased since. They are a more polite and social people than the inhabitants of any of the Spanish ports on the continent; and of late imitate the French both in their dress and manners. The city is supplied with water by a small river called Laguia, which rises from the hills on the south-west side of the town, and divides itself into three streams, one of which falls into the sea on the east side of the town, but the other two flow through the place, entering the walls near the middle of the city.\n\nAs to the fortifications, it was already remarked, that the entrance to the harbour is by a narrow gut near half a mile in length: this passage is defended on the east side by a strong castle called El Moro, situated on a high rock; and on the walls and bastions are mounted 40 pieces of cannon. Under the faces of the south-west bastion of the Moro, and more within the entrance of the harbour, is a battery of stone called the Twelve Apollons, almost level with the water, and the guns of which carry each a ball of 36 pounds. A little higher, and opposite to the Point gate, is the La Divina Pallaora, or the Shepherd's Battery, of 14 guns, level with the water. On the west side of the entrance, at the point, is a square fort called the Punta, with four bastions well mounted with cannon, about 200 yards distant from the Punta gate of the town. On Havana, the bastions of the town, next the harbour, are a number of cannon; and about the middle of the city is another fort, called El Fuerte, a square fort with four bastions, mounted with 22 pieces of cannon, of no great strength; but in this last the governor resides, and in it the king of Spain's treasuries are deposited till the arrival of the galleons. On the land-side, from the Punta gate to the dock-yard, there is a rampart with bastions, faced with stone, and earthen parapets with a ditch, which in several places has fallen in, and is almost filled up, particularly behind the Punta and land-gates, near the stone quarries, which, if joined to one another, might be of great detriment to the place in case of a siege, as a lodgement might be made in them. The ground here rises with an easy ascent to the land-gate; and is either open pasture or garden ground, well flooded with the cabbage-tree. Before the land-gate is a ravelin. The hill on a rising ground from this gate (which is the highest part of the town) to the dock-yard, is steeper than on the other side.\n\nSuch are the fortifications of the Havana, which are the best the Spaniards have in the West Indies, as indeed the place is of the greatest importance. But though strong, they have many defects, and from the situation of the town and forts, are commanded by many eminences, of which an enemy could not fail to take advantage. On the east side of the harbour, the Cavannas, on a part of which the Moro is built, commands in a great measure that fort, but absolutely commands the Punta, El Fuerte, and whole north-east part of the city, which is the best fortified. On the west side of the city runs a suburb, called Guadaloupe, whose church is situated on an eminence about half a mile from the land-gate, with which it is on a level, and higher than any other part of the fortifications. From the north side of this rising ground, the Punta gate may be flanked; and from the south-east side the dock yard is commanded. Along the north side runs an aqueduct, which falling into the ditch at the land-gate, runs down to the dock-yard, both for watering the ships and turning a saw-mill. About half a mile from the church, is a bridge made over a rivulet that runs into the bay about 100 yards. That road leads to the centre of the island, and extends to Baracoa, above 600 miles distant. From this bridge to the Lazaretto, is about two miles, with a rising ground betwixt them. A trench thrown up between these two places would cut off the communication with the town by land. From these observations it will plainly appear, that the Havana, though well fortified, is not impregnable.\n\nThe Havana has greatly contributed to the maritime strength of the crown of Spain, many ships having been built here within these few years, from 60 to 80 guns, the island furnishing the finest materials, such as oak, pine, cedar, and mahogany. The only defect of the harbour is the narrowness of its entry; for though free from bars and shoals, yet only one ship at a time can enter it; from which circumstance the galleons have more than once been insulted, and some of them taken, at the mouth of the harbour, the forts there not being able to afford them any affiance.\n\nUpon the rupture with Spain in 1762, the British ministry sent a squadron and army against this place under\nHAVANNA, under the command of Admiral Pocock and Lord Albermarle. The Spaniards had in the harbour at the time a fleet of twelve sail of the line, two of them but just launched, two more on the stocks nearly finished, and several merchant ships. The men of war were almost ready for sea; but no account had reached the governor of the intended attack. The place, however, was gallantly defended, and sustained a siege of two months and eight days before it could be reduced; when a capitulation was signed, and along with the city was yielded a district of 180 miles to the westward. This conquest was without doubt in itself the most considerable, and in its consequences the most decisive, of any we had made since the beginning of the war; and in no operation were the courage, steadiness, and perseverance of the British troops, and the conduct of their leaders, more conspicuous. The acquisition of this place united in itself all the advantages which can be acquired in war. It was a military achievement of the highest class. By its effect on the enemy's marine it was equal to the greatest naval victory, and in the plunder it equalled the produce of a national subsidy. Nine sail of the enemy's line-of-battle ships were taken; three of their capital ships had been sunk by themselves at the beginning of the siege; two more were in wardrooms upon the stocks, and were afterwards destroyed by the captors. The enemy on this occasion lost a whole fleet of ships of war, besides a number of considerable merchant ships; and in ready money, in tobacco collected at the Havanna on account of the king of Spain, and in other valuable merchandises, the sum lost by the enemy perhaps did not fall short of three millions sterling.\n\nThe city of Havanna was restored by the peace of 1763; and is of the greatest importance to Spain, being the rendezvous for all their fleets to return from America to Europe, lying at the mouth of the gulf of Florida, through which they are all obliged to pass. Here the navy of Spain stationed in the West Indies ride; and here the galleons, the flota, and other merchant ships from other ports both of the continent and islands, meet in September, to take in provisions and water, with great part of their lading, and for the convenience of returning to Spain in a body. A continual fair is held till their departure, which generally happens before the end of the month, when proclamation is made, forbidding any person belonging to the fleet to stay in town on pain of death; and accordingly, on firing the warning gun, they all retire on board. — The commerce carried on in this port, which is very considerable; may be distinguished into the particular commerce of the island of Cuba, and that more general by the galleons and flota. The former consists in hides, usually styled of the Havanna, which are excellent, and of great value; sugar, tobacco, admirable in its kind, &c. Though strangers are prohibited to trade, yet a contraband commerce is carried on brisker here than at La Vera Cruz. Some little trade is carried on by other ports of Cuba, but it is very inconsiderable. As to the general commerce, this port is the place of rendezvous (as already mentioned) for all ships, particularly from Carthagena, Puerto Velo, and La Vera Cruz, which return to Spain from the Indies. The Havanna is regularly supplied with European goods only by the regifter ships from Cadiz and the Canaries. The flota and galleons bring there no more than the refuse of their cargoes, which they had not been able to dispose of at Carthagena, Puerto Velo, or Da Vela Cruz. When the fleet is in the harbour, provisions are excessively dear on shore, and money so plenty, that a Spaniard expects half a piece of eight a-day from a male slave, and a quarter from a female, out of what they earn for their labour. The fleet generally sails from thence, through the channel of Bahama, in the month of September; and is the richest in the world; since, in silver and merchandise, there is seldom less than thirty millions of pieces of eight on board, or six millions seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of our money.—It is natural to imagine, that a port of so much consequence as the Havanna ought to be well fortified. Since it has been restored to Spain, many new works have been added, to prevent if possible a similar disaster befalling it. W. Long. 82. 13. N.

Thus, supposing a ship to sail south-west, with the wind northerly, and some particular occasion requires to haul the wind more westerly; to perform this operation, it is necessary to arrange the sails more obliquely with her keel; to brace the yards more forward, by slackening the starboard and pulling in the larboard braces, and to haul the lower sheets further aft; and, finally, to put the helm a-port, i.e., over to the larboard side of the vessel. As soon as her head is turned directly to the westerly, and her sails are trimmed accordingly, she is said to have hauled the wind four points; that is to say, from south-west to west. She may still go two points nearer to the direction of the wind, by dipping her sails according to their greatest obliquity, or, in the sea-phrase, by trimming all sharp; and in this situation she is said to be close-hauled, as sailing west-north-west.\n\nHAUM, Halm, or Haw, among farmers, denotes the stem or stalk of corn, peas, beans, &c. from the root to the ear.\n\nHAUNCH, or Hanch, the Hip, or that part of the body between the last ribs and the thigh.\n\nThe haunches of a horse are too long, if when standing in the stable he limps, with his hind-legs farther back than he ought; and when the top or onset of his tail is not in a perpendicular line to the tip of his hocks, as it always does in horses whose haunches are of a just length. There are some horses which, though they have too long haunches, yet commonly walk well; such are good to climb hills, but are not at all sure upon a descent; for they cannot ply their hams, and never gallop slowly, but always nearly upon a full speed. The art of riding the great horse has not a more necessary lesson than that of putting a horse upon his haunches; which, in other words, is called coupling him well, or putting him well together, or compact. A horse that cannot bend or lower his haunches, throws himself too much upon his shoulder, and lies heavy upon the bridle.\n\nHAVRE, in geography, &c. a French term signifying the same with haven or harbour.\n\nHavre de Grace, a sea-port town of France, and capital of a district of the same name, is seated in the province of Normandy, on the English channel, in a large plain at the mouth of the river Seine. It is a small fortified town, nearly of a square figure, divided into two parts by the harbour, surrounded with a wall and other works, and defended by a very strong citadel. It is one of the most important places in France, on account of its foreign trade and convenient harbour; for which reason it was made a distinct government from the rest of Normandy. It was surprised in 1562 by the Protestants, who delivered it to Queen Elizabeth; but it was lost next year. In 1694 it was bombarded by the English, and also in the year 1758. E. Long. o. ii. N.

Though he embraced the state of an ecclesiastic, and enjoyed several benefices, he applied almost his whole life to mechanics, in which he made a great progress. He had a particular taste for clock-work, and made several discoveries in it that were of singular use. He claimed the discovery of moderating the vibration of the balance in watches by means of a small steel-spring, which has since been made use of. This discovery he laid before the members of the Academy of Sciences in 1674; and these watches are, by way of eminence, called pendulum. See Hookes watches; not that they have real pendulums, but because they nearly approach to the justness of pendulums. M. Huygens perfected this happy invention; but having declared himself the inventor, and obtained from Louis XIV. a patent for making watches with spiral springs, the Abbé Feuille opposed the registering of this privilege, and published a piece on the subject against M. Huygens. He wrote a great number of other pieces, most of which are small pamphlets consisting of a few pages, but very curious; as, 1. His perpetual pendulum, quarto. 2 New inventions, quarto. 3. The Art of Breathing under Water, and the means of preserving a Flame shut up in a small Place. 4. Reflections on Machines for raising Water. 5. His opinion on the different sentiments of Malebranche and Regis relating to the appearance of the Moon when seen in the Horizon. 6. The Magnetic Balance. 7. A Placet to the King on the Longitude. 8. Letter on the Secret of the Longitude. 9. A new System on the Flux and Reflux of the Sea. 10. The Means of making sensible Experiments that prove the Motion of the Earth; and many other pieces. He died in 1724.\n\nHAUTBOY, a musical instrument of the wind kind, shaped much like the lute, only that it spreads and widens towards the bottom, and is sounded through a reed. The treble is two feet long; the tenor goes a fifth lower when blown open: it has only eight holes; but the bass, which is five feet long, has eleven.\n\nThe word is French, haut bois, q. d. \"high wood;\" and is given to this instrument because the tone of it is higher than that of the violin.\n\nHAW, a sort of berry, the fruit of several species of mespilus, thence denominated hawthorns.

See Loxia, Ornithology Index.\n\nHAWGH, or Howgh, signifies a green plot in a valley as they use it in the north of England.\n\nHAWK. See Falco, Ornithology Index.\n\nHAWKERS, anciently, were fraudulent persons, who went from place to place buying and selling bras, pewter, and other merchandize, which ought to be uttered in open market. In this sense the word is mentioned anno 25 Hen. VIII. cap. 6. and 33 ejusdem cap.\nHawkers, cap. 4. The appellation hawkers seems to have arisen from their uncertain wandering, like those who, with hawks, seek their game where they can find it.\n\nThe term is now used as synonymous with pedlar; a person who travels about the country selling wares. Every hawker must take out an annual licence, for which he must pay 4l. and if he travels with a horse, ass, or mule, for every one of them 8l. If he travels without a licence, or contrary to it, he forfeits for every offence to the informer, and the poor of the parish where discovered, 10l. The acts relating to hawkers do not extend to makers of goods or their agents; or to those who sell goods in fairs or markets; to the sellers of fish, fruit, or other victuals; nor to the vendors of books and newspapers, 9 and 10 W. cap. 27. 3 and 4 Anne, cap. 4. But hawkers shall not, by virtue of such licence, sell or offer to sale any tea or spirituous liquors, though with a permit, under the penalty of having the same seized, and imprisonment and prosecution of the offender, 9 Geo. II, cap. 35.\n\nHawkers who were licensed on June 23, 1785, may set up any business in the place where they are resident inhabitants, though not brought up thereto, and may employ therein persons who have not been apprentices.\n\nHawkers, is a term also applied to those who go up and down London streets and country towns, selling newspapers, pamphlets, &c.\n\nHAWKESWORTH, John, a celebrated English writer, was born about the year 1719; though his epitaph, as we find it in the Gentleman's Magazine for August 1781, makes him to have been born in 1715. He was brought up to a mechanical profession, that of a watchmaker as supposed. He was of the presbyterian persuasion, and a member of the celebrated Tom Bradbury's meeting, from which he was expelled for some irregularities. He afterwards devoted himself to literature, and became an author of considerable eminence. In the early part of life his circumstances were rather confined. He resided some time at Bromley in Kent, where his wife kept a boarding-school. He afterwards became known to a lady who had great property and interest in the East India company, and through her means was chosen a director of that body. As an author, his Adventurer is his capital work; the merits of which, if we mistake not, procured him the degree of LL.D. from Herring archbishop of Canterbury. When the design of compiling a narrative of the discoveries in the South Seas was on foot, he was recommended as a proper person to be employed on the occasion: but in truth he was not a proper person, nor did the performance answer expectation. Works of taste and elegance, where imagination and the passions were to be affected, were his province; not works of dry, cold, accurate narrative. However, he executed his task, and is said to have received for it the enormous sum of 600l. He died in 1773; some say of high living; others of chagrin from the ill reception of his Narrative: for he was a man of the keenest sensibility, and obnoxious to all the evils of such irritable natures. On a handsome marble monument erected to his memory at Bromley in Kent is an inscription, of which the following is a part taken from the last number of The Adventurer:\n\n\"The hour is halting, in which whatever praise or censure I have acquired will be remembered with equal indifference. Time, who is impatient to date my last paper, will shortly moulder the hand which is now writing in the dust, and still the breath that now throbs at the reflection. But let not this be read as something that relates only to another; for a few years only can divide the eye that is now reading from the hand that has written.\"\n\nHAWKING, the exercise of taking wild-fowl by means of hawks. The method of reclaiming, managing, and bringing up a hawk to this exercise, is called falconry. See FALCONRY.\n\nThere are only two countries in the world where we have any evidence that the exercise of hawking was very anciently in vogue. These are, Thrace and Britain. In the former, it was pursued merely as the diversion of a particular district, if we may believe Pliny*, whose account is rendered obscure by the darkness of his own ideas of the matter. The primitive Britons, with a fondness for the exercise of hunting, had also a taste for that of hawking; and every chief among them maintained a considerable number of birds for that sport. It appears also from a curious passage in the poems of Ossian†, that the same diversion was fashionable at a very early period in Scotland. The poet tells us, that a peace was endeavoured to be gained by the proffer of 100 managed steeds, 100 foreign captives, and \"100 hawks with fluttering wings, that fly across the sky.\" To the Romans this diversion was scarce known in the days of Vespaian; yet it was introduced immediately afterwards. Most probably they adopted it from the Britons; but we certainly know that they greatly improved it by the introduction of spaniels into the island. In this state it appears among the Roman Britons in the fifth century. Gildas, in a remarkable passage in his first epistle, speaks of Maglocunus, on his relinquishing the sphere of ambition, and taking refuge in a monastery; and proverbially compares him to a dove, that hastens away at the noisy approach of the dogs, and with various turns and windings takes her flight from the talons of the hawk.\n\nIn after times, hawking was the principal amusement of the English: a person of rank scarce stirred out without his hawk on his hand; which, in old paintings, is the criterion of nobility. Harold, afterwards king of England, when he went on a most important expedition into Normandy, is painted embarking with a bird on his fist, and a dog under his arm: and in an ancient picture of the nuptials of Henry VI., a nobleman is represented in much the same manner; for in those days, it was thought sufficient for a nobleman to winde their horn, and to carry their hawk fair, and leave study and learning to the children of mean people. The former were the accomplishments of the times; Spenser makes his gallant Sir Tristram boast,\n\nNe is there hawk which mantleth her on pearch,\nWhether high tow'ring, or accoaling low,\nBut I the measure of her flight doe fear,\nAnd all her prey, and all her diet know.\n\nBook vi. canto 2.\nIn short, this diversion was, among the old English, the pride of the rich, and the privilege of the poor; no rank of men seems to have been excluded the amusements; we learn from the book of St Alban's that every degree had its peculiar hawk, from the emperor down to the holy-water clerk. Vain was the expense that sometimes attended this sport. In the reign of James I., Sir Thomas Monton is said to have given 100l. for a cask of hawks: we are not then to wonder at the rigour of the laws that tended to preserve a pleasure that was carried to such an extravagant pitch. In the 34th of Edward III., it was made felony to steal a hawk; to take its eggs, even in a person's own ground, was punishable with imprisonment for a year and a day, besides a fine at the king's pleasure: in Queen Elizabeth's reign, the imprisonment was reduced to three months; but the offender was to find security for his good behaviour for seven years, or lie in prison till he died. Such was the enviable state of the times of old England; during the whole day, the gentry were given to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field; in the evening, they celebrated their exploits with the most abandoned and brutish festivities; at the same time, the inferior ranks of people, by the most unjust and arbitrary laws, were liable to capital punishments, to fines, and loss of liberty, for destroying the most noxious of the feathered tribe.\n\nAccording to Olearius, the diversion of hawking is more followed by the Tartars and Persians than ever it was in any part of Europe. Il n'y avoit point de hute (says he) qui n'eust fon aigle ou fon faucon.\n\nThe falcons or hawks that were in use in these kingdoms, are now found to breed in Wales, and in North Britain and its isles. The peregrine falcon inhabits the rocks of Caernarvonshire. The same species, with the gyrfalcon, the gentil, and the gothawk, are found in Scotland, and the lanner in Ireland.\n\nWe may here take notice, that the Norwegian breed was, in old times, in high esteem in England: they were thought bribes worthy a king. Geoffrey Fitzpierre gave two good Norway hawks to King John, to obtain for his friend the liberty of exporting 100 cwt. of cheese; and Nicholas the Dane was to give the king a hawk every time he came into England, that he might have free liberty to traffic throughout the king's dominions.\n\nThey were also made the tenures that some of the nobility held their estates by, from the crown. Thus Sir John Stanley had a grant of the Isle of Man from Henry IV., to be held of the king, his heirs, and successors, by homage and the service of two falcons, payable on the day of his or their coronation. And Philip de Halifang held his manor of Combertoun in Cambridgehire, by the service of keeping the king's falcons.\n\nHawking, though an exercise now much abused among us, in comparison of what it anciently was, does yet furnish a great variety of significant terms, which still obtain in our language. Thus, the parts of a hawk have their proper names.—The legs, from the thigh to the foot, are called arms; the toes, the petty fingers; the claws, the pouncer.—The wings are called the sails; the long feathers thereof, the beams; the two longest, the principal feathers; those next thereto, the flags.—The tail is called the train; the breast-feathers, the mails; those behind, the thigh, the pendant feathers.—When the feathers are not yet full hawking grown, the is said to be unfurred; when they are complete, the is furred.—The pipe next the fundament, where the faces are drawn down, is called the pannel.—The flinty substance lying in the pannel, is called the glut.—The upper and crooked part of the bill, is called the beak; the nether part, the clap; the yellow part between the beak and the eyes, the fear or fere; the two small holes therein, the nare.\n\nAs to her furniture:—The leathers, with bells buttoned on her legs, are called bequits.—The leathern thong, whereby the falconer holds the hawk, is called the leaf or leaf; the little straps, by which the leaf is fastened to the legs, jeffis; and a line or pack-thread fastened to the leaf, in disciplining her, a creance.—A cover for her head, to keep her in the dark, is called a hood; a large wide hood, open behind, to be wore at first, is called a rufiter hood: To draw the strings, that the hood may be in readiness to be pulled off, is called unfricking the hood.—The blinding a hawk just taken, by running a thread through her eye-lids, and thus drawing them over the eyes, to prepare her for being hooded, is called feeling.—A figure or resemblance of a fowl, made of leather and feathers, is called a lure.—Her resting-place, when off the falconer's fit, is called the perch.—The place where her meat is laid, is called the hack; and that wherein she is set, while her feathers fall and come again, the mew.\n\nSomething given a hawk, to cleanse and purge her gorge, is called cafting.—Small feathers given her to make her caft, are called plumage.—Gravel given her to help to bring down her stomach, is called range: Her throwing up filth from the gorge after cafting, is called gleaming.—The purging of her grease, &c., is gleaming.—A being stuffed is called gurgiting.—The inferting a feather in her wing, in lieu of a broken one, is called imping.—The giving her a leg, wing, or pinion of a fowl to pull at, is called tiring.—The neck of a bird the hawk preys on, is called the inke:—What the hawk leaves of her prey, is called the pill or pelf.\n\nThere are also proper terms for her several actions.—When she flutters with her wings, as if striving to get away, either from perch or fit, she is said to bate.—When standing too near they fight with each other, it is called crabbing.—When the young ones quiver, and shake their wings in obedience to the elder, it is called couring.—When she wipes her beak after feeding, she is said to soak:—When she sleeps, she is said to yonk.—From the time of exchanging her coat, till the turn white again, is called her intermewing.—Treading is called cawking: When she stretches one of her wings after her legs, and then the other, it is called mantling.—Her dung is called muting: when she mutes a good way from her, she is said to slice; when she does it directly down, instead of jerking backwards, she is said to flime; and if it be in drops, it is called dropping.—When she as it were sneezes, it is called jutting.—When she raises and shakes herself, she is said to rouze.—When, after mantling, she crosses her wings together over her back, she is said to warble.\n\nWhen a hawk feizes, she is said to bind:—When after feizing, she pulls off the feathers, she is said to plume.—When she raises a fowl aloft, and at length\nHawking, descends with it to the ground, it is called *truffing*.\n\nWhen being aloft, the descends to strike her prey, it is called *flopping*. When the flies out too far from the game, she is said to *rake*. When, forfaking her proper game, she flies at pyes, crows, &c., that chance to crofs her, it is called *check*. When, missing the fowl, she betakes herfelf to the next check, she is said to *fly on head*. The fowl or game the flies at is called the *quarry*. The dead body of a fowl killed by the hawk, is called a *pelt*. When she flies away with the quarry, she is said to *carry*. When in flopping she turns two or three times on the wing, to recover herfelf ere she feizes, it is called *cancelling*. When she hits the prey, yet does not truls it, it is called *ruff*. The making a hawk tame and gentle, is called *reclaiming*. The bringing her to endure company, *manning* her. An old staunch hawk, ufed to fly and fet example to a young one, is called a *make-hawk*.\n\nThe reclaiming, manning, and bringing up a hawk to the fport, is not easy to be brought to any precise fet of rules. It confifts in a number of little practices and obervances, calculated to familiarize the falconer to his bird, to procure the love thereof, &c. See the article *FALCONRY*.\n\nWhen your hawk comes readily to the lure, a large pair of luring-bells are to be put upon her; and the more giddy-headed and apt to rake out your hawk is, the larger muft the bells be. Having done this, and she being sharp-set, ride out in a fair morning, into fome large field unencumbered with trees or wood, with your hawk on your fift; then having loofened her hood, whiftle softly, to provoke her to fly; unhood her, and let her fly with her head into the wind; for by that means the will be the better able to get upon the wing, and will naturally climb upwards, flying a circle. After she has flown three or four turns, then lure her with your voice, calling the lure about your head, having firft tied a pullet to it; and if your falcon come in and approach near you, call out the lure into the wind, and if the floop to it reward her.\n\nYou will often find, that when the flies from the fift, she will take fland on the ground: this is a fault which is very common with four-falcons. To remedy this, fright her up with your wand; and when you have forced her to take a turn or two, take her down to the lure, and feed her. But if this does not do, then you muft have in readinefs a duck fealed, fo that she may fee no way but backwards, and that will make her mount the higher. Hold this duck in your hand, by one of the wings near the body; then lure with the voice, to make the falcon turn her head; and when she is at a reafonable pitch, cast your duck up juft under her; when, if she strike, floop, or trufs the duck, permit her to kill it, and reward her by giving her a reafonable gorge. After you have practifed this two or three times, your hawk will leave the fland, and, delighted to be on the wing, will be very obedient.\n\nIt is not convenient, for the firft or fecond time, to show your hawk a large fowl; for it frequently happens, that they efcape from the hawk, and fle, not recovering them, rakes after them: this gives the falconer trouble, and frequently occasions the losfs of the hawk. But if the happens to pursue a fowl, and being unable to recover it, gives it over, and comes in again directly, then cast out a fealed duck; and if fle floop and trufs Hawking, it acrofs the wings, permit her to take her pleafure, rewarding her afio with the heart, brains, tongue, and liver. But if you have not a quick duck, take her down with a dry lure, and let her plume a pullet and feed upon it. By this means a hawk will learn to give over a fowl that rakes out, and on hearing the falconer's lure, will make back again, and know the better how to hold in the head.\n\nSome hawks have a difdainful coynefs, proceeding from their being high fed: fuch a hawk muft not be rewarded though fle fhould kill: but you may give her leave to plume a little; and then taking a thrip's heart cold, or the leg of a pullet, when the hawk is busy in pluming, let either of them be conveyed into the body of the fowl, that it may favour of it; and when the hawk has eaten the heart, brains, and tongue of the fowl, take out what is inclofed, call her to your fift, and feed her with it: afterwards give her fome of the feathers of the fowl's neck, to scour her, and make her caft.\n\nIf your hawk be a fately high-flying one, fle ought not to take more than one flight in a morning; and if fle be made for the river, let her not fly more than twice; when fle is at the highest, take her down with your lure; and when fle has plumed and broken the fowl a little, feed her, by which means you will keep her a high-flyer, and fond of the lure.\n\n**HAWKINS, SIR JOHN**, a very induftrious writer and valuable magiftrate, was born at London in the year 1719, where his father was employed as a builder and surveyor. He received an education for the fame profefion, but afterwards a clerk to an attorney. His employment being chiefly copying, he improved his mind in knowledge by rising early, and had made very great advances by the time that his clerkship ended. He was soon after admitted as an attorney, and his taste for music made him become a member of the Academy of Ancient Music. Having attained a degree of celebrity by publishing the words of two fets of cantatas, the music of which was furnished by Mr Stanley, he was introduced to fome valuable acquaintances who affided him in carrying forward his profefional views. In 1749 he was introduced as a member of a tavern club which had been instituted by Dr Samuel Johnson, and the connection thus formed between that great man and him was only difolved by death. In 1753 he married a daughter of Peter Storer, Esq., by which he obtained a very handsome fortune; and this being augmented by the death of Mr Hawkins's brother, he laid afide the profefion of an attorney, and lived as an independent gentleman. He afterwards became a judge of the peace for the county of Middlesex, and was both an active and ufeul magiftrate. Being extremely fond of angling, he became the editor of Watton's Complete Angler, which he enriched with notes of his own and a life of the author, a work which has been frequently republihed fince.\n\nHis \"Observations on the Highways\" brought him a liberal share of public approbation, and it has served as a model for all the acts which have fince been pafted. In 1765 he was chofen chairman to the quarter fefions, and in the year 1772 he obtained the honour of knighthood. Some of the notes to the edition of Shakespeare by Johnson.\nHawke. Johnson and Steevens were furnished by Sir John, who for many years was engaged in writing the history of music, which he finished in 1776, in five vols. 4to, dedicated to his majesty. It abounds with curious and original information, and may be considered as a repository of many useful things not elsewhere to be met with. His valuable library was destroyed by fire, which interrupted his literary labours, but made no change on the tranquillity of his mind. In the year 1787 his life and works of Dr Samuel Johnson appeared in eleven vols. 8vo. This life is a garrulous miscellany of anecdote, in which the author frequently wanders from his subject; yet it contains many facts respecting that extraordinary man which his enthusiastic admirers could with had been concealed. After this he prepared for the termination of his own life, which he perceived approaching, for he died in the month of May 1789, about 70 years of age.\n\nHawse, or Hause, is generally understood to imply the situation of the cables before the ship's stem, when she is moored with two anchors out from forward, viz. one on the starboard, and the other on the larboard bow. Hence it is usual to say, \"she has a clear hawse,\" or a foul hawse. It also denotes any small distance a-head of a ship, or between her head and the anchors employed to ride her, as, \"He has anchored in our hawse, The brig fell athwart our hawse,\" &c.\n\nA ship is said to ride with a clear hawse, when the cables are directed to their anchors, without lying athwart the stem; or croffing, or being twisted round each other by the ship's winding about, according to the change of the wind, tide, or current.\n\nA foul hawse, on the contrary, implies that the cables lie across the stem, or bear upon each other, so as to be rubbed and chafed by the motion of the vessel. The hawse accordingly is foul, by having either a crofs, an elbow, or a round turn. If the larboard cable, lying across the stem, points out on the starboard side, while the starboard cable at the same time grows out on the larboard side, there is a crofs in the hawse. If, after this, the ship, without returning to her former position, continues to wind about the same way, so as to perform an entire revolution, each of the cables will be twisted round the other, and then directed out from the opposite bow, forming what is called a round turn. An elbow is produced when the ship flops in the middle of that revolution, after having had a crofs: or, in other words, if she rides with her head northward with a clear hawse, and afterwards turns quite round so as to direct her head northward again, she will have an elbow.\n\nHawse-Holes, certain cylindrical holes cut through the bows of a ship on each side of the stem, through which the cables pass in order to be drawn into or let out of the vessel as occasion requires. They are fortified on each side by the\n\nHawse-Pieces, a name given to the foremost timbers of a ship, whose lower ends rest on the knuckle-timber, or the foremost of the cant-timbers. They are generally parallel to the stem, having their upper ends sometimes terminated by the lower part of the breakhead; and otherwise by the top of the bow, particularly in small ships and merchantmen.\n\nHawser, a large rope which holds the middle Hawser degree between the cable and tow-line, in any ship whereunto it belongs, being a size smaller than the former, and as much larger than the latter.\n\nHay, any kind of grass cut and dried for the food of cattle. See Agriculture Index.\n\nHay, a town of Brecknockshire, in Wales, seated near the confluence of the rivers Wye and Dulas. It was a town of good note in the time of the Romans; it being then fortified with a castle and a wall, which were ruined in the rebellion of Owen Glendower. It is at present a pretty good town; and the market is large for corn, cattle, and provisions. W. Long. o. 56. N. Lat. §2. 10.\n\nHayes, Charles, Esq. a very singular person, whose great erudition was so concealed by his modesty, that his name is known to very few, though his publications are many. He was born in 1678, and became distinguished in 1704 by A Treatise of Fluxions, folio; the only work to which he ever set his name. In 1710, came out a small 4to pamphlet of 19 pages, intitled, A new and easy Method to find out the Longitude, from observing the Altitudes of the Celestial Bodies; and in 1723, The Moon, a Philosophical Dialogue; tending to show, that the moon is not an opaque body, but has original light of her own. During a long course of years, the management of the late Royal African Company lay in a manner wholly upon Mr Hayes, he being annually either sub-governor or deputy-governor; notwithstanding which, he continued his pursuit after general knowledge. To a skill in the Greek and Latin as well as modern languages, he added the knowledge of the Hebrew: and published several pieces relating to the translation and chronology of the Scriptures. The African Company being dissolved in 1752, he retired to Down in Kent, where he gave himself up to study. May 1753, he began to compile in Latin his Chronographia Asiae, et Ægyptiaca, which he lived to finish but not to publish; which, however, was published afterwards. August 1758, he left his house in Kent, and took chambers in Gray's-Inn, where he died, Dec. 18, 1760, in his 82nd year. The title of his posthumous works runs thus: Chronographiae Asiaticae et Ægyptiacae Specimen; in quo, 1. Origine Chronologiae lxx Interpretum investigatur. 2.

See Hainault.\n\nHays, particular nets for taking rabbits, hares, &c. common to be bought in shops that sell nets, and they may be had larger or shorter as you think fit; from 15 to 20 fathoms is a good length, and for depth a fathom.\n\nAs rabbits often straggle abroad about mid-day for fresh grass, where you perceive a number gone forth to any remote brakes or thickets, pitch two or three of these hays about their burrows; lie close there: but in case you have not nets enough to inclose all their burrows, some may be stopped up with stones, &c. Then set out with the coney-dog to hunt up and down at a good distance, and draw on by degrees to the man who is with you, and lies close by the hay, who may take them as they bolt into it.\n\nHayward, the person who keeps the common herd or cattle of a town. He is appointed by the lord's court;\ncourt; and his office is to see that the cattle neither break nor crop the hedges of inclosed grounds.\n\nHAZEL, an officer belonging to Benhadad king of Syria, caused that prince to be put to death, and reigned in his stead. He defeated Joram, Jehu, and Jehoahaz, kings of Israel; and, after his death, was succeeded by Benhadad his son, 852 B.C.\n\nHAZARD, or Chance, in gaming. See GAMING.\n\nHAZARD, a game on dice, without tables, is very properly so called; since it speedily makes a man, or undoes him.\n\nIt is played with only two dice; and as many may play at it as can stand round the largest round table.\n\nTwo things are chiefly to be observed, viz. main and chance; the latter belonging to the caster, and the former, or main, to the other gamblers. There can be no main thrown above nine, nor under five; so that five, six, seven, eight, and nine, are the only mains flung at hazard. Chances and nicks are from four to ten: thus four is a chance to nine, five to eight, six to seven, seven to six, eight to five; and nine and ten a chance to five, six, seven, and eight: in short, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten, are chances to any main, if any of these nick it not. Now nicks are either when the chance is the same with the main, as five and five, or the like; or fix and twelve, seven and eleven, eight and twelve. Here observe, that twelve is out to nine, seven, and five; eleven is out to nine, eight, six, and five; and ames-ace and duce-ace, are out to all mains whatever.\n\nHAZLE, or HAZEL. See CORYLUS, BOTANY Index.\n\nThe kernels of the fruit have a mild, farinaceous, oily taste, agreeable to most palates. Squirrels and mice are fond of them, as well as some birds, such as jays, nutcrackers, &c. A kind of chocolate has been prepared from them, and there are instances of their having been formed into bread. The oil expressed from them is little inferior to the oil of almonds; and is used by painters and by chemists for receiving and retaining odours. The charcoal made of the wood is used by painters in drawing.—Some of the Highlanders, where superstition has not totally subsided, look upon the tree itself as unlucky; but are glad to get two of the nuts naturally conjoined, which is a good omen. These they call eno-chonshlatch, and carry them as an efficacious charm against witchcraft.\n\nEvelyn tells us, that no plant is more proper for thickening of copes than the hazel, for which he directs the following expeditious method. Take a pole of hazel (ash or poplar may also be used) of 20 or 30 feet in length, the head a little lopped into the ground; giving it a chop near the ground to make it succumb; this fastened to the earth with a hook or two, and covered with some fresh mould at a competent depth (as gardeners lay their carnations), will produce a great number of suckers, and thicken and furnish a cope speedily.\n\nHAZEL Earth, or Hazely Earth, a kind of red loam, which is said to be an excellent mixture with other sorts of earth; uniting what is too loofe, cooling what is too hot, and gently retaining the moisture.\n\nWitch-HAZEL.

See ANATOMY Index.\n\nHEAD-Ach, a most troublesome sensation in the head, produced by various causes, and attended with different symptoms, according to its different degrees and the place where it is seated. See MEDICINE Index.\n\nDragon's HEAD, in Astronomy, is the ascending node of the moon or other planet.\n\nHead of a Ship, an ornamental figure erected on the continuation of a ship's stem, as being expressive of her name, and emblematical of war, navigation, commerce, &c.\n\nHEAD, is also used in a more enlarged sense to signify the whole front or fore part of the ship, including the bows on each side: the head therefore opens the column of water through which the ship passes when advancing. Hence we say, head-falls, head-fea, head-way, &c.\n\nThus, fig. 1. Plate CCL represents one side of the fore part or head of a 74 gun ship, together with part of the bow, keel, and gunnel. The names of the several pieces, exhibited therein, are as follow:\n\nAA Fore part of the keel, with aa the two false keels beneath it.\n\nAC the stem.\n\naa The cat-head.\n\nbb The supporter of the cat-head.\n\ncc The knight-head, or bollard-timber, of which there is one on each side, to secure the inner end of the bowprit.\n\ndd The haufe-holes.\n\nee The naval-hoods, i.e. thick pieces of plank laid upon the bow to strengthen the edges of the haufe-holes.\n\nff The davit-chock, by which the davit is firmly wedged while employed to fish the anchor.\n\ngg The bulk-head, which terminates the forecastle on the fore side, being called the beak-head, bulk-head, by shipwrights.\n\nH The gun-ports of the lower deck.\n\nh The gun-ports of the upper deck and forecastle.\n\nI, I, The channel, with their dead-eyes and chain-plates.\n\ni The gripe, or fore foot, which unites the keel with the stem, forming a part of either.\n\nkk These dotted lines represent the thickness and descent of the different decks from the fore part of the ship towards the middle. The lowest of the three dotted lines expresses the convexity of the beams, or the difference between the height of the deck in the middle of its breadth and at the ship's side. This is also exhibited more clearly in the Midship-Frame, where the red curve of the beam is delineated. N.B. These lines must be always parallel to the lines which terminate the gun-ports above and below.\n\nmm The timbers of the head, and part of the bowsprit.\n\nX The rails of the head which lie across the timbers.\n\nOZ Fore part of the main-wale.\n\nRX Fore part of the channel-wale.\n\nUC The load water-line.\n\nFig. 2. represents a head-view of a ship, with the projection\nprojection of her principal timbers and all her planks laid on one side.\n\nIt is evident that the fore part of a ship is called its head, from the affinity of motion and position it bears to a fish, and in general to the horizontal situation of all animals whilst swimming.\n\nBy the Head; the state of a ship, which is laden deeper at the fore end than the after end.\n\nHead-Borrow, or Head-Borough, signifies the person who is the chief of the frank pledge, and had anciently the principal direction of those within his own pledge. He was also called burrow-head, bur/boulder, new borf-holder, third-borrow, tything-man, chief pledge, and borrow-elder, according to the diversity of speech in different places. This office is now usually called a high-constable. The head-borrow was the chief of ten pledges; the other nine were called hand-borrows, or plegi manus, &c.\n\nHead-Mould-shot, a disease in children, wherein the sutures of the skull, generally the coronal, ride; that is, have their edges shot one over another; and are so close locked together, as to compress the internal parts, the meninges, or even the brain itself. The disease usually occasions convulsions, and is supposed to admit of no cure from medicine, unless room could be given by manual operation or a division of the sutures.\n\nThe head-mould-shot is the disorder opposite to the horse-thoe head.\n\nHead-Pence, an exaction of a certain sum formerly collected by the sheriff of Northumberland from the inhabitants of that county, without any account to be made to the king. This was abolished by the statute 23 Henry VI. cap. 7.\n\nHead-Tin, in Metallurgy, is a preparation of tin-ore toward the fitting it for working into metal. When the ore has been pounded and twice washed, that part of it which lies uppermost, or makes the surface of the mass in the tub, is called the head-tin; this is separated from the rest, and after a little more washing becomes fit for the blowing-house.\n\nHead-Fast, a rope employed to fasten a ship to a wharf, chain, or buoy, or to some other vessel alongside.\n\nHead-Land, a name frequently given to a cape or promontory.\n\nHead-Dres, amongst the Jewith, Grecian, and Roman ladies, as among ourselves, was various, according to the different periods of time, and the fluctuation of fashion. In general, it principally consisted of their hair differently tricked out. It was usually divided before with a bodkin, into two equal parts; sometimes it was covered with a net, or put into a kind of purse, or tied behind in the form of a knot, or bound back and plaited with ribbands. It was washed with great care; essence and perfumes were applied to it, and gold dust sometimes made use of as powder. Pearls and jewels made a part of their ornaments; and pendants worn in the ear. To cover the defect of hair, periukes were made use of by the gentlemen of Rome. And we read that Otho had a covering of false hair, because he had not much of his own. See Hair and Jewels.\n\nBoth Grecian and Roman ladies wore têtes. But whether they ever built up their heads so high as the English, or our continental neighbours, will admit of Headmost a dispute.\n\nHeadmost, the situation of any ship or ships which are the most advanced in a fleet, or line of battle.\n\nHead-Rope, that part of the bolt-rope which terminates any of the principal sails on the upper edge, which is accordingly sewed thereto. See the article Bolt-rope.\n\nHead-Sails, a general name for all those sails which are extended on the foremast and bowsprit, and employed to command the fore part of the ship: such are the foreail, fore-top-sail, fore-top-gallant-sail, jib, foresail-fall, and the spritfall, with its topsail. This term is used in opposition to after-sails, viz. all those which are extended on the mizen-mast, and on the stays between the mizen and main-masts.\n\nHead-to-wind; the situation of a ship or boat, when her head is turned to windward.\n\nHead-Way, the motion of advancing at sea. It is generally used when a ship first begins to advance; or when it is doubtful whether she is in a state of rest or motion. It is in both senses opposed to retreating, or moving with the stern foremost. See the article Stern-way.\n\nHalfang, Healsfang, or Halsfang, in our ancient customs, signifies collybrigium or the punishment of the pillory. The word is compounded of two Saxon words; halp, neck, and paggen, \"to contain;\" Piena felicet qua alieni collum fringatur. The halfang, however, cannot signify a pillory in the charter of Canutus, De Forellis, cap. xiv. Est pro culpa solvatur regi duos fididos, quos Dani vocant halfhang.\n\nHalfang is also taken for a pecuniary punishment or mulct to commute for standing in the pillory; and is to be paid either to the king or the chief lord. Qui falsam testimonium dedit, reddat regi vel terre domino halfang.\n\nHealing, in its general sense, includes the whole process of curing or removing a disorder, and recovering health. In this sense medicine is defined the art of healing. In its more restrained sense, as used in surgery, &c., healing denotes the uniting or consolidating the lips of a wound or ulcer. The medicines proper for this intention are called incarnatives, agglutinatives, vulneraries, &c.\n\nHealing, in Architecture, denotes the covering the roof of a building. The healing is various; as of lead, tiles, slate, Horsham stone, shingles, or reeds and straw.\n\nHealth, is a right disposition of the body, and of all its parts; consisting in a due temperature, a right conformation, just connexion, and ready and free exercise of the several vital functions.\n\nHealth admits of latitude, as not being the same in all subjects, who may yet be said to enjoy health.\n\nThat part of medicine which shows the means of preserving health, is termed hygiene. See Medicine Index.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans deified Health, representing it under the figure of a woman, whom they supposed to be the daughter of Aesculapius. We find the name of the goddess Salus, or Health, on many medals of the Roman emperors, with different inscriptions;\nHEAM, in beasts, denotes the same with after birth in women. Thyme, pennyroyal, winter-favory, and common bore-hound, boiled in white wine, and given to a mare, are esteemed good to expel the heam. Ditany, applied in a pellary, expels the heam, as well as the dead foal; so also do fennel, hops, favin, angelica, &c.\n\nHEARING, the act or faculty of perceiving sounds. Hearing is reckoned among our external senses. Its organ is the ear, and particularly the auditory nerve diffused through the same; and its object, certain motions or vibrations of the air. Hence hearing may be more scientifically defined a sensation, whereby, from a due motion impressed on the fibrillas of the auditory nerve, and communicated thence to the sensory, the mind perceives and gets the idea of sounds. See ANATOMY, No. 141.\n\nHEARSE, among hunters, a hind in the second year of her age. See HUNTING.\n\nHearse is the name of a well-known carriage, used for conveying the dead to the grave. The word is also used by Shakespeare in his Henry VI. for a monument erected over a grave.\n\nHEART, in Anatomy, a muscular part of the animal body, situated in the thorax, on the anterior part of the diaphragm, between the two laminae of the mediastinum, wherein the veins all terminate, and from which all the arteries arise; and which, by its alternate contraction and dilatation, is the chief instrument of the circulation of the blood, and the principle of life. See ANATOMY, No. 121, 122.\n\nSeveral ingenious persons have from time to time attempted to make estimates of the force of the blood in the heart and arteries; who have as widely differed from each other, as they have from the truth, for want of a sufficient number of data to argue upon. This fact the truly ingenious Dr Hales upon making proper experiments, in order to ascertain the force of the blood in the veins and arteries of several animals.\n\nIf, according to Dr Keil's estimate, the left ventricle of a man's heart throws out in each systole an ounce or 1.638 cubic inches of blood, and the area of the orifice of the aorta be = 0.4187, then dividing the former by this, the quotient 3.9 is the length of the cylinder of blood which is formed in passing through the aorta in each systole of the ventricle; and in the 75 pulses of a minute, a cylinder of 292.5 inches in length will pass: this is at the rate of 1462 feet in an hour. But the systole of the heart being performed in one-third of this time, the velocity of the blood in that instant will be thrice as much, viz. at the rate of 4386 feet in an hour, or 73 feet in a minute. And if the ventricle throws out one ounce in a pulse, then in the 75 pulses of a minute, the quantity of blood will be equal to 4.4 lb. 11 oz. and, in 34 minutes, a quantity equal to a middle-sized man, viz. 158lb., will pass through the heart. But if, with Dr Harvey and Dr Lower, we suppose two ounces of blood, that is, 3.276 cubic inches, to be thrown out at each systole of the ventricle, then the velocity of the blood in entering the orifice of the aorta will be double the former, viz. at the rate of 146 feet in a minute, and a quantity of blood equal to the weight of a man's body will pass in half the time, viz. 17 minutes.\n\nIf we suppose what is probable, that the blood will rise 7 + \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet high in a tube fixed to the carotid artery of a man, and that the inward area of the left ventricle of his heart is equal to 15 square inches, these multiplied into 7 + \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) feet, give 1350 cubic inches of blood, which presses on that ventricle, when it first begins to contract, a weight equal to 15.5 pounds.\n\nWhat the doctor thus calculates, from supposition, with regard to mankind, he actually experimented upon horses, dogs, fallow-does, &c. by fixing tubes in orifices opened in their veins and arteries; by observing the several heights to which the blood rose in these tubes, as they lay on the ground; and by measuring the capacities of the ventricles of the heart and orifices of the arteries. And, that the reader may the more readily compare the said estimates together, he has given a table of them, ranged in the following order.\nHeart-Burn, a disease usually called cardialgia by physicians. In surfeits, or upon swallowing without due mastication; when meats are eaten tough and fat, or with farinaceous substances unfermented; or when by any accident the saliva is vitiated, too scanty, or not intimately mixed with the food, the fermentation becomes tumultuous, the stomach swells with air, and this extraordinary commotion being attended with an unusual heat, brings on the uneasiness called the heart-burn; which is remedied by whatever promotes a greater secretion of saliva, or helps to mix it with our aliment. The tallowy powders, as oyster-shells, crabs-eyes, chalk, &c., are the usual remedies for the heart-burn.\n\nHEARTH, that part of the pavement of a room on which the fire is immediately placed.\n\nHEARTH-Money. See Chimney-Money.\n\nHEAT, in Physiology, has a double meaning; being put either for that peculiar sensation which is felt on the approach of burning bodies, or for the cause of that sensation; in which last sense it is synonymous with Fire. This mode of speaking, however, is inaccurate, and, by confounding the effect with the cause, sometimes produces obscurity: it were to be wished therefore that the word heat was used only to denote the effect; and fire, or some other term, to denote the cause of that effect.\n\nThe disputes which formerly were so much agitated in the learned world concerning the nature of heat, viz. whether it consisted merely in the motion of the terrestrial particles of bodies, or in that of a subtile fluid, are now mostly ceased, and it is almost universally believed to be the effect of a fluid. See Chemistry Index.\n\nHeat of Burning Bodies. See Combustion, Chemistry Index.\n\nHeat of Chemical Mixtures. See Chemistry Index.\n\nMethod of Measuring Heat. See Thermometer and Pyrometer, Chemistry Index.\n\nDegrees of Heat which Animals are capable of bearing.—The ancients were of opinion, that all countries lying within the tropics were uninhabitable by reason of their heat: but time has discovered their mistake; and it is now found, that no part of the world is too hot for mankind to live in. The learned Professor Boerhaave, in his chemistry, relates certain experiments made with great accuracy by the celebrated Fahrenheit, and others, at his desire, on this subject, in a sugar-baker's office; where the heat, at the time of making the experiments, was up to 146 degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. A sparrow, subjected to air thus heated, died, after breathing very laboriously, in less than seven minutes. A cat resisted this great heat somewhat above a quarter of an hour; and a dog about 28 minutes, discharging before his death a considerable quantity of a ruddy coloured foam, and exhaled a stench so peculiarly offensive, as to throw one of the assistants into a fainting fit. This dissolution of the humours, or great change from a natural state,\nHeat, the professor attributes not to the heat of the stove alone, which would not have produced any such effect on the flesh of a dead animal; but likewise to the vital motion, by which a still greater degree of heat, he supposes, was produced in the fluids circulating through the lungs, in consequence of which the oils, fats, and spirits of the animal became so highly exalted.\n\nMessieurs Du Hamel and Tillet having been sent into the province of Augenois, in the years 1763 and 1764, with a view of endeavouring to destroy an insect which consumed the grain of that province, effected the same in the manner related in the Memoirs for 1761, by exposing the affected corn, with the insects included in it, in an oven, where the heat was sufficient to kill them without injuring the grain. This operation was performed at Rochefoucault, in a large public oven, where, for economical views, their first step was to affix themselves of the heat remaining in it on the day after bread had been baked in it. This they did, by conveying in a thermometer on the end of a shovel, which, on its being withdrawn, indicated a degree of heat considerably above that of boiling water; but M. Tillet, convinced that the thermometer had fallen several degrees in drawing to the mouth of the oven, and appearing under some embarrassment on that head, a girl, one of the attendants on the oven, offered to enter, and mark with a pencil the height at which the thermometer stood within the oven. The girl smiled on M. Tillet's appearance to hesitate at this strange proposition; and entering the oven, with a pencil given her for that purpose, marked the thermometer, after staying two or three minutes, standing at 100 degrees of Reaumur's scale, or, to make use of a scale better known in this country, at near 260 degrees of Fahrenheit's. M. Tillet began to express an anxiety for the welfare of his female assistant, and to press her return. This female salamander, however, assuring him that she felt no inconvenience from her situation, remained there 10 minutes longer; that is, near the time when Boerhaave's cat parted with her nine lives under a much less degree of heat; when the thermometer standing at 288 degrees, or 76 degrees above that of boiling water, the same out of the oven, her complexion indeed considerably heightened, but her respiration by no means quick or laborious. After M. Tillet's return to Paris, these experiments were repeated by Mons. Marantin, commissaire de guerre, at Rochefoucault, an intelligent and accurate observer, on a second girl belonging to the oven, who remained in it, without much inconvenience, under the same degree of heat, as long as her predecessor; and even breathed an air heated to about 325 degrees for the space of five minutes.\n\nM. Tillet endeavoured to clear up the very apparent contrariety between these experiments and those made under the direction of Boerhaave, by subjecting various animals, under different circumstances, to great degrees of heat. From his experiments, in some of which the animals were swaddled with clothes, and were thereby enabled to resist for a much longer time the effects of the extraordinary heat, he infers, that the heat of the air received into the lungs was not, as was supposed by Boerhaave, the only or principal cause of the anxiety, laborious breathing, and death, of the animals on whom his experiments were made; but that the hot air, which had free and immediate access to every part of the surface of their bodies, penetrated the substance on all sides, and brought on a fever, from whence proceeded all the symptoms: on the contrary, the girls at Rochefoucault, having their bodies in great measure protected from this action by their clothes, were enabled to breathe the air, thus violently heated, for a long time without great inconvenience. In fact, we should think too, that the bulk of their bodies, though not thought of much consequence by M. Tillet, appears to have contributed not a little to their security. In common respiration, the blood, in its passage through the lungs, is cooled by being brought into contact with the external inspired air. In the present experiments, on the contrary, the vessels and vessels of the lungs receiving at each inspiration an air heated to 300 degrees, must have been continually cooled and refreshed, as well as the subcutaneous vessels, by the successive arrival of the whole mass of blood contained in the interior parts of the body, whose heat might be supposed at the beginning of the experiment not to exceed 100 degrees. Not to mention, that M. Tillet's two girls may not possibly have been subjected to so great a degree of heat as that indicated by the thermometer; which appears to us to have always remained on the shovel, in contact with the earth.\n\nThese experiments soon excited other philosophers to make similar ones, of which some very remarkable ones are those of Dr Dobson at Liverpool, who gives the following account of them in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. lxv.\n\n\"I. The sweating-room of our public hospital at Liverpool, which is nearly a cube of nine feet, lighted from the top, was heated till the quicksilver stood at 224° on Fahrenheit's scale, nor would the tube of the thermometer indeed admit the heat to be raised higher. The thermometer was suspended by a string fixed to the wooden frame of the sky-light, and hung down about the centre of the room. Myself and several others were at this time inclosed in the stove, without experiencing any oppressive or painful sensation of heat proportioned to the degree pointed out by the thermometer. Every metallic substance about us soon became very hot.\n\n\"II. My friend Mr Park, an ingenious surgeon of this place, went into the stove heated to 202°. After ten minutes, I found the pulse quickened to 120. And to determine the increase of the animal heat, another thermometer was handed to him, in which the quicksilver already stood at 98°; but it rose only to 99°, whether the bulb of the thermometer was inclosed in the palms of the hands or received in the mouth (a). The natural state of this gentleman's pulse is about 65.\n\n\"III. Another gentleman went through the same experiment\n\n(a) The scale of the thermometer, which was suspended by the string about the middle of the room, was of metal;\nexperiment in the same circumstances, and with the same effects.\n\n\"IV. One of the porters to the hospital, a healthy young man, and the pulse 75, was inclosed in the stove when the quicksilver stood at 210°; and he remained there, with little inconvenience, for 20 minutes. The pulse, now 164, and the animal heat, determined by another thermometer as in the former experiments, was 101°.\n\n\"V. A young gentleman of a delicate and irritable habit, whose natural pulse is about 80, remained in the stove ten minutes when heated to 224°. The pulse rose to 145, and the animal heat to 102°. This gentleman, who had been frequently in the stove during the course of the day, found himself feeble, and obliged to break out into sweats for 24 hours after the experiment.\n\n\"VI. Two small tin vessels, containing each the white of an egg, were put into the stove heated to 224°. One of them was placed on a wooden seat near the wall, and the other suspended by a string about the middle of the stove. After ten minutes, they began to coagulate; but the coagulation was sensibly quicker and firmer in that which was suspended, than in that which was placed on the wooden seat. The progress of the coagulation was as follows: it was first formed on the sides, and gradually extended itself; the whole of the bottom was next coagulated; and last of all, the middle part of the top.\n\n\"VII. Part of the shell of an egg was peeled away, leaving only the film which surrounds the white; and part of the white being drawn out, the film sunk to form a little cup. This cup was filled with some of the albumen ovum, which was consequently detached as much as possible from everything but the cup. The lower part of the egg stood upon some light tow in a common gallipot, and was placed on the wooden seat in the stove. The quicksilver in the thermometer still continued at 224°. After remaining in the stove for an hour, the lower part of the egg which was covered with the shell was firmly coagulated, but that which was in the little cup was fluid and transparent. At the end of another hour it was still fluid, except on the edges where it was thin; and here it was still transparent; a sufficient proof that it was dried, not coagulated.\n\n\"VIII. A piece of bees-wax, placed in the same situation with the albumen ovum of the preceding experiment, and exposed to the same degree of heat in the stove, began to melt in five minutes; another piece suspended by a string, and a third piece put into the tin vessel and suspended, began likewise to liquefy in five minutes.\n\nEven these experiments, though more accurate than the former, do not show the utmost degrees of heat which the human body is capable of enduring. Some others, still more remarkable (as in them the body was exposed to the heat without clothes), by Drs Fordyce and Blagden, are also recorded in the Philosophical Transactions. They were made in rooms heated by flues in the floor, and by pouring upon it boiling water. There was no chimney in them, or any vent for the air, excepting through crevices at the door. In the first room were placed three thermometers, one in the hottest part of it, another in the coolest part, and a third on the table, to be used occasionally in the course of the experiment. Of these experiments, the two following may be taken as a specimen:\n\n\"About three hours after breakfast, Dr Fordyce having taken off all his clothes, except his shirt, and being furnished with wooden shoes tied on with laces, went into one of the rooms, where he stood five minutes in a heat of 90°, and begun to sweat gently. He then entered another room, and stood in a part of it heated to 110°. In about half a minute his shirt became so wet that he was obliged to throw it aside, and then the water poured down in streams over his whole body. Having remained in this heat for ten minutes, he removed to a part of the room heated to 120°; and after staying there 20 minutes, found that the thermometer placed under his tongue, and held in his hand, stood just at 100°, and that his urine was of the same temperature. His pulse had gradually risen to 145 pulsations in a minute. The external circulation was greatly increased, the veins had become very large, and an universal redness had diffused itself all over the body, attended with a strong feeling of heat; his respiration, however, was little affected. He concluded this experiment by plunging in water heated to 100°; and after being wiped dry, was carried home in a chair; but the circulation did not subside for two hours.\n\n\"Dr Blagden took off his coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and went into one of the rooms, as soon as the thermometer had indicated a degree of heat above that of boiling water. The first impression of this hot air upon his body was exceedingly disagreeable, but in a few minutes all his uneasiness was removed by the breaking out of a sweat. At the end of 12 minutes he left the room very much fatigued, but no otherwise disordered. His pulse beat 136 in a minute, and the thermometer had risen to 220 degrees.\n\nIn others of these experiments it was found, that a heat even of 260° of Fahrenheit's thermometer could be submitted to with tolerable ease. But it must be observed, that in these great heats every piece of metal they carried about with them became intolerably hot. Small quantities of water placed in metallic vessels quickly boiled; but in a common earthen vessel it required an hour and a half to arrive at a temperature of 140°, nor could it ever be brought near the boiling point. Neither durst the people, who with impunity breathed the air of this very hot room at 264 degrees, bear to put their fingers into the boiling water, which indicated only a heat of 212°. So far\n\nmetal; this was the only one I could then procure on which the degrees ran so high as to give any scope to the experiment. The scale of the other thermometer, which was employed for ascertaining the variations in the animal heat, was of ivory.\nfrom this, they could not bear the touch of quicksilver heated only to $120^\\circ$, and could but just bear spirit of wine at $130^\\circ$.\n\n**Animal Heat.** Of this there are various degrees; some animals preserving a heat of $100^\\circ$ or more in all the different temperatures of the atmosphere; others keep only a few degrees warmer than the medium which surrounds them; and in some of the more imperfect animals, the heat is scarcely one degree above the air or water in which they live.\n\nThe phenomenon of animal heat hath, from the earliest ages, been the subject of philosophical discussion; and, like most other subjects of this nature, its cause is not yet ascertained. The best treatises that have appeared on the subject are those of Dr Dugald Lefèvre, published in 1778; and Mr Adair Crawford, in 1779. From the first of these performances, the following account of the different opinions on this subject is extracted.\n\n\"The ancients possessed not the requisites for minutely investigating the science of nature; and, prone to superstition, attributed every phenomenon which eluded their investigation to the influence of a supernatural power. Hippocrates, the father and founder of medicine, accounted animal heat a mystery, and bestowed on it many attributes of the Deity. In treating of that subject, he says in express terms, 'what we call heat, appears to me to be something immortal, which understands, sees, hears, and knows everything present and to come.'—Aristotle seems to have considered the subject particularly, but nothing is to be met with in his works that can be said to throw light upon it.—Galen tells us that the dispute between the philosophers and physicians of his time was, 'whether animal-heat depended on the motion of the heart and arteries; or whether, as the motion of the heart and arteries was innate, the heat was not also innate.' Both these opinions, however, he rejects; and attempts a solution of the question on his favourite system, namely, the peripatetic philosophy; but his leading principles being erroneous, his deductions are of course inadmissible.\n\n\"To enter into a minute detail of all the opinions offered by the moderns on the cause of animal-heat, would far exceed our limits. Most of them, however, may be referred to one or other of the three general causes of heat, viz.: mixture, fermentation, and mechanical means, or friction. See Chemistry Index.\"\n\n**Internal Heat of the Earth.** It was formerly supposed that the heat of the earth increased in proportion to the depth from the surface; but this hypothesis proceeded from imperfect and inaccurate observation, or from the preconceived notion of the existence of central fires. At great depths, it seems not impossible that the temperature of the earth is uniformly and invariably the same; that is, at depths beyond the more immediate influence of the sun's rays. But at moderate depths, so far as observation and experiment go, the temperature of the earth is precisely the same as the average temperature of the climate where the observation is made. This fact, which is established by the uniform temperature of springs corresponding exactly with the average temperature of the climate, seems to be an irresistible argument against the opinion of the existence of central fires.\n\nThis heat of the earth has been variously explained. Some have had recourse to an immense body of fire lodged in the centre of the earth, which they consider as a central sun, and the great principle of the generation, vegetation, nutrition, &c., of fossil and vegetable bodies. But Mr Boyle, who had been at the bottom of some mines himself, suspects that this degree of heat, at least in some of them, may arise from the peculiar nature of the minerals generated therein. To confirm this, he instances a mineral of a vitriolic kind, dug up in large quantities in many parts of England, which by the bare affusion of common water will grow so hot, that it will almost take fire.—These hypotheses are liable to the following objections: 1. If there is within the earth a body of actual fire, it seems difficult to show why that fire should not consume and moulder away the outer shell of earth, till either the earth was totally destroyed, or the fire extinguished. 2. If the internal heat of the earth is owing to the action of water upon mineral substances, that action through time must have ceased, and the heat have totally vanished; but we have no reason to think that the heat of the earth is anything less just now than it was a thousand years ago. If heat is nothing else than a certain mode of action in the ethereal fluid, or the matter of light, by which it flows out from a body in all directions as radii drawn from the centre to the circumference of a circle; it will then follow, that if an opaque body absorbs any considerable quantity of light, it must necessarily grow hot. The reason of this is plain. The body can hold no more than a certain quantity of ethereal matter; if more is continually forcing itself in, that which has already entered must go out. But it cannot easily get out, because it is hindered by the particles of the body among which it is detained. It makes an effort therefore in all directions to separate these particles from each other; and hence the body expands, and the effort of the fluid to escape is felt when we put our hands on the body, which we then say is hot. Now, as the earth is perpetually absorbing the ethereal matter, which comes from the sun in an immense stream, and which we call his light, it is plain that every pore of it must have been filled with this matter long ago. The quantity that is lodged in the earth, therefore, must be continually endeavouring to separate its particles from each other, and consequently must make it hot. The atmosphere, which is perpetually receiving that portion of the ethereal matter which issues from the earth, counteracts the force of the internal heat, and cools the external surface of the earth, and for a considerable way down; and hence, it is supposed, the earth for 20 or 30 feet down shows none of that heat which is felt at greater depths. See Heat.\n\n**Heat, in Medicine.** Great heats are not so much the immediate, as the remote, cause of a general sickness, by relaxing the fibres, and disposing the juices to putrefaction; especially among soldiers and persons exposed the whole day to the sun: for the greatest heats are seldom found to produce epidemic diseases, till the perspiration is stopped by wet clothes, fogs, dews, damps, &c., and then some bilious or putrid distemper is the certain consequence, as fluxes and ardent intermittent fevers. Nevertheless, it must be allowed, that heats have sometimes been so great as to prove the more immediate cause of particular disorders; as when...\nHEATH\n\nHEATH, James, an English historian, was born in 1629 at London; where his father, who was the king's cutler, lived. He was educated at Westminster school, and became a student of Christ-church, Oxford, in 1646. In 1648 he was ejected from thence by the parliament victors for his adherence to the royal cause; lived upon his patrimony till it was almost spent; and then marrying, was obliged to write books and correct the press in order to maintain his family. He died of a consumption and dropsy at London in August 1664, and left several children to the parish.\n\nHis principal publications were, 1. A brief Chronicle of the late Interregnum War in the Three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, &c., 1661, 8vo; afterwards enlarged by the author, and completed from 1637 to 1663, in four parts, 1663, in a thick 8vo. To this was again added a continuation from 1663 to 1675 by John Philips, nephew by the mother to Milton, 1676, folio. 2. Flagellum; or, The Life and Death, Birth and Burial, of Oliver Cromwell, the late Usurper, 1663. The third edition came out with additions in 1665, 8vo. 3. A New Book of Loyal English Martyrs and Confessors, who have endured the Pains and Terrors of Death, Arraignment, &c., for the Maintenance of the just and legal Government of these Kingdoms both in Church and State, 1663, 12mo. The reason why such writers as our author continue to be read, and will probably always be read, is not only because Historia quaequo modo scripta deletat; but also because in the meanest historian there will always be found some facts, of which there will be no cause to doubt the truth, and which yet will not be found in the best. Thus Heath, who perhaps had nothing but pamphlets and newspapers to compile from, frequently relates facts that throw light upon the history of those times, which Clarendon, though he drew every thing from the most authentic records, has omitted.\n\nHEATHENS, in matters of religion. See PAGANS.\n\nHEAVEN, literally signifies the expanse of the firmament, surrounding our earth, and extended every way to an immense distance.\n\nHEAVEN, among Christian divines and philosophers, is considered as a place in some remote part of infinite space, in which the omnipresent Deity is said to afford a nearer and more immediate view of himself, and a more sensible manifestation of his glory, than in the other parts of the universe. This is often called the empyrean, from that splendour with which it is supposed to be invested; and of this place the inspired writers give us the most noble and magnificent descriptions.\n\nThe Pagans considered heaven as the residence only of the celestial gods, into which no mortals were admitted after death, unless they were deified. As for the souls of good men, they were consigned to the elysian fields. See Elysian Fields.\n\nHEAVEN, among astronomers, called also the ethereal and starry heaven, is that immense region wherein the stars, planets, and comets, are disposed. See Astronomy Index.\n\nThis is what Moses calls the firmament, speaking of it as the work of the second day's creation; at least it is thus the word יָרְאֵי is usually rendered by his interpreters; though somewhat abusively, to countenance their own notion of the heavens being firm or solid. The word, it is certain, properly signifies no more than expansion or extension; a term very well adapted by the prophet to the impression which the heavens make on our senses; whence, in other parts of scripture, the heaven is compared to a curtain, or a tent stretched out to dwell in. The LXX first added to this idea of expansion that of firm or solid; rendering it by στεγάσμα, according to the philosophy of those times; in which they have been followed by the modern translators.\n\nThe latter philosophers, as Descartes, Kircher, &c., have easily demonstrated this heaven not to be solid, but fluid; but they still suppose it full, or perfectly dense, without any vacuity, and cantoned out into many vortices.—But others have overturned not only the solidity, but the supposed plentitude, of the heavens. Sir Isaac Newton has abundantly shown the heavens void of almost all resistance, and, consequently, of almost all matter; this he proves from the phenomena of the celestial bodies; from the planets revolving in their motions without any sensible diminution of their velocity; and the comets freely passing in all directions towards all parts of the heavens.\n\nHeaven, taken in a general sense, for the whole expanse between our earth and the remotest regions of the fixed stars, may be divided into two very unequal parts, according to the matter found therein; viz. the atmosphere, or aerial heaven, posited by air; and the ethereal heaven, posited by a thin, unresisting medium, called ether.\n\nHEAVEN is more particularly used, in Astronomy, for an orb, or circular region, of the ethereal heaven.\n\nThe ancient astronomers assumed as many different heavens as they observed different motions therein. These they supposed all to be solid, as thinking they could not otherwise sustain the bodies fixed in them; and spherical, that being the most proper form for motion. Thus we had seven heavens for the seven planets, viz. the heavens of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars,\nHEBDOMADARY, HERDOMADARIUS, or HERDOMADIUS, a member of a chapter or convent, whose week it is to officiate in the choir, to rehearse the anthems and prayers, and to perform the usual functions which the superiors perform at solemn feasts, and other extraordinary occasions. The word is formed of the Greek ἑβδομήκης, which signifies the number seven; of ἑπτά, seven.\n\nThe hebdomadary generally collates to the benefices which become vacant during his week; though it is usually looked upon as an abuse.\n\nIn cathedrals, the hebdomadary was a canon or prebendary, who had the peculiar care of the choir, and the inspection of the officers for his week.\n\nIn monasteries, the hebdomadary is he who waits at table for a week, or other stated period; directs and assists the cook, &c.\n\nHEBDOME, a solemnity of the ancient Greeks, in honour of Apollo, in which the Athenians sung hymns to his praise, and carried in their hands branches of laurel. The word signifies the seventh day, this solemnity being observed on the seventh day of every lunar month.\n\nHEBE, in ancient mythology, a goddess, the idea of whom, among the Romans, seems to have been much the same with that of eternal youth, or an immortality of bliss; agreeably to which, she is represented on a gem, in the great duke's collection at Florence, with a young airy look, and drinking out of a little bowl; or, according to Milton's expression, \"Quaffing immortality and joy.\" She is fabled to have been a daughter of Jupiter and Juno. According to some she was the daughter of Juno only, who conceived her after eating lettuces. As she was fair and always in the bloom of youth, she was called the goddess of youth, and made by her mother cup-bearer to all the gods. She was dismissed from her office by Jupiter, because she fell down in an indecent posture as she was pouring nectar to the gods at a grand festival; and Ganymedes, the favourite of Jupiter, succeeded her as cup-bearer. She was employed by her mother to prepare her chariot, and to harness her peacocks whenever requisite. When Hercules was raised to the rank of a god, he was reconciled to Juno by marrying her daughter Hebe, by whom he had two sons, Alexiares and Anicetus. As Hebe had the power of restoring gods and men to the vigour of youth, she, at the instance of her husband, performed that kind office to Iolaus his friend. Hebe was worshipped at Sicyon, under the name of Dia, and Hebenstreata Rome under that of Juventas.\n\nHEBENSTRÉTIA, a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 48th order, Aggregate. See Botany Index.\n\nHEBER, the son of Salah, and father of Peleg, from whom the Hebrews derived their name, according to Josephus, Eusebius, Jerome, Bede, and most of the interpreters of the sacred writings; but Huet bishop of Avranches, in his Evangelical Demonstration, has attempted to prove, that the Hebrews took their name from the word heber, which signifies beyond, because they came from beyond the Euphrates. Heber is supposed to have been born 2281 years B.C. and to have lived 464 years.\n\nHEBRAISM, an idiom, or manner of speaking, peculiar to the Hebrew language. See the next article.\n\nHEBREW, something relating to the Hebrew. See HEBREWS. Thus we say, Hebrew Bible. See BIBLE.\n\nHebrew Character. There are two kinds of Hebrew characters: the ancient, called also the square; and the modern, or rabbinical character.\n\n1. The square Hebrew takes its denomination from the figure of its characters, which stand more square, and have their angles more exact and precise than the other. This character is used in the text of Holy Scripture, and their other principal and most important writings. When both this and the rabbinical character are used in the same work, the former is for the text, or the fundamental part; and the latter for the accessory part, as the glosses, notes, commentaries, &c.\n\nThe best and most beautiful characters of this kind, are those copied from the characters in the Spanish manuscripts; next, those from the Italian manuscripts; then those from the French; and lastly, those of the Germans, whose characters are much the same, with respect to the other genuine square Hebrew characters, that the Gothic or Dutch characters are with respect to the Roman.\n\nSeveral authors contend, that the square character is not the real ancient Hebrew character, written from the beginning of the language to the time of the Babylonish captivity; but that it is the Assyrian or Chaldee character, which the Jews assumed, and accustomed themselves to, during the captivity, and retained afterwards. They say, that the Jews, during their captivity, had quite disused their ancient character; so that Ezra found it necessary to have the sacred books transcribed into the Chaldean square character. These authors add, that what we call the Samaritan character, is the genuine ancient Hebrew. Of this opinion are Scaliger, Bochart, Cauaibon, Wolfius, Grotius, Walton, Capellus, &c. and among the ancients Jerome and Eusebius. On this side it is urged, that the present characters are called Assyrian by the ancient Jewish writers of the Talmud, and therefore must have been brought from Assyria; but to this argument it is replied, that there were two sorts of characters anciently in use, viz. the sacred or present square character, and the profane or civil, which we call Samaritan; and that the sacred is called Assyrian, because it first began in Assyria to come into common use. It is farther al-\nHebrew. leged, that the Chaldee letters, which the Jews now use, were unknown to the ancient Jews before the captivity, from Dan. i. 4. Moreover, it is inferred from 2 Kings xvii. 28, whence we learn that a Jewish priest was sent to teach the Samaritans the worship of Jehovah; on which occasion he must have taught them the law; and yet no mention occurs of his teaching them the language or character that the law was then written in, the character which the Samaritans used. But the chief argument is taken from some ancient Jewish shekels, with a legend on one side \"The shekel of Israel,\" and on the other \"Jerusalem the holy,\" both in Samaritan characters. These shekels, it is said, must have been coined before the division of the two kingdoms of Judah and Israel, or at least before the Assyrian captivity, because the Samaritans never afterwards reckoned Jerusalem holy. On the other side, or for the primitive antiquity of the square character, are the two Buxtorfs, Leufden, Calvius, Hottinger, Spanheim, Lightfoot, &c. They urge, from Matthew v. 18, that jod is really the last of the consonants in the present Hebrew, whereas it is one of the largest characters in the Samaritan alphabet; but Walton replies, that if our Saviour here speaks of the last letter of the alphabet, we can only infer, that the Chaldee character was used in our Saviour's time, which is not denied by those who maintain the Samaritan to be the original. They also allege, that the Jews were too obstinate and superstitious to allow their sacred character to be altered; but if this was done under the direction and authority of Ezra, the argument will be much invalidated. Further, they say, that Ezra could not alter the ancient character, because it was impossible to make the alterations in all their copies. This argument, however, is contradicted by fact; since the old English black letter is actually changed for the Roman. They say, likewise, that Ezra was not disposed to profane the sacred writings with a heathen character; but this supposes that Ezra was so superstitious as to imagine, that there was some peculiar sanctity in the shape of the letters. Moreover, the advocates for this opinion appeal to ancient coins found in Judaea, with a legend in the Chaldee or Assyrian character. But the genuineness of these coins is much suspected.\n\nThe learned Jesuit Societ maintains, with great address, that the ancient Hebrew character is that found on the medals of Simon, and others, commonly called Samaritan medals; but which, he affirms, were really Hebrew medals, struck by the Jews, and not the Samaritans.\n\nBuxtorf endeavours to reconcile these two opinions, by producing a variety of passages from the rabbies to prove, that both these characters were anciently used; the present square character being that in which the tables of the law, and the copy deposited in the ark, were written; and the other character being used in the copies of the law which were written for private and common use, and in civil affairs in general; and that after the captivity, Ezra enjoined the former to be used by the Jews on all occasions, leaving the latter to the Samaritans and apostates. But it can hardly be allowed by any who consider the difference between the Chaldee and Samaritan characters, with respect to convenience and beauty, that they were ever used at the same time. After all, it is of no great moment which of these, or whether either of them, were the original characters; since it appears, that no change of the words has arisen from the manner of writing them, because the Samaritan and Jewish Pentateuch almost always agree after so many ages. It is most probable that the form of these characters has varied in different periods; this appears from the testimony of Montfaucon, in his Hexapla Origenis, vol. i. p. 22, &c. and is implied in Dr Kennicot's making the characters in which manuscripts are written one test of their age.\n\n2. The modern, or rabbinical, is a good neat character, formed of the square Hebrew, by rounding it, and retrenching most of the angles or corners of the letters, to make it the more easy and flowing. The letters used by the Germans are very different from the rabbinical character used everywhere else, though all formed alike from the square character, by the German in a more flowery manner than the rest.—The rabbins frequently make use either of their own, or the square Hebrew character, to write the modern languages in. There are even books in the vulgar tongues printed in Hebrew characters; instances whereof are seen in the French king's library.\n\nHebrew Language, that spoken by the Hebrews, and wherein the Old Testament is written.\n\nThis appears to be the most ancient of all the languages in the world, at least we know of none older; and some learned men are of opinion, that this is the language in which God spoke to Adam in Paradise. Dr Sharpe adopts the opinion that the Hebrew was the original language; not indeed that the Hebrew is the unvaried language of our first parents, but that it was the general language of men at the dispersion; and however it might have been improved and altered from the first speech of our first parents, it was the original of all the languages, or almost all the languages, or rather dialects, that have since arisen in the world.\n\nThe books of the Old Testament are the only pieces to be found, in all antiquity, written in pure Hebrew; and the language of many of these is extremely sublime: it appears perfectly regular, and particularly so in its conjugations. Indeed, properly speaking, it has but one conjugation; but this is varied in each seven or eight different ways, which has the effect of so many different conjugations, and affords a great variety of expressions to represent by a single word the different modifications of a verb, and many ideas which in the modern and in many of the ancient and learned languages cannot be expressed without a periphrasis.\n\nThe primitive words, which are called roots, have seldom more than three letters or two syllables.\n\nIn this language there are 22 letters, only five of which are usually reckoned vowels, which are the same with ours, viz. a, e, i, o, u; but then each vowel is divided into two, a long and a short, the sound of the former being somewhat grave and long, and that of the latter short and acute: it must however be remarked, that the two last vowels have sounds that differ in other respects besides quantity and a greater or less elevation. To these 10 or 12 vowels may be added others, called semi-vowels, which serve to connect the consonants, and to make the easier transitions from one\nThe number of accents in this language is indeed prodigious; of these there are near 40, the use of some of which, notwithstanding all the inquiries of the learned, are not yet perfectly known. We know, in general, that they serve to distinguish the sentences like the points called commas, semicolons, &c., in our language; to determine the quantity of the syllables; and to mark the tone with which they are to be spoken or sung. It is no wonder, then, that there are more accents in the Hebrew than in other languages, since they perform the office of three different things, which in other languages are called by different names.\n\nAs we have no Hebrew but what is contained in the Scripture, that language to us wants a great many words; not only because in those primitive times the languages were not so copious as at present; but also on this account, that the inspired writers had no occasion to mention many of the terms that might be in the language.\n\nThe Chaldee, Syriac, Ethiopic, &c., languages, are by some held to be only dialects of the Hebrew; as the French, Italian, Spanish, &c., are dialects of the Latin. It has been supposed by many very learned men, that the Hebrew characters or letters were often used hieroglyphically, and that each had its several distinct sense understood as a hieroglyphic. Neuman, who seems to have taken infinite pains to find out this secret meaning of these letters, gives the following explication: א aleph, he says, is a character denoting motion, readiness, and activity; ב beth, signifies, 1. Matter, body, substance, thing; 2. Place, space, or capacity; and, 3. In, within, or contained; ג gimel, stands for flexion, bending, or obliquity of any kind; ד daleth, signifies any protrusion made from without, or any promotion of any kind; ה he, stands for presence, or demonstrative essence of any thing; ו vau, stands for copulation or growing together of things; ז zain, expresses vehement protrusion and violent compression, such as is occasioned by at once violently discharging and confining a thing together; it also signifies sometimes the thinning of any figure into a narrow point at the end; ח cheth, expresses association, society, or any kind of composition or combination of things together; ט teth, stands for the withdrawing, drawing back, or receding of any thing; י yod, signifies extension and length, whether in matter or in time; כ caph, expresses a turning, curvedness, or concavity; ל lamedh, stands for an addition, access, impulse, or advervation, and sometimes for pressure; מ mem, expresses amplitude, or the amplifying anything in whatever sense; in regard to contiguous qualities, it signifies the adding length, breadth, and circumference; and in disjunct qualities it signifies multitude; נ nun, signifies the propagation of one thing from another, or of the same thing from one person to another; ס samech, expresses cincture and coarctation; פ pe, stands for observation, objection, or obviation; צ tsade, expresses crookedness or an angle of any figure; ק koph, expresses contiguity and close succession; ר resh, expresses a circuit or ambit; ש shin, expresses the edges of any thing, as also the exterior part of a thing, and the extremity or end of any thing; ת teth, signifies the number three, or the third degree, or the utmost perfection of any thing; א aleph, expresses a sequel, continuation, or succession of any Hebrew thing.\n\nAccording to this explication, as the several particular letters of the Hebrew alphabet separately signify the ideas of motion, matter, space, and several modifications of matter, space, and motion, it follows that a language, the words of which are composed of such expressive characters, must necessarily be of all languages the most perfect and expressive, as the words formed of such letters, according to their determinate separate significations, must convey the idea of all the matters contained in the sense of the several characters, and be at once a name and a definition, or succinct description of the subject, and all things material as well as spiritual, all objects in the natural and moral world, must be known as soon as their names are known, and their separate letters considered.\n\nThe words urim and thummim are thus easily explained, and found perhaps the most apposite and expressive words that were ever formed.\n\nRabbinical or modern Hebrew, is the language used by the rabbins in the writings they have composed. The basis or body thereof is the Hebrew and Chaldee, with divers alterations in the words of these two languages, the meanings whereof they have considerably enlarged and extended. Abundance of things they have borrowed from the Arabic; the rest is chiefly composed of words and expressions, chiefly from the Greek; some from the Latin; and others from the other modern tongues; particularly that spoken in the place where each rabbin lived or wrote.\n\nThe rabbinical Hebrew must be allowed to be a very copious language. M. Simon, in his Hift. Crit. du Vieux Testament, liv. iii. chap. 27, observes, that there is scarce any art or science but the rabbins have treated thereof in it. They have translated most of the ancient philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, and physicians; and have written themselves on most subjects; they do not want even orators and poets. Add, that this language, notwithstanding it is so crowded with foreign words, has its beauties visible enough in the works of those who have written well in it.\n\nHEBREWS, the descendants of Heber, commonly called Jews. See Hebrew and Jews.\n\nHEBREWS, or Epistle to the Hebrews, a canonical book of the New Testament.\n\nThough St Paul did not prefix his name to this epistle, the concurrent testimony of the best authors ancient and modern afford such evidence of his being the author of it, that the objections to the contrary are of little or no weight.\n\nThe Hebrews, to whom this epistle was written, were the believing Jews of Palestine; and its design was to convince them, and by their means all the Jewish converts whereverover dispersed, of the insufficiency and abolishment of the ceremonial and ritual law.\n\nHEBRIDES, the general name of some islands lying to the north-west of Scotland, of which kingdom they constitute a part. They are situated between the 55th and 59th degrees of latitude, are supposed to be about 300 in number, and to contain 48,000 inhabitants. The names of the largest are Lewis, Sky, Mull, Ilay, and Arran. Of these islands Mr Pennant hath given the following history.\n\n\"All the accounts left us by the Greek and Roman writers...\"\nHebrides writers are enveloped with obscurity; at all times brief even in their descriptions of places they had easiest access to, and might have described with the most satisfactory precision; but in remote places, their relations furnish little more than hints, the food for conjecture to the visionary antiquary.\n\n\"That Pytheas, a traveller mentioned by Strabo, had visited Great Britain, I would wish to make only apocryphal. He affirms that he visited the remoter parts; and that he had also seen Thule, the land of romance amongst the ancients; which all might pretend to have seen; but every voyager, to swell his fame, made the island he saw last the Ultima Thule of his travels. If Pytheas had reached these parts, he might have observed, floating in the seas, multitudes of gelatinous animals, the medusa of Linnaeus, and out of these he formed his fable. He made his Thule a composition of neither earth, sea, nor air; but like a composition of them all; then, catching his simile from what floated before him, compares it to the lungs of the sea, the Aristotelian idea of these bodies; and from him adopted by naturalists, succedors to that great philosopher. Strabo very justly explodes these absurd tales; yet allows him merit in describing the climate of the places he had seen. As a farther proof of his having visited the Hebrides, he mentions their unfriendly sky, that prohibits the growth of the finer fruits; and that the natives are obliged to carry their corn under shelter, to beat the grain out, lest it should be spoiled by the defect of sun and violence of the rains. This is the probable part of his narrative; but when the time that the great geographer wrote is considered, at a period that these islands had been neglected for a very long space by the Romans, and when the difficulties of getting among a fierce and unfriendly nation must be almost insuperable, doubts innumerable respecting the veracity of this relation must arise. All that can be admitted in favour of him is, that he was a great traveller; and that he might have either visited Britain from some of the nations commencing with our isle; or received from them accounts, which he afterwards dressed out, mixed with the ornaments of fable. A traffic must have been carried on with the very northern inhabitants of our islands in the time of Pytheas, for one of the articles of commerce mentioned by Strabo, the ivory bits, were made either of the teeth of the walrus, or of a species of whale native of the northern seas.\n\n\"The geographer Mela, who flourished in the reign of Claudius, is the next who takes notice of our lesser islands. He mentions the Orcades as consisting of 30; the Aemodae of seven. The Romans had then made a conquest of the former, and might have seen the latter; but, from the words of the historian, it is probable that the Shetland islands were those intended; for he informs us, that the \"Aemodae were carried out over against Germany;\" the site of the Hebrides will not admit this description, which agrees very well with the others; for the ancients extended their Germany, and its imaginary islands, to the extreme north.\n\n\"Pliny the Elder is the next that mentions these remote places. He lived later than the preceding writers, and of course his information is fuller; by means of intervening discoveries, he has added ten more to the number of the Orcades; is the first writer that mentions the Hoebudes, the islands in question; and joins in the Hebrides. The same line Aemodae, or, as it is in the best editions more properly written, the Aemodie, or extreme point of the Roman expeditions to the north, as the Shetland isles in the highest probability were. Pliny and Mela agree in the number of the Aemodae, or Aemodae; the former makes that of the Hoebudes 30; an account extremely near the truth, deducing the little isles, or rather rocks, that surround most of the greater, and many of them to indistinct as scarcely to be remarked, except on an actual survey.\n\n\"Solinus succeeds Pliny. If he, as is supposed, was contemporary with Agricola, he has made very ill use of the light he might have received from the expeditions of that great general; his officers might have furnished the historian with better materials than those he has communicated. He has reduced the number of the Hoebudes to five. He tells us, that \"the inhabitants were unacquainted with corn: that they lived only on fish and milk; that they had one king, as the islands were only separated from each other by narrow straits; that their prince was bound by certain rules of government to do justice: and was prevented by poverty from deviating from the true course, being supported by the public, and allowed nothing that he could call his own, not even a wife; but then he was allowed free choice, by turns one out of every district, of any female that caught his affection; which deprived him of all ambition about a successor.\n\n\"By the number of these islands, and by the minute attention given by the historian to the circumstance of their being separated from each other by very narrow straits, I should imagine, that which is now called the Long Island, and includes Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, and Barra, to have been the five Hoebudes of Solinus; for the other great islands, such as Sky, &c., are too remote from each other to form the preceding very characteristic description of that chain of islands. These might naturally fall under the rule of one petty prince; almost the only probable part of Solinus's narrative.\n\n\"After a long interval appears Ptolemy, the Egyptian geographer. He also enumerates five Ebudei; and has given each a name; the Western Ebuda, the Eastern, Regina, Maleos, Epidium. Camden conjectures them to be the modern Sky, Lewis, Rathay or Racline, Mull, and Hay; and I will not controvert his opinion.\n\n\"The Roman historians give very little light into the geography of these parts. Tacitus, from whom most might have been expected, is quite silent about the names of places; notwithstanding he informs us, that a fleet by the command of Agricola performed the circumnavigation of Britain. All that he takes notice of is the discovery and the conquest of the Orkneys: it should seem, that with the biographers of an ambitious nation, nothing seemed worthy of notice but what they could dignify with the glory of victory.\n\n\"It is very difficult to assign a reason for the change of name from Ebudei to Hebridei; the last is modern; and seems, as the annotator on Dr Macpherston supposes, to have arisen from the error of a transcriber, who changed the u into rh.\"\nFrom all that has been collected from the ancients, it appears, that they were acquainted with little more of the Hebrides than the bare names: it is probable, that the Romans, either from contempt of such barren spots, from the dangers of the seas, the violence of the tides, and horrors of the narrow sounds, in the inexperienced ages of navigation, never attempted their conquest, or saw more of them than what they had in sight during the few circumnavigations of Great Britain, which were expeditions more of ostentation than of utility.\n\nThe inhabitants had probably for some ages their own governors, one little king to each island, or to each group, as necessity required. It is reasonable to suppose, that their government was as much divided as that of Great Britain, which, it is well known, was under the direction of numbers of petty princes before it was reduced under the power of the Romans.\n\nNo account is given in history of the time these islands were annexed to the government of Scotland. If we may credit our Saxon historians, they appear to have been early under the dominion of the Picts; for Bede and Adamnanus inform us, that soon after the arrival of St Columba in their country, Brude, a Pictish monarch, made the first present of the celebrated island of Iona. But neither the holy men of this island, nor the natives of the rest of the Hebrides, enjoyed a permanent repose after this event. The first invasion of the Danes does not seem to be easily ascertained. It appears that they ravaged Ireland, and the isle of Rathery, as early as the year 735. In the following century, their expeditions became more frequent: Harold Harfager, or the light-haired, pursued, in 875, several petty princes, whom he had expelled out of Norway; who had taken refuge in the Hebrides, and molested his dominions by perpetual descents from those islands. He seems to have made a rapid conquest: he gained as many victories as he fought battles; he put to death the chief of the pirates, and made an indiscriminate slaughter of their followers. Soon after his return, the islanders repopulated their ancient seats; and, in order to repress their insults, he sent Ketil the flat-nosed with a fleet and some forces for that purpose. He soon reduced them to terms, but made his victories subservient to his own ambition; he made alliances with the reguli he had subdued; he formed intermarriages, and confirmed to them their old dominions. This effected, he sent back the fleet to Harold; openly declared himself independent; made himself prince of the Hebrides; and caused them to acknowledge him as such, by the payment of tribute and the badges of vassalage. Ketil remained, during life, master of the islands; and his subjects appear to have been a warlike set of freebooters, ready to join with any adventurers. Thus when Eric, son of Harold Harfager, after being driven out of his own country, made an invasion of England, he put with his fleet into the Hebrides, received a large reinforcement of people fired with the hopes of prey, and then proceeded on his plan of rapine. After the death of Ketil, a kingdom was in after times composed out of them, which from the residence of the little monarch in the isle of Man, was styled that of Man.\n\nThe islands became tributary to that of Norway for a considerable time, and princes were sent from thence to govern; but at length they again shook off the yoke. Whether the little potentates ruled independent, or whether they put themselves under the protection of the Scottish monarchs, does not clearly appear; but it is reasonable to suppose the last, as Donald-bane is accused of making the Hebrides the price of the assistance given him by the Norwegians against his own subjects. Notwithstanding they might occasionally seek the protection of Scotland, yet they never were without princes of their own: policy alone directed them to the former. From the chronicles of the kings of Man we learn, that they had a succession of princes.\n\nIn 1089 is an evident proof of the independency of the islanders on Norway; for, on the death of Lagman, one of their monarchs, they sent a deputation to O'Brien king of Ireland, to request a regent of royal blood to govern them during the minority of their young prince. They probably might in turn compliment in some other respects their Scottish neighbours; the islanders must have given them some pretence to sovereignty; for,\n\nIn 1093, Donald-bane, king of Scotland, calls in the assistance of Magnus the Barefooted, king of Norway, and bribes him with the promise of all the islands. Magnus accepts the terms; but at the same time boasts, that he does not come to invade the territories of others, but only to resume the ancient rights of Norway. His conquests are rapid and complete; for, besides the islands, by an ingenious fraud he adds Cantyre to his dominions.\n\nThe Hebrides continued governed by a prince dependent on Norway, a species of viceroy appointed by that court; and who paid, on assuming the dignity, ten marks of gold, and never made any other pecuniary acknowledgment during life: but if another viceroy was appointed, the same sum was exacted from him. These viceroys were sometimes Norwegians, sometimes natives of the isles. In 1097 we find, that Magnus deputes a nobleman of the name of Ingemund: in after times we learn, that natives were appointed to that high office. Thus were the Hebrides governed, from the conquest by Magnus, till the year 1263, when Acho, or Haquin, king of Norway, by an unfortunate invasion of Scotland, terminating in his defeat at Largs, so weakened the powers of his kingdom, that his successor Magnus IV. was content to make a cession of the islands to Alexander III.; but not without stipulating for the payment of a large sum, and a tribute of 100 merks for ever, which bore the name of the annual of Norway. Ample provision was also made by Magnus in the same treaty, for the security of the rights and properties of his Norwegian subjects who chose to continue in the isles, where many of their posterity remain to this day.\n\nNotwithstanding this revolution, Scotland seems to have received no real acquisition of strength. The islands still remained governed by powerful chieftains, the descendants of Somerled, thane of Heregaidel, or Argyle, who, marrying the daughter of Olave, king of Man, left a divided dominion to his sons Du gal and Reginald: from the first were defended the Macdougals.\nHebrides. Macdougals of Lorn; from the last, the powerful clan of the Macdonalds. The lordship of Argyle, with Mull, and the islands north of it, fell to the share of the first; Ilay, Cantyre, and the southern isles, were the portion of the last: a division that formed the distinction of the Sudereys and Nordereys, (as further noticed in the article IONA).\n\nThese chieftains were the scourges of the kingdom: they are known in history but as the devastations of a tempest; for their paths were marked with the most barbarous desolation. Encouraged by their distance from the seat of royalty, and the turbulence of the times, which gave their monarchs full employment, they exercised a regal power, and often assumed the title; but are more generally known in history by the style of the lords of the isles, or the earls of Rothes; and sometimes by that of the Great Macdonald.\n\nHistorians are silent about their proceedings, from the retreat of the Danes, in 1263, till that of 1335, when John, lord of the isles, withdrew his allegiance. In the beginning of the next century his successors were so independent, that Henry IV. entered into a formal alliance with the brothers Donald and John. This encouraged them to commit fresh hostilities against their natural prince. Donald, under pretence of a claim to the earldom of Rothes, invaded and made a conquest of that county: but penetrating as far as the shire of Aberdeen, after a fierce but undecisive battle with the royal party, thought proper to retire, and in a little time to swear allegiance to his monarch James I. But he was permitted to retain the county of Rothes, and assume the title of earl. His successor, Alexander, at the head of 10,000 men, attacked and burnt Inverness; at length terrified with the preparations made against him, he fell at the royal feet, and obtained pardon as to life, but was committed to strict confinement.\n\nHis kinsman and deputy, Donald Balloch, resenting the imprisonment of his chieftain, excited another rebellion, and destroyed the country with fire and sword; but on his flight was taken and put to death by an Irish chieftain, with whom he fought protection.\n\nThese barbarous inroads were very frequent with a set of banditti, who had no other motive in war but the infamous inducement of plunder.\n\nIn the reign of James II. in the year 1461, Donald, another petty tyrant, an earl of Rothes, and lord of the isles, renewed the pretence of independence; surprized the cattle of Inverness; forced his way as far as Athol; and obliged the earl and countess, with the principal inhabitants, to seek refuge in the church of St Bridget, in hopes of finding security from his cruelty by the sanctity of the place: but the barbarian and his followers set fire to the church, put the ecclesiastics to the sword, and, with a great booty, carried the earl and countess prisoners to his castle of Clraig, in the island of Ilay. In a second expedition, immediately following the first, he suffered the penalty of his impiety: a tempest overtook him, and overwhelmed most of his associates; and he, escaping to Inverness, perished by the hands of an Irish harper; his surviving followers returned to Ilay, conveyed the earl and countess of Athol to the sanctuary they had violated, and expiated their crime by restoring the Hebrides, plunder, and making large donations to the shrine of the offended saint.\n\nJohn, successor to the last earl of Rothes, entered into alliance with Edward IV. and sent ambassadors to the court of England, where Edward empowered the bishop of Durham and earl of Winchester to conclude a treaty with him, another Donald Balloch, and his son and heir John. They agreed to serve the king with all their power, and to become his subjects: the earl was to have 100 marks sterling for life in time of peace, and 200l. in time of war; and these island allies, in case of the conquest of Scotland, were to have confirmed to them all the possessions borne of the Scottish sea; and in case of a truce with the Scottish monarch, they were to be included in it. But about the year 1476, Edward, from a change of politics, courted the alliance of James III. and dropt his new allies. James, determined to subdue this rebellious race, sent against them a powerful army under the earl of Athol; and took leave of him with this good wish, Firth, Fortune, and fill the fetters; as much as to say, \"Go forth, be fortunate, and bring home many captives;\" which the family of Athol has used ever since for its motto. Rothes was terrified into submission; obtained his pardon; but was deprived of his earldom, which by act of parliament was then declared unalienably annexed to the crown: at the same time the king restored to him Knapdale and Cantyre, which the earl had resigned; and invested him anew with the lordship of the isles, to hold them of the king by service and relief.\n\nThus the great power of the isles was broken: yet for a considerable time after, the petty chieftains were continually breaking out into small rebellions, or harafted each other in private wars; and tyranny seems but to have been multiplied. James V. found it necessary to make the voyage of the isles in person in 1536, seized and brought away with him several of the most considerable leaders, and obliged them to find security for their own good behaviour and that of their vassals. The names of these chieftains were (according to Lindeley), Muddyart, Macconnell, Macloyd, of the Lewis; Macnial, Maclane, Macintosh, John Muddyart, MacKay, MacKenzie, and many others; but by the names of some of the above, there seem to have been continental as well as insular malecontents. He examined the titles of their holdings; and finding several to have been usurped, reunited their lands to the crown. In the same voyage he had the glory of causing a survey to be taken of the coasts of Scotland, and of the islands, by his pilot Alexander Lindeley; which were published in 1583, at Paris, by Nicholas de Nicolay, geographer to the French monarch.\n\nThe troubles that succeeded the death of James occasioned a neglect of these insulated parts of the Scottish dominions, and left them in a state of anarchy. In 1614, the Macdonalds made a formidable insurrection, oppugning the royal grant of Cantyre to the earl of Argyle and his relations. The petty chieftains continued in a fort of rebellion; and the sword of the greater, as usual in weak governments, was employed against them: the encouragement and protection given by them to pirates, employed the power of the Campbells\nbells during the reign of James VI, and the beginning of that of Charles I. (A).\n\n\"But the turbulent spirit of the old times continued even to the present age. The heads of clans were by the divisions, and a false policy that predominated in Scotland during the reign of William III. flattered with an ideal importance: instead of being treated as bad subjects, they were courted as desirable allies: instead of feeling the hand of power, money was allowed to bribe them into the loyalty of the times. They would have accepted the subsidies, notwithstanding they detested the prince that offered them. They were taught to believe themselves of such consequence, that in these days turned to their destruction. Two recent rebellions gave legislature a late experience of the folly of permitting the feudal system to exist in any part of its dominions. The act of 1748, for abolishing heritable jurisdictions, at once deprived the chieftains of all power of injuring the public by their combinations. Many of these Reguli second this effort of legislature, and neglect no opportunity of rendering themselves hateful to their unhappy vassals, the former instruments of their ambition.\"\n\n\"The situation of these islands in the great Atlantic ocean renders the air cold and moist in the greater part of them. In the most northerly isles the sun, at the summer solstice, is not above an hour under the horizon at midnight, and not longer above it at midday in the depth of winter. The soil of the Hebrides varies also in different isles, and in different parts of the same island: some are mountainous and barren, producing little else than heath, wild myrtle, fern, and a little grass; while others, being cultivated and manured with sea-weed, yield plentiful crops of oats and barley.\n\n\"Lead mines have been discovered in some of these islands, but not worked to much advantage; others have been found to contain quarries of marble, limestone, and freestone; nor are they destitute of iron, talc, crytals, and many curious pebbles, some of which emulate the Brazilian topaz.\n\n\"With respect to vegetables, over and above the plentiful harvests of corn that the natives earn from agriculture, and the pot-herbs and roots that are planted in gardens for the sustenance of the people, these islands produce spontaneously a variety of plants and simples, used by the islanders in the cure of their diseases; but there is hardly a shrub or tree to be seen, except in a very few spots, where some gentlemen have endeavoured to rear them with much more trouble than success.\n\n\"The animals, both of the land and sea, domestic and wild, quadrupeds, fowls, and fishes, found in and about these islands, are of the same species, size, and configuration, with those of the Orkneys.\n\n\"The people inhabiting these islands are of the same race with those who live in the Highlands of Scotland; speak the same language, wear the same habit, and observe the same customs. [See the article Highlands.]\n\n\"The commodities which may be deemed the staples of this country are black cattle, sheep, and fish, which they sell to their fellow-subjects of Scotland. Part of the wool they work up into knit-lockings, coarse cloth, and that variegated stuff called tartan. They likewise salt mutton in the hide, and export it in boats or barkings to different parts of the main land. Cod, ling, mackerel, whiting, haddock, and soles, are here caught in abundance, together with a small red cod, remarkably voracious, of a very delicate flavour: there are likewise two kinds of white fish, which seem to be peculiar to this coast, known by the names of lihe and cea, esteemed good eating. But the greatest treasure the ocean pours forth is the prodigious quantity of herrings, which, at one season of the year, swarm in all the creeks and bays along the western shore of Scotland. These are counted the largest, fattest, and finest herrings caught in any part of the northern seas. This fishery employs a great number of hands, and brings a considerable advantage to the kingdom. The fish are caught, cured, barrelled up, and exported: but whether from want of skill, or a proper salt for pickling, the Scotch-cured herrings of this coast, though superior to all others in their natural state, are counted inferior to those which are dressed and pickled by the Dutch fishermen.\n\n\"How mean and contracted forever the commerce and produce of these islands may be at present, they are perhaps more capable of improvement in both articles than any part of the British dominions in Europe. The inhabitants are so little skilled in husbandry, that the soil, though generally good in the low grounds, yields nothing but scanty crops of oats and barley; and great tracts of land lie altogether uncultivated. If a very small number of judicious farmers would settle in some of the most considerable islands, they would soon raise such harvests as would enrich themselves; employ and maintain all the idle people, a great number of whom are obliged to repair to foreign countries for subsistence; afford sufficient bread for the inhabitants, and even supply the barren parts of the opposite continent. The soil in many places would produce wheat, and almost everywhere would give good pasturage, inasmuch that, with proper culture, the people might provide hay and fodder for their cattle, which during the severity of the winter die in great numbers for want of provision. Improvements of this kind would be the more easily made, as the sea-shore abounds with shells for lime and sea-weeds for manure; and the labourers would be easily subsisted by the fish that swarm not only in the ocean which surrounds these islands, but likewise in the numerous lakes and rivers of fresh water. Martin declares, that he knew 100 families in this country maintained by as many little farms, the rent of each not exceeding 5s. one sheep, and a few pecks of oats.\n\n\"The commerce of these islands might be extended in such a manner as to render them a staple of trade, and an excellent nursery for seamen. They are furnished\n\n(A) In the beginning of the 17th century the islanders were continually harassing Ireland with their plundering invasions, or landing there to support rebellions: at length it was made treason to receive these Hebridean Redshanks as they were styled.\nHEBRIDES, nished with an infinite number of bays, creeks, and harbours, for the convenience of navigation: the inhabitants are numerous, strong, active, and every way qualified for the life of a mariner. The sea affords myriads of fish for exportation: the lands might afford plenty of pasturage for black cattle, horses, and sheep, as well as plenteous harvests of corn and other grain: woollen and linen manufactures might be prosecuted to great advantage, where labour is cheap and provisions are reasonable. The islands afford good stone and lime; and some parts of the opposite main land, timber for building. They have plenty of fuel, not only for the ordinary purposes of life, but also for salt-pans, which might be erected on different parts of the coast; and for burning sea-ware for the use of a glass or soap manufacture. Finally, the situation of these islands is so commodious for trade, that the navigator is immediately in the open sea, and almost in the neighbourhood of Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, Holland; nay, with a favourable wind, he can reach the coasts of France and Spain in a week's sailing: if he is bound for the British plantations, or indeed for any part of the known globe, he is at once disencumbered of the land, and prosecutes his voyage through the open sea without obstruction or difficulty.\n\nTo the neglected state of these islands, and to their great importance in various natural respects, the attention of government has been called within these few years by the representation and efforts of different patriotic noblemen and gentlemen, and a regular establishment has been formed under the name of the British Society for extending the Fisheries and improving the Sea-coasts of the Kingdom; in consequence of which many useful plans for the improvement of those islands have been adopted, and are gradually carrying into execution.\n\nNEW HEBRIDES, a cluster of islands lying in the Great South Sea, or Pacific ocean. The northern islands of this archipelago were first discovered by that great navigator Quiros in 1606, and not without reason considered as a part of the southern continent, which at that time, and till very lately, was supposed to exist. They were next visited by M. de Bougainville in 1768, who, besides landing on the island of Lepers, did no more than discover that the land was not connected, but composed of islands, which he called the Great Cyclades. Captain Cook, besides ascertaining the extent and situation of these islands, added the knowledge of several in this group which were before unknown. He explored the whole cluster; and thinking himself thereby entitled to affix to them a general appellation, he named them the New Hebrides. They are situated between latitudes of 14 deg. 25 min. and 20 deg. 4 min. south; and between 166 deg. 41 min. and 170 deg. 21 min. east longitude; and extend 125 leagues in the direction of north-north-west and south-south-east. The most northern part of this archipelago was called by M. de Bougainville the Peak of the Etoile. The whole cluster consists of the following islands; some of which have received names from the different European navigators; others retain the names which they bear among the natives. viz. Tierra del Espiritu Santo, Mallicollo, St Bartholomew, Isle of Lepers, Aurora, Whitsundays, Ambrym, Immer, Apee, Three Hills, Sandwich, Montagu, Hinchinbrook, Shepherd, Lorramanga, Iironan, Anna'ona, and Tanna.\n\nHEBRON, in Ancient Geography, a very ancient city situated in the hilly country of the tribe of Judah to the south. Its more ancient name was Kiriyath Arba, or Cariath Arba. In antiquity this city vied with most ancient cities of Egypt, being seven years prior to Zoan, translated Tanis by the Seventy. Josephus makes it not only older than Tanis, but even than Memphis. It stood to the west of the lake Alphalites, and was for some time the royal residence of David. After the captivity it fell into hands of the Edomites, as did all the south country of Judea. It is now called Habroun, situated seven leagues to the south of Bethlehem. The Arabs call it El-kallil, \"the well-beloved;\" which is the epithet they usually apply to Abraham, whose sepulchral grotto they still show. Habroun is seated at the foot of an eminence, on which are some wretched ruins, the maimed remains of an ancient castle. The adjacent country is a sort of oblong hollow, five or six leagues in length, and not disagreeably varied by rocky hillocks, groves of fir-trees, fluted oaks, and a few plantations of vines and olive trees. These vineyards are not cultivated with a view to make wine, the inhabitants being such zealous Mahometans as not to permit any Christians to live among them: they are only of use to procure dried raisins, which are badly prepared, though the grapes are of an excellent kind. The peasants cultivate cotton likewise, which is spun by their wives, and sold at Jerusalem and Gaza. They have also some soap manufactories, the kalli for which is sold them by the Bedouins; and a very ancient glass-house, the only one in Syria. They make there a great quantity of coloured rings, bracelets for the wrists and legs, and for the arms above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to Constantinople. In consequence of these manufactures, Mr Volney informs us, Habroun is the most powerful village in all this quarter; and is able to arm 800 or 900 men, who adhere to the faction Kaili, and are the perpetual enemies of the people of Bethlehem. This discord, which has prevailed throughout the country from the earliest times of the Arabs, causes a perpetual civil war. The peasants are incessantly making incursions on each other's lands, destroying their corn, dourra, falamum, and olive trees, and carrying off their sheep, goats, and camels. The Turks, who are everywhere negligent in preserving similar disorders, are the less attentive to them here, since their authority is very precarious. The Bedouins, whose camps occupy the level country, are continually at open hostilities with them; of which the peasants avail themselves to resist their authority, or do mischief to each other, according to the blind caprice of their ignorance or the interest of the moment. Hence arises anarchy which is still more dreadful than the depopulation which prevails elsewhere, while the mutual devastations of the contending parties render the appearance of this part of Syria more wretched than that of any other.\n\nHEBRUS, in Ancient Geography, the largest river of Thrace, rising from Mount Scambrus; running in two channels till it comes to Philippopolis, where they unite. It empties itself at two mouths into the Aegean sea, to the north of Samothrace. It was supposed to roll its waters upon golden sands. The head of Orphe-\nHECATE was thrown into it after it had been cut off by the Ciconian women.\n\nHECATE, in fabulous history, a daughter of Perseus and Afteria, the same as Proserpine or Diana. She was called Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and Hecate or Proserpine in hell; whence her name of Diva triformis, tergemina, triceps. She was supposed to preside over magic and enchantments. She was generally represented like a woman, with the head of a horse, a dog, or a boar; and sometimes she appeared with three different bodies, and three different faces, with one neck. Dogs, lambs, and honey, were generally offered to her, especially in ways and cross roads; whence she obtained the name of Trivia. Her power was extended over heaven, the earth, sea, and hell; and to her kings and nations supposed themselves indebted for their prosperity.\n\nHECATESIA, a yearly festival observed by the Stratonicensians in honour of Hecate. The Athenians paid also particular worship to this goddess, who was deemed the patroness of families and of children. From this circumstance the statues of the goddess were erected before the doors of the houses; and upon every new moon a public supper was always provided at the expense of the richest people, and set in the streets, where the poorest of the citizens were permitted to retire and feast upon it, while they reported that Hecate had devoured it. There were also expiatory offerings, to supplicate the goddess to remove whatever evils might impend on the head of the public, &c.\n\nHECATOMB, in antiquity, a sacrifice of a hundred beasts of the same kind, at a hundred altars, and by a hundred priests or sacrificers. The word is formed of the Greek ἱκέτης, which properly signifies a suppliant or magnificent sacrifice.—Other derives it from the Greek ἰκαρίον κέντρον, “a hundred,” and βοῦς, βοσ, “bullock,” &c.; on which footing the hecatomb should be a sacrifice of 100 bullocks.—Others derive the word from ἰκαρίον and περι, “foot,” and on that principle hold, that the hecatomb might consist of only 25 four-footed beasts. They add, that it did not matter what kind of beasts were chosen for victims, provided the quota of feet were but had.\n\nPythagoras is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb to the mules of 100 oxen, in joy and gratitude for his discovering the demonstration of the 47th proposition of the first book of Euclid, viz. that in a rectangle triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the two other sides.\n\nFor the origin of hecatombs: Strabo relates, that there were 100 cities in Laconia, and that each city used to sacrifice a bullock every year for the common safety of the country; whence the institution of the celebrated sacrifice of 100 victims, called hecatombs. Others refer the origin of hecatombs to a plague, wherewith the 100 cities of Peloponnesus were afflicted; for the removal whereof, they jointly contributed to so splendid a sacrifice.\n\nJulius Capitolinus relates, that for a hecatomb they erected 100 altars of turf, and on these sacrificed 100 sheep and 100 hogs. He adds, that when the emperors offered sacrifices of this kind, they sacrificed 100 lions, 100 eagles, and 100 other beasts of the like kind.\n\nHECATOMBÆON was the first month of the Athenian year, consisting of 30 days; beginning on the first new moon after the summer solstice, and consequently answering to the latter part of our June and the beginning of July. It had its name from the great number of hecatombs sacrificed in it. See HECATOMB.\n\nHECATOMPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, a surname of the island of Crete, from its 100 cities. The territory of Laconia also had anciently this name for the same reason; and the custom of these 100 cities was to sacrifice a hecatomb annually.\n\nHECATOPYLOS, in Ancient Geography, the metropolis of Parthia, and royal residence of Ariaces, situated at the springs of the Araxes. Thebes in Egypt had also the same name from its 100 gates.\n\nHECK, an engine to take fish. A salmon heck is a grate for catching that sort of fish.\n\nHECKLE, among hemp-dressers. See HATCHELL.\n\nHECLA, a volcano of Iceland, and one of the most furious in the world, situated in the southern part of the island. See ICELAND.\n\nIt was visited in the year 1772 by Dr Van Troil, a Swedish gentleman, along with Mr (now Sir Joseph) Banks, Dr Solander, and Dr James Lind of Edinburgh. On their first landing they found a tract of land 60 or 70 miles in extent entirely ruined by lava, which appeared to have been in the highest state of liquefaction. Having undertaken a journey to the top of the mountain, they travelled 300 or 360 English miles over an uninterrupted tract of lava; and had at length the pleasure of being the first who had arrived at the summit of the mountain.\n\nHecla, according to the accounts of these gentlemen, is situated in the southern part of the island, about four miles from the sea-coast, and is divided into three parts at the top, the middle point being the highest; and, according to an exact observation with Ramiden’s barometer, is 5000 feet above the level of the sea. They were obliged to quit their horses at the first opening from which the fire had burst. They describe this as a place with lofty glazed walls and high glazed cliffs, unlike any thing which they had ever seen before.\n\nA little higher up they found a large quantity of grit and stones; and still farther on another opening, which, though not deep, descended lower than that of the highest point. Here they imagined they plainly discerned the effects of boiling water; and not far from thence the mountain began to be covered with snow, excepting some spots which were bare. The reason of this difference they soon perceived to be the hot vapour ascending from the mountain. As they ascended higher they found these spots become larger; and about 200 yards below the summit, a hole about a yard and a half in diameter was observed, from whence issued a hot steam, that they could not measure the degree of heat with the thermometer. The cold now began to be very intense; Fahrenheit’s thermometer, which, at the foot of the mountain was at 54°, now fell to 24°; the wind also became so violent, that they were sometimes obliged to lie down for fear of being blown down the most dreadful precipices. On the very summit they experienced at the same time a high degree of heat and cold; for, in the air, Fahrenheit’s thermometer stood constantly at 24°, but when set on the ground, rose to 153°; the barometer stood at 22.247. Though they were\nwere very much inclined to remain here for some time, it could by no means be done with safety; for which reason they were obliged to descend very quickly.\n\nThe mountain seems to be made up, not of lava, but of sand, grit, and ashes; which are thrown up with the stones partly discoloured, and partly melted by the fire. Several sorts of pumice stones were found on it, among which was one with some sulphur. Sometimes the pumice was so much burnt, that it was as light as tow. Its form and colour was sometimes very fine, but at the same time so soft, that it was difficult to remove it from one place to another. The common lava was found both in large pieces and small bits; as likewise a quantity of black jasper burned at the extremities, and resembling trees and branches. Some flate of a strong red colour was observed among the stones thrown out by the volcano. In one place the lava had taken the form of chimney-flacks half broken down.—As they descended the mountain they observed three openings. In one, every thing looked as red as brick; from another, the lava had flowed in a stream about 50 yards broad, and after proceeding for some way, had divided into three large branches. Further on they perceived an opening, at the bottom of which was a mound in form of a sugar-loaf, in throwing up of which the fire appeared to have exhausted itself.\n\nWe have already observed, that our travellers were the first who ascended to the top of this mountain. The reason that no one before them had ever done so was partly founded in superstition, and partly the steepness and difficulty of the ascent, which was greatly facilitated by an irruption in 1766. Most kinds of lava found in other volcanic countries are to be met with about Hecla, or other Iceland volcanoes; as the gray, dark perforated kind, similar to the Derbyshire loadstone; the Iceland agate, *pumice vivus* both the niger and viridis. Some have conjectured this to be the *lapis ophidianus* of the ancients, which they formed into statues.\n\nThe lava is seldom found near the openings whence the eruptions proceed, but rather looie grit and ashes; and indeed the greater part of the Icelandic mountains consist of this matter; which, when it is grown cold, generally takes an arched form. The upper crust frequently grows hard and solid, whilst the melted matter beneath it continues liquid. This forms great cavities, whose walls, bed, and roof, are of lava, and where great quantities of flint-like lava are found. There are a vast number of these caves in the island, some of which are very large, and are made use of by the inhabitants for sheltering their cattle. The largest in the island is 524 feet long, and from 50 to 34 in breadth, and between 34 and 36 in height.—There are some prodigious clefts left by the eruptions, the largest of which is called *Almenegga*, near the water of Tingalla, in the south-western part of the island. It is 105 feet broad and very long. The direction of the chasm itself is from north to south. Its western wall, from which the other has been perpendicularly divided, is 107 feet six inches in height, and consists of many strata, of about 10 inches each in height, of lava grown cold at different times. The eastern wall is only 45 feet four inches in height, and that part of it which is directly opposite to the highest part of the other side is no more than 36 feet 5 inches high.\n\nHECTIC FEVER.

When they are designed as outward fences, they are planted either with hawthorn, crabs, or black-thorn; but those hedges which are planted in gardens, either to surround wilderness-quarters, or to screen the other parts of a garden from sight, are planted according to the fancy of the owner; some preferring evergreens, in which case the holly is best; next the yew, then the laurel, laurustinus, phyllery, &c.

In his earliest years he discovered a strong attachment to the study of botany, in which he afterwards excelled so much. He was left with very little to support him on the death of his father. The fame of Gerlach led him to Zittau in Lusatia, where he prosecuted his studies for three years, assisted by the generosity of different benefactors. He studied philosophy, mathematics, and medicine, at Leipzig, where he was distinguished for his diligence and regularity of deportment. He afterwards assisted Ludwig in the regulation of his library, anatomical museum and botanical garden; and in 1756, he entered into the family of Bose, professor of botany, for whom he prepared plants for demonstration, and attended patients in the public infirmary. In 1759 he took the degree of M.D. and practised at Chemnitz in Saxony, where he entered into the married state.\n\nIt was customary with him to walk the fields by five in the morning, to contemplate the beauties of nature, to visit his patients after breakfast, and spend the afternoon and evening in examining such plants as he had collected during his early excursions. He particularly applied himself to the investigation of the grasses, and indeed of the whole cryptogamia class of plants, which botanists at that period had greatly neglected. At the age of 40, he taught himself to draw and paint the objects which he had discovered, and the compound microscope which he received from Koehler of Dresden, greatly assisted him in those researches. By the persuasion of his second wife (whom he married about a year after the death of his first), he was prevailed with to\nsettle at Leipzig in 1781, where he published his great work, entitled, Fundamentum Historiae Naturalis Muscorum Frondosorum. In this he gave an accurate history of mosses from his own observations, and illustrated the whole with appropriate plates. In it he discovered such sagacity, industry, and profound research, as astonished all the botanists of his time, and induced them to pay more attention to this curious subject. He gained the prize given by the Peterburgh academy for his curious and excellent treatise Theoria Generationis et Fructificationis Plantarum Cryptogamicarum Linnei, mere propriis Observationibus et Experimentis Superstitiva, published in 1784.\n\nHis literary reputation increased his medical practice; he was chosen physician to the town guards in the last mentioned year, and two years after he became professor of medicine in the university. In 1789, he was chosen ordinary professor of botany, and superintended the physic garden. He corrected the false notions which then prevailed, respecting the efficacy of the medulla or pith, the perforation of the flowers, the excrements of plants, the increase of the vessels of vegetables, and the genuine use of the leaves. By the death of a favourite daughter of a consumption at 16 years of age, he received a severe shock; and a catarrhal affection, followed by a nervous fever, deprived the world of that great man on 7th of February 1799, in the 66th year of his age.\n\nIt is agreed on all hands, that Dr Hedwig was a man of great modesty, the usual concomitant of extraordinary talents; that he was friendly and benevolent, upright in his dealings, not solicitous about wealth, and free from parade, both in teaching and in writing. In the forests of Hispaniola there is an ever-green tree, the name of which, Hedwigia balsamifera, was intended in the most honourable manner to perpetuate his memory. He left behind him two sons, one a painter of eminence at Magdeburg, and the other Dr Romanus Adolphus Hedwig, already known to the botanical world by several publications.\n\nHEDYCARIA, a genus of plants belonging to the dioecia class.

See Hemskirk.\n\nHEGIRA, in Chronology, a celebrated epoch among the Mahometans. The word is Arabic, formed of هجرة, hajrath, \"flight;\" of هجر, \"to fly, quit one's country, family, friends, &c.\"\n\nThe event which gave occasion to this epocha, was Mahomet's flight from Mecca. The magistrates of that city, fearing his impostures might raise a sedition, resolved to expel him: this, accordingly, they effected in the year of our Lord 622, on the evening of the 15th or 16th of July. See Arabia, No. 44.\n\nTo render this epocha more creditable, the Mahometans affect to use the word hegira in a peculiar sense for an act of religion, whereby a man forsakes his country, and gives way to the violence of persecutors and enemies of the faith: they add, that the Corashites, being then the strongest party in the city, obliged their prophet to fly, as not being able to endure his abolishing of idolatry. This flight was not the first of Mahomet's, but it was the most famous. It happened in the 14th year from his assuming the character of prophet and apostle, and promulgating his new religion.\n\nThe orientals do not agree with us as to the time of the hegira. Among the Mahometans, Amasi fixes it to the year of Christ 630, and from the death of Moses 2347; and Ben Caffem to the year of the world 5800: according to the Greek computation, among the Christians, Said Ebn Batrik refers the hegira to the year of Christ 614, and of the creation 6114.\n\nKhondemir relates, that it was Omar, the second caliph, that first established the hegira as an epocha, and appointed the years to be numbered from it: at the time he made this decree, there were already seven years elapsed. This establishment was made in imitation of the Christians, who, in those times, reckoned their years from the persecution of Diocletian.\n\nBut there is another hegira, and that earlier too, though of less eminence. Mahomet, in the 14th year of his mission, was obliged to relinquish Medina: the Corashites had all along opposed him very vigorously, as an innovator and disturber of the public peace; and many of his disciples, not enduring to be reputed followers of an impostor, desired leave of him to abandon the city, for fear of being obliged to renounce their religion. This retreat makes the first hegira. These two hegiras the Mahometans, in their language, call hegiratan.\n\nThe years of the hegira consist only of 354 days. To reduce these years to the Julian calendar, i.e. to find what Julian year a given year of the hegira answers to, reduce the year of the hegira given into days, by multiplying by 354, divide the product by\nHEIDEGGER, John James, was the son of a clergyman, and a native of Zurich in Switzerland, where he married, but left his country in consequence of an intrigue. Having had an opportunity of visiting the principal cities of Europe, he acquired a taste for elegant and refined pleasures, as they are called, which united to a strong inclination for voluptuousness, by degrees qualified him for the management of public amusements. In 1738, when he was near 50 years old, he came to England on a negociation from the Swiss at Zurich; but, failing in his embassy, he entered as a private soldier in the guards for protection. By his sprightly engaging conversation and insinuating address, he soon worked himself into the good graces of our young people of fashion; from whom he obtained the appellation of the Swiss Count. He had the address to procure a subscription, with which, in 1739, he was enabled to furnish out the opera of \"Thomyris,\" which was written in English, and performed at the queen's theatre in the Haymarket. The music, however, was Italian; that is to say, airs selected from sundry of the foreign operas by Bunoncini, Scarlatti, Stefani, Galuppi, and Albinoni. Heidegger by this performance alone was a gainer of 500 guineas. The judicious remarks he made on several defects in the conduct of our operas in general, and the hints he threw out for improving the entertainments of the royal theatre, soon established his character as a good critic. Appeals were made to his judgment; and some very magnificent and elegant decorations introduced upon the stage in consequence of his advice, gave such satisfaction to George II. who was fond of operas, that, upon being informed to whose genius he was indebted for these improvements, his majesty was pleased from that time to countenance him, and he soon obtained the chief management of the opera-house in the Haymarket. Heidegger, then set about improving another species of diversion, not less agreeable to the king, which was the masquerades, and over these he always presided at the king's theatre. He was likewise appointed master of the revels. The nobility now cared him so much, and had such an opinion of his taste, that all splendid and elegant entertainments given by them upon particular occasions, and all private assemblies by subscriptions, were submitted to his direction. From the emoluments of these several employments, he gained a regular considerable income, amounting, it is said, in some years, to 5000, which he spent with much liberality, particularly in the maintenance of a somewhat too luxurious table; so that it may be said he raised an income, but never a fortune. At the same time his charities ought not to pass unnoticed, which were frequent and ample. After a successful masquerade, he has been known to give away several hundred pounds at a time. \"You know poor objects of distress better than I do,\" he would frequently say to a particular acquaintance; \"be so kind as to give away this money for me.\" This well-known liberality, perhaps, contributed much to his carrying on that diversion with so little opposition as he met with. He died in 1749, at the advanced age of 90 years.\n\nAs this person was long the Arbiter Elegantiarum of England, and is alluded to in many publications of his time, some account of him, it was thought, might be here expected; but to add all the anecdotes that have appeared concerning him, would enlarge this article beyond the limits to which it is entitled. One or two of the most remarkable, however, are subjoined in a note (A), as they may afford entertainment to many of our readers.\n\nHEIDENHEIM, a town of Germany, in Swabia, and in the territory of Brentzhall, with a handsome palace or castle, belonging to the house of Wurtemberg. E. Long. 10° 19'. N. Lat. 48° 37'.\n\nHEIDELBERG,\n\n(A) Heidegger's countenance was peculiarly unpleasing, from an unusual harshness of features. There is a mezzotint of him by J. Faber, 1742, from a painting by Vanloo, a striking likeness; and his face is introduced in more than one of Hogarth's prints.—Heidegger was, however, the first to joke upon his own ugliness; and he once laid a wager with the earl of Chesterfield, that within a certain given time his lordship would not be able to produce so hideous a face in all London. After strict search, a woman was found, whose features were at first thought stronger than Heidegger's; but upon clapping her head-dress upon himself, he was universally allowed to have won the wager. Jolly, a well-known taylor, carrying his bill to a noble duke; his grace, for evasion, said, \"Damn your ugly face, I never will pay you till you bring me an uglier fellow than yourself!\" Jolly bowed and retired, wrote a letter, and sent it by a servant to Heidegger; saying, \"His grace wished to see him the next morning on particular business.\" Heidegger attended, and Jolly was there to meet him; and in consequence, as soon as Heidegger's visit was over, Jolly received the cash.\n\nThe late facetious duke of Montagu (the memorable author of the Bottle Conjurer at the theatre in the Haymarket) gave an entertainment at the Devil-tavern, Temple-bar, to several of the nobility and gentry, selecting the most convivial, and a few hard drinkers, who were all in the plot. Heidegger was invited, and in a few hours after dinner was made so dead drunk that he was carried out of the room, and laid insensible upon a bed. A profound sleep ensued; when the late Mrs Salmon's daughter was introduced, who took a mould from his face in plaster of Paris. From this a mask was made, and a few days before the next masquerade (at which the king promised to be present, with the countess of Yarmouth) the duke made application to Heidegger's valet-de-chambre, to know what suit of clothes he was likely to wear; and then procuring a similar dress, and a person of the same stature, he gave him his instructions. On the evening of the masquerade, as soon as his majesty was seated (who was always known by the conductor of the entertainment and the officers of the court, though concealed by his dress from the company), Heidegger, as usual, ordered the music to play \"God save the king;\" but his back was no sooner turned, than the false Heidegger ordered them to strike up \"Charly o'er the water.\" The whole company\nHEIL, a town of royal Prussia, in Caffubia, seated at the mouth of the river Vistula, on the Baltic sea, and formerly subject to Poland, 12 miles north of Dantzig.

After having studied at Goillar and Leipzig, he was designed for the ministry, and began to preach; but disliking that profession, he laid it aside, and applied himself entirely to the study of philosophy and the civil law. In 1710, he became professor of philosophy at Hall; and in 1721, he was made professor of civil law, with the title of counsellor of the court. His great reputation made the states of Frieland invite him to Franeker in 1724; but three years after, the king of Prussia prevailed on him to accept of a professorship of law at Francfort on the Oder, where he distinguished himself till the year 1733. Becoming again professor at Hall, he remained there till his death, which happened in 1741, notwithstanding his being invited to Marpurg, Denmark, and three academies in Holland. He wrote many works, all of them much esteemed. The principal are, 1. Antiquitatum Romanarum jurisprudentiam illustrantium sym- tagma. It was this excellent abridgment that gave rise to his reputation in foreign countries. 2. Elementa juris civilis secundum ordinem institutionum et pandectarum. 3. Fundamenta styli cultioris.

Heidegger flew to the music-gallery, swore, stamped, and raved, accusing the musicians of drunkenness, or of being set on by some secret enemy to ruin him. The king and the countess laughed so immoderately, that they hazarded a discovery. While Heidegger stood in the gallery, \"God save the king\" was the tune; but when, after setting matters to rights, he retired to one of the dancing rooms, to observe if decorum was kept by the company, the counterfeit stepping forward, and placing himself upon the floor of the theatre, just in front of the music gallery, called out in a most audible voice, imitating Heidegger, damned them for blockheads, had he not just told them to play \"Charly o'er the water?\" A pause ensued; the musicians, who knew his character, in their turn thought him either drunk or mad; but as he continued his vociferation, \"Charly?\" was played again. At this repetition of the supposed affront, some of the officers of the guards, who always attended upon these occasions, were for ascending the gallery and kicking the musicians out; but the late duke of Cumberland, who could hardly contain himself, interposed. The company were thrown into great confusion. \"Shame! Shame!\" resounded from all parts, and Heidegger once more flew in a violent rage to that part of the theatre facing the gallery. Here the duke of Montagu, artfully addressing himself to him, told him, \"The king was in a violent passion; that his best way was to go instantly and make an apology, for certainly the musicians were mad, and afterwards to discharge them.\" Almost at the same instant, he ordered the false Heidegger to do the same. The scene now became truly comic in the circle before the king. Heidegger had no sooner made a genteel apology for the insolence of his musicians, but the false Heidegger advanced, and in a plaintive tone, cried out, \"Indeed, Sire, it was not my fault but that devil's in my likeness.\" Poor Heidegger turned round, stared, staggered, grew pale, and could not utter a word. The duke then humanely whispered in his ear the sum of his plot, and the counterfeit was ordered to take off his mask. Here ended the frolic; but Heidegger swore he would never attend any public amusement, if that witch the wax-work woman did not break the mould, and melt down the mask before his face.\n\nBeing once at supper with a large company, when a question was debated, Which nationalism of Europe had the greatest ingenuity? to the surprize of all present, he claimed that character for the Swifs, and appealed to himself for the truth of it. \"I was born a Swif (said he), and came to England without a farthing, where I have found means to gain 500l. a-year, and to spend it. Now I defy the most able Englishman to go to Switzerland, and either to gain that income or to spend it there.\"—Heidegger is said to have had so remarkable a memory, that he once walked from Charing-cross to Temple-bar, and back again; and when he came home, wrote down every sign on each side of the street.\nHEINETKEN, CHRISTIAN, an extraordinary child, the prodigy of the North, was born at Lubeck in 1721. He spoke his maternal tongue fluently at ten months. At one year old, he knew the principal events of the pentateuch; in two months more, he was master of the entire history of the Old and New Testaments; at two years and a half, he answered the principal questions in geography and in ancient and modern history; and he spoke Latin and French with great facility before the commencement of his fourth year. His constitution was so delicate, that he was not weaned till a few months before his death. M. Martini of Lubeck published a pamphlet in 1730, in which he endeavoured to give natural reasons for the extraordinary capacity of this infant, who died in his fifth year.\n\nHEINSIUS, DANIEL, professor of politics and history at Leyden, and librarian to the university there, was born at Gand in Flanders in 1580. He became a scholar to Joseph Scaliger at Leyden, and was indebted to the encouragement and care of that great man for the perfection to which he attained in literature, and which at the beginning of his life there was little reason to hope from him. He distinguished himself as a critic by his labours on many classical authors; and was highly honoured as well abroad as at home: Gualtavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, gave him a place among his counsellors of state; the republic of Venice made him a knight of the order of St Mark; and Pope Urban VIII., made him great offers, if he would come, as he expressed it, \"to rescue Rome from barbarism.\" He died in 1666, leaving several works of his own, both in poetry and prose.\n\nHEINSIUS, Nicholas, the son of Daniel Heinsius, was born at Leyden; and became as great a Latin poet, and a greater critic, than his father. His poems have been several times printed, but the best edition is that of Amsterdam in 1666. He gave editions of several of the classics, with notes; his Claudian is dedicated in a Latin poem to Queen Christina of Sweden, and his Ovid to Thuanus. At his death, which happened in 1681, he disclaimed all his works, and expressed the utmost regret at having left behind him so many \"monuments of his vanity,\" as he called them. He was as much distinguished by his great employments in the state, as by his talents, learning, and good qualities.\n\nHEIR, in Law, signifies the person who succeeds another by descent to lands, tenements, and hereditaments, being an estate of inheritance, or an estate in fee; because nothing passes by right of inheritance but in fee.

After being educated in the universities of Germany, he prosecuted the study of anatomy and surgery at Amsterdam, in 1706. Next year he acted as surgeon in the Dutch camp in Brabant, and afterwards studied medicine at Leyden under the celebrated Boerhaave, at the expiration of which he took his degrees. In 1709, he was appointed physician-general to the Dutch military hospital, by which means he acquired vast experience, both in medicine and surgery. He was appointed professor of anatomy and surgery at Altdorf in 1710, where he acquired great celebrity by his lectures and writings.\n\nIn 1720 he removed to the university of Helmstadt, where he continued during the remainder of his life. The czar Peter invited him to Russia; but the esteem in which he was held by different sovereigns induced him to remain in Germany. His death happened in the year 1758, in the 75th year of his age. Dr Heister was uncommonly industrious, and wrote a prodigious number of books; but his principal fame was derived from his singular skill and success in surgery. He is particularly known by his Compendium Anatomicum, which has been frequently reprinted, and translated into different languages. The chief of his surgical publications is his Institutions of Surgery, which was long considered as a standard book of the kind, till it was superseded by more modern systems. As a physician his principal works are, Observations Medico-miscellaneae, Theoreticae et Practicae; De Medicina Mechanicae Prettaniae; and Compendium Institutionum et Fundamentorum Medicine. A Collection of Medical, Chirurgical, and Anatomical Observations, was published after his death in 2 vols quarto.\n\nHEISTERIA, a genus of plants belonging to the decandra clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 12th order, Holaceae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nHELENA, or ST HELENA, an island in the Atlantic ocean, belonging to the English East India Company, and situated in W. Long. 6° 30' S. Lat. 16°. The greatest length of the island is about eight miles, and its circumference is above 20. Some of the mountains are pretty high, covered with wood to the top, and exhibit marks of volcanic eruptions. The country,\ntry, according to Mr Forster, has a fine appearance; the soil is in many places a rich mould, from six to ten inches deep, and a variety of plants thrive in it luxuriantly. He found many plants here which he had not observed in other parts of the world. Among these were some called by the natives cabbage-trees, gum-trees, and red wood. The former thrive in moist places; but the latter are always found on the ridges of hills, where the soil is dry. The cabbage-tree has rather large leaves; but after many inquiries Mr Forster could not find that it was used for any other purpose than that of fuel, and no reason could be assigned why it had obtained that name. It must not be confounded with the cabbage-tree of America, India, and the South seas, which is a species of palm.\n\nThe island is laid out entirely in gardens and pasturage. Besides peaches, we are assured that the plantain and banana thrive here remarkably well. Cabbages, and other greens, which thrive extremely well, are devoured by caterpillars; and every species of corn is destroyed by rats. All the pastures were overrun with furze; which, though in our country a very useless and even pernicious plant, was of singular advantage to the inhabitants of St Helena. Before the introduction of that plant, the ground was parched with the intense heat, and all kinds of grass and herbage were shrivelled up. But the furze-bushes, which throw as it were in despite of the sun, preferred a degree of moisture in the ground; by which means the grass sprang up vigorously, and the country became covered with a rich and beautiful sod. The furze is now no longer wanted, and the people avidly root it out for fuel. The number of people on St Helena does not exceed 2000 persons, including 500 soldiers, and 600 slaves; and it is said that the number of females born on the island considerably exceeds that of the males. By the arrival of the India ships, which they supply with refreshments, they are in return provided with all sorts of manufactures and other necessaries; and the company annually order one or two of their ships to touch there in their way to India, in order to send them a sufficient quantity of European goods and provisions. Many of their slaves are employed in catching fish, which are very plentiful; and by the help of these, together with their poultry, cattle, roots, and salt provisions, they subsist through the year. Their life (says Mr Forster) seems to pass along very happily; free from the multitude of cares which distress their countrymen in England, and blest with quiet and content.\n\nA botanic garden has been established near the country house of the governor, and a well-informed gardener sent by the company to take care of it. The sea around the island abounds with eculent fishes, 70 different species of which have been taken upon the coasts. There are great numbers of whales around the island, where the southern whale fishery, it is believed, might be carried on with great advantage to the nation.\n\nThe country, in general, is cultivated by slaves; but as these are now placed under the protection of the magistracy, and various regulations enacted in their favour, they may comparatively be said to be comfortable and secure. Before these regulations took place, ten out of a hundred were known to die annually, whereas they are now on the increase, and the expenses occasioned by the replacing of those who died formerly are thus avoided.\n\nThere are some blacks who are in a state of freedom, independent of the slaves. These, at first, were obnoxious to the slave owners; but, upon examination, it was found that not one of them had been tried for a crime for several years, nor had any of them been upon the parish. By the humane interference of the company they share the protection of the government, and are almost on a footing with the other free inhabitants, having the benefit of a jury when accused of crimes, as well as in civil cases.\n\nThis country is so fertile, and the climate so exactly suited to the feelings of human nature, that persons indifferent to the enjoyments of the world, or far advanced in years, could scarcely find another spot better calculated to prolong their existence in ease, health, and comfort.\n\nSt Helena was first discovered by the Portuguese in 1502, on St Helen's day; whence its name. They stocked it with different kinds of useful animals; but whether they ever settled a colony on it or not, is uncertain. The Portuguese having either abandoned or never taken possession of it, the Dutch became its masters; and kept possession of it till the year 1600, when they were driven out by the English. In 1673, the Dutch took it by surprise; but a short time after it was recovered by the brave Captain Munden, who also took three Dutch East Indians then lying in the harbour. On this occasion the Hollanders had fortified the landing place, of which there is only one on the island; and erected batteries of great guns to prevent a descent; but the English having knowledge of a small creek, where only two men abreast could creep up, climbed to the top of the rock in the night; and appearing the next morning behind the batteries, the Dutch were so terrified, that they threw down their arms, and surrendered at discretion. This creek has been since fortified, and a battery of large cannon placed at the entrance of it; so that now the island is rendered perfectly secure against all regular approaches or sudden attacks.\n\nAccidents frequently happened in approaching to, or leaving the shore; but a wharf having been erected, the arrivals and departures of vessels are rendered perfectly secure. Storms are little known at St Helena, thunder is a rare occurrence, and lightning is very seldom seen.\n\nHELEN, in fabulous history, the daughter of Tyndarus and Leda, was married to Menelaus king of Sparta, but was stolen from him by Theseus, 1235 B.C. She was restored soon after; but carried off again by Paris, the Trojan prince; which occasioned the famous Trojan war. See TROY.\n\nST HELEN'S. See HELLEN'S.\n\nHELENIUM, BASTARD SUN-FLOWER; a genus of plants belonging to the syngenesia clasps; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositae. See BOTANY Index.\n\nHELENIUS, in fabulous history, a celebrated foothayer, son of Priam and Hecuba. He was greatly respected by all the Trojans. When Deiphobus was given in marriage to Helen in preference to himself, he resolved to leave his country, and retired to Mount Ida, where Ulysses took him prisoner by the advice of Calchas. As he was well acquainted with futurity, the Greeks\nHelenus Greeks made use of prayers, threats, and promises, to induce him to reveal the secrets of the Trojans; and either the fear of death, or gratification of resentment, seduced him to disclose to the enemies of his country, that Troy could not be taken whilst it was in possession of the Palladium, nor before Polydectes came from his retreat at Lemnos and assisted to support the siege. After the ruin of his country, he fell to the share of Pyrrhus the son of Achilles, and saved his life by warning him to avoid a dangerous tempest, which in reality proved fatal to all those who set sail. This endeared him to Pyrrhus; and he received from his hand Andromache the widow of his brother Hector, by whom he had a son called Cepheus. This marriage, according to some, was consummated after the death of Pyrrhus, who lived with Andromache as with a wife. Helenus was the only one of Priam's sons who survived the ruin of his country. After the death of Pyrrhus he reigned over part of Epirus, which he called Chaonia in memory of his brother Chaon, whom he had inadvertently killed. Helenus received Æneas as he voyaged towards Italy, and foretold him some of the calamities which attended his fleet. The manner in which he received the gift of prophecy is doubtful.\n\nHELEPOLIS, in the ancient art of war, a machine for battering down the walls of a place besieged, the invention of which is ascribed to Demetrius Poliorcetes.—Diodorus Siculus says, that each side of the Helepolis was 403 cubits in breadth and 90 in height; that it had nine stages, and was carried on four strong solid wheels eight cubits in diameter; that it was armed with large battering rams, and had two roofs capable of supporting them; that in the lower stages there were different sorts of engines for casting stones; and in the middle they had large catapults for discharging arrows, and smaller ones in those above, with a number of expert men for working all these machines.\n\nHELIADAE, in Mythology, the daughters of the Sun and Clymenus, according to the poets. They were so afflicted, as they say, with the death of their brother Phaeton, that the gods, moved with compassion, transformed them into poplars on the banks of the river Eridanus.\n\nHELLÆA, in Grecian antiquity, was the greatest and most frequented court in Athens for the trial of civil affairs. See HELIASTÆ.\n\nHELIACAL, in Astronomy, a term applied to the rising and setting of the stars; or, more strictly speaking, to their emergence out of and immersion into the rays and superior splendor of the sun.—A star is said to rise heliacally, when, after having been in conjunction with the sun, and on that account invisible, it comes to be at such a distance from him as to be seen in the morning before sunrise; the sun, by his apparent motion, receding from the star towards the east. On the contrary, the heliacal setting is when the sun approaches so near a star as to hide it with his beams, which prevent the fainter light of the star from being perceived; so that the terms apparition and occultation would be more proper than rising and setting.\n\nHELianthus, the GREAT SUNFLOWER; a genus of plants belonging to the syngenesia clas; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, Compositæ. See BOTANY Index.\n\nHELIASTÆ, in antiquity, the judges of the Heliaice court HELLÆA. They were so called, according to some authors, from a Greek word which signifies to assemble in a great number; and, according to others, from another word which signifies the sun, because they held their assemblies in an open place. They composed not only the most numerous, but likewise the most important of the Athenian tribunals; for their province was either to explain the obscure laws, or to give new vigour and authority to those which had been violated. The Thesmothetae convoked the assembly of the Heliaice, which sometimes amounted to 1000, sometimes to 1500, judges. Mr Blanchard is of opinion, that, to make this number, the Thesmothetae sometimes summoned those of each tribe who had left quitting the public offices which they had exercised in another court.\n\nHowever that may be, it appears that the assemblies of the Heliaice were not frequent, as they would have interrupted the jurisdiction of the stated tribunals and the common course of affairs.\n\nThe Thesmothetae paid to each member of this assembly, for his attendance, three oboli; which are equal to two Roman sesterces, or to half a drachma. Hence Aristophanes terms them the brothers of the triobolus. They were likewise condemned to pay a fine if they came too late; and if they did not present themselves till after the orators had begun to speak, they were not admitted. Their attendance was requited out of the public treasury, and their pay was called mythos heliaicus.\n\nThe assembly met, at first, according to Aristophanes, at the rising of the sun. If the judges were obliged to meet under cover on account of frost and snow, they had a fire; but there is not a passage in any ancient author which informs us of the place where these assemblies were held either in the rigorous or in the mild seasons. We only learn, that there was a double enclosure around the assembly, that it might not be disturbed. The first was a kind of arbour-work, from space to space, separated by doors, over which were painted in red the ten or twelve first letters of the Greek alphabet, which directed the entrance of the officers who composed the tribunal, each of them entering under the letter which distinguished his tribe. The beadles of the court, to whom they showed the wand which had been sent them by the Thesmothetae as a summons to meet, examined its mark, to see if it was authentic, and then introduced them. The second enclosure, which was at the distance of 20 feet from the former, was a rope or cord; that the people who stood round the first enclosure, and were desirous to see what passed within the second, might not be prevented from gratifying their curiosity at a proper distance. Thus the attention of the judges was not interrupted by the concourse of the multitude, many of whom were heated by views of interest or of party.\n\nTo each of the members of the assembly were distributed two pieces of copper; one of which was perforated, not certainly that it might be distinguished from the other by feeling, for these assemblies met at the rising and were dissolved at the setting of the sun. Those pieces of copper had been substituted for little sea-shells, which were at first in use. The king was present at the assembly, at whose command it had been summoned.\nHere we have one of the motives of the meeting of Heliax this assembly. Aristotle informs us of another; which was by the public authority deputed to them, to elect a magistrate in the room of one dead. It is surprising that Pausanias, who enters so often into details, gives us no particular account of this assembly. All that he says of it is, that the most numerous of the Athenian assemblies was called Helic.\n\nWe are told by Diogenes Laertius, in his life of Solon, that it was before one of these Heliaitic assemblies that Pisistratus presented himself, covered with wounds and contusions (for thus he had treated himself and the mules which drew his car,) to excite the indignation of the people against his pretended enemies, who, jealous, as he alleged, of the popularity he had acquired by asserting the rights of his poorer fellow-citizens, in opposition to the men in power, had attacked him while he was hunting, and had wounded him in that barbarous manner. His design succeeded: a guard was appointed him; by the assistance of which he acquired the sovereignty or tyranny of Athens, and kept it 33 years. The power of the assembly appeared remarkably on that occasion; for Solon, who was present, opposed it with all his efforts, and did not succeed.\n\nAs to the manner in which the judges gave their suffrages, there was a sort of vessel covered with an oifer mat, in which were placed two urns, the one of copper, the other of wood. In the lid of these urns there was an oblong hole, which was large at the top, and grew narrower downwards, as we see in some old boxes of our churches. The suffrages which condemned the accused person were thrown into the wooden urn, which is termed kyrios. That of copper, named akryos, received those which absolved him.\n\nAristotle observes, that Solon, whose aim was to make his people happy, and who found an aristocracy established by the election of the nine archons (annual officers, whose power was almost absolute), tempered their sovereignty, by instituting the privilege of appealing from them to the people, who were to be assembled by lot to give their suffrage; after having taken the oath of the Heliax, in a place near the Panathenaean; where Hippas had in former days, calmed a sedition of the people, and bound them to unanimity by a oath. It has likewise been remarked, that the god Apollo was not invoked in the oath of the Heliax, as in the oaths of the other judges. We have observed, that he who took the oath of the Heliax, engaged that he would not be corrupted by solicitation or money. Those who violated this part of their oath were condemned to pay a severe fine. The decemvirs at Rome made such corruption a capital crime. But Asconius remarks, that the punishment denounced against them was mitigated in later times; and that they were expelled the senate, or banished for a certain time, according to the degree of their guilt.\n\nHELICOID PARABOLA, or the parabolic spiral, is a curve arising from the supposition that the common or Apollonian parabola is bent or twisted, till the axis comes into the circumference of a circle, the ordinates still retaining their places and perpendicular positions with respect to the circle, all these lines still remaining in the same plane.\nHELICON, in Ancient Geography, the name of a mountain in the neighbourhood of Parnassus and Cytheron, sacred to Apollo and the muses, who are thence called Heliconides. It is situated in Livadia, and now called Zagora or Zagora. Helicon was one of the most fertile and woody mountains in Greece. On it the fruit of the adrahus, a species of the arbutus or of the strawberry-tree, was uncommonly sweet; and the inhabitants affirmed, that the plants and roots were all friendly to man, and that even the serpents had their poison weakened by the innocuous qualities of their food. It approached Parnassus on the north, where it touched on Phocis; and resembled that mountain in loftiness, extent, and magnitude.—Here was the shady grove of the muses and their images; with statues of Apollo and Bacchus, of Linus and Orpheus, and the illustrious poets who had recited their verses to the harp. Among the tripods, in the second century, was that consecrated by Hefiod. On the left hand going to the grove was the fountain Aganippe; and about twenty stadia, or two miles and an half, higher up, the violet-coloured Hippocrene. Round the grove were housetops. A festival was celebrated there by the Thespianians with games called Mufeta. The valleys of Helicon are described by Wheeler as green and flowery in the spring; and enlivened by pleasing cascades and streams, and by fountains and wells of clear water. The Boeotian cities in general, two or three excepted, were reduced to inconsiderable villages in the time of Strabo. The grove of the muses was plundered under the auspices of Constantine the Great. The Heliconian goddesses were afterwards confined in a fire at Constantinople, to which city they had been removed. Their ancient seat on the mountain, Aganippe and Hippocrene, are unascertained.\n\nHELICONIA, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandra clas.

Some say he was deposed by a synod because he would not consent to the suppressing that romance. The fable has a moral tendency, and particularly inculcates the virtue of chastity.\n\nAs it was the first of this species of writing, he is styled Helicon—the Father of Romance. He was also a good Latin poet. He lived in the 4th century.\n\nHELIOMETER, formed of ἀναγωγή, sun, and μέτρον I measure, the name of an instrument called also astrometer, invented by M. Bouguer in 1747, for measuring with particular exactness the diameters of the stars, and especially those of the sun and moon.\n\nThis instrument is a kind of telescope, consisting of two object-glasses of equal focal distance, placed one by the side of the other, so that the same eye-glass serves for both. The tube of this instrument is of a conic form, larger at the upper end, which receives the two object-glasses, than at the lower, which is furnished with an eye-glass and micrometer. By the construction of this instrument two distinct images of an object are formed in the focus of the eye-glass, whose distance, depending on that of the two object-glasses from one another, may be measured with great accuracy: nor is it necessary that the whole disc of the sun or moon come within the field of view, since, if the images of only a small part of the disc be formed by each object-glass, the whole diameter may be easily computed by their position with respect to one another: for if the object be large, the images will approach, or perhaps lie even over one another, and the object-glasses being moveable, the two images may always be brought exactly to touch one another, and the diameter may be computed from the known distance of the centres of the two glasses. Besides, as this instrument has a common micrometer in the focus of the eye-glass, when the two images of the sun or moon are made in part to cover one another, that part which is common to both the images may be measured with great exactness, as being viewed upon a ground that is only one half less luminous than itself; whereas, in general, the heavenly bodies are viewed upon a dark ground, and on that account are imagined to be larger than they really are. By a small addition to this instrument, provided it be of moderate length, M. Bouguer thought it very possible to measure angles of three or four degrees, which is of particular consequence in taking the distance of stars from the moon. With this instrument M. Bouguer, by repeated observation, found that the sun's vertical diameter, though somewhat diminished by the astronomical refraction, is longer than the horizontal diameter; and, in ascertaining this phenomenon, he also found, that the upper and lower edges of the sun's disc are not so equally defined as the other parts; on this account his image appears somewhat extended in the vertical direction. This is owing to the decomposition of light, which is known to consist of rays differently refrangible in their passage through our atmosphere. Thus the blue and violet rays, which proceed from the upper part of the disc at the same time with those of other colours, are somewhat more refracted than the others, and therefore seem to us to have proceeded from a higher point; whereas, on the contrary, the red rays proceeding from the lower edge of the disc, being less refracted than the others, seem to proceed from a lower point; so that the vertical diameter is extended, or appears longer, than the horizontal diameter.\n\nMr Servington Savery discovered a similar method.\nHeliothelia of improving the micrometer, which was communicated to the Royal Society in 1753. See Micrometer.\n\nHELIOPHILA, a genus of plants belonging to the tetradiamia clasps of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 39th order, Siliquofce. See Botany Index.\n\nHELIOPHOBI, a name given to the white negroes or albinos, from their aversion to the light of the sun. See Albinus.\n\nHELIOPOLIS, in Ancient Geography, so called by Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, by Moses On, and in Jeremiah Bethfemus; a city of Egypt, to the south-east of the Delta, and east of Memphis; of a very old standing, its origin terminating in fable. Here stood the temple of the sun, held in religious veneration. The city stood on an extraordinary mount, but in Strabo's time was defoliate. It gave name to the Nomos Helopoliotes.—There was another Helopolis in Coelo-syria, near the springs of the Orontes; so called from the worship of the sun, which was in great vogue over all Syria.\n\nHELIOSCOPE, in Optics, a sort of telescope, peculiarly fitted for viewing the sun without hurting the eyes. See Telescope.\n\nAs the sun may be viewed through coloured glasses without hurt to the eyes, if the object and eye glasses of a telescope be made of coloured glasses, as red or green, such a telescope will become an helioscope.\n\nBut Mr Huygens only used a plain glass, blacked at the flame of a candle on one side, and placed between the eye-glass and the eye; which answers the design of an helioscope very well.\n\nHELIOSTATA, in Optics, an instrument invented by the late learned Dr S. Gravelande, who gave it this name from its fixing, as it were, the rays of the sun in an horizontal direction across the dark chamber all the while it is in use. See Optics Index.\n\nHELIOTROPE (heliotropium), among the ancients; an instrument or machine for showing when the sun arrived at the tropics and the equinoctial line. This name was also used for a sun-dial in general.\n\nHELIOTROPE is also a precious stone, of a green colour, streaked with red veins. Pliny says it is thus called, because, when cast into a vessel of water, the sun's rays falling thereon seem to be of a blood-colour; and that, when out of the water, it gives a faint reflection of the figure of the sun; and is proper to observe eclipses of the sun as a heliometer. The heliotrope is also called oriental jasper, on account of its ruddy spots. It is found in the East Indies, as also in Ethiopia, Germany, Bohemia, &c. Some have ascribed to it the faculty of rendering people invisible, like Gyges's ring.\n\nHELIOTRIUM, turnsole, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clasps, and in the natural method ranking under the 41st order, Aperiflorae. See Botany Index.\n\nHELIOSPHERICAL LINE, is the rhumb line in Navigation, being so termed, because on the globe it winds round the pole helically or spirally, coming still nearer and nearer to it.\n\nHELIX, in Geometry, a spiral line. See Spiral.\n\nThe word is Greek, ἑλίξ, and literally signifies \"a wreath or winding;\" of ἑλίξινος ἐνεργεῖον, \"I environ.\"\n\nIn architecture, some authors make a difference between the helix and the spiral. A staircase, according to Daviler, is in a helix, or is helical, when the stairs or steps wind round a cylindrical newel; whereas the spiral winds round a cone, and is continually approaching nearer and nearer its axis.\n\nHELIX is also applied, in Architecture, to the caulicles or little volutes under the flowers of the Corinthian capital; called also uricle.\n\nHELIX, in Anatomy, is the whole circuit or extent of the auricle or border of the ear outwards. In opposition to which, the inner protuberance surrounded thereby, and answering thereto, is called antelix. See Anatomy, No. 141.\n\nHELIX, the Snail, a genus of shell-fish belonging to the order of vermes testacea. See Conchology Index.\n\nHELL, the place of divine punishment after death. As all religions have supposed a future state of existence after this life, so all have their hell or place of torment in which the wicked are supposed to be punished. The hell of the ancient heathens was divided into two mansions, the one called Elysium, on the right hand, pleasant and delightful, appointed for the souls of good men; the other called Tartara, on the left, a region of misery and torment appointed for the wicked. The latter only was hell, in the present limited sense of the word. See Elysium.\n\nThe philosophers were of opinion, that the infernal regions were at an equal distance from all the parts of the earth; nevertheless it was the opinion of some, that there were certain passages which led thither, as the river Lethe, near the Syrtes, and the Acheronian cave in Epirus. At Hermoine it was thought, that there was a very short way to hell; for which reason the people of that country never put the fare into the mouths of the dead to pay their passage.\n\nThe Jews placed hell in the centre of the earth, and believed it to be situated under waters and mountains. According to them, there are three passages leading to it; the first is in the wilderness, and by that Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, descended into hell; the second is in the sea, because Jonah, who was thrown into the sea, cried to God out of the belly of hell; the third is in Jerusalem, because it is said the fire of the Lord is in Zion, and his furnace is in Jerusalem. They likewise acknowledged seven degrees of pain in hell, because they find this place called by seven different names in Scripture. Though they believed that infidels, and persons eminently wicked, will continue for ever in hell; yet they maintained, that every Jew who is not infected with some heresy, and has not acted contrary to the points mentioned by the rabbins, will not be punished therein for any other crimes above a year at most.\n\nThe Mahometans believe the eternity of rewards and punishments in another life. In the Koran it is said, that hell has seven gates, the first for the Mahommedans, the second for the Christians, the third for the Jews, the fourth for the Sabians, the fifth for the Magians, the sixth for the Pagans, and the seventh for the hypocrites of all religions.\n\nAmong Christians, there are two controverted questions in regard to hell; the one concerns locality, the other the duration of its torments. 1. The locality of hell, and the reality of its fire, began first to be controverted by Origen. That father, interpreting the Scripture\nHellenicus Scripture account metaphorically, makes hell to consist not in external punishments, but in a consciousness or sense of guilt, and a remembrance of past pleasures. Among the moderns, Mr Whiston advanced a new hypothesis. According to him, the comets are so many hells appointed in their orbits alternately to carry the damned into the confines of the sun, there to be scorched by its violent heat, and then to return with them beyond the orb of Saturn, there to starve them in these cold and dismal regions. Another modern author, not satisfied with any hypothesis hitherto advanced, affirms the sun to be the local hell.\n\nAs to the second question, viz. the duration of hell torments, we have Origen again at the head of those who deny that they are eternal; it being that father's opinion, that not only men, but devils, after a due course of punishment suitable to their respective crimes, shall be pardoned and restored to heaven. The chief principle upon which Origen built his opinion, was the nature of punishment, which he took to be emendatory, applied only as physic for the recovery of the patient's health. The chief objection to the eternity of hell torments among modern writers, is the disproportion between temporary crimes and eternal punishments. Those who maintain the affirmative, ground their opinions on Scripture accounts, which represent the pains of hell under the figure of a worm which never dies, and a fire which is not quenched; as also upon the words, \"These shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal.\"\n\nHELLANICUS of Mitylene, a celebrated Greek historian, born before Herodotus, flourished about 480 B.C. He wrote a history of the ancient kings and founders of cities, but which hath not come down to us.\n\nHELLAS, in Ancient Geography, an appellation comprising, according to the more ancient Greeks and Romans, Achaia and Peloponnesus, but afterwards restrained to Achaia. It was bounded on the west by the river Achelous, on the north by mountains Othrys and Oeta, on the east by the Egean sea, and on the south by the Saronic and Corinthian bays, and by the isthmus which joins it to Peloponnesus. It was called Hellas, from Hellen the son of Deucalion; or from Hellas, a district of Thessaly; whence Hellenes, the gentilious name, denoting Greek. Now called Liviadria.\n\nHELLE, in fabulous history, a daughter of Athamas king of Thebes by Nephele. She fled from her father's house with her brother Phryxus, to avoid the cruel opprobrium of her mother-in-law Ino. According to some accounts she was carried through the air on a golden ram which her mother had received from Neptune, and in her passage she became giddy, and fell from her seat into that part of the sea which from her received the name of Hellepont. Others say that she was carried on a cloud, or rather upon a ship, from which she fell into the sea and was drowned. Phryxus, after he had given his sister a burial on the neighbouring coasts, pursued his journey, and arrived in Colchis.\n\nHELLEBORE. See Helleborus.\n\nWhite Hellebore. See Veratrum.\n\nHELLEBORUS, Hellebore, a genus of plants belonging to the pentandria clasps, and in the natural method ranking under the 26th order, Multiflorae. Hellen See Botany Index.\n\nHELLEN, the son of Deucalion, is said to have given the name of Hellenites to the people before called Greeks, 1521 B.C. See Greece.\n\nHELLENISM, in matters of language, a phrase in the idiom, genius, or construction of the Greek tongue. This word is only used when speaking of the authors who, writing in a different language, express themselves in a phraseology peculiar to the Greek.\n\nHELLENISTIC LANGUAGE, that used by the Grecian Jews who lived in Egypt and other parts where the Greek tongue prevailed. In this language it is said the Septuagint was written, and also the books of the New Testament; and that it was thus denominated to show that it was Greek filled with Hebraisms and Syriacisms.\n\nHELLENISTS (Hellenists), a term occurring in the Greek text of the New Testament, and which in the English version is rendered Grecians.\n\nThe critics are divided as to the signification of the word. Ecumenius, in his Scholia on Acts vi. 1, observes, that it is not to be understood as signifying those of the religion of the Greeks, but those who spoke Greek, τοις ἐλληνισταῖς φρενίζομενοι. The authors of the Vulgate version, indeed, render it like ours, Graeci; but Meffieurs Du Port Royal more accurately, Juifs Grecs, Greek or Grecian Jews; it being the Jews who spoke Greek that are here treated of, and who are hereby distinguished from the Jews called Hebrews, that is, who spoke the Hebrew tongue of that time.\n\nThe Hellenists, or Grecian Jews, were those who lived in Egypt and other parts where the Greek tongue prevailed. It is to them we owe the Greek version of the Old Testament, commonly called the Septuagint, or that of the seventy.\n\nSalmasius and Vossius are of a different sentiment with regard to the Hellenists. The latter will only have them to be those who adhered to the Grecian interests.\n\nScaliger is represented, in the Scaligerana, as affirming the Hellenists to be the Jews who lived in Greece and other places, and who read the Greek Bible in their synagogue, and used the Greek language in facris; and thus they were opposed to the Hebrew Jews, who performed their public worship in the Hebrew tongue; and in this sense St Paul speaks of himself as a Hebrew of the Hebrews, Phil. iii. 5, i.e. a Hebrew both by nation and language. The Hellenists are thus properly distinguished from the Hellenes or Greeks, mentioned John xii. 20, who were Greeks by birth and nation, and yet profelytes to the Jewish religion.\n\nHELLENODICAE, Ἑλληνοδικαῖαι, in antiquity, the directors of the Olympian games. At first there was only one, afterwards the number increased to two and to three, and at length to nine. They assembled in a place called Ἑλληνοδικαῖαι, in the Elean forum, where they were obliged to reside ten months before the celebration of the games, to take care that such as offered themselves to contend, performed their προπαρασκευασμένα, or preparatory exercises, and to be instructed in all the laws of games by certain men called νομοφύλακες, i.e. \"keepers of the laws.\" And the better to prevent all unjust practices, they were farther obliged to take an oath.\nHellepont oath, that they would act impartially, would take no bribes, nor discover the reason for which they disliked or approved of any of the contenders. At the solemnity they sat naked, having before them the victor's crown till the exercises were finished, and then it was presented to whomsoever they adjudged it. Nevertheless, there lay an appeal from the hellenodiceae to the Olympian senate.\n\nHELLESPONT, a narrow strait between Asia and Europe, near the Propontis, which received its name from Helle who was drowned there in her voyage to Colchis. It is celebrated for the love and death of Leander, and for the bridge of boats which Xerxes built over it when he invaded Greece. The folly of this great prince is well known in beating and fettering the waves of the sea, whose impetuosity fettered his ships, and rendered all his labours ineffectual. It is now called the Dardanelles. It is about 33 miles long, and in the broadest parts the Asiatic coast is about one mile and a half distant from the European, and only half a mile in the narrowest, according to modern investigation, and the cocks are heard crowing from the opposite shores.\n\nHELLEN'S, St., a town of the isle of Wight, in East-Medina, has a bay which runs a considerable way within land, and in a war with France is often the station and place of rendezvous for the royal navy. At the mouth of the bay is that clutter of rocks called the Mixen. It had an old church situated at the extremity of the coast, which was endangered to be washed away, as was a great part of the church-yard, which occasioned a new church to be built in 1719. The priory to which the old church belonged is now converted into a gentleman's seat; is in a remarkably pleasant situation, and commands a fine prospect of Portsmouth and the road at Spithead. St Hellen's appears to have been of more consideration in former times than at present.\n\nHELM, a long and flat piece of timber, or an assemblage of several pieces, suspended along the hind-part of a ship's stern-post, where it turns upon hinges to the right or left, serving to direct the course of the vessel, as the tail of a fish guides the body.\n\nThe helm is usually composed of three parts, viz. the rudder, the tiller, and the wheel, except in small vessels, where the wheel is unnecessary.\n\nAs to the form of the rudder, it becomes gradually broader in proportion to its distance from the top, or to its depth under the water. The back, or inner part of it, which joins to the stern-post, is diminished into the form of a wedge throughout its whole length, so as that the rudder may be more easily turned from one side to the other, where it makes an obtuse angle with the keel. It is supported upon hinges; of which those that are bolted round the stern-post to the after extremity of the ship, are called goosings, and are furnished with a large hole on the after-part of the stern-post. The other parts of the hinges, which are bolted to the back of the rudder, are called pintles, being strong cylindrical pins, which enter into the goosings, and rest upon them. The length and thickness of the rudder is nearly equal to that of the stern-post.\n\nThe rudder is turned upon its hinges by means of a long bar of timber, called the tiller, which is fixed horizontally in its upper end within the vessel. The movements of the tiller to the right and left, accordingly direct the efforts of the rudder to the government of the ship's course as she advances; which, in the sea-language, is called steering. The operations of the tiller are guided and assisted by a sort of tackle, communicating with the ship's side, called the tiller-rope, which is usually composed of untarred rope-yarns for the purpose of traversing more readily through the blocks or pulleys.\n\nIn order to facilitate the management of the helm, the tiller-rope, in all large vessels, is wound about a wheel, which acts upon it with the powers of a crane or windlass. The rope employed in this service being conveyed from the fore-end of the tiller k, to a single block i, on each side of the ship *, is farther communicated to the wheel, by means of two blocks suspended near the mizen-mast, and two holes immediately above, leading up to the wheel, which is fixed upon an axis on the quarter-deck, almost perpendicularly over the fore-end of the tiller. Five turns of the tiller-rope are usually wound about the barrel of the wheel; and, when the helm is amidship, the middle turn is nailed to the top of the barrel, with a mark by which the helmsman readily discovers the situation of the helm, as the wheel turns it from the starboard to the larboard side. The spokes of the wheel generally reach about eight inches beyond the rim or circumference, serving as handles to the person who steers the vessel. As the effect of a lever increases in proportion to the length of its arm, it is evident that the power of the helmsman to turn the wheel will be increased according to the length of the spokes beyond the circumference of the barrel.\n\nWhen the helm, instead of lying in a right line with the keel, is turned to one side or the other, as in BD (fig. 1.), it receives an immediate shock from the water, which glides along the ship's bottom in running aft from A to B; and this fluid pushes it towards the opposite side, whilst it is retained in this position: so that the stern, to which the rudder is confined, receives the same impression, and accordingly turns from B to b about some point c, whilst the head of the ship passes from A to a. It must be observed, that the current of water falls upon the rudder obliquely, and only strikes it with that part of its motion which acts according to the sine of incidence, pushing it in the direction of NP, with a force which not only depends on the velocity of the ship's course, by which this current of water is produced, but also upon the extent of the sine of incidence. This force is by consequence composed of the square of the velocity with which the ship advances, and the square of the sine of incidence, which will necessarily be greater or smaller according to circumstances; so that if the vessel runs three or four times more swiftly, the absolute shock of the water upon the rudder will be nine or sixteen times stronger under the same incidence: and, if the incidence is increased, it will yet be augmented in a greater proportion, because the square of the sine of incidence is more enlarged. This impression, or, what is the same thing, the power of the helm, is always very feeble, when compared with the weight of the vessel; but as it operates with the force of a long lever, its efforts to turn the ship are extremely advantageous. For the helm being applied to a great distance from the\nthe centre of gravity G, or from the point about which the vessel turns horizontally, if the direction PN of the impulsion of the water upon the rudder be prolonged, it is evident that it will pass perpendicularly to R, widely distant from the centre of gravity G; thus the absolute effort of the water is very powerful. It is not therefore surprising, that this machine impels the ship with a considerable circular movement, by pushing the stern from B to b, and the head from A to a; and even much farther whilst the sails fall with rapidity, because the effect of the helm always keeps pace with the velocity with which the vessel advances.\n\nAmongst the several angles that the rudder makes with the keel, there is always one position more favourable than any of the others, as it more readily produces the desired effect of turning the ship, in order to change her course. To ascertain this, it must be considered, that if the obliquity of the rudder with the keel is greater than the obtuse angle ABD, so as to diminish that angle, the action of the water upon the rudder will increase, and at the same time oppose the course of the ship in a greater degree; because the angle of incidence will be more open, so as to present a greater surface to the shock of the water, by opposing its passage more perpendicularly. But at that time the direction NP of the effort of the helm upon the ship will pass with a smaller distance from the centre of gravity G towards R, and less approach the perpendicular NL, according to which it is absolutely necessary that the power applied should act with a greater effect to turn the vessel. Thus it is evident, that if the obtuse angle ABD is too much inclosed, the greatest impulse of the water will not counterbalance the loss sustained by the distance of the direction NP from NL, or by the great obliquity which is given to the same direction NP of the absolute effort of the helm with the keel AB. If, on the contrary, the angle ABD is too much opened, the direction NP of the force of the action of the helm will become more advantageous to turn the vessel, because it will approach nearer the perpendicular NL; so that the line prolonged from NP will increase the line GR, by removing R to a greater distance from the centre of gravity G; but then the helm will receive the impulsion of the water too obliquely, for the angle of incidence will be more acute; so that it will only present a small portion of its breadth to the shock of the water, and by consequence will only receive a feeble effort. By this principle it is easy to conceive, that the greatest distance GR from the centre of gravity G, is not sufficient to repair the diminution of force occasioned by the too great obliquity of the shock of the water. Hence we may conclude, that when the water either strikes the helm too directly, or too obliquely, it loses a great deal of the effect it ought to produce. Between the two extremes there is therefore a mean position, which is the most favourable to its operations.\n\nThe diagonal NP of the rectangle IL represents the absolute direction of the effort of the water upon the helm. NI expresses the portion of this effort which is opposed to the ship's head-way, or which pushes her aft, in a direction parallel to the keel. It is easily perceived, that this part NI of the whole power of the helm contributes but little to turn the vessel; for, if IN\n\nis prolonged, it appears that its direction approaches to a very small distance GV from the centre of gravity G; and that the arm of the lever BN=GV, to which the force is applied, is not in the whole more than equal to half the breadth of the rudder; but the relative force NL, which acts perpendicular to the keel, is extremely different. If the first NI is almost useless, and even pernicious, by retarding the velocity; the second NL is capable of a very great effect, because it operates at a considerable distance from the centre of gravity G of the ship, and acts upon the arm of a lever GE, which is very long. Thus it appears, that between the effects NL and NI, which result from the absolute effort NP, there is one which always opposes the ship's course, and contributes little to her motion of turning; whilst the other produces only this movement of rotation, without operating to retard her velocity.\n\nGeometers have determined the most advantageous angle made by the helm with the line prolonged from the keel, and fixed it at $54^\\circ 44'$, presuming that the ship is as narrow at her floating-line, or at the line described by the surface of the water round her bottom, as at the keel. But as this supposition is absolutely false, in as much as all vessels augment their breadth from the keel upward to the extreme breadth, where the floating-line or the highest water-line is terminated; it follows, that this angle is too large by a certain number of degrees. For the rudder is impelled by the water, at the height of the floating-line, more directly than at the keel, because the fluid exactly follows the horizontal outlines of the bottom; so that a particular position of the helm might be supposed necessary for each different incidence which it encounters from the keel upwards. But as a middle position may be taken between all these points, it will be sufficient to consider the angle formed by the sides of the ship, and her axis, or the middle line of her length, at the surface of the water, in order to determine afterwards the mean point, and the mean angle of incidence.\n\nIt is evident that the angle $54^\\circ 44'$ is too open, and very unfavourable to the ship's head-way, because the water acts upon the rudder there with too great a fine of incidence, as being equal to that of the angle which it makes with the line prolonged from the keel below; but above, the shock of the water is almost perpendicular to the rudder, because of the breadth of the bottom, as we have already remarked. If then the rudder is only opposed to the fluid, by making an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the line prolonged from the keel, the impulsion, by becoming weaker, will be less opposed to the ship's head-way, and the direction NP of the absolute effort of the water upon the helm drawing nearer to the lateral perpendicular, will be placed more advantageously, for the reasons above mentioned. On the other hand, experience daily testifies, that a ship flees well when the rudder makes the angle DBE equal to $35^\\circ$ only.\n\nIt has been already remarked, that the effect of moving the wheel to govern the helm increases in proportion to the length of the spokes; and so great is the power of the wheel, that if the helmsman employs a force upon its spokes equivalent to 30 pounds, it will produce an effect of 90 or 120 pounds upon the tiller.\nOn the contrary, the action of the water is collected into the middle of the breadth of the rudder, which is very narrow in comparison with the length of the tiller; so the effort of the water is very little removed from the fulcrum B upon which it turns; whereas the tiller forms the arm of a lever 10 or 15 times longer, which also increases the power of the helmsman in the same proportion that the tiller bears to the lever upon which the impulse of the water is directed. This force then is by consequence 10 or 15 times stronger; and the effort of 30 pounds, which at first gave the helmsman a power equal to 90 or 120 pounds, becomes accumulated to one of 900 or 1800 pounds upon the rudder. This advantage then arises from the shortness of the lever upon which the action of the water is impressed, and the great comparative length of the tiller, or lever, by which the rudder is governed; together with the additional power of the wheel that directs the movements of the tiller, and still farther accumulates the power of the helmsman over it. Such a demonstration ought to remove the surprise with which the prodigious effect of the helm is sometimes considered, from an inattention to its mechanism: for we need only to observe the pressure of the water, which acts at a great distance from the centre of gravity G, about which the ship is supposed to turn, and we shall easily perceive the difference there is between the effort of the water against the helmsman, and the effect of the same impulse against the vessel. With regard to the person who steers, the water acts only with the arm of a very short lever NB, of which B is the fulcrum; on the contrary, with regard to the ship, the force of the water is impressed in the direction NP, which passes to a great distance from G, and acts upon a very long lever EG, which renders the action of the rudder extremely powerful in turning the vessel; so that, in a large ship, the rudder receives a shock from the water of 2700 or 2800 pounds, which is frequently the case when the sails at the rate of three or four leagues by the hour; and this force being applied in E, perhaps 100 or 110 feet distant from the centre of gravity G, will operate upon the ship, to turn her about, with 270,000 or 308,000 pounds; whilst, in the latter case, the helmsman acts with an effort which exceeds not 30 pounds upon the spokes of the wheel.\n\nAfter what has been said of the helm, it is easy to judge, that the more a ship increases her velocity with regard to the sea, the more powerful will be the effect of the rudder; because it acts against the water with a force, which increases as the square of the swiftness of the fluid, whether the ship advances or retreats; or, in other words, whether she has head-way or stern-way: with his distinction, that in these two circumstances the effects will be contrary. For if the vessel retreats, or moves astern, the helm will be impressed from I to N; and instead of being pushed, according to NP, it will receive the effort of the water from N towards R; so that the stern will be transported to the same movement, and the head turned in a contrary direction.\n\nWhen the helm operates by itself, the centre of rotation of the ship, and her movement, are determined by estimating the force of this machine; that is to say, by multiplying the surface of the rudder by the square of the ship's velocity.\n\nThere are several terms in the sea-language relating to the helm; as, Bear up the helm; that is, Let the ship go more large before the wind. Helm a mid-ship, or right the helm: that is, Keep it even with the middle of the ship. Port the helm, Put it over the left side of the ship. Starboard the helm, Put it on the right side of the ship.\n\nHELMET, an ancient defensive armour worn by horsemen both in war and in tournaments. It covered both the head and face, only leaving an aperture in the front secured by bars, which was called the visor.\n\nIn achievements, it is placed above the escutcheon for the principal ornament, and is the true mark of chivalry and nobility. Helmets vary according to the different degrees of those who bear them. They are also used as a bearing in coats of arms. See HERALDRY.\n\nHELMINTHOLITHUS, in Natural History, a name given by Linnaeus to petrified bodies resembling worms.\n\nOf these he reckons four genera. 1. Petrified lithophyta. 2. Petrified shells. 3. Petrified zoophytes. 4. Petrified reptiles.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nUnder this head we propose to give the natural history of those animals which Linnaeus has arranged under the class of VERMES, forming the last class of the animal kingdom. The title which we have adopted for this article is derived from the Greek ἰχθύς, an earthworm, and λόγος, a discourse.\n\nIn this article we are to consider, not only those animals which are commonly known by the name of worms, but all those which have the same general character of being slow in motion, of a soft substance, extremely tenacious of life, capable of reproducing such parts of their body as may have been taken away or destroyed, and inhabiting moist places.\n\nLinnaeus has divided the class into five orders.\n\n1. Integmina, consisting of animals which are very simple in their structure, and most of which live within other animals; such as the worms which infest the intestines of man, quadrupeds, &c., though many of them are found in moist clay, and other damp situations.\n\n2. Mollusca, containing such animals as have naked Mollusca bodies, or are not furnished with shells, but are provided with tentacula or arms, being mostly inhabitants of the sea.\n\n3. Testacea,\n3. *Tetacea*, differing from the former in little more than their being furnished with calcareous, flaky coverings, which they carry about with them, constituting the great variety of shell-fish, snails, &c.\n\n4. *Zoophyta*, containing such creatures as seem to bear a resemblance both to plants and animals; being fixed to one place by a foot or root, and shooting up into items like plants, but possessing besides the powers of animation, and partially of locomotion.\n\n5. *Infusoria*, comprising those animated beings generally called *animalcules*, that are found in most watery liquors; especially in the infusions of vegetable substances.\n\nOf these five orders, only four fall to be particularly considered in this article, the *Tetacea* having been already fully treated of under *Conchology*.\n\nThe animals which we are about to describe are generally considered as the lowest in the scale of animated beings. The simplicity of their form, the humility of their station, and the low degree of sense and motion which most of them enjoy, render them an object of little attention to mankind in general, excepting in so far as they contribute to the supply of their wants, or render themselves formidable, by the pain and distress which they occasion to those bodies which nature seems to have destined for their habitation. But to the eye of the naturalist, every part of nature becomes interesting, and this humble class of beings has, in later times, attracted a considerable share of attention.\n\nStill, however, this part of natural history is much more imperfect than any other, and so it will probably long remain, partly from the difficulty of prosecuting our enquiries, and partly from the little interest which a superficial observation of many of these animals is calculated to excite. It will not be thought extraordinary that they are less known than other animals, when we consider, that the examination of them does not offer so many allurements as that of insects, birds, and the more showy part of the animal creation, and is besides impeded by much greater difficulties. Many of them cannot be obtained without diving to the bottom of the sea, or braving pain and danger in the pursuit. The *Furia infernalis* attacks the searcher in the marshy plains of Bothnia, and the *Sepia octopus* stretches forth his gigantic arms, to entangle and drag him to his watery den. Hence the opportunities of examination are often rare; and from the changes which many of the species undergo, we cannot always be certain whether one which we may meet with hereafter be a new species, or one which we have seen before.\n\nThis circumstance has occasioned several varieties to be described as distinct species, and the same species to be repeated under different names, to the great confusion of the naturalist. Again; the confusion of their bodies is, in many cases, so soft, that they can scarcely be preferred in our cabinets, and thus the observer is deprived of one of the chief sources of information and reference, which, in other departments of the science, is so well calculated to assist his studies.\n\nThe study of helminthology, however, holds out many inducements to the admirer of nature's works, as stages at it affords an ample field for the gratification of his curiosity, and may even be rendered subservient to the advancement of more solid and useful knowledge.\n\nIf we consider the number of animals, which naturalists have included under the general name of worms; if we observe the simplicity of form in some of them, and the complicated structure of others; in fine, if we reflect on the various modes in which they are propagated, and on the surprising faculty, which many of them possess, of spontaneous reproduction: the imagination will be astonished with their number and variety, and confounded by their wonderful properties. The waters are peopled with myriads of animated beings, which, though invisible to our unassisted eyes, are endowed with organs as perfect as the largest animals, since, like these, they reproduce their like, and hold in the scale of nature a rank as little equivocal, though less obvious and obtrusive. The elegance of form and beauty of colour, which some of the *mollusca* and *zoophyta* possess, must render them an object of admiration to the most indifferent observer.\n\nThe physiologist will derive considerable assistance in explaining some obscure functions of the animal economy, from a comparative view of them in this humble class of beings; while the physician, by acquiring a knowledge of the habits of such of them as infect the bodies of man, will be the better able to ascertain their presence, expel them from their habitation, or counteract their effects. The geologist, though he cannot admit the hypothesis of Buffon, that all the limestone of this earth has been formed from the relics of corals and shell-fish, will yet here trace the origin of many of the secondary strata, and from the wonderfully rapid production of coral reefs, which we shall notice towards the conclusion of this article, will find little difficulty in accounting for the evolution of new land from the bosom of the deep.\n\nWe shall divide the sequel of this article into two chapters, the first of which will contain a general view of the classification of the genera, and in the second will be given the classification and natural history of the species. The latter will be sub-divided into four sections, corresponding to the four orders of *intestina*, *mollusca*, *zoophyta*, and *infusoria*. As we are able to devote but a small portion of our work to this subject, we shall confine any particular description to those species which are of most importance; and to relieve the tediums of systematic arrangement, we shall mention everything worth notice under the genus or species then under consideration.\nLINNAEUS, whose extensive genius has displayed itself so eminently in almost every department of natural history, has, perhaps, failed more in this part of the science than in any other. In the earlier editions of the Systema Naturae, the individuals described are comparatively few, and the characters of many of them are imperfect or erroneous. These imperfections must be attributed to the small progress which helminthology had made in the beginning of last century, as the discoveries of succeeding naturalists have contributed not only to increase the number of genera and species far beyond what were known at that time, but also to improve their distinguishing characters.\n\nM. Brugiere, to whom this part of the Encyclopedie Methodique was allotted, made several alterations in the arrangement of Linnaeus, whose general classification he has followed in the tabular view of the subject prefixed to the plates of helminthology. M. Brugiere's work is entitled to much praise, and it is to be regretted that he did not live to complete his undertaking.\n\nThe arrangement of these animals given by Cuvier, is in great esteem on the continent, and will probably, when fully completed by future discoveries of that celebrated naturalist, supercede the Linnean classification. Cuvier has given a tabular view of his classification, at the end of the first volume of his Comparative Anatomy, and a more detailed account in his Tableau Elementaire d'Histoire Naturelle. He arranges the vermes of Linnaeus under three heads; MOLLUSCA, WORMS, and Zoophytes. The following is a translation of the tables.\n\nI. MOLLUSCA.\n\nA.

Cuvier has made several alterations and additions to the class of Mollusca, which are the subject of several excellent memoirs published in the Annales de Museum National; in particular he has formed a new order in this class, to which he gives the following characters. Body free, swimming; head distinct; having no other member but fins. In this order he arranges three genera, the old genus Clion, and two new ones, which he calls Hyale and Pneumoderme.\n\nAs the arrangement of Linnaeus is still that which is most generally received, especially in this country, and is therefore most familiar to our readers, we shall follow it in this article.\n\nGENERIC CHARACTERS.\n\nOrdo I.

INTESTINA.\n\nLINNAEUS gave the name of intestina to this order,\nfrom the circumstances of their living in concealed situa-\ntions; while others have denominated these worms in-\ntestinal, from the ordinary habitation of many of them;\nviz. the intestines of other animals. As all of this or-\nder, however, do not live in these situations, the term\nis not strictly proper. It would perhaps be better to\nfollow the example of Goeze, and arrange all the para-\nsitical worms in a separate order.\n\nThe most esteemed works on the subject of the intes-\ntina, are those of Pallas, De infestis viventibus intra vi-\nventia; Muller, Historia vermium; Bloch, a work in\nGerman, afterwards translated into French; Goeze,\nwho also published in German; Werner, Lamarck, La-\ntreille; and two papers by our countrymen Mr Carlisle\nand Dr Hooper, which will be mentioned particularly\nhereafter.\n\nAnatomists have not examined a sufficient number of\nthese animals, to render an account of their general\nstructure either accurate or interesting; but we shall\ntake occasion to detail that of some of the more impor-\ntant species under their proper heads.\n\nThere is nothing in the economy of animals more\nobscure, than the origin of those intestinal worms which\ninhabit within other animals. Were they found to live\nout of these animals, it might easily be supposed that\ntheir ovula were taken with the food and drink into the\nbody, and there gradually evolved into perfect worms.\n\nVol. X. Part I.\n\nThis, however, is not the case; most of them do not\nseem capable of living for any length of time in any\nother situation than within a living animal body, which\nappears to be the proper place for their growth and re-\nsidence. We might hence be led to another supposi-\ntion; that these worms are really formed from the mat-\nter within the intestines, which had previously no re-\ngular organization, were not this idea widely different\nfrom all analogy in the production of animals, where\nthere has been any proper opportunity of examining\nthis production. The origin, therefore, of these ani-\nmals is a subject of much obscurity. Dr Baillie is of\nopinion, that when the whole evidence in support of\nboth hypotheses is compared, the grounds for believing\nthat, in some orders of animals, equivocal generation\ntakes place, appear stronger than those for a contrary\nopinion.\n\nMerid. Anatomy, chap. viii.\n\nI. ASCARIS.\n\nBody round, elastic, and tapering towards each extremi-\nty; head furnished with three vehicles; tail either\nlobulate or obtuse; intestines spiral, white, and pel-\nlucid.\n\nThis tribe is one of the most numerous of these para-\nsitical worms, late discoveries having discovered species\nof it in a great variety of animals, quadrupeds, birds,\nfishes, insects, and even worms themselves. The most\nimportant are those which inhabit the human intestines;\nand to these we shall chiefly confine our attention, avail-\ning ourselves of the excellent paper on these worms in-\nferred by Dr Hooper in the fifth volume of the Memoirs\nof the Medical Society of London.\n\nU u A. Infesting\nA. Ingesting Man.\n\nHead slightly curved inwards, with a transverse contraction beneath it; mouth triangular. Fig. 1.\n\nWhen full grown, they are from 12 to 15 inches in length; and in circumference equal to that of a goose quill.\n\nThe head is to be distinguished from the tail by a small contraction, very obvious when the worm is lying down; it is trilobated, having three vehicles and a triangular aperture, between which is the mouth. These three globose papillae are joined together at their bases, and are of the same colour as the rest of the worm.\n\nThe tail may be known from the head by its very acute termination, close to which is a large orifice, the extremity of the intestinal canal, which may determine the anus.\n\nThe body is that part between the two extremities, forming nearly the whole of the worm; it puts on a rugose appearance, and has a line very apparent running on each side, and extending from one end to the other. Between these two lines are two other lines running parallel with the former, scarcely visible. Near the middle of the body (rather towards the head) is a circular depression of about one fourth of an inch in extent, in which is a very small punctiform aperture. This depressed band is irregular in its appearance, when the body of the worm is distended, although it would appear to be wanting when collapsed, in which state it mostly escapes from the intestines.\n\nThey generally infest the small intestines, and of these more frequently the course of the jejunum and ileum. Sometimes they are known to ascend through the duodenum into the stomach, and are frequently seen to creep out at the mouth and nostrils; it happens but rarely that they descend into the large intestine, and only after the exhibition of worm medicines, or from other causes, which increase the peristaltic motion. They have also been detected, after death, in the common biliary duct, and instances are related where they have remained a considerable time in the gall bladder.\n\nThey are in general very numerous, and Dr Hooper relates an instance of above two hundred having been voided in the course of a week. Thirty or forty is a very common number, but now and then only one is found.\n\nWhen recently excluded they are transparent, and appear as if they had been sucking water tinged with blood; this colour, however, soon disappears, and they become at length of a light and opaque yellow.\n\nWhen voided they are in general very feeble and soon die, but when suddenly expelled, they sometimes appear very lively. Their motion is serpentine, but is not produced by the diminution of the length of the animal by contraction. The head is sent forward by the worm curling itself into circles, and suddenly extending itself with considerable force to some distance.\n\nThis species does not, like most of this order appear to be hermaphrodite, but the male and female are said to be distinct worms.\n\nThe covering or external membrane of the worm, which may be considered as the cuticle, is very strong, elastic, thin, smooth, and transparent; and easily separates from the parts beneath, if the worm be macerated a few days after death in water.\n\nUnder the cuticle lies the cutis, or true skin, which is considerably thicker than the former, and retains the marks of the muscles which it covers. It is also very strong, elastic, and transparent.\n\nWhen the cutis is removed, the muscles, observable through the skin of the worm, present themselves. They do not entirely surround the worm, as from their appearance one would be induced to believe; but are, in fact, two distinct orders acting in opposition to each other; for the two longitudinal lines, which extend from one extremity of the worm to the other, are each of them composed of two distinct tendons, separable from one another. These tendons serve for the attachment of the circular muscles, which cover the worm from the head to the tail.\n\nUpon removing carefully the semilunar muscles from the head to the depressed band, a number of minute vehicles are to be seen (by means of a glass) filled with a submucous fluid, which flows out upon puncturing them.\n\nThis cellular or parenchymatous apparatus, closely embraces the intestinal tube from the head to the depressed band; but from thence to the tail, there is merely a fibrous connecting substance, similar to what is generally called cellular membrane.\n\nWhen the muscles are removed from the depressed band to the tail of the worm, an extremely delicate membrane presents itself, analogous to the peritoneum, for it embraces the abdominal viscera, and lines the cavity of the abdomen.\n\nThe cavity of the abdomen extends from the depressed band near the middle of the worm to the tail; it is mostly distended with a transparent fluid, and contains the intestinal tube and an apparatus supposed to be subservient to generation, which constitute the abdominal viscera.\n\nThe intestinal canal begins at the obtuse extremity or head, from the external triangular mouth situated between the three globose papillae, and is continued for a small space downwards (nearly half an inch) in a parallel form. Having attained the size of a crow quill, it passes in a straight direction (and gradually enlarges as it advances) through the whole length of the worm, to within the eighth part of an inch, where it becomes suddenly narrower, and terminates in the anus.\n\nThis canal is generally filled with a greenish-coloured fluid, of the confluence of mucus, and not very unlike to the meconium of infants.\n\nIf a portion of this tube be macerated for a few days in water, it exhibits distinct coats, the external of which is a production of the peritoneum; it is externally covered with filaments, which connect it to the abdominal parietes. The second viscus is considered by some as peculiar only to the female worm, but all agree, that it is for the purpose of generation. It begins near the middle of the worm, where the cavity of the abdomen commences, by a slender tube, which is continued from the punctiform aperture, situated in the depressed band between the two longitudinal lines. This tube, which is termed the vagina, soon becomes much larger, when it commences uterus, and divaricates into two large crura, which, for the space of four or five inches, are continued of an uniform diameter; they then on a sudden,\nSpecies. Intestina.\n\nfudden, become much diminished in size, and appear like opake threads, embracing in every direction, the intestinal tube. These are by Werner considered as the fallopian tubes.\n\nThis convoluted apparatus is composed of very fine transparent membranes. It is never found empty, but is always distended with an opaque fluid, in which are a number of globular bodies, or ovula, containing young worms.\n\nIt has been supposed by some that these worms are viviparous; an opinion which seems to have arisen from mistaking the nature of an appearance that not unfrequently takes place; viz. a protrusion of the gyrated apparatus above described, the filaments of which look very much like young worms. A convincing proof of their being oviparous is afforded by the fact, that ovula, differing in no respect from those found in the uterus of the worm, have been found in the mucus of the intestines by which they are surrounded.\n\nThis species was long considered as the same with the common earth worm, to be mentioned presently. There are, however, many striking differences, which will be enumerated under that species.\n\nHead subulate; skin at the sides of the body very finely wrinkled. Vid. fig. 3. and 4.\n\nWhen full grown, it is about half an inch long, and in thickness resembles a fine piece of thread. The body forms about a third part of the length of the animal, beginning immediately from the head, and terminating in the tail, which is distinguished by its gradually diminishing. The worm is wrinkled, annular, and pellucid. The tail terminates in a fine point; and when viewed with a magnifying glass, appears furnished with wrinkles or thick firm rings, and at its beginning there is a small opening through which the excrements pass.\n\nThey are most commonly situated in the rectum, and are continually passing away. They are frequently met with in the cæcum and colon, and have been found in the stomach and small intestines, lying hid between their coats. They are generally in considerable numbers, especially in the rectum of children; when they inhabit other parts, their numbers are less considerable, though above an hundred have been known to be vomited from the stomach of a young woman in the course of a day.\n\nTheir natural colour is a pale yellow, though they are often observed of a pale green, or occasionally of a brown colour.\n\nWhen the animal wishes to shift his place, he first moves his head, which he turns in every direction, sometimes in a circle, at others so as to form the figure eight; most commonly its tail appears fixed, while it turns its body sometimes to one side, and sometimes to another. They are extremely lively, and have been seen to bury themselves almost instantaneously in the soft tissues of children, when they are exposed to the air. By some they are said to jump from one place to another; and hence the name *ascariides*, or leaping worms, from *araneus*, to leap.\n\nThese animals are certainly male and female, and, unlike the last species, they are viviparous.\n\nThe integuments of this species resemble those of the last, but there do not appear to be any longitudinal bands on its surface. The cavity, in which the bowels are situated, begins at a very small distance from the head, and terminates at the commencement of the tail.\n\nThe only visceræ in the male worm are the gullet, the stomach, and the intestine. The gullet begins at the mouth, from which it gradually enlarges for a small space, till it terminates in the stomach. This is a roundish bag, forming with the gullet, an organ shaped like the pestle of a mortar. The intestinal canal is continued, more or less contracted or dilated, till it terminates in the anus. The contents of this canal are always of a dark brown colour.\n\nBesides these organs, the female has an apparatus appropriated to generation. It begins by a slender tube leading from a very small opening that is situated nearly in the middle of the body of the worm. It soon becomes much larger, embraces the intestinal tube in every direction, and fills up the cavity of the worm. It is nearly of an equal size throughout, and when viewed with a microscope, it appears like a bladder distended with living worms.\n\nVarious mammalia are also infested with ascarides, of which the following species are enumerated.\n\nA. vespertilionis, found in the long-eared bat; pho-mammali-ca, found in several species of seal; bifida, inhabiting um. the phoca Greenlandica, or Greenland seal; * canis, in the intestines of the dog; visceralis, in the kidneys of the same animal; lupi, in the wolf; vulpis, in the fox; leonis, found under the skin of the lion; tigridis, in the intestines of the tiger; fells and cati, both found in the cat; martis, in the intestines of the martin; bronchialis, in the lungs, and renalis, in the kidneys of the same animal; mephitidis, in the viscera of the skunk; gulonis, in the glutton; talpe, in the mole; muris, in the mouse; hirci, in the goat; vituli, in the lungs of cattle; * equi, in the horse; suis, in the intestines of swine, and apri, in the lungs of the boar.\n\nThe following species are found in birds.\n\nA. Aquilae, in the eagle; albicillæ, in the intestines of avium; the falco albicilla; buteonis, in the buzzard; milvi, in the kite; sibbutonis, in the hobby; hermaphrodita, in the pithecus ætivus; cornicis, of the crow; coracis, in the skin about the throat of the roller; cygni, in the swan; anatis, in the wild duck; fuligulae, in the tufted duck; * carbonis, in the corvorum; * pelicanis, in the flag; lari, in the gull; ciconiae, in the stork; tardi, and the papillofa, in the intestines of the buzzard; gallopavium, in the turkey; galli, in young fowls; gallinae, in the hen; phasianis, in the phasianus pictus; tetraonis, in the grouse; columbae, in the house pigeon; alaudae, in the lark; sturni, in the starling, and turdi, in the thrush.\n\nThe following infest reptiles.\n\nA. testudinis, the round tortoise; lacertæ, the newt; reptilium, bufonis, the toad; pulmonalis, the lungs of the toad; rubetrae, also in the toad and matter jack; trachealis, in the lungs of the toad; range and intestinalis, found in the intestines of frogs; dyspnoeas, in the lungs of frogs, so as to impede their respiration; and insons, also found in the lungs of frogs, but without impeding their breathing.\n\nThe following infest fish.\n\nAnguillæ, found in the eel; * marina, in herrings; piscium, bleaks, and other fish; blemni, in the blenny; rhombi, in the pearl; percæ, in the perch; globicola, found in the three-spined stickle-back; * lacustris, in the stickle-back and pike; siluri, in the silurus glans;\nfationis, in the trout; truttae, in the trout; marcesse, in the latino marina; acus, in the common pike; haecis, in the herring; argentinus, in the argentine or silver fish; gobiensis, in the liver of the gudgeon; raja, in the tail-ray; squale, in the shark; and lophii, in the gullet of the frog fish.\n\nOne species, viz. A. lumbrici, is found in lumbrici, between the skin and humours, though it is so small, as to be visible only by means of a microscope.\n\nThe species of ascaris already known, amount to about eighty.\n\n\"We are not to suppose (says Mr Bingley) that these worms are created for the purpose of producing disease in the animals they inhabit, but rather, that nature has directed that no situation should be vacant, where the work of multiplying the species of living creatures could be carried on. By thus allowing them to exist within each other, the sphere of increase is considerably enlarged. There is, however, little doubt that worms, and more especially the tape worms (to be perfectly described), do sometimes produce diseases in the body they inhabit; but we are at the same time very certain, that worms do exist abundantly in many animals without at all disturbing their functions, or annoying them in the slightest degree; and we ought to consider all the creatures rather as the concomitants than the causes of disease.\"\n\n2. Trichuris.\n\nBody round, elastic, and variously twisted; head much thicker than the other part, furnished with a slender, extensible proboscis; tail long, capillary, and tapering to a fine point.\n\nBody above slightly crenate, smooth beneath, and very finely streaked on the fore part. Vid. fig. 5. and 6.\n\nThe body, when full grown, equals in breadth the one-fifteenth of an inch. In length the whole worm measures nearly two inches, two-thirds of which are tail, hence the French call it le ver à queue.\n\nThe large extremity of the trichuris is the head, out of which proceeds a kind of proboscis, not always visible, for the animal has the power of ejecting and drawing within itself this instrument at pleasure.\n\nThe body may be said to begin at the basis of the proboscis; it is the thickest part of the worm, and the most so at the extremity, where the proboscis is received. It gradually diminishes in size as it proceeds, and forms about one-third of its length.\n\nThe tail commences where the body terminates. It is twice as long as the body, and appears like a fine hair, gradually becoming smaller, and at length terminates in a very fine point.\n\nUpwards of twenty have been seen in some faeces of a child six years old, and according to the account of Blumenbach, they are, in general, in considerable number.\n\nWrisberg, Blumenbach, and others, have found these worms in the intestineum rectum, in the inferior part of the ileum, and also in the jejunum, mixed with their pulchaceous contents. They have seldom, if ever, been seen after death, but in the cæcum. In colour it resembles the ascaris vermicularis.\n\nGoeze has given a drawing of a female trichuris, and says it has no proboscis, which he supposes to be the male organ of generation; but as there is no material difference in the visceræ of particular individuals, Dr Hooper is inclined to doubt the fact.\n\nThis curious and singular animal is supplied, like the foregoing genus, with annular muscles, cutis, and cuticle.\n\nThe proboscis, which is undoubtedly the head of the worm, appears to be formed of a transparent substance, and contains a canal which is continued through the pulpy or funnel-like portion to the stomach and intestine.\n\nThe stomach and intestine are formed by a long canal, which proceeds in a direct line from the head to the very extremity of the worm. It is largest at its beginning, and continues of the same size throughout the body of the animal; and when arrived at the place where the tail commences, it suddenly becomes considerably less in diameter, and terminates in the anus.\n\nThe remaining viscus, or ovarium, is a convoluted canal, similar to that of the female vermicular ascaris, but is seldom found embracing the intestinal tube. The contents of this canal are ovula and a limpid fluid. There have seldom been seen any young worms.\n\nBesides the above species, five others have been de-mammali-scribed; viz. T. equi, found in the intestines of the um horde; april, in the boar; muris, in the mouse; vulpis, in the fox; and lacerta, in the lacerta apus.\n\n3. Filaria.\n\nBody round, filiform, equal, and quite smooth; mouth dilated, with a roundish concave lip.\n\nThe most important species of this genus is the F. medinensis, or guinea worm. Gmelin has arranged it or gui-the animal as a filaria, though Linnæus makes it a spe-nea worm. Species of gordius, in which he is followed by Brugiere and Barbut. Mr Bingley, in his Animal Biography, chooses to consider it as the same with the furia infer- nalis of Linnæus, a species to be mentioned by and bye. The French call it dragonneau, and the older medical writers, dracunculus. It is characterized by having the body entirely of a pale yellow colour. It inhabits both the Indies and the coast of Guinea, and is said commonly to make its appearance in the morning dew. It enters the feet and other exposed parts of the slaves, and occasions very troublesome symptoms.\n\nIt attacks most parts of the body; but is generally confined to the lower extremities, particularly to the feet and ankles. The disease is more painful and dangerous when seated in parts thinly covered with flesh, such as near the joints, tendons, and ligaments, and less so in muscular parts. It is always difficult to extract the worm from the ankles, tarsus, and metatarsus, and sometimes impossible from the toes. The consequences frequently are, tedious suppurations, contractions of the tendons, diseased joints, and gangrene. When pulled, the worm often excites a pain which it is not easy to describe, and which, in these parts, is extremely exquisite. It seems to attach itself to the nerves, ligaments, and tendons, and when pulled even with the slightest force, excites excruciating pain. The track of the animal appears to be for the most part con-\nSpecies, fined to the cellular membrane, and probably seldom extends deeper, or penetrates into the interstices of the mucilages.\n\nThe disease produced by this animal is a species of inflammation, which sometimes is very troublesome, and now and then is said to terminate in mortification. The worm sometimes appears at first like a hair, and becomes thicker as it is drawn from below the skin. It generally has a sharp point, and is otherwise all of the same thickness. It may sometimes be felt below the skin, like the string of a violin. Various causes are assigned for the generation of this worm, but in the countries where it is usually found, it is thought to be generated by drinking impure water. It is more probable that it infatuates itself from without.\n\nThe method commonly employed for extracting this animal is, to search for its extremity in the inflamed part, where there is usually an ulcer, and this is to be drawn out gently, and wrapt round a piece of linen rag, when the pulling is continued very gently till the worm makes so much resistance that there is great danger of breaking it, an accident which is said to be attended with very bad consequences, as the remaining part of the worm becomes more irritating, and produces a more violent degree of inflammation. When no more will easily come away, the part already extracted, rolled round the rag, is left to dry, the part covered from the air, and the operation is repeated occasionally till the whole worm is withdrawn.\n\nFour species of filaria are found in some of the mammalia, viz. F. equi, in the cellular membrane of the horse; leonis, in the lion; martis in the martin; and leporis, in the hare.\n\nFive infest birds, viz. F. falconis, the hawk; strigis, the owl; cornicis, the crow; ciconiae, the stork; and gallinae, the intestines of poultry.\n\nThe following infest perfect insects, viz.\n\nF. scarabaei, the scarabaeus semitaurus; filphae, in the filpha obfusca; carabi, in the carabus; grylli, in the cricket, and monoculi, in the monoculus apus.\n\nThirteen are found in the larva of various species of insects.\n\nThere are about 28 species of this genus distinguished in the Systema Naturæ.\n\n4. Uncinaria.\n\nBody filiform, elastic, the fore part obscurely tuberculate, with membranaceous angular lips; tail of the female ending in a fine point, of the male armed with two culpitate hooks inclosed in a pellucid vehicle.\n\nOf this genus there are only two species; viz. melis, found in the intestines of the badgers; and vulpis, in those of the fox.\n\n5. Scolex.\n\nBody gelatinous, variouly shaped, broadish on the fore part and pointed behind; sometimes linear and long, sometimes wrinkled and short, round, flexuous, or depressed; the head protrusive and retractile.\n\nThis genus also contains two species; viz. pleurohectidis, and lophii, both found in several species of fish.\n\n6. Ligula.\n\nBody linear, equal, long; the fore part obtuse; the hind part acute, with an impressed dorsal future.\n\nThere are two species of this genus, viz. intestinalis and abdominalis, infesting several varieties of fish.\n\n7. Linguatula.\n\nBody depressed, oblong; mouth placed before, surrounded with four papillæ.\n\nOf this genus there is only one species, viz. ferrata, found in the lungs of the hare.\n\n8. Strongylus.\n\nBody round, long, pellucid, glabrous; the fore part globular, truncate, with a circular aperture fringed at the margin; the hind part of the female entire and pointed, of the male dilated into loose, distant, pellucid membranes.\n\nThere are two species, viz. equinus, found in great numbers in the intestines of the horse, and ovinus in those of sheep.\n\n9. Echinorhynchus.\n\nBody round; proboscis cylindrical, retractile, and crowned with hooked pricks.\n\nThis is a very numerous genus, and is found in a great variety of animals, generally in their intestines, to which they are found very firmly fixed, often remaining on the same spot during the whole life of the animal. They are commonly gregarious, and are to be distinguished from the taenia, to be presently described, by their having the body round, and destitute of joints.\n\nFour species infest the mammalia, viz. E. phocaæ, found in great numbers in the intestines of the harp and lium, rough seal, so as sometimes nearly to devour them; tubifer, in the stomach of the harp seal; gigas, in swine, especially those kept in styæ; and baleneæ, in the intestines of the whale.\n\n14 infest birds, viz. E. buteonis, the buzzard; scopis, avium, in the strix scopo; aluconis, in the strix aluco; strigis, in the tawny owl; pici, in various species of picus borealis, in the cider duck; bochadis, in the common duck; anatis, in the velvet duck; mergi, in the mergus minutus; alceæ, in the auk; ardeæ, and gazeæ, in the ardea alba, or white heron; vanillæ, in the lapwing, and merulæ, in the blackbird and tree sparrow.\n\nTwo infest reptiles, viz. E. raneæ, the frog; and salamandæ, the salamander.\n\n28 infest fish; viz.

There are in all about 48 species.\n\nHæruca.\n\nBody round, the fore part two-necked, and surrounded with a single row of prickles; proboscis none.\n\nThere is only one species, viz. H. muris, found in the intestines of the mouse.\n\nCucullanus.\n\nBody sharp, pointed behind, and obtuse before; mouth orbicular, with a striate hood.\n\nThere are eight species, three of which are found in various mammalia, viz. C. talpae, and ocreatus in the mole; and muris in the mouse.\n\nOne infects birds, viz.\n\nC. buteonis, commonly found in the buzzard.\n\nOne, viz.\n\nC. ranae, is found in the intestines of the frog.\n\nSeveral varieties under the common name of lacustris, and two others, called alcaroides, and murinus, are found in various species of fish.\n\nCaryophyllaeus.\n\nBody round; mouth dilated and fringed.\n\nThere is only one species, called caryophyllaeus piscium, found in various species of fishes.\n\nFasciola.\n\nBody flatfish, with an aperture or pore at the head, and generally another at a distance beneath, seldom a single one.\n\nCuvier remarks, that the body of the fasciola is extremely flat. They appear to be hermaphrodite, and are oviparous. They are found in almost every species of animals.\n\nOne is found in man, though rarely, viz. fasciola hominis.\n\nTwelve in various species of the mammalia, viz. vulpis, in the intestines of the fox; putorii, in those of the polecat; melis, in those of the badger; vespertilionis, in the intestines of the long-eared bat; * hepatica, in the livers of sheep; boun, in those of cattle; porcorum, in the liver of swine; apri, in that of the boar; cervi, in that of deer; equi, in the liver of horses; and elaphi, in the stomach of the stag.\n\nOf these, the most important is the fasciola hepatica, or fluke, which is so common in the liver of sheep, in which it is supposed to be the principal cause of the rot. — This species is about an inch long, broadest on the fore-part, which is furnished with a large mouth. It terminates in a tube; the back is marked with a row of about eight longitudinal furrows. It is generally found fixed by two points, one at one extremity, and another at about the middle of the abdomen. It bears some resemblance to the feed of the common gourd, whence it is often called the gourd worm.\n\nThe opinion of flukes being the cause of the rot, has been ably controverted by several writers, especially by Dr Harrison. On this subject, see the article Farifry, No. 526. This opinion is supposed to be corroborated by a circumstance related in the first volume of the Monthly Magazine, page 101. of a jelly-like substance being found among the grubs, in a pasture that was notorious for rotting sheep. This substance bore a striking resemblance to the flukes found in the liver of rotten sheep; but we are afterwards told, that having been walked into a ditch, and attended to daily, it was, in process of time transformed into a small snail, with an ash-coloured spiral shell. It is therefore probable that it was not flukes; and indeed there is no well authenticated instance of these animals having been found out of the bodies of sheep, except when it could be proved, that they had been vomited by those animals.\n\nNine species of fasciola are found in birds, viz.\n\nF. bilis, in the gall duct of the eagle; butonis, in the buzzard; milvi and strigis, in the intestines of the kite; puflila, found in the thorax of the strix alba; anatis, in the duck; anferis, in the goose; gruis in the crane, and ardea, in the bittern.\n\nThree species infest reptiles, viz.\n\nF. salamandri, the salamander; ranae, the common frog, and uncinulata, the esculent frog.\n\n21 inhabit various kinds of fish, viz.\n\nF. Binodis, diticha, anguillae, scabra, eglefni, blen-piscium, nii, scorpi, platefex, lucioperce, percae, lugena, clavata, varica, eriocis, farionis, trutta, umblae, lucii, halecis, * bramae, jefis.\n\nOne, viz.\n\nF. loliginis, inhabits the sepia loligo, or cuttle fish.\n\nTænia.\n\nBody usually flat, and composed of numerous articulations; head with four orifices for suction, which are seated a little below the mouth; mouth terminal, continued by a short tube into two ventral canals, and generally crowned with a double series of retractile hooks.\n\nThe species of this genus, which are very numerous, are distributed into three sections, according to the situation which they inhabit in various animals, &c.\n\nA. Found in other parts besides the intestines, and furnished with a vehicle behind.\n\nThe species of this section are commonly known to medical writers by the name of hydatids, from the bladders, of which they are chiefly composed, being filled with a watery fluid.\n\nThe following inhabit various species of mammalia; viñeralis T. viñeralis, piliform, inclosed in a vehicle, broad on or hydathore part, and pointed behind.—Found in the liver, lids, placenta, kidneys, fats containing dropical fluids, and other morbid tumours in man.\n\nThere is no gland in the human body in which hydatids are so frequently found as the liver, except the kidneys, where they are still more common. Hydatids of the liver are usually found in a cyst, which is frequently of considerable size, and is formed of very firm materials,\nSpecies materials, so as to give to the touch almost the feeling of cartilage. This cyst, when cut into, is obviously laminated, and is much thicker in one liver than another. In some livers, it is not thicker than a thimble, and in others, it is near a quarter of an inch in thickness. The laminae which compose it are formed of a white matter, and on the inside there is a lining of a pulpy substance, like the coagulable lymph. In a cyst may be found one hydatid, or a greater number of them. They lie loose in the cavity, swimming in a fluid; or some of them are attached to the side of the cyst. They consist of a round bag, which is composed of a white, semi-opaque, pulpy matter, and contain a fluid capable of coagulation. Although the common colour of hydatids be white, yet they are seen occasionally of a light amber. The bag of the hydatid consists of two laminae, and possesses a good deal of contractile power. In one hydatid, this coat or bag is much thicker and more opaque than in another, and even in the same hydatid different parts of it will often differ in thickness. On the inside of a hydatid, smaller ones are sometimes found, which are commonly not larger than the heads of pins, but sometimes they are even larger than a gooseberry. These are attached to the larger hydatid, either at scattered irregular distances, or so as to form small clutters; and they are also found floating loose in the liquor of the larger hydatids. Hydatids of the liver are often found unconnected with each other; but sometimes they have been said to inclose each other in a series, like pill-boxes. The most common situation of hydatids of the liver, is in its substance, and inclosed in a cyst; but they are occasionally attached to the outer surface of the liver, hanging from it, and occupying more or less of the general cavity of the abdomen.*\n\nAnother species called cellulosa, is found in the cellular membrane of man.\n\nThe following infect others of the mammalia, viz. T. finise, found in the diaphragm of the ape; vesperitionis, in the liver of the bat; vulpis in the fox; putorii, in the pole-cat; urin, in the bear; gulonis, in the glutton; hydatigena, in various species of rat; murina, in the liver of the mouse; cordata, in mice and hares; piliformis, in the liver of hares; utricularis, in the gravid uterus of the same animal; ferarum, in deers and antelopes; caprina, in the goat; ovilla, in the liver and omentum of sheep; cerebralis, within the skull of sheep, constituting the disease called flurdy or turn-sick; (see Farriery, No. 521.) vervecina, in the peritoneum of fat sheep; granulosa, in the liver of sheep; bovina, in cattle; apri, in the boar; globosa, chiefly found in the bowels of swine; and pinna, in the cellular substance of swine.\n\nTwo infect reptiles, viz.\nT. salamandri, the salamander; and serpentinum, in various serpents.\n\nOne viz.\nT. truttae, is found in the liver of the trout.\n\nThe origin and real nature of hydatids are not fully ascertained. There is no doubt at all, that the hydatids in the livers of sheep are animalcules; they have been often seen to move when taken out of the liver, and put into warm water; and they retain this power of motion for a good many hours after a sheep has been killed. The analogy is great between hydatids in the liver of a sheep, and in that of a human subject. In both they are contained in strong cysts, and in both they consist of the same white pulpy matter. There is undoubtedly some difference between them in simplicity of organization; the hydatid in the human liver being a simple, uniform bag, and the hydatid in that of the sheep having a neck and mouth appended to the bag. This difference need be no considerable objection to the opinion above stated. Life may be conceived to be attached to the most simple form of organization. In proof of this, hydatids have been found in the brains of sheep, resembling almost exactly those in the human liver, and which have been seen to move, and therefore are certainly known to be animalcules. The hydatids of the human liver indeed, have not, as far as we know, been found to move when taken out of the body and put into warm water; were this to have happened, no uncertainty would remain.\n\nAn excellent paper on the subject of hydatids, by Dr John Hunter, is contained in the Medical and Chirurgical Transactions.\n\nB. Having no terminal vehicle, and found only in the intestines of other animals.\n\nThis section comprehends the teniae properly so called, or tape-worms, which are the most troublesome of all the species that inhabit the intestinal canal. Of these, the following two species that are confined to man, merit our particular attention.\n\nArticulations long and narrow, with marginal mouths, folium, one on each joint, and generally alternate; ovaries arborescent. Vida fig. 7. and 8.\n\nThis species is frequently bred in the intestines of the inhabitants of Germany, and occasionally, but rarely, in those of the inhabitants of Great Britain. It consists of a great many distinct portions, which are connected together so as to assume a jointed appearance; these joints are commonly of a very white colour, but are occasionally brownish, which depends on a fluid of this colour that is found in their vessels. The worm is usually very long, extending often many yards, and seldom passes entire from the bowels. This circumstance has prevented the extremities of the tenia from being often seen.\n\nBoerhaave mentions his having met with a tenia cells in length, and Pliny says he has seen them upwards of 30 feet long. According to Dr Hooper, the exact length depends upon the manner in which the death of the animal has been occasioned. If expelled by irritating medicines, it will not be so long by nearly one-half as if its death had been occasioned by emollients; as in the former instance it would be very much contracted, but in the latter very much relaxed.\n\nThe head of this tenia is somewhat of a square form with a narrowed projection forwards; in the middle of this projecting part, there is a distinct circular aperture around the edge of which grow curved-shaped processes. Near the angles of the square edge of the head, are situated four round projecting apertures at equal distances from each other; this head is placed upon a narrow jointed portion of the worm, of considerable length, and which gradually spreads itself into the broader joints, of which the body of the worm is composed.\n\nThe body of the tenia consists of thin, flat, pretty long joints, on one edge of which there is a projection,\nwith a very obvious aperture. In the same worm some of these joints appear considerably longer than others; this probably depends on one joint being contracted, while another is relaxed. The apertures which we have just mentioned are generally placed on the edge of the contiguous joints; but this is not uniformly the case; they are sometimes placed on the same edges of two, or even several contiguous joints. When these joints are examined attentively, there are frequently seen, in each of them, vessels filled with a brownish fluid, and disposed in an arboreal form. Around the edges of each joint, there is also a distinct serpentine canal. The last joint of a tenia resembles very much a common joint rounded off at its extremity, and without any aperture.\n\nThe joints of this species are very easily separated from each other whilst the animal is alive. This separation is effected either by the peristaltic motion of the intestines, or perhaps spontaneously. Each joint thus detached from the mother worm, has the power of retaining, for a considerable time, its living principle, and is called, from its resemblance to the seed of the gourd, *vermis cucurbitinus*. This phenomenon has given rise to many warm disputes; several authors have denied their being portions of tenia, and have affirmed that they were distinct worms. The separated joints do not appear capable of retaining their situation for any length of time, but are soon forced down the intestinal tube, and at length creep out, or are expelled per anus. There are several cases faithfully recorded, where the persons, if their veracity can be depended upon, (and they had no interest in deceiving) have voided, during the time they were troubled with the worm, upwards of fifteen thousand.\n\nThis worm is not in general solitary, as is commonly supposed, for several of them have been seen coming away at the same time.\n\nThey are always found in the small intestines, commonly occupying their whole extent.\n\nThe motion of these worms is undulatory. The first joint towards the head contracts; the succeeding ones follow successively, and the worm is at length drawn considerably forwards, exactly in the same manner in which the earth-worm is seen to move, only considerably slower. By this means the food taken in at the mouth of the worm is very soon conveyed all along the alimentary canal, and may sometimes be seen moving along with considerable rapidity.\n\nThere can be very little doubt, that the tenia is hermaphrodite. The ova are observed to be vivipara, subservient to the propagation of the species, as it can be proved, that they give exit to the ovula.\n\nArticulations short and broader than those of the last, with a mouth in the centre of each joint; ovaries fillate round the mouth.\n\nIt is composed of a head, a chain of articulations, and a tail formed of a round joint, as in the last species. The head is similar to that of the other species.\n\nThe joints are more uniform in their appearance than those of the tenia folium. They are considerably more broad than long, and their ova are not placed on the margin, but in the middle of the flattened surface, and only on one side. We have never seen them change their side, but have always observed them on the same side throughout the whole extent of the worm.\n\nIn every other respect the description of this species agrees with that above given of the other, except that the ovaria are in the form of a rose or star, hence they are called by some writers, *ovaria rostellata*, and others, *ligamenta rostellata*; and that the transverse canals by which there is in the other species a communication between the longitudinal canals are in this wanting.\n\nThe number of this species is uncertain, but there are seldom more than three or four.\n\nIts length is commonly less than that of the last species, seldom exceeding five yards.\n\nIt is always situated in the small intestines, and it appears that it feeds on no other food than pure chyle.\n\nIt is for the most part of a darker hue than the former species, though they have been seen as white as milk.\n\nThis species is very seldom met with in this country, but is endemic in Switzerland and Ruffia, and very common in Germany and some other parts of Europe.\n\nFor a more particular account of the anatomical structure of teniae, we refer our readers to a paper by Mr Carlisle, in the second volume of the Lin. Trans. and Dr Hooper's paper in the fifth volume of the Memoirs of the Medical Society of London. For an account of the symptoms produced by these worms and the affections, and the method of treatment, see Worms, Medicine Index; and for the remedies employed in these cases, see Anthelmintics, Materia Medica Index.\n\nThe following species inhabit various mammalia, viz:\n\nCateniformis, of which there are seven varieties mammalia found in the dog, the wolf, the fox, the cat, the squirrel, red, and the dormouse; cucurbitina, in the dog; ferrata, in the dog and cat; maniliformis, in the cat; lineata, in the wild cat; mutteae, in the weasel, martin, and polecat; filamentosa, in the intestines of the mole; erinacei, in the hedge-hog; straminea, in the mus cricetus; magna and quadriloba, in the horse; and caprina, in the goat.\n\nThe following infect birds, viz:\n\nPithecus, in the pithecus brachyurus; cornicis, in the crow; serpentiformis, in crows, rooks, and magpies; caryocactus, in the nut-cracker; crateriformis, in the spotted wood-pecker; torqueta, in the duck; fecopacis and filum, in the woodcock; infundibuliformis, in the buzzard, ducks, and poultry; sturni, in the starling; paetris, in the sparrow; and hirundinis, in the martin swallow.\n\nOne, viz:\n\nT. Nodulosus, infects various species of fish.\n\nC Head unarmed with hooks.\n\nOf this section the following infect the mammalia, mammalia viz:\n\nDentata, sometimes said to be found in mankind; phoca, in the great seal; baillaris, in the mole; pecinata, in the hare and rabbit; ovina, in sheep; equina in the horse; and suis, in the Ethiopian hog.\n\nThe following are found in birds, viz:\n\nGlobifera, in the buzzard, lanner, and thrush; perata, in the buzzard; flagellum, in the kite; candelabra, in the Aluco owl; crenata, in the spotted woodpecker; lanceolata, in the merganser and smew; fetigera,\nSpecies, Intestina.\n\nGera, and anseris, in the goose; anatis, in various species of duck; lavis, in the duck, &c.; cuneata, in various species; aleu, in the auk; torde, in the razor-bill; tarda, in the bustard; lineae in partridges; and maculata, in the red-wing.\n\nOne, viz.;\n\nBatis, is found in the toad and salamander.\n\nThe following infest fish, viz.\n\nAnguillae, in the cel; rugosa, in the cod; scorpii, in the armed bullhead; percæ, in the sea perch; erythrine, in the Norway perch; ceruæ, in the ruffe; folida and galeroetel in the stickle-back; fluri, in the silurus glanis; falmonis, in the salmon; freolichii, in the falmo wellmanni; rectangulum, in the barbel; torula, in the cyprinus jefes; and laticeps, in the bream.\n\nGmelin, in his edition of the Systema Naturæ, enumerates 86 species of the tænia.\n\nFuria.\n\nBody linear, equal, filiform, and ciliate on each side, with a single row of reflected prickles pressed close to the body.\n\nThere is only one species, viz. infernalis.\n\nFrom the account given of this animal in the Syst. Nat., it appears to be a very formidable creature. It inhabits the extensive marshy plains of Bothnia; is about an inch long, and of a pale red or brown colour, generally with a black tip. It mounts up the edges and shrubs, and being driven by the wind through the air, enters through the skin of men and horses in such parts as are exposed and situated obliquely; leaving a black mark where it had entered. It first excites a sensation like the prick of a needle, which is followed by violent itching and acute pain. An inflammation and commonly gangrene is the consequence, attended with fever, faintings and delirium, and frequently terminating in a short time in death, unless the worm is speedily extracted, which is a work of considerable difficulty. The part where the worm entered is to be scarified, and anointed with oil of birch, or covered with a poultice of curds or cheese.\n\nGordius.\n\nBody round, equal, filiform, and smooth. Body pale brown (or yellowish) with dark extremities. Water hair-worm.\n\nThis worm is about the thickness of a horse's hair, and when full grown, is ten or twelve inches in length. Its skin is somewhat gloomy, and of a pale yellowish white, except the head and tail, which are black. It is common in our fresh waters, and particularly in such where the bottom is composed of soft clay, through which it passes as a fish does through water.\n\nIts popular name arose from the idea that it was produced from the hair of horses and other animals that were accidentally dropped into the water; an idea that is yet prevalent among the lower classes of people.\n\nIts Linnaean name of gordius originated in the habit that it has of twisting itself into such peculiar contortions as to resemble a complicated Gordian knot. In this state it often continues for a considerable time, and then slowly disengaging itself, extends its body to the full length. Sometimes it moves in the water with a tolerable quick undulatory motion like that of a leech; and at other times its motions are the most slow and languid imaginable. When the water in which it swims happens to be dried up, it soon loses every appearance of life; the flabby body shrivels, and it may be kept in this state a considerable time. But whenever it is put into water its body soon reassumes its former appearance; in less than half an hour it begins to move, and in a few minutes more it is as active and lively as ever. How long it may be preserved in this dried state without losing its life, or how often it might admit of being revived, has not been ascertained. When kept in a vessel of water, it will sometimes appear motionless and as if dead for several hours, and afterwards will resume its vigour, and seem as healthy as before.\n\nIt is a very remarkable circumstance, that its bite, which it sometimes inflicts on being taken out of the water, has been known to produce the complaint called a whitlow. This is mentioned by Linnaeus as a popular opinion in Sweden, and it has since his time been confirmed by various other persons.\n\nThis gordius is sometimes found in the earth as well as in water, and particularly in gardens of a clayey soil, after rain.\n\nBesides this species four others are enumerated, viz.\n\nArgillaceus, filum, lacteus, and arenarius; but it is probable that the first of these, which is said to pierce through clay, to give passage to water, is merely a variety of the aquaticus.\n\nHirudo.\n\nBody oblong, truncate at both ends, unarmed and cartilaginous, moving by dilating the head and tail, and contracting itself into an arch.\n\nElongated, of an olive black colour, with six yellow medicina-ferruginous lines above, and yellow spots below. Medici-lis-nal leech.—This species is generally two or three inches long, when lying in its natural state, though it is capable of very great dilatation. The body is composed of numerous annular wrinkles, which may be seen projecting, and by which the animal can expand or contract its body at pleasure. The head is smaller than the tail. This latter terminates in a circular mouth or sucker, which, when applied to any substance easily adheres; probably by the animal's drawing up the middle, and thereby exhausting the air below. By means of the tail it fattens itself with ease and security, while it extends the other parts of its body in any direction; and it is so firmly fixed, that it can move about without any danger of being carried away by the current. When the animal is desirous of changing its place, it extends its body forwards, fixes its head in the same manner as it did its tail, which latter it then loosens, draws up, and then fattens near its head, so as to form a fresh point from which to continue its movements.\n\nIts head is furnished with three teeth, of a substance resembling cartilage, which are so situated as to converge when the animal bites, and to leave a triangular mark on the skin. These teeth are so strong that by means of them the animal can pierce the skin of an ox or a horse, as well as that of man; and through the holes which it forms, it sucks the blood. This appears to be done by contracting the muscles of its throat, so\nas to make the blood rush through the vacuum formed above the wound, into the stomach of the leech. This stomach is a kind of membranaceous skin, divided into small cells. If suffered to retain the blood which it has sucked, this is said to remain in the stomach of the animal, for months together, almost without coagulating, and to afford support to the animal during the whole of that time. It appears to pass off through the pores of the skin by transpiration, the matter fixing on the surface of the body, and afterwards coming off in small filaments. Mr Bingley affirms in proof of this, that if a leech be immersed in oil (where it will keep alive for several days), and afterwards put into water, a slough will be seen to loosen from its skin, exactly of the shape of the animal.\n\nIt is viviparous, and produces only one at a time, which is commonly in the month of July. It inhabits clear running waters, but may be kept for a considerable time in vessels partly filled with water, which should be changed occasionally, when it becomes putrid. In general, if the number of leeches kept together is not great, the water need not be changed oftener than once a month in winter, and once every fortnight in summer; and we have known instances where several leeches have, when neglected, lived for several months in the same water. If, however, the number be large, they frequently die, which is thought to be owing to their fighting and killing each other.\n\nWhen leeches are to be applied for the purpose of extracting blood from any part of the body, the most lively, and those of moderate size, should be selected for that purpose; and they should be suffered to remain out of the water in a covered vessel for some time before they are applied. The best method of applying them is, to put them within a hollow glass tube, ground smooth at one end, open at both extremities, and bended so as to admit of its being applied to any part occasionally. The leech will commonly soon fix, but the skin to which it is to be applied should always be washed thoroughly clean, and should be freed from hair. If the animal is averse to fix, it may often be enticed to do so by rubbing the part of the skin with a little fresh cream, or new milk. When the leech has gorged itself with blood, it commonly drops off spontaneously; but if it should be too long in quitting its hold, it may be speedily made to do so by inserting a little salt, pepper, vinegar, or other acid substance, between the margin of its head and the skin. As a leech, after it has been used for drawing blood, will not, for a long time, suck again, if suffered to retain the blood it has drawn, various methods have been contrived to evacuate the blood. The common method is, to sprinkle a little salt upon its mouth, which commonly makes it disgorge a great quantity of blood; but we are not certain whether more animals are not killed in this way than by suffering the blood to remain. The most effectual, and we believe the safest method of making them disgorge the blood is, to lay hold of them by the tail, and strip them between the fingers, after which they should be put into clean water.\n\nThe best method of conveying leeches to a distance is, to put them into a strong, wide-mouthed glass bottle, and to put with them a piece of sponge thoroughly wetted with water, tying a piece of bladder pricked with holes over the mouth of the bottle.\n\nIt is said that leeches, when kept in bottles, will become very restless just before a change of weather is about to take place. This may be the case, but from many observations which we have made, we believe that they afford very uncertain presages of the state of the atmosphere.\n\nElongated, of an olive brown colour, with an ochre-yellow marginal band. Horse-leech.\n\nThis is larger than the former; its skin is smooth and glossy; its back of a darkish colour, and the belly of a yellowish green; its body is depressed. It inhabits stagnant waters. It is to be carefully distinguished from the former species, as it will not answer the purposes of surgery.\n\nBesides these two species, the following are described in the Systema Naturae, viz.; indica, lineata, oculata, stagnalis, complanata, viridis, heteroclyta, geometra, telesata, marginata, grossa, hippoglossi, crenata, muricata, and branchiata. In all 17 species.\n\n18. Lumbricus.\n\nBody round, annulate; generally with an elevated, fleshy belt near the head, and commonly rough, with minute concealed prickles, placed longitudinally, and furnished with a lateral aperture.\n\nThere are 16 species of this genus, viz.; terrestris, marinus, vernicularis, variegatus, tubifex, lineatus, ciliatus, tubicola, echeirus, thallina, edulis, oxyurus, fragilis, armiger, corretus, labellaris.\n\nOf these, the only one of which we shall make particular mention, is the terrestris, common earth-worm, or dew-worm. Body red, with eight rows of prickles.\n\nThis worm has neither bones, brains, eyes, nor feet. It has a number of breathing holes situated along its back, near each ring. Its heart is placed near the head, and may be observed to beat with a very distinct motion. The body is formed of small rings, furnished with a set of muscles that enable it to act in a sort of spiral direction; and by this means it is capable, in the most complete manner, of creeping on the earth, or penetrating into its substance. Mr Bingley explains the motion of these animals by that of a wire wound about a cylinder, where, when one end is drawn on and held fast, the other, upon being loosed, will immediately follow. These muscles enable the worm to contract or dilate its body with great force. The rings are each armed with small, stiff, sharp prickles, which the animal is able to open out or close upon its body; and from beneath the skin there is secreted a slimy matter, which, by lubricating the body, greatly facilitates its passage through the earth.\n\nIt is of consequence to point out the difference between this worm and the Acanthocephalus, or long-headed round worm of the human intestines, described at page 338, as they have been supposed to be merely varieties of the same animal. The common earth-worm has its extremities much blunter than those of the intestinal; coiled, its mouth consists of a small, longitudinal fissure, situated on the under surface of a small rounded head, there being no appearance of the three vehicles to evident in the acanthocephalus. On the under surface of the earth-worm there is a large semilunar fold of skin, into which the head retreats; but this is entirely wanting in the acanthocephalus; the anus of the earth-worm opens at the very extremity.\nSpecies. tremity of the tail, and [not as in the alcaris, at a considerable distance from the tail. The alcaris also wants the transverse rugae which are so strongly marked in the earth-worm, as well as the broad yellowish band by which the body of the latter is surrounded.\n\nThe internal structure of these two species of worms is also extremely different. In the earth-worm, there is a large and complete stomach, consisting of two cavities; and the intestinal canal in the latter is likewise larger, and more formed into sacculi than the alcaris. The parts subservient to generation in these two species of worms differ very much from each other; in the alcaris there is a distinction of sex, the parts of generation being different in the male and in the female; in the common earth-worm the organs of generation are the same in each individual, as this worm is hermaphrodite. The appearance, too, of the organs of generation, is extremely different at first sight in the one species of animal and the other. There is an oval mass situated at the anterior extremity of the earthworm, resembling a good deal the medullary matter of the brain.\n\nDew-worms, though in appearance a small and despicable link in the chain of nature, yet, if lost, might make a lamentable chasm. For, to say nothing of half the birds and some quadrupeds which are almost entirely supported by them, worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation (which would proceed but ill without them) by boring, perforating, and loosening the soil, and rendering it pervious to rains and the fibres of plants, by drawing straws and stalks of leaves and twigs into it; and most of all, by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps called worm-casts, which form a fine manure for grain and grass. Worms probably provide new soil for hills and slopes when the rain washes the earth away; and they affect slopes, probably to avoid being flooded.\n\nGardeners and farmers express their detestation of worms; the former, because they render their walks unsightly, and make them much work; and the latter, because they think worms eat their green corn. But these men would find, that the earth, without worms, would soon become cold, hard-bound, and void of fermentation, and consequently sterile; and besides, in favour of worms, it should be hinted that green corn, plants and flowers, are not so much injured by them as by many species of insects in their larva or grub-state, and by unnoticed myriads of those small shell-less snails called flugs, which silently and imperceptibly make amazing havoc in the field and garden.\n\n19. SIPUNCULUS.\n\nBody round and elongated; mouth cylindrical at the end, and narrower than the body; aperture at the side of the body warty.\n\nThere are two species; viz. S. * nudus and faccatus.\n\nBody covered with a close skin, and globular at the lower end. Naked tube worm.—This animal is about eight inches long, and nearly of a conical figure from head to tail, having the base usually about nine lines, and the other extremity about four lines in diameter. The broader part of the body is the head, and is furnished with a mouth, in which there is a tube made of a strong membrane, and armed with three fleshy-pointed papillae, about the size of a grain of millet. This trunk is at one end every where connected with the rim of the mouth, but is loose at the other end. It may be extended to the length of an inch, or entirely withdrawn at the pleasure of the animal, probably for the purpose of seizing its food, and carrying it to its mouth. When the tube is out of the mouth, the papillae are on the outside, but they occupy the inside of the mouth when the tube is within. Hence the food laid hold of by the disengaged part of the trunk cannot escape; as the further the trunk is drawn back into the mouth, it is arrested by so many more papillae, which like prongs are ready to detain it. At the distance of an inch and a half from the mouth there is an oblong aperture, surrounded with a prominent lip, and situated transversely.\n\nThe whole body of this animal is of a fallow white, inclining to a clay colour, and is adorned with deep streaks; some of which are longitudinal, and others circular. Sometimes this animal will extend itself to almost the length of a foot, while at other times it contracts into a very small volume, by enlarging the narrower portion of its body near the point, which is spherical.\n\nIt inhabits deep seas, from which it is never cast on the shore, but it sometimes enters the fishermen's nets along with their fish.\n\nBody covered with a loose skin, and rounded at the faccatus, lower end. Vid. fig. 9.\n\nThis animal differs little from the former, except in the loose skin in which the animal is enclosed as in a bag. It inhabits the American and Indian seas.\n\n20. PLANARIA.\n\nBody gelatinous, flatfish, with a double ventral pore; mouth terminal.\n\nThe animals comprehended under this genus nearly resemble the leeches, and like them live in fresh water. They are very numerous, but, as nothing remarkable is known respecting them, we shall merely enumerate their names.\n\nA. Without eyes.\n\nStagnatus, nigra, brunea, ciliata, gulo, punctata, flaccida, rolea, angulata, rubra, viridis, operculata, subulata, quadrangularis, bicornis, grisea, fulva, viridata.\n\nB. Having a single eye.\n\nGlaucia, lineata, niellans.\n\nC. Having two eyes.\n\nFuca, lactea, tonica, tentaculata, crenata, Lelluo, obscura, rostrata, atomata, cornuta, radiata, frigata, grossa, linearis, terrestris, tetragona, capitata, caudata, auriculata, filaris, lingua.\n\nD. Having three eyes.\n\nGefferensis.\n\nE. Having four eyes.\n\nMarmorata, candida, truncata.\nF. Having more than four eyes.\n\nTremellaris.\n\nThere are in all forty-two species.\n\nThis Order comprehends twenty genera, and about 406 species.\n\nSECT. II.\n\nORDER II. MOLLUSCA.\n\nWe have already, in the second part of the article ANATOMY, chap. viii., given a sufficient account of the general structure of the animals of this order, and of the several subdivisions of it, as given by Cuvier, to whose writings and those of La Marck, the lovers of natural history are chiefly indebted for the present state of our knowledge respecting these animals. Cuvier includes under the mollusca all those animals which inhabit shells, as well as those which are naked. The latter only can be considered here, and we shall chiefly confine ourselves to some of the more remarkable species.\n\n21. ACTINIA.\n\nBody oblong, cylindrical, fleshy, and contractile, fixed by the base; mouth terminal, expanfile, surrounded with numerous tentacula, and without any other aperture.\n\nThis genus comprehends most of those extraordinary animals which have been described under the title of animal flowers, sea-mary-golds, &c., an account of which has been already given under the article ANIMAL-Flower. We shall here therefore only enumerate the species, which are 23 in number; viz. rufa, * crassicornis, * plumosa, * anemonoides, judaica, * esteta, coccinea, undata, viduata, * truncata, nodosa, spectabilis, digitata, gigantea, alba, viridis, priapus, candida, bicornis, vulva, * caryophyllus, iris, ficella, puffila, * cereus, * bellis, * gemmacea, * melembryanthemum, sociata, alter, anemone, helianthus, * dianthus, calendula, doliolum, * maculata.\n\n22. CLAVA.\n\nBody fleshy, gregarious, club-shaped, and fixed by a round peduncle, having a single vertical aperture.\n\nThere is but one species; viz. parasitica; characterized by its having a whitish, pellucid peduncle, and an opaque red club that is covered with erect, conical, pellucid spines. It is found in the Baltic sea, upon sea weeds, shell-fish, and floating timber. It possesses the power of dilating and contracting the mouth.\n\n23. PEDICELARIA.\n\nBody soft, and seated on a rigid fixed peduncle, having a single aperture.\n\nThere are three species; viz. P. globifera, triphylla, and tridens, all which are found in the North seas, chiefly among the spines of echini.\n\n24. MAMMARIA.\n\nBody smooth, and without rays, having a single aperture.\n\nThere are three species; viz. M. mammilla, varia, Species, and globulus. Found also in the North seas and on the shores of Greenland.\n\n25. ASCIDIA.\n\nBody fixed, roundish, and appearing to issue from a sheath, having two apertures, generally placed near the upper extremity, one below the other.\n\nThere are about 35 species of Ascidia; viz. papillofa, gelatinosa, * intefinalis, quadridentata, * ruflca, echinata, mentula, venosa, prunum, conchilega, parallelogramma, virginea, canina, patula, alpina, leabra, orbicularis, corrugata, lepadiformis, complanata, tuberculum, villoa, clavata, pedunculata, * mammillaris, globularis, fusca, gelatina, crytallina, octodentata, patelliformis, pyura, aurantium, globularis, falciculata.\n\nOf these we shall describe only two, the papillofa, and the intefinalis.\n\nBody rough, and covered with scarlet tubercles.—papillofa.\n\nThis animal is generally about three inches long, and something less than two broad; its shape is oval. On the upper part it is furnished with two mammary protuberances, one of which is seated on the top of the body, and has an orifice in the form of a crois. The other is placed a little below the former, and has a triangular orifice opening transversely. The lips of either orifice are encompassed with several fæceous hairs, of a clay colour, and one line in length, but observing no regular order. The whole surface of the body is rough, being covered over with small knobs or oblong nipples of a scarlet colour. The extremity opposite to the organs, or the basis, is furnished with peduncles of various forms, by means of which this animal firmly adheres to rocks or other bodies, so that it cannot be forced from its situation without injuring the peduncles.\n\nThe skin, which is thick and hard like the hide of a quadruped, constitutes by far the greater part of the animal's bulk; and there is scarcely anything distinguishable within, except a small part that commences a little below the orifice of the upper papilla, from which it proceeds downwards, and is inserted into the lower orifice, having the appearance of an intestine. From the appearance of this organ, it is supposed that the upper orifice is the mouth, and the lower the anus. This species is not used for food, though some of them are said to be eatable.\n\nBody elongated, membranaceous, smooth, and whitish, appearing like the intestines of a quadruped.—If nalis, the membrane of which nearly the whole of this animal's body consists, be divided longitudinally, there appears another membranaceous canal descending from the upper organ, almost to the base, where it bends back, and proceeds towards the lower organ, into which it is inserted. This canal is commonly filled with a blackish fluid. These organs are sometimes strongly contracted, and at others as much relaxed. They do not appear like those of the former species, to be able to draw in and throw out the water.\n\nThe animals belonging to this genus have the power of squirting out the water they receive, as if from a fountain; and it is probable that they derive their nourishment from the animalcula which the water contains.\n\n26. SALPA.\n26. *SALPA.*\n\nBody long, floating, gelatinous, tubular, and open at each extremity, with an intestinal tube placed obliquely.\n\nThe outer covering of these animals has two openings, one very large, serving for the introduction of the water in which they live between their branchiae, and the other smaller, which appears to be the anus. They have no head or feet. They are found in all our seas. Many of the species are remarkable for the regularity which they observe in their mode of swimming. They are gregarious, and one always follows at the tail of another, in such a manner as to touch each other, and to form two lines, one above the other, each individual of the upper line being supported by two of the lower.\n\nThe species are arranged under two subdivisions.\n\nA. Furnished with an appendage.\n\nThis section contains four species; viz. maxima, pinata, democratica, and mucronata.\n\nB. Having no terminal appendage.\n\nThis section contains seven species; viz. punctata, confederata, fasciata, spho, africana, solitaria, and polyacra.\n\n27. *DAGYSA.*\n\nBody loose, floating, angular, tubular, and open at each extremity.\n\nThere is only one species of this genus; viz. notata, characterized as having the body marked at one end with a brown spot. It is about three inches long, and one thick, and is found in the sea on the coasts of Spain. These animals adhere to each other by their sides, and in other respects very nearly resemble those of the last genus.\n\n28. *PTEROTRACHIA.*\n\nBody detached, gelatinous, with a moveable fin at the abdomen or tail; eyes two, placed within the head.\n\nThere are four species; viz. coronata, hyalina, pulmonata, and aculeata.\n\n29. *DERRIS.*\n\nBody cylindrical, composed of articulations; mouth terminal, feelers two.\n\nThere is only one species; viz. *sanguinea*, which is found on the coast of Pembrokeshire.—This animal has a tapering body to a point behind, and is capable of great flexibility; it is covered with a transparent membranous coat, through which the internal parts are visible. The head is extended beyond the outer skin, and is less than the rest of the fore part of the body. The tentacula are white, and seated at the top of the head. The mouth consists of two lips, the upper one hooked and moveable, the lower one straight and fixed. It moves by an undulating motion of the whole body.\n\n30. *LIMAX.*\n\nBody oblong, creeping, with a fleshy kind of shield above, and a longitudinal flat disk beneath; aperture Limax placed on the right side within the shield; feelers four, situated above the mouth, with an eye at the tip of each of the larger ones.\n\nThis genus comprehends those animals which are commonly called flugs, or naked snails, which are well known to commit such ravages in our fields and gardens, especially in wet weather.\n\nThere are 15 species; viz. levis, *ater, albus, *rufus, *flavus, *maximus, hyalinus, *agreftis, cinctus, marginitatus, reticulatus, aureus, fulcus, tenellus, and *lanceolatus.\n\nThe most curious species of this genus seems to be *agreftis*, what has been called the spinning flug, which is a variety of the limax *agreftis*.—This animal is of a grayish white colour with a yellowish shield, and is commonly about three-fourths of an inch long. It inhabits woods and other shady places. The following account of it has been given by Mr Hoy, in the first volume of the Linnean Transactions.\n\nAbout the year 1789, Mr Hoy observed, in a plantation of Scotch firs, something hanging from one of the branches, which, as it seemed uncommon, he approached, and found it to be this animal. It was hanging by a single line or thread attached to its tail. This was upwards, very fine; but near the animal it became thicker and broader, till at length it exactly corresponded with the tail. The flug was about four feet below the branch, and nearly at the same distance from the ground; which it gradually approached at the rate of an inch in about three minutes. This rate, though slow, is not so much so as might be expected, considering that the animal is not furnished with any particular receptacle, as in some insects, for the gelatinous liquid from which its filken lines are formed. The line by which it descended was drawn from the slimy exudation gradually secreted from the pores that covered its whole body. A great degree of exertion seemed necessary to produce a sufficient supply of the liquid, and to force this towards the tail. It alternately drew back its head, and turned it as far as possible, first to one side and then to the other, as if thereby to press its sides, and thus promote secretion. This motion of the head in an horizontal direction made the whole body turn round; by which the line that would otherwise remained somewhat flat became round. This motion also, in addition to the weight of the animal, tended, no doubt, materially to lengthen the line.\n\nIn addition to Mr Hoy's account, Dr Latham observes, that the secretion from which the thread is formed, does not come from the back or sides of the animal, but from its under part. That it did not proceed from any orifice in the tail was evident, for in some instances the animal was suspended by the tip, and in others from the side full one-eighth of an inch from the tip. The flow of the viscid secretion towards the tail appeared to be excited by an undulating motion of the belly, similar to that of crawling.\n\nAfter these animals have spun for some time, their spinning power seems to be for a while lost, but in all\nall those on which experiments have been made, it has been recovered again by keeping them for a few hours among wet moss.\n\n31. LAPYLSIA.\n\nBody creeping, covered with reflected membranes, with a membranaceous shield on the back covering the lungs; aperture placed on the right side; vent above the extremity of the back; feelers four, resembling ears. Vid. fig. 10.\n\nAn animal of this genus has been called the sea-hare, a name which is derived from the ancients; and the animal to which it is given appears to have been known at a very early period, and perhaps on that account its history is obscured with many fabulous narrations.\n\nFisherfolk seem in all ages to have attributed some noxious properties to those marine animals which do not serve for the nourishment of man; and the writings of naturalists are still filled with the reports of these ignorant men respecting several productions of the sea, as the sea-nettle, star-fish, and in particular the sea-hare. These relations have been multiplied and prodigiously increased with respect to the marvellous, whenever the figure, the colour, or smell of the animal have anything extraordinary or forbidding in them, as is the case with the sea-hare. Hence we find a long list of noxious and afflicting properties attributed to this animal. Not only are its flesh, and the water in which it has been steeped, of a poisonous nature, but even its very aspect is deadly. A woman who would wish to conceal her pregnancy, cannot resist the sight of a female sea-hare, which produces nausea and vomiting, and finally miscarriage, unless a male of the same species, dried and salted, is given her to eat; for it is one of the superstitious ideas entertained by the common people in most countries, that every noxious species of animal carries within itself a remedy for the ill effects which it may occasion. It happens, indeed, unfortunately for the present story, that in the sea-hare there is no distinction of sex. If these animals in Italy (for the above stories are taken from Pliny) are so deadly to mankind, it is quite otherwise in the Indian seas; for there it is man who is such a deadly foe to the sea-hare, that he cannot take it alive, since it is destroyed by his very touch!\n\nThese ridiculous fables respecting an innocent animal, are still believed by many people, and others as ridiculous have been added to them. Mr Barbut relates that a sailor happening to take a lapylia in the Mediterranean, it gave him such instantaneous and excruciating pain as to cause an inflammation, and the poor man lost his arm! and so sensible are the fishermen of the poisonous quality of the mucus which oozes from its body, that they will not on any account touch it.\n\nIn an excellent memoir on the lapylia, contained in the 2d vol. of Annales de Museum National, Cuvier gives the following general description of the animals composing the genus.\n\nThey bear a considerable resemblance to the slugs; their body is oval, flattened below, so as to form a long and straight foot, and swelling out above; more or less pointed behind, and diminishing a little before, so as to form a sort of neck, that is susceptible of various degrees of elongation, and at whose extremity is situated the head.\n\nThe head is the only superior part that advances beyond the borders of the disc that forms the foot. The other borders of this disc are contracted, so as to form a kind of palliade, surrounding the sides and back part of the body. This fleshy wall is contracted and raised more or less, and is folded into numerous undulations at the pleasure of the animal, who can fold the one part over the other, or can cause them to separate, so as to give them all manner of shapes. Between the borders we perceive a part almost semicircular, attached only by the right side, entirely moveable like a fleshy cover, the border of which is flexible, and sometimes forms a sort of gutter, to conduct the water to the organs of breathing, which are in fact under this cover. At the posterior extremity of its attachment is the anus, and between the anterior extremity of the same attachment, and that which corresponds to the membranaceous border of the body on the right side, is a hole, through which are passed the eggs of the animal, and that peculiar liquor which has been regarded as poisonous. But besides this liquor, which is whitish, and is rarely voided, the animal produces another kind much more abundant, and of a very deep purple red.\n\nThe mouth is situated below the head lengthwise, and the anterior border of the head forms on each side a membranous production that is conical, compressed, capable of being more or less prolonged, and forms a tentaculum. Behind the head, further back, there is on each side another conical tentaculum, which the animal can elongate or shorten at pleasure, but which he cannot withdraw within the body, like the snail. The extremity of this is a little folded longitudinally into two parts, so as to resemble the external ear of a quadruped. Before the base of this organ is the eye, which seems nothing but a little black point.\n\nThe parts above described are common to all the lapyliae, but differ in the several species in proportion and colour.\n\nIn the last edition of the Systema Naturae, only two species of lapylia are mentioned; viz. depilans, which appears to be the original sea-hare mentioned by Pliny, and which owes its trivial name to the belief that the fetid liquor which it exudes is capable of taking off the hair from any part which it touches; and fasciata. Besides these, Cuvier enumerates and figures three others, viz. camelus, punctata, and alba.\n\n32. DORIS.\n\nBody creeping, oblong and flat beneath; placed below, on the fore-part; vent behind on the back, and surrounded by a fringe; feelers 2—4, seated on the upper part of the body in front, and retractile within their proper receptacles.\n\nThis genus is divided by Gmelin into two sections.\n\nA. Having four tentacula.\n\nOf this there are seven species; viz. fasciculata, minimata, radiata, pennata, peregrina, affinis, and * argo.\n\nB. Having two tentacula.\n\nOf this section there are 17 species; viz. * verrucosa,\nSpecies fa, clavigera, quadrilineata, papillofa, auriculata, laciniata, cervina, coronata, tetraqueta, * bilamellata, olivelata, muricata, pilofa, laevis, arboreifrons, frondosa, and stellata.\n\nIn a long and interesting memoir by Cuvier on the genus doris, printed in the 4th vol. of Annales de Muséum National, that celebrated naturalist shows that only seven of the species enumerated by Gmelin (viz. argo, stellata, bilamellata, laevis, olivelata, muricata, and pilofa), really belong to this genus, and that the rest should be arranged under other genera.\n\nCuvier admits thirteen species, six of them new; and distributes them into two sections.\n\na. Flat doris,\n\nComprehending ten species; viz. folia, scabra, maculofa, verrucosa, limbata, tuberculata, stellata, pilofa, tomentofa, and laevis.\n\nb. Prismatic doris,\n\nThree species; viz. lacera, atro-marginata, and pulchrola.\n\nWe regret that our limits will not permit us to translate the valuable observations contained in this memoir, to which we refer the reader for the description of the above species, and of their general anatomical structure.\n\nOne of the most remarkable of the species is the argo, or sea argus, which we shall here describe. The whole body of the argus is obliquely flat, or perpendicularly compressed; its thickness in the middle is six lines, whence growing gradually thinner, at the edge it is no more than half a line thick. It is three inches and five lines in length, and two inches broad. The back shines with a scarlet dye, and the belly is of an agreeable clay colour, and both are curiously marked with white and black spots. The whole substance of the body is coriaceous and solid, and if cut through the middle, appears everywhere tinged with a saffron colour. Round the circumference of the body it is pliant, whence, at the animal's pleasure, it is formed into various folds and plaiting. The head, which in all other animals is easily known by the peculiarity of its structure, in the argus is not determinable when its back is turned to the spectator, for the oval shape of the body, of nearly the same diameter throughout the circumference, makes no distinction of head. The tentacula too, which appear toward each extremity, are so much alike in this situation, as not to serve for distinguishing the head; but if the animal be turned, it will appear that the head is situated in that part from which the tapered tentacula rise. One half of these tentacula is white, and sunk into small round cavities, formed to the depth of two lines in the substance of the head. Their apex is prominent from the cavity, and is everywhere marked with black dots, which are supposed to be so many eyes, and afforded the reason for denominating this animal argus.\n\nIf the tentacula are touched, they are immediately withdrawn entirely within their cavities. On the upper part of the head is a mamillary prominence, situated near the belly, at about half an inch from the edge, and in the middle is seen a small oval aperture, which is the mouth of the argus.\n\nOne of the most remarkable parts of the animal, and that which distinguishes it from all others, remains to be described.\n\nOn that part of the back which is opposite to the head, four lines distant from the border, is an oval aperture eight lines in length, and five broad. From the middle of this hole arises a fleshy trunk of a whitish colour, four lines long, one and a half broad, which divides into two larger branches, the right hand one subdivided into eight, the left into six lesser branches, which at length end in small slender twigs. Besides these, another large branch arising from the middle of the first trunk, runs off towards the head. On every one of the branches and twigs there are many black spots discernible by the naked eye, which contribute not a little to the beauty of this blooming part; but whether those punctures were hollow, has not been ascertained, even with the assistance of the microscope; though they are probably so many open mouths of vessels and breathing points. While the argus remains in the sea-water, it keeps this wonderful assemblage of lungs expanded; when out of the water, and touched with the finger, it contracts it into the form of a crown; and if the handling and irritation be continued for any time, it conceals the lungs entirely within the oval aperture, which is also then contracted into a narrower compass. Being put again into salt water, the aperture soon enlarges, and the branches of the lungs concealed within gradually push out again, lengthen, and expand.\n\n33. Tethis.\n\nBody detached, rather oblong, fleshy, and without peduncles; mouth with a terminal cylindrical proboscis, under an expanded membrane or lip; apertures two, on the left side of the neck.\n\nThere are only two species; viz. leporina, and fimbrida, the latter of which is a very elegant looking animal, about six inches long, with a white body, having a fringed border, variegated with black and clay colour, and in some places glittering with gold coloured spots. It is found in the Adriatic.\n\n34. Holothuria.\n\nBody detached, cylindrical, thick, and open at the extremity; mouth surrounded by fleshy branched tentacula.\n\nThere are 23 species of this genus, viz. elegans, frondosa, phantapus, tremula, phyllalis, thalia, caudata, denudata, * pentactis, papillofa, spallanzani, priapus, squamata, penicillus, fulus, inherens, laevis, minuta, forcipata, zonaria, vittata, maxima, and impatiens.\n\nOf these we shall describe the holothuria tremula, which has the following specific character.\n\nUpper surface covered with numerous conical papillae; lower with cylindrical ones; tentacula fasciculate. (Vid. fig. 11.)—This species commonly measures eight inches in length when dead; but alive it extends itself to more than a foot, or contracts its body into a ball. Its figure is cylindrical, the diameter of which is every way equal to an inch and a few lines. The back of a dark brown, proudly bears a variety of fleshy pyramid-like nipples, of a dark colour likewise at their basis, but white at their apex. They are observed to be of two\ntwo different sizes; the larger occupy the length of the back, in number 14 on each side, at the distance of six lines from each other, when the holothuria is contracted; but the intervening space is fully eight lines when the animal is extended. Others, like these, are placed here and there promiscuously. The lips are scattered in like manner, without order, in every part of the back. Out of them all exude a whitish mucilage, serving to lubricate the body. Hence all these nipples seem to be so many glands furnished with an excretory duct, the aperture of which is so minute as not to be discoverable by the help of a common glass. That they are, moreover, provided with various muscles, follows from hence, that the holothuria can raise and obliterate them at pleasure. While the larger papillae are quite erect, their axis, and the diameter of their base, measures three lines. The belly, or part opposite to the back, in the holothuria, is of a pale brown, and set all over with cylindrical tentacula, in such numbers, that the head of a pin could scarcely find room between them. Their diameter is not much above a line, and their length is that of four lines. They are of a thinning whitening, except the extremity, which is of a dusky dark colour, and shaped like a socket. By the help of these tentacula, the holothuria fixes its body at the bottom of the sea, so as not to be easily removed by tempests, which would otherwise happen very frequently, as this animal dwells near the flores, where the water scarcely rises to the height of a fathom. Now, if it adheres to other bodies by means of its ventral tentacula, their point must necessarily have the form of a socket, as the cuttle-fish, sea-urchins, and star-fish have theirs shaped, by which they lay hold of any other body.\n\nFrom this situation of the holothuria at the bottom of the sea, which it also retains when kept in a vessel filled with sea water, it must be evident to any one, that we have not groundlessly determined which was its back, and which its belly, which otherwise in a cylindrical body would have been a difficult task. But as all animals uniformly walk or rest upon their bellies, and the holothuria likewise has likewise that part of its body turned to the earth on which the cylindrical tentacula are to be seen, it is clear that part is the abdomen or belly of this animal. However, both the abdominal and dorsal tentacula are raised and obliterated at the animal's pleasure, from which it is reasonable to conclude, that they are furnished with elevating and depressing muscles, and particularly because all the foreaid tentacula disappear after the animal's death; and hence it farther appears, that many naturalists have given a representation of a dead holothuria, since they have assigned it no tentacula.*\n\n35. TEREVELLA.\n\nBody oblong, creeping, naked, often inclosed in a tube, furnished with lateral faucicles or tufts and branchiae; mouth placed before, furnished with lips, without teeth, and protruding a clavate proboscis; feelers numerous, ciliate, capillary, feated round the mouth.\n\nThere are 11 species, viz. cirrata, lapidaria, * conchilega, complanata, carunculata, rostrata, flavia, rubra, aphroditois, biconis, and stellata.\n\nOf these the terebella lapidaria, or stone-piercer; cal-\n\nled by the French Pinceau de Mer; the sea pencil, is species thus described by Barbut. \"From the midst of the Mollusca, hairs issues the head of this small animal, supported by a long neck, and putting forth two small branching horns. The mouth, which is round, is armed with small teeth, like those of the echini marini, with which it masticates its food. The hairs are very fine, soft as silk, and form a tuft, from the middle of which issues the neck, and then its head. The body is shaped like that of a worm, is very long, and terminates at one end in a point, which very much resembles the stick end of a painting brush. The small head of our terebella appears underneath, drawn back as in the snail. It walks or crawls by the help of five small feet, placed on each side of the large part of its body, at the rising of the tuft of hairs, and close to each other.\"\n\n36. TRITON.\n\nBody oblong; mouth with an involute spiral proboscis, having 12 tentacula, 6 on each side, divided nearly to the base, the hind ones being cheliferous.\n\nThere is only one species, viz. littoreus, found on the shores of Italy.\n\n37. SEPIA.\n\nBody fleshy, receiving the breast in a sheath, having a tubular aperture at its base; arms 8, befit with numerous warts or suckers; and besides, in most species, 2 pedunculated tentacula; head short; eyes large; mouth resembling a parrot's beak. Cuttlefish.\n\nCuvier divides the genus sepia into two, which he calls seiche, comprehending most of the species enumerated by Linnaeus under lepia, and poulpe, comprising two species. The former have a face, with a kind of fin on each side, and they contain towards the back a peculiar body of a friable or cartilaginous substance, transparent in the living animal, which is placed within the flesh, without adhering to it; and proceeding from one side to the other without any articulation. The head is round, and provided with two large moveable eyes, the organ of vision of which is almost as perfect as that of the eyes of warm-blooded animals. The mouth is situated at the top of the head, and has two similar jaws, in form and substance resembling the beak of a parrot, and surrounded with eight conical tentacula, furnished with suckers, by means of which the animal fixes itself to the rocks or other substances, so firmly, that it is often easier to tear away one of these arms than to induce the animal to quit its hold. The two others are very long, and have no suckers except at their extremity. These last seem to serve the animal for anchors to hold by.\n\nJust before the neck there is a sort of funnel, which closes up the entrance of a face, and seems to be the anus. These animals have internally a liver, a muscular gizzard, a coecum, and a short intestinal canal. The circulation in these animals is carried on by very singular organs; there is a heart placed at the bottom of the face, by which the blood is distributed to every part of the body, by means of arteries, and to which it is returned by veins, through a large vena cava, which divides itself for the purpose of conveying the blood to\ntwo other hearts, one on each side, which distribute it to the gills, from whence it is passed to the first heart.\n\nThe female produces eggs that are assembled together in the form of a bunch of grapes.\n\nThese animals, when they perceive the approach of danger, emit a quantity of inky fluid, furnished by a particular vessel, and by thus obscuring the water, render their escape more easy, while from the bitterness of this liquid their foe is induced to give over the pursuit. There seems little doubt that the opinion of Swammerdam, that this liquor furnishes the Indian or China ink, is just; for if this ink be dissolved in water, in any considerable quantity, it very soon acquires a very high degree of putridity, which seems to prove that it is formed of some animal substance; and none seems better calculated for the purpose than this black liquor.\n\nThe second genus of Cuvier differs from the sepia, properly so called, in wanting the solid bony substance in the back, and the two long arms; but the eight tentacles are much longer in the individuals of this genus than in those of the sepia.\n\nThe male cuttle-fish always accompanies the female; and when he is attacked, he braves every danger, and will attempt her rescue at the hazard of his own life; but as soon as the female observes her partner to be wounded, she immediately makes off. When dragged out of the water, these animals are said to utter a sound like the grunting of a hog.\n\nThe hard substance, or bone as it is called, in the back of the cuttle-fish, when dried and powdered, is employed to form moulds, in which silversmiths cast their small articles, such as spoons, rings, &c.; and it also forms that useful article of stationary called pounce.\n\nIn the Systema Naturae there are described eight species of sepia, viz. * octopus, * officinalis, unguiculata, hexapus, * media, * loligo, * sepia, and tunicata.\n\nOf these, the officinalis was in great esteem among the ancients as an article of food, and is still used as such by the Italians.\n\nThe sepia octopus, or eight-armed cuttle-fish, which inhabits the seas of warm climates, is a most formidable animal, being sometimes of such a size as to measure 12 feet across its centre, and to have each of its arms between 40 and 50 feet long. It is said that he will sometimes throw these arms over a boat or canoe, which he would infallibly drag to the bottom, with those who are in it, did not the Indians, who are aware of this danger, carry with them a hatchet to cut off the arms.\n\n38. CLIO.\n\nBody naked, free, and floating, furnished with a fin on each side; head distinct, and having gills at the surface of the fins.\n\nThe above character of clio is that of Cuvier, who has written an able account of this and two other genera of his new order of mollusca, which he calls pteropoda, or mollusca pinnae, in the 4th vol. of Ann. de Mus. Nat.\n\nGmelin enumerates six species of clio, viz. caudata, pyramidata, retusa, borealis, helicina, and limacina.\n\n39. ONCHIDIUM.\n\nBody oblong, creeping, flat beneath; mouth placed before; feelers two, situated above the mouth; arms two, at the sides of the head; vent behind, and placed beneath.\n\nThere are two species, viz. typhoe, which is described by Dr. Buchanan in the 5th vol. of the Linnaean Transactions; and peronii, described by Cuvier in a late number of the Ann. de Mus. Nat.\n\n40. LOBARIA.\n\nBody lobate, convex above, flat below.\n\nThere is only one species, viz. quadriloba, characterized as having a tail with four lobes. It is found in the north seas.\n\n41. LERNÆA.\n\nBody oblong, somewhat cylindrical, naked; tentacula or arms, two or three on each side and round, by which it affixes itself; ovaries two, projecting like tails from the lower extremity.\n\nThere are 15 species, viz. branchialis, * cyprinacea, * salmoncea, * afellina, * huchonis, clavata, uncata, gobina, radiata, nodosa, cornuta, pectoralis, lota, cyclopterina, and pinnarum.\n\n42. APHRODITA.\n\nBody creeping, oblong, covered with scales, and furnished with numerous brittle fasciculate feet, on each side; mouth terminal, cylindrical, retractile; feelers two, fetaceous, annulate; eyes four.\n\nThere are 9 species, viz. * aculeata, * scabra, * squamata, imbricata, plana, * lepidota; cirrofa, violacea, and longa.\n\nOf these we shall describe the first, the aculeate aphrodite, by some called the sea mouse. It is of an oval form, grows to the length of between four and five inches; the belly is covered with a naked skin and somewhat prominent in the middle; its substance is somewhat firm. It is clothed with hairy filaments, which are short on the middle of the back, but longer at the sides; they are all somewhat rigid and firm; those on the back stand erect, like the quills of a porcupine; those on the sides lie flat, and are of a great variety of colours; a beautiful blue and lively green are very distinct in them, but a golden yellow seems the most predominant colour: on the back they are of a darker colour, and in many places of a grayish brown. It dwells in the European ocean, and lives upon shell-fish. It has 32 fasciculated projectors, resembling feet, on each side.\n\n43. AMPHITRITE.\n\nBody projecting from a tube and annulate; peduncles or feet small, numerous; feelers two, approximate, feathered; eyes none.\n\nThere are seven species, viz. reniformis, penicillus, ventilabrum,\nSpecies. ventilabrum, auricoma, cristata, chrysocephala, and Mollusca.\n\n44. Spiro.\n\nBody projecting from a tube, jointed, and furnished with dorsal fibres; peduncles rough, with bristles, and placed towards the back; feelers two, long, simple; eyes two, oblong.\n\nThere are two species, viz. feticornis and filicornis.\n\n63 Nereis.\n\n46. NEREIS.\n\nBody long, creeping, with numerous lateral peduncles on each side; feelers simple, rarely none; eyes two or four, rarely none.\n\nThe species are 29 in number, and are divided into three sections.\n\nA. Mouth furnished with a claw;\n\nContaining vericolor, * nodiluca, fimbriata, armillaris, mollis, * delagica, tubicola, norwegica, pinnata, corniculata, pufilla, incifa, and aphroditoidea.\n\nB. Mouth furnished with a proboscis;\n\nContaining * cerulea, * viridis, maculata, crassa, stellifera, punctata, alba, flavo, longa, priscimica, bifrons, ceca, ebranchiata, lamelligera, and ciliata.\n\nC. Mouth furnished with a tube;\n\nContaining one species, viz. prolifera.\n\nOne of the most remarkable of these species is the nodiluca, of which we shall here give a short account.\n\nBody blue green, with 23 segments, so small as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye.—This is one of those phosphorescent animals that illuminate the ocean in the dark. Their numbers and wonderful agility, added to their shining quality, do not a little contribute to these illuminations of the sea; for myriads of these animalcula are contained in a small cup of sea water. Innumerable quantities of them lodge in the cavities of the scales of fishes; and to them, probably, the fishes owe their noctilucent quality. \"I have observed with great attention (says Barbus) a fish just caught out of the sea, whose body was almost covered with them; and have examined them in the dark: they twist and curl themselves with amazing agility, but soon retire out of our contracted sight; probably their glittering dazzling the eye, and their extreme minuteness eluding our researches. It is to be observed, that when the unctuous moisture which covers the scales of fishes is exhausted by the air, these animals are not to be seen, nor are the fishes then noctilucent, that matter being perhaps their nourishment when living, as they themselves afford food to many marine animals. They do not shine in the day-time, because the solar rays are too powerful for their light, however aggregate, or immense their number.\"\n\n47. Naïs.\n\nBody creeping, long, linear, depressed, and pellucid; peduncles, with small bristles on each side; no tentacula; eyes two or none.\n\nThere are 10 species, viz. vermicularis, * serpentina, * proboficidae, elinguis, * digitata, barbata, ceca, litoralis, marina, and quadriculipidata.\n\n48. Physophora.\n\nBody gelatinous, pendent from an aerial vehicle, with gelatinous feilie members at the sides; numerous tentacula beneath.\n\nThere are three species, viz. hydrostacta, rosea, and filiformis.\n\n49. Medusa.\n\nBody gelatinous, orbicular, and generally flat underneath; mouth central, beneath.\n\nThese animals have been denominated sea nettles, from the opinion that the larger species, when touched, excite a tingling sensation, and slight redness of the skin. They are supposed to form the chief food of the cetaceous fish; and many of them shine with great brilliancy in the water. The form of their body, while at rest, is that of the segment of a sphere, of which the convex surface is smooth, and the flat part provided with several tentacula. The body is transparent, and so gelatinous, that it is reduced almost to nothing, by evaporation, when left dry upon the shore. Several coloured lines may be seen within; but there is nothing which gives marks of a circulation going on. The lines, indeed, towards the borders are more numerous, but they seem to be appendages of the alimentary cavity. These animals swim very well, and appear to perform that motion by rendering their body alternately more or less convex; and thus striking the water. When left upon the shore, they lie motionless, and look like large flat cakes of jelly.\n\nThe species are distributed into two sections.\n\nA. Body with ciliated ribs.\n\nThis contains four species, viz. infundibulum, pileus, cucumis, and ovum.\n\nB. Body smooth.\n\nThis contains 40 species, viz. porpita, * cruciata, hylocella, * aquorea, * aurita, capillata, * pilaevis, marufupialis, hemispherica, pelagica, nodiluca, * fusca, * purpura, * tuberculata, * undulata, * lunulata, nuda, velelia, spirans, pulmo, tyrrhena, tubercularis, utricularis, caravella, umbella, dimorpha, campanula, digitata, frondosa, tetrastyla, octotyla, andromeda, corona, persea, cephea, proboficidalis, mollicina, pileata, crucigera, and unguiculata.\n\n50. Lucernaria.\n\nBody gelatinous, wrinkled, branched; mouth placed beneath.\n\nThere are three species, viz. quadricornis, phrygia, and auricula.\n\n51. Asterias.\n\nBody depressed, covered with a coriaceous crust; muriate, with tentacula, and grooved below; mouth central, and five-rayed.\nThese animals, which are usually called *flor-fish*, or *sea-larts*, constitute one of the most numerous genera of the mollusca. They are very curious in their forms, but are almost all radiated, as stars are usually painted; and some of them, from the minuteness of their rays, make a very beautiful appearance.\n\nBy the coriaceous crust, with which they are covered, they are defended from the attacks of the smaller animals, that inhabit the seas in which they reside. Each of the rays has a great number of short, soft, and fleshy tubes, that serve for tentacula, and seem not only designed for taking prey, and aiding the motion of the animal; but also for enabling it to cling to the rocks, and thus resist the force of the waters. These tentacula have been found to exceed 1500 in a single animal; they are situated on the lower surface, and when the animal is laid on its back, they may be seen to be pushed out and withdrawn like the horns of snails. The rays enable them to swim, but they move very slowly. These rays are very brittle, and are easily broken off; but when this happens, their power of reproduction is so great, that they are speedily renewed. The mouth is armed with bony teeth, for breaking the shells of the small fish on which they feed; and from the mouth a canal proceeds through each of the rays, becoming narrower as it approaches the tip.\n\nFor preserving these animals, Mr Barbut advises that they be drowned in brandy or other spirits, taking care to keep the rays all the time extended. Then it is easy to draw out the entrails by the mouth with a pair of forceps; and after this is done, the animal may be dried.\n\nThere are 45 species distinguished, according to their circumference is more or less divided.\n\nA. Lunate,\n\nComprehending four species, viz. nobilis, pulvillus, militaris, and luna.\n\nB. Stellate,\n\nComprising 20 species, viz. papoosa, spongiosa, rubens, sepolita, endeca, minuta, glacialis, clathrata, echinitis, recticulata, phrygiana, nodosa, violacea, sanguinolenta, perforata, araneica, equetris, leavigata, membranacea, granularis.\n\nC. Radiate,\n\nComprising 20 species, viz. rosea, pertusa, ophiura, aculeata, ciliaris, sphærolata, pentaphylla, varia, aculearis, haftata, filia, nigra, tenella, pettinata, multiradiata, caput medusa, euryali, aligates, nigrita, tricolor, and fragilis.\n\nMany of these are extremely beautiful; but one of the most showy is the caput medusa, or arborecent flor-fish.\n\nHaving five rays, each subdivided, dichotomous; rays and disk granulate; mouth depressed (Vid. fig. 12.). —This extremely singular species is occasionally met with in most seas; but it is not very common. It has five equidistant, thick, jointed rays, proceeding from the centre; and each of them is divided into two other smaller, and each of these is again subdivided in a similar manner; and this subdivision is carried, in the most beautiful and regular gradation, to a vast extent, so that the extreme ramifications sometimes amount to several thousands. Mr Bingley speaks of a specimen that was three feet across, and had 512 extremities to each ray, making in all 2560. By this curious structure, the animal becomes, as it were, a living net, and is capable of entangling such creatures as are designed for its prey, by the sudden contraction of these numerous ramifications, by the intricacy of which they are prevented from escaping.\n\nThe colour of the living animal is a reddish or deep carnation; but when dead it is more of a gray colour. To preserve this curious animal whole and undamaged for cabinets, it should be taken far out at sea, and the fishermen should be careful not to break off any of the limbs, and to keep it as still as possible. It should be dried in the shade in some open place, as in the sun it is apt to melt away, and if too much in the shade, to become putrid.\n\nThis species is so valuable, that the fishermen at the Cape get from six to ten rix-dollars for a specimen.\n\n51. Echinus.\n\nBody roundish, covered with a bony crust, and generally furnished with moveable spines; mouth placed beneath, and commonly five-valved.\n\nThe animals of this genus are called *sea urchins* or *sea hedgehogs*, from the spines which grow on their external covering; they are also called *sea eggs*, probably from many of them being eatable. They are all inhabitants of the seas; and are so nearly alike in character, that a description of one species will serve to illustrate the whole family.\n\nThere are no less than 109 species, which are subdivided as follows.\n\nA. Vent vertical, and all the tentacula simple.\n\na. Globular or hemispherical,\n\nContaining 37 species, viz. *eculentus, sphæra, droebachienis, miliaris, basteri, haemisphericus, angulosus, excavatus, globulus, sphæroides, gratilla, lixula, faxatilis, fenestratus, subangularis, ovarius, diadema, calamaris, araneiformis, stellatus, radiatus, circinatus, cidaris, mamillatus, lucunis, atratus, coronatus, alterzans, afflatus, fardicus, lamneus, variegatus, pufualtus, granulatus, tessellatus, botryoides, and torcumaticus.\n\nb. Shaped somewhat like a shield;\n\nFour species, viz. *sinuatus, semiglobosus, quinquibiatus, and conoideus.\n\nB. Having the vent beneath and no tentacula at the mouth.\n\na.

Base exactly circular;\n\nOne species, viz. subuculus.\n\nc. Base oval;\n\nThree species, viz. cycloformus, semilunaris, and seniformis.\n\nY y 2\n\nd. Base\nd. Base oval and acute; vent opposite the mouth;\n\nSix species, viz. * scutatus, ovatus, * pustulosus, quadriradiatus, minor, and dubius.\n\ne.

Ovate; margin entire;\nTwo species, viz. oviformis and orbiculatus.\n\nf. Flat on both sides, with petal-shaped avenues; mouth central, flat, and toothed; crown with four pores.\n\n1. Having a finuated margin and perforated surface;\nSeven species, viz. biforis, pentaporus, hexaporus, emarginatus, auritus, inauritus, and tetraporus.\n\n2. Having a finuated margin and entire surface;\nFive species, viz. * laganum, subrotundus, reticulatus, orbicularis, and gorallatus.\n\n3. Having a toothed margin;\nThree species, viz. decadastylus, octadastylus, orbiculus.\n\ng. With ten avenues on the crown; rays straight, biporous, and flellate; mouth and vent near each other in the middle of the base;\n\n13 species, viz. nucleus, centralis, ervum, craniolaris, turcicus, vicia, ovulum, lathyrus, equinus, minus, falca, inaequalis, raninus, and butonius.\n\nC. Vent lateral, with pencilled tentacula at the mouth.\n\na. Circular; mouth central, vent square;\nOne species, viz. placenta.\n\nb. Heart-shaped, with the crown grooved;\nTwo species, viz. cor anguinum and lacunosus.\n\nc. Heart-shaped, with the crown not grooved;\nEight species, viz. radiatus, purpureus, pusillus, complanatus, * subglobulus, ananchitis, bicordatus, and carinatus.\n\nc. Ovate, with grooved avenues;\nOne species, viz. spatagus.\n\nd. Ovate, with the avenues not grooved;\nEight species, viz. brissoides, teres, oliva, amygdala, ovalis, pyriformis, lapifcaneri, and patellaris.\n\nMany of the above have hitherto been found only in a fossile state.\n\nSubglobular, with 10 avenues of pores; and the intermediate spines covered with small tubercles, supporting the spines. fig. 13.—This animal, which lodges in cavities of rocks, just within low water mark, on most of the British coasts, is nearly of a globular shape, having its shell marked into ten partitions or divisions, not much unlike those of an orange. The mouth is situated in the lower part, and armed with five strong and sharpened teeth. The stomach and intestines which are of considerable length, are disposed in a somewhat circular form; and the whole body is supported entirely by a set of upright bones or columns.\n\nOn the right side of the shell is a prodigious number of sharp moveable spines, of a dull white and greenish colour, curiously articulated, like ball and socket, with tubercles on the surface, and connected by strong filaments to the skin or epidermis, with which the shell is covered. The spines are the instruments by which the animal conveys itself at pleasure from one place to another; and by means of these it is enabled to move at the bottom of the water with great swiftness. It generally employs those about the mouth for this purpose, keeping that opening downwards; but it is also affected to have the power of moving forwards, by turning on itself like a wheel. When anything alarms these animals, they immediately move all their spines towards it, and wait an attack, as an army of pikemen would with their weapons. The number of muscles, fibres, and other apparatus necessary to the proper management of these must be very great, and are exceedingly wonderful. So tenacious are the sea-urchins of the vital principle, that on opening one of them, it is no uncommon circumstance to observe the several parts of the broken shell, move off in different directions.\n\nBetween the spines, and disposed in a continued longitudinal series on the several divisions or regions of the shell, are an infinite number of very small knobs, communicating with an equal number of tentacula placed above them. These are the instruments by which the creature fixes itself to any object, and stops its motion. They are possessed of a very high degree of contractile power, and are furnished at the extremities with an expanible part, which may be supposed to operate as a sphincter, or as the tail of a leech, in fastening the animal securely to rocks and other substances to which they choose to adhere.\n\nThe shell of this animal, when deprived of the spines, which easily fall off in dying, is of a pale reddish tinge, and the tubercles on which the spines are fixed, appear like so many pearly protuberances on the surface.\n\nAt Marteilles, and in some other towns on the continent, this species is exposed for sale in the markets, as oysters are with us, and is eaten boiled like an egg. It forms an article of food among the lower classes on the sea coasts of many parts of this country, but does not seem to have made its way to the tables of the great.\n\nThis order of Mollusca contains 32 genera, and about 433 species.\n\nOrder IV. ZOO PHYTA.\n\nThe creatures ranked under this order seem to hold a middle rank between animals and vegetables. Most of them are, like the latter, fixed by a root to a certain spot, from which they never move, and where they sprout and grow; many of them propagate, like plants, by buds, or flips; and some of them appear only to be entitled to rank as animal bodies by their possessing a degree of irritability a little superior to the sensitive plant. Few of them enjoy the faculty of locomotion, though the agility with which they seize their prey and the instinct which directs them in search of it, shew them to be really animal bodies.\nThe coral reefs that surround many islands, particularly those in the Indian Archipelago, and round New Holland, are formed by various tribes of these animals, especially by those of the five first genera.\n\nM. Peron observed, that the animals form these corals with such rapidity, that enormous masses of them very speedily appear, where there was scarcely any mark of such reefs before.\n\nThe principal works that treat of the Zoophyta are those of Ellis, Solander, Pallas, and Dr Shaw's \"Naturalist's Miscellany\".\n\n53. Tubipora.\n\nAnimal probably a nervous; coral, consisting of erect, hollow, cylindrical, parallel, aggregate tubes.\n\nThere are 10 species, viz. mucifera, catenulata, * ferruginea, falciculata, ramofa, pennata, penicillata, flabellaria, stellata, and frutes.\n\n54. Madrepora.\n\nAnimal resembling a medusa; coral with lamellate star-shaped cavities.\n\nThere are 118 species, which are distributed into five subdivisions, viz.\n\nA. Composed of a single star,\n\nContaining six species, viz. * verrucaria, turbinata, * porpita, fungitis, patella, and cyathus.\n\nB. With numerous separate stars, and continued numerous gills.\n\n14 species, viz. pileus, cristata, lactuca, ficoides, acrofa, lichen, agaricites, elephantatus, crullacea, incrufans, exefa, filograna, natans, and anthophyllum.\n\nC. With numerous united stars.\n\nThere are 15 species, viz. labyrinthisca, sinuosa, meandrites, areola, abdita, phrygia, repanda, ambigua, daedalia, gyrofa, clivofa, cerebrum, involuta, implicata, and cochlea.\n\nD.

Gorgonia.\n\nAnimal growing in the form of a plant; leathery, corky, woody, horny, or bony; composed of glairy or stony fibres; streaked, tapering, dilated at the base, covered with a cellular flesh or bark, and becoming spongy and friable when dry; mouths covering the surface of the flesh and polype-bearing.\n\nThere are 41 species, viz. lepadifera, verticillaris, * placomus, mollis, succinia, americana, exferta, patula, ceratophyta, juncea, flammea, umbraculum, purpurea, faflappo, palma, radicata, suberofa, coralloides, elongata, scirpea, fetacea, viminalis, muricata, * verrucosa, antipathes, * anceps, nobilis, crassa, pinnata, fanguinolenta, violacea, fetofa, petechizans, peclinata, abietina, calyculata, briareus, ventalina, reticulum, clathrus, and * flabellum.\n\n60. Alcyonium.\n\nAnimal generally growing in the form of a plant; stem fixed, fleety, gelatinous, spongy or leathery, and beset with stellate cells bearing polypes.\nThere are 28 species, viz. arboreum, exos, * digitatum, schlofferi, lyncurium, * burfa, cydonium, * ficus, gelatinosum, manus diaboli, * arenolum, botryoides, mafa, cranium, rubrum, mammillofum, ocellatum, tuberosum, gorgonoides, abeflum, albumen, papilliferum, * conglomeratum, * afacidoides, synovium, vermiculare, stellatum, and corniculatum.\n\n61. Spongia.\n\nAnimal fixed, flexible, torpid, of various forms, composed either of reticulate fibres, or masses of small spines interwoven together, and clothed with a gelatinous flesh, full of small mouths on its surface by which it absorbs and rejects water.\n\nThere are 49 species, viz. ventilabrum, flabelliformis, infundibuliformis, fittularis, aculeata, tubulofa, * cornata, ciliata, cancellata, rubra, nigra, officinalis, * oculata, muricata, nodosa, * tentoformia, bacillaris, dichotoma, * stipula, * crista, * palmata, prolifer, * potrycides, * panicea, fulva, tubularia, fibrillofa, taficulata, baifa, lichenoides, papillaris, cavernosa, finuola, frondosa, agaricina, tupa, membranofa, compressa, penicillum, coaliata, plana, cruciata, oliformis, mauda, ficiformis, * lacustris, fluviatilis, friabilis, and canalicum.\n\nThe sponges consist of a ramified mass of capillary tubes, that were long supposed to be the production of a species of worms, which are often found within their cavities; an idea, however, which is now nearly exploded. Others have imagined them to be only vegetables; but that they are possessed of animality, appears evident from the circumstance of their pores alternately contracting and dilating, and from their even shrinking in some degree from the touch, when examined in their native situations. Their structure probably enables them to absorb nourishment from the surrounding fluid.\n\nThese animals are certainly the most torpid of all the zoophytes. The individuals differ very much from each other, both in form and structure. Some of them, as the common sponge, are of no determinate figure; but others are cup-shaped, tubular, &c.\n\nIrregularly formed, porous, rough, lobed, and woolly.—The officinal sponge is elastic, and very full of holes; it grows into irregular lobes of a woolly consistence, and generally adheres, by a very broad base, to the rocks. It is chiefly found about the islands in the Mediterranean, where it forms a considerable article of commerce. A variety of small marine animals pierce and gnaw into its irregular winding cavities. These appear on the outside, by large holes raised higher than the rest. When it is cut perpendicularly, the interior parts are seen to consist of small tubes, which divide into branches as they appear on the surface. These tubes, which are composed of reticulated fibres, extend themselves every way, by this means increasing the surface of the sponge, and ending at the outside in an infinite number of small circular holes, which are the proper mouths of the animal. Each of these holes is surrounded by a few erect pointed fibres, that appear as if woven in the form of little spines. These tubes, with their ramifications, in the living state of the sponge, are clothed with a gelatinous substance, properly called the flesh of the animal. When the sponge is first taken it has a strong fishy smell, and the fishermen take great care in making it perfectly clean, in order to prevent its growing putrid.\n\n62. Flustra, Sea Mat-Weed, or Horn-Wrack.\n\nAnimal a polype, proceeding from porous cells; stem fixed, foliaceous, membranaceous, composed of numerous rows of cells, united together, and woven like a mat.\n\nThere are about 18 species, viz. * foliacea, * truncata, * pilosa, * chartacea, * carbacea, bombycina, verticillata, * dentata, * bullata, tomentosa, denticulata, tubulofa, hispida, frondiculofa, papyracea, hirta, * membranacea, and lineata.\n\n63. Tubularia.\n\nStem tubular, simple or branched, fixed by the base; animal proceeding from the end of the tube, and having its head crested with tentacula.\n\nThere are 26 species, viz. magnifica, cornucopiae, * indivisa, * ramosa, ramea, * filulofa, fragilis, * multifidae, papyracea, penicillus, acetabulum, splachnea, * coryna, * affinis, fabricia, longicornis, multicornis, repens, * campanulata, * reptans, fultana, stellaris, simplex, * pallanzani, membranacea, * and flabelliformis.\n\nOf these, by far the largest, and probably the most beautiful species, is the magnifica, which is thus characterized by Dr Shaw.\n\nWith a simple whitish tube, and very numerous tentacula, variegated with red and white. (Vide fig. 14.)\n\nIt is found in various parts of the coast of Jamaica, adhering to the rocks. It is very shy, and on being approached, instantly recedes within its elastic tube, which on a farther alarm also retires into the rock, and specimens can be procured only by breaking off such parts of the stone as contained them. These being put into tubs of sea-water, may be kept for months in perfect preservation.\n\n64. Corallina.\n\nAnimal growing in the form of a plant; stem fixed, with calcareous subdivided branches, mostly jointed.\n\nThere are 38 species, viz. tridens, opuntia, monile, infracta, tuna, nodulofa, * squamata, loricata, palmata, * elongata, subulata, granifera, * officinalis, pennata, * rubens, * crista, * spermophoros, * corniculata, fragillima, fruticulofa, indurata, lichenoides, rugosa, marginata, cylindrica, oblongata, obtusa, lapideiceps, barbata, rofarium, culpidae, tribulus, flabellum, conglutinata, phoenix, peniculum, penicillum, and teretris.\n\n65. Sertularia.\n\nAnimal growing in the form of a plant, stem branched, producing polypes from cup-shaped denticles or minute cells.\n\nThere are 77 species, which are distributed into two sections.\n\nA. Stem horny, tubular, fixed by the base, beset with cup-shaped denticles, and furnished with vesicles or ovaries containing polypes, eggs, or the living young.\n\n* Rosacea, * pumila, * operculata, * tamarica, * abietina,\nSpecies etina, nigra, fusifascens, obsoleta, pinus, cupressoides, Zoophyta, cupreolina, argentea, rugosa, helecina, theja, myriophyllum, hypoides, speciosa, fulcata, pluma, echinata, antennina, verticillata, gelatinola, volubilis, syringa, culcata, putulofa, frutefascens, pinnataer, pennatula, filicina, quadridentata, spicata, evanflis, muricata, fecundaria, milieniflora, racemosa, uva, lindigera, geniculata, dichotoma, spinola, pinnata, fetacea, polygonias, pennaria, lichenatum, cedrina, imbricata, purpurea, articulata, filicina, and fruticae.\n\nB.

Pennatula, the Sea-pen.\n\nAnimal not fixed, of various shapes; supported by a bony part within; naked at the base; the upper part having generally lateral ramifications furnished with rows of tubular denticles, with radiate polypes from each tube.\n\nThere are 18 species, viz. coccinea, grifea, phlophorea, pilosa, rubra, mirabilis, fagitta, antennina, flellfera, phaloides, arundinacea, scipio, juncea, grandis, argentea, encrinus, cynomorium, and reniformis.\n\n67. Hydra, the Polype.\n\nAnimal fixing itself by the base; linear, gelatinous, naked, contractile, and furnished with fæceous tentacles; inhabiting fresh waters, and producing its deciduous offspring from its sides. (Vid. fig. 15.)\n\nThese animals are among the most curious productions of nature, chiefly as exhibiting the most surprising example of diffused vitality. Though not so formidable as the hydra destroyed by Hercules, they are rendered equally prolific by being cut in pieces.\n\nThere are about five species, viz. viridis, fusca, grifea, gelatinosa, and pallens.\n\nThe three first species are those on which the greatest number of experiments have been made; and their shapes are so various, that it is by no means easy to describe them. They are generally found in ditches. Whoever has carefully examined these when the sun is very powerful, will find many little transparent lumps of the appearance of jelly, and size of a pea, and flatted upon one side. The same kind of substances are likewise to be met with on the under side of the leaves of plants that grow in such places. These are the polypes in a quiescent state, and apparently inanimate. They are generally fixed by one end to some solid substance, with a large opening, which is the mouth, at the other, having several arms fixed round it, projecting as rays from the centre. They are slender, pellucid, and capable of contracting themselves into very small compass, or of extending to a considerable length. The arms are capable of the same contraction and expansion as the body, and with these they lay hold of minute worms and insects, bringing them to the mouth, and swallowing them. The indigestible parts are again thrown out by the mouth.\n\nThe green polype was that first discovered by M. Trem-viridis, bley; and the first appearances of spontaneous motion were perceived in its arms, which it can contract, expand, and twist about in various directions. On the first appearance of danger they contract to such a degree, that they appear little longer than a grain of land, of a fine green colour, the arms disappearing entirely. Soon afterwards, he found the grifea, and afterwards the fusca. The bodies of the viridis and grifea diminish almost insensibly from the anterior to the posterior extremity; but the fusca is for the most part of an equal size for two thirds of its length from the anterior to the posterior extremities, from which it becomes abruptly smaller, and then continues of a regular size to the end. These three kinds have at least six, and at most twelve or thirteen arms. They can contract themselves till their bodies do not exceed one fourth of an inch in length, and they can stop at any intermediate degree of expansion or contraction. They are of various sizes, from an inch to an inch and a half long. Their arms are seldom longer than their bodies, though some have them an inch, and some even eight inches long. The thickness of their bodies decreases as they extend themselves, and vice versa; and they may be made to contract themselves either by agitating the water in which they are contained, or by touching the animals themselves. When taken out of the water they all contract too much, that they appear only like a little lump of jelly. They can contract or expand one arm, or any number of arms, independent of the rest; and they can likewise bend their bodies or arms in all possible directions. They can also dilate or contract their bodies in various places, and sometimes appear thick set with folds, which, when carelessly viewed, appear like rings. Their progressive motion is performed by that power, which they have of contracting and dilating their bodies. When about to move, they bend down their heads and arms, lay hold by means of them on some other substance to which they design to fasten themselves; then they loosen their tail, and draw it towards the head; then either fix it in that place, or stretching forward their head as before, repeat the same operation. They ascend or descend at pleasure in this manner upon aquatic plants, or upon the sides of the vessel in which they are kept; they sometimes hang by the tail from the surface of the water, or sometimes by one of the arms; and they can walk with ease upon the surface of the water. On examining the tail with a microscope, a small part of it will be found to be dry above the surface of the water; and, as it were in a little concave space, of which the tail forms the bottom; so that it seems to be suspended on the surface of the water on the same principle that a small pin or needle is made to swim. When a polype, therefore, means to pass from the sides of the glass to the surface of the water, it has only to put that part out of the water by which it is to be supported, and to give it time to dry, which it always does upon these occasions; and they attach themselves so firmly by the tail to aquatic plants, stones, &c. that they cannot be easily disengaged: they often further strengthen these attachments.\nThe stomach of the polype is a kind of bag or gut into which the mouth opens, and goes from the head to the tail. This, in a strong light, is visible to the naked eye, especially if the animal be placed between the eye and a candle; for these animals are quite transparent whatever their colour may be: the stomach, however, appears to more advantage through a powerful magnifier. M. Trembley, by cutting one of these animals transversely into three parts, satisfied himself that they were perforated throughout. Each piece immediately contracted itself, and the perforation was very visible through a microscope. The skin which encloses the stomach is that of the polype itself; so that the whole animal, properly speaking, consists only of one skin, in the form of a tube, and open at both ends. No vessels of any kind are to be distinguished.\n\nThe mouth is situated at the anterior end in the middle between the shooting forth of the arms, and assumes different appearances according to circumstances; being sometimes lengthened out in the form of a nipple, at others appearing truncated; sometimes the aperture is quite closed, at others there is a hollow; though at all times a small aperture may be discovered by a powerful magnifier.\n\nThe skin of a polype, when examined with a microscope, appears like flagegreen, or as if covered with little grains, more or less separated from each other, according to the degree of contraction of the body. If the lips of a polype be cut transversely, and placed so that the cut part of the skin may be directly before the microscope, the skin throughout its whole thickness will be found to consist of an infinite number of grains, and the interior part is found to be more flaggreened than the exterior one; but they are not strongly united to each other, and may be separated without much trouble. They even separate of themselves, though in no great numbers, in the most healthy animals of this kind; for where they are observed to separate in large quantities, it is a symptom of a very dangerous disorder. In the progress of this disorder, the surface of the polype becomes gradually more and more rough and unequal, and no longer well defined or terminated as before. The grains fall off on all sides, the body and arms contract and dilate, and assume a white shining colour; and at last the whole dissolves into a heap of grains, which is more particularly observed in the green polype. By a careful examination we find, that the skin of the polype is entirely composed of grains, cemented by means of a kind of gummy substance; but it is to the grains entirely that the polype owes its colour. The structure of the arms is analogous to that of the body; and they appear flaggreened, when examined by the microscope, whether they be in a state of contraction or expansion; but, if very much contracted, they appear more flaggreened than the body, though almost quite smooth when in their utmost state of extension. In the green polype the appearance of the arms is continually varying; and these variations are more sensible towards the extremity of the arm than at its origin, but more scattered in the parts further on. The extremity is often terminated by a knob, the hairs of which cannot be observed without a powerful magnifier. They have a remarkable inclination for Zoophita, turning towards the light, so that if that part of the glass, on which they are, be turned from the light, they will quickly remove to the other.\n\nThat species named the fijca has the longest arms, fijca, and makes use of the most curious manoeuvres to seize its prey. They are best viewed in a glass seven or eight inches deep, when their arms commonly hang down to the bottom. When this or any other kind is hungry, it spreads its arms in a kind of circle to a considerable extent, including in this, as in a net, every insect which has the misfortune to come within the circumference. While the animal is contracted by seizing its prey, the arms are observed to swell like the muscles of the human body when in action. Though no appearance of eyes can be observed in the polype, they certainly have some knowledge of the approach of their prey, and shew the greatest attention to it as soon as it comes near them. It seizes a worm the moment it is touched by one of the arms; and in conveying it to the mouth, it frequently twists the arm into a spiral like a cork-crew, by which means the insect is brought to the mouth in a much shorter time than otherwise it would be; and so soon are the insects on which the polypes feed killed by them, that M. Fontana thinks they must contain the most powerful kind of poison; for the lips scarce touch the animal when it expires, though there cannot be any wound perceived on it when dead. The worm, when swallowed, appears sometimes fliggle, sometimes double, according to circumstances. When full, the polype contracts itself, hangs down as in a kind of stupor, but extends again in proportion as the food is digested, and the excrementitious part is discharged. The bodies of the insects, when swallowed, are first macerated in the stomach, then reduced into fragments, and driven backwards and forwards from one end of the stomach to the other, and even into the arms, which, as well as the other parts of this remarkable creature, are a kind of hollow guts or stomachs. In order to observe this motion, it is best to feed the polypes with such food as will give a lively colour; such, for instance, as those worms which are furnished with a red juice. Some bits of a small black snail being given to a polype, the substance of the skin was soon dissolved into a pulp consisting of small black fragments; and on examining the polype with a microscope, it was found that the particles were driven about in the stomach, and that they passed into the arms, from thence back into the stomach; then to the tail, from whence they passed again into the arms, and so on. The grains of which the body of the polype consists, take their colour from the food with which it is nourished, and become red or black as the food happens to afford the one or the other. They are likewise more or less tinged with these colours in proportion to the strength of the nutritive juices; and it is observable that they lose their colour if fed with aliment of a colour different from themselves. They feed on most insects, and fish or flesh, if cut into small bits. Sometimes two polypes lay hold of the same worm, and each begins to swallow its own end till their mouths meet and the worm breaks. But should this happen not to be the case, the one polype will sometimes devour the other along with its portion.\nIt appears, however, that the stomach of one polype is not fitted for diluting the substance of another; for the one which is swallowed always gets clear again after being imprisoned an hour or two.\n\nThe manner in which the polypes generate is most perceptible in the grifia and fusca, as being considerably larger than the viridis. If we examine one of them in summer, when the animals are most active, and prepared for propagation, some small tubercles will be found proceeding from its sides, which constantly increase in bulk, until at last in two or three days they assume the figure of small polypes. When they first begin to shoot, the excrescence becomes pointed, assuming a conical figure, and deeper colour than the rest of the body. In a short time it becomes truncated, and then cylindrical, after which the arms begin to shoot from the anterior end. The tail adheres to the body of the parent animal, but gradually grows smaller, until at last it adheres only by a point, and is then ready to be separated. When this is the case, both the mother and young ones fix themselves to the sides of the glass, and are separated from each other by a sudden jerk. The time requisite for the formation of the young ones is very different, according to the warmth of the weather and the nature of the food eaten by the mother. Sometimes they are fully formed, and ready to drop off in 24 hours; in other cases, when the weather is cold, 15 days have been requisite for bringing them to perfection.\n\nIt is remarkable, that there is a reciprocal communication of food between the young and old, before they be separated. The young ones, as soon as they are furnished with arms, catch prey for themselves, and communicate the digested food to the old ones, who on the other hand do the same to the young ones. This was fully verified by the following experiment. One of the large polypes of the fusca kind being placed on a slip of paper in a little water, the middle of the body of a young one growing out from it was cut open; when the superior part of that end which remained fixed to the parent was found to be open also. But cutting over the parent polype on each side of the throat, a short cylinder was obtained, open at both ends; which being viewed through a microscope, the light was observed to come through the young one into the stomach of the old one. On cutting open the portion of the cylindrical portion lengthwise, not only the hole of communication was observed, but one might see through the end of the young one also. On changing the situation of the two pieces, the light was seen through the hole of communication. This may be seen between the parent polype and its young ones after feeding them; for after the parents have eaten, the bodies of the young ones swell as if they themselves had been eating.\n\nThe polypes produce young ones indiscriminately from all parts of their bodies, and five or six young ones have frequently been produced at once; nay, M. Trembley has observed nine or ten produced at the same time.\n\nNothing like copulation among these creatures was ever observed by M. Trembley, though for two years he had thousands of them under his inspection. To be more certain on this subject, he took two young ones the moment they came from their parent, and placed them in separate glasses. Both of them multiplied, not only themselves, but also their offspring, which were separated and watched in the same manner to the seventh generation. They have even the same power of generation while adhering to their parent. In this state the parent, with its children and grandchildren, exhibits a singular appearance, looking like a thrub thick let with branches. Thus several generations sometimes are attached to one another, and all of them to one parent. Mr Adams gives a figure of one polype with 19 young ones hanging at it; the whole group being about one inch broad, and one inch and a half in length; the old polype ate about 12 monoculars per day, and the young ones about 20 among them.\n\nWhen a polype is cut transversely or longitudinally into two or three parts, each part in a short time becomes a perfect animal; and so great is this prolific power, that a new animal will be produced even from a small portion of the skin of the old one. If the young ones be mutilated while they grow upon the parent, the parts so cut off will be reproduced; and the same property belongs to the parent. A truncated portion will send forth young ones before it has acquired a new head and tail of its own, and sometimes the head of the young one supplies the place of that which should have grown out of the old one. If we slit a polype longitudinally through the head to the middle of the body, we shall have one formed with two heads; and by again slitting these in the same manner, we may form one with as many heads as we please.\n\nA still more surprising property of these animals is, that they may be grafted together. If the truncated portions of a polype be placed end to end, and gently pulled together, they will unite into a single one. The two portions are first joined together by a slender neck, which gradually fills up and disappears; the food passing from one part into the other; and thus we may form polypes, not only from different portions of the same animal, but from those of different animals. We may fix the head of one to the body of another, and the compound animal will grow, eat and multiply, as if it had never been divided. By pushing the body of one into the mouth of another, so far that their heads may be brought into contact, and kept in that situation for some time, they will at last unite into one animal, only having double the usual number of arms. The hydra fusca may be turned inside out like a glove, at the same time that it continues to eat and live as before. The lining of the stomach now forms the outer skin, and the former epidermis constitutes the lining of the stomach. If previous to this operation the polype have young ones attached to it, such as are newly beginning to vegetate turn themselves inside out, while the larger ones continue to increase in size till they reach beyond the mouth of the parent, and are then separated in the usual manner from the body. When thus turned, the polype combines itself in many different ways. The fore part frequently closes and becomes a supernumerary tail. The animal, which was at first straight, now bends itself, so that the two tails resemble the legs of a pair of compasses, which it can open and shut. The old mouth is placed as it were at the joint of the compasses, but loses its power of action; to supply which,\nSpecies. Infusoria.\n\nA new one is formed in its neighbourhood, and in a little time there is a new species of hydra found with several mouths.\n\nThe sides of a polype which has been cut through in a longitudinal direction, begin to roll themselves up, usually from one of the extremities, with the outside of the skin inwards; but in a little time they unroll themselves, and the two cut edges join together, sometimes beginning at one extremity, and sometimes approaching throughout their whole length. As soon as the edges join, they unite so closely that no fear can be perceived. If a polype be partly turned back, the open part closes, and new mouths are formed in different places. Every portion of a polype is capable of devouring insects, almost as soon as it is cut off, and the voracity of the whole tribe is astonishing; for Mr Adams observes, that most of the insects on which they feed bear the same proportion to the mouth of a polype, that an apple the size of a man's head bears to the mouth of a man.\n\nThe hydra pallens is very rarely met with, and is described by Mr Roffelle. It is of a pale yellow colour, growing gradually smaller from the bottom; the tail is round or knobbed; the arms are about the length of the body, of a white colour, generally seven in number, and are apparently composed of a chain of globules. The young are brought forth from all parts of its body.\n\nThe order Zoophyta contains 15 genera and 489 species.\n\nOrder V. Infusoria.\n\nWe have already, under the article Animalcule, treated of the general character and habits of the animals composing this order, and we can add little here to what has been said in that article. We shall therefore merely give the classification of the genera and species, and briefly notice a few of the more remarkable individuals.\n\nFew writers have written expressly on this order; but the principal are Muller, Brugiere, in the Encyclopedie Methodique, and Baker and Adams on the Microscope.\n\n68. Brachionus.\n\nBody contractile, covered with a shell, and furnished with rotatory cilia.\n\nThere are about 12 species, viz. urceolaris, patella, cirratus, tripus, uncinatus, mucronatus, cerminus, calyciflorus, tubifex, quadridentatus, patina, and striatus.\n\nThe patina is extremely bright and splendid, has a large body, a crystalline and nearly circular shell, without either incision or teeth, only towards the apex it falls in so as to form a smooth notch. A double glittering organ, with ciliated edges, projects from the apex; both of them of a conical figure, and standing as it were upon a pellucid substance, which is divided into two lobes, between which and the rotatory organ there is a silver-coloured crenulated membrane. Two small claws may likewise be discovered near the mouth.\n\nThe striatus has an oblong, pellucid shell, capable of altering its figure. The apex is truncated, with five small teeth on the edge of it, 12 longitudinal streaks down the back, the base obtuse and smooth. The teeth are occasionally protruded or retracted; and there are two small spines or horns on the other side of the shell. The animal itself is of a yellow colour, crystalline, and muscular; now and then putting out from the apex two or three little bundles of playing hairs, the two lateral ones shorter than that in the middle; on the outer side we may observe a forked deglutatory muscle, and two rigid points when the apex is drawn in. It is found in sea water.\n\n69. Vorticella.\n\nBody contractile, naked, and furnished with ciliate, rotatory organs.\n\nThere are about 57 species, which are arranged under three sections.\n\nA. Seated on a pedicle or stem.\n\n29 species, viz. * racemosa, * polyypina, * anastatica, conglomerata, * pyraria, * opercularia, * tuberosa, bianca, bellis, * umbellaria, * berberina, digitalis, fasciculata, annularis, nutans, gemella, * nebulosa, * convallaria, * lunaris, * globularia, inclinata, ringens, * pyriformis, fellata, vaginata, * citrina, cyathina, putrida, and patellina.\n\nB. Furnished with a tail.\n\n14 species, viz. * flocculosa, * socialis, * stentorea, * hyacinthina, auriculata, * furcata, fenta, * catulus, felis, vermicularis, * macroura, * rotatoria, * lacinalata, and fasciculata.\n\nC. Without tail or stem.\n\n14 species, viz. * ampulla, * crateraria, caniculata, * nafuta, * crateriformis, * truncatella, * limacina, * difficilis, cornuta, * cincta, * polymorpha, * viridis, * bursata, and * nigra.\n\nThe polyypina, when viewed through a small magnifier, appear like so many little trees; the upper part, or heads, are egg-shaped, the top truncated, the lower part filled with intestines; the branches thick set with little knobs. Vide fig. 16.\n\nThe fasciculata has a rotatory organ, which may sometimes be seen projecting beyond the aperture; there ia a little head at the apex, and the pedicle is twisted and very slender. A congealed green mass which is often found swimming about in ditches is composed of myriads of these animals, which are not visible to the naked eye, and when magnified appear like a bundle of green flowers.\n\nThe socialis, when considerably magnified, appears like a circle surrounded with crowns or ciliated heads, tied by small thin tails to a common centre, from whence they advance towards the circumference, where they turn very briskly, occasioning a kind of whirlpool, which brings its food. When one of them has been in motion for some time, it stops, and another begins; sometimes two or three may be perceived in motion at once; they are frequently to be met with separate, with the tail sticking in the mud. The body contracts and dilates very much, so as sometimes to have the appearance of a cudgel, at others to assume almost a globular form.\nThe floculosa appears to the naked eye like a yellow globule adhering to the ceratophyllon like a little flower or a heap of yellow eggs. When magnified, they are seen to consist of a congeries of animalcula constituting a sphere from a mouldy centre. They contract and extend their bodies either alone or in society, and excite a vortex in the water by means of a disk. When they quit the society and act singly, they may be observed to consist of a head, abdomen and tail; the head being frequently drawn back into the abdomen so far that it cannot be seen, only exhibiting a broad kidney-shaped disk standing out. The abdomen is oblong, oval, and transparent; the tail sharp, twice as long as the abdomen, sometimes rough and annulated, or altogether smooth.\n\n70. Trichoda.\nAnimal invisible to the naked eye, pellucid, hairy, or horned.\n\nThere are about 60 species, which are divided into three sections.\n\nA. Hairy.\n\n47 species, viz. grandinella, *cometa, *granata, *fol, *bamba, orbis, urnula, urinarium, *trigona, tinea, *pubes, *proteus, *gibba, *patens, *uvula, fulcata, *anas, *farcimen, *linter, *vermicularis, *melita, *fimbriata, camelus, *ratus, inquinilus, *innata, transfuga, ciliata, *cyclidium, *pulex, *lynceus, *charon, *cimex, pellionella, angulus, urufa, femulina, pupa, *pocillum, clavus, *muculus, *delphinus, clava, cuniculus, *pilcis, larus, and *longicauda.\n\nB. Furnished with cirri.\n\nFour species, viz. *aeacus, *ludis, fanaio, and volutator.\n\nC. Horned.\n\nNine species, viz. lyncaster, *histro, *cypris, *patalia, *pullaster, *mytilus, lepus, filurus, and calvium.\n\nThe grandinella is a very small pellucid globule, with the interstices scarcely visible; the top of the surface furnished with several small brittle not easily discoverable, as the creature has a power of extending or drawing them back in an instant. It is found in pure water as well as in infusions of vegetables.\n\nThe fol is small, globular, and crystalline; beset everywhere with diverging rays longer than the diameter of the body; the inside full of molecules. The body contracts and dilates, but the creature remains confined to the same spot. It was found with other animalcules in water which had been kept three weeks.\n\nThe proteus is that which Mr Baker distinguishes by the same name, and of which an account is given under the article Animalcule. It is found in the filmy matter adhering to the sides of the vessel in which vegetables have been infused, or animal substances preserved. That described by Mr Adams was discovered in the lime produced from the water where small fishes, water snails, &c. had been kept. The body resembled that of a snail, the shape being somewhat elliptical, but pointed at one end, while from the other proceeded a long, slender, and finely proportioned neck, of a size suitable to the rest of the animal.\n\n71. Cercaria.\nAnimal invisible to the naked eye, pellucid, and furnished with a tail.\n\nThere are 13 species; viz. *cyrinus, *inquieta, *lemna, *turbo, *podura, *mutabilis, catellus, *lupus, *vermicularis, pleuronectis, *tripus, cyclidium, and tenax.\n\nThe lemna varies its form so much, that it might be mistaken for the proteus of Baker, described under the article Animalcule; though in fact it is totally different. The body sometimes appears of an oblong, sometimes of a triangular, and sometimes of a kidney-shape. The tail is generally short, thick, and annulated; but sometimes long, flexible, cylindric, and without rings; vibrating, when stretched out, with so much velocity, that it appears double. A small pellucid globule, which Muller supposes to be its mouth, is observable at the apex; and two black points not easily discovered, he thinks, are its eyes. It walks slowly after taking three or four steps, and extends the tail, erecting it perpendicularly, shaking and bending it, in which state it very much resembles a leaf of the lemna.\n\n72. Leucophra.\nAnimal invisible to the naked eye, and everywhere ciliate.\n\nThere are eight species; viz. *conflictor, *vesiculifera, acuta, fluxa, armilla, *cornuta, *heteroclitia, and nodulata.\n\n73. Gonium.\nAnimal very simple, flat, angular, but invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThere are five species; viz. *pectorale, pulvinatum, polysphericum, truncatum, and rectangulum.\n\nThe pectorale is found in pure water, and moves alternately towards the right and left. It is quadrangular and pellucid, with 16 spherical molecules, of a greenish colour, set in a quadrangular membrane, like the jewels in the breast-plate of the high priest, reflecting light on both sides.\n\n74. Colpoda.\nAnimal invisible to the naked eye, very simple, pellucid, finuate.\n\nThere are seven species; viz. lamella, rostrum, cucullus, *meleagris, *cucullus, ren, *pyrum, and hypocrepis.\n\nThe cucullus is found in vegetable infusions, and in fecal hay, moving in all directions, and commonly with great velocity. It is very pellucid, and has a well-defined margin, filled with little bright vehicles differing in size, and of no certain number. Its figure is commonly oval, with the top bent into a kind of beak, sometimes oblong, but most commonly obtuse. It has in the inside from 8 to 24 bright little vehicles not discernible in such as are young. Some have supposed\nposed these to be animalcules which this creature has swallowed; but Mr Muller is of opinion that they are its offspring. When this creature is near death by reason of the evaporation of the water, it protrudes its offspring with violence. From some circumstances it would seem probable that this animalcule calls its skin, as is the case with some insects.\n\n75. Paramesium.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye, simple, pellucid, flattened, oblong.\n\nThere are seven species; viz. * aurelia, * chrysalis, * oviferum, * marginatum, caudatum, anceps, and acutum.\n\nThe aurelia is membranaceous, pellucid, and four times longer than it is broad; the fore part obtuse and transparent; the hind part filled with molecules. It has somewhat the appearance of a gnatlet, by reason of a fold which goes from the middle to the apex, and is of a triangular figure. It moves in a rectilinear and vacillatory manner. It is found in ditches where there is plenty of duckweed; and will live many months in the same water without any renewal of it.\n\n76. Cyclidium.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye, very simple, pellucid, flat, orbicular or oval.\n\nThere are seven species; viz. * bulla, milium, glaucoma, * radians, rostratum, * nucleus, and pediculus.\n\n77. Bursaria.\n\nWorm very simple, membranaceous, hollow.\n\nThere are three species; viz. truncatella, * hirundinella, and * duplella.\n\n78. Vibrio.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye; very simple, round, elongated.\n\nThere are 20 species; viz. lineola, bacillus, undula, vermiculus, intertinum, * lunula, malleus, * serpentinus, * aceti, * glutinis, * anguillula, utriculus, falcio, colymbus, cygnus, * anler, * odor, falx, diffusus, and * proteus.\n\nThe anler is found in water where duckweed grows. The trunk is elliptic, round, and without any inequality on the sides. It is full of molecules; the hind part sharp and bright; the fore part produced into a bending neck, longer than the body; the apex whole and even, with blue canals passing between the marginal edge, occupying the whole length of the neck; and in one of them a violent deflection of water to the beginning of the trunk is observable. It moves the body slow, but the neck more briskly.\n\n79. Enchelis.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye; very simple, cylindrical.\n\nThere are 15 species; viz. viridis, * punctifera, nodulosa, sarcimen, femulum, ovulum, pyrum, fulus, frutillis, * caudata, epitomium, * retrograda, * truncus, spatula, and papula.\n\n80. Bacillaria.\n\nBody consisting of cylindrical straw-like filaments, placed parallel to each other, and frequently changing their position.\n\nThere is only one species; viz. paradoxa.\n\n81. Volvox.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye; simple, pellucid, spherical.\n\nThere are nine species; viz. globulus, pilula, * spharula, uva, * lunula, dimidiatus, * globator, pileus, and bulla.\n\nThe globator, or spherical membranaceous volvox, is globator, found in great numbers in the infusions of hemp and tremella, and in flagrant waters in spring and summer. It was first observed and described by Leeuwenhoek; but the descriptions of it given by authors differ considerably from each other. The following is that of Mr Baker. \"There is no appearance of either head, tail, or fins. It moves in every direction, backwards, forwards, up or down, rolling over and over like a bowl, spinning horizontally like a top, or gliding along smoothly without turning itself at all: sometimes its motions are very slow, at other times very swift; and when it pleases it can turn round as upon an axis very nimbly, without moving out of its place. The body is transparent, except where the circular spots are placed, which are probably its young. The surface of the body in some is as if all dotted over with little points, and in others as if granulated like shagreen. In general it appears as if let round with short moveable hairs.\" Another author informs us, that \"they are first very small, but grow so large that they can be discerned with the naked eye; they are of a yellowish green colour, globular figure, and in substance membranaceous and transparent; and in the midst of this substance several small globes may be perceived. Each of these are smaller animalcules, which have also the diaphanous membrane, and contain within themselves still smaller generations, which may be distinguished by means of very powerful glasses. The larger globules may be seen to escape from the parent, and then increase in size.\"\n\nThis little animal appears like a transparent globule of a greenish colour, the fetus being composed of smaller greenish globules. In proportion to its age it becomes whiter and brighter, and moves slowly round its axis; but to the microscope its surface appears as if granulated; the roundest molecules fixed in the centre being largest in those that are young. The exterior molecules may be wiped off, leaving the membrane naked. When the young ones are of a proper size, the membrane opens, and they pass through the fissure, after which the mother melts away. Sometimes they change their spherical figure, and become flat in several places. They\nThey contain from 8 to 30 and 40 globules within the membrane.\n\n82. Monas.\n\nWorm invisible to the naked eye; most simple, pellucid, resembling a point.\n\nThere are five species; viz., *atomus, punctum, *micro, *lens, and ternio.\n\nThis order contains 15 genus and 229 species.\n\nHow many kinds of these invisibles there may be (says Mr Adams), is yet unknown; as they are distinguished from those which are barely invisible to the naked eye, to such as resist the force of the microscope as the fixed stars do that of the telescope, and with the greatest powers hitherto invented, appear only as so many moving points. The smallest living creatures our instruments can show, are those which inhabit the waters; and though animalcula equally minute may fly in the air, or creep upon the earth, it is scarce possible to get a view of them; but as water is transparent, by confining the creatures within it we can more easily observe them by applying a drop of it to the glases.\n\nAnimalculae in general are observed to move in all directions with equal ease and rapidity; sometimes obliquely, sometimes straight forward; sometimes moving in a circular direction, or rolling upon one another, removing backwards and forwards through the whole extent of the drop, as if diverting themselves; at other times greedily attacking the little parcels of matter they meet with. Notwithstanding their extreme minuteness, they know how to avoid obstacles, or to prevent any interference with one another in their motions: sometimes they will suddenly change the direction in which they move, and take an opposite one; and by inclining the glass on which the drop of water is, as it can be made to move in any direction, so the animalculae appear to move as easily against the stream as with it. When the water begins to evaporate, they flock towards the place where the fluid is, and show a great anxiety and uncommon agitation of the organs with which they draw in the water. These motions grow languid as the water fails, and at last cease altogether, without a possibility of renewal if they be left dry for a short time. They sustain a great degree of cold as well as insects, and will perish in much the same degree of heat that destroys insects. Some animalculae are produced in water at the freezing point, and some insects live in snow. By mixing the least drop of urine with the water in which they swim, they instantly fall into convulsions and die.\n\nThe same rule seems to hold good in these minute creatures, which is observable in the larger animals, viz. that the larger kinds are less numerous than such as are smaller; while the smallest of all are found in such multitudes, that there seem to be myriads for one of the others. They increase in size, like other animals, from their birth until they have attained their full growth; and when deprived of proper nourishment, they in like manner grow thin and perish.\"\n\nEXPLANATION OF FIGURES.\n\nFig. 1. *Acaris Lumbricoides*, entire, and nearly of its natural size; *a*, the head; *b*, the tail; *c*, the depressed band; *d*, the punctiform aperture; *e*, the line extending from the head to the tail; *f*, the gyrated apparatus as it appears through the skin of the worm.\n\nFig. 2.

He studied medicine at Louvain and some other places with so much avidity, that he had perused Hippocrates, Galen, and the Greek and Arabian physicians at a very early period of life. When not more than 17 years of age, he read public lectures at Louvain, and was created M.D. in the year 1599 when only 22. Having, in 1609, married a wife who was both rich and noble, he retired with her to Vilvorde, where he practised as a physician without taking any fees, and was accustomed to boast of the thousands whom he cured every year, although his success in his own family was by no means great; for his eldest daughter died of a leprosy, and he lost two sons by the plague. He published a variety of works, by which he acquired very great reputation. He was invited to the court of Vienna by the emperor Rodolph, which he declined to accept. He died in the year 1644, in the 68th year of his age.\n\nHe was a man of acute genius, clear-sighted in detecting the mistakes of others, and extremely fond of forming hypotheses of his own, which were not always supported by conclusive arguments. He affirmed with boldness, was extremely credulous, and fond of such extravagant narrations as seemed to favour his own preconceived opinions. Perhaps his greatest foible was the liberal manner in which he praised himself, in reference to his own nostrums and pretended specifics. His ideas were far from being perspicuous, chiefly owing to his making use of terms and phrases which he never properly defined. He added much, however, to the stock of chemical facts at that time known, and paved the way to more interesting discoveries. He contributed more than any of his predecessors, to subvert the Galenical theory of humours and qualities, which he certainly combated with many forcible arguments. His theory of ferments was in a great measure espoused by Sylvius. His son Francis-Mercurius first published his works collectively in 1648; and although it cannot be denied that they abound with error, and even jargon, they contain many pertinent remarks, and much curious and interesting speculation.\n\nHelmont, a small town in the Netherlands, in Dutch Brabant, and capital of the district of Peeland, with a good castle. It is seated on the river Aa, in E. Long. 5° 37'. N. Lat. 51° 31'.\n\nHELMSTADT, a town of Germany, in the duchy of Brunswick, built by Charlemagne, in E. Long. 11°. N.

She died abbess of Paraclet in 1163. See Abelard.\n\nHELOS, in Ancient Geography, a maritime town of Laconia, situated between Trinaus and Acrae, in Pausanias's time in ruins. The district was called Helotea, and the people Helotes, Helote, Helei, and Heleate, by Stephanus; and Iloite, by Livy. Being subdued by the Lacedemonians, they were all reduced to a state of public slavery, or made the slaves of the public, on these conditions, viz. that they neither could recover their liberty nor be sold out of the territory of Sparta.\nHence the term *Helots*, in Harpocration, for being in a state of slavery; and hence also the Lacedaemonians called the slaves of all nations whatever *helotes*. *Heloticus* is the epithet.\n\n**HELOTS**, in Grecian antiquity, the slaves of the Spartans. See Helos.—The freemen of Sparta were forbidden the exercise of any mean or mechanical employment, and therefore the whole care of supplying the city with necessaries devolved upon the Helots.\n\n**HELSINGBURG.** See Elsinburg.\n\n**HELSINGIA,** a province of Sweden, bounded on the north by Jemperland and Medelpadion, on the east by the Bothnic gulf, and on the south and west by Dalecarlia and Gefriccia. It is full of mountains and forests, and the inhabitants are almost constantly employed in hunting and fishing. It has no cities: the principal towns are, Hudwickvald, Alta, and D'libo.\n\n**HELSINGIC CHARACTER,** a peculiar kind of character found inscribed on stones in the province of Helsingia. The Runic and Helsingic characters may be easily transformed into each other.\n\n**HELSTON,** a town of Cornwall in England, situated on the river Cober, near its influx into the sea, one of the towns appointed for the coinage of tin, and the place of assembly for the west division of the county. It had formerly a priory and a castle, and sent members to parliament in the reign of Edward I., but was not incorporated till the time of Queen Elizabeth. It was re-incorporated in 1774. A little below the town there is a tolerable good harbour, where several of the tin-ships take in their lading. King John exempted this place from paying toll anywhere but in the city of London. It contains about 400 houses, and sends two members to parliament.\n\n**HELVELLA,** a genus of the natural order of fungi, belonging to the cryptogamia class of plants. See Botany Index.\n\n**HELVEVIC,** something that has a relation to the inhabitants of the Swiss cantons, who were anciently called Helveti.—The Helvetic body comprehends the republic of Switzerland, consisting of 13 cantons, which make so many particular commonwealths. By the laws and customs of the Helvetic body, all differences between the several states and republics are to be decided within themselves, without the intervention of any foreign power. The government of this body, before its subjugation to France, was chiefly democratic, with some mixture of the aristocratical.\n\n**HELVETII,** a people of Belgica, in the neighborhood of the Allobroges and the Provincia Romana; famed for bravery and a turn for war. Called *Civitas Helvetia*, and divided into four pagi or cantons; situated to the south and west of the Rhine, by which they were divided from the Germans; and extending towards Gaul, from which they were separated by Mount Jura on the west, and by the Rhodanus and Lacus Lemanus on the south, and therefore called a Gallic nation (Tacitus, Caesar, Strabo, Ptolemy, Pliny). Formerly a part of Celtic Gaul, but by Augustus assigned to Belgica.\n\n**HELVETIUS, Claude-Adrian,** a man of letters, and celebrated French philosopher, was born at Paris in the year 1715. After receiving the rudiments of his education in his father's house, he was sent to the college of Louis the Great, where he discovered greater indications of genius than any of his fellow students, Helvetius, and thus gained the esteem of the professor of rhetoric, by whom particular attention was paid to his education. By his elegant and graceful exterior he endeavored to ingratiate himself with the fair sex; but he was soon convinced, that although external accomplishments may dazzle for the moment, nothing short of intellectual accomplishments can secure the conquest. The circumstance which led him to perceive the absolute necessity of mental improvement in order to be truly esteemed and admired, is worthy of notice. When walking alone in one of the public gardens, he discovered a most extravagant figure amidst a circle of young and amiable ladies. This was M. Maupertuis, who engrossed all the care and attention of this charming group, notwithstanding the ridiculous and grotesque singularity of his dress. This convinced Helvetius that if he wished to be sincerely admired or esteemed, dancing, tennis, and all other bodily exercises must give place to the decoration of his mind. He therefore immediately became a solitary, silent student, and the mathematics in particular first attracted his notice; and in a short time he was deemed a fit companion for some of the first and most distinguished literary characters of the period in which he flourished. Voltaire and Montesquieu were among his early intimates; with the latter of whom he contracted a cordial and lasting friendship.\n\nThe first literary performance of M. Helvetius was of the poetical kind, consisting of epistles on happiness, but these were not communicated to the public till after his decease. When read in private however, they were very much admired, and Voltaire considered them as a strong proof of the didactic and philosophical powers of their author. When the *L'Esprit des Lois* of Montesquieu appeared in public, it was studied by Helvetius with the utmost care and attention, and his only fault to it was, that it did not contain the first ideas of the things of which it professed to treat. Instead of examining systems of legislation, and comparing them with each other, Helvetius was of opinion, that the nature of man should be first studied, and the laws for governing him founded on his own nature. This was true philosophy, and such ideas determined him to undertake a work which might supply what he conceived to be defects in the publication of Montesquieu. In the year 1758 this work made its appearance, under the title of *De l'Esprit*, &c., which was condemned by the parliament of Paris, because it was considered as degrading the nature of man; but this impolitic method of suppressing his labors made them sought for with avidity all over France, as well as other European countries, and gave them more importance than perhaps they would have otherwise acquired.\n\nTo avoid the malice of his enemies, he came over to England in the year 1762, and in the following year he went to Prussia, where he was received by the king with every mark of respect, who gave him lodgings in the palace, and admitted him into his familiar parties. He was uncommonly liberal to the indigent, some of whom but ill requited him, on which occasions he was wont to say to his friends, \"If I were a king, I would correct them; but as I am only rich, and they are poor, I did my duty in relieving them.\" Notwithstanding his constitution was excellent, from which his friends concluded that they would long enjoy the happiness of his\nHelvidians his society, he fell a victim to the gout in his head and Hemerobaptists in the month of December 1771, in the 56th year of his age.\n\nBesides his work De l'Esprit, he was the author of a \"Treatise on Man, his Intellectual Faculties and his Education,\" in 2 vols. 8vo. published after his death. In both it must be confessed that he has displayed very great ingenuity and taste, an extensive knowledge of human nature, and a turn for ridiculing the follies of mankind; but some of his hypotheses appear rather paradoxical, and perhaps his ironical observations on credulity and false religion can hardly be reconciled with a belief of genuine Christianity, which he openly professes.\n\nHELVIDIANS, a sect of ancient heretics, denominated from their leader Helvidius, a disciple of Auxentius the Arian, whose distinguishing principle was, that Mary, the mother of Jesus, did not continue a virgin, but had other children by Joseph.\n\nHELVOET-SLUIJS, a sea-port town of the United Netherlands, seated on the island of Voorn, in the province of Holland, and where the English packet-boat always goes. It is but a small place, consisting only of a handsome quay, and two or three little streets. But it is very well fortified, and esteemed the safest harbour in the country. The largest men of war may come up to the middle of the town; and yet it has but very little trade, because the merchants choose to live higher up the country. It surrendered to the French in 1795. E. Long, 4. 23. N. Lat. 51. 44.\n\nHEMATH, or HAMATH, in Ancient Geography, the name of a city (whose king was David's friend, 2 Sam. ix.) to the south of Lebanon, from which a territory was called Hemath, on the north of Canaan and south of Syria, as appears by the spies, Numb. xiii. 1 Kings viii. Ezek. xvii. Whether one or more cities and districts of this name lay in this tract, neither interpreters nor geographers are agreed. The eastern part was called Hemath-zoba, 2 Chron. viii. unless we suppose that there was a city in Zoba of this name, fortified by Solomon. In defining the boundary of Palestine, it is often said, from the entering of Hamath; as a province to be entered into through a strait or defile. And if there was such, the next question is, From what metropolis it was called Hemath & Antioch, capital of Syria, is supposed to be called Hemath or Amatha, (Jonathan, Targum, &c.); and again, Epiphania, (Josephus). Both were to the north of Lebanon; consequently not the Hemath of Scripture, the immediate boundary of Palestine to the north, and lying to the south of Lebanon.\n\nHEMATITES. See Hæmatites, Mineralogy Index.\n\nHEMEROBAPTISTS, a sect among the ancient Jews, thus called from their bathing and bathing every day, in all seasons; and performing this custom with the greatest solemnity, as a religious rite necessary to salvation.\n\nEpiphanius, who mentions this as the fourth hereby among the Jews, observes, that in other points these heretics had much the same opinions as the Scribes and Pharisees; only that they denied the resurrection of the dead, in common with the Sadducees, and retained a few other of the improprieties of these last.\n\nThe sect who pass in the East under the denomination of Sabians, calling themselves Mendai Ishihi, or the Hemerobaptists disciples of John, and whom the Europeans entitle the Christians of St. John, because they yet retain some knowledge of the gospel, is probably of Jewish origin, and seems to have been derived from the ancient Hemerobaptists; at least it is certain, that that John, whom they consider as the founder of their sect, bears no sort of similitude to John the Baptist, but rather resembles the person of that name whom the ancient writers represent as the chief of the Jewish Hemerobaptists. These ambiguous Christians dwell in Persia and Arabia, and principally at Baffora; and their religion consists in bodily washings, performed frequently, and with great solemnity, and attended with certain ceremonies, which the priests mingle with this superstitious service.\n\nHEMEROBIUS, a genus of insects belonging to the neuroptera order.

They went out of the city every morning, as soon as the gates were opened, and kept all day patrolling round the place; sometimes also making excursions farther into the country, to see that there were no enemies lying in wait to surprise them.\n\nHEMERODROMI were also a sort of couriers among the ancients, who only travelled one day, and then delivered their packets or dispatches to a fresh man, who ran his day, and so on to the end of the journey. The Greeks had couriers of this kind, which they derived from the Persians, who were the inventors thereof, as appears from Herodotus. Augustus had the same; at least he established couriers, who, if they did not receive each other from day to day, yet did it from space to space, and that space was not very great.\n\nHEMEROTROPIS, in antiquity, a measure of capacity, the same with the choenix.

See Key and Bridge.\nHEMICYCLIUM was also a part of the orchestra in the ancient theatre. Scaliger, however, observes, it was no standing part of the orchestra; being only used in dramatic pieces, where some person was supposed to be arrived from sea, as in Plautus's Rudens.\n\nThe ancients had also a sort of sundial, called hemicyclium. It was a concave semicircle, the upper end or cusp whereof looked to the north. There was a style, or gnomon, issuing from the middle of the hemicycle, whereof that point corresponding to the centre of the hemicycle represented the centre of the earth; and its shadow projected on the concavity of the hemicycle, which represented the space between one tropic and another, the sun's declination, the day of the month, hour of the day, &c.\n\nHEMIMERIS, a genus of plants belonging to the didynamia class.

See Oratory, No. 77.\n\nHEMP. See Cannabis, Botany Index.—It does not appear that the ancients were acquainted with the use of hemp, in respect of the thread it affords. Pliny, who speaks of the plant in his natural history, lib. xx. cap. 23, says not a word of this; contenting himself with extolling the virtues of its stem, leaves, and root. In effect, what some writers of the Roman antiquities remark, viz. that the hemp necessary for the use of war was all stored up in two cities of the western empire, viz. at Ravenna and Vienne, under the direction of two procurators, called procuratores linifici, must be understood of linum or flax.\n\nThe use of hemp is so extensive and important, that vast quantities of it are annually imported into this and other kingdoms from those countries where it grows in greatest plenty, of which Russia is one. In the year 1763, the quantity imported into England alone amounted to 11,000 tons. Sir John Sinclair informs us, Annals of Agriculture, vol. xiii., p. 508, that in the year 1783, the quantity exported from Peterburgh in British ships was as follows:\n\n| Poods |\n|-------|\n| Clean hemp | 1,038,791 |\n| Outshot | 37,382 |\n| Half-clean | 18,374 |\n| Hemp-codille | 19,251 |\n\nNow, allowing 63 poods to a ton, the quantity just mentioned will amount to 17,695 tons; and supposing it to take five acres to produce a ton of hemp, the whole quantity of ground requisite for this purpose would amount to 88,475 acres.\n\nBy other accounts, the annual export of hemp to Annals of England is valued at 400,000l.; but by a computation Agriculture of the whole imported into Britain and Ireland in 1788, it would seem that a considerably greater quantity must fall to the share of England. In that year the quantity amounted to no less than 58,464 tons; which at 20l. per ton amounted to 1,269,280l. We cannot wonder at this vast consumption, when it is considered that the sails and cordage of a first-rate man of war require 180,000 lb. of rough hemp for their construction; but even this will scarce account for the enormous consumption in France, which in the year 1783 is said to have amounted to upwards of 400 millions of pounds, or 200,000 tons; of which more than one-third was imported.\n\nOnly the coarser kinds of hemp are employed in making cordage, the better sorts being used for linen, which, though it can never be made so fine as that from flax, is yet incomparably stronger, and equally susceptible of bleaching both in the old and new way. Cloths made of hemp have also this property, that their colour improves by wearing, while that of linen decays. The prices of hemp linen are various; from 10d. to 4s. 6d. per yard. The low-priced kinds are very generally worn in Suffolk, where hemp is cultivated, by husbandmen, farmers, &c.; those from 1s. 6d. to 2s. by farmers and tradesmen; and those from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. are frequently preferred by gentlemen to flax-linen.\nHemp-linen, on account of their strength and warmth. The English hemp is much superior in strength to that which grows in any other country. Next to it is the Russian, from which sacking is usually made, as it is sometimes also from the offal of the English kind; but none of the Suffolk hemp is ever made into cordage, or account of its fineness. A considerable quantity of Russia sheeting is imported into England merely on account of its strength, and is much coarser at the price than any other foreign linen.\n\nBesides these uses of hemp, it is said to possess a property as a plant which renders it almost invaluable; viz. that of driving away almost all insects that feed upon other vegetables. Hence in some places of the continent they secure their crops from these mischievous attacks, by sowing a belt of hemp round their gardens, or any particular spot which they wish to preserve.\n\nThe important uses of hemp, and the superiority of that produced in Britain to other kinds, have rendered the culture of it an object of attention to government. Accordingly, in the year 1787, a bounty of threepence per stone was allowed on all the hemp raised in England; and probably with a view to encourage the growth of English hemp, duties have been laid on that which comes from abroad. Dressed hemp in a British ship pays 2l. 4s. per cwt. import duty; in a foreign one 2l. 6s. 9½d.; and in both cases a drawback of tl. 19s. is allowed. Undressed hemp in a British ship pays 3s. 8d.; and in a foreign one 3s. 11½d. In both cases the drawback is 3s. 4½d. The export of British hemp is free.\n\nThe usual height of the plant when growing is from five to six feet, but this varies very considerably according to circumstances. That which is cultivated near Bischwiller in Alsace is sometimes more than 12 feet high, and upwards of three inches in circumference, the stalks being so deeply rooted that a very strong man can scarce pull them up. Mr Arthur Young, in a tour through Catalonia in Spain, says, that where the country is well watered, the crops of hemp are extraordinary; and that the plants generally rise to the height of seven feet. In Italy hemp is generally cultivated, though the Bolognese only can pretend to any superiority in the management of it. It is there sown upon their best lands, which are rich strong loams; and on which they are at all possible pains to procure a fine friable surface. For manure they use dung, pieces of rotten cloth, feathers, and horns brought from Dalmatia. The plant, however, may be cultivated upon ground of every kind; the poorer land producing that which is finer in quality though in smaller quantity; whereas strong and rich land produces a great quantity, but coarser. It does not exhaust the land on which it grows like flax; whence it is probable, that if properly managed, and care taken in the cultivation, it might be found to supercede flax entirely. A Sussex manufacturer, who writes on this subject in the Annals of Agriculture, informs us, that it may be raised for many years successively on the same ground, provided it be well manured. An acre requires from nine to twelve pecks, according to the nature of the soil; the latter being the most usual, though a variation in the quality of the soil makes an alteration both in the quantity and quality of the hemp. An acre produces on an average 36 or 38 stones. The abbé Brulle, in a treatise upon the Cultivation and Management of Hemp, printed by order of the lords of the committee of council for trade and foreign plantations, informs us, that the season for sowing it extends from the 25th of March to the 15th of June. The seed ought always to be sown thin, not exceeding two bushels to an acre; and if you have the advantage of a drill plough, still less will answer. As there are two kinds of hemp, the male and female, of which the former only produces seed, some regard must be had to this circumstance. In Sussex the male and female are pulled together about 13 weeks after the sowing, but in the fens they are frequently separated. This last method is recommended by the abbé Brulle, who, for the more easy accomplishment of it, directs that little paths should be made lengthwise through the field at about seven feet distance from each other, to allow a passage for the person who pulls up the female hemp from among the other; the latter requiring to stand more than a month after for the purpose of ripening the seeds. The female hemp is known to be ripe by the fading of the flowers, the falling of the farina fecundans, and some of the stalks turning yellow. After the whole of this kind is pulled, it must be manufactured according to the directions to be afterwards given, and ought to be worked if possible while green; the hemp thus produced being much finer than that which is previously dried. The reason of this is, that the plant contains a great quantity of glutinous matter; which being once dried, agglutinates the fibres in such a manner that they can never be afterwards perfectly separated. The female hemp, however, is always in smaller quantity than the male; and therefore where the crop is large, it will be impossible to work the whole as fast as it is pulled or cut. It is known to be ripe by the stems becoming pale; but it must be remembered, that hemp of any kind will be much less injured by pulling the plants before they are ripe than by letting them stand too long.\n\nThe male hemp being stripped of its leaves, &c. as afterwards directed, will soon be dry for storing by the heat of the atmosphere, though sometimes it may be necessary to use artificial means; but where these are used, the utmost care must be taken, hemp, when dry, being exceedingly inflammable. The stored or dried hemp must be steeped and treated in every other respect as though it had been green; whence it is evident that this operation ought never to be used but in cases of necessity. It is likewise impossible to make hemp which has been dried previous to its being steeped to white as that which has been worked green.\n\nWith regard to the perfecting of hemp-feed for a Mill's Horse, subsequent season, it would seem proper to set apart a handy piece of ground for this purpose: for M. Amien, from vol. v. 40 plants raised in the common way, had only a pound and a half of feed, though the plants from which it was taken might be deemed fine; whereas, from a single plant which grew by itself, he had seven pounds and a half. Some are of opinion, that by putting the clutters which contain the hemp-feed to heat and sweat, the quality is improved; as many of those feeds which would otherwise wither and die may thus arrive at perfection. This, however, seems to be very problematical; as there are no experiments which show that feeds,\nHemp when separated from the vegetable producing them, have any power of meliorating themselves.\n\nAfter the hemp is pulled, it must be taken in large handfuls, cutting off the roots (though this is not absolutely necessary), the leaves, seeds, and lateral branches, being dried off with a wooden sword or ripple. It is then to be made up into bundles of twelve handfuls each, in order to be steeped, like flax, in water. This, or something similar, is absolutely necessary, in order to separate the bark; which is properly the hemp, from the seed or woody part. In Suffolk this operation is called water-retting; but sometimes a mere exposure to the air is substituted in its place, turning the hemp frequently during the time it is exposed. This is called dew-retting; but the former method is universally deemed preferable. Such hemp as is designed for seed is seldom water-retted, though in the opinion of the manufacturer already quoted, it would be better if it were so. Dew-retted hemp is generally stacked and covered during the winter; in January and February it is spread upon meadow land, and whitens with the frost and snow; though it is always much inferior to the other, and proper for coarser yarns only.\n\nThe length of time required for steeping hemp is various, and a complete knowledge of it can only be attained by practice. In Suffolk it is usual to continue the immersion four, five, or six days; standing water is preferred, and the same water will steep hemp three times during the season, but the first has always the best colour. The abbé Brulle prefers clear and running water, especially if overhung with trees. The bundles are to be laid croswise upon each other, taking particular notice of the manner in which they lie when put in, that they may be taken out without difficulty. His time of steeping is from six to eleven days; and here we must observe, that it is much better to let it remain too long in the water than too short a time. The slenderest hemp requires the most soaking. The operation is known to be finished by the reed separating easily from the bark.\n\nAfter the hemp is thoroughly steeped, the next operation is to separate the bark from the reed or woody part; and this may be done in two ways, viz. either pulling out the reed from every stalk with the hand, or drying and breaking it like flax. The abbé Brulle is very particular in his directions for this last operation, which he calls reeding, and which may be performed either in a trough under water or upon a table. The whole, however, may be reduced to the following, viz. pressing down the bundles either in the trough or on a table, by proper weights, to keep the hemp steady in the middle and top end. Then beginning at the upper part of the bundle, pull out the reeds one by one. As you proceed, the rind which remains will press closely upon the remaining unreeded hemp, and keep it more steady; so that you may take two, four, or even six stalks, at a time. The weight is then to be removed from the top, and all the pieces of reed which remain there having broken off in the former operation, are to be taken out. Lastly, the middle weight is to be taken off, and any small pieces which remain there taken out. If the reeding is performed on a table, the bundle must be weeded frequently, though lightly; a continual dropping of water would perhaps be the best method.\n\nAfter the hemp is reeded, it must next be freed from the mucilaginous matter with which it still abounds. This is done by pouring water through it, squeezing out the liquid after every affusion, but taking care not to let the threads twist or entangle each other, which they will be very apt to do. The abbé is of opinion, that soft soap should be dissolved in the last water, in the proportion of an ounce to three pounds of dry hemp; which though not absolutely necessary, contributes much to the softening and rendering the hemp easy and pleasant to dress.\n\nHemp is broken by machinery, after being steeped, in a manner similar to flax; but the instruments used for this purpose in Suffolk are all worked by the hand. That which breaks in the operation is called fibres, and is about half the value of the long hemp. The best water-retted hemp sells for about 8s. 6d. per stone; the other kind from one to two shillings lower.\n\nBeating of hemp is the next operation, which formerly was performed entirely by hand, but now in most places by a water-mill, which raises three heavy beaters that fall upon it alternately; the hemp being turned all the while by a boy in order to receive the strokes equally. The finer it is required to make the tow, the more beating is necessary. It is then dressed or combed by drawing it through heckles formed like the combs of wool-manufacturers, only fixed. Sometimes it is divided into two or three sorts of tow, and sometimes the whole is worked together into one sort; the prices varying from 6d. to 1s. per pound.\n\nThe hemp thus manufactured is sold to spinners, who reel their yarn as follows:\n\n| 2 yards make | 1 thread. |\n|--------------|----------|\n| 40 threads   | 1 lea.   |\n| 20 leas      | 1 skein. |\n| 3 skeins     | 1 clue of 4800 yards. |\n\nIt is next delivered to the bleachers, who return it bleached on receiving 20 or 21 clues for every 120 bleached. The prices of the hemp-yarn are as follow:\n\n- 1 clue from a pound: 7½d. or 6½d.\n- 1½ from do.: 8¼d. or 8d.\n- 2 from do.: 9½d. or 9d.\n- 2½ from do.: 10½d. or 10d.\n- 3 from do.: 12d.\n\nChinese Hemp, a species of cannabis, of which an account is given in the 72nd volume of the Philosophical Transactions, p. 46. In that paper Mr Fitzgerald, vice-president of the society for encouraging arts, mentions his having received the seeds from the late Mr Elliot; which being sown, according to his directions, produced plants 14 feet high, and nearly seven inches in circumference. These being pulled up in November, and steeped for a fortnight in water, were placed against a southern wall to dry. After this the hemp was found to separate easily from the woody part; and so great was the produce, that 32 plants yielded three pounds and a quarter. In consequence of this success, Mr Fitzgerald applied to the directors of the India Company to procure some of the seeds from China; which being complied with, the society were furnished, in 1785, with some more of the seeds, which were distributed.\nbut to several of the members; but, notwithstanding their endeavours, few of the plants appear to have ripened their seeds in this country. Two of the species of hemp, tried by the duke of Northumberland, rose to the height of 14 feet seven inches, and would have been much larger, had they not been hurt by a high wind: another kind arose only to that of three feet and a half, the stem about the size of a common wheat straw; but though it flowered well, did not produce any seed. These kinds were sown in a hotbed where the heat was very strong, on the 14th of April. They appeared above ground in four days, and were transplanted into pots on the 25th. They were then put under a hot-bed frame where the heat had been gone off, to harden them for the natural ground, in which they were planted on the 30th, by turning them whole out of the pots; letting them, three together, be planted at two feet distance every way; covering them at times for about ten days, until they were supposed to be rooted. Only a few seeds were preserved from plants which had been kept constantly in a floe.\n\nOther trials were attended with little better success; but, in 1786, the Rev. Dr Hinton of Northwold near Brandon, made a successful experiment with some seeds he received from the secretary of the society. They were sown on the 17th of May, and appeared on the 6th of June. The plants were few and sickly; and notwithstanding some fine showers, they continued to languish so much that the experiment was entirely abandoned, and buckwheat was harrowed into the ground for a fallow crop. In the beginning of October, however, the persons employed in cutting the buckwheat discovered some seed in the heads of a few straggling hemp plants which had been suffered to grow in the crop; which being carefully threshed, afforded three pints of seed tolerably bright and heavy. These seeds were sown on the 10th of May 1787. On the 19th they appeared above the ground numerous and healthy. The male hemp was drawn on the 13th of August, but the female not till the 9th of October; the spot on which the plants were sown measured only 322 square yards, and produced of marketable hemp not less than 95 stone 7 pounds 12 ounces; being upwards of one-third more than the best crops of English hemp are ever known to produce. Thus it appeared, that the seeds of the Chinese hemp had retained their superiority over those of the English; though how long they would continue to do so cannot be determined but by experience. For this experiment Dr Hinton received a silver medal from the society. Few of the seeds either of Chinese, or any other hemp, will vegetate if two years old at the time of sowing; and to this circumstance the doctor attributes the failure of other trials of Chinese hemp.\n\n**Hemp-Agrimony**, a species of eupatorium. See **Eu-** **FATORIUM**, **BOTANY Index**.\n\n**HEMPSTEAD**, a town of Hartfordshire in England, in a hilly country, upon a small river called the Gade, and 20 miles north-west of London. It was, in the time of the Saxons, called by the name of Henamsted, or Hean-Hemstead, i.e. High-Hemstead. In William the Conqueror's time, by the name of Hemelamsted. Henry VIII. incorporated this village by the name of a bailiff; and he empowered the inhabitants to have a common feal, and a pye-powder court during its market and fairs. It has been reckoned one of the greatest markets for wheat in this county, if not in England, 20,000l. a-week being often returned in it only for meal. Eleven pair of mills stand within four miles of the place, which produce a great trade.\n\n**HEMSKERCK, EOBERT**, called the Old, a celebrated Flemish painter of humorous conversations, of whom, though so universally known, we have no information as to the time in which he flourished, or the school in which he was taught. Though the taste of his compositions is but low, yet it ought to be considered that he took his subjects from nature; from persons in the meanest occupations, whose dress, actions, and manners, could not furnish the imagination with any ideas of elegance; and to express their passions and undisguised humours, seems to have been the utmost of his ambition. By frequenting fairs, merry-meetings, gaming-houses, and inns, he acquired a surprising power of connecting humorous circumstances. He designed and drew correctly, and his pictures have a strong effect from his accurate management of the chiaro obscuro. Some of his pictures have suffered from unskilful cleaners, and many things are sold as his which dishonour him; but his genuine works, well preserved, have a clearness and force equal to any of the Flemish artists.\n\n**HEN.** See **PHASIANUS**, **ORNITHOLOGY Index**. **Guinea-HEN.** See **NUMIDA**, **ORNITHOLOGY Index**. **Hen-Bane.** See **HYOSCYAMUS**, **BOTANY and MATERIA MEDICA Index**.\n\n**Hen-Harrier.** See **FALCO**, **ORNITHOLOGY Index**.\n\n**Hen-Mould Soil**, in **Agriculture**, a term used by the husbandmen in Northamptonshire, and other counties, to express a black, hollow, spongy, and mouldering earth, usually found at the bottoms of hills. It is an earth much fitter for grazing than for corn, because it will never settle close enough to the grain to keep it sufficiently steady while it is growing up, without which, the farmers observe, it either does not grow well; or, if it seems to thrive, as it will in some years, the growth is rank, and yields much straw, but little ear. It is too moist, and to that is principally to be attributed this rankness of the crop in some years; and the occasion of its retaining so much moisture is, that it usually has a bed of stiff clay, which will not let the water run off into the under strata.\n\nIn some places they also give this name to a black, rich, and dense earth, with streaks of a whitish mould in many parts. This sort of hen-mould is usually found very rich and fertile.\n\n**HENAUTT, CHARLES JOHN FRANCIS**, an ingenious French writer, was the son of John Remi Henault lord of Mouffy, and was born at Paris in 1685. He early discovered a sprightly benevolent disposition, and his penetration and aptness soon distinguished itself by the success of his studies. Claude de Lille, father of the celebrated geographer, gave him the same lessons in geography and history which he had before given to the duke of Orleans, afterwards regent; and which have been printed in seven volumes, under the title of \"Abridgement of Universal History.\" On quitting college, Henault entered the Oratory, where he soon attached himself to the study of eloquence; and, on the death of the abbé Rene, reformer of La Trappe, he undertook to pronounce his panegyric; which not meet-\nHenault, ing the approbation of Father Massillon, he quitted the Oratory after two years, and his father bought for him, of Marechal Villeroi, the \"lieutenance des chasses,\" and the government of Corbeil. At the martial's he formed connexions, and even intimate friendships, with many of the nobility, and passed the early part of his life in agreeable amusements, and in the liveliest company, without having his religious sentiments tainted. He associated with the wits till the dispute between Rousseau and de la Motte Fontaine gave him a disgust for these trifling societies. In 1727, he gained the prize of eloquence at the French academy; and another next year at the academy des Jeux Floraux. About this time M. Reaumur, who was his relation, came to Paris, and took lessons in geometry under the same master, Guinée. Henault introduced him to the abbe Bignon, and this was the first step of his illustrious course. In 1713 he brought a tragedy on the stage, under the disguised name of Fucelier. As he was known to the public only by some slighter pieces, \"Cornelia the Veil\" met with no better success. He therefore locked it up without printing. In his old age his passion for these subjects reviving, and Mr Horace Walpole being at Paris in 1768, and having formed a friendship with him as one of the most amiable men of his nation, obtained this piece, and had it printed at his own press. In 1751 M. Henault, under a borrowed name, brought out a second tragedy, intitled, \"Marius,\" which was well received and printed. He had been admitted councillor in parliament in 1706, with a dispensation on account of age; and in 1710 president of the first chamber of inquests. These important places, which he determined to fill in a becoming manner, engaged him in the most solid studies. The excellent work of M. Domat charmed him, and made him eager to go back to the fountain head. He spent several years in making himself master of the Roman law, the ordinances of the French kings, their customs, and public law. M. de Morville, procureur-general of the great council, being appointed ambassador to the Hague in 1718, engaged M. Henault to accompany him. His personal merit soon introduced him to the acquaintance of the most eminent personages at that time there. The grand pensionary, Heinrich, who, under the exterior of Lacedemonian simplicity, kept up all the haughtiness of that people, left with him all that hauteur which France itself had experienced from him in the negotiations of the treaty of Utrecht. The agitation which all France felt by Law's system, and the consequent fending of the parliament into exile, was a trial to the wife policy of the president Henault. His friendship for the first president, De Mefmes, led him to second all the views of that great magistrate: he took part in all the negotiations, and was animated purely by the public good, without any private advantage. On the death of the cardinal du Bois, in 1732, he succeeded in his place at the French academy. Cardinal Fleury recommended him to succeed himself as director, and he pronounced the eulogy of M. de Malezieux.\n\nHistory was M. Henault's favourite study: not a bare collection of dates, but a knowledge of the laws and manners of nations; to obtain which he drew instruction from private conversations, a method he so strongly recommends in his preface. After having thus discussed the most important points of our public law, he undertook to collect and publish the result of his inquiries, and he is deservedly accounted the first framer of chronological abridgments: in which, without stopping at detached facts, he attends only to those which form a chain of events that perfect or alter the government and character of a nation, and traces only the springs which exalt or humble a nation, extending or contracting the space it occupies in the world. His work has had the fortune of those literary phenomena, where novelty and merit united excite minds eager after glory, and fire the ardour of young writers to press after a guide whom few can overtake. The first edition of the work, the result of 40 years reading, appeared in 1744, under the auspices of the chancellor Daguier, with the modest title of an Essay. The success it met with surprised him. He made continual improvements in it, and it has gone through nine editions, and been translated into Italian, English, and German, and even into Chinese. As the best writings are not secure from criticism, and are indeed the only ones that deserve it, the author read to the academy of Belles Lettres a defence of his abridgment. All the ages and events of the French monarchy being present to his mind, and his imagination and memory being a vast theatre wherein he beheld the different movements and parts of the actors in the several revolutions, he determined to give a specimen of what passed in his own mind, and to reduce into the form of a regular drama one of the periods of French history, the reign of Francis II., which, though happy only by being short, appeared to him one of the most important by its consequences, and most easy to be confined within the stage bounds. His friend the chancellor highly approved the plan, and wished it to be printed. It accordingly went through five editions; the harmony of dates and facts is exactly observed in it, and the passions interlaced without offence to historic truth.\n\nIn 1755, he was chosen an honorary member of the academy of Belles Lettres, being then a member of the academies of Nancy, Berlin, and Stockholm. The queen appointed him superintendent of her house. His natural sprightliness relieved her from the serious attendance on his private morning lectures. The company of persons most distinguished by their wit and birth, a table more celebrated for the choice of the guests than its delicacies, the little comedies fugitively by wit, and executed by reflections, united at his house all the pleasures of an agreeable and innocent life. All the members of this ingenious society contributed to render it agreeable, and the president was not behind any. He composed three comedies: La Petite Meisson, La Jaloux de Soi-même, and Le Reveil d'Epiménide. The subject of the last was the Cretan philosopher, who is pretended to have slept 27 years. He is introduced fancying that he had slept but one night, and astonished at the change in the age of all around him: he mistakes his mistress for his mother; but discovering his mistake, offers to marry her, which she refuses, though he still continues to love her. The queen was particularly pleased with this piece. She ordered the president to restore the philosopher's mistress to her former youth; he introduced Hebe, and this episode produced an agreeable entertainment. He was now in such favour with her majesty, that on the place of superintendent becoming vacant by the death of M. Bernard de Conbert\nHenley, better known by the appellation of Orator Henley, a very singular character, was born at Melton-Mowbray, Leicestershire, in 1691. His father, the Rev. Simon Henley, and his grandfather by his mother's side (John Dowel, M.A.), were both vicars of that parish. Having passed his exercises at Cambridge, and his examination for the degree of B.A. with the particular approbation of Mr Field, Mr Smales, and the master of the college, he returned to his native place, where he was first desired by the trustees of the school in Melton to assist in, and then to take the direction of, that school; which he increased and raised from a declining to a flourishing condition. He established here a practice of improving elocution by the public speaking of passages in the classics, morning and afternoon, as well as orations, &c. Here he was invited by a letter from the Rev. Mr Newcombe to be a candidate for a fellowship in St John's; but as he had long been absent, and therefore lessened his personal interest, he declined appearing for it. Here likewise he began his \"Universal Grammar,\" and finished ten languages, with dissertations prefixed, as the most ready introduction, to any tongue whatever. In the beginning of this interval he wrote his poem on \"Either,\" which was approved by the town, and well received. He was ordained a deacon by Dr Wake, then bishop of Lincoln; and after having taken his degree of M.A. was admitted to priest's orders by Dr Gibbon, his successor in that see. He formed an early resolution to improve himself in all the advantages of books and conversation the most effectually, on the first opportunity, at London. But he laid the basis of future proficiency in afflicting at the curacy of his native town; where he preached many occasional sermons, particularly one at the assizes at Leicester: he then gave a voluntary warning for the choice of a new master and curate, and came to town recommended by above 30 letters from the most considerable men in the country, both of the clergy and laity; but against the inclination of his neighbours and his school, which was now, as from his first entrance upon it, still advancing: and his method being established and approved, one of his own scholars was appointed to succeed him.—In town he published several pieces, as a translation of Pliny's Epistles, of several works of Abbé Vertot, of Montfaucon's Italian Travels in folio, and many other lucubrations. His most generous patron was the earl of Macclesfield, who gave him a benefice in the country, the value of which to a resident would have been above £80. a year; he had likewise a lecture in the city; and preached more charity sermons about town, was more numerously followed, and raised more for the poor children, than any other preacher, however dignified or distinguished. But when he pressed his desire and promise from a great man of being fixed in town, it palled in the negative. He took the people (it seems) too much from their parish-churches; and as he was not so proper for a London divine, he was very welcome, notwithstanding all difficulties, to be a rural parlor. But it was not for a second residence, as he informs us, that he left the fields and the swains of Oratory, Arcadia to visit the great city: and as he knew it was Tranquill as lawful to take a licence from the king and parlia., P. 17, &c.\n\nMr Henley, in answer to a cavil (that he borrowed from books), proposed, \"that if any person would single out any celebrated discourse of an approved writer, dead or living, and point out what he thought excellent in it, and the reasons; he would submit it to the world, whether the most famed composition might not be\nHenley be surpassed in their own excellency, either on that or any different subject.\"\n\nHenley preached on Sundays upon theological matters, and on Wednesdays upon all other sciences. He declaimed some years against the greatest persons, and occasionally, says Warburton, did Pope that honour. The poet in return thus blazon him to infamy:\n\nBut where each science lifts its modern type,\nHistory her pot, Divinity his pipe,\nWhile proud Philosophy repines to show,\nDishonour fight! his breeches rent below;\nImbrown'd with native bronze, lo Henley stands,\nTuning his voice, and balancing his hands.\nHow fluent nonsense trickles from his tongue!\nHow sweet the periods, neither said nor sung!\nStill break the benches, Henley! with thy strain,\nWhile Kennet, Hare, and Gibbon preach in vain.\nO great restorer of the good old stage,\nPreacher at once and zany of thy age!\nO worthy thou of Egypt's wife abode,\nA decent priest where monkeys were the gods!\nBut Fate with butchers plac'd thy prieftly stall,\nMeek modern faith to murder, hack, and maul:\nAnd bade thee live, to crown Britannia's praise,\nIn Toland's, Tindal's, and in Woolfson's days.\"\n\nThis extraordinary person (who died October 14, 1756) struck medals, which he dispersed as tickets to his subscribers: a star rising to the meridian, with this motto, Ad summum; and below, Inveniam viam aut faciam. Each auditor paid 1s. He was author of a weekly paper called The Hyp Doctor, for which he had 100l. a-year. Henley used every Saturday to print an advertisement in the Daily Advertiser, containing an account of the subjects he intended to discourse on the ensuing evening at his oratory near Lincoln's-inn-fields, with a fort of motto before it, which was generally a sneer at some public transaction of the preceding week. Dr Cobden, one of Geo. II.'s chaplains, having, in 1748, preached a sermon at St James's from these words, \"Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness,\" it gave so much displeasure, that the Doctor was struck out of the list of chaplains; and the next Saturday the following parody of his text appeared as a motto to Henley's advertisement:\n\nAway with the wicked before the king,\nAnd away with the wicked behind him;\nHis throne it will blest\nWith righteousness,\nAnd we shall know where to find him.\"\n\nHis audience was generally composed of the lowest ranks; and it is well-known that he even collected an infinite number of shoe-makers, by announcing that he could teach them a speedy mode of operation in their business, which proved only to be, the making of shoes by cutting off the tops of ready-made boots.\n\nHENNA, or ALHENNA.

It is bounded on the north by Thuringia, on the west by Hesse, on the south by the bishopric of Wertheim, and on the east by that of Bamberg.

It was procured of the emperor by means of Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, with the affluence of the friends of Peter Mongas and Peter Trullo. The fling of this edict lies here; that it repeats and confirms all that had been enacted in the councils of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, against the Arians, Nestorians, and Eutychians, without making any particular mention of the council of Chalcedon. It is in form of a letter, addressed by Zeno to the bishops, priests, monks, and people of Egypt and Libya.

For this purpose he left Lausanne in Switzerland, and removing from different places, at length settled at Thoulouse in the year 1147, and there exercised his ministerial function, till being overcome by the opposition of Bernard abbot of Clairvaux, and condemned by Pope Eugenius III. at a council assembled at Rheims, he was committed to a close prison in 1148, where he soon ended his days. This reformer rejected the baptism of infants; severely censured the corrupt manners of the clergy; treated the festivals and ceremonies of the church with the utmost contempt, and held clandestine assemblies for inculcating his peculiar doctrines.\n\nHENRY, or CAPE-HENRY, the south cape of Virginia, at the entrance of Chesapeake bay. W. Long. 74. 50. N. Lat. 37. 0.\n\nHENRY, the name of several emperors of Germany, and kings of England and France. See ENGLAND, FRANCE, and GERMANY.\n\nHENRY IV. emperor of Germany in 1056, styled the Great, was memorable for his quarrels with Pope Gregory II., whom at one time he deposed, for having presumed to judge his sovereign; but at another, dreading the effects of the papal anathemas, he had the weakness to submit to the most humiliating personal solicitations and penances to obtain absolution; which impolitic measure increased the power of the pope, and alienated the affections of his subjects; thus circumstanced, he reassembled the hero, but too late; marched with an army to Rome, expelled Gregory, deposed him, and set up another pope. Gregory died soon after: but Urban II. and Paschal II. successively, excited his ambitious sons, Conrad and Henry, to rebel against him, and the latter was crowned emperor by the title of Henry V. in 1106; and he had the inhumanity to arrest his father, and to de-\nprive him, not only of all his dignities, but even of the necessaries of life. The unfortunate Henry IV. was reduced to such extremities (after having fought 62 battles in defence of the German empire), that he solicited the bishop of Spire to grant him an under-chancellor's place in his cathedral, but was refused. He died the same year at Liege, aged 55, a martyr to the ignorance and superstition of the age; and to his own blind confidence in favourites and mistresses.\n\nHenry IV., king of France (in 1589) and Navarre, justly styled the Great, was the son of Anthony de Bourbon, chief of the branch of Bourbon (so called from a fief of that name which fell to them by marriage with the heiress of the estate). His mother was the daughter of Henry d'Albert, king of Navarre; a woman of a masculine genius; intrepid, simple, and rustic in her manners, but deeply versed in politics, and a zealous Protestant. Foreseeing that her party would want such a protector (for her husband was a weak indolent prince), she undertook the care of the education of the young hero; his diet was coarse; his clothes neat, but plain; he always went bare-headed; he sent him to school with the other children of the same age, and accustomed him to climb the rocks and neighbouring mountains, according to the custom of the country. He was born in 1553; and in 1569, the 16th year of his age, he was declared the Defender and Chief of the Protestants at Rochelle. The peace of St Germain, concluded in 1570, recalled the lords in the Protestant interest to court; and in 1572 Henry was married to Margaret de Valois, sister to Charles IX., king of France. It was in the midst of the rejoicings for these nuptials that the horrid massacre of Paris took place. Henry was reduced, by this infernal stroke of false policy, to the alternative of changing his religion or being put to death: he chose the former, and was detained prisoner of state three years. In 1587 he made his escape; put himself at the head of the Huguenot party, exposing himself to all the risks and fatigues of a religious war, often in want of the necessaries of life, and enduring all the hardships of the common soldiers; but he gained a victory this year at Courtras, which established his reputation in arms, and endeared him to the Protestants. On the death of Henry III., religion was urged as a pretext for one half of the officers of the French army to reject him, and for the leaguers not to acknowledge him. A phantom, the cardinal de Bourbon, was set up against him; but his most formidable rival was the duke de Mayenne: however, Henry, with few friends, fewer important places, no money, and a very small army, supplied every want by his activity and valour. He gained several victories over the duke; particularly that of Ivry in 1590, memorable for his heroic admonition to his soldiers: \"If you love your ensigns, rally by my white plume; you will always find it in the road to honour and glory.\" Paris held out against him, notwithstanding his successes: he took all the suburbs in one day; and might have reduced the city by famine, if he had not humanely suffered his own army to relieve the besieged; yet the bigotted friars and priests in Paris all turned soldiers, except four of the Mendicant order; and made daily military reviews and processions, the sword in one hand and the crucifix in the other, on which they made the citizens swear rather to die with famine than to admit Henry. The scarcity of provisions in Paris at last degenerated to an universal famine; bread had been sold, whilst any remained, for a crown the pound, and at last it was made from the bones of the charnel-house of St Innocents; human flesh became the food of the obstinate Parisians, and mothers ate the dead bodies of their children. In fine, the duke of Mayenne, seeing that neither Spain nor the league would ever grant him the crown, determined to afflit in giving it to the lawful heir. He engaged the states to hold a conference with the chiefs of both parties; which ended in Henry's abjuration of the Protestant religion at St Dennis, and his consecration at Chartres in 1593. The following year Paris opened its gates to him; in 1596, the duke of Mayenne was pardoned; and in 1598, peace was concluded with Spain. Henry now showed himself doubly worthy of the throne, by his encouragement of commerce, the fine arts, and manufactures, and by his patronage of men of ingenuity and sound learning of every country: but though the fermentations of Roman bigotry were calmed, the leaven was not destroyed; scarce a year passed without some attempt being made on this real father of his people; and at last the monster Ravaillac stabbed him to the heart in his coach, in the streets of Paris, on the 14th of May 1610, in the 57th year of his age and 22d of his reign.\n\nHenry VIII., king of England, was the second son of Henry VII., by Elizabeth the eldest daughter of Edward IV. He was born at Greenwich, on the 28th of June 1491. On the death of his brother Arthur, in 1502, he was created prince of Wales; and the following year betrothed to Catharine of Aragon, Prince Arthur's widow, the pope having granted a dispensation for that purpose. Henry VIII. acceded to the throne, on the death of his father, the 22d of April 1509, and his marriage with Catharine was solemnized about two months after. In the beginning of his reign he left the government of his kingdom entirely to his ministers; and spent his time chiefly in tournaments, balls, concerts, and other expensive amusements. We are told that he was so extravagant in his pleasures, that, in a very short time, he entirely dissipated 1,800,000l., which his father had hoarded. This will seem less wonderful, when the reader is informed, that gaming was one of his favourite diversions. Nevertheless he was not so totally absorbed in pleasure, but he found leisure to sacrifice to the resentment of the people two of his father's ministers, Empson and Dudley. A house in London, which had belonged to the former of these, was in 1510 given to Thomas Wolsey, who was now the king's almoner, and who from this period began to infatuate himself into Henry's favour. In 1513, he became prime minister, and from that moment governed the king and kingdom with absolute power. In this year Henry declared war against France, gained the battle of Spurs, and took the towns of Terouenne and Tournay; but before he embarked his troops, he beheaded the earl of Suffolk, who had been long confined in the tower. In 1521, he sacrificed the duke of Buckingham to the resentment of his prime minister Wolsey, and the same year obtained from the pope the title of Defender of the Faith.\nHenry, having been 18 years married, grew tired of his wife, and in the year 1527 resolved to obtain a divorce; but after many fruitless solicitations, finding it impossible to persuade the pope to annul his marriage with Catherine, he espoused Anne Boleyn in the year 1531. During this interval his favourite Wolley was disgraced, and died; Henry threw off the papal yoke, and burnt three Protestants for heresy. In 1535, he put to death Sir Thomas More, Fisher, and others, for denying his supremacy, and suppressed all the lesser monasteries.\n\nHis most sacred majesty, having now possessed his second queen about five years, fell violently in love with Lady Jane Seymour. Anne Boleyn was accused of adultery with her own brother, and with three other persons; she was beheaded the 19th of May 1536. He married Jane Seymour the day following. In 1537, he put to death five of the noble family of Kildare, as a terror to the Irish, of whose disloyalty he had some apprehensions; and in the year following he executed the marquis of Exeter, with four other persons of distinction, for the sole crime of corresponding with Cardinal Pole. In 1538 and 1539, he suppressed all the monasteries in England, and seized their revenues for his own use. The queen having died in childbirth, he this year married the princess Ann of Cleves; but disliking her person, immediately determined to be divorced; and his obsequious parliament and convocation unanimously pronounced the marriage void, for reasons too ridiculous to be recited: but this was not all; Henry was so incensed with his minister and quondam favourite, Cromwell, for negotiating this match, that he revenged himself by the hand of the executioner. Yet this was not the only public murder of the year 1540. A few days after Cromwell's death, several persons were burnt for denying the king's supremacy, and other articles of heresy.\n\nHis majesty being once more at liberty to indulge himself with another wife, fixed upon Catharine Howard, niece to the duke of Norfolk. She was declared queen in August 1540; but they had been privately married some time before. Henry, it seems, was so entirely satisfied with this lady, that he daily blessed God for his present felicity; but that felicity was of short duration: he had not been married above a year, before the queen was accused of frequent prostitution, both before and since her marriage: she confessed her guilt, and was beheaded in February 1542. In July 1543, he married his fifth wife, the lady Catharine Parr, the widow of John Nevil lord Latimer, and lived to the year 1547 without committing any more flagrant enormities: but finding himself now approach towards dissolution, he made his will; and that the last scene of his life might resemble the rest, he determined to end the tragedy with the murder of two of his best friends and most faithful subjects, the duke of Norfolk and his son the earl of Surrey. The earl was beheaded on the 19th of January; and the duke was ordered for execution on the 29th; but fortunately escaped by the king's death on the 28th. They were condemned without the shadow of a crime; but Henry's political reason for putting them to death, was his apprehension that, if they were suffered to survive him, they would counteract some of his regulations in religion, and might be troublesome to his son. Henry died on the 28th of January 1547, in the 56th year of his age, and was buried at Windsor.\n\nAs to his character, it is pretty obvious from the facts above related. Lord Herbert palliates his crimes, and exaggerates what he calls his virtues. Bishop Burnet says, \"he was rather to be reckoned among the great than the good princes.\" He afterwards acknowledges, that \"he is to be numbered among the ill princes;\" but adds, \"I cannot rank him with the worst.\" Sir Walter Raleigh, with infinitely more justice, says, \"If all the pictures and patterns of a merciless prince were lost to the world, they might again be painted to the life out of the history of this king.\" He was indeed a merciless tyrant, a feckless politician, a foolish bigot, a horrible assasin. See ENGLAND, No 253—292.\n\nHENRY of Huntingdon, an English historian, of the 12th century, was canon of Lincoln, and afterwards archdeacon of Huntingdon. He wrote, 1. A history of England, which ends with the year 1154. 2. A continuation of that of Bede. 3. Chronological tables of the kings of England. 4. A small treatise on the contempt of the world. 5. Several books of epigrams and love-letters. 6. A poem on herbs; all which are written in Latin.—His invocation of Apollo and the goddesses of Tempe, in the exordium of his poem on herbs, may not be unacceptable as a specimen of his poetry.\n\n\"Vatum magne parentis, herbarum Phoebe repertor,\nVosque, quibus resonat Tempis jocosa, Dece!\nSi mihi ferta pruis hederia florente paraltis,\nEcce meos flores, ferta parata fero.\"\n\nHENRY of Sufia, in Latin de Sugyfo, a famous civilian and canonist of the 13th century, acquired such reputation by his learning, that he was called the source and splendour of the law. He was archbishop of Embrun about the year 1258, and cardinal bishop of Ostia in 1262. He wrote A summary of the canon and civil law; and a commentary on the book of the decrets, composed by order of Alexander IV.\n\nHENRY the Minstrel, commonly called Blind Harry, an ancient Scottish author, distinguished by no particular surname, but well-known as the composer of an historical poem reciting the achievements of Sir William Wallace. This poem continued for several centuries to be in great repute; but afterwards sunk into neglect, until very lately that it has been again released from its obscurity by a very neat and correct edition published at Perth under the inspection and patronage of the earl of Buchan.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the precise time in which this poet lived, or when he wrote his history, as the two authors who mention him speak somewhat differently. Dempster, who wrote in the beginning of the 17th century, says that he lived in the year 1361; but Major, who was born in the year 1446, says that he composed this book during the time of his infancy, which we must therefore suppose to have been a few years posterior to 1446; for if it had been composed that very year, the circumstance would probably have been mentioned. As little can we suppose, from Mr Dempster's words, that Henry was born in 1361; for though he says that he lived in that year, we must naturally\nturally imagine rather that he was then come to the years of maturity, or began to distinguish himself in the world, than that he was only born at that time. The author of the dissertation on his life, prefixed to the new edition of the poem, endeavours to reconcile matters in the following manner: \"It is not indeed impossible that he might be born in or about that year (1361). In the time of Major's infancy he might be about 83 years of age. In that case, it may be supposed that it was the work of his old age to collect and put in order the detached pieces of his history of Wallace, which he had probably composed in those parts of the country where the incidents were said to have happened.\"\n\nWe are entirely ignorant of the family from which Henry was descended; though, from his writings, we should be led to suppose that he had received a liberal education. In them he discovers some knowledge in divinity, classical history, and astronomy, as well as of the languages. In one place he boasts of his celibacy, which seems to indicate his having engaged himself in some of the religious orders of that age. From what Major says further of him, we may suppose his profession to have been that of a travelling bard; though it does not appear that he was skilled in music, or had no other profession than that just mentioned. His being blind from his birth, indeed, makes this not improbable; though even this circumstance is not inconsistent with the supposition of his being a religious mendicant.\n\n\"The particulars (says Major) which he heard related by the vulgar, he wrote in the vulgar verse, in which he excelled. By reciting his histories before princes or great men, he gained his food and raiment, of which he was worthy.\" It is thus probable that he would be a frequent visitor at the Scottish court; and would be made welcome by those great families who could boast of any alliance with the hero himself, or took pleasure in hearing his exploits or those of his companions.\n\nWith regard to the authenticity of his histories, Major informs us only that he \"does not believe everything that he finds in such writings;\" but from other testimonies it appears, that he consulted the very best authorities which could at that time be had. Though, according to the most early account of Henry, it appears to have been at least 56 years after the death of Wallace that Henry was born; yet he is said to have consulted with several of the descendants of those who had been the companions of that hero while he achieved his most celebrated exploits, and who were still capable of ascertaining the veracity of what he published. The principal of these were Wallace of Craigie and Liddle of that Ilk; who, he says, persuaded him to omit in his history a circumstance which ought to have inferred. Besides these, he consulted with the principal people of the kingdom; and he utterly disclaims the idea of having adhered entirely to any unwritten tradition, or having been promised any reward for what he wrote. His chief authority, according to his own account, was a Latin history of the exploits of Sir William, written partly by Mr John Blair and partly by Mr Thomas Gray, who had been the companions of the hero himself. Henry's account of these two authors, is to the following purpose: \"They became acquainted with Wallace when the latter was only about 16 years of age, and at that time a student at the school of Dundee; and their acquaintance with him continued till his death, which happened in his 29th year. Mr John Blair went from the schools in Scotland to Paris, where he studied some time, and received priest's orders. He returned to Scotland in 1296, where he joined Wallace, who was bravely afflicting the liberties of his country. Mr Thomas Gray, who was parson of Libberton, joined Wallace at the same time. They were men of great wisdom and integrity, zealous for the freedom of Scotland; and were present with Wallace, and afflicting to him, in most of his military enterprises. They were also his spiritual counsellors, and administered to him godly comfort. The history written by these two clergymen was attested by William Sinclair bishop of Dunkeld, who had himself been witness to many of Wallace's actions. The bishop, if he had lived longer, was to have sent their book to Rome, for the purpose of obtaining the sanction of the pope's authority.\"\n\nThe book which Henry thus appeals to as his principal authority is now lost, so that we have no opportunity of comparing it with what he has written. The character given by Dempster of Henry, however, is more favourable than that by Major. He tells us, that \"he was blind from his birth; a man of singular happy genius; he was indeed another Homer. He did great honour to his native country, and raised it above what was common to it in his age. He wrote, in the vernacular verse, an elaborate and grand work, in ten books, of the deeds of William Wallace.\" In this account there is a mistake; for the poem contains eleven or twelve books; but Dempster, who wrote in a foreign country, and had not a printed copy of Henry's work by him when he wrote his eulogium, is excusable in a mistake of this kind.\n\nWith regard to his poetical merit, it must undoubtedly rank very far below that of Homer, whom indeed he scarcely resembles in any other respects than that he went about, as Homer is said to have done, reciting the exploits of the heroes of his country, and that he was blind. In this last circumstance, however, he was still worse than Homer; for Henry was born blind, but Homer became blind after he had been advanced in years. Hence Henry, even supposing his genius to have been equal to that of Homer, must have lain under great disadvantages; and these are very evident in his works. The descriptive parts are evidently deficient, and the allusions taken principally from the way in which nature affects those senses of which he was possessed. Thus, speaking of the month of March, he calls it the month of right digestion, from the supposed fermentation then begun in the earth. Of April he says that the earth is then able, or has obtained a power of producing its different vegetables; and of this productive power he appears to have been more sensible than of the effects which commonly strike us most sensibly. \"By the working of nature (says he), the fields are again clothed, and the woods acquire their worthy weed of green. May brings along with it great celestial gladness. The heavenly hues appear upon the tender green.\" In another place he describes the deity of some river, whom he calls Nymphæus, \"building his bowers with oil and balm, fulfilled of sweet odour;\" by reason of these disadvantages, he seldom makes use of\nof families with which Homer abounds so much; and few miraculous interpositions are to be found in his poem, though the prophecies of Thomas Lermont commonly called The Rhymers, and a prophetic dream of Wallace himself, are introduced, as well as the ghost of Fawdon, a traitor who had joined Wallace, and whom the latter in a fit of passion had killed. In other respects, the same inextinguishable thirst of blood which Homer ascribes to his hero Achilles is ascribed to Wallace, though in all probability the mind of Wallace was too much enlightened to admit of such sentiments. A vast degree of courage and personal strength are ascribed to him, by means of which the exploits of the whole army are in effect transferred to a single person. As long as he is invested with the command, the Scots are victorious and irresistible; when deprived of it, they are enslaved and undone. After struggling for some time against an inveterate and powerful faction, disdaining to feign submission, he is taken by treachery, and died a martyr to the freedom of his country. The poem, on the whole, is valuable, on account of our being able to trace, by its means, the progress which the English language had made at that time in Scotland: the manners of the Scots in that age: as the favourite dress of green which at that time was the taste of the inhabitants of Scotland, &c. With regard to the authenticity of his relations, it is impossible to suppose any other thing than that they are partly true and partly false. The general thread of the story may undoubtedly be looked upon to be genuine, though embellished with poetical fictions and exaggerations; and his constant appeals to the book already mentioned, though it is now lost, must be looked upon as a strong testimony in his favour: for we cannot suppose that at the time he lived, when we may say that the transactions which he relates were recent, he would have had the confidence to appeal to a book which had not been generally known to have an existence; and its being now lost can never be any argument against it, when we consider the difficulty there was of preserving books before the invention of printing; the confusions in which Scotland was frequently involved; and that the exploits of Wallace, who must be supposed to have been a kind of rival to the great Bruce, could not be so agreeable to the court as those of the more successful hero; and therefore the history of them might be suffered to fall into oblivion, though written in elegant Latin, while a most ridiculous poem in that language on the battle of Bannockburn has been preserved to his day.\n\nHENRY Prince of Wales, eldest son of King James VI. of Scotland by his queen Anne sister of the king of Denmark, and one of the most accomplished princes of the age in which he lived, was born on the 19th of February 1594. The birth of the prince was announced by embassies to many foreign powers, with invitations to be present at the ceremony of his baptism, which was thus delayed for a considerable time. Mr Peter Young, who, along with the celebrated George Buchanan, had been preceptor to his majesty, was sent to the courts of Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenburg, the duke of Mecklenburgh being great-grandfather to the prince by the mother's side; the laird of East Weems to France and England; and Sir Robert Keith, and Captain Murray provost of St Andrew's, to the States General, who at that time were struggling against the Spanish tyranny, and not yet declared a free state. All these ambassadors were cordially received, and others appointed in return except by the courts of France and England. Henry IV., at that time king of France, though the Scots ambassador had formerly been one of his own servants, neither made any protest, nor appointed an ambassador. Queen Elizabeth had designed to act in the same manner till the heard of the behaviour of Henry; after which she honoured James by appointing an ambassador of very high rank, Robert earl of Sussex. This ambassador, however, was so long of making his appearance, that the queen imagined the ceremony would be over before his arrival; for which reason she sent a message to the earl, commanding him in that case not to enter Scotland nor deliver her present. But James had been more obsequious; and not only delayed the ceremony till the English ambassador arrived, but distinguished him from the rest by having a canopy carried over his head at the procession, supported by the lairds of Cessford, Buccleugh, Duddope, and Traquair. The ceremony was performed with great magnificence; after which the ambassadors presented their gifts. That from the United States was the most valuable; it consisted of two gold cups worth 12,400 crowns, with a box of the same metal, weighing in all about 400 ounces, containing besides the grant of a pension of 500 florins annually to the prince for life. The English ambassador gave a cupboard of plate curiously wrought, and valued at 3,000 sterling; and the Danish ambassador two gold chains, one for the queen and another for the prince. The baptism was celebrated on the 6th of September 1594, and the child named Frederick-Henry and Henry-Frederick.\n\nThe young prince was now committed to the care of the earl of Mar, who was assisted in this important charge by Annabella countess-dowager of Mar, daughter of William Murray of Tullibardine, and paternal ancestor of the present duke of Athol. This lady was remarkable for the severity of her temper, so that the prince met with little indulgence while under her tuition; notwithstanding which, he showed great affection for his governess all the time she had the care of him. Next year, however (1595), the queen engaged the chancellor, Lord Thirlstane, in a scheme to get the prince into her own power; but the king having found means to dissuade her majesty from the attempt, showed afterwards such marks of displeasure to the chancellor, that the latter fell into a languishing disorder and died of grief.\n\nIn his fifth year Prince Henry was committed to the care of Mr Adam Newton a Scotman, eminently skilled in most branches of literature, but particularly distinguished for his knowledge of the Latin language. Under his tutelage the prince soon made great progress in that language, as well as in other branches of knowledge; inasmuch that before he had completed his fifth year, his father wrote for his use the treatise entitled Basilicon Doron, thought to be the best of all his works.\n\nIn his seventh year, Prince Henry began his correspondence with foreign powers. His first letter was to the States of Holland; in which he expressed his regard and gratitude for the good opinion they had conceived of him, and of which he had been informed by\nby several persons who had visited that country; concluding with a request that they would make use of his interest with his father in whatever he could serve them, promising also his service in every other respect in which he could be useful, until he should be able to give farther instances of his good-will and affection.\n\nAt this early period the prince began to add to his literary accomplishments some of the more martial kind, such as riding, the exercise of the bow, pike, &c., as well as the use of fire-arms; and indeed such was the attachment he showed throughout his whole lifetime to military exercises, that had he attained the years of maturity, there can scarce be a doubt that he would have distinguished himself in a most eminent manner. In all his exercises he made surprising progress; and not only in those of the military kind, but in fencing, dancing, &c. On his ninth birthday he sent a letter in Latin to the king, informing him that he had read over Terence's Hecyra, the third book of Phaedrus's Fables, and two books of Cicero's Epistles; and that now he thought himself capable of performing something in the commendatory kind of epistles. His accomplishments were soon spoken of in foreign countries; and these, along with the general suspicion that James favoured the Catholic party, probably induced Pope Clement VIII. to make an attempt to get him into his hands. With this view he proposed, that if James would entrust him with the education of the young prince, he would advance such sums of money as would effectually establish him on the throne of England. This happened a little before the death of Elizabeth; but James, notwithstanding his ambition to possess the crown of England, of which he was not yet altogether certain, withstood the temptation. He alleged, that it would be unnatural for him, as a father, to allow his son to be brought up in the belief of a doctrine which he himself did not believe; and even though he should act in his private capacity in such an unnatural manner, he could not answer for it to the nation, he being heir-apparent to the crown, and the kingdom at large much interested in whatever concerned him. On the death of the queen of England, James was obliged to leave Scotland in such haste, that he had not time to take a personal leave of his son, and therefore did so by letter, which was answered by the prince in Latin. The queen, however, who had been desired to follow the king to London in three weeks, but to leave the prince in Scotland, thought proper to make another attempt to get her son into her own power. With this view she took a journey to Stirling, where the prince resided, but was opposed in her designs by the friends of the house of Mar; and this affected her so much, that she miscarried of a child of which she was then pregnant. The king, hearing of this misfortune, ordered the prince to be delivered to his mother; but refused to inflict any punishment on the earl of Mar, which the queen insisted upon, that nobleman having been with the king at London, and entirely innocent of the whole affair. Instead of punishing him, therefore, he caused him to be acquitted by an act of the public council at Stirling; invested him with the order of the garter; made him a grant of several abbey and other church-lands; and raised him to the post of lord high treasurer after the disgrace of the earl of Somerset; in which employment he continued till he could no longer perform the duties of his office through age and infirmity.\n\nIn the month of July this year (1603) Prince Henry was invested with the order of the garter; after which he was presented to the queen in his robes, and greatly commended by all who saw him on account of his majestic carriage and religious behaviour at the altar, as well as the quickness of his understanding and ready answers. Being obliged to leave London on account of the plague, he retired to Otehlands, a royal palace near Weybridge in Surrey, where a separate household was appointed for him and his sister Elizabeth. The appointment consisted of first of 70 servants, of whom 22 were to be above stairs and 48 below. In some weeks the number was augmented to 104, of whom 51 were above stairs and 53 below; but before the end of the year they were augmented to 141, of whom 56 were above stairs and 85 below. From Otehlands he removed the same year to Nonsuch in Surrey, and from thence to Hampton Court, where he resided till Michaelmas 1604; after which he returned to his house at Otehlands, his servants having all this time been kept on board wages.\n\nIn the tenth year of his age, Henry began to show a wonderful desire of becoming master of all those accomplishments which are necessary to constitute a great prince. Without detracting from his attention to polite literature, he applied himself in the most assiduous manner to the knowledge of naval and military affairs. To give him the first rudiments of the former, a small vessel was constructed 28 feet long and 12 broad, curiously painted and carved; on board of which he embarked with several of the principal nobility, and sailed down as far as Paul's Wharf, where, with the usual ceremonies, he baptized it by the name of the Deydam. Mr Pett, the builder of this ship, was recommended to the prince by the high admiral in such strong terms, that his highness took him immediately into his service, and continued his favour to him as long as he lived.\n\nPrince Henry now began to show himself equally a patron of military men and of learning. His martial disposition induced him to take notice of Colonel Edmondson, a brave Scots officer in the Dutch service, who had raised himself solely by his merit. To him he applied for a suit of armour to be sent over from Holland; but though the colonel executed his commission, he reaped no benefit from his highness's favour, dying in a short time after the armour was purchased, before he had any opportunity of fending it over. In matters of literature the prince appears to have been a very good judge. He patronized divines, and appears to have been naturally of a religious turn of mind. His attachment to the Protestant religion appears to have been excessive; as it never was in the power of the queen, who favoured the Catholic party, to make the least impression upon him. Her machinations for this purpose were discovered by the French ambassador; who, in a letter dated June 7, 1604, informed his master of them, and that the Spaniards were in hopes of being able by her means to alter the religion in England, as well as to prejudice the prince against France, which the queen said she hoped that her son would one day be able to conquer like another Henry V. By another letter, of date 22d October the same\nsame year, the ambassador, after taking notice of the queen's immoderate ambition, adds, that she used all her efforts to corrupt the mind of the prince, by flattering his passions, diverting him from his studies, and representing to him, out of contempt to his father, that learning was inconsistent with the character of a great general and conqueror; proposing at the same time a marriage with the infanta of Spain. Notwithstanding these remonstrances, however, the prince continued to behave as usual, and to patronise the learned no less than before. He presented John Johnston, one of the king's professors at St Andrew's with a diamond, for having dedicated to him an Historical Description of the kings of Scotland from the foundation of the monarchy to that time; after which the professor added a carmen encomiasticum, which was transmitted to his highness in November 1605. Many other authors also sought and obtained his countenance. In 1606 Mr John Bond ushered his edition of Horace into the world with a polite dedication to the prince, whom he highly compliments on account of the progress he had made in learning. In 1609 a book was sent over to him from France by Sir George Carew, the British ambassador there, tending to disprove the doctrine of the Catholics concerning the church of Rome being the first of the Christian churches. The same year the learned Thomas Lydyat published his Emendatio Temporum, which appeared under the patronage of the prince; and with this performance his highness was so well pleased, that he took the author into his family to read to him, and made him his chronographer and cosmographer. Paul Buys or Buhus also sent him a letter with a dedication of the second part of his Panegyts; in which he bestows upon him the highest compliments on the great expectations which were formed of him, and of the hopes entertained by the reformed Christian churches that he would prove a powerful support to their cause, and antagonist to the errors of Rome. In 1611 Dr Tooker, in his dedication of an Answer to Becanus a Jesuit, who had written against a piece done by his majesty himself, styles his highness \"the Meccenas of all the learned.\" Another treatise against the same Becanus was also printed this year, and dedicated to the prince.\n\nMany other authors, whom our limits will not allow us to take notice of, were fond of dedicating their performances to his highness; nor was his correspondence less extensive than his erudition. We have already taken notice of his having written his first public letter to the States of Holland. He was congratulated by the elector palatine, afterwards married to the princess Elizabeth, on the discovery of the gunpowder-plot. On the same occasion also Lord Spencer wrote him a letter, accompanying it with the present of a sword and target; \"instruments (says he) fit to be about you in those treacherous times; from the which, I trust, God will ever protect your most royal father, &c.\" Previous to this he had corresponded in Latin with the doge of Venice, the landgrave of Hesse, and the king of Denmark; in French with the duke of Savoy, and in Latin with the duke of Brunswick and Vladislaus king of Poland; besides a number of other eminent persons too tedious to enumerate.\n\nThe great accomplishments of Henry soon caused him to be taken notice of by the most eminent princes in Europe. In 1606 Henry IV. of France ordered his ambassador to pay him special regard on all occasions. He desired him likewise to salute the prince in the name of the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII., and to inform him of the regard the latter had for him. A message was also sent by the same ambassador to M. de St Antoine, appointed to be riding-master to his highness, enjoining him to do his duty in that office; and affiriming that his majesty would be as much pleased with it as if the service had been done to himself. To these messages the prince returned very proper answers; and afterwards performed his exercise in the riding-school before the ambassador himself, that the latter might send an account thereof to his master. On this occasion he mounted two horses, and acquitted himself so well that the ambassador in a letter to M. de Villeroi, the French secretary, gave him the character of \"a prince who promised very much, and whose friendship could not but be one day of advantage.\" Having then set forth the propriety of cultivating a good understanding with him, he tells the secretary, that the dauphin might make a return for some dogs which the prince had sent him, by a suit of armour well gilt and enamelled, together with pistols and a sword of the same kind; also two horses, one of them a barb. This year also the prince waited on his uncle the king of Denmark, who had come to England on a visit to King James; and this monarch was so much pleased with his company, that he presented him at parting with his vice-admiral and best fighting ship, valued at no less than 2500l. also with a rapier and hanger, valued at 2000 marks. The states of Holland were equally ready to show their attachment. On the 23rd of August this year they sent a letter to the prince in French, accompanied with the present of a set of table linen, which they thought, as being the produce of their own country, would be agreeable to him; and they requested his love and favour towards their state; in return for which they promised to be always ready to show their regard for him, and to do him all possible service; as the ambassador himself was ordered more particularly to declare. About this time the prince himself wrote a letter to Henry IV. acknowledging the kindness which his majesty had shown him for several years, and confirmed of late by the latter offering him under his own royal hand his friendship and that of the dauphin.\n\nWhile James was this year employed in hunting, the French ambassador, who had been obliged to quit London on account of the plague, took frequent opportunities of waiting upon his highness, as did also the Spanish ambassador, whose offensive reason was to inform him about some horses which were to be sent him from Spain. The prince's partiality towards France, however, was so evident, that the French ambassador, in a letter dated 31st October 1606, mentions, that \"as far as he could discover, his highness's inclination was entirely towards France, and that it would be wrong to neglect a prince who promised such great things. None of his pleasures (continued he) favour the least of a child. He is a particular lover of horses and whatever belongs to them; but is not fond of hunting; and when he goes to it, it is rather for the pleasure of galloping than that which the dogs give him. He plays willingly enough at tennis, and another Scottish diversion...\"\ndiversion very like mall; but this always with persons elder than himself, as if he despised those of his own age. He studies two hours a-day, and employs the rest of his time in toiling the pike, or leaping, or shooting with the bow, or throwing the bar, or vaulting, or some other exercise of the kind, and he is never idle. He shows himself likewise very good-natured to his dependents, supports their interests against any persons whatever, and pushes whatever he undertakes for them or others with such zeal as gives success to it. For besides his exerting his whole strength to compass what he desires, he is already feared by those who have the management of affairs, and especially by the earl of Salisbury, who appears to be greatly apprehensive of the prince's ascendancy; as the prince, on the other hand, shows little esteem for his lordship.\n\nIn this letter the ambassador further goes on to remark, that some of the prince's attendants had formerly been made to expect pensions from France; and he was of opinion that they ought to be gratified on account of the interest they had with the prince. He adds, that the queen had less affection for Prince Henry than for his brother the duke of York, afterwards Charles I.; which the prince feared to have discovered, and sometimes used expressions to that purpose: that the king also seemed to be jealous of his son's accomplishments, and to be displeased with the quick progress he made.\n\nIn 1627 the prince received the arms and armour which Henry IV. sent him as a present; and these being accompanied with a letter, the prince returned an answer by a Mr Douglas, who was introduced to the king of France by the ambassador Sir George Carew. His majesty, contrary to custom, opened the prince's letter immediately; and was so much surprised at the beauty of the character, that he could not be satisfied that it was the prince's hand until he compared the signature with the rest of the writing. In his letter to the British court on this occasion, the ambassador sets forth in strong terms the affection expressed by the French monarch for the prince; \"accounting of him as of his own son, as he hoped that his good brother of Great Britain would do the like of the dauphin.\"\n\nThe French ambassador also gave a character of his highness similar to that already mentioned; remarking, \"that the prince had great accomplishments and courage; would soon make himself talked of, and politely give jealousy to his father, and apprehensions to those who had the greatest ascendancy at court.\" With regard to the pensions to his attendants, he was at first of opinion that they ought to be granted; but afterwards altered his mind, perceiving that there was little probability of the prince being influenced by any of his attendants, as he was much more inclined to be guided by his own judgment than by the suggestions of others.\n\nIn the month of July this year the Dutch ambassadors came recommended to Prince Henry by the States, who wrote to him that they had ordered their ambassadors to kiss his highness's hands on their part, and desired him to continue his friendship to their republic, and to allow their ambassadors a favourable audience, and the same credit as to themselves.\n\nAll this attention paid him by foreign powers, all his attention to his own improvements in learning and the military art, and all the temptations which we cannot but suppose a youth in his exalted station to have been exposed to, seem never to have shaken the mind of this magnanimous prince in the least, or to have at any time made him deviate from the strict line of propriety. We have already mentioned his attachment to the Protestant religion; and this appears not to have been grounded upon any prejudice or opinion inculcated upon his infant mind by those who had the care of him, but from a thorough conviction of the truth of the principles which he professed. On the discovery of the gunpowder-plot, he was so impressed with gratitude towards the Supreme Being, that he never afterwards omitted being present at the sermon preached on the occasion. In his 14th year the prince showed himself capable of distinguishing the merit of religious discourses, and paid particular regard to such divines as were most remarkable for their learning and abilities. Among others, he honoured with his attention the learned and eloquent Mr Joseph Hall, then rector of Halstead in Suffolk, afterwards dean of Worcester, and successively bishop of Exeter and Norwich. His highness was so much pleased with a book of Meditations published by that divine, that he pressed him to preach before him; and having heard two of his sermons, he engaged him as one of his chaplains; inviting him afterwards to stay constantly at his court, while the other chaplains waited only in their turns; promising, moreover, to obtain from the king such preferments as should fully satisfy him. Mr Hall, however, from a reluctance to leave his new patron Lord Denny afterwards earl of Norwich, did not accept of these honourable and advantageous proposals.\n\nIn his family the prince took the utmost care to preserve decency and regularity. He ordered boxes to be kept at his three houses of St James's, Richmond, and Nunwich, for the money required of those who were heard to swear; the fines levied on such offenders being given to the poor. He had, indeed, a particular aversion to the vice of swearing and profanation of the name of God. When at play, he never was heard to do so; and on being asked why he did not swear at play as well as others; he answered, that he knew no game worthy of an oath. The same answer he is said to have given at a hunting-match. The stag, almost quite spent, crossed a road where a butcher was pasturing with his dog. The stag was instantly killed by the dog; at which the huntmen were greatly offended, and endeavoured to irritate the prince against the butcher; but his highness answered coolly, \"What if the butcher's dog killed the stag, what could the butcher help it? They replied, that if his father had been served, he would have sworn so that no man could have endured. 'Away,' cried the prince, 'all the pleasure in the world is not worth an oath.'\"\n\nThe regard which Prince Henry had for religion was manifest from his attachment to those who behaved themselves in a religious and virtuous manner. Among these was Sir John Harrington, whose father had been knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and created by King James a baron of England in 1623 by the title of Lord Harrington of Exton in Rutland. He was entrusted with the care of the princess Elizabeth after her marriage with the elector palatine, whom he attended to Heydelberg in 1613, and died at Worms on the 24th of August following. His son, who in\nthe year 1604 had been created knight of the Bath, was as soon as he came to the years of discretion remarkable for his piety; insomuch that he is said to have kept an exact diary of his life, and to have examined himself every week as to the progress he had made in piety and virtue, and what faults he had committed during that time. He was affable and courteous to all, and remarkable for his humanity to those in distress; all which good qualities so endeared him to the prince, that he entered into as strict a friendship with him as the disproportion between their stations would allow. There are still several letters extant which passed between them, chiefly upon classical subjects. This worthy and accomplished nobleman died in February 1614.\n\nIn his friendship Prince Henry appears to have been very sincere, and inviolably attached to those whom he once patronised. He had a great regard for the unfortunate Lady Arabella Stewart, sister of Henry Lord Darnley, the king's father; and there is still extant a letter from this lady to the prince in return for some kindnesses he had bestowed on a kinsman of hers at her recommendation. He expressed much compassion for her misfortunes; she having excited the king's jealousy on account of her marriage with Mr William Seymour, afterwards earl and marquis of Hertford, and restored in 1660 to the dukedom of Somerset. But on her attempting to escape from the house in Highgate where she was confined, and to go abroad with her husband, his highness expressed some resentment against her; though in all probability, his apprehensions, as well as those of the king, were ill-founded.\n\nAs early as the year 1605, the prince, though then only in his 11th year, manifested his gratitude and attachment to those who had served him, in the influence of his tutor Mr Newton already mentioned. That gentleman had been promised by his majesty the deanery of Durham upon the demise of the archbishop of York. On this promise Mr Newton had relied for two years; and as soon as the prelate died, his highness took care to put the king in mind of his promise; in consequence of which, Mr Newton was installed in his office on the 27th of September 1606.\n\nMr Pett, the gentleman who first instructed the prince in naval affairs, having been involved with many others in an enquiry concerning their conduct in their respective employments in the royal navy, the prince showed a laudable desire of protecting their innocence. The inquiry was set on foot by the earl of Northampton, lord privy seal and warden of the cinque ports, who had received a commission from the king for the purpose. It was carried on by his agents, however, with such violence and malice, as not only occasioned great trouble and expense to the parties concerned, but almost ruined the navy, besides augmenting his majesty's expenses much more than formerly. Mr Pett's trial began on the 28th of April 1609; at which time the reports being very favourable to him, the king determined to examine into the state of the matter himself. For this purpose he went to Woolwich on the 8th of May, attended by the prince; and appointed Sir Thomas Chaloner, his highness's governor, and Sir Henry Briggs then professor of geometry in Gresham college, to decide the controversy which was then agitated about the proportion of the ships. The measurers declared in favour of Mr Pett; on which the prince exclaimed, \"Where be now those perjured fellows, that dare thus to abuse his majesty with false informations? Do they not worthily deserve hanging?\" During the whole time he stood near Mr Pett to encourage him; and when the king declared himself satisfied of his innocence, the prince took him up from his knees, expressing his own joy for the satisfaction which his father had received that day; protesting that he would not only countenance Mr Pett for the future, but provide for him and his family as long as he lived.\n\nThe courage, intrepid disposition, and martial turn of this prince, were manifest from his infancy. It is related of Alexander the Great, that at a very early period of his life he showed more skill than all his father's grooms in the breaking of his favourite horse Bucephalus. An anecdote somewhat similar is recorded of Prince Henry. He was hardly ten years of age, when he mounted a very high-spirited horse, in spite of the remonstrances of his attendants; spurred the animal to a full gallop; and having thoroughly wearied him, brought him back at a gentle pace, asking his servants at his return, \"How long shall I continue in your opinion to be a child?\" From the very first time that he embarked on board the small vessel formerly mentioned, he continued to pay the utmost attention to naval affairs. In August 1607, he visited the royal navy at Woolwich, where he was received by Mr Pett, and conducted aboard the Royal Anne, where he had 31 large pieces of ordnance ready to be fired. This was done unexpectedly as soon as the prince reached the poop; at which he expressed great satisfaction. After visiting the dock-yard, and surveying what was done of a ship then building for himself, he went ashore, and having partaken of an entertainment prepared for him by Mr Pett, he was by him conducted to the mount, where the ordnance were again charged and ready to be placed for firing. The prince insisted upon an immediate discharge, but suffered himself to be persuaded against it by Mr Pett's representation of the danger of firing so many ordnance loaded with shot while his highness stood close by: on a signal given by him, however, by holding up his handkerchief, after he had removed to a proper distance with his barge, the ordnance were discharged as he had desired. In his 16th year he paid several visits to Woolwich, in order to see the above-mentioned ship which was building for himself. When finished, it was the largest that had ever been seen in England: the keel being 114 feet in length, and the cross-beam 44 feet; carrying 64 pieces of great ordnance; the burden about 1400 tons; and the whole curiously ornamented with carving and gilding. His highness having received this ship in a present from his majesty, went to see it launched on the 24th of September 1629. The narrowness of the dock, however, having prevented its being done at that time, the prince, who stood behind the rest of the company in order to prepare for the ceremony next morning, returned by three o'clock through a storm of rain, thunder, and lightning; and standing on the poop while the ship was launched, gave it the name of the Prince Royal.\n\nIn 1611 his highness made a private visit to Chatham,\nHenry, where he first went on board the Prince Royal, and afterwards from ship to ship; informing himself particularly of every thing of moment relating to the state of all the different ships, and even pinnaces lying there at that time. Next day he went by water up to Stroud; where, contrary to all the remonstrances of his attendants, he caused the ordnance to be shot over his barge. From Stroud he went to Gravesend, where the magistrates received him with a discharge of all their small arms and the ordnance of the blockhouses.\n\nAbout the middle of January 1612, Prince Henry ordered all his majesty's master-shipwrights and builders to attend him to consider of a proposition concerning the building of ships in Ireland made by a Mr Burrell. Some of his propositions were, that he should build any ship from 100 to 600 tons, with two decks and an half, at the rate of five pounds per ton; that he would build any ship from 600 to 1000 tons, with three whole decks, at the rate of seven pounds per ton; that he should build a ship of 600 tons within a certain time, &c. Mr Pett was employed to see that this contract was fulfilled on the part of Mr Burrell. Among the prince's papers, a list of the royal navy was found after his death, with an account of all the expenses of fitting out, manning, &c., which must now be accounted a valuable addition to the naval history of those times. His passion for naval affairs naturally led him to a desire of making geographical discoveries; of which, however, only two instances have reached our times. One was in 1607, when he received from Mr Tindal his gunner, who had been employed by the Virginia company, a draught of James's river in that country, with a letter dated 22d June the same year. In this letter Mr Tindal remarks, that his fellow-adventurers had discovered that river; and that no Christian had ever been there before; that they were safely arrived and settled; that they found the country very fruitful; and that they had taken a real and public possession in the name and to the use of the king his highness's father. The other instance was in the year 1612, the same in which he died, when he employed Mr Thomas Button, an eminent mariner, to go in quest of a north-west passage. Mr Button accordingly set sail with two ships named the Resolution and Discovery; the same designations with those in which the late Captain Cook made his last voyage. Both of them were victualled for 18 months: but wintering in these northern regions, they did not return till after the prince's decease, so that Captain Button was never sent on another voyage: nevertheless, he returned fully convinced of the existence of such a passage; and even told the celebrated professor Briggs of Gresham college, that he had convinced the king of his opinion.\n\nThe martial disposition of the prince, which was conspicuous on all occasions, eminently displayed itself on the occasion of his being invested in the principality of Wales and duchy of Cornwall, which took place in the year 1610. Previous to this ceremony, he, under the name and character of Mæliades lord of the isles, caused a challenge to be given, in the romantic style of those times, to all the knights in Great Britain. The challenge, according to custom, was accepted; and on the appointed day, the prince, assisted only by the duke of Lenox, the earls of Arundel and Southampton, Lord Hay, Sir Thomas Somerset, and Sir Richard Preston who instructed his highness in arms, maintained the combat against 56 ears, barons, knights and esquires. Prince Henry himself gave and received 32 passes of the pike, and about 360 strokes of swords, performing his part very gracefully, and to the admiration of all who saw him, he being not yet 16 years of age. Prizes were bestowed upon the earl of Montgomery, Mr Thomas Darry, and Sir Robert Gordon, for their behaviour at this combat. The ceremony of installation was performed on the 4th of June 1610, at which time every kind of magnificence that could be devised was displayed. Among other pageants used on this occasion was that of Neptune riding on a dolphin and making speeches to the prince; also of a sea-goddesse upon a whale. After the ceremony the prince took his place on the left hand of his majesty; sitting there in his royal robes, with the crown on his head, the rod in one hand, and in the other the patent creating him prince of Wales and duke of Cornwall. A public act was then read, testifying that he had been declared prince of Great Britain and Wales. He was afterwards served at table with a magnificence not unworthy of royalty itself; the whole concluding with a grand masquerade and tournament.\n\nIn one instance, the extreme desire which Prince Henry had of being instructed in military affairs, carried him beyond those bounds which European nations have prescribed to one another. In 1607 the prince de Joinville, brother to the duke of Guise, came to England, having been obliged to leave France in consequence of his having made love to the countess de Moret the king's mistress. After having been for a few weeks magnificently entertained at court, he departed for France in the beginning of June. The prince took an opportunity of sending to Calais in the train of the prince an engineer in his own service, who took the opportunity of examining all the fortifications of the town, particularly those of the Rix-Banc. This was discovered by the French ambassador, who immediately gave notice of it to court, but excused the prince, as supposing that what he had done was more out of curiosity than any thing else; and the court seemed to be of the same opinion, as no notice was ever taken of the affair, nor was the friendship between King Henry and the prince in the smallest degree interrupted. The martial disposition of his highness was greatly encouraged by some people in the military line, who put into his hands a paper entitled \"Propositions for War and Peace.\" Notwithstanding this title, however, the aim of the author was evidently to promote war rather than peace; and for this the following arguments were used. 1. Necessity; for the preservation of our own peace, the venting of factious spirits, and instructing the people in arms. 2. The benefits to be derived from the spoils of the enemy, an augmentation of revenue from the conquered countries, &c. This was answered by Sir Robert Cotton in the following manner. 1. That our wisest princes had always been inclined to peace. 2. That foreign expeditions were the causes of invasions from abroad, and rebellions at home, endless taxation, vassalage, and danger to the state from the extent of territory, &c. It does\ndoes not appear, however, that the prince was at all moved by these pacific arguments; on the contrary, his favourite diversions were tilting, charging on horseback with pistols, &c. He delighted in conversing with people of skill and experience in war concerning every part of their profession; caused new pieces of ordnance to be made, with which he learned to shoot at a mark; and was so careful to furnish himself with a breed of good horses, that no prince in Europe could boast of a superiority in this respect. He was solicited by Sir Edward Conway to direct his attention to the affairs of the continent, where Sigismund III. of Poland threatened, in conjunction with the king of Denmark, to attack Gustavus Adolphus the young king of Sweden; but the death of the prince, which happened this year, prevented all interference of this kind.\n\nTo his other virtues Prince Henry added those of frugality without avarice, and generosity without extravagance. As early as the year 1605 he began to show an attention to his interest as duke of Cornwall, and to take proper measures for securing his revenues there. In 1610 he settled and appointed the officers of his household, making his choice with the greatest prudence, and giving orders for the management and regulation of his affairs with all the wisdom and gravity of an old counsellor. Some lands were now allotted to him for his revenues; and instead of diminishing his income during the short time he was in possession of them, they were found at his death to be some thousands of pounds better than when he obtained them. At this time he showed much reluctance to gratify any of his servants except by promises, as not thinking himself yet authorized to give anything away; but a short time before his death, he conferred pensions on some of them; and there is no reason to doubt, that had his life been prolonged he would have rewarded them all according to their merit.\n\nThough Prince Henry never interfered much in public business, yet in any little transactions he had of this kind, he always displayed great firmness and resolution, as well as absolute propriety of conduct. In a letter from Sir Alexander Seton, earl of Dunfermline, he is commended for the firmness and resolution with which he repelled the calumnies of some who \"had rashly, and with the highest intemperance of tongue, endeavoured to wound the Scottish nation.\" By this he alluded to some very gross and furious invectives thrown out against the whole body of the Scots by Sir Christopher Pigot, in a debate in the house of commons on an union between the two kingdoms. This gentleman declared his astonishment at the proposal of uniting a good and fertile country to one poor, barren, and in a manner disgraced by nature; and for associating rich, frank, and honest men, with such as were beggars, proud, and generally traitors and rebels to their kings; with many other shameful expressions of the same kind. His majesty was highly offended with the whole council; and Sir Christopher, after being obliged in parliament to retract his words, was expelled the house and imprisoned; in consequence of which, the king was addressed by the estates of Scotland, who thanked him for the zeal he had manifested for the honour of their country. In another instance, where the prince wished Mr Fullerton, a Scotsman, to supersede Sir Robert Car, one of the attendants of his brother the duke of York, contrary to the inclination of the king and earl of Salisbury, his highness carried his point, by persuading Sir Robert of himself to give up the place in question.\n\nUnder this year, 1611, the elegant Latin historian of Great Britain from 1572 to 1628, Robert Johnston, places a story, which, though unsupported by any authority but his own, and improbable in itself, must not be omitted here. The prince, according to this writer, requested the king that he might be appointed to preside in the council. This demand was seconded by the king's favourite, Car Viscount Rochester, who urged his majesty to lay his son's request before the council. But the earl of Salisbury, jealous of the growing power of Rochester, and a thorough master of artifice and dissimulation, used all his efforts to defeat whatever measures were proposed by his rival; and being asked soon after his opinion upon this point, whether it was for the public interest that the prince should preside in the council; answered, that he thought it dangerous to divide the government, and to invest the son with the authority of the father. Many others of the privy council having delivered their opinions on the same question, that of the earl of Salisbury was adopted by the majority. But his lordship soon took an opportunity, in a secret conference with the prince, to lament his own situation, and to persuade his highness that Lord Rochester had the only influence in the palace, and privately counteracted all his designs. The prince, on his part, resented the denial of his request, and his exclusion from public business. It was not long before Lord Rochester discovered the earl of Salisbury's practice against him with the prince; to whom he therefore went to clear himself. But his highness turned from him with great indignation, and would not hear his justification. The queen likewise, highly displeased with the viscount, refused to see him, and sought all means of lessening his power. This forwardness imputed to the prince by the historian, in endeavouring to intrude himself into the management of public affairs, is not (as Dr Birch remarks) at all suitable to the character of his highness, or to any other accounts which we have of him; nor ought it to be believed upon the credit of a writer who cites no authority for it, nor indeed for scarce any other assertions in his history, how extraordinary foever they appear to be, and who frequently ventures to enlarge upon subjects which it was impossible for him to have known. However, it is not much to be doubted, that the prince had no great esteem for Lord Rochester, whose rise to the power of a favourite and a minister he so much disliked, if we may believe a satirical writer of Memoirs, that he was reported either to have struck his lordship on the back with a racket, or very hardly forborne it. And another historian, not much less satirical, Arthur Wilson, mentions the bickerings betwixt the prince and the viscount; and that Sir Francis Elphinston observing his highness one day to be discontented with the viscount, offered to kill him; and which the prince reproved him, and said that if there were cause he would do it himself. But to waive such very suspicious authorities, it will be sufficient, in order to judge of his highness's opinion of the viscount, and his administration at the very height of it, to hear what himself says in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes of\nof the 10th of September 1612; \"As matters go now here, I will deal in no businesse of importance for some respects.\"\n\nIt is not to be supposed but that the marriage of a prince so accomplished and so much admired would engage the attention of the public. This was indeed the case. The queen, who favoured the interest of Spain proposed a match with the infant, and the king of Spain himself seemed to be inclined to the match. In 1611 a proposal was made for a double marriage betwixt the prince of Wales and the eldest daughter of the house of Savoy, and between the prince of Savoy and the lady Elizabeth; but these overtures were very coolly received, being generally disagreeable to the nation. Sir Walter Raleigh, at that time prisoner in the Tower, wrote two excellent treatises against these matches; in one of which he styles the prince \"The most excellent and hopeful,\" as he does also in the introduction to his Observations on the royal navy and sea-service. About the year 1612, his marriage became an object of general attention. In this affair the king seems to have been inclined to match his son with the princess who promised to bring the largest dowry; the nation at large to have been influenced by motives of religion; and the prince himself to have remained entirely passive, and to have been willing to bethow his person with the most perfect indifference on whatever princess should be chosen for him. This appears from a letter to the king dated 5th October 1612, in which he considers the match with the second princess of France as in a manner concluded. Proposals had indeed been made of sending her over to England for her education, she being only nine years of age at that time; but Villeroy the French minister was of opinion, that this ought to be delayed for a year longer. The reasons assigned by the prince for wishing her coming to England at that time were merely political:\n\n1. Because the French court, by having the princess in their power, might alter her mind as they pleased;\n2. That there would thus be a greater likelihood of converting her to the Protestant religion; and,\n3. That his majesty's credit would be better preserved when both daughters (the eldest being promised to the prince of Spain) should be delivered at the same time, though the conclusion of the one marriage might be much later than of the other. With regard to the exercise of her religion, the prince expressed himself rather in severe terms, wishing his majesty only to allow her to use it in \"her most private and secret chamber.\" He then argues with the most philosophic indifference of the propriety of a match with the French princess rather than with one of the house of Savoy: concluding at last in the following words: \"If I have incurred in the same error that I did last by the indifference of my opinion, I humbly crave pardon of your majesty, holding it fitter for your majesty to resolve what course is most convenient to be taken by the rules of the state, than for me who am so little acquainted with subjects of that nature: and besides, your majesty may think, that my part to play, which is to be in love with any of them, is not yet at hand.\"\n\nOn the whole, it appeared, that there never was any real design in the king or prince to bring this matter to a conclusion; and that the proposal had been made only with a view to break off the match of the eldest daughter with the prince of Spain, which could not now be done.\n\nPrince Henry, notwithstanding his indifference in matrimonial matters, applied himself with the utmost affluence to his former employments and exercises, the continual fatigue of which was thought to impair his health. In the 19th year of his age his constitution seemed to undergo a remarkable change: he began to appear pale and thin, and to be more retired and serious than usual. He complained now and then of a giddiness and heavy pain in his forehead, which obliged him to stroke up his brow before he put on his hat; he frequently bled at the nose, which gave great relief, though the discharge stopped some time before his death. These forebodings of a dangerous malady were totally neglected both by himself and his attendants, even after he began to be seized at intervals with fainting fits. Notwithstanding these alarming symptoms, he continued his usual employments. On the arrival of Count de Nassau in England, he waited upon him as though nothing had been the matter; and when the subject of the princess Elizabeth's marriage came to be canvassed, he interested himself deeply in the affair, and never desisted till the match with the elector palatine was concluded. In the beginning of June 1612, the prince went to Richmond, where he continued till the progress: and notwithstanding the complaints above mentioned, he now took the opportunity of the neighbourhood of the Thames to learn to swim. This practice in an evening, and after supper, was discommended by several of his attendants; and was supposed to have stopped the bleeding at the nose, from which he had experienced such salutary effects. He could not, however, be prevailed upon to discontinue the practice; and took likewise great pleasure in walking by the river side in moon-light to hear the sound and echo of the trumpets, by which he was undoubtedly too much exposed to the evening dews. Through impatience to meet the king his father, he rode 60 miles in one day; and having rested himself during the night, he rode the next day 36 miles to Belvoir Castle, where he met the king at the time appointed. During the heat of the season also he made several other fatiguing journeys, which must undoubtedly have contributed to impair his health. At the conclusion of the progress, he gave a grand entertainment to the court from Wednesday till Sunday evening, when the king and queen with the principal nobility attended at supper. Next day he hastened to his house at Richmond, where he expected the elector palatine, and began to give orders for his reception, also to take measures for rewarding his servants. To some of these he gave pensions, and promised to gratify the rest as soon as possible. From this time, however, his health daily declined. His countenance became more pale, and his body more emaciated: he complained now and then of drowsiness; which frequently made him ask his attendants concerning the nature and cure of an epidemic fever, probably of the putrid kind, which at that time prevailed in England, and was supposed to have been brought thither from Hungary. He now began frequently to sigh, as is usual for persons afflicted with disorders of that kind. The malady increased in the beginning of October, though he used his utmost endeavours to conceal\nconceal it, and occupied himself as usual; only that now, instead of rising early in the morning as before, he would commonly keep his bed till nine. On the 10th of that month he had two slight fits of an ague, which obliged him to keep his chamber; and on the 14th his distemper seemed to be augmented by a violent diarrhoea, which, however, gave so much relief next day, that he infirmed upon being removed from Richmond to St James's, in order to receive the elector palatine. On his arrival there, some of his attendants began to be alarmed by the signs of sickness which appeared upon him, though he himself made no complaint, and even allowed his physician to go to his own house. The elector arrived on the 16th, and the prince waited upon him at Whitehall; but his disease had now gained so much ground, that his temper underwent a very considerable alteration, and he became peevish and discontented with almost every thing: nevertheless he still continued to give orders about what related to the ceremony of his sister's marriage; and kept company as much as he could with the elector and the count de Naillau, with whose conversation he seemed to be particularly delighted. So great was his activity even at this time, that he played a match at tennis on the 24th of October. At this time he exposed himself in his shirt, seemingly without any inconvenience; but at night he complained of a greater degree of languor than usual, and of a pain in his head. Next day, being Sunday, he attended divine service, and heard two sermons; after which he dined with his majesty, seemingly with a good appetite, but the paleness and ghastly appearance of his countenance was much remarked. About three in the afternoon he was obliged to yield to the violence of his distemper; being seized with a great faintness, shivering, and headache, with other symptoms of a fever, which from that time never left him. Several physicians were called; but they differed much in their opinions, if indeed any agreement amongst them, considering the state of medicine at that time, could have been of service. On the 5th of November he was bled; an operation which Dr Butler one of his physicians had hitherto opposed, but now consented to in compliance with his fellows. The impropriety of it was manifest by the thin and dilated state of the blood which was taken away, and still more by his becoming much worse next day. As at that time the Peruvian bark, the great antidote in putrid diseases, was unknown, and no proper methods of treatment seem to have been employed, it is not to be wondered that he sunk under the disease. Among other absurd remedies used on this occasion was \"a cock cloven by the back, and applied to the soles of his feet.\" He expired on the 6th of November 1612, at the age of 18 years 8 months and 17 days. On opening his body, the lungs were found black, spotted, and full of corrupted matter; the diaphragm was also thickened in many places; the blood-vessels in the hinder part of the head were blended with blood, and the ventricles full of water: the liver was in some places pale and lead-coloured; the gall-bladder destitute of bile, and distended with wind; and the spleen in many places unnaturally black. His funeral was not solemnized till the 7th of December following. Many funeral sermons were published in honour of him, and the two universities published collections of verses on this occasion. The most eminent poets of that age also exerted themselves in honour of the deceased prince; particularly Donne, Brown, Chapman, Drummond of Hawthornden, Dominic Baudius of Leyden, &c.\n\nHis highness's family continued together at St James's till the end of December 1612, when it was dissolved; and upon the day of their dissolution, Mr Joseph Hall, his chaplain, preached to them a most pathetic farewell sermon on Revel. xxi. 3. In this he speaks of his deceased master in the highest terms of commendation, as the glory of the nation, ornament of mankind, hope of posterity, &c.; and that he, who was compounded of all loveliness, had infused an harmony into his whole family, which was \"the most loving and entire fellowship that ever met in the court of any prince.\" The exhortation, with which the preacher concludes, is: \"Go in peace, and live as those that have lost such a master, and as those that serve a master whom they cannot lose.\"\n\nPrince Henry was of a comely stature, about five feet eight inches; of a strong, straight, well made body, with somewhat broad shoulders and a small waist; of an amiable and majestic countenance: his hair of an auburn colour; he was long-faced, and had a broad forehead, a piercing eye, a most gracious smile, with a terrible frown. He was courteous, loving, and affable; naturally modest, and even shame-faced; most patient, which he showed both in life and death; slow to anger, so that even when he was offended he would govern it and restrain himself to silence. He was merciful to offenders, after a little punishment to make them sensible of their faults. His sentiments of piety were strong and habitual; and his zeal for the interests of religion was such, that he would, if he had lived, have used his endeavours for reconciling the divisions among his professors. He usually retired three times a day for his private devotion, and was scarce once a month absent from the public prayers, where his behaviour was highly decent and exemplary, and his attention to the preacher the most fixed imaginable. He had the greatest esteem for all divines whose characters and conduct corresponded with their profession; but could not conceal his indignation against such as acted inconsistently with it, and he above all things abhorred flattery and vain-glory in them. He had a thorough detestation for popery, though he treated those of that religion with great courtesy; showing, that his hatred was not levelled at their persons, but their opinions. And he was so immovable in his attachment to the Protestant religion, that not long before his death, as Sir Charles Cornwallis * affirms us, * Discourse of the most illustrious Prince Henry, by Sir Charles Cornwallis, relating to the public, or his own particular interests, collating, or those of others; yet upon the least word or look vol iv. or sign given him of his majesty's disapprobation, he p. 320, would instantly desist from pursuing the point, and return either with satisfaction upon finding it disagreeable to the king, or with such a resolved patience that he neither in word nor action gave so much as any appearance\npearance of being displeased or discontented. He adhered strictly to justice on all occasions; and never suffered himself to determine rashly, or till after a due examination of both parties. This love of justice showed itself very early by favouring and rewarding those among his pages and other young gentlemen, placed about him, who, by men of great judgment, were thought to be of the best behaviour and most merit. And when he was but a little above five years of age, and a son of the earl of Mar, somewhat younger than himself, falling out with some of his highness's pages, did him some wrong, the prince reproved him for it, saying, \"I love you, because you are my lord's son, and my cousin; but if you be not better conditioned, I will love such a one better;\" naming the child who had complained of him. He was of singular integrity, and hated flattery and disimulation: the latter of which he esteemed a base quality, especially in a prince: nor could he ever constrain himself to treat those kindly who did not deserve his love. A nobleman in the highest favour with the king, had written to him, by special command of his majesty, a letter, wherein he recommended to his highness a matter of very great consequence, to be instantly answered; and in his subscription had used these words, \"Yours before all the world.\" His highness directed Sir Charles Cornwallis to draw up an answer, who, having written it, added some words of favour to the nobleman to prelude the prince's signing. His highness having read and considered the letter, allowed it entirely without alteration: But with regard to the words of subscription, notwithstanding the great haste which the dispatch required, he ordered it to be new written, and the words objected to by him to be left out; alleging, that he to whom he wrote had dealt with him untruly and unfaithfully, and that his hand should never affirm what his heart did not think. His temperance, except in the article of fruit, was as eminent as his abhorrence of vanity and ostentation, which began to show themselves when he was very young. When he was taught to handle the pike, and his master instructed him both by word and example to use a kind of stateliness in marching and holding of his hand; though he learned all other things, he would not conform himself to that affected fashion: and if sometimes, upon earnest intreaty, he offered to use it, he would laugh at himself, and presently return to his own more modest and decent manner. And though he was a perfect matter of dancing, he never practised it except when he was strongly pressed to it. The same modesty appeared in whatever he said or did: But it was no impediment to his generous and heroic disposition, which made him perform all his exercises both before much company and the greatest personages. His clothes were usually very plain, except on occasions of public ceremony, or upon receiving foreign ambassadors, when he would assume a magnificence of dress, and an air of majesty, which immediately after he laid aside. Having once worn a suit of Welsh frize for a considerable time, and being told that it was too mean for him, and that he ought not to keep even a rich suit so long; his answer was, that he was not ashamed of his country cloth, and wished that it would last for ever.\n\nIn quickness of apprehension and memory few of the fame age ever went beyond this prince; and fewer still in a right judgment of what he was taught. When he began to have some knowledge of the Latin tongue, being desired to choose a motto out of several sentences collected by his tutor for his use, after reading over many good ones, he pitched upon that of Silius Italicus, *Fax mentis honosque gloria.* And being asked by the king one day, which were the best verses that he had learned in the first book of Virgil's *Aeneid*, he answered these:\n\n*Rex erat Aeneas nobis, quo juvabit alter\nNec pietate fuit, nec bello major & armis.*\n\nReading likewise another verse of the same poet,\n\n*Tros Tyrius mihi nullo discrimine agetur,*  \nhe said he would make use of it with this alteration,\n\n*Anglus Scotusve mihi nullo discrimine agetur.*\n\nBesides his knowledge of the learned languages, he spoke the Italian and French; and had made a considerable progress in philosophy, history, fortification, mathematics, and cosmography; in the last half of which he was instructed by that excellent mathematician Mr Edward Wright. He loved and endeavoured to do somewhat of every thing, and to be excellent in the most excellent. He greatly delighted in all rare inventions and arts, and military engines both at land and sea; in shooting and levelling great pieces of ordnance; in the ordering and marshalling of armies; in building and gardening; in music, sculpture, and painting, in which last art he brought over several works of great matters from all countries.\n\nHe had a just opinion of the great abilities of Sir Walter Raleigh; and is reported to have said, that, \"no king but his father would keep such a bird in a cage.\" And it is affirmed, that his highness, but a few months before his death, obtained the lands and cattle of Sherburn in Dorsetshire, the confiscated estate of Sir Walter, with an intention of returning it to him. That eminent writer, soldier, and statesman, had a reciprocal regard for the prince, to whom he had designed to address a discourse, \"Of the Art of War by Sea,\" which his highness's death prevented the author from finishing. He had written likewise to the prince another \"Discourse of a Maritimal Voyage, with the pallages and incidents therein:\" But this has never yet appeared in print. He had also intended, and, as he expresses it, hewn out a second and third volume of his General History, which were to have been directed to his highness: \"but it has pleased God (says he) to take that glorious prince out of this world, to whom they were directed; whose unspeakable and never-enough lamented loss hath taught me to say with Job, *Verba est in lucem cithara mea, & organum meum in vocem fluentium.*\"\n\nIn the government of his household and management of his revenues, though he was so very young, his example deserved to be imitated by all other princes. He not only gave orders, but saw almost everything done himself: so that there were scarce any of his domestics whom he did not know by name. And among these there was not one even suspected papist; his directions being very peremptory for setting down the names of all communicants, that he might know if there\nthere were any of his family who did absent themselves from the communion. His family was large, consisting of few less than 500, many of them young gentlemen born to great fortunes, in the prime of their years, when their passions and appetites were strong, their reason weak, and their experience little. But his judgment, the gravity of his princely aspect, and his own example, were sufficient restraints upon them; his very eye served instead of a command; and his looks alone had more effect than the sharpest reprehensions of other princes. If any disputes or contests arose among his servants, he would put a stop to them at the beginning, by referring them to some of his principal officers, whom he thought most intelligent in points of that nature, and to understand best what compensation was due to the injured, and what reproof to the offender; so that in so numerous a family there was not so much as a blow given, nor any quarrel carried to the least height.\n\nThough he loved plenty and magnificence in his house, he restrained them within the rules of frugality and moderation, as we have already noticed. By this economy he avoided the necessity of being rigid to his tenants, either by raising their farms or fines, or seeking or taking advantage of forfeitures. Nor was he tempted to make the profit which both law and right afforded him, of such who had in the time of former princes purchased lands belonging to his duchy of Cornwall, which could not by law be alienated from it; for he gave them, upon refusing these lands, a reasonable satisfaction. Neither did his economy restrain him from being liberal where merit or distress called for it; at the same time he was never known to give, or even promise, anything, but upon mature deliberation. Whatever abuses were represented to him, he immediately redressed, to the entire satisfaction of the persons aggrieved. In his removal from one of his houses to another, and in his attendance on the king on the same occasions, or in progresses, he would suffer no provisions or carriages to be taken up for his use, without full contentment given to the parties. And he was so solicitous to prevent any person from being prejudiced or annoyed by himself or any of his train, that whenever he went out to hawk before harvest was ended, he would take care that none should pass through the corn; and, to set them an example, would himself ride rather a furlong about.\n\nHis speech was slow, and attended with some impediment, rather, as it was conceived, by custom and a long imitation of some who first instructed him, than by any defect of nature, as appeared from his having much corrected it by using at home amongst his servants, first short discourses, and then longer, as he found himself enabled to do it. Yet he would often say of himself, that he had the most unserviceable tongue of any man living.\n\nHe had a certain height of mind, and knew well how to keep his distance; which indeed he did to all, admitting no near approach either to his power or his secrets. He expressed himself, upon occasions offered, to love and esteem most such of the nobility as were most anciently descended, and most nobly and honestly disposed. He had an entire affection for his brother the duke of York, and his sister Elizabeth; though sometimes, by a kind of rough play with the former, and an appearance of contradicting the latter in what he discerned her to desire, he took a pleasure in giving them, in their tender years, some exercise of their patience. A writer* of less authority than Sir Charles Cornwallis, from the latter of whom we have these particulars, adds, that the prince seemed to have more affection for his sister than his brother, whom he would often taunt till he made him weep, telling him that if he should be a bishop, a gown being fitted to hide his legs, which were subject in his childhood to be crooked.\n\nWith regard to any unlawful passion for women, to the temptations of which the prince's youth and situation peculiarly exposed him, his historian, who knew him, and observed him much, assures us, that having been present at great feasts made in the prince's house, to which he invited the most beautiful ladies of the court and city, he could not discover by his highness's behaviour, eyes, or countenance, the least appearance of a particular inclination to any one of them; nor was he at any other time witness of such words or actions as could justly be a ground of the least suspicion of his virtue; though he observes, that some persons of that time, measuring the prince by themselves, were pleased to conceive and report otherwise of him. It is indeed asserted, by the writer of *Aulicus Coquinarius*, believed upon good grounds to be William Saunderson, Esq., author of the \"Complete History of Mary Queen of Scotland, and her son and successor King James,\" that the prince made court to the countess of Essex (afterwards divorced from the earl, and married to the viscount Rochester), before any other lady then living. And Arthur Wilson mentions the many amorous glances which the prince gave her, till discovering that she was captivated with the growing fortunes of Lord Rochester, and grounded more hope upon him than the uncertain and hopeless love of his highness, he soon slighted her. The learned and pious antiquary, Sir Simonds D'Ewes, in a manuscript life of himself written with his own hand, and brought down to the year 1637, is positive, that \"notwithstanding the ineffinable Prince Henry's martial desires and initiation into the ways of godliness, the countess, being set on by the earl of Northampton her father's uncle, first caught his eye and heart, and afterwards profited herself to him, who first reaped the fruits of her virginity. But those sparks of grace which even then began to show their lustre in him, with those more heroic innate qualities derived from virtue, which gave the law to his more advised actions, soon raised him out of the slumber of that distemper, and taught him to reject her following temptations with indignation and superciliousness.\" But these authorities, Dr Birch observes, ought to have little weight to the prejudice of the prince's character, against the direct testimony in his favour from so well informed a writer as Sir Charles Cornwallis.\n\nThe immature death of the prince concurring with the public apprehensions of the power of the papists, and the ill opinion which the nation then had of the court, gave immediate rise to suspicions of its being hastened by poison. And these suspicions were heightened by the very little concern shown by some persons in great stations. \"To tell you (says Richard earl of Dorset in a letter to Sir Thomas Edmondes, of the\nWho likewise, in another work, his Memoirs, after\nflaying the prince \"the darling of mankind, and a\nyouth of vast hopes and wonderful virtues,\" remarks,\nthat it was the general rumour at the time of his death,\nthat his highness was poisoned; and that there is in\nprint a sermon preached at St James's upon the dissolu-\ntion of his family, that boldly insinuated some such\nthing. By this sermon Dr Welwood must mean that\nof Mr Hall cited above; in which, however, at least as\nit is reprinted in the London edition of his works in\n1617, in folio, there is not to be found any expres-\nsion that carries the least insinuation of that kind. The\nwriter of the memoirs adds, that Sir Francis Bacon, in\nhis speech at the trial of the earl of Somerset, had\nsome reflections upon the intimacy of that lord with\nSir Thomas Overbury, which seemed to point that\nway; there being several expressions left out of the\nprinted copy that were in the speech. Bishop Burnet\nlikewise tells us, that he was assured by Colonel Titus,\nthat he had heard King Charles I. declare, that the\nprince his brother was poisoned by the means of the\nviscount Rochester, afterwards earl of Somerset. But\nit will be perhaps sufficient to oppose to all such sug-\ngestions the unanimous opinion of physicians who at-\ntended the prince during his sickness, and opened his\nbody after his death; from which, as Dr Welwood him-\nself observes, there can be no inference drawn that he\nwas poisoned. To which may be added the authority\nof Sir Charles Cornwallis†, who was well informed,\nand above all suspicion in this point, and who pronoun-\nces the rumours spread of his highness's having been\npoisoned vain; and was fully convinced that his death\nwas natural, and occasioned by a violent fever.\n\nHenry, Philip, a pious and learned nonconformist\nminister, was the son of Mr John Henry, page of the\nback-stairs to James duke of York, and was born at\nWhitehall in 1631. He was admitted into Welfm-\nfield school at about 12 years of age; became the fa-\nvourite of Dr Buthby, and was employed by him, with\nsome others, in collecting materials for the Greek\ngrammar he afterwards published. From thence he\nremoved to Christ-church, Oxford; where, having ob-\ntained the degree of master of arts, he was taken into\nthe family of Judge Puleton, at Emeral in Flintshire,\nas tutor to his sons, and to preach at Worthenbury.\nHe soon after married the only daughter and heiress\nof Mr Daniel Matthews of Broad-oak near Whit-\nchurch, by whom he became possessed of a competent\nestate. When the king and episcopacy were restored,\nhe refused to conform, was ejected, and retired with\nhis family to Broad-oak; here, and in the neighbour-\nhood, he spent the remainder of his life, about 28\nyears, relieving the poor, employing the industrious,\ninstructing the ignorant, and exercising every opportu-\nnity of doing good. His moderation in his nonconfor-\nmity was eminent and exemplary; and upon all occa-\nsions he bore testimony against uncharitable and schis-\nmatical separation. In church-government he wished\nfor Archbishop Usher's reduction of episcopacy. He\nthought it lawful to join in the common prayer in pub-\nlic assemblies; which, during the time of his silence\nand restraint, he commonly attended with his family with\nreverence and devotion.\n\nHenry, Matthew, an eminent dissenting minister\nand author, was the son of the former, and was born\nHenry in the year 1662. He continued under his father's care till he was 18 years of age; in which time he became well skilled in the learned languages, especially in the Hebrew, which his father had rendered familiar to him from his childhood; and from first to last the study of the Scriptures was his most delightful employment. He completed his education in an academy kept at Ilington by Mr Doolittle, and was afterwards entered in Gray's Inn for the study of the law; where he became well acquainted with the civil and municipal law of his own country, and from his application and great abilities it was thought he would have become very eminent in that profession. But at length, resolving to devote his life to the study of divinity, in 1685 he retired into the country, and was chosen pastor of a congregation at Chester, where he lived about 25 years, greatly esteemed and beloved by his people. He had several calls from London, which he constantly declined; but was at last prevailed upon to accept an unanimous invitation from a congregation at Hackney. He wrote, 1. Expositions of the Bible, in 5 vols. folio. 2. The life of Mr Philip Henry. 3. Directions for daily communion with God. 4. A method for prayer. 5. Four discourses against vice and immorality. 6. The communicant's companion. 7. Family hymns. 8. A scriptural catechism. And 9. A discourse concerning the nature of schism. He died of an apoplexy at Nantwich, when upon a journey, in 1714; and was interred at Trinity church in Chester.\n\nHenry, Dr Robert, author of the \"History of Great Britain, written on a new plan,\" was the son of James Henry farmer at Muirtown in the parish of St Ninian's, North Britain, and of Jean Galloway daughter of ———— Galloway of Burrowmeadow in Stirlingshire. He was born on the 18th of February 1718; and having early resolved to devote himself to a literary profession, was educated first under a Mr John Nicolson at the parish-school of St Ninians, and for some time at the grammar-school of Stirling. He completed his course of academical study at the university of Edinburgh, and afterwards became master of the grammar-school of Annan. He was licensed to preach on the 27th of March 1746, and was the first licentiate of the presbytery of Annan after its erection into a separate presbytery. Soon after, he received a call from a congregation of Presbyterian dissenters at Carlisle, where he was ordained in November 1748. In this station he remained 12 years, and on the 13th of August 1760 became pastor of a dissenting congregation in Berwick upon Tweed. Here he married, in 1763, Ann Balderston daughter of Thomas Balderston surgeon in Berwick; by whom he had no children, but with whom he enjoyed to the end of his life a large share of domestic happiness. He was removed from Berwick to be one of the ministers of Edinburgh in November 1768; was minister of the church of the New Grey Friars from that time till November 1776; and then became colleague-minister in the Old church, and remained in that station till his death. The degree of Doctor in Divinity was conferred on him by the university of Edinburgh in 1770; and in 1774 he was unanimously chosen moderator of the general assembly of the church of Scotland, and is the only person on record who obtained that distinction the first time he was a member of assembly.\n\nFrom these facts, which contain the outlines of Dr Henry's life, few events can be expected to suit the purpose of the biographer. Though he must have been always distinguished among his private friends, till he was translated to Edinburgh he had few opportunities of being known to the public. The composition of sermons must have occupied a chief part of his time during his residence at Carlisle, as his industry in that station is known to have rendered his labours in this department easy to him during the rest of his life. But even there he found leisure for other studies; and the knowledge of classical literature, in which he eminently excelled, soon enabled him to acquire an extent of information which qualified him for something more important than he had hitherto in his view.\n\nSoon after his removal to Berwick, he published a scheme for raising a fund for the benefit of the widows and orphans of Protestant dissenting ministers in the north of England. This idea was probably suggested by the prosperity of the fund which had almost 30 years before been established for a provision to ministers widows, &c., in Scotland. But the situations of the clergy of Scotland were very different from the circumstances of dissenting ministers in England. Annuities and provisions were to be secured to the families of dissenters, without subjecting the individuals (as in Scotland) to a proportional annual contribution, and without such means of creating a fund as could be the subject of an act of parliament to secure the annual payments. The acuteness and activity of Dr Henry surmounted these difficulties; and, chiefly by his exertions, this useful and benevolent institution commenced about the year 1762. The management was entrusted to him for several years; and its success has exceeded the most sanguine expectations which were formed of it. The plan itself, now sufficiently known, it is unnecessary to explain minutely. But it is mentioned here, because Dr Henry was accustomed in the last years of his life to speak of this institution with peculiar affection, and to reflect on its progress and utility with that kind of satisfaction which a good man can only receive from \"the labour of love and of good works.\"\n\nIt was probably about the year 1763 that he first conceived the idea of his History of Great Britain: a work already established in the public opinion; and which will certainly be regarded by posterity, not only as a book which has greatly enlarged the sphere of history, and gratifies our curiosity on a variety of subjects which fall not within the limits prescribed by preceding historians, but as one of the most accurate and authentic repositories of historical information which this country has produced. The plan adopted by Dr Henry, which is indubitably his own, and its peculiar advantages, are sufficiently explained in his general preface. In every period, it arranges, under separate heads or chapters, the civil and military history of Great Britain; the history of religion; the history of our constitution, government, laws, and courts of justice; the history of learning, of learned men, and of the chief seminaries of learning; the history of arts; the history of commerce, of shipping, of money or coin, and of the price of commodities; and the history of\nof manners, virtues, vices, customs, language, dress, diet, and amusements. Under these seven heads, which extend the province of an historian greatly beyond its usual limits, every thing curious or interesting in the history of any country may be comprehended. But it certainly required more than a common share of literary courage to attempt on so large a scale, a subject so intricate and extensive as the history of Britain from the invasion of Julius Caesar. That Dr Henry neither overrated his powers nor his industry, could only have been proved by the success and reputation of his works.\n\nBut he soon found that his residence at Berwick was an insuperable obstacle in the minute researches which the execution of his plan required. His situation there excluded him from the means of consulting the original authorities; and though he attempted to find access to them by means of his literary friends, and with their assistance made some progress in his work, his information was notwithstanding incomplete, that he found it impossible to prosecute his plan to his own satisfaction, and was at last compelled to relinquish it.\n\nBy the friendship of Gilbert Laurie, Esq., lord provost of Edinburgh, and one of his majesty's commissioners of excise in Scotland, who had married the sister of Mrs Henry, he was removed to Edinburgh in 1768; and it is to this event that the public are indebted for his prosecution of the History of Great Britain. His access to the public libraries, and the means of supplying the materials which they did not afford him, were from that time used with so much diligence and perseverance, that the first volume of his History in quarto was published in 1771, the second in 1774, the third in 1777, the fourth in 1781, and the fifth (which brings down the History to the accession of Henry VII.) in 1785. The subject of these volumes comprehends the most intricate and obscure periods of our history; and when we consider the scanty and scattered materials which Dr Henry has digested, and the accurate and minute information which he has given us under every chapter of his work, we must have a high opinion both of the learning and industry of the author, and of the vigour and activity of his mind: especially when it is added, that he employed no amanuensis, but completed the manuscript with his own hand; and that, excepting the first volume, the whole book, such as it is, was printed from the original copy. Whatever corrections were made on it, were inserted by interlineations, or in reviving the proof sheets. He found it necessary, indeed, to confine himself to a first copy, from an unfortunate tremor in his hand, which made writing extremely inconvenient, which obliged him to write with his paper on a book placed on his knee instead of a table, and which unhappily increased to such a degree that in the last years of his life he was often unable to take his victuals without assistance. An attempt which he made after the publication of the fifth volume to employ an amanuensis did not succeed. Never having been accustomed to dictate his compositions, he found it impossible to acquire a new habit; and though he persevered but a few days in the attempt, it had a sensible effect on his health, which he never afterwards recovered.—An author has no right to claim indulgence, and is still less entitled to credit, from the public for any thing which can be ascribed to negligence in committing his manuscripts to the press; but considering the difficulties which Dr Henry surmounted, and the accurate research and information which distinguished his history, the circumstances which have been mentioned are far from being uninteresting, and must add considerably to the opinion formed of his merit among men who are judges of what he has done. He did not profess to study the ornaments of language; but his arrangement is uniformly regular and natural, and his style simple and perspicuous. More than this he has not attempted, and this cannot be denied him. He believed that the time which might be spent in polishing or rounding a sentence, was more usefully employed in investigating and ascertaining a fact: And as a book of facts and solid information, supported by authentic documents, his history will stand a comparison with any other history of the same period.\n\nBut Dr Henry had other difficulties to surmount than those which related to the composition of his work. Not having been able to transact with the bookellers to his satisfaction, the five volumes were originally published at the risk of the author. When the first volume appeared, it was censured with an unexampled acrimony and perseverance. Magazines, reviews, and even newspapers, were filled with abusive remarks and invectives, in which both the author and the book were treated with contempt and scurrility. When an author has once submitted his works to the public, he has no right to complain of the just severity of criticism. But Dr Henry had to contend with the inveterate scorn of malignity. In compliance with the usual custom, he had permitted a sermon to be published which he had preached before the society in Scotland for propagating Christian knowledge in 1773; a composition containing plain good sense on a common subject, from which he expected no reputation. This was eagerly seized on by the adversaries of his History, and torn to pieces with a virulence and asperity which no want of merit in the sermon could justify or explain. An anonymous letter had appeared in a newspaper to vindicate the History from some of the unjust censures which had been published, and afflicting from the real merit and accuracy of the book the author's title to the approbation of the public. An answer appeared in the course of the following week, charging him, in terms equally confident and indecent, with having written this letter in his own praise. The efforts of malignity seldom fail to defeat their purpose, and to recoil on those who direct them. Dr Henry had many friends, and till lately had not discovered that he had any enemies. But the author of the anonymous vindication was unknown to him, till the learned and respectable Dr Macqueen, from the indignation excited by the confident petulance of the answer, informed him that the letter had been written by him. These anecdotes are still remembered. The abuse of the History, which began in Scotland, was renewed in some of the periodical publications in South Britain; though it is justice to add (without meaning to refer to the candid observations of English critics), that in both kingdoms the asperity originated in the same quarter, and that paragraphs and criticisms written at Edinburgh were printed in London. The same spirit\nspirit appeared in Strictures published on the second and third volumes; but by this time it had in a great measure lost the attention of the public. The malevolence was sufficiently understood, and had long before become fatal to the circulation of the periodical paper from which it originally proceeded. The book, though printed for the author, had sold beyond his most sanguine expectations; and had received both praise and patronage from men of the first literary characters in the kingdom: and though, from the alarm which had been raised, the bookellers did not venture to purchase the property till after the publication of the fifth volume, the work was established in the opinion of the public, and at last rewarded the author with a high degree of celebrity, which he happily lived to enjoy.\n\nIn an article relating to Dr Henry's life, not to have mentioned the opposition which his History encountered, would have been both affectation and injustice. The facts are sufficiently remembered, and are unfortunately too recent to be more minutely explained. That they contributed at first to retard the sale of the work is undeniable, and may be told without regret now that its reputation is established. The book has raised itself to eminence as a History of Great Britain by its own merits; and the means employed to obstruct its progress have only served to embellish its success.\n\nDr Henry was no doubt encouraged from the first by the decided approbation of some of his literary friends, who were allowed to be the most competent judges of his subject; and in particular by one of the most eminent historians of the present age, whose history of the same periods justly possesses the highest reputation. The following character of the first and second volumes was drawn up by that gentleman, and is well intitled to be inserted in a narrative of Dr Henry's life. \"Those who profess a high esteem for the first volume of Dr Henry's history, I may venture to say, are almost as numerous as those who have perused it, provided they be competent judges of a work of that nature, and are acquainted with the difficulties which attend such an undertaking. Many of those who had been so well pleased with the first were impatient to see the second volume, which advances into a field more delicate and interesting; but the Doctor hath shown the maturity of his judgment, as in all the rest, so particularly in giving no performance to the public that might appear crude or halting, or composed before he had fully collected and digested the materials. I venture with great sincerity to recommend this volume to the perusal of every curious reader who desires to know the state of Great Britain in a period which has hitherto been regarded as very obscure, ill supplied with writers, and not possessed of a single one that deserves the appellation of a good one. It is wonderful what an instructive, and even entertaining, book the Doctor has been able to compose from such unpromising materials: Tantum series juncturaque pollet. When we see those barbarous ages delineated by so able a pen, we admire the oddness and singularity of the manners, customs, and opinions, of the times, and seem to be introduced into a new world; but we are still more surprised, as well as interested, when we reflect that those strange personages were the ancestors of the present inhabitants of this island.—The object of an antiquary hath been commonly distinguished from that of an historian; for though the latter should enter into the province of the former, it is thought that it should only be quanto basta, that is, so far as is necessary, without comprehending all the minute disquisitions which give such supreme pleasure to the mere antiquary. Our learned author hath fully reconciled these two characters. His historical narrative is as full as those remote times seem to demand, and at the same time his inquiries of the antiquarian kind omit nothing which can be an object of doubt or curiosity. The one as well as the other is delivered with great perspicuity, and no less propriety, which are the true ornaments of this kind of writing. All superfluous embellishments are avoided; and the reader will hardly find in our language any performance that unites together so perfectly the two great points of entertainment and instruction.\"—The gentleman who wrote this character died before the publication of the third volume.—The progress of his work introduced Dr Henry to more extensive patronage, and in particular to the notice and esteem of the earl of Mansfield. That venerable nobleman, who is so well intitled to the gratitude and admiration of his country, thought the merit of Dr Henry's history so considerable, that, without any solicitation, after the publication of the fourth volume he applied personally to his majesty to bestow on the author some mark of his royal favour. In consequence of this, Dr Henry was informed by a letter from Lord Stormont, the secretary of state, of his Majesty's intention to confer on him an annual pension for life of £100. \"Considering his distinguished talents and great literary merit, and the importance of the very useful and laborious work in which he was so successfully engaged, as titles to his royal countenance and favour.\" The warrant was issued on the 28th of May 1781; and his right to the pension commenced from the 5th of April preceding. This pension he enjoyed till his death, and always considered it as inferring a new obligation to persevere steadily in the prosecution of his work. From the earl of Mansfield he received many other testimonies of esteem both as a man and as an author, which he was often heard to mention with the most affectionate gratitude. The octavo edition of his history, published in 1778, was inscribed to his lordship. The quarto edition had been dedicated to the king.\n\nThe property of the work had hitherto remained with himself. But in April 1786, when an octavo edition was intended, he conveyed the property to Messrs Cadell and Strachan; referring to himself what still remained unfold of the quarto edition, which did not then exceed eighty-one complete sets. A few copies were afterwards printed of the volumes of which the first impression was exhausted, to make up additional sets: and before the end of 1786, he sold the whole to Messrs Cadell and Strachan. By the first transaction he was to receive £100, and by the second between £300 and £400; about £1400 in all. These sums may not be absolutely exact, as they are set down from memory; but there cannot be a mistake of any consequence on the one side or the other.—Dr Henry had kept very accurate accounts of the sales from the time of the original publication; and after\nHEPATIC, in Medicine and Anatomy, anything belonging to the liver.\n\nHEPATIC Air, or Sulphurated Hydrogen Gas, a permanently elastic fluid of a very disagreeable odour something like that of rotten eggs.

See Medicine Index.\n\nHEPATOSCOPIA, (formed of ἡπατικός, liver, and σκοπεῖν, I consider), in antiquity, a species of divination, wherein predictions were made by inspecting the livers of animals.\n\nHEPATOSCOPIA is also used as a general name for divination by entrails.\n\nHEPHAESTIA, in Grecian antiquity, an Athenian festival in honour of Vulcan, the chief ceremony of which was a race with torches. It was performed in this manner: The antagonists were three young men, one of whom, by lot, took a lighted torch in his hand, and began his course; if the torch was extinguished before he finished the race, he delivered it to the second; and he in like manner to the third: the victory was his who first carried the torch lighted to the end of the race; and to this successive delivering of the torch we find many allusions in ancient writers.\n\nHEPTHIMIMERIS (composed of ἑπτά, seven, ἅμισυς, half, and μέρος, part), in the Greek and Latin poetry, a sort of verse consisting of three feet and a syllable; that is, of seven half feet.\n\nSuch are most of the verses in Anacreon:\n\n| Θέλω | λέγειν | Ἀτέλης | δας |\n|-------|--------|--------|-----|\n| Θέλω | διὰ Καῦς | μεν α | διν, &c. |\n\nAnd that of Aristophanes, in his Plutus:\n\nΕἰσίθει παρὰ τὸ γούνιον.\n\nThey are also called trimeter catalectic.\n\nHEPTHIMIMERIS, or Hephthimimeres, is also a caesura after the third foot; that is, on the seventh half-foot. It is a rule, that this syllable, though it be short in itself, must be made long on account of the caesura, or to make it an hephthimimeris. As in that verse of Virgil,\n\nEt furiis agitatus amor, et conficia virtus.\n\nIt may be added, that the caesura is not to be on the fifth foot, as it is in the verse which Dr Harris gives us for an example:\n\nIlle latus niveum molli fulsus Hyacintho.\n\nThis is not a hephthimimeris caesura, but a hemiemimeris, i.e. of nine half feet.\n\nHEPTACHORD, in the ancient poetry, signified verses that were sung or played on seven chords, that is, on seven different notes. In this sense it was applied to the lyre when it had but seven strings. One of the intervals is also called an heptachord, as containing\nHEPTAGONAL NUMBERS, in Arithmetic, a fort of polygonal numbers, wherein the difference of the terms of the corresponding arithmetical progression is 5. One of the properties of these numbers is, that if they be multiplied by 49, and 9 added to the product, the sum will be a square number.\n\nHEPTANDRIA, in Botany, (from ἑπτά, septem, and ἄνθος, a man); the seventh class in Linnaeus's sexual method, consisting of plants with hermaphrodite flowers, which have seven stamens or male organs. See Classification under Botany.\n\nHEPTANGULAR, in Geometry, an appellation given to figures which have seven angles.\n\nHEPTARCHY (compound of the Greek ἑπτά, \"seven,\" and ἀρχή, imperium, \"government\"), a government composed of seven persons, or a country governed by seven persons, or divided into seven kingdoms.\n\nThe Saxon heptarchy included all England, which was cantoned out into seven independent petty kingdoms, peopled and governed by different clans and colonies, viz. those of Kent, the South Saxons, West Saxons, East Saxons, Northumberland, the East Angles, and Mercia. The heptarchy was formed by degrees from the year 455, when first the kingdom of Kent was created, and Hengist assumed the title of king of Kent immediately after the battle of Eglesford; and it terminated in 827 or 828, when King Egbert reunited them into one, made the heptarchy into a monarchy, and assumed the title of king of England. It must be observed, however, that though Egbert became monarch of England, he was not perfectly absolute. The kingdom which he actually possessed consisted of the ancient kingdoms of Wessex, Sussex, Kent, and Essex, that had been peopled by Saxons and Jutes. As for the other three kingdoms, whose inhabitants were Angles, he contented himself with preserving the sovereignty over them, permitting them to be governed by kings who were his vassals and tributaries.\n\nThe government of the heptarchy, reckoning from the founding of the kingdom of Mercia, the last of the seven Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, lasted 243 years; but if the time spent by the Saxons in their conquests from the arrival of Hengist in 449 be added, the heptarchy will be found to have lasted 378 years from its commencement to its dissolution. The causes of the dissolution of the heptarchy were the great inequality among the seven kingdoms, three of which greatly surpassed the others in extent and power; the default of male heirs in the royal families of all the kingdoms, that of Wessex excepted; and the concurrence of various circumstances which combined in the time of Egbert.\n\nHERACLEA, an ancient city of Turkey in Europe, and in Romania, with the see of an archbishop of the Grecian church, and a sea-port.

See Botany Index.\n\nHERACLIDÆ, the descendants of Hercules, greatly celebrated in ancient history. Hercules at his death left to his son Hyllus all the rights and demands which he had upon the Peloponnesus, and permitted him to marry Iole as soon as he came of age. The posterity of Hercules were not more kindly treated by Eurystheus than their father had been, and they were obliged to retire for protection to the court of Ceyx, king of Trachinia. Eurystheus pursued them thither; and Ceyx, afraid of his resentment, begged the Heraclidae to depart from his dominions. From Trachinia they came to Athens, where Theseus the king of the country, who had accompanied their father in some of his expeditions, received them with great humanity, and assisted them against their common enemy Eurystheus. Eurystheus was killed by the hand of Hyllus himself, and his children perished with him, and all the cities of the Peloponnesus became the undisputed property of the Heraclidae. Their triumph, however, was short; their numbers were lessened by a pestilence; and the oracle informed them, that they had taken possession of the Peloponnesus before the gods permitted their return. Upon this they abandoned Peloponnesus, and came to settle in the territories of the Athenians, where Hyllus, obedient to his father's commands, married Iole the daughter of Eurystheus. Soon after he consulted the oracle, anxious to recover the Peloponnesus; and the ambiguity of the answer determined him to make a second attempt. He challenged to single combat Atreus, the successor of Eurystheus on the throne of Mycenæ; and it was mutually agreed that the undisturbed possession of the Peloponnesus should be ceded to whoever defeated his adversary. Echemus accepted the challenge for Atreus, and Hyllus was killed, and the Heraclidae a second time departed from Peloponnesus. Cleodeus the son of Hyllus made a third attempt, and was equally unsuccessful; and his son Arictomachus some time after met with the same unfavourable reception, and perished in the field of battle. Aristodemus, Temenus, and Chrephontes, the three sons of Arictomachus, encouraged by the more expressive word of an oracle, and desirous to revenge the death of their progenitors, assembled a numerous force, and with a fleet invaded all Peloponnesus. Their expedition was attended with much success; and after some decisive battles, they became masters of all the peninsula. The recovery of the Peloponnesus by the descendants of Hercules...\nHeraclides cules forms an interesting epoch in ancient history, which is universally believed to have happened 80 years after the Trojan war, or 1190 years before the Christian era. This conquest was totally achieved about 120 years after the first attempt of Hyllus, who was killed about 20 years before the Trojan war. As it occasioned a world of changes and revolutions in the affairs of Greece, inasmuch that scarce a state or people but were turned upside down thereby, the return of the Heraclidae is the epocha of the beginning of profane history: all the time that preceded it is reputed fabulous. Accordingly, Ephorus, Cumanus, Caliphenes, and Theopompus, only begin their histories from hence.\n\nHERACLIDES of Pontus, a Greek philosopher, the disciple of Speusippus, and afterwards of Aristotle, flourished about 336 B.C. His vanity prompted him to defile one of his friends to put a serpent into his bed just as he was dead, in order to raise a belief that he was ascended to the heavens among the gods: but the cheat was discovered. All his works are lost.\n\nHERACLITUS, a famous Ephesian philosopher, who flourished about the 66th Olympiad, in the time of Darius Hystaspes. He is said to have continually bewailed the wicked lives of men, and, as often as he came among them, to have fallen a-weeping; contrary to Democritus, who made the follies of mankind a subject of laughter. He retired to the temple of Diana, and played at dice with the boys there; saying to the Ephesians who gathered round him, \"Worst of men, what do you wonder at! Is it not better to do thus than to govern you?\" Darius wrote to this philosopher to come and live with him; but he refused the offer: at last, out of hatred to mankind, he retired to the mountains, where he contracted a dropsy by living on herbs, which destroyed him at 60 years of age. His writings gained him so great reputation, that his followers were called Heraclitians. Laertius speaks of a treatise upon nature, divided into three books, one concerning the universe, the second political, the third theological. This book he deposited in the temple of Diana; and it is said, that he affected to write obscurely, lest it should be read by the vulgar, and become contemptible. The fundamental doctrine of his philosophy was, that fire is the principle of all things; and the ancient philosophers have collected and preferred admirable apophthegms of this philosopher.\n\nHERACLUS, an eastern emperor, was descended from a Cappadocian family, who was sent to subdue the tyrant Phocas, whom he totally vanquished in 610. In consequence of this victory, young Heraclius was raised to the throne by the suffrages of the senate and people. He confined Crispus, the son-in-law of Phocas, in a monastery, whose defection had contributed to his success. Having humbly requested peace from the Persian monarch, who was extending his conquests all over the Asiatic part of the empire, his exorbitant and unjust conditions so exasperated Heraclius, that at once he started from inglorious ease to a conspicuous hero, raised a considerable army by vast exertions, conquered the king of Persia, and established his winter-quarters on the banks of the Halys. He next year penetrated into the very heart of Persia, and having refused the attack of a threefold army of Persians, he surprised the town of Salban.\n\nAnother of his expeditions was against the Tigris, and herald: he fought a battle near the site of the ancient Nineveh in 627, about the end of the year, at which time he gained a complete victory over the Persians, having slain three of their chiefs with his own hand. He recovered 300 Roman standards, and set a vast number of captives at liberty. In 628, he made the Persian king put an end to the persecution of the Christians, renounce the conquests of his father upon the Roman empire, and restore the true cross taken from Jerusalem. When at Emefa, he first heard of the name of Mahomet, who invited him to embrace his new faith, but without success. He brought a reproach on his name by adhering to the doctrine of the Monothelites, but chiefly by espousing his niece Martina for his second wife, by whose influence he divided the succession between Constantine and Heraclonos, his son by Martina. He fell into a dropsical complaint, by which he was carried off in the month of February 641, in the 31st year of his reign.\n\nHERALD, says Vertegan, is derived from the Saxon word Herehault, and by abbreviation Herald, which in that language signifies the champion of an army; and, growing to be a name of office, it was given to him who, in the army, had the special charge to denounce war, to challenge to battle and combat, to proclaim peace, and to execute martial messages. But the business of heralds with us is as follows, viz. to marshal, order, and conduct all royal cavalcades, ceremonies at coronations, royal marriages, installations, creations of dukes, marquises, earls, viceroys, barons, baronets, and dubbing of knights; embassies, funeral processions, declarations of war, proclamations of peace, &c. To record and blazon the arms of the nobility and gentry; and to regulate any abuses therein through the English dominions, under the authority of the earl marshal, to whom they are subservient. The office of Windsor, Chester, Richmond, Somerset, York, and Lancaster heralds, is to be affiants to the kings-at-arms, in the different branches of their office: and they are superior to each other, according to creation, in the above order.\n\nHeralds were formerly held in much greater esteem than they are at present; and were created and christened by the king, who, pouring a gold-cup of wine on their head, gave them the herald-name: but this is now done by the earl marshal. They could not arrive at the dignity of herald without having been seven years pursuivant; nor could they quit the office of herald, but to be made king at arms.\n\nRichard III. was the first who formed them, in this kingdom, into a college; and afterwards great privileges were granted them by Edward VI. and Philip and Mary.\n\nThe origin of heralds is very ancient. Stentor is represented by Homer as herald of the Greeks, who had a voice louder than 50 men together. The Greeks called them ἀναγγελος, and εἰρηνοδόκος; and the Romans, feciales. The Romans had a college of heralds, appointed to decide whether a war were just or unjust; and to prevent its coming to open hostilities, till all means had been attempted for deciding the difference in a pacific way.\n\nHERALDRY,\nHERALDRY,\n\nA SCIENCE which teaches how to blazon, or explain in proper terms, all that belongs to coats-of-arms; and how to marshal, or dispose regularly, divers arms on a field. It also teaches whatever relates to the marshalling of solemn cavalcades, processions, and other public ceremonies at coronations, installations, creations of peers, nuptials, christening of princes, funerals, &c.\n\nArms, or coats-of-arms, are hereditary marks of honour, made up of fixed and determined colours and figures, granted by sovereign princes, as a reward for military valour, a shining virtue, or a signal public service; and which serve to denote the decent and alliance of the bearer, or to distinguish states, cities, societies, &c., civil, ecclesiastical, and military.\n\nThus heraldry is the science, of which arms are the proper object; but yet they differ much both in their origin and antiquity. Heraldry, according to Sir George Mackenzie, \"as digested into an art, and subjected to rules, must be ascribed to Charlemagne and Frederick Barbarossa, for it did begin and grow with the feudal law.\" Sir John Ferne is of opinion, that we did borrow arms from the Egyptians; meaning, from their hieroglyphics. Sir William Dugdale mentions, that arms, as marks of honour, were used by great commanders in war, necessity requiring that their persons should be notified to their friends and followers. The learned Alexander Nisbet, in his excellent system of heraldry, says, that arms owe their rise and beginning to the light of nature, and that signs and marks of honour were made use of in the first ages of the world, and by all nations, however simple and illiterate, to distinguish the noble from the ignoble. We find in Homer, Virgil, and Ovid, that their heroes had divers figures on their shields, whereby their persons were distinctly known. Alexander the Great, delirious to honour those of his captains and soldiers who had done any glorious action, and also to excite an emulation among the rest, did grant them certain badges to be borne on their armour, pennons, and banners; ordering, at the same time, that no person or potentate, through his empire, should attempt or presume to give or tolerate the bearing of those signs upon the armour of any man, but it should be a power reserved to himself; which prerogative has been claimed ever since by all other kings and sovereign princes within their dominions.\n\nAfter these and many other different opinions, all that can be said with any certainty is, that in all ages, men have made use of figures of living creatures, or symbolical signs, to denote the bravery and courage either of their chief or nation, to render themselves the more terrible to their enemies, and even to distinguish themselves or families, as names do individuals. The famous C. Agrippa, in his treatise of the vanity of sciences, cap. 81, has collected many instances of these marks of distinction, anciently borne by kingdoms and states that were any way civilized, viz.\n\nThe Egyptians bore an ox,\nThe Athenians an owl,\nThe Goths a bear,\nThe Romans an eagle,\nThe Franks a lion,\nThe Saxons a horse.\n\nThe last is still borne in the arms of his present Britannic majesty. As to hereditary arms of families, William Camden, Sir Henry Spelman, and other judicious heralds, agree, that they began no sooner than towards the latter end of the 11th century. According to Father Mabellier's opinion, a French writer whose authority is of great weight in this matter, Henry l'Oiselleur (the Falconer) who was raised to the imperial throne of the West in 920, by regulating tournaments in Germany gave occasion to the establishment of family-arms, or hereditary marks of honour, which undeniably are more ancient and better observed among the Germans than in any other nation. Moreover, this last author affirms, that with tournaments first came up coats-of-arms; which were a sort of livery, made up of several lists, fillets, or narrow pieces of stuff of divers colours, from whence came the fess, the bend, the pale, &c., which were the original charges of family-arms; for they who never had been at tournaments, had not such marks of distinction. They who enlisted themselves in the Croifades, took up also several new figures hitherto unknown in armorial ensigns; such as alarions, bezants, esclop-shells, martlets, &c., but more particularly crofes, of different colours for distinction's sake. From this it may be concluded, that heraldry, like most human inventions, was infinitely introduced and established; and that, after having been rude and unfettered for many ages, it was at last methodized, perfected, and fixed, by the Croifades and tournaments.\n\nThese marks of honour are called arms, from their being principally and first worn by military men at war and tournaments, who had them engraved, embossed, or depicted on shields, targets, banners, or other martial instruments. They are also called coats-of-arms, from the custom of the ancients embroidering them on the coats they wore over their arms, as heralds do to this day.\n\nArms are distinguished by different names, to denote the causes of their bearing; such as,\n\n| ARMS |\n|-------|\n| Of Dominion, Of Patronage, |\n| Of Pretension, Of Family, |\n| Of Concession, Of Alliance, |\n| Of Community, Of Succession. |\n\nArms of dominion or sovereignty are those which emperors, kings, and sovereign states, do constantly bear; being, as it were, annexed to the territories, kingdoms, and\nHeraldry\n\nArms of pretension, are those of such kingdoms, provinces, or territories, to which a prince or lord has some claim, and which he adds to his own, although the said kingdoms or territories be possessed by a foreign prince or other lord. Thus the kings of England have quartered the arms of France with their own, ever since Edward III. laid claim to the kingdom of France, which happened in the year 1330, on account of his being son to Isabella, sister to Charles the Handsome, who died without issue.\n\nArms of concession or augmentation of honour, are either entire arms, or else one or more figures, given by princes as a reward for some extraordinary service. We read in history, that Robert Bruce, king of Scotland, allowed the earl of Winton's ancestor to bear, in his coat-armour, a crown supported by a sword, to show that he, and the clan Seaton, of which he was the head, supported his tottering crown. Queen Anne granted to Sir Cloudely Shovel, rear-admiral of Great Britain, a chevron between two fleurs-de-lis in chief, and a crescent in base, to denote three great victories he had gained; two over the French, and one over the Turks.\n\nArms of community, are those of bishoprics, cities, universities, academies, societies, companies, and other bodies corporate.\n\nArms of patronage, are such as governors of provinces, lords of manors, patrons of benefices, &c., add to their family-arms, as a token of their superiority, rights, and jurisdiction. These arms have introduced into heraldry, castles, gates, wheels, ploughs, rakes, harrows, &c.\n\nArms of family, or paternal arms, are those that belong to one particular family, that distinguish it from others, and which no person is suffered to assume without committing a crime, which sovereigns have a right to restrain and punish.\n\nArms of alliance, are those which families, or private persons, take up and join to their own, to denote the alliances they have contracted by marriage. This sort of arms is either impaled, or borne in an escutcheon of pretence, by those who have married heiresses.\n\nArms of succession, are such as are taken up by them who inherit certain estates, manors, &c., either by will, entail, or donation, and which they either impale or quarter with their own arms; which multiplies the titles of some families out of necessity, and not through ostentation, as many imagine.\n\nThese are the eight classes under which the divers sorts of arms are generally ranged; but there is a sort which blazoners call assumptive arms, being such as are taken up by the caprice or fancy of upstarts, though of even so mean extraction, who, being advanced to a degree of fortune, assume them without a legal title. This, indeed, is a great abuse of heraldry; and common only in Britain, for on the continent no such practice takes place.\n\nWe now proceed to consider the essential and integral parts of arms, which are these:\n\nThe Escutcheon, The Charges,\nThe Tinctures, The Ornaments.\n\nThe shield or escutcheon is the field or ground whereon are represented the figures that make up a coat of arms: for these marks of distinction were put on bucklers or shields before they were placed on banners, standards, flags, and coat-armour; and wherever they may be fixed, they are still on a plane or superficies whole form resembles a shield.\n\nShields, in Heraldry called escutcheons or scutcheons, from the Latin word scutum, have been, and still are, of different forms according to different times and nations. Among ancient shields, some were almost like a horse-shoe, such as is represented by n° 1. in the figure of Escutcheons; others triangular, somewhat rounded at the bottom, as n° 2. The people who inhabited Mesopotamia, now called Diarbeck, made use of this sort of shield, which it is thought they had of the Trojans. Sometimes the shield was heptagonal, that is, had seven sides, as n° 3. The first of this shape is said to have been used by the famous triumvir M. Antony. That of knights-bannet was square, like a banner, as n° 4. As to modern escutcheons, those of the Italians, particularly of ecclesiastics, are generally oval, as n° 5. The English, French, Germans, and other nations, have their escutcheons formed different ways, according to the carver's or painter's fancy: see the various examples contained from n° 6—16 of the figure. But the escutcheon of maids, widows, and of such as are born ladies, and are married to private gentlemen, is of the form of a lozenge: See n° 17—20. Sir George Mackenzie mentions one Muriel, countess of Strathern, who carried her arms in a lozenge, anno 1284, which shows how long we have been versant in heraldry.\n\nArmorists distinguish several parts or points in escutcheons, in order to determine exactly the position of the bearings they are charged with; they are here denoted by the first nine letters of the alphabet, ranged in the following manner:\n\nA — the dexter chief.\nB — the precide middle chief.\nC — the sinister chief.\nD — the honour point.\nE — the fess point.\nF — the nombril point.\nG — the dexter base.\nH — the middle precide base.\nI — the sinister base.\n\nThe knowledge of these points is of great importance, and ought to be well observed, for they are frequently occupied with several things of different kinds. It is necessary to observe, that the dexter side of the escutcheon is opposite to the left hand, and the sinister side to the right hand, of the person that looks on it.\n\nChap. II. Of Tinctures, Furs, Lines, and Differences.\n\nSect. I. Of Tinctures.\n\nBy tinctures is meant that variable hue of arms which is common both to shields and their bearings. According\nAccording to the French heralds, there are but seven tinctures in armoury; of which two are metals, the other five are colours.\n\nThe Metals are,\n\n| Gold, | termed | Or. |\n| Silver, | Argent. |\n\nThe Colours are,\n\n| Blue, | Azure. |\n| Red, | Gules. |\n| Green, | Vert. |\n| Purple, | Purpure. |\n| Black, | Sable. |\n\nWhen natural bodies, such as animals, plants, celestial bodies, &c., are introduced into coats of arms, they frequently retain their natural colours, which is expressed in this science by the word proper.\n\nBesides the five colours above mentioned, the English writers on heraldry admit two others, viz:\n\n| Orange, | Tenny. |\n| Blood-colour, | Sanguine. |\n\nBut these two are rarely to be found in British bearings.\n\nThese tinctures are represented in engravings and drawings (the invention of the ingenious Silvester Petra Sancta, an Italian author of the 17th century) by dots and lines, as in fig. ii. No 1—9.\n\nOr is expressed by dots.\n\nArgent needs no mark, and is therefore plain.\n\nAzure, by horizontal lines.\n\nGules, by perpendicular lines.\n\nVert, by diagonal lines from the dexter chief to the sinister base points.\n\nPurpure, by diagonal lines from the sinister chief to the dexter base points.\n\nSable, by perpendicular and horizontal lines crossing each other.\n\nTenny, by diagonal lines from the sinister chief to the dexter base points, traversed by horizontal lines.\n\nSanguine, by lines crossing each other diagonally from dexter to sinister, and from sinister to dexter.\n\nSir George MacKenzie observes, that \"some fantastic heralds have blazoned not only by the ordinary colours and metals, but by flowers, days of the week, parts of a man's body, &c., and have been condemned for it by the heralds of all nations. Yet the English have so far owned this fancy,\" (the most judicious of them, as Mr Cartwright and others, reprobate it as absurd); \"that they give it for a rule, that the coats of sovereigns should be blazoned by the planets, those of noblemen by precious stones; and have suited them in the manner here set down:\n\n| Or | Topaz | Sol. |\n| Argent | Pearl | Luna. |\n| Sable | Diamond | Saturn. |\n| Gules | Ruby | Mars. |\n| Azure | Sapphire | Jupiter. |\n| Vert | Emerald | Venus. |\n| Purpure | Amethyst | Mercury. |\n| Tenny | Jacinth | Dragon's-head. |\n| Sanguine | Sardonyx | Dragon's-tail. |\n\n\"But I crave leave to say, that these are but mere fancies; and are likewise unfit for the art, for these reasons: 1stly, The French (from whom the English derive their heraldry, not only in principles, but in words of the French language) do not only not use these different ways of blazoning, but treat them en ridicule. 2ndly, The Italian, Spanish, and Latin heralds use no such different forms, but blazon by the ordinary metals and colours. 3rdly, Art should imitate nature; and as it would be an unnatural thing in common discourse not to call red red because a prince wears it, so it is unnatural to use these terms in heraldry. And it may fall out to be very ridiculous in some arms; for instance, if a prince had for his arms an afs couchant under his burden gules, how ridiculous would it be to say he had an afs couchant Mars?—A hundred other examples might be given; but it is enough to say, that this is to confound colours with charges, and the things that are borne with colours. 4thly, It makes the art unpleasant, and deters gentlemen from studying it, and strangers from understanding what our heraldry is; nor could the arms of our princes and nobility be translated in this disguise into Latin or any other language. But that which convinces most that this is an error is, because it makes that great rule unnecessary, whereby colour cannot be put upon colour, nor metal upon metal; but this cannot hold but where metals and colours are expressed.\"\n\nThe English heralds give different names to the roundlet (No 10), according to its colour. Thus, if it is\n\n| Or, Argent, Azure, Gules, Vert, Purpure, Sable, Tenny, Sanguine, |\n\nit is called a\n\n| Bezant, Plate, Hurt, Torseau, Pompey, Golpe, Pellet, Orange, Guze. |\n\nThe French, and all others nations, do not admit such a multiplicity of names to this figure; but call them Bezants, after an ancient coin struck at Constantinople, once Byzantium, if they are Or and Torseau; or of any other tincture, expressing the same.\n\nSect. II. Of Furs.\n\nFurs represents the hairy skin of certain beasts, prepared for the doublings or linings of robes and garments of state; and as shields were anciently covered with furred skins, they are therefore used in heraldry not only for the linings of the mantles, and other ornaments of the shields, but also in the coats of arms themselves.\n\nThere are three different kinds in general use, viz.\n\n1. Ermine; which is a field argent, powdered with black spots; their tails terminating in three hairs. (Fig. ii. No 11.)\n\n2. Counter-ermine, where the field is sable, and the powdering white. (No 12.)\n\n3. Vair (No 15.), which is expressed by blue and white skins, cut into the forms of little bells, ranged in rows opposite to each other, the base of the white ones\n"}
